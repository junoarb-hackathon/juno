PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 24 July 2018, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 19 July 2018 from Rasia and Mr. Borkowski against Armenia (the \"**Request for Arbitration**\"), along with exhibits C-1 through C-60 and legal authority CL-1.\n\n8.\n\nOn 3 August 2018, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n9.\n\nBy letters of 31 July 2018 (Claimants), 28 August 2018 (Respondent), 6 September 2018 (Claimants), 13 September 2018 (Respondent), 24 September 2018 (Respondent) and 25 September 2018 (Claimants), in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Parties agreed that Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, to be appointed as follows:\n\nThe Claimants shall appoint an arbitrator as soon as possible and notify the Respondent of the appointment.\n\nThe Respondent shall appoint its arbitrator and notify the Claimants of the appointment within 45 calendar days of the Claimants notifying the Respondent of the appointment of their arbitrator. In the event the Respondent fails to appoint an arbitrator within 45 calendar days of receipt of [ICSID's letter of September 20, 2018], the Claimants may request the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID to make an appointment on the Respondent's behalf. The Claimants will entertain any reasonable request for an extension of time before making such a request.\n\nWithin 30 calendar days of the appointment of the Respondent's arbitrator, the two party-appointed arbitrators shall attempt to agree on the appointment of a third arbitrator to serve as the President of the Tribunal, with each party-appointed arbitrator consulting with the party having made the appointment; and\n\nIn the absence of agreement between the two party-appointed arbitrators within 30 calendar days as described in paragraph (3) above (or such other period agreed by the parties), the parties shall, through the Secretary-General, jointly request in writing that the Chairman of the Administrative Council designate an arbitrator to be the President of the Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of 6 September 2018, the Claimants appointed Mr. John Beechey CBE, a British national, as arbitrator. On 28 September 2018, after the Parties had confirmed their agreement on the method of constitution of the Tribunal, ICSID sought the acceptance of Mr. Beechey's appointment. By letter of 12 October 2018, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr. Beechey had accepted his appointment.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 18 October 2018 (received by the ICSID Secretariat on 22 October 2018), the Respondent requested an extension of time to appoint its arbitrator. By letter of 22 October 2018, ICSID invited the Parties to communicate any agreement on such extension made pursuant to paragraph (2) of the Parties' agreement on the method of constitution of the Tribunal. The Parties did not revert regarding any agreement, however, the Claimants did not object to an extension.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 5 November 2018, the Respondent appointed Mr. J. Christopher Thomas KC, a national of Canada, as arbitrator. By letter of 12 November 2018, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr. Thomas had accepted his appointment and that, in accordance with the Parties' agreed method, the co-arbitrators would proceed with the appointment of the President of the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nBy email of 26 December 2018, Armenia informed ICSID that it was revoking the power of attorney previously granted to Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and appointing Baker & McKenzie LLP as counsel. An updated power of attorney was provided.\n\n14.\n\nBy email of 20 January 2019, the co-arbitrators informed the Parties of their appointment of Ms. Jean E. Kalicki, a national of the United States, as President of the Tribunal. On 22 January 2019, ICSID sought Ms. Kalicki's acceptance of her appointment.\n\n15.\n\nOn 23 January 2019, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"), the Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Milanka Kostadinova, ICSID Senior Legal Adviser, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal is thus composed of Ms. Jean E. Kalicki, President, appointed by her co-arbitrators; Mr. John Beechey, appointed by the Claimants; and Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n17.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 4 March 2019, by teleconference.\n\n18.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 13 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules are those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language is English, and that the place of proceeding is Frankfurt, Germany. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out the agreed schedule for the proceedings.\n\n19.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed procedural calendar, on 7 June 2019, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits (the \"**Memorial**\") with the expert report of Kiran Sequeira, including appendices A through E and exhibits KS-1 through KS-189; the witness statement of Andrew Thornber; the witness statement of Chad Tappendorf with exhibits CT-1 through CT-10; the witness statement of Joseph Borkowski with exhibits JB-1 through JB-4; exhibits C-61 through C-222; and legal authorities CL-2 through CL-70.\n\n20.\n\nThe procedural calendar contemplated that the Respondent file any request for the bifurcation of the proceeding relating to issues of jurisdiction and admissibility by 15 July 2019. On 15 July 2019, the Respondent confirmed that it would not submit such a request.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter of 2 December 2019, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP would replace Sherman & Sterling LLP as counsel of record. By letter of 9 December 2019, ICSID transmitted additional disclosures from Ms. Kalicki and Mr. Beechey based on the Claimants' notification of new counsel.\n\n22.\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (the \"**Resp**. **Counter-Mem.**\") with the expert report of John H Winner with appendices 1 through 4 and exhibits JW-1 through JW-59; the witness statement of Artur Arakelyan with exhibits AA-1 through AA-7; exhibits R-1 through R-63; and legal authorities RL-1 through RL-58.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of 13 January 2020, the Tribunal asked the Parties to confirm, by 21 January 2020, if they would consent to the appointment of Dr. Joel Dahlquist as Assistant to the Tribunal. The Parties confirmed their agreement to the appointment of Dr. Dahlquist by emails of 24 January 2020 (Claimants) and 25 January 2020 (Respondent). By email of January 28, 2020, ICSID transmitted Dr. Dahlquist's signed declaration.\n\n24.\n\nFollowing exchanges between the Parties concerning their respective requests for production of documents, the Parties' completed schedules were transmitted to the Tribunal on 17 February 2020.\n\n25.\n\nOn 26 February 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the production of documents. Annex A to the Order set out the Tribunal's decisions on the Claimants' requests and Annex B set out the decisions on the Respondent's requests.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter of 31 March 2020, the Parties informed the Tribunal that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they had agreed to extend the time limits for document production and their remaining submissions. Additionally, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to (i) order the Respondent to comply with Procedural Order No. 2 with regard to the organization of document production; and (ii) approve the Claimants' appointment of Dr. Aram Orbelyan, a former Deputy Minister of Justice of the Republic of Armenia, as co-counsel.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter of 1 April 2020, the Tribunal approved the revised calendar and invited the Respondent's observations on the Claimants' two applications by 8 April 2020.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter of 8 April 2020, the Respondent filed its observations, objecting to the Claimants' applications. In response to the Tribunal's invitation, on 16 April 2020, the Claimants submitted their reply. On 17 April 2020, the Respondent sought the Tribunal's permission to submit to the Tribunal only an allegedly privileged document relevant to the application concerning Dr. Orbelyan. By email of 20 April 2020, the Claimants stated that they were content for the Tribunal to review the document proposed by the Respondent to determine its relevance to the case and whether it properly was subject to privilege.\n\n29.\n\nBased on the Claimants' consent, by letter of 21 April 2020, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide the proposed document to the Tribunal for *in camera* review in connection with its privilege claims. On 22 April 2020, the Respondent provided the document, a 29 December 2011 email from Dr. Orbelyan, in English and Armenian, and indicated the portions that it contended were subject to privilege.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of 23 April 2020, the Tribunal upheld the claim to privilege on certain portions of the document and directed the Respondent to produce it (redacted for the privileged portions) to the Claimants. The redacted document was produced to the Claimants on the same date.\n\n31.\n\nOn 27 April 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, denying the Claimants' two applications of 16 April 2020 and deferring to a later stage in the proceeding the Respondent's request for a decision on costs concerning the Claimants' applications.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter of 19 May 2020, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to produce a further limited category of documents. By letter of 22 May 2020, the Respondent objected to the Claimants' request. On 2 June 2020, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to produce, by no later than 12 June 2020, three of the categories of documents requested by the Claimants. The remainder of the Claimants' requests were denied.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of 25 June 2020, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal (i) invite the Respondent to call Messrs. Gagik Grigoryan and Gagik Beglaryan as witnesses or, should the Respondent decline to do so, compel their testimony as non-party witnesses; and (ii) direct the Respondent to explain whether it had searched the files of Messrs. Grigoryan and Beglaryan to identify documents responsive to the Tribunal's order of 2 June 2020 for the production of documents.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter of 1 July 2020, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to deny the Claimants' requests of 25 June 2020 and requested the Tribunal to order the Claimants to provide information with respect to their own document searches. After seeking leave to do so, the Claimants filed further observations on these matters by letter of 7 July 2020.\n\n35.\n\nOn 10 July 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 in which it (i) denied the Claimants' request concerning Mr. Beglaryan; (ii) called upon the Respondent to locate Mr. Grigoryan, but deferred its decision on whether he should be called to provide testimony until after completion of the written phase of the proceedings; (iii) denied both Parties' requests for further document production orders or regarding compliance with previous orders; and (iv) deferred until a later stage in the proceedings both Parties' requests that costs be awarded in connection with these matters. In accordance with the Tribunal's directions, the Respondent subsequently informed the Tribunal that Mr. Grigoryan was residing in Yerevan, Armenia.\n\n36.\n\nOn 13 July 2020, the Respondent filed a Request for Security for Costs with exhibits R-64 through R-66 and legal authorities RL-59 through RL-64. The Tribunal invited the Claimants' comments on the Request for Security for Costs by 30 July 2020.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter of 19 July 2020, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to a three-day extension for the filing of the Reply and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and the Merits until 23 July 2020 and 24 December 2020, respectively. The Tribunal approved the extension on 20 July 2020.\n\n38.\n\nOn 24 July 2020, the Claimants filed their Reply on Jurisdiction and the Merits (the \"**Reply**\") with the expert report of Thomas Harrison with exhibits TH-1 through TH-83; the second expert report of Kiran Sequeira with appendices F through I and exhibits KS-190 through KS-245; the second witness statement of Andrew Thornber with exhibits AT-1 through AT-8; the second witness statement of Chad Tappendorf with exhibits CT-11 through CT-13; the second witness statement of Joseph Borkowski with exhibit JB-5; exhibits C-223 through C-318; and legal authorities CL-71 through CL-132.\n\n39.\n\nOn 30 July 2020, the Claimants filed their Response on Security for Costs with legal authorities CL-133 through CL-137.\n\n40.\n\nFollowing leave granted by the Tribunal, on 6 August 2020, the Respondent filed a Reply on Security for Costs with the witness statement of Van Krikorian with exhibit VK-1, and legal authority RL-61.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants were also granted leave to file a Rejoinder on Security for Costs and submitted it on 13 August 2020, together with the third witness statement of Joseph Borkowski with exhibits JB-6 through JB-19; exhibit C-319; and legal authority CL-138.\n\n42.\n\nAfter considering a request from the Respondent to file further comments on security for costs and the Claimants' objection to the request, the Tribunal granted a final, short round of submissions on security for costs.\n\n43.\n\nOn 19 August 2020, the Respondent filed its Further Comments in Support of Respondent's Request for Security for Costs with the second witness statement of Van Krikorian with exhibits VK-2 and VK-3; exhibits R-67 through R-69; and legal authorities RL-65 and RL-66.\n\n44.\n\nBy email of 21 August 2020, on the date due for its further comments on security for costs, the Claimants stated that they were awaiting a final piece of evidence and asked the Tribunal for an extension until 25 August 2020. The Tribunal granted the Claimants' request.\n\n45.\n\nOn 26 August 2020, the Claimants filed their Further Comments in Response to the Respondent's Request for Security for Costs with the fourth witness statement of Joseph Borkowski with exhibits JB-20 through JB-33; exhibits C-320 and C-321; and legal authorities CL-139 through CL-145.\n\n46.\n\nBy email of 14 September 2020, the Tribunal asked the Parties to provide their comments on the possibility of holding the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits by remote video conference technology, in light of \"ongoing developments in relation to COVID-19, including both health and safety developments and various governmental and other restrictions on movement and gatherings that have been put in place in the various countries in which counsel for the Parties and members of the Tribunal reside.\" The Tribunal offered additional days should a hearing by video conference prove necessary.\n\n47.\n\nOn 14 September 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 with its Decision on the Respondent's Request for Security for Costs. The Tribunal denied the Respondent's request and deferred the question of costs for a later stage in the proceedings.\n\n48.\n\nBy joint email of 7 October 2020, the Parties confirmed their availability for a remote hearing and asked that the Tribunal add 16, 20 and 27 February 2021 as possible hearing dates. The Parties asked that ICSID nevertheless proceed with arrangements for an in-person hearing in Frankfurt in case travel restrictions were lifted by February 2021.\n\n49.\n\nBy email of 8 October 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that, in accordance with the Parties' agreement, it had reserved the additional hearing dates and instructed ICSID to proceed with in-person arrangements in Frankfurt. It expected to make a final decision on the format of the hearing by late November 2020.\n\n50.\n\nBy email of 23 November 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that due to ongoing travel restrictions and the Frankfurt International Arbitration Centre's inability to host a hearing in compliance with local health regulations, it would proceed with plans for a remote hearing.\n\n51.\n\nBy email of 18 December 2020, the Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 6 to facilitate the Parties' discussions on the organization of the hearing and invited the Parties to file comments by 8 January 2021.\n\n52.\n\nBy email of 24 December 2020, the Respondent requested an extension to file its Rejoinder until 28 December 2020 and stated that the Claimants had agreed to this request. By email of the same date, the Tribunal granted the extension.\n\n53.\n\nOn 28 December 2020, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits (the \"**Rejoinder**\") with the second expert report of John H. Winner with appendices 7 and 8 and exhibits JW-60 through JW-81; the witness statement of Gagik Grigoryan with exhibits GG-1 through GG-7; the second witness statement of Artur Arakelyan with exhibits AA-8 through AA-10; exhibits R-70 through R-150; and legal authorities RL-67 through RL-91.\n\n54.\n\nOn 11 January 2021, the Parties notified the Tribunal of the witnesses they intended to call for cross-examination at the hearing.\n\n55.\n\nBy joint email of 15 January 2021, following an extension granted by the Tribunal, the Parties submitted their points of agreement and disagreement on draft Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n56.\n\nOn 20 January 2021, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by video conference. Following the meeting, on the same date, the Tribunal issued directions concerning the hearing and invited the Parties to confer and revise draft Procedural Order No. 6 considering the discussions at the meeting and the Tribunal's directions.\n\n57.\n\nBy letter of 27 January 2021, the Claimants requested (i) the deferral of the testimony of Mr. Thomas Harrison and Mr. John Winner to April 2021; (ii) leave to submit additional documents into the record, and (iii) that the Tribunal order the Respondent to stop using confidential information submitted in the arbitration to conduct discovery against the Claimants. The Tribunal invited the Respondent's comments on the Claimants' 27 January 2021 letter by 1 February 2021.\n\n58.\n\nBy letter of 28 January 2021, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties that due to Ms. Milanka Kostadinova's upcoming retirement from the Centre, Ms. Martina Polasek, ICSID Deputy Secretary-General, would take over as Secretary of the Tribunal in this case.\n\n59.\n\nBy email of 29 January 2021, the Parties submitted a revised draft Procedural Order No. 6, with a point of disagreement concerning the order of witnesses who would testify at the hearing.\n\n60.\n\nBy email of 30 January 2021, the Tribunal directed the Parties on the order of the witnesses, noting that each side was free to determine the order of its witnesses and experts.\n\n61.\n\nBy letter of 1 February 2021, the Respondent objected to the Claimants' application of 27 January 2021 and requested the Tribunal to order Mr. Borkowski to permit KPMG to respond to a request for information made by the Respondent.\n\n62.\n\nBy email of 2 February 2021, the Claimants requested permission to respond to the Respondent's letter of 1 February 2021. The Tribunal granted the Claimants until noon ET on 3 February 2021 to provide their comments.\n\n63.\n\nBy email of 2 February 2021, ICSID asked the Parties to provide further details about the organization of the hearing, including their agreement regarding the use of a 360-degree camera and their availabilities for a Zoom test call.\n\n64.\n\nOn 2 February 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 concerning the organization of the hearing.\n\n65.\n\nBy letter of 3 February 2021, the Claimants provided their comments on the Respondent's letter of 1 February 2021.

The Respondent filed its comments accordingly.\n\n66.\n\nOn 6 February 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7: (i) admitting certain documents proposed by the Claimants into the record; (ii) admitting one item subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions (including the filing of a witness statement by Mr. Weixin and making him available for cross-examination), to be accepted by the Claimants by 9 February 2021; and (iii) granting the Respondent's request to have KPMG confirm the authenticity of exhibit JB-17.\n\n67.\n\nOn 8 February 2021, ICSID, FTI, the court reporter, interpreters and the Parties held a test video conference on Zoom.\n\n68.\n\nOn 8 February 2021, the Claimants submitted documents responsive to paragraph 34(b) of Procedural Order No. 7 and stated they would revert as soon as possible on paragraphs 34(a) and (d). By email of 9 February 2021, the Claimants asked for an extension until 10 February 2021 to file these documents. The Tribunal granted the extension.\n\n69.\n\nOn 10 February 2021, the Claimants filed their documents responsive to paragraphs 34(a) and (d) of Procedural Order No. 7. On the same date, the Respondent noted that the Claimants had indicated that they would not submit a witness statement or make available for cross-examination Mr. Weixin, contrary to the condition for admitting certain of the documents. The Respondent therefore requested that the Tribunal not admit into evidence exhibits C-344 through C-362. The Claimants responded to the Respondent's objections on the following day.\n\n70.\n\nOn 11 February 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, in which it (i) admitted exhibits C-344 through C-346, exhibits C-350 through C-360, and exhibit C-362 into the record; (ii) invited the Respondent to file any responsive evidence to these exhibits by 11 March 2021; (iii) invited the Parties to confirm their availability for an additional Hearing Day on 29 April 2021 to allow additional time for the examination of Mr. Borkowski on Exhibit C-231 and the evidence in paragraph 21 of the Order, as well as any potential testimony by Mr. Weixin and the evidence in paragraph 19 of the Order; (iv) requested the Claimants to provide the ICSID Secretariat with Mr. Weixin's contact details immediately upon receipt of the Order to enable the Secretary of the Tribunal to invite Mr. Weixin to testify as the Tribunal's witness; and (v) directed Mr. Borkowski to refrain from any contact with Mr. Weixin until Mr. Weixin had either declined to testify or concluded his testimony at the April Hearing.\n\n71.\n\nBy email of 12 February 2021, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was not available for an additional hearing day on 29 April 2021. The Respondent requested permission to cross-examine Mr. Borkowski on the newly admitted documents in February rather than April.\n\n72.\n\nBy email of 12 February 2021, the Tribunal took note that the additional hearing day in April would not be necessary.\n\n73.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held by video conference in two parts, the first from 16-26 February 2021 (the \"**February Hearing**\") and the second on 26 and 27 April 2021 (the \"**April Hearing**\"), see paragraphs 88 and 89 below.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe following is a summary of the facts as pleaded by the Parties or established by the evidence, without prejudice to any legal conclusions by the Tribunal, which will be addressed in later sections. The summary is not intended to be exhaustive, and the absence of reference to particular facts or assertions, or to the evidence supporting any particular fact or assertion, should not be taken as an indication that the Tribunal did not consider those matters. The Tribunal has carefully considered all evidence submitted to it in the course of these proceedings.\n\n99.\n\nThe present dispute concerns two separate projects, one for road construction in southern Armenia (the \"**Road Project**\") and the other for a railway in the same part of the country (the \"**Railway Project**\"). These two projects are collectively referred to as the \"**Projects**\" in this Award.\n\n**A. C****ountry** **C****ontext** **\u2013 T****he** **I****mportance of** **I****mproved** **N****orth****-S****outh** **T****ransport**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nWell prior to Armenia's discussions with Rasia, the Government of Armenia had been exploring ways of developing better transport routes to link the north of the country (which borders Georgia) and the south (which borders Iran). As a result of international conflicts, Armenia's borders to the east (with Azerbaijan) and the west (with Turkey) have been closed since the early 1990s. As a result, the only borders open to Armenia are with Georgia and Iran.5\n\nResp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n101.\n\nThe southern region of Armenia has been particularly affected by these events. Although the border with Iran remains open to road traffic, there is no current rail access to Iran; the railway network in the rest of Armenia, which is operated by the South Caucasus Railway Closed Joint-Stock Company (\"**SCR**\"), a subsidiary of Russian Railways OJSC, does not extend to the Iranian border. As for road traffic, the existing road from the capital Yerevan to Meghri at the Iranian border (about 385 km) is not suitable for high speed traffic. For these reasons, Armenia has long aspired to build both a north-south railway and a modern high speed road connecting the north and south of the country.6\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.\n\n102.\n\nWith respect to road development, well before the events at issue in this case, Armenia was in discussion with international development banks about the \"North-South Road Corridor\" (\"**NSRC**\"), an ambitious road development project for which Armenia required outside funding. In 2009, Armenia obtained multi-tranche facility financing of up to USD 500 million from the Asian Development Bank (\"**ADB**\").7 The NSRC was to be carried out in different tranches, of which the southern portion (Tranche 4) was considered to be the most difficult.8 In 2009, the ADB approved a loan of $60 million for Tranche 1, and a feasibility study for subsequent tranches.9 In May 2010, PADECO Co. Ltd (\"**PADECO**\") prepared a report for ADB in which, among other things, it proposed a private-partnership model to finance Tranche 4 in a manner that would limit Armenia's financial exposure and its need to borrow from ADB and/or other development banks.10 This possibility of involving the private sector in the financing of the southernmost portion of the NSRC provides background to the discussions that ultimately progressed between Armenia and Rasia in connection with the Road Project.\n\nR-4, ADB, Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility and Administration of Cofinancing, Republic of Armenia: North-South Road Corridor Investment Program, September 2009.\n\nFirst Arakelyan Statement \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\nC-265, Email from Mr. J.

On 3 October 2011, Rasia signed a confidentiality agreement with Armenia, represented by the then-Minister of Transport and Communication (hereafter the \"**Minister/Ministry of Transport**\"), Mr. Manuk Vardanyan. The confidentiality agreement was signed \"[i]n connection with the pursuit of the development and financing of a road and railway in Armenia.\"11 Later that same month, Mr. Borkowski and Minister Vardanyan met in Armenia, together with then-Prime Minister Mr. Tigran Sargsyan, to discuss the Projects.12\n\nC-85, p. 1.\n\nFirst Borkowski Statement \u00b6\u00b6 14-18.\n\n104.\n\nAlso in late October 2011, Mr. Borkowski approached Mr. Chad Tappendorf and Mr. Brandt Mowry, representatives of the United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund, Aabar Investments PJS (\"**Aabar**\"), about potentially involving Aabar as an investor in the Projects. Aabar and Rasia had previously collaborated on a number of potential investment opportunities, including proposed deals to acquire an NBA basketball team and a Formula One racetrack in New Jersey (neither of which came to fruition), and the restructuring of Gobi Coal, a portfolio company with interests in a coal mining venture in Mongolia.13\n\nFirst Borkowski Statement \u00b6\u00b6 11, 26; First Tappendorf Statement \u00b6\u00b6 17-22; First Thornber Statement \u00b6 18; Resp.

During these negotiations, Armenia's lead representative was Minister Manuk Vardanyan, while Rasia, in addition to Mr. Borkowski, was assisted by several law firms, as well as by representatives from Aabar. Rasia contends that during this period, the Government requested an official letter of support from Aabar that would confirm Aabar's interest in investing in the Projects, and it performed national security checks on Aabar.21\n\nFirst Borkowski Statement \u00b6 63; Second Borkowski Statement \u00b6 160; Cl.

Tappendorf to Minister M. Vardanyan.\n\nFirst Tappendorf Statement \u00b6 11. In December 2012, following Mr. Mowry's departure from Aabar, Mr. Tappendorf was promoted to the position of Senior Investment Advisor to the Chairman of Aabar, Khadem Abdullah al-Qubaisi. *Id.* \u00b6 13.\n\nC-10, Letter from Mr. C. Tappendorf to Minister M. Vardanyan.\n\n110.\n\nIn June 2012, Minister Vardanyan was replaced as Minister of Transport by Mr. Gagik Beglaryan, the former mayor of Yerevan. According to Rasia, Mr. Beglaryan requested a second letter of support from Aabar.25 Mr. Tappendorf provided the second letter on 26 June 2012, describing Aabar's history of \"working closely\" with Rasia on \"investment and co-investment opportunities worldwide,\" and noting Aabar's awareness of Rasia's discussions with Armenia about the potential Projects. Mr. Tappendorf then stated as follows: \"I aim to review the railway and road development projects with a focus on economic feasibility and investment and either directly or through our affiliates consider equity investments and/or lending.\" Mr. Tappendorf also stated that \"either directly or through our affiliates, I will be focused on considering substantial investments \u2026 in ancillary industries such as agriculture, mining and real estate development.\"26\n\nFirst Borkowski Statement \u00b6 63; Cl.

Beglaryan, 26 June 2012.\n\n111.\n\nMr. Borkowski testified that in his view, the \"essence of [the] bargain\" he thereafter struck with Armenia was that \"Aabar was to be the anchor equity investor in the Projects once their feasibility had been established.\"27 Mr. Tappendorf notes that in July 2012, around the time of the Concession Agreements, Mr. Borkowski appointed him to Rasia's Investment Advisory Board, in which role he \"provided guidance on the projects on behalf of Aabar.\"28\n\nSecond Borkowski Statement \u00b6 31.\n\nFirst Tappendorf Statement \u00b6 12.\n\n112.\n\nArmenia observes, however, that neither of Mr. Tappendorf's 2012 letters actually reflected any commitment on the part of Aabar to invest in the Projects,29 much less \"remotely suggest[ed]\" or \"could possibly be said to put Armenia on notice\" that Aabar intended to buy Rasia from Mr. Borkowski.30 This debate becomes relevant to the case for reasons discussed further below.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 4, Hanessian/Borkowski, 660:11-663:13.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.\n\n113.\n\nAs also will be shown below, from the Armenian side, Mr. Beglaryan (the new Minister of Transport) was to be a significant actor in the lead-up to the present dispute.\n\n**C. T****he** **2012 C****oncession** **A****greements**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nOn 28 July 2012, Armenia and Rasia signed two concessions (collectively, the \"**Concession Agreements**\" or the \"**Concessions**\") \u2013 one for the Road Project (the \"**Road Concession**\") and one for the Railway Project (the \"**Railway Concession**\"). The Concessions were signed for Armenia by Minister Beglaryan, and for Rasia (defined as the \"**Concessionaire**\"), by Mr. Borkowski, who was identified as Rasia's CEO and \"Sole Shareholder.\" The Concession Agreements provided the framework for the development of the Projects.\n\n115.\n\nThe Concession Agreements are at the heart of this dispute, and the relevance of various provisions is discussed further below. For present purposes, and without prejudice to the Tribunal's legal analysis, the Tribunal sets out here the provisions that have been discussed in this Arbitration. Some of these are worded identically or very similarly in both Concessions, while others are specific to either the Railway Concession or the Road Concession.\n\n**(1) Purpose of Concessions**\n------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Preamble of both Concessions stated that the Government \"deems it advantageous to have private sector participation in the improvement of its transportation infrastructure so as to benefit from private sector know-how, business connections and capital.\"31 For this purpose, the Government has asked Rasia to implement a project for \"financing, designing, building, rehabilitating, possessing, commissioning, operating and maintaining,\" respectively, (a) a \"new high speed road\" between Sisian and Meghri and/or Armenia's southern border near Meghri (the \"**High Speed Road**\"),32 and (b) a \"new railway\" between the existing operating central railway system and Armenia's southern border near Meghri (the \"**Railway**\").33\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Preamble; C-2, Road Concession, Preamble.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Preamble. Consistent with the Preamble, Article 1 of the Road Concession defined the \"Southern Armenia High Speed Road\" to mean \"a new high speed road between (i) the city of Sisian and (ii) the city of Meghri and/or the [sic] Armenia's southern border near the city of Meghri \u2026.\" *Id.*, Article 1.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Preamble.\n\n117.\n\nThe Preamble of the Concessions also stated that based on preliminary estimates, the budget for constructing the \"new high speed road\" will be \"no less than USD 1.1 billion,\"34 and for the new railway will be \"no less than USD 1.7 billion.\"35 The Concessions acknowledge that \"in addition to any equity investment that Rasia FZE is willing to arrange,\" the Projects implied at least 75% debt financing through secured lending, \"without which implementation of the project may not be feasible\" for Rasia. Successfully attracting such debt financing would substantially depend on Rasia's ability to grant \"legally reliable\" security interests, \"as well as on the availability of a favorable and stable legal framework.\"36\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Preamble. As will be discussed later, Mr. Borkowski testified at the February Hearing that \"this was a number pulled out of thin air,\" because \"[i]t wasn't possible for us at that time to have an accurate number.\" February Tr. Day 2, Borkowski, 354:1-12.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Preamble.\n\n*Id*.; C-2, Road Concession, Preamble.\n\n**(2) Subject of Concessions**\n------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nWith respect to the Road Project, Section 3 of the Road Concession (entitled \"Grant of Concession\") provided in relevant part, and defined collectively as \"the Project,\" the following:\n\nThe Concessionaire shall have the right and obligation at its own cost and risk:\n\n(a) to finance and carry out the Feasibility Study from its own funds;\n\n(b) to implement from its own funds and attracted Project Financing, the following:\n\n(i) finance, design, build, rehabilitate, possess, commission, operate and maintain the Southern Armenia High Speed Road;\n\n(ii) finance, design, rehabilitate, possess, commission, operate and maintain as part of the Southern Armenia High Speed Road any and all infrastructures and facilities in the Concession Territory37 currently or formerly used in the operation of any road \u2026; and\n\n(iii) finance, design, build, rehabilitate, possess, commission, operate and maintain all utilities required or advisable for building, operating and maintaining the Southern Armenia High Speed Road, \u2026;\n\n(c) to do all such other things and carry out all such other businesses as may be necessary or reasonably advisable for any of the above;\n\n(d) to pay to the Government a variable concession fee pursuant to Article 4 [Concession Fee];\n\n(e) to rehabilitate and hand over to the Government the existing toll free road between Sisian and Meghri as reflected in Schedule B within the budget of USD 80 millions (eighty million US dollars); and\n\n(f) to rehabilitate and hand over the Southern Armenia High Speed Road in good working order to the Government at expiration or termination of the Concession \u2026.38\n\nThe \"Concession Territory\" was defined in the Road Concession as \"the territory of the Republic of Armenia south of the city of Sisian.\" C-2, Road Concession, Section 1.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 3.\n\n119.\n\nAs discussed further herein, the Parties dispute whether, and to what extent, Section 3(b) of the Road Concession required Rasia to work to deliver two *separate roads with separate routes* (a new High Speed Road as well as the existing road, rehabilitated), or, alternatively, only *one road* (with some stretches of new construction on new routes, and other stretches simply connecting with the existing road, rehabilitated). The Tribunal returns to this debate in due course.\n\n120.\n\nAs for the corresponding Railway Concession, Section 3 of that agreement provided in relevant part, and defined collectively as \"the Project,\" the following:\n\nThe Concessionaire shall have the right and obligation at its own cost and risk:\n\n(a) to finance and carry out the Feasibility Study from its own funds;\n\n(b) to implement from its own funds and attracted Project Financing, the following:\n\n(i) finance, design, build, rehabilitate, possess, commission, operate and maintain the Southern Armenia Railway;\n\n(ii) finance, design, rehabilitate, possess, commission, operate and maintain as part of the Southern Armenia Railway any and all infrastructures and facilities in the Concession Territory currently or formerly used in the operation of a railway \u2026;\n\n(iii) finance, design, build, rehabilitate, possess, commission, operate and maintain all utilities required or advisable for building, operating and maintaining the Southern Armenia Railway, \u2026; and\n\n(iv) acquire, lease or otherwise arrange the Rolling Stock necessary or advisable for the operation of the Southern Armenia Railway;\n\n(c) to haul freight on the Southern Armenia Railway \u2026;\n\n(d) to carry passengers on the Southern Armenia Railway \u2026;\n\n(e) to do all such other things and carry out all such other businesses as may be necessary or reasonably advisable for any of the above;\n\n(f) to pay to the Government a variable concession fee pursuant to Article 4 [Concession Fee]; and\n\n(g) to rehabilitate and hand over the Southern Armenia Railway in good working order to the Government at expiration or termination of the Concession \u2026.39\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 3.\n\n**(3) Concession Fees**\n-----------------------\n\n121.\n\nPursuant to Section 3(f) of each Concession Agreement, it was anticipated that Rasia would pay concession fees to the Government with respect to each Project. Section 4 of the Concession Agreements described this as a \"fixed concession fee\" of 100,000 Armenian Drams per year for the first 10 years of operation of each Project, followed by a \"variable concession fee\" based on a percentage of the \"annual gross revenue earned\" from the operation of the \"Southern Armenia High Speed Road\" and the \"Southern Armenia Railway\" respectively. The percentage of annual gross revenue would start at 0.1% in year 11 and would increase by 0.1% in each ensuing year, until it reached a maximum of 2% per year, at which point, it would \"remain unchanged thereafter.\"40\n\n*Id*., Section 4; C-2, Road Concession, Section 4.\n\n**(4) Duration of Concessions**\n-------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe duration of the Concessions (identical in both cases) was set out in Section 12 of the Concessions. Essentially, the duration was an aggregate of four periods: (a) a \"Feasibility Study Period,\" running from the date of the Concession Agreements \"until final acceptance of the Feasibility Study by [Rasia] and confirmation of the Corridor by the Government\" (both points addressed further below); (b) a \"Project Financing Period,\" running from the end of the Feasibility Study Period and until Rasia received its first project financing disbursement; (c) a \"Construction Period,\" running from the end of the Project Financing Period and until commissioning of, and grant of permission to operate, the High Speed Road and the Railway, respectively; and (d) an \"Operations Period,\" which would run for 30 years, with an option for Rasia to extend for an additional 20 years (i.e., 50 years in total). If Rasia exercised the extension option, the Parties were to \"negotiate in good faith with respect to making amendments to this Agreement, which are necessary or desirable in the view of any of the Parties.\"41\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 12; C-2, Road Concession, Section 12.\n\n**(5) Conditions Precedent and Waiver Thereof**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nBoth Concessions stated certain conditions precedent \u2013 both to construction (in Section 9) and to operation (in Section 10). Certain of the Section 9 conditions precedent are of particular relevance to this dispute.\n\n124.\n\nIn the Road Concession, the \"Conditions Precedent to Construction\" included, *inter alia*, the following:\n\nConstruction of the Southern Armenia High Speed Road shall commence when each of the following conditions has been satisfied or waived:\n\n(a) \u2026;\n\n(b) Agreement between the Government and the Concessionaire regarding the payment of availability payments by the Government to the Concessionaire (such availability payments when combined with tolls charged by the Concessionaire must, among other things, be sufficient to enable the Concessionaire (i) to repay debt and interest incurred to design and build the Southern Armenian High Speed Road, (ii) to pay for the operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of the Southern Armenian High Speed Road, and (iii) to generate a rate of return on equity sufficient to attract equity investors);\n\n(c) \u2026;\n\n(d) Feasibility studies prepared by one or more first-class specialized firms confirming the technical, commercial, financial, environmental and social feasibility of the Project (collectively, the \"Feasibility Study\") and final acceptance thereof by the Concessionaire. The Feasibility Study shall, inter alia, (i) reflect the territory (the \"Corridor\"), in respect of which the Concessionaire shall have free preferred right-of-way or free preferred right of use, (ii) include working designs, as well as (iii) reflect the construction and commissioning milestones for the Southern Armenia High Speed Road and (iv) analyze the benefit of using the existing North-South Road for certain categories of traffic.;\n\n(e) Confirmation of the Corridor by the Government;\n\n(f) Grant by the Government to the Concessionaire the rights to the Corridor, as provide at Section 22.2 [Corridor Acquisition and Grant];\n\n(g) \u2026;\n\n(h) \u2026;\n\n(i) Execution of the financing agreements for the implementation of the Project sufficient for Concessionaire, among other things, (i) to carry out its obligations under the Construction Agreements, and (ii) to operate and maintain the Southern Armenia High Speed Road until such time as it generates income sufficient to meet its obligations as they become due (Project Financing); and\n\n(j) \u2026..42\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 9.\n\n125.\n\nAs discussed below, several of these conditions precedent proved central to the dispute, including the approach to funding the Road Project (the relationship between potential self-funding through tolls paid by users and Government funding through \"availability payments\"); the expectations of the feasibility study, including regarding working designs and the proposed \"Corridor\" for the Road; and the provisions for project financing in support of Rasia's obligations for construction and initial operation of the High Speed Road.\n\n126.\n\nIn a section of the Road Concession entitled \"Benefit of Conditions Precedent\" (Section 11), these various conditions precedent were classified into one of three categories, and provision was made for the possibility of waiver of one or more of the conditions:\n\n11.1 Each condition precedent shall be classified into one of the following categories:\n\n(a) Conditions for the benefit of both Parties;\n\n(b) Conditions for the exclusive benefit of the Government; or\n\n(c) Conditions for the exclusive benefit of the Concessionaire.\n\n11.2 A Party who benefits from a condition may waive such condition. Conditions for the benefit of both Parties may be waived only mutually.\n\n11.3 Conditions precedent provided at Sections 9(d), 9(h), 9(i), 10(a) and 10(b) are for the benefit of both Parties.\n\n11.4 Conditions precedent provided at Sections 9(a), 9(b), 9(c), 9(e), 9(f) and 9(g) are for the benefit of the Concessionaire.\n\n11.5 In case the Parties mutually agree on other conditions precedent in accordance with Sections 9(j) and 10(c), the Parties will indicate, for the avoidance of doubt, the benefit of such conditions precedent.43\n\nThe interpretation of these waiver provisions is also a subject of dispute.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 11.\n\n127.\n\nThe Railway Concession followed a similar approach, so far as the conditions precedent were concerned. Section 9 of the Railway Concession included, *inter alia*, the following conditions precedent to construction:\n\nConstruction of the Southern Armenia Railway shall commence when each of the following conditions has been satisfied or waived:\n\n(a) Agreement between \"South-Caucasian Railway\" closed joint stock company and the Concessionaire regarding rail linkages between their respective railways \u2026;\n\n(b) Agreement(s) between the Concessionaire and railway operators from bordering countries, as agreed between the Concessionaire and the Government, regarding rail linkages between their railways \u2026 ;\n\n(c) \u2026 ;\n\n(d) \u2026;\n\n(e) Feasibility studies prepared by one or more first-class specialized firms confirming the technical, commercial, financial, environmental and social feasibility of the Project (collectively, the \"Feasibility Study\") and final acceptance thereof by the Concessionaire. The Feasibility Study shall, inter alia, (i) reflect the territory (the \"Corridor\"), in respect of which the Concessionaire shall have free preferred right-of-way or free preferred right of use, (ii) include working designs, as well as (iii) reflect the construction and commissioning milestones for the Southern Armenia Railway;\n\n(f) Confirmation of the Corridor by the Government;\n\n(g) Grant by the Government to the Concessionaire the rights to the Corridor, as provided at Section 22.2 [Corridor Acquisition and Grant];\n\n(h) \u2026;\n\n(i) \u2026;\n\n(j) Execution of the financing agreements for the implementation of the Project sufficient for Concessionaire, among other things, (i) to carry out its obligations under the Construction Agreements, and (ii) to operate and maintain the Southern Armenia Railway until such time as it generates income sufficient to meet its obligations as they become due (Project Financing); and\n\n(k) \u2026.44\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 9.\n\n128.\n\nIn turn, Section 11 of the Railway Construction provided the following, with respect to the \"Benefit of Conditions Precedent\":\n\n11.1 Each condition precedent shall be classified into one of the following categories:\n\n(a) Conditions for the benefit of both Parties;\n\n(b) Conditions for the exclusive benefit of the Government; or\n\n(c) Conditions for the exclusive benefit of the Concessionaire.\n\n11.2 A Party who benefits from a condition may waive such condition. Conditions for the benefit of both Parties may be waived only mutually.\n\n11.3 Conditions precedent provided at Sections 9(e), 9(i), 9(j), 10(a) and 10(b) are for the benefit of both Parties.\n\n11.4 Conditions precedent provided at Sections 9(a), 9(b), 9(c), 9(d), 9(f), 9(g) and 9(h) are for the benefit of the Concessionaire.\n\n11.5 In case the Parties mutually agree on other conditions precedent in accordance with Sections 9(k) and 10(c), the Parties will indicate, for the avoidance of doubt, the benefit of such conditions precedent.45\n\n*Id*., Section 11.\n\n**(6) Feasibility Studies and Acceptance Thereof**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nAs noted above, one of the key conditions precedent to the Projects moving ahead was the preparation of feasibility studies \"confirming the technical, commercial, financial, environmental and social feasibility of the Project,\" and the \"final acceptance thereof\" by Rasia.46\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 9(e); C-2, Road Concession, Section 9(d).\n\n130.\n\nSections 17-20 of both Concessions provided more detail about the preparation and acceptance of these \"Feasibility Studies.\" Section 17 addressed the timing within which Rasia was to commence the Feasibility Studies.47 Section 18 required that such studies were to be prepared taking into account, *inter alia*, the project parameters defined in an attached schedule; Armenian legislation; World Bank environmental, health and safety guidelines for \"toll roads\" and railways respectively; the practices, methods and standards of care and safety that would both reasonably be expected of a \"prudent, skilled and experienced foreign investor\" and consistent with \"good industry practices\"; and the \"terms of reference\" for conducting the feasibility studies.48\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 17; C-2, Road Concession, Section 17.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 18; C-2, Road Concession, Section 18.\n\n131.\n\nSection 19 of both Concessions in turn described the requirements for the \"Terms of Reference\" for the Feasibility Studies, including both their required content and the process by which the Terms of Reference would be proposed by the Government and either commented on or deemed accepted by Rasia.49\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 19; C-2, Road Concession, Section 19.\n\n132.\n\nWith respect to the acceptance of the Feasibility Studies themselves, both Concessions provided as follows in Section 20:\n\n20.1 The Feasibility Study shall be completed within 18 (eighteen) months from its commencement, and in case of being preliminarily acceptable for the Concessionaire, it shall be submitted to the Government in English together with an Armenian translation.\n\n20.2 Within 30 (thirty) days from the date of receiving the Feasibility Study, the Government shall submit its reasoned comments, objections and suggestions, which should be considered by the Concessionaire prior to the final acceptance of the Feasibility Study. Those comments of the Government, which are not attributed to legal, technical or environmental unfeasibility, shall not be obligatory for the Concessionaire.\n\n20.3 If the Government does not submit comments within the aforementioned period, the Feasibility Study shall be deemed finally accepted by the Concessionaire.\n\n20.4 If the Feasibility Study proves the Project unfeasible from technical, commercial, financial, environmental and social standpoint (including in view of the Government's obligatory comments), then upon the Concessionaire's written request made within 15 (fifteen) days the Parties shall undertake negotiations in good faith on such reasonable measures, which may make the Project feasible.50\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 20; C-2, Road Concession, Section 20.\n\n133.\n\nThe timing of the presentation and acceptance of the Feasibility Studies was important for various other provisions of the Concessions. As discussed above in connection with Section 12, \"final acceptance\" of the Feasibility Studies by Rasia was a trigger for the ensuing \"Project Financing Period\" and subsequent periods for construction and operation. In addition, Section 36.2 of the Concessions provided strict deadlines within which Rasia was to present construction designs to the Government, running from \"the end of the Feasibility Study.\" In the case of the Road Concession, Rasia was required to submit construction designs with 6 months; for the Railway Concession, Rasia was required to submit construction designs within one year.51\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 36.2; C-2, Road Concession, Section 36.2.\n\n**(7) Corridor Confirmation, Acquisition and Grant**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nA further condition precedent listed in Section 9 of the Concessions related to the \"Corridor,\" which was defined in that Section as the territory over which Rasia would have a preferred right-of-way for the Road and Railway, respectively. As noted above, Section 9(d) listed two conditions precedent to construction, with respect to the Corridor: (a) the Feasibility Studies were to \"reflect\" the proposed Corridor, and (b) the Government was to \"confirm[]\" that Corridor.52\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 9(e), (f); C-2, Road Concession, Section 9(d), (e).\n\n135.\n\nThe definitions section of the Road Concession (Section 1) defined \"Corridor\" to have \"the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 9(d) [Conditions Precedent to Construction].\" It also cross-referenced a map attached as Schedule B, stating that \"[a]s indicatively shown on the map presented in Schedule B, it is envisaged that the Corridor shall start at the city of Sisian.\"53 The map in Schedule B was cross-referenced in two other places in the Road Concession: (a) Section 3(e), which set out Rasia's obligation to \"rehabilitate \u2026 the existing toll free road between Sisian and Meghri as reflected in Schedule B,\" in addition to its separate obligations in Section 3(b) with respect to a new high speed road, and (b) Section 15, which confirmed, \"[f]or the avoidance of doubt,\" that the existing road between Sisian and Mehri \"as reflected in Schedule B shall continue to be in use and toll free.\"54\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 1.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Sections 3(e), 15.\n\n136.\n\nThe \"indicative[]\" map in Section B of the Road Concession is reproduced below55:\n\nR-63, Schedule B, Southern Armenia High Speed Road Concession Agreement Preliminary Map of Southern Armenia High Speed Corridor; *see also* C-2, Road Concession, Schedule B.\n\n137.\n\nFor greater clarity, the Tribunal also reproduces below a more readable, color illustration drawn from the Respondent's Counter-Memorial, which shows both the existing toll-free roads that were reflected in Schedule B of the Road Concession (in yellow), and the proposed route of the new High Speed Road that was reflected in the same Schedule B (in red)56:\n\nFigure 5: The Proposed vs Existing and Required Routes138\n\nResp. Counter-Mem. p. 32, Figure 5. The Tribunal discusses separately below the significance of the black line in this Figure 5, which is said by the Respondent to reflect a different route that Rasia proposed for the road in its later feasibility study.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 8, McNeill/Grigoryan, 1435:12-24.\n\n138.\n\nThe Concessions contained more detail about the process of confirmation, acquisition and grant of the Corridors. Section 21 of both Concessions provided that if, first, the Feasibility Study for each Project confirmed that the High Speed Road or the Railway (respectively) was \"technically, commercially, financially, environmentally and socially feasible,\" and, second, if the Feasibility Studies were \"finally accepted\" by Rasia, then Rasia \"shall request the Government to confirm the Corridor recommended by the Feasibility Study.\" If the recommended Corridor complied with the requirements of Section 18 (described above), then the Government \"within 90 (ninety) days of its receipt of the Feasibility Study, as finally accepted by [Rasia], shall confirm the Corridor and shall recognize the exclusive prevailing public interest in respect of the lands and immovables in the Corridor.\"57\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 21; C-2, Road Concession, Section 21.\n\n139.\n\nSection 22 of the Concessions in turn addressed the Government's duty to acquire the Corridor lands for purposes of construction. It provided, *inter alia*, that \"[o]nce the Corridor is confirmed by the Government,\" it shall \"within a reasonably short period\" acquire at its costs all lands and immovables in the Corridor, \"on a timely basis so as not to delay the commencement of construction.\"58 Having acquired these properties, the Government would then grant Rasia rights of access, occupation and use to implement the Project, for the entire period of the Concession.59\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 22.1; C-2, Road Concession, Section 22.1.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Sections 22.2, 22.3; C-2, Road Concession, Sections 22.2, 22.3.\n\n**(8) Consortium Approach and Project Financing**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nSections 5 of both Concessions provided, with similar wording, that \"for the purpose of implementing the Project [Rasia] may adopt a consortium approach,\" under which it \"will likely attract investors, international financial institutions, institutional and other lenders,\" as well as \"first-class specialized developers\" for building and operating the Road and Railway. Nonetheless, while Rasia may be \"called upon to closely cooperate\" with these various entities, Rasia alone \"shall always remain fully liable before the Government for the performance of obligations under this Agreement.\"60\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 5; C-2, Road Concession, Section 5.\n\n141.\n\nBoth Concessions also contained similar provisions on the use of external finance providers. Section 31 provided that once the Feasibility Study has \"confirmed that the Project is technically, commercially, financially, environmentally and socially feasible and the Concessionaire has finally accepted the Feasibility Study,\" then Rasia shall have up to 12 months to obtain the requisite project financing.61\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 31.1; C-2, Road Concession, Section 31.1.\n\n142.\n\nHowever, Section 33 of both Concessions provided the following deadlines for the presentation of letters of interest from potential finance providers:\n\n33.1 The Concessionaire undertakes to present to the Government not later than within [Railway Concession: \"12 (twelve)\"] [Road Concession: \"6 (six)\"] months from the date of final approval of the Feasibility Study, letters of interest from one or more credible and reputable potential investors, Financing Parties and other finance providers as described in Section 31.2, according to which such potential investors, Financing Parties and other finance providers are prepared to make investments in the equity or quasi-equity of the Concessionaire and provide debt financing in the aggregate amount not less than the total financing envisaged by the Feasibility Study.\n\n33.2 The Government may within 30 (thirty) days of the receipt of such letters of interest present its written objections to the Concessionaire based on criteria set forth in Section 8 [Control of Concessionaire]. If the Government does not provide its written objections within the mentioned period of time, the candidacies of investors shall be deemed approved, which does not limit, however, the Concessionaire's rights to attract other further parties not objectionable to the Government as per the above procedure.\n\n33.3 In case of any objections from the Government, the Concessionaire may present additional letters of interest within additional [Railway Concession: \"6 (six)\"] [Road Concession: \"3 (three)\"] months.\n\n**(9) Control of Rasia**\n------------------------\n\n143.\n\nSections 8 of each Concession regulated any potential \"alienation\" of Rasia, the direct or indirect shareholding interest in Rasia, and Rasia's \"rights and assets related to the Project.\" Any such alienation was subject to various conditions, including the acceptability of the acquiror to the Government on grounds of national security, and confirmation that the acquiror would be able to provide continuity and proper progress on the Project.62 In addition, Section 8.2(e) of both Concessions provided the Government with certain rights of first refusal, as follows:\n\n(e) the Government shall enjoy rights of first refusal in acquiring shareholding interest in the Concessionaire, including in case of increase of the equity capital, except for any acquisition of the shareholding interest through open auction or any other public tender process.63\n\nA material breach of these rights of first refusal, or of any of Rasia's obligations related to transfer of control of it or its shares, would provide the Government with a right of early termination of the Concession.64\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 8.2(a), (b), (c); C-2, Road Concession, Section 8.2(a), (b), (c).\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 8.2; C-2, Road Concession, Section 8.2.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 8.3; C-2, Road Concession, Section 8.3.\n\n**(10) Exclusivity of Concession**\n----------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Road Concession contained a provision \u2013 a similar version of which was included also in the Railway Concession \u2013 included under the heading \"Competing Transportation Systems\":\n\n**15 NO GRANT**\n\nIn order to induce the Concessionaire to enter into this Agreement and to assume substantial financial and commercial risks in connection with the implementation of the Project, the Government shall not at any time grant to any person, including any State Authority, any concession or other right or privilege to finance, design, construct, possess, commission, rehabilitate, operate and/or maintain any road at the southern border of Armenia or connecting with Meghri or territories adjacent to the southern border of Armenia, including any road not in service on the date of signing this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the existing road between Sisian and Meghri which is in service on the date of signing this Agreement as reflected in Schedule B shall continue to be in use and toll free.\n\n**(11) Early Termination**\n--------------------------\n\n145.\n\nFinally, both Concessions contained similarly worded clauses on early termination based on negative results from a Feasibility Study:\n\n59.1 If the Concessionaire has not accepted the Feasibility Study by the [Railway Concession: \"third (3rd)\"] [Road Concession: \"second (2nd)\"] anniversary of the commencement of the Concession, then the Government may terminate this Agreement with a notice issued within 5 (five) working days following the second (2nd) anniversary of the commencement of the Concession or within 5 (five) working days following any consecutive [Railway Concession: \"two-month\"] [Road Concession: \"one-month\"] period thereafter (provided that the Government is not notified by then about the Feasibility Study being finally accepted by the Concessionaire).\n\n59.2 If the Agreement is terminated due to the Feasibility Study not being finally accepted by the Concessionaire or, prior to the completion of the construction designs, due to the Concessionaire Event of Default, then the Concessionaire shall promptly transfer to the Government free-of-charge the Feasibility Study and all results of the design works, and the Government shall have the right to freely dispose of those at its own discretion.\n\n59.3 Unless the Concession is effectively terminated by the Government's notice, the Feasibility Study works may continue and the Feasibility Study may be accepted by the Concessionaire at any time with a notice to the Government.\n\n**D. R****asia****'****s** **2012 D****iscussions with** **A****abar and** **F****ramework** **A****greement with** **CCCC**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nOn 31 July 2012, three days after the Concession Agreements were signed, Rasia sent a letter to the Government, stating that it had met Aabar to discuss \"the prospects of equity investments\" in connection with the Railway Project. Rasia also mentioned calls with several entities \"to discuss turnkey solutions for railway and road development,\" requests for \"competing feasibility study proposals from two prominent multinational companies,\" and an aim to \"engage world class contractors \u2026 to develop the engineering designs in parallel with the feasibility study,\" rather than addressing engineering \"separately from and after completing the feasibility study,\" which \"could substantially alter project costing, corridor location, and other primary project attributes.\" Rasia requested the Government to begin developing the \"terms of references (*sic*) for feasibility studies.\"65\n\nC-91, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 31 July 2012.\n\n147.\n\nStarting in August and September 2012, Rasia sought to identify a Chinese firm to assist with engineering, procurement and construction (\"**EPC**\") works. It ultimately concluded a Framework Agreement on 30 September 2012 with China Communications Construction Company Ltd. (\"**CCCC**\" and the \"**Rasia-CCCC Framework Agreement**,\" respectively).66 The decision to involve a Chinese EPC firm was made on advice from Aabar's Mr. Tappendorf, who had authored the May and June 2012 letters to the Government about Rasia discussed in Section III.B above, and by his then-superior Mr. Brandt Mowry, who was Aabar's CFO and CIO until he retired from the firm in December 2012. Rasia appointed these two individuals to its Advisory Board in September 2012.67\n\nR-8, Framework Agreement between Rasia and CCCC (\"**Rasia-CCCC Framework Agreement**\"); Cl.

Rasia maintains that CCCC proceeded, during the second half of 2013, to secure financing commitments from China Development Bank and China EximBank.71 Armenia disputes that the evidence demonstrates that any such commitments were obtained from Chinese banks.72\n\nCl.

Its preliminary steps included a trip to Dubai from 3-5 November 2012 to meet with Mr. Borkowski of Rasia and Mr. Tappendorf, who was employed at the time by Aabar, but whom CCCC evidently understood to be a \"senior director\" of Rasia.73 The group then flew to Armenia for a \"working conference\" on 7 November 2012 with officials and engineers from the \"Road Authority\" of the Ministry of Transport, followed by a three-day field investigation of the proposed Road Project from 8-10 November 2012.74\n\nC-96, CCCC, \"Site Visit Report: Southern Armenia High Speed Road Project,\" November 2012, p. 1.\n\n*Id*., pp. 3-4.\n\n151.\n\nOn 10 November 2012, at the conclusion of the Road Project site visit, Rasia and the Republic of Armenia (represented by its Minister of Transport, Mr. Beglaryan) agreed on the \"Terms of Reference for Feasibility Study of the Southern Armenia High Speed Road\" (the \"**Road Terms of Reference**\").75 In the Road Terms of Reference, the Road Project was described \"[a]s defined in Section 3 [\u2026] of the [Road Concession],\" which, as recounted above, provided for a new \"High Speed Road\" and the rehabilitation of an existing toll-free road between Sisian and Meghri.76 The objective of the Road Terms of Reference was stated to be to \"specify the Feasibility Study requirements; reflect main value of the Feasibility Study and the Project, their technical and economic requirements, quality standards, paperwork composition and guidelines on milestones as well as other special terms and conditions\" and to \"reflect the Project limitations including the Corridor limitations on environmental, natural resources use, national security and strategic grounds.\"77\n\nC-98, Road Terms of Reference.\n\nC-98, Road Terms of Reference, Section 2.\n\n*Id.*, Section 3.\n\n152.\n\nThe Road Terms of Reference also set out the purpose of the Road Feasibility Study:\n\nAs defined in Section 9(e) [Conditions Precedent to Construction] of the Southern Armenia High Speed Road Concession Agreement ... confirming the technical, commercial, financial, environmental and social feasibility of the Project (collectively, the 'Feasibility Study') and final acceptance thereof by the Concessionaire. The Feasibility Study shall, inter alia, (i) reflect the territory (the 'Corridor'), in respect of which the Concessionaire shall have free preferred right-of-way or free preferred right of use, (ii) include working designs, as well as (iii) reflect the construction and commissioning milestones for the Southern Armenia High Speed Road. Working designs are preliminary designs that are normally required for establishing project feasibility.78\n\n*Id.*, Section 4.\n\n153.\n\nAmong other things, the Road Terms of Reference also specified that the Road Project would involve \"New construction,\"79 and that while the Corridor for the Road Project was as \"indicatively shown on the map\" in Schedule B of the Road Concession, Rasia could consider variations in the Corridor during the Feasibility Study Period defined in Section 12(a) of the Concession, including certain specified variations.80 The Road Terms of Reference also provided that the road \"should meet the requirements\" for a Class II category road as defined in Armenia's Construction Norms. They listed certain \"selected technical parameters \u2026 in order to provide flexibility to [Rasia] in determining the optimal technical parameters during the Feasibility Study.\"81 The technical parameters that were singled out were the following:\n\nA maximum vertical/longitudinal gradient of 40\u2030 (per mil)\n\nA minimum radius of 600 meters for horizontal curves, 8,000 meters for vertical convex curves, and 4500 meters for vertical incurved curves.\n\nDesign speed to be determined under the Feasibility Study.82\n\n*Id.*, Section 7.\n\n*Id.*, Section 9.\n\n*Id.*, Section 10.\n\nC-98, Road Terms of Reference, Section 10.\n\n154.\n\nThe Road Terms of Reference also set out certain requirements for the \"structure and contents\" of the Road Feasibility Study to be delivered by Rasia,83 as well as a provision stipulating that \"[t]he estimated cost of construction shall be carried out in accordance with international best practices.\"84 The Road Feasibility Study was also to estimate \"investment efficiency in accordance with international best practices,\" including calculations of net present value, internal rate of return, and payback period.85\n\n*Id.*, Section 23.\n\n*Id.*, Section 24.\n\n*Id.*, Section 25.\n\n155.\n\nAs will be explained further below, the Parties disagree as to whether the Road Feasibility Study that Rasia delivered to Armenia met these requirements.\n\n156.\n\nMeanwhile, following the conclusion of its site visit on 10 November 2012, CCCC wrote up a report of its site visit, which made no reference to the Road Terms of Reference that Rasia signed on that date. The CCCC site visit report described its understanding that the project was expected to involve the \"upgrading\" of an existing 110 km highway, but with certain bypasses to improve travel, including a bridge or viaduct over the Tatev valley, a detour around the city of Kapan (involving a new 7 km stretch of highway) and a possible tunnel through a mountain in Kajaran. CCCC indicated that it had proposed a \"preliminary alignment\" for the project on the basis that \"[i]t is mainly an existing road reconstruction and improvement project,\" with \"new-build part[s]\" only in these three sections. CCCC opined that \"most of the sections\" can reach a \"Class II highway\" construction standard, restrained by terrain conditions in certain areas.86 The CCCC report did not specify which Class II standard it had in mind, although as noted above, the Road Terms of Reference signed on 10 November 2012 specified that the relevant reference should be to Armenian standards.87 The difference between Armenian and Chinese Class II highway construction standards becomes relevant later in this case.\n\nC-96, CCCC, \"Site Visit Report: Southern Armenia High Speed Road Project,\" November 2012, pp. 1, 6, 7, 12.\n\nC-98, Road Terms of Reference, Section 10.\n\n157.\n\nOn 10 December 2012, Rasia and CCCC concluded a \"Commercial Agreement for Feasibility Study\" for the Road Project (the \"**CCCC Road Commercial Agreement**\"), which they agreed would become an \"integral part\" of the Rasia-CCCC Framework Agreement they had completed on 30 September 2012. The CCCC Road Commercial Agreement was signed by Mr. Borkowski for Rasia, and witnessed by Mr. Mowry, formerly Aabar's CEO but now identified as \"Vice Chairman\" of Rasia.88 According to this Agreement, CCCC was to prepare a feasibility study to \"serve the very purpose of obtaining Project financing,\" and as a prelude to a \"subsequent EPC contract\" with CCCC.89 CCCC's work on the feasibility study was to be divided into two stages: (a) a \"Stage One\" delivery of a \"Pre-Feasibility Study\" focused on establishing the economic model and base technical requirements for the High Speed Road Project and the selection of the desired road corridor,\" and (b) a \"Stage Two focused on completing the Feasibility Study to a bankable status based on the outcome of Stage One.\"90 CCCC would front all the costs associated with both stages, but Rasia undertook to pay CCCC a \"Services Fee\" of $5 million over time, according to a gradual payment schedule which envisioned only $500,000 being paid (in two tranches) in connection with \"Stage One\" (the \"Pre-Feasibility Study\"), with the rest of the fee deferred until work on and delivery of the \"Stage Two\" Feasibility Study.91 CCCC would retain ownership of, and all intellectual property rights in, both studies, with these rights gradually transferred to Rasia in percentages reflecting the actual payments made to CCCC. In this fashion, \"any CCCC work that has been completed, but not paid for, will remain its property.\"92\n\nR-68, Commercial Agreement for Feasibility Study on the Southern Armenia High Speed Road, 10 December 2012, p. 8.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 3.4.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 4.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 4 & Appendix 1.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 5.1.\n\n**F.

The Railway Terms of Reference also described the Railway Project with reference to the Railway Concession,94 and contained a provision describing the objective of the Terms of Reference identical to that contained in the Road Terms of Reference.95 The provisions defining the purpose of the Feasibility Studies \u2013 Section 4 in both Terms of Reference \u2013 were also identical for both Terms of Reference, save for the project names.\n\nC-99, Terms of Reference for the Feasibility Study on the Southern Armenia Railway between the Republic of Armenia and Rasia FZE, 10 November 2012, Section 2.\n\n*Id.*, Section 3.\n\n160.\n\nOn 10 December 2012, Rasia and CCCC concluded a \"Commercial Agreement for Feasibility Study\" for the Railway Project (the \"**CCCC Railway Commercial Agreement**\"),96 which was substantively similar to the CCCC Road Commercial Agreement. In particular, CCCC's work was to be divided into two stages, the first a \"Pre-Feasibility Study\" focusing on the economic model, base technical requirements, and the \"selection of the desired railway corridor,\" and the second on \"completing the Feasibility Study to a bankable status.\"97 CCCC would again front all the costs, with Rasia undertaking to pay a \"Services Fee\" of $10 million, most of it after the second stage of work.98 Again, CCCC would retain ownership of (and intellectual property rights in) its work until Rasia paid its fee.99\n\nR-67, Commercial Agreement for Feasibility Study on the Southern Armenia Railway, 10 December 2012.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 4.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 4 & Appendix 1.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 5.\n\n161.\n\nOn 21 December 2012, Rasia notified Armenia that it had selected CCCC to prepare the feasibility studies for both Projects.100 Rasia emphasized not only CCCC's design and construction experience, but also its \"favorable financing allocations for overseas railway and road projects\" from China Development Bank and China EximBank, with which CCCC had already begun discussions. Rasia explained that \"[t]he China government is the only feasible source of major loan financing for the [Railway Project] in particular,\" and that \"[n]o other government, private or international financing institution either alone or jointly\" would be able and willing to finance the Railway Project without most of the financing coming from Chinese government banks. Accordingly, Rasia explained, \"[w]orking with a China contractor, such as CCCC, is a mandatory prerequisite for seeking the required China government financing.\"101\n\nC-101, Letter from Mr. J.

Before delving into their delivery and content, however, it is important to identify one threshold factual dispute, which becomes relevant to some of the Parties' legal contentions discussed further herein.\n\n166.\n\nAs discussed above, each of the CCCC Road Commercial Agreement and the CCCC Railway Commercial Agreement provided that CCCC would fund the development of both a \"Stage One\" \"Pre-Feasibility Study\" and a subsequent \"Stage Two\" \"Feasibility Study,\" but that Rasia would pay CCCC for its work over time. Once all such payments had been made, Rasia would become the owner of the Feasibility Studies, with a right to all the intellectual property reflected therein. Although Mr. Borkowski submitted a witness statement in which he maintained that \"Rasia had commissioned and paid for\" the Feasibility Studies,111 he conceded at the Hearing that Rasia had yet to pay CCCC anything.112 The extent to which Rasia remains indebted to CCCC for its Feasibility Study work is disputed in this Arbitration. The evidence on that issue is discussed further in Sections III.I and V.A.3, including in connection with the Parties' dispute over whether Claimants have demonstrated a cognizable investment for purposes of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSecond Borkowski Statement \u00b6 87; *see also* Cl.

Mr. Borkowski stated that Rasia would provide comments on the English-language versions, once received, and then \"officially submit and present the final Stage One feasibility studies for Rail and Road to the Ministry.\"114\n\nBy this time, CCCC had completed at least one other site visit to Armenia, in February and March 2013. *See generally* C-112, CCCC, \"Site Visit Report: Southern Armenia Railway,\" March 2013, p. 10.\n\nC-327, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 17 June 2013.\n\n168.\n\nOn 27 August 2013, Mr. Borkowski requested to \"briefly meet\" with Mr. Grigoryan to provide a \"brief summary of findings\" from the Feasibility Studies.115 The following day, 28 August 2013, Mr. Borkowski met with officials from the Ministry of Transport, including Mr. Grigoryan.116 The Parties describe the discussions differently. According to Mr. Borkowski, he presented a summary of the findings reflected in the draft Road Feasibility Study and made clear that they revealed that it would not be feasible to proceed with a toll road. Mr. Borkowski stated that Mr. Grigoryan was not surprised to hear that a toll road was not a feasible proposition and that, instead, he encouraged Mr. Borkowski to proceed with the Road Project on the basis of so-called \"availability payments.\"117\n\nC-328, Email from Mr. G. Grigoryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 27 August 2013.\n\nC-118, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Prime Minister T.

Day 4, Hanessian/Borkowski, 590:23-591:7.\n\n169.\n\nMr. Grigoryan's recollection of the 28 August meeting differs from Mr. Borkowski's. According to Mr. Grigoryan, Mr. Borkowski \"may have stopped by\" in August 2013, but there was no \"formal presentation\" or \"extensive discussion\" of any preliminary results. Mr. Grigoryan also denies having authorized Mr. Borkowski to finalize the Road Feasibility Study on the basis solely of availability payments.118 However, Armenia has not expressly disputed that Mr. Borkowski informed the Government, at this meeting, that he no longer considered a toll road to be feasible.119\n\nGrigoryan Statement \u00b6 22.\n\nArmenia assumed during cross-examination of Mr. Borkowski at the February Hearing that Mr. Borkowski did take this position at the meeting (see below para. 196). *See also* Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6 75.\n\n170.\n\nWhen, soon after the meeting, Mr. Borkowski forwarded an English-version executive summary of the Railway Feasibility Study, he wrote in the accompanying email that an executive summary of the Road Feasibility Study would follow two days later, \"in print and by email as well.\"120 It is not clear if this was ever sent. However, on 3 September 2013, Mr. Borkowski invited Minister Beglaryan and Armenia's Prime Minister to visit CCCC's headquarters for a \"briefing of the railway and road feasibility study results,\" together with a \"presentation and summary of the alignment along with a positive announcement that the railway is feasible and the road will be a free road.\"121\n\nC-329, Email from Mr. J.

Grigoryan, 3 September 2013.\n\n171.\n\nMr. Borkowski, CCCC representatives and Armenian representatives, including Prime Minister Sargsyan, then met in Dalian, China on 10 September 2013 (the \"**Dalian Meeting(s)**\").122 At the meeting(s), the Prime Minister was briefed on the preliminary results of both Feasibility Studies and provided with estimated future financing steps and timeline. With respect to the Road Project, a slide from Mr. Borkowski's presentation at the meeting indicated as a \"key result\" that the Road Project was \"not feasible as Toll Road; Feasible as Free Road w/Government.\"123 Another slide reflected, as \"Key Needs Remaining\" for the fourth quarter of 2013, the need, first, to translate the final feasibility studies into English and formally to submit them to the Government, and, second, to begin \"pre-construction fundraising of $100 million,\" including initiating talks with the Eurasian Development Bank (\"**EDB**\") and the government of China, for which an \"Armenian Guaranty\" would be \"[r]equired.\" The slide also anticipated, as \"Key Needs\" for the first quarter of 2014, obtaining \"Concession Amendments\" regarding a \"Corridor extension,\" having the Government \"review and confirm corridor for railway and road,\" and having the Government \"assemble and transfer land to Southern Armenia Railway for use.\"124\n\nMr. Borkowski and Mr. Grigoryan seem to disagree as to whether one or several meetings took place in Dalian. *Cf.* Second Borkowski Statement \u00b6 46 *with* Grigoryan Statement \u00b6 23.\n\nC-117, \"Southern Armenia Railway and High Speed Road \u2013 Summary of Key Results From Feasibility Studies\" (Rasia), slide 3.\n\n*Id.*, slide 4.\n\n172.\n\nRoughly a week later, on 19 September 2013, Mr. Borkowski followed up with a letter to Armenia's Prime Minister Sargsyan and Transport Minister Beglaryan, in which he reiterated that a \"toll road structure is not feasible\" for the Road Project, so financing and construction would have to be either \"on a government-to-government basis with long-term, low cost financing from China and the construction handled by CCCC,\" or \"[a]lternatively, Rasia can proceed forward with the road project using availability payments from the Armenian government.\" With respect to the Railway Project, Rasia stated that, having ascertained that it was feasible, it would soon \"move into the financing stage\" after it had submitted the \"final translated versions of the feasibility studies and the recommended alignment for review\" by the Ministry of Transport. Rasia requested Armenia to \"instruct the [EDB] to begin reviewing\" the project.125\n\nC-118, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Prime Minister T. Sargsyan, 19 September 2013.\n\n173.\n\nWhile Mr. Borkowski was communicating these points to Armenia, Rasia also wrote to Aabar. On 13 September 2013, Mr. Borkowski emailed Aabar's CEO, Mr. Mohamed al-Husseiny (with Mr. Tappendorf in copy), describing the Railway Project as a \"government-to-government project with very high level support from China, Armenia, Russia, and Iran.\" He requested \"pre-construction funding of $35 million to take me through the next 3 years building a team and working to complete the project financing from the regional governments and China.\" Mr. Borkowski stated that \"[c]onstruction will ultimately be government-government funded when [it] begins in 2016,\" but \"Rasia requires pre-capex funding of $35 million to fund a development team and complete the project level financing over the next 3 years,\" for which he considered it would be \"possible to get Armenia government guaranty.\"126\n\nJB-4, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. M. al-Husseiny and Mr. C. Tappendorf, 13 September 2013.\n\n174.\n\nIn a subsequent email six weeks later, on 28 October 2013, Mr. Borkowski wrote to Mr. al-Husseiny about the Railway Project, again with Mr. Tappendorf copied. He claimed that Rasia had already had \"many discussions with the [ADB], EBRD, [and the] Eurasian Development Bank\"; that \"both the Russian and the Chinese govt's will likely be debt partners and operators\"; and that he \"would like to now find an equity partner that could help drive this forward with some preliminary funding.\"127 When questioned at the Hearing, Mr. Borkowski said that the \"preliminary funding\" he sought through these emails did not refer to the Railway Project as such, but rather to potential ancillary mining and agricultural ventures along the route of the railway.128\n\nCT-5, Email from Mr. J.

The proposal described this as an opportunity for Arabtec to become \"Master Developer, Contractor [and] Railway Owner,\" controlling \"100% of [the] Project,\" which Mr. Borkowski described as a \"Massive project ($3.2bn EPC)\" for which Rasia had been awarded a \"public-private project[] from Armenian Gov't with monopoly rights and unregulated tariffs for 50 years.\" Mr. Borkowski further identified the benefits to Arabtec as enabling it to \"own and control a \u2026 major energy transport corridor railway\" and to \"[a]dd an exclusive $3.2 billion EPC railway project to its pipeline with the ability to partner with China company,\" all with \"minimal to no cash investment from Arabtec,\" because \"[s]ignificant financing can come from 3rd parties (up to 85% [C]hina banks and 15% ADFD and Eurasian Development Bank).\"129 The proposal to Aabar made no mention of Rasia's prior agreement with CCCC to appoint it (CCCC) \"as the lead member of its Consortium and exclusive EPC for developing\" the Railway Project.130\n\nC-121, \"Southern Armenian Railway \u2013 An Energy Corridor Linking Asia to Europe\" (Rasia, 29 October 2013).\n\nR-8, Rasia-CCCC Framework Agreement, p. 2 and Section 7.\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimants say that at some point in late October 2013, the Aabar CEO confirmed his interest in investing in both Projects, which was communicated to Mr. Borkowski through Mr. Tappendorf.131\n\nFirst Borkowski Statement \u00b6 69; First Tappendorf Statement \u00b6 47.\n\n**(3) Rasia's Delivery of the Feasibility Studies**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nMr. Borkowski met again with Armenian Government representatives, including Minister Beglaryan and Mr. Grigoryan, on 7 October 2013, this time in Yerevan. A few hours before this meeting, Mr. Borkowski submitted a letter to Minister Beglaryan, stating that he would deliver at the meeting certain \"key feasibility study materials\" for both Projects. For the Railway Project, this included an English-language final Railway Feasibility Study, as well as engineering drawings and a \"profile for the recommended alignment\" of the Railway. Mr. Borkowski requested feedback on these documents and \"confirmation of the Corridor.\" He also asked Armenia to \"urgently enter[] into\" a trilateral Memorandum of Understanding with Rasia and the Government of Iran, \"that is essential for the success of the Southern Armenia Railway project.\"132 The Tribunal returns to the Iran issue later below.\n\nC-119, Email from Mr. J.

Instead, the letter referred only to submitting certain drawings showing recommended routes, on which Mr. Borkowski requested feedback and \"confirmation of the Corridor.\" In the meantime, Mr. Borkowski requested as follows with respect to financing of the Road Project:\n\nConsidering that a toll road structure is not feasible for the Southern Armenia High Speed Road project, feedback on whether the Government will prefer to proceed with guaranteed availability payments for the Financing of the Project or to work on a Government-to-Government basis for the Financing and Construction periods with CCCC \u2013 this feedback is required in order to complete and submit the final Southern Armenia High Speed Road feasibility study.133\n\nC-119, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan (attaching letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan), 7 October 2013.\n\n179.\n\nWhereas there seems to be no dispute that the Railway Feasibility Study was submitted to the Government (first the English version on 7 October 2013, and then an Armenian translation on 31 December 2013134), the Parties have different versions of the chain of events by which Rasia made the Government aware of the results of the Road Feasibility Study, including what was discussed in Yerevan on 7 October 2013.\n\nC-116, Railway Feasibility Study; C-127, Email from Mr. J.

Mr. Borkowski recalled that he explained to Minister Beglaryan that \"Armenia had agreed to the availability payments provision under the road concession, and knew from our negotiations of the concessions that the road could not be financed based on tolling alone\"; he said that Minister Beglaryan was upset over this arrangement, to the extent that he threatened to terminate the Road Concession if the Government had to make any availability payments to fund it. Mr. Borkowski says that Minister Beglaryan and Mr. Grigorian did not suggest that Mr. Borkowski's proposal contradicted the Road Concession, nor that a toll element was required under the concession.135\n\nFirst Borkowski Statement \u00b6 53; Second Borkowski Statement \u00b6\u00b6 9, 50-51, 85; February Tr.

Day 4, Borkowski, 725:22-24.\n\n181.\n\nMr. Grigoryan has presented a different account, saying that he does not \"know what Mr. Borkowski is talking about.\" According to his recollection, Mr. Borkowski did not \u2013 at the 7 October 2013 meeting or thereafter \u2013 submit any details about how his proposed availability payment funding scheme would work. Instead, it became clear around this time that Mr. Borkowski's idea of the future of the Road Project differed from the Government's.136 In particular, Mr. Grigorian says he told Mr. Borkowski that \"Armenia is not interested in spending its limited budget funds to finance the Road Project as presented by Rasia.\" He stated that his perception at the time was that Mr. Borkowski understood that Rasia's proposal for the Road Project was \"unworkable and unacceptable on its face.\"137 Mr. Grigorian testified that he and Minister Beglaryan explained during the October 2013 meeting that progressing without a tolling element was not possible: \"We discussed his proposals, and we said that this option was not acceptable for the project which was the subject of the Concession which he had signed.\"138\n\nGrigoryan Statement \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.\n\nGrigoryan Statement \u00b6 28.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 8, McNeill/Grigoryan, 1435:12-24\n\n182.\n\nFollowing a telephone call on 25 October 2013, Mr. Borkowski sent Mr. Grigoryan certain revised pages of a PowerPoint presentation he had used at the earlier October 2013 meetings. This presentation emphasized again that while Rasia considered the Railway Feasibility Study to be \"preliminarily acceptable\" to it, a \"Toll Road Structure\" for the Road Project \"is not [e]conomical,\" whereas a \"[f]ree [r]oad w/ Government Availability Payments is Feasible\" from Rasia's perspective. The presentation stated that the \"Objective\" for the Road Project therefore was \"to adopt feasibility studies and route by end of 2013 and to complete negotiation of agreement on availability payments to implement project.\"139\n\nC-334, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 25 October 2013.\n\n183.\n\nMr. Borkowski ultimately submitted the Road Feasibility Study to the Government on 24 January 2014.140 In the accompanying email, Mr. Borkowski wrote that \"[g]iven the low traffic volume forecasts, this version assumes for now that there is no tolling on the Project (i.e. that this is a free road). Instead, following the adoption of the recommended corridor and the feasibility study, Rasia FZE will rely on availability payments from the government as provided in the concession agreement.\" He added that Rasia nonetheless would explore \"potential tolling and levy strategies for the entire North-South Road Corridor and the Armenian road network to offset the cost of the availability payments\" required to fund the Southern Armenia High Speed Road project.141 This reference to the \"*entire* North-South Road Corridor\" must be taken to mean the broader NSRC road development project that Armenia had been exploring for years with international development banks. From this document, it appears that Mr. Borkowski's proposal at this point was that tolling should not be attempted on the southern Road Project for which Rasia had the Road Concession, but, rather that tolling should be explored on *other* portions of the NSRC, and other Armenian roads for which Rasia had no concession rights, in order to help the Government fund the full costs of construction for the Road Project.\n\nC-122, Road Feasibility Study; C-130, Email from Mr. J.

Grigoryan, 24 January 2014.\n\n184.\n\nAs will be developed further below, this issue of how the Road Project would be financed became a critical stumbling block in that Project's moving forward. The Respondent says that the Road Feasibility Study submitted by Rasia did not comply with the Road Concession because it proposed that all costs be borne by the government through availability payments,142 as opposed to at least in part by tolls, which the Respondent says was required by the Road Concession.143 Rasia disagrees with this reading of the Road Concession; it contends that it permitted, but did not require, the use of tolls.\n\nC-122, Road Feasibility Study, p. 125 (stating that it is \"currently anticipated that the Project Costs \u2026 will be borne by the government of the Republic of Armenia through the provision of availability payments\").\n\nResp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 76-81; *see also* \u00b6\u00b6 510-518 below.\n\n185.\n\nSeparate from the issue of financing, the Parties also dispute whether the Road Feasibility Study complied with various other requirements of the Road Concession and the Road Terms of Reference. For example, the Parties dispute whether there was an agreement to merge the \"two-road\" Project set out in the Road Concession into a \"single road\" project later described in the Road Feasibility Study. They also dispute whether the Road Feasibility Study met some of the technical standards that had been agreed between the Parties in the Road Terms of Reference.144 These disputes are discussed further below.\n\nFor example, the Respondent contends that the Road Feasibility Study used a Chinese technical standard for roads, rather than the applicable Armenian technical standard stipulated in the Terms of Reference, with the result that the Feasibility Study proposed a much lower design speed than the Terms of Reference had anticipated (60 and 40 km/hour rather than 100 and 90 km/hour for different types of terrain).\n\n**H. T****he** **F****ailure of the** **P****rojects**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nNeither the Road Project nor the Railway Project ultimately came to fruition. The reasons and timelines for the failure of the two Projects differ. In this section, the two Projects are discussed separately, beginning with the Road Project.\n\n**(1) The Road Project**\n------------------------\n\n187.\n\nA running theme in this Arbitration is the Claimants' contention that the Respondent engaged in a campaign to undermine the Road Project by seeking to develop a competing southern road in violation of Rasia's exclusive rights under the Road Concession \u2013 a characterization which the Respondent denies. The Parties also dispute what was agreed between them with respect to the type of road(s) to be built, how this relates to the broader NSRC project, and how the Road Project was to be financed. The facts underlying these disputes are briefly outlined below.\n\n***a. Exclusivity and the NSRC project***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nOn the Claimants' case, the Respondent's parallel campaign to develop a competing southern road had begun already in November 2012, when Armenia requested additional financing from the ADB.145 As discussed above, the ADB had agreed in 2009 to provide a multi-tranche financing facility for various NSRC projects.146 On 22 November 2012, Armenia submitted a periodic financing request to the ADB,147 for which the ADB approved certain financing in an \"Advance Contracting Notice\" issued on 16 January 2013. The financing approved in this notice was for roadwork on Tranche 3 of the NSRC, but also to enable Armenia to \"undertake feasibility and detailed design of Tranche 4,\" the southernmost portion of the NSRC.148 On 18 June 2013, Armenia notified the ADB that it would require less funding from the ADB than previously discussed, because it had successfully obtained alternative financing from the European Investment Bank for part of the Tranche 3 work. However, Armenia stated that:\n\nas part of preparing the Tranche 4 of the ADB [Multilateral Financing Facility], we intend to request the ADB to take over the construction of approximately 55-60km of Category 1 road from Artashat to the southern direction \u2026. Meantime, by doing the feasibility study of the whole of the southern part of the North South Road, we increase the chances for the Government to attract additional co-financing, or parallel financing, from such potentially interested lending agencies as the Eurasian Development Bank (EBD), JICA, etc.149\n\nCl.

Mr. Borkowski and Mr. Tappendorf say that they first learned about Armenia's funding request when they met with ADB themselves on 12 July 2013.151\n\nFirst Borkowski Statement \u00b6 48; Cl.

Mr. Grigoryan does not agree with this version of events, and says that no attempts were made to hide from Rasia the Government's work with the ADB.152\n\nFirst Borkowski Statement \u00b6 53; Second Borkowski Statement \u00b6 85; Grigoryan Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 25-28; Resp.

The request for ADB financing was triggered by the completion of preparatory works on Tranche 3, a different part of the NSRC, to which the \"overwhelming majority\" of the funds related, the Respondent says. The references to Tranche 4 are explained by the fact that Tranche 4 of the NSRC is longer than the Concession Territory,153 and a small part of the work for which Armenia also sought financing covered a part of Tranche 4 which did not overlap with Rasia's rights. In any event, the Respondent observes, it is undisputed that the ADB loan agreement was not signed until 11 March 2014, by which time (on the Respondent's version of events), Rasia already had defaulted on its Road Project obligations.154\n\nResp.

Type(s) of road(s) and the financing thereof***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nAs explained at paragraph 118 above, Section 3 of the Road Concession defined as the Road \"Project\" work on two separate roads. Rasia was \"to implement from its own funds and attracted Project Financing\" the design and build of a new \"high speed road\" (Section 3(b)) and was also \"to rehabilitate and hand over to the Government the existing toll free road between Sisian and Meghri \u2026 within the budget of USD 80 millions\" (Section 3(e)).155\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 3; *see also Id.*, Section 1 (defining \"Project\" as having \"the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 3\").\n\n194.\n\nIt is undisputed that instead of the two roads contemplated by the Road Concession, Rasia proposed a single road project, financed by so-called \"availability payments\" from the Government instead of any tolls, on the basis that traffic volumes would be too low to sustain a toll road as a commercial undertaking. However, the Parties are in dispute as to the timing and implications of these developments, in particular, with respect to what was to be built instead of the toll road and how it was to be financed.\n\n195.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Parties agreed to a one-road solution in November 2012, during the CCCC site visit to Armenia, a contention which the Respondent disputes.156 The Claimants observe that the map contained in the site visit report reflects only one road.157 The Claimants also contend that the Road Terms of Reference, signed on 10 November 2012, also consistently refer to a single road.158 At the same time, the Respondent notes, Article 2 of the Road Terms of Reference describes the Road Project \"[a]s defined in Section 3 [\u2026] of the [Road Concession],\" which, as recounted above, provided for two roads.159\n\nCl.

Based on the availability payments, it is anticipated that the Project should be able to secure loans from the Export-Import Bank of China or China Development Bank for approximately 60-85% of the Project investment requirement \u2026. The remaining 15-40% of the funds are anticipated to be loans from an active international financial institution in Armenia with a history of financing or interest in financing the North-South Road Corridor program. It is not anticipated that equity investment will be required for the Project financing other than the equity invested for the feasibility study and other related works leading up to completion of the Project financing.162\n\nFebruary Tr., Day 4, Hanessian/Borkowski, 590:23-591:7.\n\nC-118, Letter from Mr. J.

According to Mr. Borkowski, Minister Beglaryan raised the subject at a separate meeting in his private office on 17 February 2014, which was also attended by Mr. Grigoryan acting as English-Armenian translator. During this meeting, Minister Beglaryan allegedly insisted that Mr. Borkowski drop the Road Project, and threatened that Rasia would also lose the Railway Project if Mr. Borkowski persisted with pursuing the Road Project. According to Mr. Borkowski, Mr. Grigoryan then said that \"the Minister wants to know what's under the paper,\" and further explained that \"he wants to know what's in it for him.\"182 Both Mr. Arakelyan (who Mr. Borkowski says \"with 100% certainty\" did not attend the meeting in question183) and Mr. Grigoryan have denied Mr. Borkowski's account. Mr. Arakelyan says that no discussion of the kind Mr. Borkowski describes took place, while Mr. Grigoryan, who denies having been present at the alleged meeting, says there was \"absolutely nothing,\" either during the February 2014 Yerevan Meetings or afterwards, that would support Mr. Borkowski's allegations in this respect.184\n\nSecond Borkowski Statement \u00b6\u00b6 18, 66-80.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 76.\n\nFirst Arakelyan Statement \u00b6 54; Second Arakelyan Statement \u00b6 71; Grigoryan Statement \u00b6\u00b6 12, 31-32.\n\n207.\n\nTwo days after the alleged bribery request, Mr. Borkowski reported to Mr. Tappendorf about the February 2014 Yerevan Meetings.

He did so, because he says that he had been told at those Meetings that Rasia might be able to participate in the broader ADB-financed NSRC road program, involving a Category 1 road (which the Respondent denies).187 In a 20 February 2014 email to Mr. David Dole of the ADB, Mr. Borkowski submitted what he described as a \"request for approval from [ADB] to continue our activities.\"188 The attached letter stated as follows:\n\nFollowing our presentation of the Southern Armenia Railway, the Prime Minister requested that Rasia and CCCC contact [ADB] to seek [ADB] approval in order to participate in the North South Road Corridor program.\n\nPursuant to this instruction, we are pleased to submit our formal request for Rasia and CCCC, together and individually, to continue existing works on the Southern Armenia High Speed Road project as well as to consider additional new works regarding feasibility, design, financing and construction proposals between CCCC, the China Banks such as China Export Import Bank and China Development Bank, and the Government of the Republic of Armenia potentially extending from Ararat to Agarak. In all cases, we aim to coordinate closely with [ADB] and request your approval by letter to the Minister of Transport and Communication, Mr. Gagik Beglaryan, to work directly with the Government of the Republic of Armenia.\n\nKindly advise of any questions or required clarifications to this letter and we hope to secure your approval/consent to continue our road related works soon.189\n\nSecond Borkowski Statement \u00b6 95; February Tr.

Borkowski to Mr. B. Weixin, 3 March 2014.\n\n210.\n\nOn 18 March 2014, however, ADB responded without making any commitments. The transmittal email to Mr. Borkowski said the ADB was \"requesting the govt's advice on how they would like us to work with Rasia\u2026. [w]e are kicking this back to the govt.\"191 The attached ADB letter stated that while ADB \"is interested in cooperating with all potential partners on Armenia's North-South Road Corridor Investment Program, and is glad to hear of Rasia's interest in the southern sections of the North-South road \u2026 [a]ll work on the North-South road, involving ADB or others \u2026 is coordinated by\" the Armenian Ministry of Transport. ADB instructed Rasia to \"coordinate directly\" with Armenian officials \"to discuss Rasia's interest in financing the North-South road \u2026.\"192\n\nR-90, Email from Mr. D. Dole to Mr. J.

Weixin to Mr. J. Borkowski, 26 March 2014.\n\n212.\n\nThe next day, on 20 March 2014, Mr. Borkowski sent a letter to Minister Beglaryan, in which he professed to have \"received a positive response letter\" from ADB regarding \"mutual cooperation with the Government of the Republic of Armenia for the North-South Road including [the Road Project].\" The letter also attached the same draft CCCC MoU Mr. Borkowski allegedly raised with Armenia at the February 2014 Yerevan Meetings, pursuant to which Armenia and CCCC would seek to integrate the proposed road into the NSRC initiative and begin negotiating Chinese financing. Mr. Borkowski proposed in his letter to Minister Beglaryan that \"CCCC and Rasia FZE, at our own cost, [\u2026] modify the existing feasibility study and the recommended alignment of the road project to the standards of the North-South Road Corridor.\"194\n\nR-19, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 20 March 2014 (attaching Letter from Mr. D. Dole to Mr. J.

Grigoryan, 21 March 2014 (attaching Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan).\n\n213.\n\nSeveral days later, on 24 March 2014, Mr. Borkowski reported to ADB that in a meeting with Mr. Grigorian of the Ministry of Transport, he was told that \"the Armenian government has agreed to borrow funds from ADB that also covers a feasibility study from Arthashat to Kajaran.\" Mr. Borkowski queried why \"the government is paying for another FS when we have already paid CCCC\" for one. Nonetheless, he said, \"[w]e are waiting to modify our FS from the road directorate technical input/standards to the NSRC technical standards.\"195 The next day, ADB confirmed that it \"has about $170 million left to lend for the NS road, and will prefer to continue from Artashat to however far south we can\" with that sum, but it required instructions from the Government regarding Rasia's participation. ADB did report \"good news for you,\" which was that \"[t]he final version of the govt's development strategy mentions your railway and road projects.\" Mr. Borkowski welcomed the news and stated that \"[h]opefully I can sort out the road matter and CCCC can continue their work.\"196\n\nR-88, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. D. Dole, 26 March 2014, p. 3.\n\nR-88, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. D. Dole, 26 March 2014, pp. 2-3.\n\n214.\n\nMr. Borkowski's optimism was misplaced, however. One week later, on 1 April 2014, Mr. Beglaryan informed the ADB that the Road Feasibility Study submitted by Rasia \"is inefficient and does not comply with the overall strategy, and therefore it cannot be considered\" within the broader NRSC project. Specifically, he complained as follows:\n\n[I]n the feasibility study represented by Rasia is proposed a reconstruction of the existing road option by providing Category II road where the design speed is 60 km/h and 40 km/h and the carriageway is 2 lanes as well as is intended horizontal curves with small radius and large longitudinal slopes. Taking into account the main conditions of North-South road corridor now feasibility study is being carried out for about 5 alternatives, where approval is expected to be given to the construction of the Category I road where the speed will be mostly 80km/h and carriageway will be 4 lanes, as well as the new road construction will give an opportunity to shorten the existing about 50km road section. At the same time for intending carriageway with 2 lanes for upstream and downstream it's necessary to have additional lanes for traffic, otherwise problems may arise in the presence of large trucks. On the Qajaran to Agarak section \u2026 [i]t should also be noted that the radiuses of horizonal curves, longitudinal slopes and other technical parameters are more secure and creates favorable conditions for traffic.\n\nMr. Beglaryan added, however, that while Rasia's Road Feasibility Study could not be considered within the NSRC project, \"Rasia, if [it wishes], can be involved into the implementation\" of any road construction resulting from alternative feasibility studies developed by the ADB in future.197\n\nC-294, Letter from Minister G. Beglaryan to Mr. D. Dole, 1 April 2014.\n\n215.\n\nOn 4 April 2014, Mr. Dole of the ADB informed Mr. Borkowski that he believed the Government did not understand that \"the govt and any financier can do a separate deal themselves and ADB does not have to be involved\" in all financing for the North-South road. Mr. Borkowski agreed that \"in my discussions with the [Ministry of Transport], the key aspect the[y] have not been understanding is the 'separate deal' part.\"198 Mr. Borkowski had tried to explain to the Government that Rasia wished to continue \"with our project,\" and to work with ADB on co-financing \"only where we meet the necessary standards/requirements, but we also want to be able to explore all financing alternatives (Exim, China Development Bank, etc) that may also not involve ADB in the financing .\u2026 I think they are learning as things go but they seem to have good intentions.\" ADB replied that \"[o]ne part of the govt's argument makes sense \u2013 they want to follow one set of rules for the whole road.\"199\n\nR-90, Email from Mr. D. Dole to Mr. J. Borkowski, 4 April 2014, p. 2.\n\nR-90, Email from Mr. D. Dole to Mr. J. Borkowski, 4 April 2014, p. 1.\n\n216.\n\nRoughly five weeks later, on 12 May 2014, Mr. Borkowski sent a follow-up email to Mr. Grigoryan at the Ministry of Transport. He stated that \"CCCC \u2026 asked about the road project and would love to be able to sign the MoU,\" so that Rasia could \"get the Chinese banks working with the Minister of Finance on very special loan packages.\"200 It is undisputed that Armenia never signed a Memorandum of Understanding with CCCC.201\n\nR-97, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Staff of the Ministry of Transport, 12 May 2014.\n\nFebruary Tr., Day 8, McNeill/Grigoryan, 1440:16-19.\n\n217.\n\nOn 23 May 2014, Armenia requested a US$150 million loan from the EDB.202 The EDB approved the loan on 2 July 2014,203 and the final loan agreement was executed on or about 14 April 2015.204 The Claimants argue that the road stretch for which the loan was sought overlaps with the exclusive territory in the Road Concession, a contention which the Respondent disputes.205 The Claimants also argue that while the formal request for the EDB loan took place in May 2014, Armenia took several earlier steps, beginning with a preliminary application in December 2012, to seek this financing.206 According to the Respondent, the precise section of the road for which the government sought EDB construction financing had not been defined in December 2012. In any event, the Respondent says, first, that the stretch for which it sought EDB financing did not overlap with the road envisioned by the Road Concession, and, second, the loan agreement with EDB was not executed until 14 April 2015,207 long after Rasia had defaulted on the Road Project (and over a year after the ADB loan discussed above).208\n\nC-139, \"Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Development Website: \"Armenian Ministry of Finance Applies to EDB for New Investment Finance From the ACF,\" https://efsd.eabr.org/en/press-center/news/armbanks-am-armenian-ministry-of-finance-applies-to-edb-for-new-investment-finance-from-the-acf/, 29 May 2014; C-140, Eurasian Development Bank \u2013 Resources Manager of EurAsEC Anti-Crisis Fund, \"Appraisal of Application of Republic of Armenia for Investment Loan to be provided by the EurAsEC Anti- Crisis Fund for the project 'Construction of the North-South Road Corridor (Phase 4)' in the amount of US$ 150 million,\" June 2014;\n\nC-128, Eurasian Development Bank, \"Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Development \u2013 Annual Report 2014,\" 2014, p. 16.\n\nC-297, Agreement on an Investment Loan Extended Using the Funds of the Anti-crisis Fund of the Eurasian Economic Community to Finance the Project Titled Construction of the North-South Road Corridor (4th Stage) between Armenia and EDB, April 2015.\n\nCl.

The letter noted, for example, that Rasia had submitted a Road Feasibility Study which provided for \"reconstruction of the existing road option by providing Category II road where the design speed is 60 km/h and 40km/h and carriageway is 2 lanes as well as is intended horizontal curves with small radius and large longitudinal slopes.\" This proposal was contrasted with the \"main conditions\" of the NSRC feasibility study now being carried out with ADB assistance, \"where approval is expected to be given to the construction of the Category I road where \"the speed will be mostly 80km/h and carriageway will be 4 lanes,\" with \"radiuses of horizontal curves, longitudinal slopes and other technical parameters [that] are more secure and create[] favorable conditions for traffic.\" Mr. Arakelyan invited Rasia to be involved in the future \"implementation of the Project,\" subject to ADB approval.209\n\nR-26, Letter from Mr. A. Arakelyan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 16 June 2014.\n\n219.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether the Road Concession was ever effectively terminated. While the Respondent has suggested that the Concession was orally terminated at the February 2014 Yerevan Meetings, it has conceded that the formal termination was delayed.210 The Ministry of Transport prepared a draft decision authorizing Minister Beglaryan to rescind the Road Concession. It was submitted to the Ministry of Justice for legal review, and on 5 December 2014 also submitted to the Chief of the Staff of the Government for consideration.211 However, the formal termination decision was not sent to Rasia \"solely for bureaucratic reasons,\" the Respondent says.212 Instead, Mr. Borkowski says, he was informed by Mr. Grigoryan in a phone call \"on or around 29 December 2014\" of the Government's decision to terminate the Road Concession.213\n\nResp.

Specifically, the Claimants say that Armenia signed an MoU on Tranche 4 of the NSRC with China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation Ltd. (\"**CCECC**\") on 23 December 2014. This alleged MoU (the \"**Alleged CCECC MoU**\") has not been produced as evidence in this Arbitration, but the Claimants contend that its existence is evident from a briefing prepared for the Armenian President, before his visit to China in March 2015.216 The Respondent says this reflects a mistake in making reference to a December 2014 MoU.217 An MoU undisputedly was signed on 31 January 2015 between the Armenian Ministry of Transport and the CCECC, but this was for the design and construction of just a 22 kilometer road section south of Kajaran, including a 4.7 km tunnel, and not any broader stretch of Tranche 4 (the \"**CCECC MoU**\").218\n\nC-306, Presentation, \"Construction of the Southern Railway Passing through Armenia's Section of the Silk Road,\" 2015, p. 7 (stating that \"[o]n 23 December 2014 the Minister of Transport and Communication of the RA signed a Memorandum on Tranche 4 of the North-South highway\" with CCECC).\n\nResp.

The resulting site visit report has not been produced as evidence in this Arbitration, but the Claimants again contend that the site visit is evident from the same March 2015 briefing prepared for the Armenian President.

It appears undisputed that the Armenian Government did not provide written comments to Rasia on the Railway Feasibility Study. The Respondent argues (as discussed further herein) that, pursuant to Sections 20.2-20.3 of the Railway Concession, this means that the Railway Feasibility Study was deemed to have been \"finally accepted\" on 30 January 2014, thirty days from the date of the Government's receipt,228 with the result that the time periods for Rasia's obligations under the Railway Concession with respect to further phases of the Project began running from then.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 20; Resp. First PHB \u00b6 74.\n\n227.\n\nNotwithstanding the absence of written comments provided to Rasia, the Railway Feasibility Study was the subject of study and discussion within the Armenian Government. On 17 February 2014, the governmental Working Group sent a summary of its recommendations to the Ministry of Transport. One recurring concern mentioned by several ministries was that the project cost calculated at $3.2 billion did not include the acquisition cost of lands required for construction. Working Group members also wished to learn more about the projected loan terms for the 60% of the project that was to be debt financed, and about the \"procurement sources\" of the other 40% of the project cost.229 In this regard, the Railway Feasibility Study had stated only as follows:\n\nThe Project allows for loans from the Export-Import Bank of China (interim) of at least 60% with a bank loan APR of 3.5% as well as self-raised funds of 40% with the participation of regional governments benefiting substantially from the development of the Project.230\n\nC-279, Letter from A.

The Government's confirmation of the corridor would in turn constitute its recognition of \"the exclusive prevailing public interest in respect of the lands and immovables in the Corridor,\" and would trigger its duty to acquire the Corridor these lands and immovables \"within a reasonably short period,\" so as not to delay the start of construction.238\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 9(e), (f); Section 21; Section 22.1.\n\n234.\n\nRespondent claims that in early April 2014, Mr. Grigoryan wrote to Rasia noting that the company had not provided sufficiently detailed information regarding the corridor to allow the Government to begin taking the steps required for it to acquire all lands and immovables in the Corridor, as required by the Railway Concession.239 While this particular communication does not appear to be in the record, it does seem clear from other correspondence that the Government raised the issue of detailed coordinates with Rasia in early April 2014. On 13 April 2014, Mr. Borkowski asked Mr. Weixin of CCCC for \"[a]ny news on the \u2026 railway GPS or other coordinates,\" advising him that \"[w]e need responses as quickly as possible to avoid dragging this project timeline out.\"240 Mr. Weixin responded on 14 April 2014 that \"absolute coordinates,\" as opposed to the \"relative coordinates\" already in place, would be necessary for further design work for the Railway Project,\" a response that Mr. Borkowski interpreted as meaning that the more detailed coordinates could not be provided until the engineering stage.241\n\nResp.

Specifically, \"[r]egarding your request for coordinates,\" he attached the coordinates he had, but advised that \"[a]s is standard in railway engineering design and construction, these coordinates are considered relative (versus absolute) at this stage since they may be varied as the route scheme is optimized ... during the design and construction stage.\" Mr. Borkowski added that \"the variation may be controlled in a few hundred meters in either direction,\" and suggested that \"[t]his process is iterative and becomes more specific as the project progresses.\" Mr. Borkowski requested the Government proceed to provide its decrees approving the Railway Feasibility Study and the \"macro alignment adoption\" for the railway corridor.242\n\nR-20, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. A. Arakelyan and Mr. G. Grigoryan, 21 April 2014.\n\n236.\n\nMr. Grigoryan responded on 30 April 2014 that the coordinate data Rasia had supplied \"cannot be processed by the State Committee of the Real Estate Cadastre,\" which required submission of information in the \"WGS-84 coordinates system,\" for it to identify \"all the necessary data on the adjacent area to the alignment.\" On 5 May 2014, Mr. Grigoryan wrote again to Mr. Borkowski, expressing concern that \"the coordinates already provided might not be correct as the unofficial viewing showed deviations varying from a few meters to several kilometers.\" Given these significant discrepancies, he again requested submission of coordinates in \"the WGS-84 coordinates system,\" and expressed the hope that \"they will be completely correct.\"243 Mr. Borkowski replied the same day, repasting his 21 April 2014 response and insisting that only \"relative coordinates\" could be provided at this point, and that \"[t]he government must adopt the FS and macro alignment for us to move forward \u2026. [T]he government should not begin allocating land now.\" He also emphasized that \"we should make amendments to the concession agreement based on the actual developments we experience together over time which can never match the anticipated steps in the concession agreement.\"244\n\nR-22, Email from Mr. G.

Mr. Borkowski proposed that once the Government had \"confirm[ed] the feasibility study and macro alignment\" based on the information provided, \"we can simultaneously agree to various concession agreement modifications including that the land assemblage will take place later following the start of the EPC works.\"245\n\nR-24, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 23 May 2014.\n\n238.\n\nOn 31 May 2014, Mr. Borkowski contacted his ADB correspondent, Mr. Dole (with whom Rasia was already in touch about the Road Project), to suggest that ADB might be able to assist Armenia with \"the financial support (i.e. soft loans) and expertise to fulfill the GoA obligations related to the \u2026 railway (such as identifying the exact parcels of land most suitable for the project, assisting with the land assemblage, and developing social and environmental analyses not currently required under the concession agreements).\"246 Mr. Borkowski expressed concern that \"[a]t the moment, the GoA \u2026 wants me to tell them the exact parcels of land required for the project now so that they can assemble and transfer them to the project; something that CCCC and I communicated would not be necessary until post engineering survey and pre-construction rather than now.\"247\n\nR-99, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. D. Dole, 31 May 2014. At the Hearing, Mr. Borkowski admitted that the latter part of this statement was incorrect; the Railway Concession had made Rasia responsible for social and environmental analyses. *See* February Tr.

Dole, 31 May 2014.\n\n239.\n\nOn 16 July 2014 the Chairman of Armenia's State Committee of the Real Estate Cadastre informed Mr. Beglaryan that the Cadastre could not agree to the proposed draft Government decision approving the \"initial right-of-way of construction\" of the Railway Project. The Cadastre advised that once it received appropriate \"measurement data,\" it would be possible for the Cadastre to provide information on \"the surfaces, designated purpose and ownership entities of the land parcels located on the adjacent territories of the right of way.\"248\n\nR-106, Letter from M. Sarsyan to Minister G. Beglaryan, 16 July 2014.\n\n240.\n\nRasia maintains that it formally accepted the Railway Feasibility Study in a letter to Minister Beglaryan several days later, on 20 July 2014. That letter stated that \"[b]y this Notice, \u2026 we finally accept\" the study, and \"look forward to receiving the government decrees \u2026 that will officially adopt both the \u2026 feasibility study as well as the recommended railway alignment so that we may begin our Project Financing period.\"249 As noted in para. 226 above, the Respondent maintains, by contrast, that Rasia should be deemed to have accepted the Railway Feasibility Study automatically almost six months earlier, on 30 January 2014, through application of Section 20 of the Railway Concession.250\n\nC-141, Letter from Mr. J.

This Protocol accommodated Rasia by replicating its proposed language approving the \"preliminary alignment\" of the Railway, but it went on to make clear that the Government intended to act with dispatch in performing its side of the Concession Agreement's terms on land assemblage. In particular, the 7 August 2014 Protocol instructed the Cadastre to provide information on the purpose and value of lands that would be impacted by the Railway, two months after receiving the coordinate measurement date from Rasia, and within a few months thereafter, the Government was to consider any proposed changes to the preliminary alignment and prepare a list of actions needed to move forward to a final alignment and land acquisition mechanisms.251\n\nC-288, Protocol Decree 33/-26 on Approving the Preliminary Alignment and the Feasibility Study of the Southern Armenia Railway Construction (Unofficial English Translation and Armenian Original), 7 August 2014.\n\n242.\n\nThe following day, 8 August 2014, Mr. Borkowski requested the Government to issue a formal notice approving the Railway Feasibility Study and the preliminary alignment, based on the understanding that detailed coordinates would be provided later. He stated that he needed this document to move to the next stage on financing arrangements,252 even though he had previously written that the Concession Agreements provide for \"automatic adoption\" of Feasibility Studies, in the absence of Government comment.253\n\nR-27, Email from Mr. J.

It stated as follows: \"[t]he preliminary alignment \u2026 has also been approved \u2026. Rasia may now proceed to the Project Financing Period under the [Railway Concession] while also determining the final detailed coordinates for the recommended alignment of the Southern Railway.\"255\n\nR-27, Email from Mr. J.

Borkowski, 19 August 2014.\n\n244.\n\nThe issue of coordinates was not resolved by these communications. Before addressing disputes that subsequently arose, the Tribunal summarizes below a separate issue connected to the Railway Project, involving uncertainties about railway connections at the Iranian border and the relationship between such connections and the availability of potential project financing.\n\n***b. The Iranian connections***\n--------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nAs discussed above, the existing railway network in Armenia did not extend south to the Iranian border. Nor, for that matter, did the existing Iranian railway network extend north to the Armenian border. For the two networks to connect, new track would have to be laid on both sides of the border. Armenia and Iran had discussed the need for improved transport connectivity between the two countries for several years prior to the initiation of the Railway Project.256\n\nArakelyan Statement \u00b6 34; Resp. Counter-Mem., \u00b6 112.\n\n246.\n\nThe establishment of a connection to the Iranian railway system was a critical factor for the feasibility of the Railway Project, since the Project was expected eventually to generate revenue from freight traffic, and more than half of the eventual traffic projected by the Railway Feasibility Study consisted of oil shipments to the Black Sea.257 Mr. Borkowski himself was acutely aware of the importance of the Iranian connection. A year before he delivered the Railway Feasibility Study to Armenia,258 Mr. Borkowski advised Minister Beglaryan that CCCC and the China Development Bank had \"requested with great emphasis to demonstrate strong regional cooperation with Russia and Iran regarding the railway development by signing a tripartite memoranda of understanding.\" With respect to Iran, Mr. Borkowski emphasized that in order \"to successfully develop the railway, it is mandatory \u2026 that Rasia has an initial commitment from \u2026 Iranian party regarding the 60 km railway development on its territory \u2026.\"259\n\nC-116, Railway Feasibility Study, p. 29.\n\nC-127, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 31 December 2013 (delivering Armenian language version of Railway Feasibility Study).\n\nC-101, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan (Unofficial Translation and Armenian Original), 21 December 2012, p. 6.\n\n247.\n\nOn 19 April 2013, Mr. Borkowski wrote to Minister Beglaryan, again highlighting the need for Iranian cooperation:\n\nOur work on the feasibility studies requires the immediate technical cooperation of the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (IRI Railways). We kindly ask the Ministry of Transport and Communication to send a letter to IRI Railways requesting a technical team meeting with CCCC and Rasia in Beijing, Yerevan or Teheran.\n\nWe also need to sign the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Iran to demonstrate the important political support and cooperation with Iran for the project.260\n\nJB-3, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Ministry of Transport, 19 April 2013.\n\n248.\n\nThe viability of an Iranian extension of the Railway was threatened by the fact that another cross-border railway link was already under construction in Azerbaijan, with Iranian support, constituting a competitive threat to Rasia's Railway Project. Mr. Borkowski identified this threat as an \"exceptionally important matter\" in a letter to Minister Beglaryan on 27 November 2013, expressing concern that \"[t]he Azeri railway would ruin the South Armenia Railway as a private project and only the Armenian government will be able to develop it if the Azeri's [sic] develop their project.\" Mr. Borkowski added:\n\nWe must secure the previously desired exclusivity/monopoly from Iran for the north-south railway through Armenia for 20-30 years. Only Russian leadership (Putin or Yakunin) can persuade Iran not to build the Qazvin-Astara link [through Azerbaijan]. I see that President Putin is coming to Armenia on December 2nd. It is absolutely essential for the Southern Armenia Railway that President Sargsyan request that President Putin and/or Vladimir Yakunin give a clear and public political signal to Iran that the north-south railway must be built through Armenia and not Azerbaijan [\u2026]261\n\nR-9, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 27 November 2013.\n\n249.\n\nIn a separate letter two days later, Mr. Borkowski re-emphasized the importance of having President Sargsyan try to persuade Russia to signal to Iran that the link be built through Armenia and not Azerbaijan, because \"the north-south railway through Azerbaijan would ruin the feasibility of the Southern Railway as a private project. The Southern Armenia Railway requires up to 30 years of exclusivity from Iran for the north-south transport traffic through Armenia and therefore no development of the [Azerbaijan] link.\"262 President Sargsyan did meet with Russia's President Putin on 2 December 2013, during which plans to \"build a [rail] transport link-up through Iran\" were discussed.263 However, Iran ultimately did not agree to abandon the Azerbaijan link, which remained a threat to the feasibility of the Railway Project.\n\nR-10, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 29 November 2013, p. 2.\n\nR-78, The President of the Republic of Armenia, Press conference of President Serzh Sargsyan and President Vladimir Putin on the results of the meeting, https://www.president.am/en/interviews-andpress-conferences/item/2013/12/02/President-Serzh-Sargsyan-pressconference-with-the-President-of-Russian-Federation/, 2 December 2013.\n\n250.\n\nThe issue of Azerbaijan continued to worry Mr. Borkowski, who asked Mr. Grigoryan on 23 January 2014 to try persuade Iran \u2013 in the context of an Iran-Armenia-Rasia trilateral memorandum of understanding that was then under discussion \u2013 \"to include the same No Grant provision (monopoly rights) to the Iran section as in the Armenia concession to Rasia.\" Mr. Borkowski explained that this was important \"considering that Iran's construction of an alternative competing railway to Astera will cause the Iran-Armenia railway to be unable to attract financing and fail.\"264 On 27 April 2014, Mr. Borkowski bemoaned an \"announcement from the Iran president regarding railway communication with Georgia through Azerbaijan,\" stating that \"[I]ran is not helping our project with these types of pro-Azeri announcements.\"265\n\nR-12, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 23 January 2014.\n\nR-21, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 30 April 2014.\n\n251.\n\nThe connection between a viable Iranian railway link and Rasia's ability to obtain outside financing for the Railway Project within Armenia was clear from the beginning. Mr. Borkowski candidly admitted during the Hearing that without the link to an Iranian rail segment to enable cross-border freight traffic, the proposed Armenian track sections would become a proverbial \"railway to nowhere.\"266 This was consistent with Mr. Borkowski's contemporaneous statements to the Ministry of Transport, such as his statement in February 2014 that there was a \"[t]erminal risk to Project from Iran railway section\" (either because of \"no construction or competing construction to Astara\"),267 and his October 2014 that \"the Iran cooperation is absolutely critical for any further progress to be made.\"268\n\nFebruary Tr.

Arakelyan, 13 October 2014.\n\n252.\n\nYet just as Iran proved unwilling to forswear a potential future railway link through Azerbaijan, it also proved unwilling to commit to construction of a railway segment connecting to Armenia, until there first was meaningful progress in constructing the corresponding Armenian sections. Mr. Borkowski had predicted just such a problem in late May 2014, when he expressed concern to the ADB that \"I believe Iran will only undertake to construct its 80km railway link \u2026 when it sees construction activities on the Armenia side of the border.\"269 His instinct proved correct: this predicate condition was expressly reflected in the final Memorandum of Understanding that Iran, Armenia and Rasia signed on 10 November 2014 (the \"**Iranian Trilateral MoU**\"), in which Iran \"expressed its readiness to undertake construction of \u2026 Iran segment of the railways when [the Railway Project] progress by value achieves 30% in the Republic of Armenia territory.\"270\n\nR-99, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. D. Dole, 31 May 2014, p. 3. In the same letter to the ADB, Mr. Borkowski expressed a hope that Armenia \"should borrow from ADB and make a controlled equity investment\" into the Railway Project, because \"[a] unified project, ADB involvement, and Armenia government direct ownership are the critical aspects to getting this north-south railway project up to the EPC/construction phase.\" *Id.* Mr. Borkowski admitted at the Hearing that this was a new idea \u2013 that Armenia should participate directly in the financing of the Railway Project, even though it was not required to do so under the Concession Agreements. He also insisted that by this time, he was confident that he already had sufficient financing support for the Railway Project, consisting of 60% China EximBank financing (referenced in the Railway Feasibility Study) and a deal in principle with Aabar to supply the additional 40%. *See* February Tr. Day 3, Borowski, 542:3-6; 545:23-546:7.\n\nC-12, Unofficial Trilateral Memorandum of Understanding Between the Holding Company for Construction and Development of Transport Infrastructures of the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Ministry of Transport, and Rasia, 10 November 2014, Article 3.\n\n253.\n\nMr. Borkowski sought to persuade Iran to consider a private funding model for a future Iranian segment of the railway. Iran alluded in the Iranian Trilateral MoU to the possibility that \"[i]n its sole discretion, [it] could choose Rasia as an alternative \u2026 in the form of finance, build, lease and transfer,\" but made no commitments in that regard.271\n\n*Id.*, Article 4.\n\n254.\n\nNonetheless, soon after the Iranian Trilateral MoU, Mr. Borkowski began to focus on efforts to obtain outside financing for possible EPC work on the Iranian side. On 24 November 2014, he approached China Poly Group (\"**China Poly**\"), a Chinese firm with which Mr. Borkowski had previous connections, explaining that \"[t]he objective is to bring Poly into the project exclusively on the Iranian side,\" in the first instance to prepare a \"bankable feasibility study and designs for the Iran section.\" He explained that Iran might be willing to provide \"various sovereign and resource guarantees and payments\" to support the eventual railway construction, whereas \"Armenia is too poor to provide a sovereign guaranty or payments\" for the work on its side of the border. Nonetheless, Mr. Borkowski referred to the possibility of future amendments to the Railway Concession with Armenia, \"such that the project involves a government guaranteed lease payment to service debt and pay a profit\" to outside financers.272\n\nR-118, Email from Zhaodi to Mr. J. Borkowski, 21 January 2015, pp. 10-11.\n\n255.\n\nFurther correspondence followed in December 2014, with China Poly expressing preliminary interest \"if the Iran side can provide a proper guarantee\" and a solution to current sanctions issues could be found.273 China Poly continued to ask various questions, to which Mr. Borkowski provided answers in January 2015. Among his statements to China Poly was the boast that \"Rasia can ensure Poly gets exclusivity [on the Iranian side] because Rasia is the concessionaire on the Armenia side and controlling the entire Armenia-Iran railway cooperation between the Armenia and Iran governments.\" He acknowledged the challenge that \"[t]he Iran government wants to see the Armenia side constructed at the same time,\" but stated that \"it is our decision to determine the best way by the completion of the FS and preliminary design works.\"274\n\n*Id.*, p. 9.\n\nR-118, Email from Zhaodi to Mr. J. Borkowski, 21 January 2015, pp. 6-8.\n\n256.\n\nIn January and February 2015, Mr. Borkowski continued to engage with China Poly and to seek possible support from Iranian government agencies for Rasia and China Poly involvement on the Iranian segment of the railway. One such agency, Iran's Construction and Development of Transportation Infrastructures Company (CDTIC), cautioned that \"[a]ll of our projects have the government and Central Bank of Iran guarantees.\"275\n\nR-122, Email from Zhaodi to Mr. J. Borkowski, 2 February 2015, p. 3.\n\n257.\n\nIn July 2015, Mr. Borkowski arranged for China Poly representatives to meet with officials in Tehran.276 On 10 August 2015, China Poly told Mr. Borkowski that Iranian officials \"are very concerned about the feasibility of railway in Armenia,\" and had \"made it clear that 30% of the railway or investment in Armenia has to be done to activate the project in Iran. \u2026 The question is how the Armenia side would like to finance their project \u2026.\" China Poly's inquiry about Armenian financing of the Railway Project is curious, given that Mr. Borkowski had already informed China Poly some eight months previously that \"Armenia is too poor to provide a sovereign guaranty \u2026.\"277 In any event China Poly further reported that it had asked Iranian officials if Iran might provide a guarantee for the Armenian railway, to which Iranian officials responded that any such request would have to come officially from the Armenian government. China Poly made no commitment of its own in this communication.278 Following another meeting in September 2015 (which Mr. Thornber of Aabar apparently attended), Rasia promised to send China Poly a \"draft non-binding framework agreement giving Poly exclusivity and conditional on conversion of the Rasia agreements into G2G cooperation in Iran and Armenia.\"279\n\nR-128, Email from D.

Iran also offered a Government guarantee for the Project in Armenia provided the request was made through official Armenian channels.\n\nBased on these efforts, which render the Railway and Armenia's participation in the International North-South Transportation Corridor feasible, Rasia secured further interest from China Poly Group to contribute and arrange financing to cover the full cost of the Southern Armenia at even more attractive rates.280\n\nC-35, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Prime Minister H. Abrahamyan (attaching letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G.

According to the after-action mission report he prepared, Mr. Beglaryan stated that Iranian and Russian \"investments \u2026 into implementation of the project would be justified and would be in the interest of all,\" and the Iranian Minister of Roads and Urban Development \"offered to select an independent consulting company to conduct \u2026 feasibility studies of the railway project,\" stating that \"with guarantees from the Government \u2026 of Armenia, Iran can assist in securing funds from international organizations. Mr. Beglaryan clarified that a feasibility study already had been conducted \"by a Chinese company.\"281 In a separate meeting with the First Vice President of the Islamic Republic, Mr. Beglaryan congratulated Iran on the lifting of international sanctions and said that with respect to \"joint transport projects\" between the two countries, \"Armenia wanted to use the capacity of the Iranian companies and contractors for project implementation since they had extensive experience in implementing such projects.\"282 During the visit, the delegations signed a memorandum of understanding on the \"Unification of the Railway Systems of the Two Countries.\"283\n\nC-308, \"Mission report on the results of the delegation visit headed by the Minister of Transport and Communication of the Republic of Armenia\" submitted by Minister G.

The minutes of the technical meeting also stated that \"in addition to assessing and investigating the suggestions presented by the Iranian side, the Armenian side will be involved in the selection of the investor and shall present all obtained information to the Iranian side through official channels.\"290 Based on the structure of these passages \u2013 the first one referring to Iranian feedback to the \"company\" involved with Armenia, and the second one referring to Armenian input to Iran on \"the investor\" \u2013 it appears likely that the reference to an \"investor\" concerned Iran's possible use of private investment for the railway segment in its country, not the replacement of Rasia in the Railway Project on the Armenian side.\n\nC-305, Meeting minutes of the Iran-Armenian-Iranian Technical Experts Subcommittee (Unofficial English Translation and Armenian Original), 27 July 2016, p. 1.\n\n*Id.*, p. 2.\n\n***c.

Borkowski, 21 January 2015, pp. 10-11.\n\n265.\n\nMr. Borkowski was not alone in considering possible amendments to the Railway Concession. During the Tehran meeting in November 2014, the Government provided him with a draft \"Treatment\" document which would amend certain provisions of the Railway Concession (the \"**Draft Railway Amendments**\").294 Among other things, the proposed amendments would shift to Rasia the cost of financing the land acquisition for the railway corridor.295 On 21 November 2014, Mr. Shahnazaryan of the Armenian Railway Construction Directorate reminded Mr. Borkowski about this proposal in writing, stating that \"[a]s you have mentioned you would like to make some amendments/supplements to the Concession Agreement as well,\" and asking him to provide comments as soon as possible.296\n\nC-18, Ministry of Transport, Proposed Treatment \u2013 \"On 'Making Amendments and Supplements to the Southern Armenia Railway Concession Agreement'\", November 2014.\n\n*Id.*, Sections 1.1, 1.2.\n\nR-29, Letter from A. Shahnazaryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 21 November 2014.\n\n266.\n\nOn 26 November 2014, Mr. Shahnazaryan wrote again to Mr. Borkowski, requesting the previously sought \"measurement data with WGS-84 coordinate system\" for the proposed alignment of the railway, so the Cadastre could \"give details on land significance\" and acquisition price of the properties that would have to be acquired to move forward with the Project. The information was requested \"within the shortest possible time in order to facilitate the further work.\"297 It is undisputed that Mr. Borkowski did not respond to this request in writing. He explained at the Hearing that he felt nothing further was needed from Rasia from this time, and that the more important objective from his perspective was arranging project finance.298\n\nR-30, Letter from A. Shahnazaryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 26 November 2014.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 3, Borkowski, 462:8-20.\n\n267.\n\nOn 4 December 2014, Mr. Shahnazaryan wrote again to Mr. Borkowski, with a \"kind reminder\" that the Government had not received Rasia's \"comments and amendments\" on the draft \"Treatment\" document proposing amendments to the Railway Concession. On 10 December 2014, Mr. Borkowski replied, rejecting Armenia's proposed amendments as \"unacceptable on th[e] basis\" that \"[a]ll amendments should improve the feasibility and the financing attractiveness\" of the Railway Project, and promising to send soon Rasia's own proposed amendments to the Railway Concession for the Government's consideration.299\n\nAA4, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Ashot Shahnazaryan, 10 December 2014.\n\n268.\n\nOn 11 December 2014, the day after receiving Mr. Borkowski's rejection of the Government's proposed amendments, the Government amended its prior 7 August 2014 Protocol, to extend the time for various governmental bodies to take actions with respect to the Railway Project.300\n\nR-114, Excerpts from the Minutes of the Sitting of Government of Republic of Armenia, On Making Amendments to the Protocol Decision Approved by Paragraph 26 of Protocol No. 33 of the Government of the Republic of Armenia dated August 7, 2014, 17 December 2014.\n\n269.\n\nOn 31 December 2014, Mr. Borkowski wrote again to reject Armenia's position on both the detailed land coordinates and Armenia's proposed Draft Railway Amendments. With respect to the former, Mr. Borkowski stated that \"[i]t would not be reasonable to commence complex railway design works prior to the signing of respective official agreements, receipt of technical input, and full cooperation\u2026.\" With respect to the latter, Mr. Borkowski expressed confusion that \"the Armenian government seeks to avoid any investment \u2026 and to further try to pass along its obligatory minimal investment responsibility\" to Rasia. He complained that \"[t]hese actions cast a shadow over the Armenia government's support\" of the Project. Mr. Borkowski further stated that \"[f]or future reference, any proposed amendments to the [Railway Concession] must enhance the feasibility and bankability of the project \u2026 and will generally be proposed by Rasia FZE.\"301 As an example of such a proposed counter-offer, Mr. Borkowski stated that \"if the government of Armenia would like to \u2026 eliminate the government responsibility for acquiring the corridor land at its own cost,\" then Rasia \"would be glad to discuss\" Armenia's exercising its right of first investment under the Railway Concession by investing $100-150 million of its own funds in the Railway Project.302\n\nC-19, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 31 December 2014, pp. 1-2.\n\n*Id*., p. 3.\n\n270.\n\nThe Armenian Government seemingly never responded to this counterproposal,303 and has stated that it considered the issue of amendments to the Railway Concession closed.304 On 26 February 2015, the Armenian Government promulgated another decree (the \"**February 2015 Decree**\"), further extending the time to organize the land corridor. The third paragraph of the February 2015 Decree shows that the Government expected that negotiations would be held with Rasia, to \"submit a proposal to the government of the Republic of Armenia on the principles and mechanisms for the construction of the Southern Armenia Railway by May 30, 2015.\"305\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 2, Borkowski, 315:14-15.\n\nFirst Arakelyan Statement \u00b6 40.\n\nR-124, Excerpt from the Minutes of the Meeting of the Government of the Republic of Armenia, On Amendments to the Protocol Decision Approved by Paragraph 26 of Protocol No. 33 of the Government of the Republic of Armenia dated August 7, 2014, 26 February 2015.\n\n271.\n\nAs discussed further below (see para. 318), the Claimants maintain that the Government's proposed amendments came at a sensitive time when Rasia was trying to arrange financing, and were one of the main reasons why the Chairman of Aabar in January 2015 put on hold any purchase of Rasia.306 The Respondent contests this assertion, explaining that its proposal was aimed at creating more flexibility to move forward with the project at a time when Rasia was proposing amendments also, and that after Mr. Borkowski rejected the Government's proposed amendments, it did not return to the issue again.307\n\nSecond Tappendorf Statement \u00b6 14.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 7, McNeill/Arakelyan, 1324:18-1330:11.\n\n272.\n\nIt is undisputed that neither Rasia, nor the Government of Armenia communicated with the other at all between January and mid-October 2015. Meanwhile, through the summer of 2015, Mr. Borkowski focused his efforts on the Iranian section of the Railway as discussed in Section III.H.2 above, through negotiations with China Poly and arranging a meeting for China Poly with the Iranian government.\n\n273.\n\nThe Claimants now contend, as discussed in Section III.I below (from para. 292), that the Railway Project was effectively destroyed in 2015 by Armenia's alleged dealings with third parties in China, which caused CCCC to \"abandon\" the Railway Project in mid-March 2015.\n\n***d. Mutual complaints between August and December 2015***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nOn the Armenian side, in a letter of 14 August 2015, Mr. Shahnazaryan of the Armenian Railway Directorate wrote to Mr. Arakelyan, advising that Rasia's \"failure \u2026 to fulfil its obligations\" had negatively impacted implementation of various actions approved by the Government. In particular, he advised that for nearly a year, Rasia had not submitted coordinate measurement data in a form that the Cadastre could use to perform its work. He also stated that Rasia had not submitted a plan for completion of construction works, which by his reading of Section 36.2 of the Railway Concession, Rasia was required to do \"within one year after the end of the feasibility study.\" He advised that pursuant to Article XII of the Railway Concession, \"the Government \u2026 is entitled to terminate [the Railway Concession] prematurely\" for these reasons, and he suggested that the Ministry of Transport write immediately to Rasia about the legal consequences that could flow from its asserted failures.308 It appears that the Ministry of Transport did not, however, take the steps that Mr. Shahnazaryan advised.\n\nR-130, Letter from Mr. A. Shahnazaryan to Mr. A. Arakelyan, 14 August 2015.\n\n275.\n\nRather, after a long period of silence between the Parties, the next communication came from Rasia. On 14 October 2015 Mr. Borkowski wrote a letter addressed to Minister Beglaryan309 \u2013 which was also sent in copy to Prime Minister Abrahamyan310 \u2013 in which Mr. Borkowski expressed his concerns over \"recent reports in the media\" suggesting that the Ministry of Transport had invited \"third parties\" in China to participate in the Railway Project without consulting Rasia. That, \"[i]f true, \u2026 would constitute a blatant repudiation\" of the Railway Concession \"which establishes Rasia as the exclusive Concessionaire.\"311 These issues are addressed further below.\n\nC-34, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 14 October 2015.\n\nC-35, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Prime Minister H. Abrahamyan (attaching letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan), 14 October 2015.\n\nC-34, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 14 October 2015, p. 1.\n\n276.\n\nIn the same letter, Mr. Borkowski contended that for its part, Rasia had \"delivered on all of its obligations to date under the Concession Agreement, and ha[d] made contributions far in excess of its contractual duties that have been decisive to the continued success of the Project and of relations between the governments of China, Armenia and Iran.\"312 He asked the Government to confirm by 19 October 2015 that (i) the Government intended \"to fully honour its obligations to Rasia under the terms of the Concession Agreement,\" and (ii) to provide \"all documents and information regarding publically-disclosed [*sic*] offers from China; any agreements or understandings signed or reached; and any detailed explanations regarding its interaction with CCECC, China Export-Import Bank and the China Premier during the recent working visit regarding Rasia's Project.\"313\n\n*Id*., p. 4.\n\n*Id*., p. 5.\n\n277.\n\nMinister Grigoryan replied to Mr. Borkowski's letter on 19 October 2015, stating that the Government \"has caused no disruption whatsoever to the implementation\" of the Railway Project and \"has been meeting all the obligations and responsibilities set forth in the Concession Agreement, nor has it in any way restricted or stepped over the rights of Rasia.\" Mr. Grigoryan asserted that to the contrary, the Project \"has recently been put at risk by the improper handling of a number of issues by Rasia, and the Government has undertaken steps to ensure the Project is implemented smoothly and as a whole.\" He indicated that further details would be provided soon.314 On 28 October 2015, Rasia rejected the allegations in Mr. Grigoryan's 19 October 2015 letter, stating that the letter \"confirms the Armenian Government's breach and/or repudiation\" of the Railway Concession.315\n\nC-36, Letter from Mr. G. Grigoryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 19 October 2015.\n\nC-169, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Prime Minister H. Abrahamyan (attaching letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan), 28 October 2015.\n\n278.\n\nThe Parties corresponded further in November and December 2015. Mr. Arakelyan wrote to Mr. Borkowski on 17 November 2015, explaining that while the Government did not seek to remove Rasia from the Railway Project \u2013 and denied having \"signed any agreement with any other organization, which might violate the contractual rights of Rasia\" \u2013 it remained \"seriously concerned\" about what it viewed as Rasia's material breach of the Railway Concession. In particular, the Government pointed out (i) that Rasia owed it concession fees as per Section 4 of the Railway Concession; (ii) that Section 33 of the Railway Concession obligated Rasia to present the Government with letter(s) of interest from credible and reputable potential investors within 12 months of the date of approval of the Railway Feasibility Study, which Rasia had failed to do; (iii) that Rasia had failed to submit alignment coordinates for the Railway corridor in accordance with international standards; and (iv) that Rasia had not submitted design for the construction work, which Section 36 of the Railway Concession required Rasia to do within one year after the completion of the Feasibility Study.316\n\nC-37, Letter from Mr. Artur Arakelyan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 17 November 2015.\n\n279.\n\nMr. Borkowski's response, on 16 December 2015, reiterated Rasia's concerns that the Government had taken \"concrete steps to remove Rasia and its consortium partners from the Project,\" with reference to the Government's interactions with CCECC and the Chinese government (discussed in Section III.I below). Rasia also rejected the four alleged breaches of the Railway Concession, and concluded the letter with a formal declaration of a dispute pursuant to the Concession Agreement's dispute resolution clause, and a request for a prompt answer from the Government.317\n\nC-38, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 16 December 2015.\n\n***e. The March 2016 meeting and the June 2016 Notice of Dispute***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe Parties met in Armenia on 18 March 2016 (\"**the March 2016 Meeting**\") to discuss the Railway Project. The initial initiative for the meeting seems to have come from Armenia on 15 February 2016, to which Mr. Borkowski responded on 16 March 2016, proposing to meet two days later, when he would be in Armenia.318 At the March 2016 Meeting, the Armenian Ministry of Transport was represented by Mr. Grigoryan and Mr. Arakelyan, as well as by Mr. Hasmik Aharonyan and a Ministry lawyer.\n\nC-39, Letter from Minister G. Beglaryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 15 February 2016; C-40, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 16 March 2016.\n\n281.\n\nThe Parties' versions of the March 2016 Meeting differ. Mr. Borkowski says he explained that Aabar had decided to withdraw from the Projects; according to the Respondent, this was the first time it was informed of this, while Mr. Borkowski claims he had told Mr. Grigoryan a year earlier that Aabar would no longer participate. Mr. Borkowski says he also explained that CCCC no longer could be relied upon for the financing of the Railway Project, because of its concerns that Armenia's meetings with Chinese government officials had elevated the Railway Project to an intergovernmental level, which in turn had involved a different Chinese company, CCECC. The Respondent says that its representatives informed Mr. Borkowski that Armenia's meetings with the Chinese government were high-level and diplomatic in nature and did not involve details about financing or otherwise; they were intended to encourage Chinese support for the Railway Project, not to replace Rasia as the concessionaire; and that Armenia had not asked CCECC, or any other entity, to prepare an alternative feasibility study as Rasia had alleged.319\n\nSecond Borkowski Statement \u00b6\u00b6 175-176; February Tr.

Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 180-182.\n\n282.\n\nThere is both an audio recording and a transcript of the March 2016 Meeting.320 According to the transcript, the meeting closed with Mr. Arakelyan's suggestion to \"close this [dispute] and go forward,\" with a further meeting (perhaps the next day) to discuss a \"plan of action\" that Mr. Grigoryan would prepare for potential next steps on the Railway Project.321 That further meeting did not occur, however. Instead, the March 2016 Meeting was followed by various exchanges of correspondence between the Parties which concerned, among other things, these records of the Meeting.\n\nR-40, Transcript of the Meeting between Messrs.

Karapetyan, 18 March 2016, p. 8.\n\n283.\n\nBy letter of 29 March 2016, Mr. Borkowski confirmed that he had received the draft minutes of the March 2016 Meeting and promised to comment on them in early April.322 On 5 April 2016, Mr. Grigoryan asked for feedback on the draft minutes, and also on a \"sample time-line on the completion of the next steps and the obligations of the [Railway Concession],\" which the Ministry had shared with Mr. Borkowski following the March 2016 Meeting.323 That draft time-line had (a) asked Rasia to specify a date by which it would submit Railway \"coordinates meeting the international standards in accordance with the feasibility study\"; (b) pledged that the Government would approve the Corridor and exercise eminent domain over the applicable lands within six months of receiving appropriate coordinates; and (c) asked Rasia to specify the dates by which it would ensure financing of the Project by submission of appropriate letters of interest; and (d) asked Rasia for the date by which it would submit the design of construction civil works.324\n\nAA-7, Email from Mr. J.

(As discussed in Section III.H.2.b above, this meeting took place in Iran on 18-19 April 2016.)\n\n285.\n\nMr. Borkowski responded on 29 April 2016, without commenting on the draft minutes or proposed timeline of next steps, but requesting the audio recording of the March 2016 Meeting. He also expressed concern about media reports that the competing Iran-Azerbaijan railway had commenced, which (as discussed in Section III.H.2.b above) had long been considered a threat to obtaining support for the Railway Project.325\n\nC-177, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 29 April 2016.\n\n286.\n\nOn 17 June 2016, Mr. Grigoryan in turn expressed concern that Mr. Borkowski still had provided no feedback either on the minutes of the March 2016 Meeting, or on the \"plan-deadline\" for moving forward with the Railway Project. He suggested that Mr. Borkowski's failure to submit these items was \"hindering the fulfillment of the agreement obtained during the meeting, which is the confirmation of the plan-deadline in order to set clear dates to ensure the natural process of the project implementation.\" He set a deadline of 25 June 2016 for Rasia to provide information on its progress in \"integrating potential investors for the funding of the Project,\" including \"justified documents (memorandums, initial agreements, etc.). Finally, Mr. Grigoryan informed Mr. Borkowski of two recent events: (a) the expert meeting between Armenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Iran that had taken place on 18-19 April 2016, and that had resulted in a joint protocol on an international transport and transit corridor, and (b) the Chinese Vice Premier's visit to Armenia on 6 June 2016, at which the Railway Project was discussed along with other infrastructure projects in the fields of industry, energy, agriculture, science, transport, technology and culture.326\n\nC-43, Letter from Mr. G. Grigoryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 17 June 2016.\n\n287.\n\nIn response to the 17 June 2016 letter, on 25 June 2016, Mr. Borkowski sent the Government a notification of a dispute under the US-Armenia BIT (the \"**Notice of Dispute**\"). The Notice of Dispute recorded Rasia's surprise at having learned only after the fact about Armenia's meetings with Iran and China, which in Rasia's view provided \"further irrefutable evidence that Armenia has excluded Rasia and its contractor and lead member of Rasia's consortium, [CCCC], in total disregard for the exclusive rights granted to Rasia under the 2012 Concession Agreements.\" The Notice of Dispute also said that CCCC had recently informed Rasia that it intended to \"terminate contractual agreements with Rasia due to Armenia's coordination and conclusion of agreements with third parties and its exclusion of Rasia as concessionaire and consortium leader from the Railway and Road Projects.\"327\n\nC-53, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 25 June 2016, p. 8.\n\n**I. CCCC'****s** **I****nvolvement and** **W****ithdrawal from the** **P****rojects**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nGiven the importance of CCCC to the facts of this case, it is useful to recap here the main facts about its involvement in, and withdrawal from, the Projects. (In the next section, the Tribunal provides a similar summary regarding Aabar's involvement and withdrawal, which provides the sole basis for the theory of damages the Claimants have presented in this case.)\n\n289.\n\nAs already mentioned, CCCC was involved at the outset of the Projects, pursuant to the Rasia-CCCC Framework Agreement which envisioned that CCCC would prepare both Feasibility Studies; that it would become the \"exclusive EPC\" contractor for developing both Projects; and that it would assist Rasia with debt financing by approaching China EximBank and China Development Bank.328 It is suggested that CCCC's subsequent withdrawal from the Projects, and Rasia's related failure to obtain Chinese bank funding through CCCC, was a significant factor contributing to the collapse of the Projects. Below, the Tribunal briefly summarizes the facts relevant to CCCC's withdrawal.\n\nR-8, Rasia-CCCC Framework Agreement.\n\n290.\n\nThe Railway Feasibility Study provided a preliminary estimate of Project investment of about $3.2 billion, and stated that \"[i]t is currently anticipated that loans will be secured from the Export-Import Bank of China (interim) for approximately 60% of the Project cost at an annual interest rate of 3.5% implying that the remaining 40% of funds will need to be secured from regional governments and international financial institutions.\"329 Citing this passage of the Railway Feasibility Study, the Claimants contend that \"[d]uring the second half of 2013,\" CCCC had actually \"secured commitments\" from China EximBank to this effect.330 Mr. Borkowski testified at the Hearing that the inclusion of this sentence in the Railway Feasibility Study prepared by CCCC, together with contemporaneous discussions he had with Armenia, was sufficient to satisfy the Railway Concession's requirement that Rasia provide Armenia, within 12 months of final approval of the Feasibility Study, with \"letters of interest from \u2026 potential \u2026 finance providers \u2026 prepared to \u2026 provide debt financing \u2026.\"331 Yet this contention of \"commitments\" already having been secured from China EximBank is somewhat at odds with Mr. Borkowski's slide presentation during the February 2014 Yerevan Meetings, which stated that the Railway Project would be \"highly dependent on China bank negotiations,\" following certain \"preliminary discussions with China banks.\"332 That contemporaneous document seems to confirm that no actual funding commitments had yet been secured at that time.\n\nC-116, Railway Feasibility Study, p. 168.\n\nCl.

The Road Feasibility Study \"[a]nticipated that the Project should be able to secure loans from the Export-Import Bank of China or China Development Bank for approximately 60-85% of the Project investment requirement an annual interest rate to be determined based on the negotiation of the availability payments contract.\"333 The phrasing \"should be able to secure\" no doubt suggested optimism by CCCC, but it does not support the Claimants' contention that by this time CCCC had actually \"secured commitments\" to finance the Project.334 The record does not reflect any actual documents from China EximBank, or any other Chinese bank, demonstrating such a commitment.335\n\nC-122, Southern Armenia High Speed Road Feasibility Study, p. 125.\n\nCl.

The Parties dispute the exact nature of what was discussed, and what implications that may or may not have had for CCCC's willingness to participate in the Projects.\n\nCl.

The Parties' characterizations of this meeting differ, with the Claimants suggesting it centered on CCECC's involvement in the Railway Project and the Respondent contending that the meeting had been initiated by the \"Chinese side,\" with a broad agenda.337 Handwritten notes from the Ministry of Transport's information service suggest that \"[d]uring the meeting, the Chinese party expressed interest in the construction project of the South railroad due to its crucial role in the region. Gagik Beglaryan and [CCECC managing director] Hao Jiyong discussed the possibility that this major Chinese company may participate in the implementation of the above project.\"338 A Ministry of Transport press release also stated that the two men \"discussed the possibility of the Chinese largest company's participation in the implementation\" of the Southern railway.339\n\nCl.

More specifically this concerns the North-South Highway and the Southern Railway projects as part of the Silk Road.\n\nIn order to discuss these projects in more details and to speed up the process of clarifications on your potential participation in their implementation, herewith I would like to invite you to Yerevan some time at your own convenience within the upcoming month, prior to the Armenian Delegation visit to Beijing in September.344\n\nC-307, Letter from Minister G.

The Ministry of Transport's participation was part of a broader delegation, led by Armenia's Prime Minister and including also senior leaders from the Ministries of Economy, Finance and Foreign Affairs, as well as the Central Bank. An internal meeting summary from the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms that \"[d]uring the meeting, discussions were held on the Iran-Armenia rail line, investments and construction of the North-South Corridor Expressway,\" and the Chinese Prime Minister \"reaffirmed the interest of the Chinese side \u2026.\"345\n\nC-302, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia, Annual Report Summary of the Asia, Oceania, and Africa Committee, Year 2015, providing report of state visit of Prime Minister H.

On 6 September 2015, Mr. Dai Ning of China Poly wrote to Mr. Borkowski to let him know that he had been \"approached by some companies regarding the railway in Armenia connecting Iran very recently. It seems that Armenia government is inviting some companies to participate and provide financing to the project. I just wonder if you have any update on this project and what shall we do at this moment?\"348 Mr. Borkowski replied on 17 September 2015, thanking Mr. Dai Ning for taking time to meet with Aabar representatives in Beijing, and promising to send a \"draft non-binding framework agreement giving Poly exclusivity and conditional on conversion of the Rasia agreements into G2G cooperation in Iran and Armenia.\"349 Four days later, Mr. Borkowski wrote to inform Mr. Dai Ning of the Armenian Prime Minister's visit to Beijing, which he stated was arranged by CCEEC along with China EximBank \"and is in relation to my railway project.\" Mr. Borkowski complained that the Prime Minister \"had accepted the CCECC invite without coordinating with me, but rather than tell the PM how he should be coordinating the Armenia railway project affairs, I will discuss this with the PM and Minister in Armenia following his visit. I will provide an update afterwards including how it will affect cooperation we might have on the Armenia rail link. The Iran side has not changed its approach.\"350 The next day, Mr. Borkowski wrote another email to Mr. Dai Ning, attaching the link to a news article seemingly reporting from the state visit in Beijing, and stating that \"I will get a summary of the visit and remind [the Armenian Prime Minister] that we control the railway project and that Poly is our preferred partner including on a G2G or government guaranty basis.\"351\n\nC-271, Email from Dai Ning to Mr. J.

The press article reporting this statement referred specifically to a feasibility study developed \"[i]n cooperation with Dubai-based investment company, Rasia FZE,\" but did not identify which Chinese companies were working on feasibility studies.355\n\nC-23, \"Ambassador of China: It Will Be Possible to Speak of Expediency of Iran-Armenia Project after Preparation of Feasibility Study\" (ArmInfo), 16 November 2015.\n\n303.\n\nLater, in its early 2016 discussions with Iran (see above paras. 259-261) Armenia stated that a railway feasibility study \"had been conducted by a Chinese company,\"356 which in the Claimants' submission, could refer either to the Railway Feasibility Study CCCC prepared on behalf of Rasia (evidencing that Armenia relied on this Feasibility Study as valid in early 2016), or to a separate one prepared by CCECC (suggesting that a competing study indeed had been prepared).357\n\nC-308, \"Mission report on the results of the delegation visit headed by the Minister of Transport and Communication of the Republic of Armenia\" submitted by G.

On the Armenia side, they need the WGS 84 coordinates in order to progress but I cannot get those without the next stage. I am working on the Iran side now.\n\nOn the road, the project is failing and is stopped with the Spanish EPC problems.\n\nMr. Borkowski indicated he would send \"a more detailed update soon.\"359 There is no record evidence of that update, but as noted above, Claimants contend that by mid-March 2015, Mr. Weixin informed Mr. Borkowski that CCCC was withdrawing from the Railway Project, because the Chinese Ministry of Commerce had reserved the Project for CCECC.360\n\nCl.

The withdrawal of Aabar's interest in investing in Rasia is critically important for this case, as the projected value to Rasia of that investment forms the sole basis for Rasia's calculation of damages in this Arbitration.\n\n307.\n\nTo recall points about Aabar discussed above, Mr. Borkowski testified that in his view, the \"essence\" of his bargain with Armenia was that \"Aabar was to be the anchor investor in the Projects once their feasibility had been established.\"364 In June 2012, Mr. Tappendorf (then of Aabar) had written to Armenia, promising \"to review the railway and road development projects with a focus on economic feasibility and investment and either directly or through our affiliates consider equity investments and/or lending.\"365 On 31 July 2012, three days after the Concession Agreements were signed, Rasia advised the Government that it had met with Aabar to discuss \"the prospects of equity investments\" in connection with the Railway Project.366 On 29 October 2013, Mr. Borkowski proposed to Aabar's CEO an equity transaction that would allow it to \"own and control [this] strategic railway,\" which he said would enable Aabar's subsidiary Arabtec to become \"Master Developer, Contractor [and] Railway Owner.\" Mr. Borkowski also described the Railway Project as benefiting from \"[s]ignificant financing\" coming from \"3rd parties (up to 85% [C]hina banks and 15% ADFD and Eurasian Development Bank).\"367 Although the proposal to Aabar referenced \"the ability to partner with China company,\"368 it made no specific mention of Rasia's prior agreement to appoint CCCC \"as the lead member of its Consortium and exclusive EPC for developing\" the Railway Project.369 The Claimants say that at some point in late October 2013, the Aabar CEO confirmed his interest in investing in both Projects, which was communicated to Mr. Borkowski through Mr. Tappendorf.370\n\nSecond Borkowski Statement \u00b6 31.\n\nC-11, Letter from Mr. C.

The Parties agree that the Aabar deal failed to materialize, but they disagree as to the reason(s) for the failed deal. The facts underlying these disputes are recounted below.\n\n309.\n\nIn April 2014, Mr. Tappendorf prepared a presentation about the Projects for the Aabar chairman H.E. Khadem Al Quibaisi, (the \"**Tappendorf Presentation**\"). Mr. Tappendorf suggested there would be significant value in Aabar's acquisition of the Projects, including \"Arabtec as EPC partner alongside CCCC,\" with Arabtec described as \"joint EPC\" and the suggestion that Aabar could \"add 10% to EPS for [its] management of project.\"371 The Tappendorf Presentation also stated that Aabar could \"significantly reduce cost of capital for project financing through G2G arrangement,\" including for the Railway Project a \"G2G de-risking\" and for the Road Project an \"Armenian government guaranty through availability payments\" expected to cover \"principal, interest, returns.\"372 The Presentation also listed the \"key future milestones required from Rasia\" before the Projects could be at the stage at which Aabar would invest, including Armenia's acceptance of the Feasibility Studies, a \"trilateral co-operation agreement between Armenia-Rasia-Iran on railway linkages,\" an agreement between Aabar and Rasia on acquisition terms, and \"definitive documents and standard due diligence.\"373 According to Mr. Tappendorf's witness statements in this Arbitration, the Aabar Chairman reacted positively and expressed a wish to complete the deal once the identified milestones had been reached.374\n\nC-135, \"Armenia Strategic Infrastructure Projects, Chairman Summary\" (Aabar), April 2014, pp. 2, 4.\n\n*Id.*, pp. 2, 4.\n\n*Id.*, p. 5; First Tappendorf Statement \u00b6 61.\n\nFirst Tappendorf Statement \u00b6 62.\n\n310.\n\nThere are two related letters dated 21 September 2014 on the record, both written by Mr. Tappendorf.375 The first376 is a memo written to Mr. Al Quibaisi, which contained an update on the progress on both Projects since the Tappendorf Presentation in April 2014. It stated that Armenia had accepted the Railway Feasibility Study, but had not yet accepted the Road Feasibility Study. The memo further said that \"Rasia remains willing to pursue a sale of both projects with [A]abar and involving Arabtec and has agreed with the high end of our previously discussed April terms.\" It also stated that Armenia had requested an \"expression of interest from a 3rd party in support of Rasia for financing the remaining 40%\" Railway Project, and that Rasia had requested proceeding \"with the sale of both projects to [A]abar.\" Under the heading \"Concerns of [A]abar/potential risks,\" Mr. Tappendorf also wrote the following:\n\n- July media of other parties willing to fund the road project\n\n- No feedback from Armenia to Rasia on the road project feasibility study\n\n- Competing feasibility study and/or design works having been granted to other parties.\n\nThe memo concluded with a recommendation that Aabar drop the acquisition of the Road Project, and instead focus solely on the Railway Project. Mr. Tappendorf suggested that the drafting of definitive agreements for the latter should start in early 2015, \"after the planned signing of trilateral cooperation between Armenia-Rasia-Iran, ensuring Iran linkages will be in place.\" Mr. Tappendorf also recommended that Aabar issue a \"soft\" Expression of Interest letter to Rasia, to be shown to the Armenian Government.377\n\nC-13, Letter from Mr. C.

The letter had the subject \"Expression of Interest, Southern Armenia Railway (Armenia-Iran Railway).\" The letter noted that the Railway Feasibility Statement had stated \"the China contractor's initial indications of interest\" from China EximBank for funding \"at least of 60% of the project \u2026 without a sovereign guaranty,\" and stated that Aabar believed it had the ability \"to arrange the remaining 40% financing in the form of similar low cost debt along with playing the management role\" in the EPC contract through Arabtec. Aabar would require that Rasia sell \"100%\" of the Railway Project \"at a standard multiple (i.e. 5-7x) of the $10 million base feasibility study and alignment design expense,\" and would require that Rasia remain involved during the duration of the EPC works \"in exchange for a market comparable consulting fee (i.e. 5% of the EPC contract). This would enable all flows to equity to be for the benefit of Aabar Investments with all of the EPC profits benefitting Arabtec Construction.\"379\n\nFebruary Tr.

As discussed below, Mr. Borkowski testified during the February Hearing that the reference to Arabtec enjoying all of the EPC profits was a \"drafting error,\" which the Respondent disputes.\n\n312.\n\nAs will be developed further below, the Parties dispute precisely what type of undertaking Aabar made in this letter. The letter was subsequently delivered in person by Mr. Borkowski to Mr. Arakelyan on 10 November 2014.380\n\nSecond Borkowski Statement \u00b6 78; First Arakelyan Statement \u00b6 39.\n\n313.\n\nMr. Tappendorf testified that by late November 2014, he considered that the milestones he identified in April 2014 had been met.381 In a memorandum dated 22 December 2014, Aabar Chief Financial Officer (and a witness in this Arbitration) Mr. Andrew Thornber sent a memo to the Aabar Finance and Investment Committee, recommending the 100% purchase of Rasia shares, for which USD 105 million (plus a USD 5 million contingency) was to be allocated. The memo stated that Rasia had contributed \"100% of the equity investment of USD 15 million\" towards the Feasibility Studies and working designs, and accordingly that \"the 100% ownership is maintained by Joseph Borkowski.\" Both projects were said to have been \"completed with a positive result,\" with the \"major project being the railway [which] was formally accepted by Armenia.\"382 As for the Road Project, the memo reported that Aabar's legal team considered it automatically accepted under the Road Concession's terms, even though Armenia had not provided any written acceptance, and Aabar's investment team believed that the Aabar acquisition of Rasia would convince the Government to support the Road Project as well.\n\nFirst Tappendorf Statement \u00b6 68.\n\nC-146, Memorandum from Mr. A. Thornber to Aabar Finance and Investment Committee, 22 December 2014.\n\n314.\n\nAttached to Mr. Thornber's 22 December 2014 memo was, among other things, an 18 December 2014 term sheet that Mr. Tappendorf had prepared, reflecting what he considered had been agreed with Rasia for the purchase of 100% of its shares (the \"**Aabar Term Sheet**\" or the \"**Term Sheet**\"). The Aabar Term Sheet was an internal document, and it was not signed by either Aabar or Rasia. It reflected a proposed purchase price of USD 105 million, to be paid upon closing of the transaction which was expected \"no later than 30 April 2015.\" The terms of the sale provided that it would be on an \"as is\" basis, free \"from charges or liabilities except as disclosed,\" with a footnote providing that \"Rasia to repay USD 15m credit with CCCC.\" Furthermore, under the heading \"Conditions Subsequent to Closing,\" it was provided that Aabar and Rasia were to \"enter into EPC consulting agreement with Joseph Borkowski \u2026 for value equal to 5% of the EPC for the Southern Armenia Railway only and to be paid proportionately as EPC works are completed.\" A separate \"operations consulting agreement\" with Mr. Borkowski was to provide him \"3% of the total annual sales\" for the Railway, for the first 30 years of the concession.383\n\nC-145, Aabar, Term Sheet, 18 December 2014.\n\n315.\n\nMr. Thornber has testified that Aabar's Finance and Investment Committee approved the proposed transaction \"shortly after\" his 22 December 2014 memo,384 although there is no decision as such on the record. Mr. Thornber also testified that he proceeded to \"ring-fence\" the funds necessary for the purchase, so by the end of December, \"all internal approvals for the transaction had been obtained.\"385\n\nFirst Thornber Statement \u00b6 36.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 36.\n\n316.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Mr. Borkowski never informed it of the plan to sell Rasia to Aabar, which the Respondent argues was a violation of Sections 8.2(e) of both Concessions, which gave Armenia a right of first refusal to acquire Rasia's shares. The Respondent maintains that it was only at the March 2016 Meeting that Armenia was informed of the potential equity transaction and the failure of the same.386\n\nResp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 134, 150.\n\n317.\n\nIn any event, the Rasia-Aabar transaction never took place. The Parties have different versions of the events that transpired beginning in early 2015 that led to Aabar's withdrawal in March 2015.\n\n318.\n\nIn early January 2015, Aabar put the transaction on hold. In the Claimants' telling, this decision, as well as Aabar's ultimate withdrawal in March 2015, was prompted by various actions by the Respondent. According to Mr. Tappendorf, Aabar's chairman expressed concern over Armenia's attempts unilaterally to terminate the Road Project, as well as the Government's stance on the financing of the Railway Project. The Claimants say that by this time, it had become clear that both Projects were under threat. That had prompted the Aabar chairman to instruct Mr. Tappendorf to put the acquisition temporarily on hold in January 2015, in order to \"better assess the situation in Armenia.\"387\n\nFirst Tappendorf Statement \u00b6 73; Second Tappendorf Statement \u00b6\u00b6 76-77; Cl.

First PHB \u00b6 250.\n\n319.\n\nIn late February 2015, two articles appeared in Armenian press (the \"**Press Reports**\"), which, the Claimants argue, informed Aabar's decision to withdraw from acquiring Rasia. These news reports recount remarks from Minister Beglaryan about a two-month postponement of the deadline for adopting a Government measure related to amendments of the Railway Concession and action plans for construction of the Railway Project. The Press Reports state that Mr. Beglaryan attributed the delay to a \"negative posture on some matters by the concessionaire.\"388 One report also quotes an economist, Mr. Ashot Yeghiazaryan, as saying that Rasia \"prevents the construction of the Iran-Armenia railway.\"389\n\nC-151, \"The First Obstacle of the Iran-Armenia Railway is the Concessionaire of the Armenian Railway\" (Aravot), 28 February 2015; *see also C*-150, \"The Prime Minister too has no Hope of Iran-Armenia Railway\" (Aravot), 26 February 2015 (\"Beglaryan connected postponement \u2026 [with] having a negative attitude caused by the concessionaires\").\n\nC-151, \"The First Obstacle of the Iran-Armenia Railway is the Concessionaire of the Armenian Railway\" (Aravot), 28 February 2015.\n\n320.\n\nThe Claimants say that these Press Reports prompted Aabar's ultimate decision to withdraw. In Mr. Tappendorf's recollection, in March 2015, Mr. Al-Qubaisi instructed him that \"Aabar must withdraw from the investment\" as a reaction to the recent news of the Government's stance, which had rendered the Projects \"too risky and politically sensitive.\"390\n\nFirst Tappendorf Statement \u00b6\u00b6 73-77; *see* also Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 253-256.\n\n321.\n\nAccording to the Respondent's version of events, Aabar's failure to follow through on the proposed deal with Rasia was not motivated by any action or inaction on Armenia's part, but instead was part of the fallout of the so-called \"**1MDB Scandal**,\" a large-scale fraud involving the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB and Aabar's parent company International Petroleum Investment Company (\"**IPIC**\"), which ultimately led to Aabar's collapse. In April 2015 Mr. Al-Qubaisi, whom Mr. Tappendorf had advised about the potential Rasia acquisition, was removed as Aabar chairman in connection with the 1MDB Scandal. In June 2015, he was arrested and subsequently sentenced to 15 years in jail for his involvement in the Scandal.391 The Respondent says that even before these events, there were \"questions about 1MDB,\" as evidenced by press reports in February 2015 and news spreading in Malaysia even in 2014.392\n\nR-42, B.

They argue that the key events of that scandal \u2013 including Mr. al-Qubaisi's resignation \u2013 transpired after the Rasia-Aabar deal already had fallen through for unrelated reasons in January-March 2015, and as such, it could not have had any impact on the intended transaction.393\n\nCl.

However, it seems to be common ground that by the time of the 25 June 2016 Notice of Dispute, the existence of a dispute was known to both sides. The Respondent replied to the Notice of Dispute on 9 September 2016, in a letter signed by Minister Beglaryan, stating that in Armenia's view, the Claimants had breached both Concessions.394 Mr. Borkowski responded to Minister Beglaryan's 9 September 2016 letter on 20 October 2016. In his letter, this time addressed to Mr. Vahan Martirosyan, who by then had replaced Mr. Beglaryan as Minister for Transport, Mr. Borkowski disagreed with Armenia's characterization of Rasia's performance under the Concessions, and he confirmed his intention to proceed to ICSID arbitration.395\n\nC-183, Letter from Minister G.

On 10-11 October 2016, Mr. Arakelyan presented the Southern Armenia Railway Project at the Armenian Investment Forum in New York.396 According to the Claimants, the presentation incorporated findings from the Railway Feasibility Study, and offered prospective investors rights that conflicted with Rasia's exclusive rights under the Railway Concession.397 In a separate presentation later that same month to the Group of Experts on the Euro-Asian Transport Links, the Government confirmed that it was considering further financing for Tranche 4 of the NSRC from various institutions, including EDB and ADB.398 On 11 January 2017, the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs distributed an information package entitled \"Public-Private Partnership Opportunities and Financial Resources Necessary for the Construction of the Armenia railway project.\" Among other things, the material invited prospective investors to \"become party to a tripartite agreement with [Rasia] and the Republic of Armenia,\" about which Rasia claims not to have been aware. The Claimants allege that this marketing material also incorporated findings from the Railway Feasibility Study.399\n\nC-44, Republic of Armenia, \"Investment Projects\", Armenia Investment Forum, New York, 10-11 October 2016.\n\nCl.

The ADB response clarified that most of the requested documents were in the possession of the Armenian Government, to which Mr. Borkowski was referred.400 On 5 March 2017, Mr. Borkowski lodged a Request for Information Pursuant to Armenian Law on Freedom of Information with the Ministry of Transport, asking for access to specific documents relating to both Projects and the Respondent's alleged breaches.401 On 14 March 2017, Mr. Grigoryan responded to the request on behalf of the Government, informing Mr. Borkowski that \"the entire requested information has been posted to the official websites of the President of the Republic of Armenia, the Government of the Republic of Armenia and the [Ministry of Transport] of Armenia.\"402\n\nC-29, Letter from Mr. J.

The Claimants first offered to settle all disputes between the Parties in a 7 February 2017 letter which contained two alternative proposals for settlement. The first proposal involved Armenia's payment of $40 million to Rasia for mutual termination of both Concessions; the second proposal involved Armenia's contribution of $150 million to a new joint venture company established to undertake the Railway Concession only, which would be owned 51% by Rasia and 49% by Armenia.403\n\nC-48, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister V. Martirosyan, 7 February 2017.\n\n328.\n\nOn 9 June 2017, Minister Martiroysan replied that Armenia did not see any ground for a dispute regarding the Road Project, while not mentioning the Railway Project. The Minister nevertheless invited Mr. Borkowski to the Ministry for a meeting.404 Mr. Borkowski confirmed, on 14 June 2017, his willingness to meet on 3 July 2017. In the same letter, Mr. Borkowski also noted that Mr. David Harutyunyan had recently been appointed Minister of Justice of Armenia, and suggested this raised potential conflicts of interest given Mr. Harutyunyan's prior involvement in advising Rasia at earlier stages of the Projects.405 In a further letter on 27 June 2017, Mr. Borkowski requested the audio recording from the earlier March 2016 Meeting, as well as a written response to the 6 February 2017 settlement offer. He also asked that the meeting be audio recorded.406\n\nC-200, Letter from Minister V. Martirosyan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 9 June 2017.\n\nC-201, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister V.

The following individuals were present at the meeting, according to the transcript of the audio recording: Mr. Borkowski, Mr. Martirosyan (Minister of Transport), Mr. Harutyunyan (Minister of Justice), Mr. Grigoryan, and Mr. Ashot Boghossian (advisor to the Ministry of Transport).407 No concrete progress was made in terms of a potential settlement at the meeting. Among other things, the Government stated that the two Concessions remained in force. It complained that Mr. Borkowski had not submitted any action plan to restart the Railway Project, as the Government had requested at the March 2016 Meeting discussed in Section III.H.2. Mr. Borkowski emphasized that this was an \"unreasonable\" request to which he had not agreed, since his \"consortium\" (which he described as involving financing \"pulled together \u2026 between China Exim Bank and the Abu Dhabi government\") \"was dismantled already,\" as he had explained at the March 2016 Meeting. The meeting closed with Minister Harutyunyan saying that Armenia would review its position with respect to the Projects and revert back to Mr. Borkowski.408\n\nC-318, Transcript of 3 July 2017 Meeting, 3 July 2017.\n\n*Id*., pp. 5:20-26; 13:12-15; 14:9-36; Cl.

In one letter, the Minister wrote that \"[t]he record clearly shows that Rasia, by its own admission, has failed to perform its responsibilities under the Agreements and is therefore in breach.\" It went on to outline the Government's view of Rasia's failure to perform under both Concessions, and it concluded that \"Rasia is free to file a claim against the Government with ICSID.\"409\n\nC-49, Letter from Minister V. Martirosyan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 27 July 2017.\n\n331.\n\nThe other letter from Minister Martirosyan contained a settlement offer, \"open for [Mr. Borkowski's] acceptance until August the 25th, 2017.\" The offer limited Rasia's future role to potentially receiving fees from \"invest[ing] any prior work performed and paid for by Rasia or you\" into the Projects, should the Government find any new parties \"who are willing and able to develop the Projects, which Rasia was commissioned to develop, but failed to do.\"410\n\nC-50, Letter from Minister V. Martirosyan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 27 July 2017.\n\n332.\n\nMr. Borkowski responded to the two letters on 1 August 2017, in a letter denying the allegations contained therein and rejecting the Government's settlement offer.411\n\nC-51, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister V. Martirosyan, 1 August 2017.\n\n333.\n\nAfter the Parties failed to reach a settlement, Armenia proceeded to pursue the involvement of other entities in the Projects. Separately, on 7 November 2017, the Transport Ministry published a message on its web site which explained that the Government intended to proceed with the Railway Project without the Claimants:\n\nThe Government has been patient with RASIA FZE, but the company has not met the deadlines and other contractual obligations.\n\nTaking into consideration the abovementioned and the strategic significance of this Program for the Republic of Armenia, the Government of RA is undertaking efforts to complete the railway separately from RASIA FZE.412\n\nC-57, Ministry of Transport Website: On the Implementation Process of the Concession Agreement of Southern Railway of Armenia (http://www.mtcit.am/pages.php?lang=3&id=6834&page\\_name=news#), 9 November 2017, accessed on 11 July 2018.\n\n334.\n\nAlso in November 2017, Armenia sought further investments in the Sisian-Kajaran road (which overlaps with the Road Concession), in marketing documents which also noted that the Government would contribute about USD 200 million for the construction of this portion of the road.413\n\nC-46, Republic of Armenia, \"Public-Private Partnership Opportunities and Financial Resources Necessary for the Construction of Sisian- Kajaran Section, Tranche 4, of North-South Road Corridor Investment Program\", 11 January 2017.

Mem. \u00b6 156).\n\n335.\n\nIn March 2018, the Transport Ministry reached a framework agreement with the Italian company Anas International, allowing the company to conduct feasibility studies for the construction and operation of the Sisian-Kajaran road. In June 2018, the Government also invited tender bids for the construction of this part of the road.414\n\nC-210, \"Italy's Anas International to explore construction of Sisian- Kajaran section of North-South Road Corridor\" (ArmenPress), 14 March 2018; C-211, Ministry of Transport Website: \"The Italian company will carry out a study of the Sisian-Qajaran road section under the signed agreement\"(http://www.mtcit.am/pages.php?lang=3&page\\_id=1&id=6949&pa ge\\_name=news#), 14 March 2018, accessed on 5 June 2019; C-212, Ministry of Transport Website: \"Chinese company interested in Armenia's road construction projects\" (http://mtcit.am/pages.php?lang=3&page\\_id= 1&id=7020&page\\_name=news#), 13 June 2018, accessed on 5 June 2019.\n\n336.\n\nThe Armenian Government sought Chinese involvement in the NSRC, and to this end met with Chinese officials in November 2018 and with the China Railway Group in May 2019.

THE PARTIES' CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Claimants in the Arbitration request the Tribunal to render an award:\n\n(i) DECLARING that Armenia has violated its obligations under the Treaty and international law and, in particular, has expropriated the Claimants' investments in violation of customary international law and, in respect of the second named Claimant, in violation of Article III(1) of the Treaty, has failed to accord the second named Claimant's investments, and the management, enjoyment, operation and disposal thereof, treatment that is fair and equitable, non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory in violation of Articles II(2)(a) and II(2)(b) of the Treaty, and has failed to observe its obligations with regard to the second named Claimant's investments in violation of Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty;\n\n(ii) DECLARING that Armenia is in material breach of its obligations under the Railway and Road Concession Agreements, and its obligations arising under the Foreign Investment Law of Armenia;\n\n(iii) ORDERING Armenia, by way of satisfaction, to issue a public apology to the Claimants for violation of its obligations under the Treaty, international law, the Concession Agreements and Armenian law with respect to the Claimants' investment in a form to be determined by the Tribunal following further submissions;\n\n(iv) ORDERING Armenia to pay the Claimants compensation in the amount of US$225 million, or in such other amount sufficient to wipe out the consequences of Armenia's wrongful acts and omissions, to be paid in a freely convertible currency;\n\n(v) ORDERING Armenia to pay interest on any compensation awarded, at a commercial rate and compounding interval to be determined by the Tribunal following further submissions, accruing from 18 March 2015 until payment in full;\n\n(vi) ORDERING Armenia to pay all costs in connection with these proceedings, including the costs of the Tribunal and of ICSID, as well as legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimants including the fees of their legal counsel, experts and consultants, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention; and\n\n(vii) ORDERING such other or additional relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate under the applicable law or as may otherwise be just and proper.416\n\nCl. Second PHB \u00b6 177.\n\n338.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, requests the Tribunal to issue an Award:\n\n(i) Dismissing Claimants' claims on the grounds that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction;\n\n(ii) In the alternative, dismissing Rasia's claims for breach of the Concession Agreements and Mr. Borkowski's claims for breach of the umbrella clause of the Treaty as time-barred;\n\n(iii) In the alternative, dismissing Claimants' claims on the merits in their entirety;\n\n(iv) In the alternative, declaring that Claimants are not entitled to any damages;\n\n(v) Ordering the Claimants to separately and together pay all costs incurred in connection with these arbitration proceedings, including their own costs, the costs of the arbitrators and ICSID, and the legal and other expenses incurred by the Respondent including the fees of its legal counsel, experts, and consultants, as well as the Respondent's own officials and employees on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a reasonable rate; and\n\n(vi) Granting such further relief against the Claimants as the Tribunal deems fit and proper.417\n\nResp.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear this dispute.418 Specifically, the Respondent argues that the Claimants did not make a qualifying investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (Section A),419 and that Mr. Borkowski cannot assert umbrella clause claims on behalf of Rasia under the BIT's umbrella clause (Section B).420\n\nResp.

Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 311, 315.\n\n343.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal should apply the *Salini* test, which requires a significant economic contribution to the host State.428 In the Respondent's view, this requirement applies to both the BIT and the ICSID Convention.429 The Respondent contends that the objective standard under the ICSID Convention must be met regardless of the definition of investment in the BIT.430 It is a double-barreled test, and the Claimants must satisfy the definition of investment in both the BIT and the ICSID Convention.431\n\nResp.

Egypt*, *Michell v. Congo,* and *OI European Group BV v.

The Respondent acknowledges that know-how, if it has economic value, may constitute a contribution.448 However, the Respondent argues that the Feasibility Studies were not accepted by Rasia and therefore have no value.449 It argues that CCCC's commercial agreements with Rasia expressly provide that CCCC owns all intellectual property, which ownership will be transferred upon payment; thus, since Rasia never paid for them, CCCC still owns the intellectual property in the Feasibility Studies.450\n\nResp.

Rej. \u00b6 324.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n350.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues that any contribution the Claimants made was akin to a commercial transaction, which does not qualify as an investment.454 In the Respondent's view, Mr. Borkowski acted as a commercial broker or intermediary of a transient nature, since he admitted that he intended to sell the Concessions from the outset. According to the Respondent, it is well established that pure commercial transactions do not qualify as investments.455\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 327.\n\n*Id*.

Counter-Mem. \u00b6 205.\n\n**(2) The Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Concessions, and their rights and obligations under the Concessions, constitute protected investments under Article I of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.457 Alternatively, the Claimants submit that they have made substantial contributions, as they say Article 15 of the Concessions indeed confirms.458\n\nCl.

Second PHB \u00b6 22.\n\n353.\n\nFirst, the Claimants stress that the BIT and the Concessions are the starting point to assess whether the Claimants have made a qualifying investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.459 The Claimants argue that their assets qualify as investments under Articles I(1)(a)(iii) and (v) of the BIT, as they constitute claims to money or performance having economic value and rights conferred by contract.460 Moreover, Armenia and Rasia recognized that the transactions to which the Concessions relate are investments and they agreed to ICSID arbitration as reflected in Articles XVII, Section 66.3, of both Concessions.461\n\nCl.

Turkmenistan*, where the tribunal analyzed an identical definition of investment in the Turkmenistan-United Kingdom BIT. The tribunal found the BIT definition of an investment, which included claims to money or to performance having economic value, as well as the concession rights under certain concession agreements, to be within the scope of \"investment\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.474\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 475.\n\n*Id*.

In construing the terms of the ICSID Convention \u2013 as with the terms of the BIT \u2013 the Tribunal is guided by the interpretative principles reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"). In particular, under VCLT Article 31, the provisions of the Convention and the BIT are to be interpreted and applied in accordance with the \"ordinary meaning\" of their terms, in the \"context\" in which they occur and in light of the treaties' \"object and purpose.\"492 The relevant \"context\" for construing the provisions of a treaty can include the words and sentences found in close proximity to that passage, including definitional terms, as well as other provisions of the same treaty which help to illuminate its object and purpose.493 In accordance with Article 32 of the VCLT, \"[r]ecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of a treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion,\" but only \"to confirm the meaning\" resulting from the textual approach required by Article 31, or in the event the textual approach leaves a meaning \"ambiguous or obscure\" or would lead to a result that is \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"494 The ICJ has explained (in a case preceding the VCLT but cited by the International Law Commission in preparing the VCLT) that \"a decisive reason\" (such as unmistakable evidence of the State Parties' intentions from supplementary materials) would be required \"[t]o warrant an interpretation other than that which ensues from the natural meanings of the words\" of a provision.495\n\nVCLT, Article 31(1).\n\n*See generally Kili\u00e7 \u012cn\u015faat \u012cthalat \u012chracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/1, Award \u00b6 5.2.6 (2 July 2013) (\"Treaty terms are obviously not drafted in isolation, and their meaning can only be determined by considering the entire treaty text. The context will include the remaining terms of the sentence and of the paragraph; the entire article at issue; and the remainder of the treaty [\u2026].\").\n\nVCLT, Article 32.\n\n*Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations* (Charter, Art.4), Advisory Opinion: 1948 I.C.J Reports 57, p. 63.\n\n362.\n\nFor purposes of the jurisdictional analysis, the Tribunal follows the framework established by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. This establishes jurisdiction over \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State \u2026 and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\" In this case, there is no dispute about the qualifying nationality of the Parties: Armenia has been a Contracting State since 1992; Rasia is a juridical national of the United Arab Emirates, which has been a Contracting State since 1982; and Mr. Borkowski is a national of the United States, which has been a Contracting State since 1966.496 Accordingly, for purposes of this case, there are two central conditions for jurisdiction under Article 25(1): (a) that the Parties have \"consent[ed] in writing\" to ICSID jurisdiction, and (b) that the dispute \"aris[es] directly out of an investment\" by the Claimants. These two requirements are discussed separately below.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 352(iii), (iv). Respondent has not disputed the Claimants' qualifying nationality.\n\n***a. \"Consent in writing\"***\n-----------------------------\n\n363.\n\nThe first requirement of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, namely that the Parties have \"consent[ed] in writing\" to submit the relevant class of disputes to ICSID jurisdiction, requires the examination of different instruments of consent for the two different Claimants.\n\n364.\n\nFor Rasia, which presents only contractual claims under the Road Concession and the Railway Concession (not any treaty claims), the issue is whether these Concessions reflect mutual consent to ICSID arbitration. There is little question that they do. Article XVII, Section 66.3 of both Concessions states that \"the Government and the Concessionaire \u2026 hereby consent to submit to [ICSID] any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, for settlement by arbitration pursuant to\" the ICSID Convention.497 ICSID arbitration is the only dispute resolution forum provided in the Concessions, and Section 66.3 clearly demonstrates in writing the consent by both Rasia and Armenia to submit contractual disputes to ICSID arbitration.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Article XVII, Section 66.3; C-2, Road Concession, Article XVII, Section 66.3.\n\n365.\n\nMr. Borkowski is not a party to the Concession Agreements, and he therefore relies for consent on the BIT. Art. VII.1 of the BIT begins by defining an \"investment dispute\" as including, *inter alia*, a dispute between \"a Party and a national \u2026 of the other Party arising out of or relating to \u2026 an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\" Article VII.3(a) of the BIT then authorizes \"the national \u2026 concerned\" to choose among several dispute resolution *fora*, including ICSID arbitration, and Article VII.4 provides that each Party to the BIT \"hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with\" the national's choice of forum under Article VII.3. To avoid any doubt, Article VII.4 further confirms that these provisions \"shall satisfy the requirement for \u2026 written consent of the parties to the dispute for purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) \u2026.\"\n\n366.\n\nIn other words, the BIT clearly provides Armenia's written consent for U.S. nationals like Mr. Borkowski to submit to ICSID jurisdiction any claims alleging BIT violations, provided that such alleged violations are \"with respect to an investment.\" Deferring until the next section a discussion of the objective meaning of the term \"investment,\" the Parties to the BIT subjectively defined the term broadly, to \"mean[] every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service *and investment contracts* \u2026.\"498 The BIT also includes, in an illustrative list of covered investments, \"any right *conferred by \u2026 contract*.\"499 These statements reflect the BIT parties' shared understanding and intention that disputes alleging BIT violations with respect to \"investment contracts,\" entered into between Armenia and companies owned or controlled by U.S. nationals, would qualify for ICSID jurisdiction.\n\nArticle I(1)(a) of the BIT (emphasis added).\n\nArticle I(1)(a)(v) of the BIT (emphasis added).\n\n367.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that both the Concession Agreements and the BIT identify ICSID arbitration as an available forum for resolving disputes of the nature now presented. Based on these provisions, the Tribunal concludes that the first requirement of ICSID Convention Article 25(1), namely that the Parties to a dispute have \"consent[ed] in writing\" to submit the relevant class of disputes to ICSID jurisdiction, is satisfied.\n\n***b. \"Investment\" by the Claimants***\n--------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nHowever, this is not the end of the interpretative exercise. Armenia contends that irrespective of any written consent to ICSID arbitration reflected in the Concessions and/or the BIT, the Claimants cannot establish the second predicate for arbitration under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which is that they must establish that the dispute has \"arise[n] directly out of an investment.\" Armenia contends, essentially, that the objective meaning of the term \"investment\" cannot extend to a circumstance where a foreign national concluded an investment agreement with a State, but (as Armenia contends in this case) thereafter made no real contribution of resources in implementation of that agreement. The Claimants disagree with this contention, both as a matter of law and with respect to Armenia's factual predicate, namely that they purportedly made no cognizable contribution of resources following execution of the two Concessions. The Tribunal addresses below, first, the applicable legal standard, and then the application of that standard to the circumstances of this case.\n\n***(i) The objective meaning of \"investment\"***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nAs a starting point, the Tribunal agrees with Armenia that \u2013 by contrast with the consent requirement of Article 25(1), which examines the existence of the Parties' *subjective intent* to submit disputes to ICSID jurisdiction \u2013 Article 25(1)'s additional requirement that such disputes \"arise[] directly out of an investment\" involves an *objective* (rather than subjective) assessment. The two inquiries cannot be collapsed into one.500 Stated otherwise, parties to a contract or treaty do not have unlimited discretion under the ICSID Convention to define as an \"investment\" a transaction that objectively has no such nature.501 This is consistent with the 1965 Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention, which stated that \"[w]hile consent of the parties is an essential prerequisite for the jurisdiction of the Centre, consent alone will not suffice to bring a dispute within its jurisdiction. In keeping with the purpose of the Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre is further limited by reference to the nature of the dispute and the parties thereto.\"502\n\nThe separateness of the inquiry, requiring satisfaction of the ICSID Convention's requirements as well as the requirements of the underlying treaty or other instrument of consent, has often been described as a \"double keyhole\" or \"two-fold\" approach. *See, e.g.,* RL-74, *KT Asia*, n.58 (citing cases).\n\n*See, e.g.,* RL-12, *CSOB*, \u00b6 68; RL-37, *RSM*, \u00b6 235; RL-73, *Joy Mining*, \u00b6 50.\n\nCL-130, Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of Other States, 18 March 1965, \u00b6 25.\n\n370.\n\nAccordingly, ICSID tribunals may not simply defer to subjective characterizations by the parties; they must undertake their own independent review of the asset that is purported to qualify as an investment, to confirm that it meets the objective definition of that term. At the same time, tribunals should not lightly conclude that a dispute which the parties subjectively intended to be placed before ICSID for resolution lacks the essential characteristics of investment to permit it to be entertained. The Tribunal accepts that a joint stipulation that a given asset should qualify as an investment ordinarily will give rise to a presumption that it objectively does so, but that presumption remains subject to rebuttal in appropriate circumstances.503\n\n*See* RL-19, *Georg Gavrilovic and Gavrilovic D.O.O. v. Republic of Croatia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/39, Award, 26 July 2018 (\"***Gavrilovic***\"), \u00b6 192 (concluding that the judgment of BIT parties as to which economic activities constitute investments \"should be given considerable weight and deference,\" and that a tribunal \"would need compelling reasons to disregard such a mutually agreed definition of investment\"); CL-75, *Inmaris*, \u00b6 130 (same); CL-78, *RSM*, \u00b6\u00b6 236, 238 (\"the agreement to the jurisdiction of ICSID in a transaction between a state and a foreign private party thus can be viewed as a presumption that the transaction is indeed an investment \u2026. [O]nly where the economics of the disputed transaction are clearly lacking one or more of the recognized characteristics of an investment should an ICSID tribunal decline to enforce the parties' will and find that it has no jurisdiction\u2026.\").\n\n371.\n\nThus, while the ICSID Convention does not contain any express definition of \"investment,\" this does not mean, as Claimants contend, that the term should be deemed co-extensive with the meaning that parties to a given contract or treaty choose to ascribe to it.504 Rather, the lack of an express definition simply leaves the term \"investment\" in the ICSID Convention to be interpreted like any other undefined term in a treaty, namely in accordance with VCLT interpretative principles (including ordinary meaning, context and object and purpose).505\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 467 (arguing that the absence of an express definition of investment \"was precisely in order to defer to Contracting State parties' discretion in referring disputes to ICSID\").\n\n*See* RL-74, *KT Asia*, \u00b6 165; RL-35, *Quiborax*, \u00b6 212.\n\n372.\n\nImportantly, the same proposition \u2013 that the term \"investment\" has an objective, inherent meaning for purposes of the ICSID Convention \u2013 also applies to the term as used in the BIT at issue in this case. That conclusion flows from the structure of the BIT's definition of investment, which begins in Article I(1)(a) with a *circular statement* (that \"'investment' means every kind of investment\"), before providing an *illustrative but non-exhaustive list* of assets (\"such as \u2026; and includes \u2026\").506 The clear implication of the latter step is that the Contracting Parties to the BIT expected that assets falling within the list would have characteristics that satisfied their understanding of the word \"investment\" that preceded the list. Since one of the examples given is \"investment contracts,\" this aspect of the text gives rise to a presumption (as stated above) that such contracts entered into with a State, by entities \"owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party,\" will be entitled to the BIT's protections. In the great majority of cases, this will be the end of the matter, because there will be no dispute about whether a particular investment agreement was based on or led to the making of any actual contribution by the investor.\n\nArticle I(1)(a) of the BIT.\n\n373.\n\nHowever, jurisprudence often involves the examination of atypical and disputed circumstances. In such circumstances, it must be recognized that the existence of an illustrative list of assets in a BIT, and a presumption of a cognizable investment when a particular asset is included in that list, is not conclusive. Presumptions can be rebutted if the evidence warrants, and specifically, a BIT's illustrative list of assets expected to qualify as investments cannot trump the objective, ordinary meaning of the word \"investment.\" This is both because words in a treaty do have an ordinary meaning, which VCLT Article 31 requires to be taken into account, and because of the very fact that the list of assets in Article I(1)(a) is framed as non-exclusive. The latter point was well explained in a case that was discussed in several of the Parties' cited authorities, *Romak v. Uzbekistan*.507 As the *Romak* tribunal and others have observed, unless the term \"investment\" is given some inherent meaning, the non-exclusive nature of the asset list in most BITs provides no benchmark by which a tribunal could evaluate the qualifications of other forms of assets outside the illustrative list.508 Without any such benchmark, the circularity of the rest of Article I(1)(a)'s definition of \"investment\" (that the term \"'investment' means every kind of investment\") provides no guidance whatsoever as to the evaluation of non-listed assets. The same is true for the common formulation in other BITs, which defines \"investment\" sweepingly as \"every kind of asset.\" Unless some intrinsic meaning is assigned to the term, such general formulations risk permitting even transactions that bear none of the traditional hallmarks of investment to qualify as such.509\n\n*Romak S.A. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA280, Award, 26 November 2009 (\"***Romak***\") (discussed in RL-74, *KT Asia*, \u00b6\u00b6 165-66; see also RL-35, *Quiborax*, \u00b6\u00b6 198, 216; RL-76, *Orascom*, \u00b6 496).\n\n*See Romak*, \u00b6\u00b6 178-180 (rejecting claimant's argument that it \"should simply confirm that [its] assets fall within one or more of the categories listed,\" because this approach would \"deprive[] the term 'investments' of any inherent meaning,\" an outcome which is inconsistent with the non-exhaustive nature of the categories enumerated; the tribunal explained that \"there may well exist categories different from those mentioned in the list,\" and \"[a]ccordingly, there must be a benchmark against which to assess those non-listed assets \u2026 in order to determine whether they constitute an 'investment' within the meaning of\" the BIT).\n\n*See Romak*, \u00b6\u00b6 184-185 (explaining that a \"mechanical application of the categories listed\" in the BIT \"would eliminate any practical limitation to the scope of the concept of 'investment,\" and \"render meaningless the distinction between investments, on the one hand, and purely commercial transactions on the other\"); RL-19, *Gavrilovic*, \u00b6 193 (suggesting that \"the *Salini* test may be useful in certain circumstances; for instance, where a tribunal is concerned that a BIT or contract definition of investment is so broad and overreaching as to capture transactions that manifestly are not investments under any acceptable conception\").\n\n374.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the word \"investment\" must be given an inherent, objective meaning, for purposes not only of the ICSID Convention (which contains no definition of the term), but also of the BIT (which contains only an illustrative list of assets, with no stated guidance as to what shared characteristics bring the listed assets, and potentially other non-listed assets, within the qualifying term).\n\n375.\n\nBeginning with the VCLT command to look to the \"ordinary meaning\" of the term, the Tribunal observes that according to common dictionary definitions, the noun \"investment\" means variously:\n\n\u2022 the outlay of money usually for income or profit: capital outlay\"510;\n\n\u2022 \"the act of putting money, effort, time, etc. into something to make a profit or get an advantage, or the money, effort, time, etc. used to do this\"511; or\n\n\u2022 \"the act of investing money in something,\" or \"the money that you invest, or the thing that you invest in.\"512\n\nMerriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/invest.\n\nCambridge Dictionary, https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/invested.\n\nOxford Learner's Dictionaries, https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/american\\_english/invest.\n\n376.\n\nIn other words, inherent in the ordinary meaning of \"investment\" is some *contribution of resources* which is made in an attempt to earn a return over *a period of time*, a process that necessarily involves the possibility or *risk* of not earning a return. Many other tribunals, employing similar \"ordinary meaning\" analyses, have found these three basic elements to be inherent in any objective definition of \"investment.\" Although some tribunals have reached this conclusion solely through an analysis of the ICSID Convention, others have stated \u2013 as does this Tribunal \u2013 that the same interpretation of the word \"investment\" applies independently to investment treaties, whether or not a case is proceeding at ICSID.513\n\n*See, e.g.,* RL-74, *KT Asia*, \u00b6\u00b6 164-166 (observing that the claimant was right not to even argue that \"the mere fact of holding an asset which falls within the scope of [the BIT's illustrative list] is sufficient to conclude that a person has made an investment under the BIT,\" because the word \"investment\" has an inherent ordinary meaning, \"irrespective of the application of the ICSID Convention\"; that meaning \"presuppose[s] \u2026 a commitment of resources,\" without which \"the asset belonging to the claimant cannot constitute an investment within the meaning of \u2026 the BIT\"); RL-35, *Quiborax*, \u00b6 215 (noting cases concluding that \"the objective meaning was inherent to the term investment, irrespective of the application of the ICSID Convention\"); *Romak,* \u00b6 207 (\"The term 'investment' has a meaning in itself that cannot be ignored when considering the list contained in \u2026 the BIT,\" because the term in the BIT \"has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk \u2026\"); RL-76, *Orascom*, \u00b6 372 (\"the use of the term 'investment' in both the ICSID Convention and the BIT imports the same basic economic attributes of an investment derived from the ordinary meaning of that term, which comprises a contribution or allocation of resources, duration, and risk\").\n\n377.\n\nLooking beyond the ordinary meaning of Article 1(1)(a), do any other provisions of the BIT (forming the relevant \"context\" for VCLT purposes) cast further light on the intended scope and interpretation of the term \"investments\"? The preamble of the BIT sets forth its object and purpose, which is \"to promote greater economic cooperation between\" the United States and Armenia \"with respect to investment by nationals and companies of one Party in the territory of the other Party, in recognition that \"agreement upon the treatment to be accorded such investment will stimulate the flow of private capital and the economic development of the Parties.\" The reference to \"investment *by*\" nationals and companies \"*in* the territory\" of the host State, together with the reference to capital flows leading to economic development, tends to affirm that the purpose of the BIT was to encourage and protect investments in the ordinary sense, namely those that involved some actual making of contributions. The same is true for the preamble of the ICSID Convention, which refers in its first sentence to \"the need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein.\" Nothing in either preamble suggests an intent on the part of the drafters to protect transactions that do not involve the making of any contribution of value by the putative investor, or any assumption by it of a concomitant risk that its contribution will not be returned.\n\n378.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Tribunal finds that the objective definition of \"investment\" requires some contribution of resources of cognizable value. For avoidance of doubt, however, this notion of value is focused on whether the resources contributed are of a *nature that could be expected* to be of value, not on whether such contributions *ultimately achieved* any benefits for the host State's development. While certain States have suggested that a contribution to host State development is an additional requirement of the objective definition of investment, the Tribunal does not agree. Rather, it agrees with the *KT Asia* tribunal that, while \"such a contribution may well be the consequence of a successful investment \u2026 if the investment fails, and thus makes no contribution at all to the host State's economy, that cannot mean that there has been no investment\" in the first place.514\n\nRL-74, *KT Asia*, \u00b6 171; *see also* RL-35, *Quiborax*, \u00b6\u00b6 220-225 (citing other cases).\n\n***(ii) Whether Claimants made a \"contribution of resources\"***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nWith this understanding of the applicable legal standard, the Tribunal turns to the facts of this case. There is no dispute that Armenia entered into two \"investment contracts\" with Rasia, as those terms are used in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT: namely, the Road Concession and the Railway Concession. Nor is there any dispute that the two Concessions envisioned the eventual design, build, operation and maintenance in Armenia of (respectively) a functioning high speed road and a railway in Southern Armenia. Both of these infrastructure developments, if eventually delivered, would have been considerable contributions. There is likewise no dispute that Mr. Borkowski (a U.S. national) owned and controlled Rasia, such that any cognizable contribution Rasia made in Armenia towards fulfillment of the Concessions would qualify under the BIT as an investment \"owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals \u2026 of the other Party \u2026.\"515\n\nArticle I(1)(a) of the BIT (emphasis added).\n\n380.\n\nIn other words, the dispute does not turn on whether the course of works *envisioned* by the two Concessions would involve contributions that would satisfy the objective definition of investment in both the ICSID Convention and the BIT. That much appears to be agreed. Rather, the question is whether, beyond the \"words on the paper\" (*i.e.*, the Concession Agreements themselves), the Claimants *actually made* any contributions following execution of the Concessions.\n\n381.\n\nIn Armenia's view, the Claimants cannot qualify as having made any \"investment\" within the objective definition of that term, because they did not pay anything to obtain the Concession Agreements, did not establish a legal entity within Armenia to implement the Concessions, and did not provide evidence of any actual expenditure related to either Project.516 By contrast, the Claimants assert that the Concession Agreements themselves satisfy the meaning of \"investment,\" and even if a further contribution of resources is required, this was satisfied (a) by the Claimants' \"financing and procurement of the Feasibility Studies,\" with the related risk that such studies would conclude that one or both Projects were not feasible,517 and (b) more generally, by the Claimants' various efforts to implement the Concession Agreements, including their arranging for work to be done by others (*e.g.,* CCCC) whom Claimants analogize to \"subcontractors.\"518 The Claimants contend that these efforts were of meaningful value and cannot be ignored, particularly in circumstances where the success of the Projects was ultimately stymied (in Claimants' view) by Armenia's conduct rather than by their own.\n\nResp.

Section 66.3 of both Concessions stipulates that \"the transaction to which this Agreement relates is an investment\" for purposes of the ICSID Convention.519 Claimants equate this statement to an agreement by Armenia, in advance, that the Convention's \"investment\" requirement would be satisfied *by the Concessions* themselves, which (as \"investment contracts\") constitute assets that fall within the BIT's express list of those entitled to protection.520 Armenia emphasizes instead Section 66.3's reference to a \"*transaction*\" to which each Concession \"*relates*,\" and argues that this envisions some post-Concession commitment of resources to implement the Concessions, before any \"investment\" could be said to have been made for purposes of the ICSID Convention.521\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Article XVII, Section 66.3; C-2, Road Concession, Article XVII, Section 66.3.\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6 295.\n\nResp. Second PHB \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n\n383.\n\nThe fact that this is even a debate reinforces the unusual nature of this case. The Tribunal expects that in most cases involving major concession contracts with a State, the concessionaire will have no difficulty evidencing some outlay of funds, either to *obtain* its qualifying investment (*e.g.,* the purchase of shares in a local company or title to local assets), or to *enhance the value or functioning* of the investment it holds (*e.g.,* the injection of funds into a local company or operation). What makes this case unusual, among other things, is that the Claimants have presented no evidence of any kind regarding out of pocket expenditures.\n\n384.\n\nThe closest the Claimants have come to claiming an actual financial contribution in connection with the Concessions is the assertion that Rasia undertook contractually to reimburse CCCC, in the amount of US$15 million, for the two Feasibility Studies that CCCC prepared initially at its own expense. This arrangement was documented in the CCCC Road Commercial Agreement and the CCCC Railway Commercial Agreement, both of which were agreed to form an integral part of the broader Rasia-CCCC Framework Agreement, which envisioned CCCC's eventual retention as lead EPC contractor for the Projects.522 The Claimants describe this arrangement as Rasia having \"financed the Feasibility Studies through a secured loan,\"523 and contend that Rasia's assumption of this contractual liability for the costs of the Feasibility Studies qualifies as a contribution of resources. Armenia focuses, by contrast, on the fact that after the Projects' collapse, CCCC never called upon Rasia's debt, so accordingly Rasia has paid nothing yet \u2013 and in the absence of payment, CCCC rather than Rasia continues to own any intellectual property delivered to Armenia through the Feasibility Studies. Armenia further disputes that CCCC ever will call on Rasia's debt, casting doubt on the *bona fides* of the 2018-2021 Borkowski-Weixin correspondence which purports to confirm the continued existence of the debt, notwithstanding CCCC's decision to defer calling on it.524\n\nR-68, Commercial Agreement for Feasibility Study on the Southern Armenia High Speed Road, 10 December 2012, \u00b6 4 & Appendix 1; R-67, Commercial Agreement for Feasibility Study on the Southern Armenia Railway, 10 December 2012.\n\nCl.

The correspondence was not issued in the ordinary course of dealings between the Parties; rather, CCCC was told the letters were required only for purposes of an audit that Rasia was facing.526 The Claimants have not presented any documentary evidence of such an audit, and Mr. Borkowski's testimony regarding these events was far from persuasive. In any event, the correspondence on its face does not reflect any effort by CCCC to collect on the debt from Rasia. At best, the wording that Mr. Weixin accepted (based on Mr. Borkowski's draft) indicates that CCCC had chosen to defer any decision to call the debt, initially because it was waiting for the EPC contracts to materialize,527 and later because of this pending Arbitration and the \"sensitivity of bilateral government relations between China and Armenia as well as China and the UAE.\"528 The latter reference, referring to important political sensitivities, casts doubt on the general statement in one of the ghostwritten letters that \"CCCC will, in due course, seek repayment.\"529 The Tribunal does not accept that this correspondence demonstrates any real intent by CCCC ever to call on the debt. The record is also devoid of any demonstration that Rasia would have had the wherewithal to pay.\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6 164 (citing Tr. 480:11-21; C-350, Email from J Borkowski to Mr. B.

To the contrary, so long as the arrangement did not involve any expectation that *it* would be asked to pay anything for the Feasibility Studies, Armenia's interests would appear unaffected by any internal payment arrangements as between Rasia and the third party (CCCC) that Rasia retained, with Armenia's knowledge, to prepare these technical reports.\n\nCl. Second PHB \u00b6 32.\n\nC-23, \"Ambassador of China: It Will Be Possible to Speak of Expediency of Iran-Armenia Project after Preparation of Feasibility Study\" (ArmInfo), 16 November 2015 (public remarks by the Chinese Ambassador to Armenia, during a joint event attended by Armenian officials to discuss the Railway Project, that \"Chinese companies are conducting the feasibility study of the project on a non-repayable basis\"; the press article reporting this statement referred specifically to a feasibility study developed \"[i]n cooperation with Dubai-based investment company, Rasia FZE\").\n\n387.\n\nCertainly, had the Feasibility Studies proved *substantively* satisfactory to Armenia,532 allowing the Projects to move forward to the next stage, Armenia would have benefited from the technical work reflected therein, (a) regardless of whether Rasia had paid for the work upfront or incurred a contractual obligation to pay for it later, and (b) regardless of whether CCCC later called on that debt. Rasia's contribution in that scenario might have been *qualitative* (delivering technical studies that it had arranged for CCCC to prepare) rather than *quantitative* (paying for the underlying work), but it nonetheless would have been a provision of value to the Projects. The fact that, as it transpired, the Feasibility Studies were not satisfactory to Armenia, and that the Projects did not move forward for that and a number of other reasons, is a matter for the merits. It cannot be permitted, with 20-20 hindsight, to erase the fact that Rasia arranged, through its efforts, for the preparation and delivery of two lengthy Feasibility Studies at no cost whatsoever to Armenia.\n\nClaimants argue that notwithstanding Armenia's criticisms of the Feasibility Study, Armenia until recently has \"continued to use\" them to attract new investors. Cl. Second PHB \u00b6 27. Respondent contests this proposition. The Tribunal does not consider this debate necessary to the resolution of the jurisdictional issue.\n\n388.\n\nThis analysis in turn introduces a broader question: as a matter of law, does a contribution by a putative investor have to be *monetary in nature*, in order to satisfy the objective definition of investment in the ICSID Convention and the BIT? Armenia appears to suggest that it does, in arguing that the absence of any outlay of funds by Rasia is conclusive of the absence of any contribution.533 The Tribunal is not convinced, however, that this necessarily is the case. First, the phrase used in most cases discussing the requirement of a contribution to establish an investment is that there must have been a \"*commitment of resources*\"534; textually, this is not necessarily limited to an expenditure of money. To the contrary, various tribunals have suggested, albeit sometimes in *dicta*, that an investment can be created through the contribution of non-monetary resources.535 The Tribunal considers this approach reasonable, so long as the contribution of such resources is of a nature expected to meaningfully advance the project in question. Among other things, this approach is consistent with at least some of the dictionary definitions of \"investment\" which help to illustrate the ordinary meaning of the term.536\n\n*See, e.g.,* Resp.

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/2, Award, 31 October 2012, \u00b6 297 (referring to the possibility of investment through contribution of \"know-how, equipment, personnel and resources,\" as referenced in several of the Parties' cited authorities, *e.g.*, RL-13, *Doutremepuich*, \u00b6 125); *Romak*, \u00b6 214 (interpreting the term \"contribution\" to include \"[a]ny dedication of resources that has economic value, whether in the form of financial obligations, services, technology, patents, or technical assistance \u2026In other words, a 'contribution' can be made in cash, kind or labor.\").\n\n*See, e.g.*, Cambridge Dictionary, https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/invested (referring to non-monetary contributions as one of the forms an investment can take: \"the act of putting money, *effort, time*, etc. into something to make a profit or get an advantage, or the money, *effort, time*, etc. used to do this\") (emphasis added).\n\n389.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the sufficiency of a particular form of contribution made by a given investor must be assessed, at least in part, against the expectations that the State contemporaneously had of that investor \u2013 at least in the context where the State entered into a concession contract or similar investment agreement precisely to regulate their respective obligations. In this case, it is notable that the preamble to both Concession Agreements recited that the Government of Armenia \"deems it advantageous to have private sector participation in the improvement of its transportation infrastructure so as to benefit from private sector know-how, business connections and capital.\"537 According to this sentence, Armenia evidently considered that each of these contributions \u2013 including the deployment of \"private sector know-how\" and \"business connections,\" in addition to the expenditure of \"capital\" \u2013 would provide a \"benefit,\" in the sense of helping to advance the development of two highly complex, long-term, multi-step transportation infrastructure projects.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Preamble; C-2, Road Concession, Section 12(d), Preamble.\n\n390.\n\nAs to which of these benefits Rasia itself would provide, as opposed to arranging for others to provide, the record also reflects that from the outset (predating the Concession Agreements), Rasia's role in the Projects was described as that of \"Sponsor.\"538 Logically, that role involved the responsibility to coordinate the deployment of a range of technical and financial services in support of the Projects. There is no evidence, however, that Armenia believed Rasia *itself* (much less Mr. Borkowski personally) had either the technical or the financial resources to perform or finance the design, build, operation and maintenance work envisioned by the Concession Agreements. To the contrary, the Concession Agreements seemed to envision that Rasia would arrange the provision of \"private sector know-how \u2026 and capital\" by third parties, presumably utilizing the \"business connections\" which the preamble of both Agreements described as a distinct \"benefit\" that also would be \"advantageous\" for the Government to receive.539\n\nC-52, Framework Agreement, p. 1.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Preamble; C-2, Road Concession, Section 12(d), Preamble.\n\n391.\n\nWith respect to technical know-how, this understanding is express in both Concessions, which obligated Rasia to supply \"[f]easibility studies prepared by one or more first-class specialized firms.\"540 There is no suggestion in this passage that Armenia understood Rasia itself to be a \"specialized firm\" in the construction of either roads or railways, so this passage necessarily envisioned that Rasia's role was to procure and supply suitable feasibility studies from third parties. That procurement in turn constituted an important part of Rasia's expected contribution under the Concessions. With respect to capital, Armenia was aware even before the Concessions of Rasia's plan to seek backing from Aabar, the U.A.E.'s sovereign wealth fund.541 The Concessions themselves acknowledged that \"in addition to any equity investment that Rasia FZE is willing to arrange,\" the Projects implied at least 75% debt financing through secured lending, \"without which implementation of the project may not be feasible\" for Rasia.542 In other words, there was no expectation that Rasia itself would be a primary source of funds, although the Concessions did refer generally to Rasia's implementing the Projects \"from its own funds and attracted project finance.\"543\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 9(d); C-1, Railway Concession, Section 9(e).\n\n*See, e.g.*, C-11, Letter from Mr. C. Tappendorf, Aabar to Minister G. Beglaryan, 26 June 2012.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Preamble; C-2, Road Concession, Section 12(d), Preamble.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 3(b); C-1, Railway Concession, Section 3(b).\n\n392.\n\nIt was precisely because Rasia was to draw on the services of third parties that the Concessions expressly authorized it to adopt a \"consortium approach\" for both financing and development, under which it \"will likely attract investors, international financial institutions, institutional and other lenders,\" as well as \"first-class specialized developers\" for building and operating the Road and Railway.544 At the same time, the Concessions were quite clear that Rasia \"shall always remain fully liable before the Government for the performance of obligations under this Agreement,\"545 regardless of how many third parties it might pull together to achieve the considerable deliverables Rasia promised to Armenia.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 5; C-2, Road Concession, Section 5.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 5; C-2, Road Concession, Section 5.\n\n393.\n\nIn other words, even if Rasia's main contribution as \"Sponsor\" was expected to be its use of \"business connections\" to pull together the required specialized know-how and capital of others, the Parties accepted that this role involved its directly undertaking substantial risk. The Concession Agreements each explicitly recognized that Rasia would \"assume substantial financial and commercial risks in connection with the implementation of the Project.\"546 Such risks were particularly pronounced for long-term infrastructure projects as ambitious as these two Projects, which involved obligations that would take years to implement and were susceptible of failure at numerous junctures.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 15; C-2, Road Concession, Section 15.\n\n394.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the debate between the Parties about whether Rasia had made any *monetary* contributions to the implementation of the Projects, by the time the Projects fell apart, does not capture the full picture of its expected role. The nature of that role encompassed expected substantial contributions of a non-monetary nature as well. Having contracted for such non-monetary contributions, including specifically Rasia's use of its \"business connections\" to offer Armenia the \"advantage[s]\" of specialized know-how and capital from third parties, it would not be appropriate to find that Rasia made no cognizable investment, simply because it has not demonstrated any out-of-pocket outlay during the period before the two Projects fell apart.\n\n395.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that there are serious questions about whether Rasia ever managed to *successfully* deliver on any of the other contributions it promised, separate from the issue of monetary contributions. There is debate, for example, over the compliance of the two Feasibility Studies with the Concessions' requirements. There is debate also about whether Rasia ever obtained, or ever had the realistic prospect of obtaining, actual financial commitments in support of the two Projects. But that debate cannot be answered without venturing deeply into the merits of the dispute, to determine whether either party to the Concessions ultimately performed as promised and if not, why not.\n\n396.\n\nFor purposes of the jurisdictional analysis, there is no question, at the most basic level, that both Rasia and its principal Mr. Borkowski did expend significant *effort* attempting to implement the Projects547 \u2013 or at least some form of road and railway projects, if not precisely the form reflected in the Concessions. The record reflects substantial effort by Rasia and Mr. Borkowski, expended over a period of several years. This includes not only its negotiations with CCCC and Aabar, but also efforts to broker agreements with railway operators from bordering countries (such as Iran), which was a further obligation that Rasia undertook under the Concessions.548 Given that these efforts were deployed in attempted implementation of Rasia's main role under the Concessions \u2013 that of \"Sponsor,\" procuring and coordinating deliverables from various other actors \u2013 it would be odd to conclude that the steps taken were not of a nature that the Parties (at the time) understood as having cognizable value to the Projects as a whole.\n\nThe Claimants describe this as investing \"time, energy, resources and reputation.\" Cl. Mem. \u00b6 254.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 9(b).\n\n397.\n\nSuch a conclusion would be particularly odd in the context of these Concessions, under which Armenia and Rasia expressly agreed to submit any disputes over performance to ICSID arbitration for resolution. It must be recalled that the ICSID Convention was negotiated at a time when investment contracts (and not investment treaties) were expected to be the principal form in which consent to ICSID jurisdiction was expressed. The Tribunal has been shown nothing in either the wording or history of the Convention to suggest that its drafters intended ICSID tribunals to reject jurisdiction over disputes about investment contract performance, in circumstances where both the State and its contract partner expressly agreed that they should exercise jurisdiction, simply because the disputes arose early in the implementation of contractual performance, at a juncture when the \"contributions\" of the partner were still relatively inchoate and comparatively minor to what was ultimately envisaged to result from the contract's implementation. Provided that some efforts were undertaken to implement contractual performance,549 consistent with the basic obligations the contractual party was expected to perform, a tribunal in these circumstances should not lightly set aside the parties' specific agreement to submit disputes to ICSID arbitration.\n\nThe Tribunal distinguishes this situation from that in *Romak*, where the parties executed a \"Protocol of Intention\" under which claimant pledged to perform certain services for Uzbekistan, but in fact \"made no contribution in furtherance of the Protocol of Intention, which \u2026 seems never to have evolved from the status of a mere statement of aspiration and was never acted upon by the Parties.\" *Romak*, \u00b6 214.\n\n398.\n\nFor these reasons, and in the very particular context of these Concession Agreements, the Tribunal concludes that Rasia's efforts to implement the transactions contemplated by those Agreements were a minimally sufficient \"contribution of resources\" (albeit in non-monetary form) to constitute an investment for purposes of the ICSID Convention. Armenia's objection *ratione materiae* is therefore denied.\n\n**B.

The Claimants do not dispute the Respondent's umbrella clause objection regarding Rasia.\n\n405.\n\nFirst, the Claimants argue that while Mr. Borkowski's entitlement to invoke the umbrella clause of the BIT is a substantive rather than a jurisdictional issue,558 he may do so, regardless of the fact that he is not personally a party to the Concessions. That is because, under Article II(2)(c) of the BIT, Armenia undertook to \"observe any obligation it may have entered with regard to investments.\"559 Accordingly, the issue before the Tribunal is whether Article II(2)(c) of the BIT confers rights on Mr. Borkowski, for the determination of which, the Tribunal must interpret the clause in accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT.560\n\nCl.

It offers protection against the breach of any obligation entered into \"with regard to investments,\" including contracts entered into by the State, the Claimants say.562 Furthermore, there is no privity requirement under the provision; the threshold is whether Armenia entered into any obligation \"with regard to investments\" and not whether the investor himself entered into the obligations in question. The Claimants argue that in *Enron*, the tribunal held that the phrase \"any obligation\" refers to obligations regardless of their nature, including contractual obligations. Those obligations are limited by their object: \"with regard to investments.\"563 In the Claimants' view, the type of undertaking covered by such a broad umbrella clause includes contracts entered into by the State.564\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 493.\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6 281.\n\n407.\n\nSecond, the Claimants submit that Armenia's obligations under the Concessions were entered into \"with regard to investments\" of Mr. Borkowski.565 They invoke the *EDF* tribunal's decision that EDF was entitled to assert an umbrella clause claim in respect of obligations owed to EDF's local subsidiary.566 The Claimants note that the umbrella clause in the *EDF* case was worded similarly to that in issue in this case \u2013 \"in connection with investments\" \u2013 and the tribunal's finding relied on that broad wording. This interpretation, according to the Claimants, was further confirmed by the tribunal in *Continental Casualty*,567 which held that umbrella clauses may apply to obligations in force between a State and the claimant's subsidiary.\n\nCl.

They argue that in that case, the applicable umbrella clause expressly provided that an agreement must exist between the investor and the host State. In the Claimants' view, the analysis of that clause is irrelevant in the present context, where the relevant umbrella clause has different wording.568\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 497.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nAs a threshold matter, there is no dispute between the Parties regarding Rasia, in connection with Article II(2)(c) of the BIT. Rasia is a U.A.E. company, and as such has no standing to invoke any of the substantive protections of the BIT, which protects only nationals of the United States and Armenia. Claimants do not contend otherwise. Accordingly, there is only one Claimant, Mr. Borkowski, who seeks to assert claims under the BIT, and whose authority to do so is disputed.\n\n410.\n\nMoreover, the resolution of this debate will have far less impact on the scope of the case than in most other cases where the reach of umbrella clauses has been disputed. That is because Mr. Borkowski's invocation of an Article II(2)(c) violation is articulated solely in connection with Armenia's alleged breach of its two Concessions with Rasia, and the Tribunal has already found that Rasia has jurisdiction to assert a breach of contract claim directly against Armenia, pursuant to the dispute resolution clauses of those Concessions. The Claimants have not suggested that Mr. Borkowski's umbrella clause claim under the BIT is any broader than Rasia's breach of contract claim under the Concessions. This is not a case, for example, where a foreign investor alleges that a State entered into *separate* obligations with respect to its investment, arising from commitments made outside the framework of a particular investment agreement.\n\n411.\n\nIn these circumstances, one might query the necessity even of deciding the disputed issue. The Tribunal accepts, however, that a party may have practical reasons for seeking to bring a treaty claim under its own name, even where that claim appears factually almost identical to a contract claim that its 100% subsidiary is already asserting. Claims brought under the two different legal instruments may (if successful) be subject to different enforcement regimes, and any relief obtained may (if collected by one claimant or the other569) be subject to different tax consequences. In any event, the fact remains that Mr. Borkowski has asserted an umbrella clause claim under the BIT, to which Armenia has objected as a matter of jurisdiction. Under the ICSID Convention, the Parties are entitled to a ruling with respect to that jurisdictional objection.\n\nIt goes without saying that there could be no valid basis for double recovery, both by a subsidiary on its contract claims and by its shareholder on umbrella clause claims.\n\n412.\n\nThe resolution of the issue dispute turns entirely on treaty interpretation. The relevant BIT clause, Article II(2)(c), is short. It provides in entirety as follows:\n\nEach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\n\n413.\n\nSome investment treaty tribunals have interpreted similar or identical clauses as giving standing to foreign investors to bring umbrella clause claims, even where the State \"obligations\" in question were \"entered into\" through contracts with the claimant's subsidiary rather than with the claimant itself. These tribunals have generally emphasized the breadth of the phrase \"*with regard to* investments\" (emphasis added). For example, the *Continental Casualty* tribunal held that \"provided that these obligations have been entered '*with regard*' to investments, they may have been entered with persons or entities other than foreign investors themselves, so that an undertaking by the host State with a subsidiary \u2026 is not in principle excluded.\"570 The *EDF* tribunal likewise reasoned, albeit under umbrella clauses that were worded somewhat differently,571 that \"[a] clear and ordinary reading of these dispositions covers \u2026 [c]oncession agreements granted to foreign investors for specific investments,\" even if the agreement in question was signed with a local subsidiary.572 The *EDF* decision survived an annulment challenge based on this finding, even though (as discussed below) an earlier decision in *CMS*, which likewise allowed a foreign investor to assert umbrella clause claims based on a State contract with its subsidiary, was annulled for failure to state reasons on this point.573\n\nCL-85, *Continental Casualty*, \u00b6 297 (emphasis added).\n\n*See* CL-84, *EDF*, \u00b6 938 (interpreting one clause that covered commitments \"undertaken with respect to investors of the other Party\" and another covering any \"commitment undertaken in connection with the investments made by nationals or companies from the other Contracting Party\"). On annulment, an ICSID *ad hoc* committee acknowledged that these clauses were different from those in the *CMS*, *Azurix* and *Burlington* cases discussed further below, which all involved clauses obligating each State to \"observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\" \u2013 the exact wording in the BIT before this Tribunal. However, the *EDF* annulment committee found the differences in wording to be inconsequential, and \"therefore proceeded on the basis that the umbrella clauses in the present case are substantially the same as those in the *CMS*, *Azurix* and *Burlington* cases.\" *See* RL-71, *EDF International S.A. et al. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Annulment Proceeding, Decision, 5 February 2016 (\"***EDF*** **Annulment Decision**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 270-273.\n\nCL-84, *EDF*, \u00b6 938. The *EDF* tribunal emphasized, in addition to the \"broadly worded\" form of the umbrella clause, that the contract with EDF's subsidiary made explicit mention of shareholders. *Id.*, \u00b6 942.\n\nRL-71, *EDF* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 264, 276-277 (distinguishing the *CMS* Annulment Decision on the basis that the *EDF* tribunal had sufficiently stated its reasoning, which emphasized both the respondent's dealings directly with the claimants \"as prospective foreign investors\" and \"the broad language of the umbrella clauses \u2026 which spoke of commitments undertaken (or entered into) with regard to *investments*, rather than with *investors*\") (emphasis in original).\n\n414.\n\nAnother argument commonly presented in support of allowing investors to assert umbrella clause claims asserting a breach of State contracts with their subsidiaries is that many BITs \u2013 like this one, in its Article 1(1)(a) \u2013 define \"investments\" as including those \"owned or controlled directly *or indirectly* by nationals \u2026 of the other Party\" (emphasis added). This was a point emphasized by Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a in his dissent in *Burlington*,574 which was cross-referenced in the majority decision discussed by the Parties.575 If this textual element is combined with the \"with regard to investments\" element emphasized in *Continental Casualty* and *EDF*, an argument could be made that the umbrella clause requires the host State to \"observe any obligation it may have entered into,\" not only *directly* with the foreign investor, but also \"*with regard to*\" the investor's *indirect* investments, *i.e.,* involving investments in the host State by companies that the investor owns or controls. In this case, there is no question that Mr. Borkowski qualifies as a \"national \u2026 of the other Party,\" nor that he owns and controls Rasia. Rasia in turn, entered into Concession Agreements, which anticipated that it would make investments in Armenia, and by which Armenia granted Rasia certain rights. The Claimants accordingly say that the Concession Agreements qualify as obligations that Armenia \"entered into *with regard to*\" Mr. Borkowski's indirect investment in Armenia, even though Armenia did not enter into the Concession Agreements directly \"*with*\" Mr. Borkowski.576\n\nDissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, *Burlington Resources Inc. v.

The Treaty does not make that distinction and if this had been the intention it would have had to be spelled out\u2026. It is the submission of this arbitrator that the right conclusion should have ben that the entity whose interest in the investment is protected under the treaty is also entitled to benefit from the protection of an umbrella clause devised to ensure the observance of obligations concerning that investment.

Reply \u00b6 493.\n\n415.\n\nHowever, a number of other awards have reached a contrary conclusion, based on a different reading of similar or identical umbrella clauses. First, in a ruling that was explained in a single paragraph, the *Azurix* tribunal concluded that since Argentina's contract was with Azurix's subsidiary rather than with Azurix itself, Azurix could not invoke the relevant umbrella clause, because \"there is no undertaking to be honored by Argentina to Azurix other than the obligations under the BIT.\"577 The same conclusion was reached the next year in the *Siemens* case, based on a similarly brief analysis.578 However, more textual analysis was provided in subsequent cases, first in the *CMS* Annulment Decision,579 and subsequently in the *Burlington* majority decision580 and the decision in *WNC Factoring*,581 both of which discussed the prior case law in some depth.\n\nCL-93, *Azurix Corp. v.

As the *CMS ad hoc* committee explained, obligations arising from contracts exist in a particular legal framework that is provided by their governing law. They \"are not entered into *erga omnes* but with regard to particular persons,\" such that performance is owed by a particular obligor to a particular obligee:\n\nThe effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into something else; the content of the obligation is unaffected, as is its proper law. If this is so, it would appear that the *parties* to the obligation (*i.e.*, the persons bound by it and entitled to rely on it) are likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella clause.582\n\nRL-14, *CMS* Annulment Decision, \u00b6 95.\n\n417.\n\nThe *Burlington* majority echoed this approach, stating that \"[t]he word 'obligation' is thus the operative term of the umbrella clause,\" and that \"[a]n obligation entails a party bound by it and another one benefitting from it, in other words, entails an obligor and an obligee. Second, an obligation does not exist in a vacuum,\" but requires \"municipal law to give it content.\" Yet under most systems of law, companies have independent legal personality, and \"the non-signatory parent of a contract party may [not] directly enforce its subsidiary's rights.\"583 As for the phrase \"entered into *with regard to* investments\" (emphasis added), while this denotes a \"link between the obligation and the investment,\" the link \"does not replace but qualifies\" the notion of obligation: -- and \"[i]f there is no obligation in the first place, there is nothing to qualify.\" The *Burlington* majority acknowledged that the definition of investment in the relevant treaty covered both direct and indirect investment, but it stated that this did not make the parent company a co-obligee of the State's obligations under the relevant contracts: \"Broad as the definition of investment in the Treaty may be, it cannot compensate for the absence of an 'obligation.'\"584\n\nRL-69, *Burlington*, \u00b6\u00b6 214-215.\n\nRL-69, *Burlington*, \u00b6\u00b6 216-217.\n\n418.\n\nIn *WNC Factoring*, the umbrella clause was quite different from the one in this case: it began by referring to \"specific agreements\" that \"[i]nvestors of the Contracting Party may conclude with the other Contracting Party,\" before stating that each Party \"shall, with regard the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, observe the provisions of these specific agreements.\" The tribunal found that this language limited a \"specific agreement\" to those a State concluded with an \"investor,\" defined as the qualifying foreign national, and that this *prima facie* excluded umbrella clause protection for agreements entered into with its subsidiaries.585 Nonetheless, the *WNC Factoring* tribunal went on to state that it would have found privity to be required even had it been faced with a more typical umbrella clause,586 because \"an undertaking\" is something owed to \"the identified beneficiary of the undertaking,\" and \"[u]nder international law, merely because a State may owe an obligation to observe an undertaking given to a company does not mean that the State also owes that same obligation \u2026 to that company's shareholders.\"587 After canvassing other decisions to similar effect (including *Azurix, Siemens,* the *CMS* Annulment Decision and *Burlington*),588 the *WNC Factoring* tribunal stated that it was not persuaded by the contrary reasoning of either *Continental Casualty* or *EDF*.589 In the tribunal's view, umbrella clauses \"are intended to give effect to legal commitments entered into by the host state with regard to investments, not to change their scope or content.\"590 It added that since the contract at issue \"imposes no obligation on the Claimant, the Claimant and the Respondent cannot be said to have a relationship of obligor and obligee.\"591\n\nRL-48, *WNC Factoring*, \u00b6\u00b6 317-318, 320.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 335 (\"If it were necessary to do so, the Tribunal would uphold the requirement of privity even for generally worded umbrella clauses\").\n\nRL-48, *WNC Factoring*, \u00b6\u00b6 322-323.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 325-329, 336-337. The tribunal considered these cases to reflect \"the dominant view \u2026 that in respect of contractual obligations, only parties entitled to enforce the obligation under the proper law of the contract may sue,\" resulting in a \"requirement of privity under umbrella clauses.\" *Id.*, \u00b6 325.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 331-333 (discussing *Continental Casualty*), \u00b6\u00b6 338-339 (discussing *EDF*).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 335.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 339. This point about reciprocity of obligations echoed another concern of the *CMS ad hoc* Committee with the broad interpretation the *CMS* tribunal had rendered of the umbrella clause. Specifically, the Committee observed that \"[t]he obligation of the State covered by [the umbrella clause] will often be a bilateral obligation, or will be intrinsically linked to obligations of the investment company. Yet a shareholder, although apparently entitled to enforce the company's rights in its own interest, will not be bound by the company's obligations, *e.g.* as to dispute settlement.\" RL-14, *CMS* Annulment Decision, \u00b6 95(d).\n\n419.\n\nSome critics of the \"contractual privity\" decisions have suggested that by denying a foreign investor the ability to assert an umbrella clause claim arising from a State's alleged breach of a contract with its subsidiary, the \"privity\" approach undermines the object and purpose of BITs. This is said particularly to be the case in circumstances where the host State required the foreign investor to invest *through a local company*, which accordingly could not on its own invoke umbrella clause protections.592 That particular concern has no relevance here, where Rasia is not an Armenian company, and there is no evidence that Armenia expressed any preferences at all regarding the nationality of its Concession counterparty. Presumably, it was Mr. Borkowski who chose to pursue the Concessions through a U.A.E.-incorporated company, rather than incorporating (for example) a U.S. company for that purpose. In any event, as certain cases have noted,593 the object and purpose of BITs must be read holistically, and they would hardly be defeated by the \"privity\" approach to umbrella clauses, when other treaty protections indisputably may be invoked by foreign shareholders without concern for contractual privity.\n\n*See, e.g., Burlington* Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10 (reasoning that \"[w]hen the use of such vehicles or local companies is required by the host State by means of legislation or regulation,\" it becomes \"imperative\" to conclude that the foreign investor is also entitled to benefit from the protection of an umbrella clause. \"An interpretation to the effect that only the corporate entity having signed the contract can rely on the protection of the umbrella clause will inevitably lead to a negation of the protection in question depriving the treaty of all meaning in this context.\"); *cf.* RL-48, *WNC Factoring*, \u00b6 340 (noting Claimant's argument that a restrictive interpretation of the umbrella clause would enable a State \"to circumvent the BIT by prescribing domestic incorporation\" as a condition of a transaction, but rejecting that argument: \"as the seller in an open tender process, the Respondent was free to impose such a condition, and any potential bidder was free not to bid on those terms. It cannot be said that, if a foreign investor voluntarily enters into an agreement which is clearly excluded from the plain terms of an umbrella clause, there is a manifestly absurd result.\").\n\n*See, e.g.,* RL-69, *Burlington*, \u00b6 218 (\"The umbrella clause is only one of the various substantive protections that the Treaty bestows upon investors, with the scope of protection depending on the terms of each specific provision. Other Treaty provisions unquestionably protect both direct and indirect investments, such as for instance the expropriation clause. The object and purpose of the Treaty do not impose that all standards of protection have the same scope.\"); RL-48, *WNC Factoring*, \u00b6 340 (noting that the privity approach to umbrella clauses \"would not preclude the investor from recourse to other protections open to it *qua* investor under the BIT\").\n\n420.\n\nIn the end, the Tribunal is faced with a BIT provision which (under other BITs with identical language) has been interpreted in two very different ways. The Tribunal agrees with the *EDF* Annulment Decision that both approaches are \"arguable,\" and that in these circumstances a conclusion in either direction cannot be considered a manifest excess of powers.594 On balance, however, the Tribunal considers the approach reflected by the *Burlington* majority to represent the more natural and convincing interpretation of Article II(2)(c). In particular, the Tribunal is persuaded that every contract must be considered within the legal regime from which it derives its existence and with specific regard to the identity of the parties to the contract. Mr. Borkowski was not a co-obligor or a co-obligee of Rasia under the Concessions, and he derived no rights either to enforce them or to have them enforced against him. On this basis, the Concessions cannot be said to be obligations that Armenia \"entered into\" with Mr. Borkowski. As for the reference in Article II(2)(c) to \"obligation[s] \u2026 entered into *with regard to investments*,\" the Tribunal observes that Mr. Borkowski's investment was in the shares of Rasia, a U.A.E. company. There is no suggestion that Armenia entered into (much less breached) any obligations with regard to such shares. Rather, Armenia entered into obligations with regard to Rasia's potential investments in Armenia, not Mr. Borkowski's investment in Rasia.\n\nRL-71, *EDF* Annulment Decision, \u00b6 279.\n\n421.\n\nThe Tribunal of course accepts that a shareholder's status as an indirect investor in a host State will often entitle it to bring other types of investment treaty claims in its own right. Mr. Borkowski accordingly has standing to assert, in his own name, the other Treaty claims he pleads: fair and equitable treatment, arbitrary measures, and indirect expropriation. But umbrella clauses are generally different, in that they *posit a key precondition*, in the form of an \"obligation\" that the host State \"entered into\" through an instrument (generally a contract) *other* than the investment treaty itself. Absent unusual treaty language, a shareholder who has no rights under such a contract, under that contract's own governing law, may not step into the shoes of the contracting entity for purposes of an umbrella clause, collapsing all corporate formalities established under the governing law and claiming contractual benefits directly for its own account.\n\n422.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent's objection that Mr. Borkowski has no standing under the Treaty to assert a claim under Article II(2)(c) with regard to the contractual obligations that Armenia entered into with Rasia. Hypothetically, if there were an applicable U.A.E.-Armenia BIT that contained a comparable umbrella clause, then Rasia might well have standing to bring an umbrella clause claim in its own name for breach of obligations that Armenia \"entered into with regard to\" its investments, namely the Concessions. But Mr. Borkowski has no derivative right to invoke the U.S.-Armenia BIT's umbrella clause with respect to contracts to which he was never a party, and under which he has neither rights, nor obligations as a matter of Armenian law. The umbrella clause claims accordingly are dismissed.\n\n**C.

Accordingly, the Claimants allege that Armenia's allegation is not only baseless but also irrelevant.605\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 503*.*\n\n**(3) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n429.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that during the Respondent's opening argument, it appeared to resile from any contention that it had established the existence of a scheme by Mr. Borkowski, Mr. Tappendorf and Mr. Al-Qubaisi to defraud Aabar, in connection with the proposal that Aabar purchase Rasia. The highest this was put in the opening argument was that it was a \"potential\" scenario that might have existed, and that the possibility was \"not outlandish\" to postulate. Specifically, Respondent's counsel stated as follows:\n\nNow, we don't know what happened here, obviously. I have no idea what happened here. And we have suggested this potentially could have been some sort of a fraud on Aabar, but of course we don't know anything like that, but it is not outlandish, under the circumstances, given that they were actually imprisoned for this Virgin fraud and there was this 4.5 billion 1MDB fraud which got a lot of attention.606\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 2, Hanessian, 227:13-21.\n\n430.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Respondent was correct not to persist in its original assertion that the proposed acquisition of Rasia was part and parcel of a scheme to defraud Aabar. While there are any number of reasons to doubt the success of the Road Project and Railway Project, there is a qualitative difference between Claimants' advocating that Aabar undertake this risky investment and their seeking to defraud it. The Respondent has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate an intent to defraud.\n\n431.\n\nIn any event, even assuming *arguendo* that there was some misrepresentation to Aabar regarding the benefits and risks of acquiring Rasia, it is not clear how this would render illegal *the Claimants' investment in Armenia*, which they have defined as the Concession Agreements and the rights to the Road and Railway Projects granted therein. At most, the Respondent's theory of a fraud on Aabar might undermine Claimants' attempt to *quantify damages* from an alleged Respondent breach of the Concessions and the BIT, by pegging them to the value of the failed Aabar acquisition that they say otherwise would have proceeded. But even a party which propounds an untenable theory of damages may still have standing to pursue declaratory relief, such as that which, *inter alia,* Claimants have sought here. The Respondent has not demonstrated why any alleged plan to defraud Aabar should render inadmissible Claimants' underlying claims that Armenia breached its obligations to Rasia and Mr. Borkowski under the Concessions and the BIT respectively.\n\n432.\n\nThe inadmissibility defense accordingly is denied in its entirety.\n\n**D.

Accordingly, the Respondent contends, the limitations period expired on 18 March 2018.609 However, since the Claimants commenced this arbitration only on 19 July 2018, more than three years after the alleged \"repudiation\" date of 18 March 2015, any claim under the Concession Agreements is time-barred.610 In the Respondent's submission, the Tribunal must take the applicable statute of limitations under Armenian law into account.611\n\nResp.

Pursuant to Article 340(2) of Armenia's Civil Code, the \"[r]unning of the term \u2026 shall restart after the interruption. The time which has elapsed before the interruption shall not be calculated within the new term.\"633\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 602 (quoting Armenian Civil Code, Article 340).\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 605; Cl.

The Claimants submit that international law on State responsibility, which governs Armenia's wrongful acts, does not contain a statute of limitations period.639\n\nCl.

The Respondent does not assert any limitations defense with respect to Mr. Borkowski's other BIT claims (fair and equitable treatment, arbitrary treatment, and expropriation), so these claims would proceed regardless of the Tribunal's ruling on the timeliness of the contract and umbrella clause claims.\n\n***a. Rasia's breach of contract claims***\n------------------------------------------\n\n445.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with Rasia's breach of contract claims, which the Parties agree are governed by Armenian law. The Parties also agree that the applicable provisions of the Armenian Civil Code are the following:\n\n**Article 332. General terms of statute of limitations**\n\nGeneral terms statute of limitations shall be three years.\n\n**Article 337. Calculation of the terms for statute of limitations**\n\n1. The statute of limitations shall start running on the day when the person learns or should have learned of the violation of his or her right. \u2026.\n\n**Article 340. Interruption of the running of the term for the statute of limitations** 1. Running of the statute of limitations shall be interrupted by the filing of a claim in the prescribed manner, as well as by performing actions evidencing the acknowledgement of the debt by the person obliged.\n\n2. Running of the term for the statute of limitations shall restart after the interruption. The time which has elapsed before the interruption shall not be calculated within the new term.643\n\nRL-1, Armenian Civil Code (excerpts), 5 May 1998, Articles 332, 337 and 340.\n\n446.\n\nNone of the Parties has presented an expert on Armenian law to interpret these Civil Code provisions, nor has any Party presented any commentary by Armenian legal scholars to shed light on their application. Nor do the Parties rely, with one exception, on judicial practice.644 Thus, the Tribunal is left largely on its own to interpret the relevant Civil Code provisions, based on the apparent ordinary meaning of the terms used.\n\nThe exception is a single Court of Cassation case which the Respondent presents to support its interpretation of one aspect of Civil Code Article 340. *See* RL-86, The Court of Cassation of the Republic of Armenia, Case No. EAND/0052/02/11, 25 December 2012. The Claimants do not comment on the applicability of this case.\n\n***(i) Accrual of the limitations period***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nThe first question is when the three-year statute of limitations began running. Article 337(1) provides that time begins to run \"when [Rasia] learn[ed] or should have learned of the violation of [its] right.\" The Claimants accuse the Respondent of breaching the Concession Agreement by \"a series of measures that undermined the Claimants' rights and ultimately destroyed their investments.\"645 In general, the Claimants' case is that \"[f]irst in respect of the Road Project and later in respect of the Railway Project, Armenia sought to exclude Rasia and its EPC contractor and establish its own consortium using Rasia's feasibility study and work product.\"646 The Claimants allege, however, that Armenia's initial dealings with third parties were \"covert[]\" and \"unilateral,\"647 allegations which have some bearing on the question as to when Rasia learned (or should have learned) of the alleged breach. With respect to the Road Project, the Claimants say that they \"have since learned more details about the secret road project that [Armenia] was seeking to establish, in blatant breach of Rasia's exclusive concession,\" including various actions undertaken on dates ranging from November 2012 through May 2019.648 With respect to the Railway Project, the Claimants say that Armenia took steps \"to establish an entirely different consortium to continue the works,\" in violation of Rasia's exclusivity rights, beginning with project meetings with others between March and August 2015.649 The Claimants say that they \"were excluded entirely from these meetings and only learned of them after they had already occurred.\"650 The Claimants complain of subsequent dealings in September and November 2015 allegedly in violation of their exclusivity rights with respect to the Railway Project,651 but they say that Armenia withheld much of this information from them.652\n\nCl.

In these circumstances, the Claimants' pleading that Armenia took additional steps in breach of the Concessions *after* Claimants already had been \"irreversibly deprived of their investments\" in March 2015660 does not alter the accrual date for purposes of the statute of limitations analysis. The Respondent, meanwhile, has not presented arguments in support of any *earlier* accrual date than 18 March 2015. Tribunal accordingly finds that, for purposes of Article 337(1) of the Armenian Civil Code, the three-year statute of limitations on breach of contract claims began running no later than 18 March 2015, which was the day that Claimants say they learned of the most significant violation of Rasia's Concession rights, which caused \"irreversibl[e]\" loss to their investment.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 320 (emphasis added).\n\n***(ii) Interruption of the limitations period***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n450.\n\nThe next question is whether the running of the three-year period was \"interrupted\" for purposes of Article 340 of the Armenian Civil Code, with the effect that the clock thereafter \"restart[s]\" and any \"time which has elapsed before the interruption shall not be calculated within the new term.\"661 Article 340(1) sets out two different bases for interrupting the running of the statutory period. The first is by \"the filing of a claim in the prescribed manner\"; the second is when \"the person obliged\" \"perform[s] actions evidencing the acknowledgment of the debt.\" The Tribunal examines these in turn.\n\nRL-1, Armenian Civil Code (excerpts), 5 May 1998, Article 340(2).\n\n***1. Interruption by \"filing of a claim in the prescribed manner\"***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nBeginning with interruption by \"the filing of a claim in the prescribed manner,\" the question is whether Rasia's letter of 16 December 2015 qualifies under Armenian law. As a threshold point, that letter referred to the Railway Concession only, and thus could not (under any scenario) constitute an interruption of the limitations period for claims under a separate contract, the Road Concession. The Claimants have not pointed to any equivalent letter that Rasia might have sent regarding the Road Concession and which they contend satisfies the terms of Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code.\n\n452.\n\nAs for the Railway Concession, Rasia's letter of 16 December 2015, which was addressed to Mr. Beglaryan as Minister of Transport and Communication, (a) declares Armenia to have committed \"material breaches\" of the agreement, (b) \"formally declares there to be a dispute between the parties,\" and (c) \"request[s] \u2026 a response from the Government that addresses our concerns \u2026 in order that we might attempt amicably to settle our dispute, in accordance with the terms of Article XVII of the Concession Agreement.\"662 There is no question that this letter qualifies as the initiation of the dispute resolution process agreed in Article XVII of the Railway Concession, which begins (in Section 66.1) with a requirement that \"[t]he Parties shall first attempt amicably to settle all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement.\"663 Conceivably, by virtue of the letter being signed by Mr. Borkowski as CEO of Rasia, and addressed to the Minister of Transport and Communication of Armenia, it could be said also to jump to the second step in the agreed dispute resolution process, which provides (in Section 66.2) that \"[s]hould the Parties not be able to [amicably settle disputes] within 30 \u2026 days of the declaration of a dispute, then they shall refer the matter for resolution\" jointly to the Minister and to Rasia's CEO.664 The third and final step in the agreed process is that should the Minister and Rasia's CEO not be able to resolve a dispute within 30 days, both Parties \"consent to submit\" the dispute to ICSID arbitration for resolution.665\n\nC-38, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 16 December 2015.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 66.1.\n\n*Id*. Section 66.2.\n\n*Id*. Section 66.3.\n\n453.\n\nFor purposes of the statute of limitations issue, the question is whether Rasia's initiation of the agreed dispute resolution process qualifies as \"the filing of a claim in the prescribed manner,\" in keeping with Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code, or whether only the eventual submission of a claim to ICSID would satisfy that provision. The Respondent contends the latter, emphasizing the ordinary meaning of the words \"filing of a claim.\" The Claimants say the former, emphasizing the Civil Code's reference to \"the prescribed manner,\" which they argue in this instance means initiating the multi-step dispute resolution process in the Railway Concession. The Tribunal has been provided with only one Armenian legal authority in connection with that question, namely excerpts from a 2012 Court of Cassation decision that relates to the initiation of a judicial proceeding, not an arbitration.666 There is no indication in the excerpts that the case involved a contractual dispute resolution provision, much less one requiring preliminary steps before a claim could be submitted to the agreed forum. In these circumstances, the decision is not authoritative on the matter in question. Nonetheless, it does suggest that in the judicial context, what matters for purposes of interrupting a limitations period is the \"initiati[on] of a lawsuit,\" the date of which \"can be found out by examining the registration stamp on the document received in court, as well as the date of receipt.\"667\n\nRL-86, The Court of Cassation of the Republic of Armenia, Case No. EAND/0052/02/11, 25 December 2012.\n\n*Id*.\n\n454.\n\nOn balance, and absent any other guidance as to how to interpret Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code in the context of a multi-step arbitration clause, the Tribunal considers that the relevant act is the filing of a Request for Arbitration before ICSID. This is the equivalent formality to the filing of a lawsuit in Armenian court. Moreover, it is consistent with Article 340(1)'s focus on \"the filing of a claim,\" which connotes the commencement of a legal proceeding by lodging the initial paperwork before a decision-making body. The following phrase which Claimants invoke \u2013 \"in the prescribed manner\" \u2013 is a dependent phrase, which *qualifies* the primary reference to a \"filing,\" rather than *supplants* it. In other words, it conveys that a \"filing\" which does not comply with the applicable rules would *not* stop the clock for purposes of the statute of limitations. It does not convey, in the Tribunal's view, that simply following prescribed pre-requisites for a filing (such a written request for amicable dispute resolution) can somehow obviate the need for a filing itself, in order to stop the running of the clock.\n\n455.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Rasia's letter of 16 December 2015 did not interrupt the running of the three-year statute of limitations for contract breach claims, which commenced on 18 March 2015.\n\n***2. Interruption by actions \"evidencing the acknowledgment of the debt\"***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n456.\n\nThe second question posed by Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code is whether the limitations period was interrupted by Armenia's taking any actions \"evidencing the acknowledgment of the debt.\" The Parties have not submitted any authorities to assist in interpreting this Civil Code provision. In these circumstances, the Tribunal considers the likely purpose of the provision along with its literal text. Presumably, an \"acknowledgment of [a] debt\" by an obligor to an obligee may reasonably lead the obligee to consider a dispute resolved at least at the level of principle, without the need to initiate a legal proceeding. In these circumstances, the running of the limitations period is interrupted, and would begin anew only when the obligee \"learns or should have learned\" of a new violation of his or her rights, within the meaning of Article 337 of the Armenian Civil Code. The logical reason for such a provision is to prevent an obligor from encouraging the obligee's forbearance on filing a claim, in good faith reliance on the obligor's \"acknowledgment of the debt,\" and then turning around and invoking the limitations period as having been running all the time notwithstanding the acknowledgment.\n\n457.\n\nTaken in its most literal meaning, of course, this case does not involve a \"debt,\" in the sense of a financial obligation owed by one party to the other. Nonetheless, the Tribunal interprets the phrase in Article 340(1) more broadly, to include an acknowledgment of an outstanding contractual obligation to another, which is either intended to, or would have the natural effect of, encouraging a counterparty to refrain from initiating legal action.\n\n458.\n\nThe Claimants contend that this requirement was satisfied by the Respondent's statements on three occasions (15 February 2016, 18 March 2016, and 3 July 2017), each of which accordingly interrupted the statute of limitations.668 The Tribunal has examined these statements closely. Several points emerge.\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6 308.\n\n459.\n\nFirst, none of the Respondent's statements on these occasions can be said to include any acknowledgment of wrongdoing on Armenia's part; to the contrary, they consistently defend Armenia's conduct, deny any breach on its part, and contend that Rasia was the party responsible for the failure of either Project to proceed.669\n\n*See generally* C-39, Letter from Minister G. Beglaryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 15 February 2016; R-40, Transcript of the Meeting between A. Arakelyan, G. Grigoryan, H. Aharonyan, L. Voskanyan, J. Borkowski and A. Karapetyan, 18 March 2016; and C-318, Transcript of 3 July 2017 Meeting, 3 July 2017.\n\n460.\n\nSecond, and notwithstanding the Respondent's complaints about Rasia's performance, the Respondent consistently maintained on these occasions that the Concessions had not been terminated, but they remained in effect.670\n\n*See* C-39, Letter from Minister G. Beglaryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 15 February 2016, \u00b6 1 (stating that Armenia's actions \"do not release the Company from the Agreement obligations\"), \u00b6\u00b6 2-4 (calling upon Rasia to take certain next steps under the Railway Concession); R-40, Transcript of the Meeting between A. Arakelyan, G. Grigoryan, H. Aharonyan, L. Voskanyan, J. Borkowski and A. Karapetyan, 18 March 2016, p. 1 (affirming that \"certain rights within the project belong to\" Rasia), p. 8 (\"we signed an agreement with you, at the end it is in force\"); C-318, Transcript of 3 July 2017 Meeting, 3 July 2017, p. 5 (\"Yes, we have still a legally binding agreement\"), p. 7 (stating that both Concessions were still in force \"at the moment\").\n\n461.\n\nThird, if taken in isolation, several of the Respondent's statements in early 2016 could be viewed as encouraging the Claimants to engage in practical discussions to revive at least the Railway Project, rather than declaring an end to the Parties' dealings. For example, the Respondent's 15 February 2016 letter \u2013 by which it responded to Rasia's 16 December 2015 invocation of the Railway Concession's dispute resolution procedure \u2013 stated that the Government \"is willing and ready to solve the existing disagreements, while denying the existence of an actual dispute\"; reaffirmed that \"[e]ach provision of the [Railway] Agreement is important to the Government of RA, hence \u2026 it would like to clarify the process of the Company's and its own Agreement obligations\"; and invited Rasia to a meeting \"in order to restore the natural workflow as intended by the Agreement, during which [both Parties] will also deliver on the Project developments, derived from [their respective] Agreement obligations \u2026.\"671 Similarly, during the meeting in March 2016, the Respondent \"highlight[ed] that we are ready to continue the fulfillment of our obligations undertaken by our agreement concluded between us\u2026. I suggest to cooperate and revive our relationships.\"672 Shortly thereafter, on 5 April 2016, the Respondent asked Rasia to provide a \"sample time-line on the completion of the next steps and the obligations of the [Railway Concession],\"673 and pledged that after receiving appropriate Corridor coordinates from Rasia, the Government would perform its reciprocal obligations, namely approving the Corridor and exercising eminent domain over the applicable lands.674\n\n*See* C-39, Letter from Minister G. Beglaryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 15 February 2016, pp. 3-4.\n\nR-40, Transcript of the Meeting between A. Arakelyan, G. Grigoryan, H. Aharonyan, L. Voskanyan, J. Borkowski and A.

It must be recalled that Mr. Borkowski first became concerned in December 2014 that the Government was treating the Road Concession as effectively terminated,675 and Claimants now claim that by March 2015, Armenia had \"made clear its intention\" to eliminate the Road Project.676 For a substantial time after that date, there was no correspondence at all between the Parties regarding the Road Project, and thus nothing that even arguably could be invoked as an event of interruption. The Respondent's letter of 15 February 2016, which the Claimants' invoke as the first communication satisfying the interruption standard, is entirely focused on the Railway Project, and does not mention the Road Project at all.677 As for the March 2016 meeting, there is only one passage referring to roads, in which the Respondent explained that CCECC had expressed interest in investing in both railway and road projects in Armenia, to which the Government had responded that it already had an agreement in force with Rasia. The minutes indicate that the Government's representative then stated to Mr. Borkowski: \"we are very interested in cooperation with you, because without you \u2026 we cannot move forward, because you have only the rights to go and implement the project.\"678\n\nSecond Borkowski Statement \u00b6 89; *see also* C-19, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 31 December 2014.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 320.\n\nC-39, Letter from Minister G. Beglaryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 15 February 2016.\n\nR-40, Transcript of the Meeting between A. Arakelyan, G. Grigoryan, H. Aharonyan, L. Voskanyan, J. Borkowski and A. Karapetyan, 18 March 2016, pp. 7-8.\n\n463.\n\nIf the evidence had suggested that the Claimants took any of these early 2016 statements seriously and delayed moving forward with legal claims as a result, then the Tribunal might accept the situation to fall within the spirit, if not the letter, of Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code. While not an \"acknowledgment of a debt\" in the narrowest reading of Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code, statements acknowledging both Parties' ongoing contractual obligations to one another and professing a willingness to move forward could be seen as fulfilling the implicit broader purposes of the \"interruption\" provision, namely, to stop a limitations period from running while one party continues to encourage and promise mutual performance rather than a resort to litigation.\n\n464.\n\nThe insurmountable problem for the Claimants is that it is abundantly clear they did not rely on the Respondent's statements in any way. First, Claimants do not contend that they viewed the Respondent's words as providing any practical path forward to reviving the Projects. To the contrary, Mr. Borkowski testified that at the March 2016 meeting, he emphasized that the Projects had already lost the support of both of Rasia's would-be partners (Aabar and CCCC), without which Rasia practically could not proceed.679 For that reason, Mr. Borkowski claims to have told the Government during the March 2016 meeting that its request for an action plan to restart the Railway Project was \"unreasonable.\"680\n\nSecond Borkowski Statement \u00b6\u00b6 175-176; February Tr. Day 3, Borkowski, 562:15-21.\n\nC-318, Transcript of 3 July 2017 Meeting, 3 July 2017, p. 5 (claiming that he had explained this at the March 2016 meeting).\n\n465.\n\nSecond, the record is equally clear that the Claimants did not view any of the Respondent's statements in early 2016 as a basis for forbearance in pursuing legal claims. Rather, the Claimants' response was consistent with a plan to push forward with litigation. For example, on 29 April 2016, Mr. Borkowski provided no comment on the Respondent's request for a proposed timeline of next steps, but instead expressed further complaints and demanded the audio record of the March 2016 meeting.681 Less than two months later, on 25 June 2016, Mr. Borkowski sent the Government his Notice of Dispute under the US-Armenia BIT.682\n\nC-177, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 29 April 2016.\n\nC-53, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 25 June 2016.\n\n466.\n\nAs for the period following the Notice of Dispute, the only event the Claimants invoke as allegedly meeting the grounds for interruption of the limitations period is the 3 July 2017 Meeting, during which Armenia's Minister of Justice stated, in response to repeated questions by Claimants' representatives, that he considered both Concessions to still be in force \"at the moment.\"683 In the Tribunal's view, however, this statement falls far short of satisfying the requirements for interrupting the limitations period, when it was not accompanied either by any acknowledgment of the Respondent's wrongdoing or by any call for the Parties to revive the Projects. In the context of both Parties accusing the other of contract breach, and neither side proposing to resume contractual performance, a mere statement that contracts have not yet been formally terminated by either side cannot be seen as an inducement to defer filing legal claims. That is particularly the case when there were no meaningful discussions thereafter about possibly reviving either the Road Project or the Railway Project.\n\nC-318, Transcript of 3 July 2017 Meeting, 3 July 2017, p. 7; *see also Id.,* p. 5 (\"Yes, we have still a legally binding agreement\").\n\n467.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal sees no basis in the evidence for finding, pursuant to Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code, an \"interruption\" in the running of the statute of limitations for Rasia's breach of contract claims under either Concession. Those claims were not filed until 19 July 2018, far more than three years after 18 March 2015, which is the date the Claimants themselves identify as when they were \"substantially and irreversibly deprived of their investments.\"684 Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Rasia's breach of contract claims under both Concessions are time-barred.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 320 (emphasis added).\n\n***b. Mr. Borkowski's umbrella clause claims***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n468.\n\nThe Tribunal likewise finds that Mr. Borkowski's corresponding umbrella clause claims under the BIT are time-barred as well.\n\n469.\n\nAs a threshold point, neither Claimants nor Respondent have cited any prior case that determines the source of the statute of limitations applicable to umbrella clause claims. The only authority advanced in this context is *AES v. Kazakhstan*, but in that case, the specific issue was not resolved: the tribunal rejected an umbrella clause claim as unfounded, and therefore found that \"the question of limitation period under Kazakh law is irrelevant\" in the context.685 It went on to say, in the next paragraph which the Claimants cite, that \"[a]s to claims based on alleged breaches of substantial protection standards under the ECT and BIT, it is undisputed that time limitations applicable under national law do not apply to such treaty claims.\"686 Read together, the *AES v. Kazakhstan* holding is best understood as not saying anything about the law applicable to the time-bar for umbrella clause claims (because it did not have to resolve that issue), but that time-bars for \"pure\" treaty claims would be governed by international rather than domestic law.\n\nCL-108, *AES v. Kazakhstan*, \u00b6 430.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 431.\n\n470.\n\nThe Respondent does not cite any cases specifically on point either. Instead, it advances the more general notion, supported by the *Burlington* majority decision and the *CMS* Annulment Decision, that umbrella clauses do not transform the content or proper law of the underlying obligations, even if they permit claims for liability to be brought in a treaty forum.687 Neither of these cases addressed the issue of statutes of limitation.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 345 (citing RL-69, *Burlington*, \u00b6\u00b6 214-215, and RL-14, *CMS* Annulment Decision, \u00b6 95(c)).\n\n471.\n\nOn consideration, the Tribunal observes that Mr. Borkowski's claims under Article II(2)(c) of the BIT are predicated on Armenia's alleged failure to observe contractual obligations into which it entered with Rasia. Once Rasia no longer has contractual rights it could assert (because, for example, it has allowed the limitations period to lapse), it would be an oddity to allow Rasia's sole shareholder, Mr. Borkowski, in essence to revive those expired rights. Umbrella clauses may provide a path to an international dispute resolution forum, constituted under treaty, but they do not transform the nature of the underlying contractual rights and obligations; those underlying rights and obligations are still capable of extinguishment in accordance with the laws under which they initially were established. In this case, nothing in Article II(2)(c) of the BIT suggests an intention by the Contracting State Parties to allow foreign investors to assert treaty claims, derived from contract breaches, in circumstances where the right to pursue those same contract breaches has already lapsed as a matter of their own governing law. The Tribunal has already found that the claims based directly on alleged breaches of the contractual rights and obligations are time-barred under the applicable Armenian law, and accordingly the umbrella clause claims based on those same rights and obligations are also time-barred.\n\n***c. Further observations***\n-----------------------------\n\n472.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's finding that both Rasia's contract claims and Mr. Borkowski's umbrella clause claims regarding the Concessions are barred under the applicable statute of limitations, one might query why the Tribunal proceeds to discuss the underlying contractual issues in the Liability section that follows. This is not just because the Parties have devoted substantial time to briefing these issues and may wish to know whether the contract claims would have succeeded, had they not been time-barred. More fundamentally, it is because the time bar for these particular claims does not dispose of the case: Mr. Borkowski asserts a number of other treaty claims under the BIT, which are not subject to an equivalent time bar derived from Armenia's limitations period for breach of contract claims.688 Yet the Parties have presented those treaty claims as very much interwoven with the question of whether, and to what extent, Rasia and/or Armenia performed their respective contractual obligations. Given the way the treaty claims have been presented, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to provide its general views on the underlying contractual claims, as a prelude to considering the BIT claims that remain for resolution.\n\nCL-108, *AES v. Kazakhstan*, \u00b6 431.\n\n**VI. LIABILITY**\n-----------------\n\n473.\n\nThe Claimants claim that the Respondent is in material breach of its obligations to Rasia under the Railway and Road Concessions, and that these breaches trigger an entitlement to compensation of Rasia under the Concessions or alternatively under the Foreign Investment Law of Armenia. The Claimants also contend that Armenia breached its obligations to Mr. Borkowski under the BIT and international law, triggering a separate entitlement to compensation. Specifically, they contend that the Respondent expropriated Mr. Borkowski's investments and failed to accord his investments treatment that is fair and equitable, non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory. The Respondent, on the other hand, contests the Claimants' claims in their entirety, and argues that the substantive claims lack merit and should be dismissed.\n\n474.\n\nFor clarity of exposition, and because many of the treaty claims in this case are predicated on contentions about compliance or non-compliance with underlying rights and obligations arising from the Concession Agreements, the Tribunal begins below with a summary of the Parties' positions regarding alleged breach of contractual obligations, followed by the Tribunal's analysis of these issues (Section A). This is followed by a summary of the Parties' positions regarding alleged violation of obligations under the BIT and international law, followed again by the Tribunal's analysis (Section B). Issues of causation arising from any findings of breach are deferred until the following Section VII.\n\n**A. R****asia****'****s** **C****laims under the** **C****oncession** **A****greements**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n475.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent breached its obligations to Rasia under the Concession Agreements. They state that the Respondent's core obligations of the Concessions included the following:\n\na. *Exclusivity*: Armenia promised not to grant to any other person any \"concession or other right or privilege to finance, design [or] construct\" a competing roadway near its southern border (Section 15);\n\nb. *Cooperation and non-interference*: Armenia had an obligation to \"cooperate with the Concessionaire [and] its contractors [\u2026] in carrying out the Project\" (Section 38) and to \"do or cause the doing of all things reasonably required to give full effect to this Agreement\" (Section 74); it also committed to letting the Concessionaire \"carry out its activities without any interference from the Government\" (Section 39(a) of the Concessions);\n\nc. *Transparency*: Armenia committed to providing \"on a timely basis, all data (in whatever form) in the possession of the Government [\u2026] relevant to the Project (Section 38);\n\nd. *Stability of policies and legal framework*: Armenia promised to provide and maintain a \"favourable and stable legal framework\" (Section 32(j));\n\ne. *Confidentiality*: Armenia committed to not disclosing to any third party any of Rasia's \"proprietary or confidential information (including specifications, plans and drawings) provided to or arising or acquired by [Armenia]\" (Section 70); and\n\nf. *Transferability*: Rasia could sell or assign the Concessions at any time (Section 73(1)).689\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, and C-2, Road Concession; Cl. Second PHB \u00b6 40.\n\n476.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the evidence confirms multiple breaches by the Respondent beginning from the third month after the Agreements entered into force. Some of the arguments concerning a breach of contractual obligations are similar to the allegations that the Respondent acted arbitrarily in violation of the BIT, which are set forth further below.690 The Claimants also contend that Armenia's defenses are meritless and unsupported by the record or by applicable law.691\n\nCl.

The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n479.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent first breached the Road Concession by securing a loan from ADB in November 2012 and signing a variation order in a separate government contract for the procurement of a feasibility study for road works falling within the Claimants' exclusive concession territory, in violation of Rasia's exclusive right under the Road Concession to design, build and operate the Road Project within the concession area for a period of up to 50 years.692 The Claimants also argue that the Respondent's engagement directly with third parties, including CCECC with respect to both the Road and Railway Projects, breached Rasia's exclusivity rights under the Concession Agreement, which were essential to Rasia's debt financing arrangements.693\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 21\u201323, 26-27, 31, 34-37, 48-58; Claimants' Second PHB \u00b6\u00b6 46-56; Cl.

The Claimants further argue that (i) the location of the design work covered by the ADB loan was unassigned as of December 2012 and was to be determined based on results of an anticipated feasibility study, (ii) the feasibility study referred to in the ADB loan documents could only possibly refer to a section of the road project overlapping Rasia's concession territory,696 and (iii) the route was subsequently identified in the Egis Feasibility Study, commissioned in October 2013, as running from Kajaran to Agarak, which falls within the Concession territory.697\n\nCl.

First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 48, 60.\n\n482.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's argument that the ADB loan was executed only in March 2014, the Claimants argue that the evidence confirms that the Respondent issued its tender for a feasibility study on 2 October 2013, and ADB's letter to Rasia dated 25 January 2014 confirms that the loan for a road feasibility study within Rasia's Concession territory had already been obtained.698\n\nCl. Second PHB \u00b6\u00b6 52\u201354.\n\n483.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that upon securing the loan and feasibility study from third parties, the Respondent began stonewalling the Road Project by (i) rejecting the availability payments contained in the Road Concession,699 and (ii) refusing to review and provide comments on the Road Feasibility Study prepared by CCCC.700 The Claimants also argue that the Respondent set out to destroy Rasia's consortium and block Aabar's acquisition by taking steps to replace Rasia/CCCC/Aabar with a new government-to-government consortium.701\n\nCl.

Second PHB \u00b6 92.\n\n484.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent rebuffed or ignored their efforts to engage it in discussions regarding availability payments to implement the Road Project.702 The Claimants also contend that the Respondent refused to sign the MOU which would have enabled CCCC and Chinese banks to collaborate with the Respondent's Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Finance over the quantum and terms of availability payments. According to the Claimants, the Respondent's refusal to sign the MOU was due to Minister Beglaryan's decision not to make any availability payments, because the Respondent had written off the Road Project after it became clear there would be no tolling. The Respondent's refusal to make availability payments, in the Claimants' view, also constitutes a breach of Armenia's obligation to cooperate with the Claimants and to give full effect to the Concessions under Section 74 of the Road Concession.703\n\nCl.

According to the Claimants, these actions by the Respondent included its purported termination of the Road Concession on 29 December 2014 and (as discussed further below) its cooperation with CCECC on the implementation of the Railway Project with a view to replacing Rasia, in breach of Rasia's right to exclusivity under the Railway Concession.707\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 256\u201360.\n\n487.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Road Concession was never rescinded or terminated by operation of law, whether unilaterally, by agreement of the Parties or implicitly by conduct of both or either of the Parties. First, in response to the Respondent's submission that the Road Concession was terminated by oral agreement of the Parties in February 2014, prior to the Respondent's engagement with third parties, the Claimants argue that Armenian law does not provide for oral termination of a written contract.708 Further, the Respondent's Minister of Justice admitted during a settlement meeting held on 3 July 2017 that the Road Concession remained in force as of that date.709\n\nCl.

First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 111\u201314.\n\n488.\n\nSecond, the Claimants contend that the purported termination of the Road Concession on 29 December 2014 is invalid because as of that date, the Respondent was only in the process of seeking State approval for an agreement to rescind the Road Concession. Thus, the Respondent understood that any termination would require a formal State approval as well as an agreement on termination.710 According to the Claimants, the Respondent's draft proposal for State approval to terminate the Road Concession was never approved.711\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 119 (relying on R-31, Letter from Minister G. Beglaryan to D.

Consequently, availability payments were meant to meet the agreed threshold if tolling was deemed uneconomic. The Claimants further argue that tolling was not essential to the feasibility of the entire Concession, because the provision for tolling in the Road Concession was made only as a measurement for determining whether returns are \"sufficient.\"713\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 86, 105\u201308.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 107.\n\n490.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants contend that (i) the Respondent failed to provide the formal termination notice required by Armenian law, and (ii) the Respondent's letter rejecting the Road Feasibility Study made no reference to any purported agreement to terminate. Further, the concerns raised in the letter rejecting the Road Feasibility Study, namely the Respondent's preference for a toll road and issues with certain slopes and turns proposed in that Study, had never been raised with Rasia prior to June 2014.714 In sum, the Claimants argue that there is no evidence that the Road Concession was terminated in accordance with the procedures set by Armenian law.715 Therefore, the Road Concession remained in force and the Respondent was not free to engage with third parties concerning any other road project within Rasia's exclusive concession territory.\n\nCl.

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nIn connection with the Road Project, the Respondent argues that contrary to Rasia's claim to have an exclusive right to build or rehabilitate *any* road in Southern Armenia, the terms of the Road Concession are unequivocal as to their requirement of the construction of two specific roads \u2013 a $1.1 billion \"Category II\" toll road and a $80 million rehabilitation of existing roads.716 These terms, according to the Respondent, were neither waived, nor amended at any time by the Respondent.717 The Respondent therefore submits that the Claimants' proposal in CCCC's Road Feasibility Study of a single $690.5 million road, which would be neither a high speed road, nor a toll road, was contrary to the requirements of the Road Concession.718\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 25\u201326, 132\u201339, 144, 148, 150; Resp. Second PHB \u00b6 45; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 78\u201381.\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 27\u201329, 145; Resp.

Rej., \u00b6 4.\n\n492.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that while private investment and generation of revenue through tolls was a critical component of the high speed road project, the Feasibility Study made no provision for revenue generation and instead proposed that all costs would be borne by the Respondent.719 The Respondent also argues that Mr. Borkowski's testimony that the Parties agreed to proceed with a single road is not corroborated by the evidence on record.720 Moreover, the Respondent says, the Claimants themselves conceded that the two roads required in the Road Concession were not feasible.721\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 140\u201342; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 72\u201373, 75\u201380.\n\nResp.

Specifically, the Respondent argues that it did not execute any loan agreement or feasibility study for a road project which overlapped geographically with Rasia's concession until February 2014, after the Claimants had failed to perform the Road Concession.726 The Respondent contends that the loan applications it made prior to February 2014 were merely requests to be pre-qualified for future loans, and that it made no actual commitments to borrow any funds with respect to road projects overlapping with Rasia's concession until March 2014.727 Further, the Respondent argues that the Claimants knew of the NSRC project and loan agreements, but they raised no issues or objections in 2013 or 2014.728\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 226, 238; Resp.

First, the Respondent argues that having informed the Claimants of the Respondent's rejection of Rasia's single toll-free road proposal, the Road Concession could be deemed terminated under its Section 59.729 Second, the Respondent says that the Road Concession was rescinded by operation of Armenian law in consequence of Rasia's failure to perform, *i.e*., when Rasia concluded that the high speed toll road envisioned by the Concession was not feasible.730 Alternatively, the Respondent contends that Mr. Borkowski's participation in a different road project within the same geographic area for a broker fee, his letter dated 31 December 2014 seeking confirmation that the Road Concession had terminated, and his silence afterwards on the matter until 25 June 2016, can be construed as a termination of the agreement by verbal agreement of the Parties.731 Under any of these termination scenarios, the Respondent asserts, its participation in the NRSC program did not constitute a breach.732\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 236; Resp.

It argues that the alleged bribery demand, which Mr. Borkowski confirmed at the February Hearing that he had not mentioned to anyone at the time,733 is not supported by any contemporaneous evidence. The Respondent also contends that the allegation was not corroborated by the testimony of Mr. Tappendorf, and that both Mr. Grigoryan and Mr. Arakelyan denied in their witness statements that there had been any such demand for a bribe.734\n\nFebruary Tr.

The Respondent also contends that neither Mr. Borkowski's witness statements, nor the evidence on record supports his testimony that CCCC withdrew from the Project on account of the Respondent's alleged breach, its issuance of an RFP, or its subsequent MoU with CCECC.735\n\nResp.

The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n***(i) Delivery of, and comment upon, the Road Feasibility Study***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n498.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by recalling that in the sequence of events contemplated under the Road Concession, the first duty was on the part of Rasia to complete and deliver to the Government a feasibility study meeting the object and requirements set forth in the Concession. Under Section 20 of the Road Concession, the delivery of the feasibility study \"in English together with an Armenian translation\"736 triggered certain deadlines for comments and acceptance of the study. Acceptance of the study in turn triggered deadlines for various next steps, including a project financing period and a construction period.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 20.1.\n\n499.\n\nIn accordance with this defined process, the Tribunal considers that Rasia delivered the Road Feasibility Study to the Government on 24 January 2014. Although Claimants provided certain briefings on preliminary results prior to this date, including at the Dalian Meeting(s) in September 2013, it acknowledged in the course of those briefings that the final feasibility studies had not yet been translated into English or formally submitted to the Government.737 While the Railway Feasibility Study was submitted to the Government first in English on 7 October 2013, and then in Armenian translation on 31 December 2013,738 it appears that the Road Feasibility Study was finally submitted to the Government on 24 January 2014.739\n\nC-117, \"Southern Armenia Railway and High Speed Road \u2013 Summary of Key Results From Feasibility Studies\" (Rasia), slide 4.\n\nC-127, Email from Mr. J.

Beglaryan, 24 January 2014.\n\n500.\n\nUnder the contractually defined process, delivery of the final Road Feasibility Study triggered a 30-day period for Government \"comments, objections and suggestions,\" which Rasia was then obligated to consider prior to providing its own \"final acceptance\" of the Study.740 If those comments led to a conclusion that the Road Project was \"unfeasible,\" then upon Rasia's request, the Parties were to undertake negotiations about measures that \"may make the Project feasible.\"741 By contrast, if the Government submitted no comments with the 30-day period, then the Feasibility Study would be \"deemed\" to have been finally accepted by Rasia in the form originally provided.742\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 20.2.\n\n*Id*. Section 20.4.\n\n*Id*.\n\n501.\n\nClaimants contend that in accordance with the latter provision, the Road Feasibility Study should be deemed to have been accepted by Rasia by March 2014, following expiration of the Government's comment period.743 The Tribunal however disagrees with the Claimants' premise, which is predicated upon the absence of any Government reaction in the interim. In fact, the evidence suggests that the Government did provide feedback, albeit not in formal written comments. First, the Government communicated \"objections\" during meetings even prior to Rasia's delivery of the final study, based on Rasia's October 2013 reports that the study had confirmed that \"a toll road structure is not feasible for the Southern Armenia High Speed Road project,\"744 leaving only the option of a \"[f]ree [r]oad\" funded by Government availability payments.745 While recollections of the precise Government response differ, a common thread was that the Government was upset by this conclusion, to the point of questioning the continued viability of the Project.746 It appears that similar objections were voiced during meetings in February 2014, following Rasia's delivery of the final Road Feasibility Study, although again recollections differ as to the precise contours of the response.747 Whatever the wording used during the meetings, Mr. Borkowski clearly understood that the Road Feasibility Study had not been well received, as he reported to Mr. Tappendorf that he was \"in the middle of war on [the] road.\"748 Indeed, by late February and early March 2014, Mr. Borkowski appeared to shift the focus of his energies to exploring the possibility of a somewhat revised road project, which might involve some form of integration of the Rasia-CCCC project into the broader ADB-financed NSRC road program.749 In mid-March 2014, Mr. Borkowski acknowledged that this would require modifications to the existing Road Feasibility Study, including to the \"recommended alignment of the road project to the standards of the\" NSRC.750\n\nCl.

Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan).\n\n502.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, these exchanges do not point contractually to the absence of Government comment of the original Road Feasibility Study, leading to that study being \"deemed\" accepted by Rasia pursuant to Section 20.4 of the Road Concession.751 Rather, the evidence is more consistent with Rasia considering the Government's objections and undertaking negotiations about \"such reasonable measures, which may make the Project feasible,\"752 pursuant to Section 20.4 of the Road Concession. In these circumstances, the Road Concession simply imposed an obligation to negotiate in good faith,753 not an obligation to implement the Road Feasibility Study in the form proposed.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 20.4.\n\n*Id*.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 20.4.\n\n***(ii) The Road Feasibility Study differed materially from that agreed***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nThis conclusion is particularly warranted, given the content of the Road Feasibility Study, which differed materially from that agreed in the Road Concession. In several respects, Rasia failed to propose a Road Project which complied with the core object of the Road Concession. As discussed further below, that object was to develop two roads in Southern Armenia, one of which \u2013 the new \"High Speed Road\" mentioned in the title of the agreement \u2013 would be capable of revenue generation through tolls, to differentiate it from more traditional government-funded road projects. Yet the Road Feasibility Study departed significantly from this concept.\n\n504.\n\nFirst, the Road Concession clearly envisioned a two-road scheme. Section 3, entitled \"Grant of Concession,\" used two separate subparagraphs to describe these two roads. First, Section 3(b) obliged Rasia as Concessionaire to \"design\" and \"build\" (*inter alia*) the \"Southern Armenia High Speed Road,\" while Section 3(e) obliged Rasia to \"rehabilitate \u2026 the existing toll free road\" within a budget that was separately defined (USD 80 million).754 While the Road Concession contemplated that some \"infrastructure and facilities \u2026 currently or formerly used\" in existing roads might be \"incorporated in the Southern Armenia High Speed Road,\"755 nothing suggested that this provision in Section 3(b) could obviate entirely the plan to deliver to the Government of Armenia, at the end of the Project period, two separate roads. To the contrary, the Road Concession referred in several places to a map included as Schedule B, which was said to \"indicatively show[]\" the placement of the \"Corridor\" for the new \"High Speed Road,\" while it also \"reflected\" the route of the existing road.756\n\n*Id*., Sections 3(b)(i), (e).\n\n*Id*., Section 3(b)(ii).\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 135 et seq.\n\n505.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Claimants' contention that the Parties agreed to vary this central feature of the Road Concession during the CCCC site visit in November 2012.757 While CCCC's site visit report did describe its own understanding that the project was to involve the \"upgrading\" of an existing road with \"new build\" only in certain limited bypass sections,758 this report notably failed to reference the Road Terms of Reference that Rasia signed at the conclusion of the site visit, which described the Road Project as \"defined in Section 3\" of the Road Concession.759 Nothing in either document reflected an express agreement by the Government to abandon the original two-road scheme in favor of a plan that would result only in one southern road, albeit one with certain bypasses and improvements. They certainly did not reflect agreement on the significant route revision that would result from the one-road construct reflected in the Road Feasibility Study.\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6 84.\n\nC-96, CCCC, \"Site Visit Report: Southern Armenia High Speed Road Project,\" November 2012, pp. 1, 6, 7, 12.\n\nC-98, Road Terms of Reference, Section 2.\n\n506.\n\nAs shown in the Respondent's illustration reproduced at paragraph 137 above, Schedule B of the Road Concession had set forth a proposed route that (a) started out almost directly south from Sisian and Agitu, significantly to the west of the meandering existing road, and that (b) would cross the existing road (and head east of it) somewhere between Gehi and Kapan, and then (c) continue south to the southern border roughly in parallel with the existing road. This proposed route, as appended to the Road Concession, was entirely distinct from the existing road south of Sisian.760 The Tribunal accepts that the Road Concession described Schedule B as \"indicatively show[ing]\" the proposed Corridor for the Road,761 a phrase which disclaims absolute precision and naturally allows for some variation. Nonetheless, the word \"indicative\" cannot be divorced of all meaning: it naturally requires that Schedule B provide a *reasonable sign or suggestion* of what will follow.\n\nResp. Counter-Mem. p. 32, Figure 5.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 1.\n\n507.\n\nYet the evidence shows that Mr. Borkowski did not consider himself bound even indicatively by the route shown in Schedule B of the Road Concession. To the contrary, he ultimately admitted during the February Hearing that this route was \"pulled out of thin air\" for purposes of Schedule B, without his having given any prior consideration to the associated practicalities.762 That astonishing admission does not, however, change the terms of the Parties' agreement, which had never envisioned a single-road project with a route that largely tracked the existing road. Indeed, the subsequent Road Terms of Reference again referenced the Corridor for the Road Project as the one \"indicatively shown on the map\" in Schedule B of the Road Concession.763 Yet the Road Feasibility Study that Rasia ultimately delivered to the Government abandoned the two-road concept in its entirety, proposing only a rehabilitation of the existing road with bypasses in certain discrete areas.\n\nFebruary Tr.

From the outset (as reflected in the Framework Agreement), the object for Armenia was to grant a concession which would result in a \"new high speed road.\"764 The Road Concession contained the phrase \"High Speed Road\" in its title.765 While the Road Concession did not define the technical parameters to qualify as \"High Speed,\" Rasia and the Government subsequently agreed on certain principles in the Road Terms of Reference, the purpose of which was stated expressly to be to \"specify the Feasibility Study Requirements,\" including \"technical \u2026 requirements.\"766 Among the agreed parameters were that (a) the new road \"should meet the requirements: for a Class II category road as defined in Armenia's Construction Norms, and (b) was to have certain maximum gradients and minimum curve radiuses.767 Yet the Road Feasibility Study as delivered used the specifications matching a Chinese Class II road, rather than the applicable Armenian Class II specifications, and in several respects significantly departed from the maximum gradients and minimum curve radiuses on which the Parties had agreed.768 The result was a proposed design speed of 40-60 km/hour depending on terrain, rather than the 90-100 km/hour design speed that the Parties had jointly referenced in the Road Terms of Reference.769\n\nC-52, Framework Agreement, p. 1.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, p. 1.\n\nC-98, Road Terms of Reference, Section 2.\n\n*Id*.\n\nFor example, the Road Terms of Reference had referenced a maximum vertical/longitudinal gradient of 4%, but the Road Feasibility Study proposed a 6.9% gradient. Similarly, the Road Terms of Reference had indicated a minimum curve radius of 600 meters, but the Road Feasibility Study included curves with a tight 45 degree radius, resulting in what colloquially could be described as \"hairpin turns\" and \"switchbacks.\" *Cf.* C-98, Road Terms of Reference, Section 10 *with* C-122, Road Feasibility Study, p. 9; Harrison Report, 23 July 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 5.7.2, 5.7.23.\n\nC-122, Road Feasibility Study, p. 9; April Tr.

On 16 June 2014, the Government wrote directly to Mr. Borkowski, emphasizing technical concerns along the same lines as Mr. Beglaryan's 1 April 2014 letter to the ADB.772\n\nCl.

Borkowski, 16 June 2014.\n\n510.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, the project described in the Road Feasibility Study departed dramatically from the Road Concession in terms of the funding model. The Claimants suggest that the Parties had always left open the possibility that the Road Project might have to be 100% Government-funded, first by providing in the Framework Agreement that \"the terms applicable to the high speed road \u2026 *may* include (1) road availability payments from the Ministry of Transport and Communications, *and/or* (ii) tolls,\"773 and second by providing in the Road Concession that construction would commence only after Rasia and the Government reached agreement \"regarding the payment of availability payments by the Government to the Concessionaire,\" with the proviso that \"such availability payments when combined with tolls charged by the Concessionaire\" would be sufficient to cover the costs of the road, including financing costs and return on equity.774 In the Tribunal's view, this interpretation is incorrect. As a threshold point, the Framework Agreement was expressly terminated upon execution of the Concessions,775 so the \"and/or\" formulation adopted in it did not continue to be the operative contractual language. As for Section 9(b) of the Road Concession, this must be read in the context of other provisions of the Road Concession, and in the broader context of the transaction. In that context, the Section cannot reasonably be read as authorizing Rasia to propose a project to be entirely funded by Government payments.\n\nC-52, Framework Agreement, \u00b6 3(m) (emphasis added).\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 9(b).\n\nC-52, Framework Agreement, \u00b6 11.\n\n511.\n\nIt must be recalled, as a start, that before Armenia ever entered into discussions with Rasia, it had initially contemplated financing the North-South road development on the basis of loan facilities from international development banks, including the ADB. In May 2010, a consultant for the ADB (PADECO) suggested that Armenia consider a private-partnership model to finance Tranche 4, to limit Armenia's financial exposure and its need to borrow so much from development banks.776 This provides useful background to understand why Rasia's eventual proposal to Armenia must have appeared both refreshing and appealing. That proposal rested on the central plank, described in Section 3 of the Road Concession, that Rasia would \"at its *own cost* and risk \u2026 implement from *its own funds and attracted Project Financing*,\" the two-road Road Project described therein.777 The preliminary estimate of Rasia's \"budget for constructing the new high speed road\" was stated to be \"no less than USD 1.1 billion.\"778 Although Mr. Borkowski later admitted that \"this was a number pulled out of thin air,\"779 there is no evidence that he disclosed that fact to Armenia. The use of a number of that magnitude, together with language referring to Rasia's \"own cost\" and implementation from \"its own funds\" (together with project financing), clearly could be expected to connote something other than ultimate Government financing of the entire Road Project.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 102.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 3(b) (emphasis added).\n\n*Id.*, Preamble.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 2, Hanessian/Borkowski 354:1-12.\n\n512.\n\nObviously, both Rasia and whichever project financiers Rasia arranged to advance these significant funds would expect to be paid back eventually, with an appropriate return. But the Road Concession is replete with indications that at least some of this pay-back was expected to come from revenue that the new high speed road itself would generate. It makes no sense to use the term \"revenue,\" in terms of the road, unless some form of tolling was implicit in the agreement.\n\n513.\n\nThe notion of the new High Speed Road generating revenue, particularly from the use of tolling, is reflected in numerous provisions of the Road Concession. This includes Section 3(f), which anticipated that Rasia would pay concession fees to the Government, and Section 4, which described such fees as fixed for the first 10 years but thereafter variable, based on a percentage of the \"*annual gross revenue earned*\" from the Road operation.780 Obviously, if the Road was not expected to generate revenue, this provision makes no sense whatsoever; as Mr. Borkowski conceded on cross-examination, there is no reason the Parties would contract for Rasia to pay concession fees back to the Government out of funds the Government had advanced in their entirety in the first place.781\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Sections 3(f), 4 (emphasis added).\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 2, Kalicki/Borkowski, 364:2-11.\n\n514.\n\nNext, as discussed above, Section 9(b) of the Concession Agreement contemplated a later agreement on the amount of Government availability payments that would be necessary, \"*when combined with tolls* charged by the Concessionaire,\" to allow repayment of debt with interest and a sufficient return on equity.782 Nothing in this phrasing suggests that it was optional whether to use tolls at all. That would render without purpose Section 18's requirement that the Road Feasibility Study take into account the World Bank's environmental, health and safety guidelines for \"toll roads.\"783 It would also be inconsistent with Section 9(i) of the Concession Agreement, which predicated moving forward on a precondition that financing agreements would be \"sufficient\" for Rasia to operate and maintain the road \"until such time as it *generates income* sufficient to meet its obligations as they become due ('Project Financing').\"784 In other words, the notion that the road would \"generate[] income\" at least to some extent was baked into the Road Concession's definition of Project Financing.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 9(b) (emphasis added).\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 18.\n\n*Id.*, Section 9(i) (emphasis added).\n\n515.\n\nThe Tribunal also observes that Section 39(c) of the Road Concession granted Rasia the discretion to \"fix all tolls,\" provided that passenger vehicle tolls would be fixed at half of that of commercial vehicles.785 The fact that Rasia had the freedom to set the *level* of tolls underscores that the Road Project ultimately was to be at its own cost and risk; it could decide whether revenue would be best generated by higher toll levels that might result in lower traffic volume, or by lower toll levels that might encourage higher traffic volume. But entrusting Rasia with these supply-and-demand considerations with respect to toll levels does not imply that Rasia could decide unilaterally to dispense with tolls in their entirety, and thereby with the notion of revenue generation, leaving the Government to bear the full burden of road construction and maintenance.\n\n*Id.*, Section 39(c).\n\n516.\n\nClaimants note that Section 9(b), which refers to an eventual agreement between the Parties on the use of availability payments in combination with tolls, was classified in Section 11.4 as a \"[c]ondition precedent \u2026 for the benefit of the Concessionaire.\"786 From this language, the Claimants conclude that Rasia was free unilaterally to decide to waive any use of tolls.787 Of course, this argument is inconsistent with the fact that Section 9(i), which refers to the road eventually becoming income-generating, is designated in Section 11.3 as a condition precedent \"for the benefit of both Parties.\"788 More fundamentally, the Tribunal considers that the overall purpose of Section 11 is to allow a party to waive a benefit it is to receive, but not a burden or cost it is expected to bear. Claimants however seek to use the Section in the opposite way, to waive only a *selected portion* of Section 9(b) (the words \"when combined with tolls\"), while continuing to insist on the benefit conveyed by another portion of the same section that is directly linked (\"availability payments \u2026 when combined\"). Nothing in Section 11 permits a party unilaterally and selectively to edit a particular provision of the Road Concession, in order to alter the balance achieved by the agreed text in a way that is more favorable to its position.\n\n*Id.*, Section 11.4.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 1, McNeil, 29:12-18.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 11.3.\n\n517.\n\nAs for Claimants' further suggestion that the Parties subsequently agreed during the CCCC site visit to abandon any tolling element,789 this is belied by the Road Terms of Reference, which Rasia and Armenia signed after CCCC completed its site visit. That agreement provided that the forthcoming Road Feasibility Study would estimate \"investment efficiency\" for the Road Project, including, *inter alia*, calculations of \"Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Payback Period\"790 \u2013 terms which, by definition, assume some revenue generation. Mr. Borkowski conceded under cross-examination that all of these provisions dealing with a return on investment would be rendered otiose by an \"all availability payments\" scheme,791 which he also conceded was \"just another word for the government pays for the road.\"792 Yet the Road Feasibility Study did not in the end provide any estimates of \"net present value, internal rate of return [or] payback period,\" precisely because it assumed no revenue generation from the road at all, contrary to the parameters agreed in both the Road Concession and the Road Terms of Reference.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 321, 336; February Tr. Day 2, Borkowski, 339:17-23.\n\nC-98, Road Terms of Reference*.*, Section 25.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 3, Hanessian/Borkowski, 383:13-384:1.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 2, Hanessian/Borkowski, 358:10-14.\n\n518.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Parties' agreements were predicated on the use of tolls to generate revenue that would be used to defray, at least to some extent, the costs of the Road Project. This is not to say, however, that tolls were ever expected to cover the *full* costs of the Road Project. It seems clear, not least from Section 9(b) of the Road Concession, that the Government was expected to have to cover some portion of the costs as well, through availability payments that would augment the revenues generated by tolling, and which in combination would enable the payback of the financing arranged for the Project. But nothing in the Road Concession or the Road Terms of Reference contemplated that the Road Project would be financed on an \"all availability payments\" basis, which effectively would shift the full financial burden of the Project from the Concessionaire to the Government. Indeed, without at least some notable revenue generation from tolls, it is unclear what benefits a private financing model would offer Armenia, beyond the development bank financing model it was already exploring through the broader ADB-financed NSRC project.\n\n519.\n\nIn short, notwithstanding the Road Concession's reference to a two road project, involving delivery of a $1.1 billion Armenian Category II toll road and a $80 million rehabilitation of existing roads, undertaken initially at Rasia's \"own cost\" with the expectation that at least some of those costs would be reimbursed by tolls, Rasia's Road Feasibility Study proposed a much smaller ($690 million) single-road project, entailing a rehabilitation of the existing road (35% of the cost) with certain new bypasses (65% of the cost),793 to be financed in its entirety by the Armenian Government. This was a material departure from the terms of the Road Concession.\n\nApril Tr. Day 1, Harrison, 1608:4-10 (providing the 65% and 35% allocation).\n\n***(iii) Armenia had no duty to accept the Road Project as re-envisioned***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n520.\n\nGiven that the project described in the Road Feasibility Agreement differed materially from that which had been described in the Concession Agreement and Road Terms of Reference, the Respondent had no obligation to accept the Road Project as now re-envisioned.\n\n521.\n\nAs discussed above, the Road Concession provided, in Section 9(b), that construction could commence after \"the following condition[] has been satisfied or waived\": an \"Agreement between the Government and the Concessionaire\" regarding the applicable combination of availability payments and anticipated toll revenue that would cover project costs.794 Implicit in this wording is the possibility that the parties might not arrive at such an agreement. There has been no evidence adduced as to whether Armenian law recognizes the concept of an \"agreement to agree,\" but even if the clause could be read to amount to such, it cannot be read to oblige the Government to agree to a financial structure that involved *no combination at all* of the two elements, but solely of availability payments without any revenue generation from tolls. To accept such an argument would be to turn the financing structure of the Road Concession Agreement on its head, negating among other things the Agreement's provision on a \"variable concession fee\" to be based on the annual gross revenue earned by operation of the road. Other clauses of the Agreement, discussed above, would likewise have to be ignored.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 9(b).\n\n522.\n\nThe Claimants concede that the Concession Agreement would have had to be amended to reflect the significant changes in the Project that Rasia proposed.795 They also concede that the Government was not legally obliged to accept proposed amendments to the Agreement.796 In fact, Mr. Borkowski's conduct *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Government's own proposed changes to the Railway Concession Agreement (discussed further below) showed that any amendment to either agreement required the consent of both Parties.797\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6 84 (contending that the \"one-road solution,\" which Claimants say was jointly agreed during the November 2012 site visit, \"would likely have been the subject of an Amendment to the Concession Agreement \u2026\").\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 3, Hanessian/Borkowski, 405:7-13 (Mr. Borkowski agreeing that the Government was under no obligation to amend the Road Concession to provide for one free road in lieu of the two-road scheme initially described).\n\nC-19, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 31 December 2014 (criticizing the Government's proposals and stating that these \"proposed amendments cannot be accepted by Rasia FZE,\" while indicating that Rasia might propose amendments of its own in future).\n\n523.\n\nIn sum, it was *open* to the Government to agree to the major changes wrought by the Road Feasibility Study (two roads rather than one, Chinese Class II speeds rather than Armenian Class II speeds, and the abandonment of tolling). But the Government was not *obliged* to do so. The Government was thus within its rights to decline the proposal to proceed on the new basis Rasia proposed. Its decision not to accept the Road Feasibility Study on the terms proposed by the Claimants did not constitute a breach of contract.\n\n524.\n\nThe Claimants nonetheless complain that the Government refused to \"constitute an interagency working group to review the Road Feasibility Study,\" as it had done for the Railway Feasibility Study, and declined to \"provide a single technical comment\" during February 2014.798 In the Claimants' view, this constituted a breach of the Government's obligation under Sections 38 and 74 of the Road Concession to \"cooperate with the Concessionaire \u2026 in carrying out the Project,\" and to \"do or cause the doing of all things reasonably required to give full effect to this Agreement.\"799 The Tribunal disagrees.\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 24, 65, 74-76.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 66; C-2, Road Concession, Sections 38 and 74.\n\n525.\n\nFirst, as a legal matter, the Road Concession made no reference to (much less, imposed an obligation regarding) the establishment of an interagency working group. Moreover, it had always envisioned a possibility that the Government would not provide timely feedback on the Road Feasibility Study. It provided specific consequences for such a contingency, namely that absent Government comment for Rasia to address in a further iteration, the Study would be deemed accepted by Rasia in its present form.800 Nothing in the Road Concession suggests that this contractually anticipated scenario would itself constitute a breach of other provisions in the contract.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Sections 20.2 and 20.3.\n\n526.\n\nSecond, as a factual matter, the Tribunal has found that the Government did react to Rasia's abandonment of the key concept of a toll road \u2013 the most basic principle of the Road Feasibility Study \u2013 as soon as Rasia informed it of that proposal in October 2013. The Government voiced \"objections\" immediately to that revision, and indicated that it threatened the continued viability of the Project.801 The Government voiced similar objections during meetings in February 2014, following Rasia's delivery of the final Road Feasibility Study,802 and Mr. Borkowski clearly understood the critical nature of the Government's concerns, as he reported to Mr. Tappendorf that he was \"in the middle of war on [the] road.\"803 In these circumstances, with the concept central to the Road Project cast in doubt, the Government was not obligated to take further steps to evaluate the Road Feasibility Study until such time as Rasia reverted with a Study that matched the core object of the Road Concession. The Claimant's re-interpretation of the Road Project was so distant from what had been agreed in the Road Concession that the Government was entitled to say so in October 2013 and February 2014, and to decline to proceed further.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 180-181.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 204-205.\n\nCT-6, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. C. Tappendorf, 19 February 2014.\n\n***(iv) Counterproposals and disinterest in negotiations are not a breach***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n527.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the Respondent breached the Road Concession when Minister Beglaryan purportedly declared, in October 2013, that the Government was unwilling to make any availability payments at all.804 Any such declaration must be seen, however, in the context of Mr. Borkowski first having informed Minister Beglaryan that Rasia was abandoning the notion of any tolling to generate revenue, meaning it expected the Government to bear the full costs of the Road Project. It is understandable that when confronted with Rasia's starkly revised approach, the Minister reacted correspondingly, denying any interest in the Government's financing the revised Road Project. It is also understandable that when Mr. Borkowski attempted to push his re-interpreted version of the Road Project at the February 2014 meeting in Yerevan, without any element of tolling and now involving a single-road rather than a two-road project, his efforts were rebuffed.805\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 24, 65, 67.\n\nFebruary Tr., Day 6, McNeill/Arakelyan, 1031:25-1032:23.\n\n528.\n\nThe same point applies to the Claimants' complaint that the Respondent refused to sign a draft MOU by which Armenia and CCCC would seek to integrate CCCC's proposed single road into the broader NSRC initiative. As Mr. Borkowski himself described this proposal, it would require modification of the existing Road Feasibility Study and its proposed road alignment.806 This simply underscores that the project as proposed by Rasia in that Study had been materially adjusted in a manner that was inconsistent with the terms of the Concession Agreement, and that the Concession Agreement would have had to be modified further to fit into the NSRC. The Government was not in breach of the Road Concession by declining to pursue the matter further.\n\nR-19, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 20 March 2014 (attaching Letter from Mr. D. Dole to Mr. J. Borkowski, 18 March 2014, and Draft Memorandum of Understanding between Armenia and CCCC).\n\n***(v) Armenia did not effectively terminate the Road Concession***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent would have been entitled to terminate the Road Concession. The difficulty is that it did not complete the required steps to do so, leaving the Road Concession formally in place, albeit not actively pursued (after a time) by any Party.\n\n530.\n\nAs previously discussed, a draft decision authorizing contract termination was prepared within the Ministry of Transport in December 2014 and submitted to the Ministry of Justice and the Chief of the Staff of the Government for consideration.807 But for reasons that remain unexplained, the formal termination decision was never signed or sent to Rasia.808 Instead, there were certain informal communications about the matter. Mr. Borkowski says he was informed by telephone \"on or around 29 December 2014\" of the Government's decision to terminate the Road Concession,809 and on 31 December 2014, he wrote that he was \"still waiting for confirmation that the Southern Armenia High Speed Road Concession Agreement has been terminated.\"810 Although the Government apparently did not follow up with that confirmation, all participants effectively let the matter go. There were no further communications about the Road Project for 18 months, until Mr. Borkowski sent his Notice of Dispute under the BIT in June 2016.\n\nR-31, Letter from Mr. G. Beglaryan to Mr. D. Harutyunyan, 5 December 2014 (attaching Draft Decision on Making Amendments to the Decision of the Government of the Republic of Armenia No. 982-AG of 2 August 2012).\n\nFirst Arakelyan Statement \u00b6\u00b6 49-50; Resp.

Beglaryan, 31 December 2014.\n\n531.\n\nIn other words, the Government did not employ the means available to it to protect its interests under the Agreements and Armenian law. This meant that although the evidence shows that the Road Project was understood practically to be at an end, it was open *as a matter of law* for the Claimants to contend that the Road Concession was never terminated. The Claimants' contention in this respect was aided by the Minister of Justice's affirmation, during settlement meetings, that both Concessions remained in force as of July 2017.811\n\nC-318, Transcript of 3 July 2017 Meeting, 3 July 2017, pp. 5, 7.\n\n532.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent's contention that, notwithstanding the Minister of Justice's statement in July 2017, the Road Concession should be treated as having been terminated by agreement of the Parties in February 2014.812 Under Article 466 of Armenia's Civil Code, a contract may indeed be terminated \"upon the agreement of parties, unless otherwise provided for by law or the contract.\"813 The contract in this case however expressly set out the Parties' agreement regarding rights of termination. It provided that the Government could terminate the Road Concession either: (a) for Rasia's breach of the Government's rights of first refusal or other obligations related to changes in \"Control of Concessionaire\" (Section 8.3); (b) \"[u]pon occurrence of a Concessionaire Termination Event\" (Section 48), or \"based on negative result of feasibility study\" (Section 59.1).814 It is not contended that either of the \"Control of Concessionaire\" or \"Concessionaire Termination Events\" occurred.815 As for Section 59.1, this provided the Government with a right to terminate the Road Concession if Rasia \"ha[d] not accepted the Feasibility Study\" within two years after commencement of the Concession, but only upon issuance of a notice.816 The same is true of a \"Concessionaire Event of Default,\" addressed in Section 59.2; this is defined as occurring only when Rasia is in \"material breach of its obligations\" *and* such material breach continues for 30 \u2026 days after written notice thereof from the Government.\"817 In other words, the Parties agreed that the Government was required to provide notice of termination in order to activate its termination rights.\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6 236.\n\nRL-1, Armenian Civil Code (excerpts), 5 May 1998, Article 466.\n\nC-2, Road Concession, Section 47(e).\n\nThe Road Concession defined a \"Concessionaire Termination Event\" as meaning Rasia's inability to pay debts, the appointment of a receiver, its entry into bankruptcy or insolvency, or its taking of a decision to wind-up its affairs. *See id*. p. 5.\n\n*Id*. Section 59.1. The same is true of a \"Concessionaire Event of Default,\" addressed in Section 59.2.\n\n*Id*., p. 5.\n\n533.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept that the Government provided any such notice of termination in February 2014. While it certainly communicated its objections to the Road Feasibility Study, this is not the same as declaring the Road Concession itself to be at an end. Indeed, the Government appeared contemporaneously to understand as much, since in December 2014, it commenced the internal processes required to approve issuance of a formal notice of termination. That the Government did so in December 2014 (while ultimately not completing that process) is obviously inconsistent with the Respondent's contention now that the Parties had already terminated the Road Concession by agreement ten months earlier, in February 2014.\n\n534.\n\nAs for the oral discussions in December 2014, Mr. Borkowski's letter of 31 December 2014 stated that \"Rasia FZE is still waiting for confirmation that the [Road Concession] has been terminated\" (using the past tense). This certainly reflects his understanding that the Government was not supporting the revised Project, but it also constitutes a request for written affirmation by the Government of whatever message had been conveyed orally. It is possible that Mr. Borkowski was told that documentation of termination was being prepared at this time within the Government. In any event, no confirmation of the sort requested was ever provided. As noted above, the Minister of Justice later stated in settlement discussions that the Road Concession remained in force.\n\n535.\n\nIn short, there is no evidence of any effective termination of the Road Concession in 2014, or for that matter, thereafter. The most that can be said is that it is to be inferred from the Parties' conduct that they tacitly understood the Project not to be moving forward,818 without either Party taking the initiative required formally to terminate it.\n\nClearly, the Road Project did not proceed beyond the \"feasibility study period\" described in the Road Concession. Section 12(a) of the Concession states that such period would end upon the occurrence of two events: \"final acceptance of the Feasibility Study by the Concessionaire,\" and \"confirmation of the Corridor by the Government.\" *See* C-2, Road Concession, Section 12(a). It is common ground that in contrast to the Railway Feasibility Study, Rasia did not formally accept the Road Feasibility Study; Mr. Borkowski conceded this. February Tr., Day 3, Hanessian/Borkowski, 411:21-412:7. Nor, for its part, did the Government ever confirm the proposed Road Corridor.\n\n***(vi) Armenia breached the \"No Grant\" term of the Road Concession***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n536.\n\nGiven that the Road Concession was not formally terminated, the Government remained obligated to respect the exclusivity rights granted to Rasia under Section 15, entitled \"No Grant\" (and falling within Article V, entitled \"Competing Transportation Systems\"). The operative prohibition in this Section was as follows:\n\n[T]he Government shall not at any time grant to any person, including any State Authority, any concession or other right or privilege to finance, design, construct, possess, commission, rehabilitate, operate and/or maintain any road at the southern border of Armenia or connecting with Meghri or territories adjacent to the southern border of Armenia, including any road not in service on the date of signing this Agreement\u2026.\n\n537.\n\nAlthough this provision is broadly worded, it is not so broad as to proscribe exploratory discussions with third parties. The provision proscribes only an actual \"grant\" of a \"concession or other right or privilege.\" Such rights include, however, rights of finance and rights of design for a road at or adjacent to the southern border of Armenia \u2013 two rights that are directly at issue in this case.\n\n538.\n\nThe Claimants have adduced persuasive evidence that the Government did not respect the exclusivity of the territorial grant. First, on 24 October 2013 \u2013 soon after Rasia informed the Government that its re-interpretation of the Road Project was proposed to be undertaken at Armenia's own cost, and the Government voiced its objections \u2013 Armenia approved Variation Order No. 5, extending a contract with Egis to perform a feasibility study for the Kajaran to Agarak road section.819 Egis's services for this feasibility study commenced in February 2014, soon after Rasia's 24 January 2014 delivery of the Road Feasibility Study, which confirmed its no-toll road proposal.820 The Egis site visit to Armenia was from 21-23 February 2014, towards the end of the February 2014 Yerevan Meetings between Rasia, the Government and CCCC to discuss the Road Feasibility Study.821 Egis issued its feasibility study for the Kajaran to Agarak section in April 2014.822 Agarak is situated on the southern border of Armenia, meaning this study fell within the territorial scope of Section 15 of the Road Concession (\"any road at the southern border of Armenia or connecting with Meghri or territories adjacent to the southern border of Armenia\").\n\nC-298, Agreement No. 8 on Consulting Services Contract No. 02-CS-002 between Egis International and North-South Road Corridor Investment Program Implementation Organization (SNCO) \u2013 Agent of Ministry of Transport and Communication, 5 February 2014 (attaching Variation Order No. 5).\n\nR-23, Egis International, Feasibility Study for the Southern Section of NS Corridor from Qajaran to Agarak, 15 May 2014, p. 8.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 6, McNeill/Arakelyan, 1085:5-10.\n\nR-23, Egis International, Feasibility Study for the Southern Section of NS Corridor from Qajaran to Agarak, 15 May 2014, p. 2.\n\n539.\n\nIt might be debated whether contracting for a feasibility study constitutes a \"grant\" of a \"concession or other right or privilege\" within the meaning of Section 15 of the Road Concession, in circumstances in which the Government did not commit to Egis that it would actually implement any of the Egis design suggestions. Arguably, this could be seen as merely another exploratory study, without any grant of legal rights (other than the right to a fee in exchange for the study services). However, given that the Road Concession itself started with a critical feasibility study stage, the Tribunal considers that a contract for a competing feasibility study, intended to generate designs, falls within the spirit of the \"no grant\" provision.\n\n540.\n\nIn any event, even if there were some ambiguity as to this point, there is no similar ambiguity regarding Armenia's efforts to arrange funding for *construction* of this section of the NSRC road. On 23 May 2014, Armenia formalized its request for US$150 million in funding from the EDB (co-financing with the ADB) for construction of the Kajaran to Agarak section, and the EDB approved this construction loan on 2 July 2014.823 This constituted a \"grant\" of a \"right or privilege to finance\" road work within the territory defined in the Road Concession, in violation of the \"No Grant\" provision in Section 15.824\n\nC-128, Eurasian Development Bank, \"Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Development \u2013 Annual Report 2014,\" 2014, p. 16.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Claimants' contention that a breach occurred earlier, because Armenia had \"set in motion\" the potential financing of this road section in December 2012. *See* Cl. First PHB \u00b6 58. While the ADB had extended financing in January 2013 that *could* be used by Armenia to \"undertake feasibility and detailed design of Tranche 4,\" and Armenia notified the ADB in June 2013 that it \"*intend[ed]* to request the ADB to take over the construction\" of part of a southern road,\" this was not yet a grant by Armenia of any definitive rights with regard to the financing or design of the southern road. Indeed, the Claimants themselves concede that \"[t]he precise road section for which construction funding was sought had not been defined as of December 2012, but would be defined \u2026 thereafter based on the results of the feasibility study to be performed by Egis,\" and that the route was not in fact defined until October 2013. *Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.\n\n541.\n\nThe Respondent's witness, Mr. Arakelyan, contended that such acts did not contravene the intended purpose of the \"No Grant\" clause, because (in his view) that provision was intended to grant exclusivity only regarding the use of private investment for road development, not international bank loans entailing public debt.825 But the Road Concession makes no such distinction. Certainly, the definition of Concession Territory in Section 1 does not carve out any exception for NSRC development.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 6, Kalicki/Arakelyan, 1014:14-18.\n\n542.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, if the Government had formally terminated the Road Concession \u2013 as it indeed considered doing in December 2014 \u2013 then it could have returned to the international development banks and arranged for the financing and design of an NSRC road in southern Armenia, including in the area over which Rasia had previously been granted exclusive rights. But the Government did not take the formal steps necessary to protect itself against claims arising under the dormant (but not yet terminated) Road Concession. Having moved forward nonetheless with grants of rights to ADB and Egis that were inconsistent with the Road Concession's exclusivity provision, the Government was in breach of that provision.\n\n543.\n\nBy contrast, it is less clear that Armenia's subsequent January 2015 MOU with CCECC for construction of a 22-kilometer section of the road south of Kajaran,826 and its March 2015 contract with Spea Ingegneria Europea for design works of the Artashat to Kajaran road section of Tranche 4,827 violated Section 15 of the Road Concession. As noted above, the territorial reach of the exclusivity in Section 15 was for roads at or adjacent to the southern border of Armenia. The limited road works addressed in the CCECC MOU and the Spea contract did not approach the southern border.\n\nAA-5, MoU, Ministry of Transport and CCECC, 30 January 2015.\n\nC-299, Contract for Consultant's Services: Time-Based with Lump-Sum Component for North-South Road Corridor Investment Program \u2013 Tranche 3 between the Ministry of Transport and Communication of Republic of Armenia and its Agent \"Organization for Implementation of North-South Road Corridor Investment Program\" (SNCO) and Joint Venture of Spea Ingegneria Europea S.p.A. and IRD Engineering S.r.L.\n\n***(vii) Breach does not itself equate to causation of loss***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, had Rasia brought contract breach claims within three years of their accrual, pursuant to the applicable statute of limitations in Armenian law, the Tribunal would have been prepared to find the Government in breach of Section 15 of the Road Concession. In the absence of a timely claim, however, the only relevance of the Tribunal's findings regarding the Road Concession \u2013 as explained in paragraph 472 above \u2013 is the extent to which they may inform the analysis of Mr. Borkowski's BIT claims, which are not time-barred. The Tribunal turns to those BIT claims in Section VI.B, after first assessing the Parties' respective contractual performance of the Railway Concession.\n\n545.\n\nHowever, for avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal emphasizes here that a breach of contract (even if timely asserted) does not itself equate to causation of harm. For the reasons elaborated more fully in Sections VI.B.4 and VII, the Tribunal does not consider Claimants to have proven the core causative link they allege, namely that the Respondent's conduct deprived them of the value of their Concession rights by leading Aabar in March 2015 to abandon plans to acquire Rasia, and their \"consortium\" thereafter to collapse. Accordingly, even if the breach of contract claims were not time-barred, the Tribunal still would not have awarded damages on account of the particular breach (of Section 15 of the Road Concession) that the Tribunal has found.\n\n**(2) The Railway Project**\n---------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n546.\n\nWith respect to the Railway Project, the Claimants allege that the Respondent breached the Railway Concession through the following specific alleged acts:\n\na. Armenia's \"demand\" in November 2014 that the Railway Concession be amended to transfer the costs of the Railway Directorate and land acquisition to the Concessionaire;828\n\nb. A \"smear campaign\" by Government officials, through comments published in the Armenian press in February 2015, which criticized Rasia for having a \"negative posture\" towards the Government, characterized it as the \"first obstacle\" to a successful Railway Project and blamed Rasia for supposed delays in construction;829\n\nc. Minister Beglaryan's meeting with CCECC representatives in Yerevan in March 2015, and meetings in China attended by senior government officials;830 and\n\nd. Armenia's subsequent requests for proposals and MOUs regarding the Railway, from Chinese companies other than CCCC.831\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 251-253.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 253, 259.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 260, 266-268.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 265.\n\n547.\n\nThe Claimants argue that for its part, Rasia implemented the Railway Concession in accordance with its terms, by (i) constituting a consortium for the purpose of implementing the Railway Project, (ii) establishing the Railway Project's feasibility, which was approved by the Respondent, and (iii) securing a low-cost financing arrangement for the Railway Project that would have driven its implementation to a timely and final completion.832 The Claimants argue that Armenia never objected to the adequacy of its financial partners' expression of interest to finance the Project, or to Rasia's assurances to Aabar about a future contractual arrangement with Arabtec,833 which the Claimants say was not inconsistent with its commitment to CCCC that it would be the main EPC contractor. CCCC was never expected to be the sole member of the consortium, the Claimants say, and would have had to hire subcontractors, a process in which Aabar was to be involved. Therefore, the Claimants contend, Aabar proceeded on the assumption that its subsidiary, Arabtec, would be a partner alongside CCCC, sharing in the EPC arrangement.834\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 122\u201325, 129\u201330, 135, 167.\n\nCl.

Second PHB \u00b6\u00b6 124, 127.\n\n548.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's contention that they were delayed in submitting detailed coordinates for the Railway Project, arguing that such coordinates were not required as part of the Railway Feasibility Study. The Claimants argue that the routes were bound to change as the design advanced, thereby making it sensible to supply detailed coordinates during the detailed design and engineering phase.835 The Claimants argue in the alternative that if the Respondent believed Rasia had breached the Railway Concession by failing to provide detailed coordinates, the Respondent failed to exhaust the contractual processes for notification and rectification of an alleged breach, and strictly to follow the provisions relating to termination, as contained in the Railway Concession.836\n\nCl. Second PHB \u00b6 113.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 116 (relying on C-1, Railway Concession, Art.1).\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n549.\n\nWith respect to the alleged breaches of the Railway Concession, the Respondent first argues that its proposal to amend the Railway Concession to the effect that Rasia would bear the cost of land acquisition did not amount to a breach. The proposed amendment was necessitated by Rasia's delay in providing detailed coordinates for the railway corridor, which impaired the Respondent's ability to plan and secure budget approval for the land acquisition.837 According to the Respondent, the Claimants' assertion that its proposal to amend the Railway Concession caused Aabar to withdraw is not supported by any evidence on record.838\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 180\u201381.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 191\u201393; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 242\u201343.\n\n550.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that Ministry of Transport officials were justified in making statements about Rasia's responsibility for delays, given that its delay in providing detailed route coordinates in turn delayed the Respondent's performance of its land acquisition obligation. According to the Respondent, these remarks were in no way suggestive of an intention to terminate the Concessions, as shown by the Government's decision to grant Rasia an extension of time to comply with its obligations. Further, the Respondent argues that its meetings with Chinese officials and its MoU with CCECC concerned broad subjects that were distinct from Rasia's Railway Concession.839\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 205, 214; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 159\u201360, 164\u201367, 242\u201343.\n\n551.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants brought this case only having failed to secure funding for the Railway Project in the hope of extracting some money from the Respondent. According to the Respondent, the Claimants' attempts to promote the Railway Project were marred by financial difficulties, as well as by their lack of experience, lack of adequate due diligence regarding freight traffic and lack of technical assistance, all of which posed tremendous risks to investors.840\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 14\u201316, 41\u201347, 123\u201329; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8, 11, 42.\n\n552.\n\nThe Respondent submits that by October 2015, funding from Aabar seemed unlikely. Further, funding from China EximBank was conditioned on construction of the Iranian railway link, and the construction of Iran's portion of the Iranian link was, in turn, conditioned on completion of 30% of the Armenian Railroad.841 The Respondent argues that Mr. Borkowski's own letter of 14 October 2015 acknowledged that the Claimants' inability to secure funding from China EximBank was due to the unviability of the Iranian link, and not to any act of the Respondent.842\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 17, 104, 126\u201331; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6 119.\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 103, 131 (relying on C-35, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to H. Abrahamyan, p. 3).\n\n553.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Rasia breached the Railway Concession by its failure to provide, within one year of Rasia's acceptance of the Railway Feasibility Study, (i) coordinates for the railway corridor for the purpose of the Respondent's land acquisition in the corridor, as required under Sections 9(e), 21.1, 21.2 & 22.1 of the Agreement, (ii) letters of interest from financing parties, as required under Section 33 of the Agreement; and (iii) the \"design for the construction works,\" as required under Section 36.2 of the Agreement.843\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 19\u201321, 67\u201372; Resp. Second PHB \u00b6 87 (relying on C-1, Railway Concession, Art. VII, Sections 9(e), 21, 22, 33 and 36.2; C-99, Terms of Reference for Feasibility Study of the Southern Armenia Railway, November 2012, p. 6).\n\n554.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to provide any written evidence of their alleged partners' expression of interest in funding the project, as required by the terms of the Railway Concession. The Respondent argues that Aabar's purported letter of interest fell short of what was required by the Railway Concession and was bereft of details about the financing that would be provided.844 The Respondent also argues that, even if the Aabar letter were considered to have been sufficient, it ceased to be effective as of March 2015 when Aabar, according to the Claimants' own assertion, allegedly withdrew its interest in the Projects.845 Further, the Respondent argues that Rasia failed to provide a letter of interest from China EximBank.846\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 80\u201384; Resp. Second PHB \u00b6\u00b6 96\u2013107; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 130\u201335.\n\nResp.

Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 130\u201335.\n\n555.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the terms of Rasia's financing arrangement with Aabar were in apparent conflict with those of China EximBank and CCCC. According to the Respondent, Aabar was expecting all the EPC profits of the Railway Project to be retained by Arabtec, whereas 60% of the financing for the Railway Project was supposedly coming from China EximBank based on Rasia's contract with CCCC, which expressly guaranteed CCCC the exclusive rights to the same EPC contract.847 The Respondent further contends that there is no evidence on record that Arabtec's involvement was discussed with CCCC, even though Mr. Borkowski represented to Aabar that Arabtec would have a substantial interest in the EPC Contract.848\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 85\u201386; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 139\u201340.\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 88\u201392; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6 9.\n\n556.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that, by Mr. Borkowski's own admission, there is no evidence on the record to support his testimony that he proposed an MOU which was essential to the provision of letters of interest by Chinese banks, which the Respondent refused to sign.849 In the same vein, the Respondent says, the Claimants' assertion that Rasia secured further interest in financing the Railway Project from China Poly with the involvement of CCCC is unsupported by any evidence on the record from either China Poly or CCCC. In addition, the Respondent argues that all new investments from Aabar were frozen when its Chairman, Khadem Abdulahi al-Qubaisi, was removed in early 2015 when he became implicated in an alleged fraud in an unrelated transaction, effectively ending any possibility of Aabar's investment.850\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 53(vi), 105; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 155\u201357.\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 20\u201321, 93; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 149\u201351.\n\n557.\n\nWith respect to the Claimants' failure to provide Railway corridor coordinates, the Respondent argues that Mr. Borkowski's insistence that the provision of detailed coordinates could be deferred until the design and construction phase is contrary to the requirements of Section 21.1 of the Railway Concession, which required the Railway Feasibility Study to be sufficiently detailed as to enable the Respondent to fulfil its contractual obligation to acquire land for the corridor. According to the Respondent, the preliminary coordinates based on the preliminary results of the feasibility study were imprecise, and were approved by the Respondent only based on Mr. Borkowski's agreement to provide the required detailed coordinates shortly after.851 The Respondent submits that on account of the Claimants' failure to provide detailed coordinates, it could not acquire the land in the corridor within the expected timeframe, despite its good faith extension of time for relevant ministries to act.852\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 106, 111\u201313; Resp. Second PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 109\u201319; Resp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 100\u201303, 120 (relying on C-1, Railway Concession, Section 21.1).\n\nResp.

Second PHB \u00b6\u00b6 136\u201338.\n\n558.\n\nIn regard to the Claimants' failure to provide the construction designs, the Respondent submits that the feasibility study period ended on 31 December 2013 pursuant to the Concession Agreement, and that Rasia had failed to submit the required design for construction within that period.853 In the Respondent's view, Mr. Borkowski's testimony that the requisite designs were submitted along with the Railway Feasibility Study confuses \"working designs,\" which are required to be provided along with the Railway Feasibility Study under Section 9 of the Railway Concession, with \"designs for construction works,\" which were required within a year after the end of the feasibility study under Section 36.2 of the Agreement.854\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 123\u201324.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 125.\n\n***c. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nBefore turning to the four specific breaches of the Railway Concession on the part of the Respondent that the Claimants allege, it is necessary to address certain predicate disputes, beginning with the acceptance of the Railway Feasibility Study and the ensuing deadline, under the Railway Concession, for Rasia to provide (and the Government thereafter to confirm) land coordinates for the Railway Corridor. These issues are addressed in the first two sub-sections below, followed by a discussion of the specific acts that are alleged to constitute breaches of the Railway Concession.\n\n***(i) Delivery and acceptance of the Railway Feasibility Study***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nAs discussed above in connection with the Road Project, the sequence of events under both Concessions began with Rasia's delivery to the Government of a feasibility study \"in English together with an Armenian translation.\"855 Rasia delivered the English-language Railway Feasibility Study to the Government on 7 October 2013, followed by an Armenian translation on 31 December 2013.856\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 20.1.\n\nC-119, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 7 October 2013 (attaching letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan); C-127, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 31 December 2013.\n\n561.\n\nUnder the contractually defined process, delivery of the Railway Feasibility Study triggered a 30-day period for Government \"comments, objections and suggestions,\" which Rasia was then obligated to consider prior to its providing its own \"final acceptance\" of the Study.857 If the Government submitted no comments with the 30-day period, then the Feasibility Study would be \"deemed\" to have been finally accepted by Rasia in the form originally provided.858 The acceptance date was important under the Railway Concession as it triggered certain subsequent obligations regarding the provision of Corridor coordinates, financing and construction.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 20.2.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 20.4.\n\n562.\n\nWhen Mr. Borkowski first delivered the English-language version of the Railway Feasibility Study on 7 October 2013, he also showed a PowerPoint presentation (sent again by email on 25 October 2013), which described the Railway Feasibility Study as \"preliminarily acceptable\" to Rasia.859 This language reflected the terminology in Section 20.1 of the Railway Concession, which described Rasia's submission of the Study to the Government once it was \"preliminarily acceptable for the Concessionaire.\"860 As noted above, however, Rasia did not submit the Armenian translation until 31 December 2013, which the Railway Concession deems the relevant date for delivery.\n\nC-334, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 25 October 2013.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 20.1.\n\n563.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Armenian Government did not provide written comments to Rasia on the Railway Feasibility Study, so according to the strict language of Section 20.4 of the Railway Concession, Rasia could be \"deemed\" to have finally accepted that Study on 30 January 2014, thirty days from the Government's receipt of the Armenian translation. This is the position advocated by the Respondent,861 and it accords with Rasia's own contemporary understanding of how the Concession Agreements worked.862 However, Rasia contends that with respect to the Railway Feasibility Study, the deadline for its final acceptance was tacitly deferred by both Parties, based on the Government's indication that it would be forming a governmental Working Group to provide feedback to Rasia prior to a joint approval of the Railway Feasibility Study.863\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6 74.\n\nR-20, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to A. Arakelyan and G. Grigoryan, 21 April 2014 (noting that the Concession Agreements \"call for automatic adoption\" of the feasibility studies).\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 4, Borkowski, 614:6-11.\n\n564.\n\nOn this issue, Rasia's position is supported by contemporaneous evidence. It includes the minutes of a governmental Working Group meeting on 19 February 2014, which Rasia attended, which reflect a recommendation that the Government approve the Railway Feasibility Study and submit it to the Prime Minister.864 It is implicit in that recommendation that the Government did not believe its own deadline for considering the Study had yet run, much less that the Study already had been \"deemed\" finally accepted by Rasia in the absence of Government feedback. The point is even clearer from subsequent evidence. On 3 March 2014 Mr. Borkowski provided Armenia with a \"Roadmap\" document that referred to a \"Feasibility Study Deadline\" of 30 June 2014, as well as a forthcoming \"Government Decree \u2013 Feasibility Study/Alignment.\"865 Ten days later, on 13 March 2014, the Government promulgated a Decree approving an action plan which anticipated that the Railway Feasibility Study would be jointly approved by the Government and Rasia in the second quarter of 2014.866 On 21 March 2014, Mr. Borkowski wrote that Rasia was looking forward to receiving the Government decrees \"reflecting the adoption of the feasibility study.\"867 These communications suggest that neither Rasia nor the Government believed, at the time, that the Study had already been \"deemed\" accepted at the end of January 2014, as the Respondent now insists for purposes of this arbitration. To the contrary, they support Rasia's contention of a tacit agreement to extend the Government's timetable to comment, and accordingly Rasia's obligation to consider those comments prior to providing its own \"final acceptance\" of the Study, until the end of June 2014.868\n\nR-14, Minutes of the session of the inter-departmental working group established for the purpose of examining the proposed alignment of the Southern Railway of Armenia, 19 February 2014.\n\nR-16, email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G.

Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 21 March 2014 (attaching Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan).\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 20.2.\n\n565.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, the Government conveyed specific concerns to Rasia about the inadequacy of the land coordinates reflected in the Railway Feasibility Study. That feedback qualifies as Government \"comments, objections and suggestions,\" within the meaning of Section 20.2 of the Railway Concession, and therefore Rasia was obligated to consider it prior to its providing its own \"final acceptance\" of the Study.869 Rasia did take the Government's questions back to CCCC, and conveyed CCCC's responses back to the Government, as discussed in Section III.H.2 above. Nonetheless, Mr. Borkowski insisted that \"[t]he government must adopt the FS\" in its present form.870\n\n*Id*.\n\nC-340, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 5 May 2014; R-24, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 23 May 2014.\n\n566.\n\nThe Government did not issue the promised decree by the end of the second quarter of 2014. On 20 July 2014, without waiting for it further, Rasia wrote formally and \"finally [to] accept\" the Railway Feasibility Study. Rasia's letter stated that it \"look[s] forward to receiving the government decrees \u2026 that will officially adopt\" the Railway Feasibility Study.871 Again, nothing in the Government's response suggested that it believed Rasia already had been \"deemed\" to have accepted the Feasibility Study back in late January 2014 (the Respondent's position in this arbitration). To the contrary, on 7 August 2014, Armenia promulgated its Protocol 33-26, which approved the Railway Feasibility Study from its perspective.872 Minister Beglaryan formally communicated this approval to Mr. Borkowski on 19 August 2014.873\n\nC-141, Letter from Mr. J.

Beglaryan, 20 July 2014.\n\nC-288, Protocol Decree 33/-26 on Approving the Preliminary Alignment and the Feasibility Study of the Southern Armenia Railway Construction (Unofficial English Translation and Armenian Original), 7 August 2014.\n\nC-143, Letter from Minister G. Beglaryan, to Mr. J. Borkowski, 19 August 2014.\n\n567.\n\nBased on this sequence of events, the Tribunal accepts that the relevant date of Rasia's final acceptance of the Railway Feasibility Study was 20 July 2014, after a tacit agreement extended the deadline to 30 June 2014 for the Government to submit comments and Rasia to consider them. The next section examines the implications of Rasia's acceptance date for next steps under the Railway Concession, including, in particular, with respect to Corridor coordinates.874\n\nThe implications for a second set of deadlines, related to confirmation of the availability of outside finance, are discussed separately in Section VI.A.2.\n\n***(ii) Rasia's failure to provide sufficient Corridor coordinates***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n568.\n\nUnder the Railway Concession, several important deadlines run from the Concessionaire's final acceptance of the Railway Feasibility Study.\n\n569.\n\nNotably, the Railway Feasibility Study was to have \"reflect[ed] the territory\" in respect of which Rasia was to have right of use for purposes of the Railway.875 On that predicate, under Section 21 of the Railway Concession, the Government had 90 days from Rasia's final acceptance of the Railway to \"confirm the Corridor and \u2026 recognize the exclusive prevailing public interest in respect of the lands and immovables in the Corridor.\"876 This in turn triggered a duty for the Government to acquire all lands and immovables within the Corridor, \"within a reasonably short period.\" While the period for land acquisition was not specifically defined, it was described as required \"on a timely basis so as not to delay the commencement of construction.\"877 Section 9(g) in turn required Armenia to grant Rasia \"the rights to the Corridor\" as a precondition to construction, which logically meant the Government first had to be able to identify the Corridor and acquire the lands.878\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 9(e).\n\n*Id.*, Section 21.\n\n*Id*., Section 22.1.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 9(g).\n\n570.\n\nMoreover, the construction process had its own deadline, with Rasia required to supply construction designs to the Government within one year of its final acceptance of the Feasibility Study.879 Logically, the preparation of construction designs would require knowledge, in advance, of the specific route and terrain over which the Railway would be constructed. This provides further context to the Railway Concession's requirement that the Corridor would be reflected in the Railway Feasibility Study, and that the Corridor would be confirmed by the Government within 90 days of Rasia's final acceptance of that Study.\n\n*Id*., Section 22.1. Within the same one-year period, Rasia was to provide letters of interest from potential investors and finance providers, confirming that they were \"prepared to make investments in the equity or quasi-equity of the Concessionaire and provide financing in the aggregate amount \u2026 envisaged by the Feasibility Study.\" *Id.*, Section 33.1.\n\n571.\n\nThe evidence suggests that Rasia itself originally expected the Railway Feasibility Study to contain detailed Corridor coordinates. First, on 31 July 2012, three days after the Concession Agreements were signed, Rasia informed the Government that it was inviting \"world class contractors \u2026 to develop the engineering designs in parallel with the feasibility study,\" precisely because deferring engineering until \"after completing the feasibility study \u2026 could substantially alter \u2026 corridor location, and other primary project attributes.\"880\n\nC-91, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 31 July 2012.\n\n572.\n\nSecond, in September 2013, when Rasia, CCCC and Government representatives met in Dalian to discuss the preliminary results of CCCC's work, Mr. Borkowski presented a slide indicating his expectation that the Railway Feasibility Study would be submitted to the Government in the fourth quarter of 2013, and that in the next quarter (*i.e.,* the first quarter of 2014), the Government not only would \"review and confirm [the] corridor,\" but also would \"assemble and transfer land to Southern Armenia Railway for use.\"881 Obviously, land could not be acquired by the Government until the Corridor coordinates were specified in detail.\n\nC-117, \"Southern Armenia Railway and High Speed Road \u2013 Summary of Key Results From Feasibility Studies\" (Rasia), slide 4.\n\n573.\n\nThird, after Mr. Borkowski learned from CCCC in March 2014 \u2013 in response to the Government's request for more detailed coordinates \u2013 that the Feasibility Study CCCC had prepared set forth only \"relative coordinates,\" and not the \"absolute coordinates\" that ultimately would be needed for \"further design work,\"882 he did not attempt to argue that this was consistent with the letter of the Railway Concession. To the contrary, while Mr. Borkowski admitted to the Government on 21 April 2014 that the final Corridor might vary as much as \"a few hundred meters in either direction\" from that shown in the Road Feasibility Study, he defended this position on the basis that it was \"standard in railway engineering design and construction,\"883 not on any reading of the Railway Concession itself.\n\nR-94, Email from Mr. B. Weixin to Mr. J. Borkowski, 14 April 2014.\n\nR-20, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to A. Arakelyan and G. Grigoryan, 21 April 2014.\n\n574.\n\nIndeed, on two subsequent occasions Mr. Borkowski candidly admitted that the Railway Concession might have to be \"amended\" in order to reflect Rasia's new understanding that precise Corridor coordinates would be provided only at a later date. The first occasion was on 5 May 2014, after Mr. Grigoryan expressed concern that \"the coordinates already provided might not be correct as the unofficial viewing showed deviations varying from a few meters to several kilometers.\"884 Mr. Borkowski replied that \"the government should not begin allocating land\" on the basis of the \"relative coordinates\" included in the Railway Feasibility Study, and suggested that \"we should make amendments to the concession agreement based on the actual developments we experience together over time which can never match the anticipated steps in the concession agreement.\"885 Mr. Borkowski made the same point on 23 May 2014, recommending against any Government acquisition of land based on the Road Feasibility Study (\"because the route scheme and therefore the coordinates are expected to be optimized during the EPC \u2026 stage\"), and suggesting that \"various concession agreement modifications\" could be agreed later, including that the land assemblage will take place later following the start of the EPC works.\"886\n\nR-22, Email from Mr. G. Grigoryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 5 May 2014.\n\nC-340, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan providing clarification regarding Railway coordinates and requesting that the RA Government adopt the Feasibility Study and macro alignment, 5 May 2014.\n\nR-24, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. G. Grigoryan, 23 May 2014.\n\n575.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges the Claimants' argument, supported by expert testimony from both sides,887 that it is practical and customary to defer route optimization until engineering work is more developed. But that point only reinforces the Tribunal's view that neither Mr. Borkowski, nor the representatives of the Armenian Government, were experienced in major infrastructure projects of this sort. It does not change the terms of what they contractually agreed. That agreement was that the Railway Feasibility Study would \"reflect[] the territory\" over which Rasia was to have right of use for purposes of the Railway, in order that the Government within 90 days could \"confirm the Corridor and \u2026 recognize the exclusive prevailing public interest in respect of the lands and immovables in the Corridor,\" taking steps \"within a reasonably short period\" thereafter to acquire these lands and immovables and make them available for the Railway Project.888\n\nHarrison Report, \u00b6 4.4.7; First Winner Report, \u00b6 167.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Sections 9(e), 21, 22.1.\n\n576.\n\nRasia did not comply with this agreement, but rather delivered a Railway Feasibility Study in which the land coordinates were imprecise and indicative only. Given the Government's own contractual duties, which included significant land identification, acquisition and transfer obligations on tight deadlines, it is understandable that it was concerned about Rasia's approach, and that it repeatedly pressed Rasia for more precise corridors.\n\n577.\n\nRasia is, however, correct that the Government at the time did not give any formal notification of breach of contract, much less threaten contract termination absent a prompt cure.889 This left the Government's own contractual obligations still in force. Nonetheless, the Government's disappointment in Rasia's refusal to provide precise coordinates as agreed, and Rasia's candid admission that the alternate approach it intended to follow would require a contract amendment, arguably did set the stage (together with other factors) for events that followed. These issues are discussed below.\n\nCl. Second PHB \u00b6 116. The first evidence of such a legal analysis on the Armenian side was on 14 August 2015, more than a year after Rasia formally accepted the Railway Feasibility Study on 20 July 2014. In an internal Government document, Mr. Shahnazaryan of the Armenian Railway Directorate advised Mr. Arakelyan that Rasia's \"failure \u2026 to fulfill its obligations\" (including not submitting appropriate coordinates, and not submitting construction plans which were required a year after the Feasibility Study) entitled the Government to terminate the Railway Concession. R-130, Letter from Mr. A. Shahnazaryan to Mr. A. Arakelyan, 14 August 2015. There is no evidence that the Government took the steps he advised.\n\n***(iii) Armenia's November 2014 request for amendments was not a breach***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n578.\n\nClaimants contend that the Government's first breach of contract was its \"demand,\" in November 2014, that the Railway Concession be amended to transfer the cost of land acquisition and of certain Railway Directorate personnel to Rasia.890 The Tribunal does not agree.\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 251-253.\n\n579.\n\nFirst, the Government's proposal was made in the context of Rasia already having indicated its view, in several ways, that contract terms were open to adjustment. They included Rasia's major proposed revision of the Road Concession to eliminate any revenue generation requirement and therefore any concession fee payments to the Government, as discussed in Section VI.A.1 above. With respect to the Railway Concession, they also included Rasia's suggestion, discussed above, that the Railway Concession be amended to defer its obligation to supply detailed land coordinates. On 21 November 2014, Armenian officials expressly placed their proposed Concession amendment in the context of Rasia's own prior proposals for the Railway Concession, stating that \"[a]s you have mentioned you would like to make some amendments/supplements to the Concession Agreement as well.\"891 Mr. Borkowski's 10 December 2014 response rejected Armenia's proposed amendments, but promised that he would soon send Rasia's proposed amendments for the Government's consideration.892\n\nR-29, Letter from Mr. A. Shahnazaryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 21 November 2014.\n\nAA4, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. A. Shahnazaryan, 10 December 2014.\n\n580.\n\nThis context suggests jockeying for position by both sides if contract terms were to be reopened. It does not suggest the presentation of an ultimatum by the Government. There is no evidence that the Government refused to perform any contractual obligations or that it predicated its performance of any existing contract obligations on Rasia's agreement to the suggested new terms. To the contrary, the day after receiving Mr. Borkowski's rejection of the Government's proposed amendments, the Government took steps to extend the time for various bodies to take action with respect to the Railway Project.893 That is not the conduct of a party which intends to terminate a project.\n\nR-114, Excerpts from the Minutes of the Sitting of Government of Republic of Armenia, On Making Amendments to the Protocol Decision Approved by Paragraph 26 of Protocol No. 33 of the Government of the Republic of Armenia dated August 7, 2014, 17 December 2014.\n\n581.\n\nSecond, and perhaps for this reason, Rasia never contemporaneously characterized the Government's proposal as a breach. While it did contend on 31 December 2014 that the request \"cast a shadow\" over the Project, it did not allege that the Government had actually breached any obligations under the Railway Concession. Instead, it simply insisted that \"[f]or future reference, any proposed amendments \u2026 will generally be proposed by Rasia FZE.\"894\n\nC-19, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 31 December 2014.\n\n582.\n\nGiven the adoption by Rasia of the position that it was free to propose contract amendments, it cannot logically contend that it was unlawful for the Government to do so as well. Indeed, Mr. Borkowski conceded during the February Hearing that it was not a breach of contract for either side to make proposals or counterproposals regarding Concession amendments.895\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 4, Hanessian/Borkowski 688:22-689:5 (\"MR HANESSIAN: So they make a proposal, you make a counterproposal, correct? MR BORKOWSKI: Correct. MR HANESSIAN: They are not breaching the Concession Agreement by making a proposal, and you are not breaching the Concession Agreement by making a counterproposal, correct? MR BORKOWSKI: Correct. By proposal, that is correct.\").\n\n583.\n\nThird, there is no documentary evidence showing that after Rasia sent its 31 December 2014 letter, the Government made any further attempt to persuade Rasia to amend the Concession Agreement to address the cost allocation issues it had raised in November 2014. The documentary record thus supports Mr. Arakelyan's testimony that \"we prepared these amendments, we sent it to him [Mr. Borkowski], had his reaction, and closed the issue.\"896 On 26 February 2015, the Government further extended the time to organize the land corridor, given Rasia's position that it was not yet prepared to provide detailed coordinates.897\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 7, Arakelyan, 1329:4-5.\n\nR-124, Excerpt from the Minutes of the Meeting of the Government of the Republic of Armenia, On Amendments to the Protocol Decision Approved by Paragraph 26 of Protocol No. 33 of the Government of the Republic of Armenia dated August 7, 2014, 26 February 2015.\n\n***(iv) The February 2015 press articles do not show breach***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n584.\n\nThe next plank of the Claimants' alleged contract breach concerns the alleged \"smear campaign\" in February 2015, consisting of negative comment by Government officials about Rasia in the press.898 However, the comments attributed to officials in the press articles are likely explained by the disagreement between the Parties about how to proceed on the land assemblage question, for which the Tribunal has found the Respondent had the more accurate interpretation of the Railway Concession's terms. As Mr. Arakelyan explained at the Hearing, the Government was frustrated by Rasia's delay in providing final coordinates, because \"without coordinates, we cannot even plan the expenditures for land acquisition,\" a process which required formal approval of funds from the State budget.899 As noted above, the Government reacted to the delay by several times extending (through official Protocols and Decrees) the Government's time to engage in the necessary activities regarding the Corridor and to negotiate the way ahead with Rasia. The February 2015 Decree anticipated that these negotiations would be completed by 30 May 2015.900\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 11, 253, 259.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 7, Arakelyan, 1328:22-1329:3.\n\nR-124, Excerpt from the Minutes of the Meeting of the Government of the Republic of Armenia, On Amendments to the Protocol Decision Approved by Paragraph 26 of Protocol No. 33 of the Government of the Republic of Armenia dated August 7, 2014, 26 February 2015.\n\n585.\n\nThis provides context for the statements in the press articles which reported on the February 2015 Decree and quoted the Prime Minister and Minister Beglaryan as being frustrated with Rasia's delays in implementing the Project.901 As a general observation, there are few direct quotes in the articles on which the Claimants rely. The articles and the headlines are written by third parties and cannot themselves be attributed to the State, but in any event, the statements do not demonstrate a campaign to smear Rasia; rather they reflect frustration at the lack of progress being made on a project of national importance.\n\nC-150, \"The Prime Minister too has no Hope of Iran-Armenia Railway\" (Aravot), 26 February 2015; C-151, \"The First Obstacle of the Iran-Armenia Railway is the Concessionaire of the Armenian Railway\" (Aravot), 28 February 2015.\n\n586.\n\nThe first article, entitled \"*The Prime Minister too has no hope of Iran-Armenia Railway*,\" stated:\n\nThe terms of building the Southern Railway is postponed again. Today, the Minister of Transport and Communications Gagik Beglaryan said that the terms for accepting respective legal acts on making amendments in the Concession agreement and the list of actions required for building Armenia's Southern Railway (Iran-Armenia railway) is postponed for two months. The Minister talked about it with Prime Minister of Armenia Hovik Abrahamyan at the cabinet session.\n\nGagik Beglaryan connected postponement for building the railroad by having a negative attitude caused by the concessionaires. He said that their recommendations for amendments to the contract are in the final stage and will be presented additionally. Today, it was decided through negotiating with the concessionaire to submit a proposal to the Government of Armenia until May 30, 2015 regarding the principles and mechanisms of building Armenia's southern railway. In response, Hovik Abrahamyan noted, we hope. Gagik Beglaryan said that they always have hope. \"We are not going to live a hundred years on hope,\" said Hovik Abrahamyan in response.902\n\nC-150, \"The Prime Minister too has no Hope of Iran-Armenia Railway\" (Aravot), 26 February 2015.\n\n587.\n\nNothing in these statements amounts to a breach of contract. The article records the Government's frustration at delays, but it adverts to ongoing negotiations of contractual amendments with Rasia and in no way suggests an unwillingness on the Government's part to continue with the Railway Project. In fact, the February 2015 Decree specifically prescribed an extension to 30 May 2015 of the Government's previously set deadlines for meeting *its* side of the obligations to progress the project.903 That is not consistent with an intention to damage the project.\n\nMr. Borkowski testified that he did not even know of the February 2015 Decree when it was promulgated (nor did he know of the previous decrees of August and December 2014, which had extended the periods for the Government agencies to comply with Sections 22 and 23 of the Railway Concession), and only learned of these matters during the arbitration. February Tr. Day 3, Hanessian/Borkowski, 502:8-19.\n\n588.\n\nThe second article, entitled \"*The first obstacle the Iran-Armenia railway is the concessionaire of the Armenian railway*,\" was an interview with an economist, Ashot Yeghiazaryan, evidently not an official of the State, who commented on the ministerial statements about delays. It too is innocuous:\n\nToday, the Armenian railway concessionaire first of all prevents the construction of the Iran-Armenia railway\", such opinion was expressed by economist Ashot Yeghiazaryan in the conversation with Aravot.am, commenting on the Government's yesterday's decision pertaining to the Southern Railway. Minister of Transport and Communications Gagik Beglaryan reported the Prime Minister at the Government session that the terms for accepting respective legal acts on making amendments in the Concession Agreement and the list of Action Plans required for the construction of Southern Railway (Iran-Armenia) of Armenia is delayed for two months. Gagik Beglaryan had associated the delay of the railway construction by having a negative posture on some matters by the concessionaire.\n\nTo our question that some politicians are convinced that the Iran-Armenia railroad will never be built and actually, the construction of the railway is a \"myth\", Ashot Yeghiazaryan assured that it is a non-profitable project for the \"South Caucasus Railway\", which is the operator of the Armenian railway. \"It is a nonprofitable project not only financially, but also requires huge investments, which requires long years of compensation. In addition, Russia's today's concessionaire (sic) is not competitive and it is unable to provide competitive railway services.\" According to him, no new concessionaire can emerge under these conditions, as railway transport and energy are very important geo-economic infrastructures, with the help of which Russia is able to keep the post-Soviet countries to be dependent. The economist believes that the way to Iran definitely is not beneficial for Russia geoeconomically and geopolitically, because Armenia having alternative routes would mean lessening the dependence.904\n\nC-151, \"The First Obstacle of the Iran-Armenia Railway is the Concessionaire of the Armenian Railway\" (Aravot), 28 February 2015.\n\n589.\n\nIn sum, although the titles of the articles were pessimistic and Rasia was criticized for delay, the articles did not demonstrate any intention by the Government not to comply with the Railway Concession. To the contrary, the thrust of the articles was that the Concessionaire was moving too slowly in implementing the Railway Project. It is overstating the facts to contend that this amounted to a \"vicious smear campaign.\"905\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6 11.\n\n590.\n\nFinally, it warrants noting on this point that there is no contemporaneous documentary evidence of any complaint by Mr. Borkowski. Indeed, the record of this case contains no correspondence whatsoever from Mr. Borkowski to the Government between 4 January 2015 and 14 October 2015.\n\n591.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal sees no basis for finding that the comments in the press amounted to a breach of the Railway Concession. That Agreement required the Government to \"cooperate with the Concessionaire \u2026 in carrying out the Project,\" and to let the Concessionaire \"carry out its activities without any interference from the Government.\"906 It did not bar the Government from complaining, publicly or otherwise, when it believed the Concessionaire was moving too slowly in fulfilling its commitments.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Sections 38, 39(a).\n\n***(v) Armenia's March 2015 dealings with CCECC were not a breach***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n592.\n\nClaimants' third plank in alleging a breach of the Railway Concession involves the allegation that in March 2015, \"Armenia was directly engaging with CCECC to implement the Railway Project to the exclusion of Rasia and CCCC.\" Claimants say that the revelation of this alleged direct engagement in March 2015 cast \"[t]he final blow to the Projects.\"907 The Tribunal turns later to Claimants' case on causation, in the context of Mr. Borkowski's claim that Armenia's conduct expropriated the value of his rights in the Concession.908 For present purposes, it suffices to explain that the evidence does not support Claimants' case that Armenia breached the Railway Concession in March 2015, by virtue of dealings with CCECC.\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6 16.\n\n*See* Section VI.B.4 *infra.*\n\n593.\n\nFirst, as to the March 2015 meeting in Yerevan between Minister Beglaryan and representatives of CCECC, the press release issued by the Ministry of Transport stated as follows:\n\nGagik Beglaryan Receives Representatives of Chinese Company\n\nThe RA Minister of Transport and Communication Gagik Beglaryan on March 18 received the Chinese 'CCECC' company representatives headed by the Board Member and Management Director Hao Yijong.\n\nGagik Beglaryan welcomed the guests and stressed the importance of the Chinese company's visit to Armenia.\n\nAt the meeting the Chinese party expressed its interest in the Southern Railway Construction program which has a most important role for the region. Gagik Beglaryan and Hao Yijong discussed the possibility of the Chinese largest company's participation in the implementation of the mentioned program.909\n\nC-20, Ministry of Transport Website: Gagik Beglaryan Receives Representatives of Chinese Company (http://mtcit.am/pages.php?lang=3&id=5831&page\\_name=news), 18 March 2015, accessed on 11 July 2018.\n\n594.\n\nThe press statement is brief and does not lend itself to much in the way of forensic analysis. However, the word \"received\" seems to support the Respondent's claim that the meeting took place at the request of the Chinese Ambassador. The statement records that CCCC \"expressed interest\" in participating in the Southern Armenia railway, rather than suggesting that the Ministry entreated it to participate. What can be said is that the parties \"discussed the possibility\" of CCECC's participation \"in the implementation of the mentioned program.\"910\n\nC-20, Ministry of Transport Website: Gagik Beglaryan Receives Representatives of Chinese Company (http://mtcit.am/pages.php?lang=3&id=5831&page\\_name=news), 18 March 2015, accessed on 11 July 2018*.*\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal considers reasonable the Respondent's testimonial evidence that it received numerous delegations expressing interest in this sort of infrastructure project. Mr. Arakelyan and Mr. Grigoryan both testified that Chinese contractors frequently requested meetings with Ministry officials to discuss possible participation in projects, often at the Ambassador's request.911 This does not seem implausible, and the Ministry's receiving such visitors does not (on its own) indicate nefarious intent.\n\n*See* February Tr. Day 7, Arakelyan, 1295:5-16 (\"...CCECC company was one of a huge number of companies which came to Ministry and expressed interest about participation in our big infrastructure projects. So this company was most active and they were interested in participation in tenders for the North-South and another huge road project that we were trying to implement and made some announcement. And during these discussions they also told us that they are very experienced and they are very interested in participation in railway project also.\"); February Tr. Day 8. Thomas/Grigoryan, 1453:17-1454:4 (\"Now I do not recall who initiated the meeting, but usually the Chinese companies visiting Armenia would arrive with the help of the Chinese Embassy, and the Ambassador was a very active individual, and he would usually arrange such meetings. I believe that was one of those cases. That is what I believe, because I don't recall exactly.\").\n\n596.\n\nSecond, with respect to the Armenian President's March 2015 visit to China, the Claimants exhibit a speech given at Beijing University. It states at the beginning:\n\nPresident Serzh Sarkisian on Friday called for an \"active\" Chinese involvement in the realization of his government's ambitious plans to build a railway connecting Armenia with neighboring Iran.\n\nSpeaking on the third day of his state visit to Beijing, Sarkisian said the 305-kilometer railway could be part of a transnational \"Silk Road economic zone\" which China would like to set up along a vast geographic area.\n\n\"In this regard, Armenia expects an active participation of Chinese companies in the construction of the Armenia-Iran railway,\" he said in a speech at Peking University.\n\n\"That will ensure the region's even development, which is fully in tune with China's 'peace for development' motto.\" \"At the same time, that would ensure China's strong presence in the South Caucasus region and give impetus to bilateral China-Armenia relations,\" added Sarkisian.912\n\nC-155, \"Yerevan Expects Chinese Support For Iran-Armenia\" (Azatutyun), 27 March 2015.\n\n597.\n\nNothing in the President's speech can be construed as evidencing a plan to grant rights to companies in violation of Rasia's Concession. While the President did encourage an \"active participation of Chinese companies in the construction of the Armenia-Iran railway,\" there is no mention of any company by name. Moreover, the reporter covering the speech expressly mentioned both CCCC's feasibility study and Rasia's existing concession, which suggests that certain background information was made available to the press in connection with the remarks. In particular, the reporter stated as follows:\n\nA Chinese firm, China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), is already involved in the extremely ambitious project, having conducted a feasibility study and recommended a cost-effective route for the rail link. The study was commissioned in 2013 by Rasia FZE, a Dubai-based investment company. The latter had in turn a received a 30-year Armenian government concession to build and manage the 305-kilometer section of the railway that would pass through Armenia.913\n\nC-155, \"Yerevan Expects Chinese Support For Iran-Armenia\" (Azatutyun), 27 March 2015.\n\n598.\n\nThe article then continued, mentioning that Rasia itself had been in discussions with potential Chinese investors:\n\nEarlier this year, Armenia's Deputy Transport Minister Artur Arakelian said that Rasia has been holding \"very active negotiations\" with unnamed Chinese investors interested in financing work on the Armenian section, which would cost an estimated $3 billion.\n\nVisiting Yerevan in late January, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif spoke of further progress made towards the construction of the railway. \"There have been very good trilateral discussions and good decisions and we hope that [the project] will quickly move forward,\" Zarif said without elaborating.\n\nAccording to Sarkisian's press office, the railway project was on the agenda of the Armenian president's talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang held on Thursday. The office did not report any concrete agreements to that effect reached by the two men.\n\nAddressing Peking University students and professors, Sarkisian touted Armenia's \"dynamically developing friendly relations\" with China that were underlined by his joint declaration with Chinese President Xi Jinping adopted on Wednesday. Closer ties with Beijing are \"one of the priorities of Armenia's foreign policy,\" he said.914\n\n*Id.*\n\n599.\n\nThere is no evidence of Rasia's exclusion from the project (in fact it is expressly mentioned as having held \"very active negotiations\" with \"unnamed Chinese investors interested in financing work on the Armenian section\"). The focus of the article is on the Iran link and China's interest generally in the project.\n\n600.\n\nThe Claimants rely on two other documents to demonstrate Armenian dealings with CCECC in March 2015 with respect to the railway. First, as discussed in Section III.H.1, the Ministry undisputedly signed an MoU with CCECC on 31 January 2015 for construction of a 22 kilometer road section near Kajaran.915 The title of the CCECC MOU is \"Regarding the Highway Including 4.7 KM Tunnel On the Southern Section of Tranche 4 of North-South Court or of Armenia With Total Length of 22 KM,\" and the \"whereas\" clause describes the project as entirely focused on road works:\n\nMTC has plan to construct the highway including 4.7 km tunnel on the southern section of tranche 4 of Northern-southern court or of Armenia with total length of 22 km (hereafter referred to as the Project) with CCECC.916\n\nThe only reference to a \"railway\" in the CCECC MOU is in its description of CCECC as a \"Chinese international leading contractor in railway and highway engineering\u2026.\"917 This supports the Respondent's contention that the only MOU the Ministry concluded with CCECC at this time was that which related to roadworks and not to any railway work.\n\nAA-5, MoU, Ministry of Transport and CCECC, 30 January 2015.\n\n*Id*., p. 1.\n\n*Id*., p. 2.\n\n601.\n\nHowever, a PowerPoint presentation which appears to have been produced in March 2015, to provide background about Southern Armenian Railway efforts in preparation for the Armenian President's state visit to China,918 suggests that the CCECC site visit to Armenia in late January and early February 2015 was not simply to explore the road section covered by the CCECC MOU, but also \"to explore the South Railway Project.\"919 In the absence of any site visit report, it is not possible to determine the extent to which the CCECC delegation may have engaged with Armenian officials about the railway (as opposed to the road) during their visit. Nonetheless, the description of the visit in the March 2015 briefing materials supports the Claimants' contention that the visit did encompass more than just the road works,920 even though the terms of the MOU are restricted to such works.\n\nC-306, Presentation, \"Construction of the Southern Railway Passing through Armenia's Section of the Silk Road,\" 2015; Cl. First PHB n. 53.\n\nC-306, Presentation, \"Construction of the Southern Railway Passing through Armenia's Section of the Silk Road,\" 2015, p. 7 (\"Between 28 January and 8 February 2015 CCECC had sent a 13-person delegation, to explore the South Railway Project and the tunnel and bridge section of Tranche 4 of the North-South highway.\").\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 260-265.\n\n602.\n\nEven taking this as true, however, it does not demonstrate any breach by Armenia in March 2015 of the \"No Grant\" provision of the Railway Concession. As discussed in Section VI.A.1 in connection with the Road Concession, the \"No Grant\" provision in the Railway Concession did not proscribe exploratory discussions with third parties, which is the most that the evidence suggests had occurred with any Chinese company other than CCCC by March 2015. Rather, Section 15 of the Railway Concession (like the equivalent provision in the Roadway Concession) proscribes only an actual \"grant\" of a \"concession or other right or privilege,\" in this case \"to finance, design, construct, possess, commission, rehabilitate, operate and/or maintain any railway\" in southern Armenia.921 Whatever may have been discussed during the CCECC site visit to Armenia in late January or early February, there is no evidence of any such grant of a \"concession or other right or privilege\" with respect to the railway in March 2015.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 15.\n\n603.\n\nNor does the evidence demonstrate a firm intention by the Government in March 2015 to oust Rasia from the Railway Project, even if not actually implemented by a formal \"grant\" until later. As discussed above, on 26 February 2015 the Government promulgated a Decree extending the time for its agencies to organize the land corridor for Rasia's use in the Railway Project, laying out a schedule for working out a progress plan with Rasia which went to the end of May 2015.922 In addition, although Mr. Borkowski testified at the February Hearing, for the first time, that Mr. Weixin of CCCC told him, in March 2015, that the PRC Ministry of Commerce had \"ring-fenced\" the railway work for CCECC (allegedly leading CCCC to withdraw from the project that month),923 there is no contemporaneous evidence of any such events, much less of Armenian Government commitments or conduct which might have led to them.\n\nR-124, Excerpt from the Minutes of the Meeting of the Government of the Republic of Armenia, On Amendments to the Protocol Decision Approved by Paragraph 26 of Protocol No. 33 of the Government of the Republic of Armenia dated August 7, 2014, 26 February 2015.\n\nFebruary Tr., Day 2, Borkowski, 314:9-18.\n\n604.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Borkowski later told Armenian officials that \"things were going well until about August\" of 2015.924 As detailed in Section III.H.2 above, he continued throughout this time actively to work on the Iranian link problem, the resolution of which was critical to the success of the Railway Project. These actions are inconsistent with his allegedly learning in March 2015, from Mr. Weixin, that the Armenian Government had entered into some form of understanding with Chinese officials or companies that effectively ousted Rasia or CCCC from the Railway Project. The Tribunal returns to this point later in Section VI.B.4 below, when examining in more detail the Claimants' claim that Armenia's actions culminating in March 2015 were responsible for the failure of the Projects and by extension the expropriation of Rasia's property rights in the Concessions.\n\nR-40, Transcript of the Meeting between A. Arakelyan, G. Grigoryan, H. Aharonyan, L. Voskanyan, J. Borkowski and A. Karapetyan, 18 March 2016, p. 4.\n\n605.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence does not support the Claimants' contention that Armenia took steps in March 2015 that breached its contractual obligations under the Railway Concession.\n\n***(vi) Armenia's later dealings with CCECC circumvented Rasia***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n606.\n\nBy contrast with the March 2015 evidence, the record does demonstrate that Armenia began engaging with CCECC in earnest about the Railway later in 2015.\n\n607.\n\nAccording to Armenian press releases, Minister Beglaryan met with CCECC's chairman in June 2015, during which CCECC \"reaffirmed [its] interest and wish\" to participate in the Southern Armenia Railway program,\" \"submitted some possible mechanisms for the program financing,\" \"discussed [s]ome issues concerning the railway construction,\" and \"discussed the implementation specialties (*sic*)\" of the Southern Railway program.925 The coverage of these meetings primarily focuses on Armenia's \"receiving\" the delegation and noting CCECC's expressions of interest, but it does suggest that the Armenian side was beginning to take more seriously the possibility of working with CCECC. In particular, one article describes the Minister as \"express[ing] hope that the discussed issues and acquired agreements during that kind of meetings\" would contribute to Armenia's infrastructure development.926 This statement may be seen as dangling to CCECC the possibility that a contractual agreement might emerge from further exploratory discussions.\n\nC-21, Ministry of Transport Website: Gagik Beglaryan Receives \"CCECC\" Chinese Company Representatives (http://mtcit.am/pages.php?lang=3&page\\_id=1&id=5935&page\\_n ame=news), 23 June 2015, accessed on 11 July 2018; *see also* C-161, \"CCECC's Wish to Participate in the Construction Project of Armenia's Southern Railway\" (Aysor), 23 June 2015; C-162, \"Armenia's Minister of Transport Receives CCECC Delegation\" (Tert.am), 23 June 2015; C-302, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia, Annual Report Summary of the Asia, Oceania, and Africa Committee, Year 2015, p. 3 (summarizing CCECC visit to Yerevan on 22 June 2015).\n\nC-21, Ministry of Transport Website: Gagik Beglaryan Receives \"CCECC\" Chinese Company Representatives (http://mtcit.am/pages.php?lang=3&page\\_id=1&id=5935&page\\_n ame=news), 23 June 2015, accessed on 11 July 2018.\n\n608.\n\nBy mid-August 2015, the Ministry of Transport had decided to organize a delegation to visit China in order to discuss railway issues in more detail. It appears that at this time the Ministry remained mindful of its existing Railway Concession with Rasia. But while it knew CCCC had prepared the existing Railway Feasibility Study, it considered itself free to explore proposals for other Chinese companies to become involved, possibly within the rubric of a continuing Rasia concession. Thus, an article dated 13 August 2015, quoting Minister Beglaryan, described the situation as follows, referring both to the Rasia concession, to CCCC's past work on the project, and to upcoming Government discussions directly with Chinese companies:\n\nChinese companies have shown interest in a project calling for the construction of a railway link between Armenia and Iran, Minister of Transport and Communications Gagik Beglaryan told a Cabinet session today. According to him, an Armenian delegation that will visit China soon will discuss this issue in detail with Chinese peers.\n\n\"This issue is in our spotlight as it is very important for our country. In September, an Armenian delegation will fly to China, where we will discuss this issue. We have received offers from many Chinese companies, but we have chosen two companies with good reputation,\" said Beglaryan.\n\n\"We have received very good proposals from our Chinese partners and we will consider them,\" said Beglaryan.\n\nThe agreement on the construction of the rail link was approved by Armenian and Iranian governments in 2009. In 2012, the Dubai-based Rasia FZE Investment Company was granted a 50-year concession by the Armenian government to build and manage the 305-kilometer railway from Armenia to Iran, to be named the Southern Armenian Railway (SAR).\n\nBy late 2013 Rasia FZE contracted the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) to develop a feasibility study for the project, estimated to cost $3.5 billion. The high cost is explained by mountainous terrain through which itis supposed to pass. Specifically, the 305 km-long railway will have 19.6 km-long 64 bridges and 60 tunnels of 102.3 kilometers.\n\nThe railway is to run from Gagarin station in Armenia's Gegharkunik province to Agarak in southern Syunik and may transport up to 25 million cargos a year.\n\nAccording to an Armenian government statement, the Southern Armenia Railway will create the shortest transportation route from the ports of the Black Sea to the ports of the Persian Gulf and establish a major commodities transit corridor between Europe and the Persian Gulf region.\" There were media reports saying Chinese companies were ready to finance 60% of the project.927\n\nC-163, \"Chinese companies show interest in Armenia - Iran railway link-minister,\" 13 August 2015.\n\n609.\n\nOn 24 August 2015, the Minister of Transport wrote specifically to the President of CCECC, inviting him to meetings to discuss CCECC's \"potential participation in implementation\" of the Railway Project. The letter stated as follows:\n\nWe have been contemplating the possibility of our cooperation for the realization of priority projects in the transport infrastructure for a while now. More specifically this concerns the North-Highway and the Southern Railway projects as part of the Silk Road. In order to discuss these projects in more details and to speed up the process of clarifications on your potential participation in their implementation, herewith I would like to invite you to Yerevan some time at your own convenience within the upcoming month, prior to the Armenian Delegation visit to Beijing in September.928\n\nC-307, Letter from Minister G. Beglaryan to Yan Li, President of CCECC, 24 August 2015).\n\n610.\n\nBy 22 September 2015, a press article suggested that senior Armenian officials would soon have detailed discussions in Beijing specifically with CCECC:\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang and his visiting Armenian counterpart Hovik Abrahamian reportedly discussed China's possible involvement in an ambitious project to build a railway connecting Armenia with Iran when they met in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Chinese premier reaffirmed the Chinese side's interest in the issue,\" the Armenian Government said in a statement. It said the two men discussed the matter \"in detail\" but did not elaborate.\n\nThe official Chinese Xinhua news agency made no specific mention of the Armenian-Iranian project in its report on the talks. \"The Chinese government supports Chinese companies to participate in major infrastructure projects in Armenia, such as highways and nuclear power plants,\" it quoted Li as telling Abrahamian.\n\nTransport and Communications Minister Gagik Beglarian (sic) said last month that a Chinese company has presented Yerevan with \"very good proposals\" regarding the railway's construction, which would cost an estimated $3 billion. Beglarian refused to disclose those proposals, saying only that Armenian and Chinese officials will hold substantive talks on them in September.\n\nAbrahamian's press office said over the weekend that while in Beijing the Armenian premier will meet not only with top Chinese government officials but also senior executives from the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC). The state-run Corporation is engaged in railway construction in and outside China.\n\nAnother firm, China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), has already conducted a feasibility study on the railway project. The study was commissioned in 2013 by a Dubai-based investment company that had received a 30-year Armenian government concession to build and manage the 305-kilometer-long Armenian section of the railway.\n\nPresident Serzh Sarkisian called for \"active\" Chinese involvement in the projects implementation when he made a state visit to China in March. The issue is on the agenda of Sarkisian's talks with Li.\u2026929\n\nC-166, \"China/Armenia in 'Detailed\"' Talks on Iran Railway,\" 22 September 2015.\n\n611.\n\nIn other words, in the second half of 2015, and certainly by the third quarter of that year, Armenian officials were seeking active engagement directly with CCECC, without involving Rasia in these discussions or apparently giving consideration to whether this might undermine any commitments Rasia had given to CCCC.\n\n***(vii) By that time, Rasia itself had failed to perform***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n612.\n\nThis conduct however must be seen in the relevant context, which included the following:\n\na. No progress had been made on the Corridor lands coordinates issue since February 2014.\n\nb. Mr. Borkowski had not been in written communication with Armenia since December 2014.\n\nc. There had been no further negotiations on amending the Railway Concession, as contemplated by Mr. Borkowski in his letter of 31 December 2014 and by the Ministry in its Decree of 26 February 2015.930\n\nC-19, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan, 31 December 2014; R-124, Excerpt from the Minutes of the Meeting of the Government of the Republic of Armenia, On Amendments to the Protocol Decision Approved by Paragraph 26 of Protocol No. 33 of the Government of the Republic of Armenia dated August 7, 2014, 26 February 2015.\n\n613.\n\nIn addition, by this time, the Railway Concession's deadlines for Rasia to demonstrate sufficient outside financing had expired. Section 31.1 of the Railway Concession provided that the \"Project Financing Period\" would be one year from Rasia's acceptance of the Railway Feasibility Study, and Section 33.1 imposed the same deadline for submission of letters of interest from investors, demonstrating that they were \"prepared to make investments in the equity or quasi-equity of the Concessionaire and provide debt financing in the aggregate amount not less than the total financing envisaged by the Feasibility Study.\"931 Even accepting the Claimants' contention that the Railway Feasibility Study was not deemed accepted by Rasia until it did so formally on 20 July 2014, because of a tacit agreement to extend the Government's timetable to comment and the Parties' joint deadline to provide acceptances, the \"Project Financing Period\" had expired no later than 20 July 2015.932 Yet by then, Rasia had not provided Armenia with any documentation by which investors stated that they were actually \"prepared to\" provide equity or debt financing in the aggregate amounts required by the Railway Feasibility Study ($3.2 billion).\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Sections 31.1, 33.1.\n\nThe Respondent seems to accept this as the relevant time period, contending that \"the one-year period to provide evidence of financing had ended in 2015.\" Resp. Rej. \u00b6 364.\n\n614.\n\nThe Claimants contend that this obligation was satisfied, first, in the form of the Railway Feasibility Study itself (referring to Chinese debt financing),933 and, second, in Aabar's letter to Rasia of 21 September 2014, of which Mr. Borkowski says he made Armenia aware on 10 November 2014.934 The Tribunal disagrees that either of these documents meets the contractual requirement. First, with respect to the Railway Feasibility Study, all it stated was that the Project as described therein \"allows for loans\" from China EximBank, and that it was \"currently anticipated\" that loans would be secured from that source.935 This statement of CCCC's expectations, unaccompanied by any explanation of the basis for that optimism, did not constitute a contractually adequate \"letter of interest\" from an outside investor confirming that it was \"prepared to make investments\" in the Railway Project.936 Moreover, Mr. Borkowski's slide presentation during the February 2014 Yerevan Meetings held to discuss the Feasibility Studies stated that the Railway Project would be \"highly dependent on China bank negotiations,\" following certain \"preliminary discussions with China banks\" which \"assumed\" they would finance 60% of the estimated $3.2 billion Project cost.937 That contemporaneous document seems to confirm that no funding commitments had yet been secured from China Eximbank or any other Chinese bank. The record does not contain or reference any documents ever issued by any Chinese bank.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 2, Hanessian/Borkowski, 321:2-13, and Day 3, Hanessian/Borkowski, 510:6-20.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 128-130.\n\nC-116, Railway Feasibility Study, pp. 12, 15, 168. The statements in the Road Feasibility Study were even more attenuated: \"[i]t is currently anticipated that the Project costs \u2026 will be borne by the government of the Republic of Armenia through the provision of availability payments,\" and \"[b]ased on the availability payments*, it is anticipated* that the Project *should be able* to secure loans from the Export-Import Bank of China or China Development Bank \u2026.\" C-122, Road Feasibility Study, p. 125 (emphasis added).\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Sections 31.1, 33.1.\n\nC-131, \"Southern Armenia Railway Project and Southern Armenia High Speed Road Project\" (Razia FZE), February 2014, p. 15.\n\n615.\n\nSecond, while Aabar's September 2014 letter to Rasia (shared with Armenia in November 2014) stated that it could arrange financing for the remaining 40% of the Railway Project, that proposal was on the understanding not only that China EximBank would be covering 60% of the costs, but also that Aabar's affiliate, Arabtec, would \"play[] the management role\" in the EPC contract and that \"all of the EPC profits [would] benefit[] Arabtec Construction.\"938 Aabar seemed unaware that Rasia had already committed contractually to giving CCCC the \"exclusive\" EPC role,939 or that Rasia had told Armenia that \"working with a China contractor, such as CCCC, is a mandatory prerequisite for seeking the required China government financing.\"940 Indeed, it is notable that as of three months later, when Aabar prepared a list of the documentation supposedly reviewed in its due diligence investigation of the Projects, there is no reference to the Rasia-CCCC Framework Agreement at all.941 In this context, the Tribunal cannot accept the explanation, which the Claimants' witnesses appeared to have coordinated for the hearing, that Aabar's reference in the September 2014 letter to its interest being predicated on Arabtec's playing the central EPC role was simply a \"drafting error.\"942\n\nC-13, Letter from Mr. C. Tappendorf to Mr. J. Borkowski, 21 September 2014.\n\nR-8, Rasia-CCCC Framework Agreement, p. 2 (stating that Rasia \"desires to appoint CCCC as the lead member of its Consortium and exclusive EPC for developing\" both the Road and Railway Projects).\n\nC-101, Letter from Mr. J. Borkowski to Minister G. Beglaryan (Unofficial Translation and Armenian Original), 21 December 2012, pp. 1-2.\n\nC-145, Aabar, Term Sheet, 18 December 2014.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 3, Hanessian/Borkowski, 549:14-50:5 (offering this explanation during cross-examination, without explaining how he could speak for Aabar's intentions on this point); Feb. Tr. Day 5, Hanessian/Tappendorf, 867:19-869:18 (subsequently volunteering without prompting that this passage of his letter was \"poorly written\" on this point of exclusivity).\n\n616.\n\nIn other words, standing alone, the Aabar letter might qualify as an expression of interest within the meaning of the Railway Concession. But its terms conflicted directly with the putative terms on which CCCC had agreed to work with Rasia, including assisting with obtaining Chinese bank financing. The Railway Concession had required Rasia to present letters of interest demonstrating a collection of investors who together were \"prepared to make investments\" in an \"*aggregate amount* not less than the *total financing* envisaged by the Feasibility Study.\"943 This obligation could not be satisfied by promising the same consideration (a lead EPC role and control of EPC profits) to multiple recipients, in circumstances in which moving forward with one putative consortium partner would almost certainly prompt another to reconsider its participation.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Sections 31.1, 33.1 (emphasis added).\n\n617.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Claimants' suggestion that the fundamental inconsistency between Rasia's promises to CCCC and Aabar could be resolved simply by designating Arabtec as a subcontractor to CCCC. CCCC had been promised the \"exclusive\" EPC role, which carried with it the right to select its own subcontractors. There is no reason to imagine that CCCC would have been willing to forgo working with Chinese subcontractors, and accept instead that a major \"management role\" and \"EPC profits\" opportunity be hived off to a U.A.E. company. Nor is there any reason to believe that Aabar would have been willing to provide financing on the basis that Arabtec became a mere subcontractor to a Chinese lead EPC contractor. Most importantly, there is no evidence that Rasia even brought this conflict to the attention of Aabar and CCCC, let alone tried to mediate it, much less that it had arrived at some consistent understanding with CCCC and Aabar on the basis of which both China EximBank (with which Rasia was not even in direct contact) and Aabar would be prepared to finance the Railway Project. Certainly, Rasia did not present Armenia with any other \"letters of interest\" before the expiration of the Project Financing Period in July 2015, which might have demonstrated that it had actually lined up a consortium of investors prepared to move forward with funding on terms that, realistically, Rasia could promise, and upon which it could deliver, to both. The Claimants' repeated reference to having such a \"consortium\" appears more like wishful thinking, on the basis of a series of negotiations which had shown some promise but were far from crystallizing into a realistic package of commitments on which the Railway Project could move forward.\n\n618.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses separately, in Section VI.B.4 below, the Claimants' contention that Aabar nonetheless would have proceeded to acquire Rasia in April 2015, but for the conduct of Armenia culminating in March 2015. For the reasons there set forth, the Tribunal does not accept this contention. And certainly, after March 2015, the Claimants themselves concede they no longer had a workable \"consortium\" to move the Railway Project forward either technically (through CCCC) or financially (through a combination of Aabar and Chinese bank financing allegedly arranged by CCCC).\n\n619.\n\nIn other words, the factual reality is that by the second half of 2015, when Armenia began actively to solicit interest from CCECC in the Southern Armenia Railway, Rasia had already missed several important deadlines under the Railway Concession, and the Railway Project was already in serious straits. Armenia's actions must be seen in that context. At the same time, neither the Government, nor Rasia had taken any steps affirmatively to terminate the Railway Concession. In consequence, the Concession remained legally in force, as Armenia's Minister of Justice conceded in July 2017.944\n\nC-318, Transcript of 3 July 2017 Meeting, 3 July 2017, pp. 5, 7. The Minister's 2017 acknowledgment that the Railway Concession remained a legally binding document, together with the fact that the Concession provided a specific mechanism for termination based on breach, lays to rest the Respondent's argument, in this arbitration, that the Concession should be treated as having been rescinded either by party agreement or as a matter of law, under Article 466 of the Armenian Civil Code. *See* Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 608-612; Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 349-351.\n\n***(viii) Armenia's approach to CCECC breached its duty of cooperation***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n620.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it appears that Armenia started to explore in earnest the possibility that CCECC might construct the Southern Armenia Railway, without coordinating this approach through Rasia. This conduct may be seen as akin to the Government's actions with respect to the Road Concession (discussed in Section VI.A.1 above), where it eventually began seeking other avenues for progress on the Southern Armenia road, after becoming disillusioned with Rasia, but without formally terminating the Concession still in force between them.\n\n621.\n\nAs previously discussed, the Government's mere holding of exploratory discussions was not a breach of the \"No Grant\" provision (Section 15) of the Railway Concession, in the absence of any evidence that Armenia actually granted \"any concession or other right or privilege\" to CCECC or any other entity. It is undisputed, as the Respondent notes, that \"Armenia never established a parallel consortium or otherwise entered into any agreements with anyone other than Rasia\" for the Railway Concession.945 On the other hand, the Claimants contend that the Government's conduct still breached its separate contractual duties under the Railway Concession to act in good faith towards Rasia and to give \"full effect\" to the Railway Concession.946 Armenia also had a general obligation under the Railway Concession to \"cooperate with the Concessionaire, its contractors and sub-contractors \u2026 in carrying out the Project.\"947\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 432.\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6 274.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 38.\n\n622.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts, at the level of principle, that a contract party may breach such \"soft\" contractual obligations by holding public negotiations with potential competitors, even if such efforts do not immediately (or ever) bear fruit in the form of a grant of competing legal rights. In this case, given that neither Armenia, nor Rasia had ever taken steps to terminate the Railway Concession, Armenia's conduct in the third quarter of 2015 \u2013 seeking new Chinese construction partners without coordinating these efforts with Rasia or its contractor CCCC \u2013 can be seen as breaching its subsisting general duties of cooperation under the Railway Concession.\n\n***(ix) Again, breach does not equate to causation of loss***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n623.\n\nHowever, and as noted in the context of the Road Concession, a finding of breach does not necessarily equate to the causation of harm. As discussed further in Section VI.B.4, the Tribunal does not accept Claimants' contention that any breach of the Railway Concession (or of the Road Concession) had the effect of \"causing the termination of the Aabar acquisition and dismantling of the Rasia consortium,\" and thereby of \"render[ing] \u2026 completely worthless\" contractual rights that otherwise had value as of the time of the breach.948 Without such causation, Rasia would not be entitled to recovery of any damages, even if its breach of contract claims had been timely asserted (which the Tribunal has found they were not, *see* Section V.D.3 above).\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6 274.\n\n624.\n\nBefore turning to these issues of causation and loss, however, the Tribunal first examines below the remaining liability claims in this case. They were presented by Mr. Borkowski, and allege violations by Armenia of various BIT obligations that are distinct from its contractual obligations to Rasia under the Concessions.\n\n**B. M****r****. B****orkowski****'****s** **C****laims under the** **BIT** **and** **I****nternational** **L****aw**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Breach of the Umbrella Clause (Article II(2)(C) of the BIT)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n625.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the breach of terms of the Concessions amounts to a violation of the \"umbrella clause\" in the US-Armenia BIT, which has the effect of elevating the Respondent's contractual obligations to international law obligations. According to the Claimants, Article II(2)(c) of the BIT, which offers protection against \"any obligation\" that the Respondent may have entered into \"with regard to investments,\" is among the broadest of umbrella clauses in investment treaty practice and covers contractual obligations entered into by the State.949 Consequently, the Respondent's alleged breach of contractual obligations under the Railway and Road Concessions also constitutes an independent cause of action that the Claimants have against Armenia by virtue of the BIT's umbrella clause.950\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 279, 281.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 278\u201382, 301.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n626.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants' umbrella clause claims are time-barred by Armenia's statute of limitation for contract claims. In any event, the Respondent says, it was Rasia (and not the Respondent) that breached its contractual obligations under the Concessions, and consequently, the Claimants' contractual and umbrella clause claims have no merit.951\n\nResp. First PHB \u00b6 171\u201372, 221; Resp. Second PHB \u00b6\u00b6 27\u201334.\n\n***c. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n627.\n\nThe Tribunal already has found, in Section V.D above, that Mr. Borkowski's umbrella clause claim is time-barred. It has also found, in Section V.B, that even if this were not the case, Mr. Borkowski would not have standing to assert such a claim in circumstances where Armenia entered into the underlying obligations with Rasia, and Rasia itself has no standing to invoke the BIT at all. In these circumstances, there is no need to discuss the merits of the Claimants' argument that Article II(2)(C) of the BIT elevates the Respondent's breach of the Concessions into an independent treaty cause of action, for failure to \"observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"\n\n**(2) Breach of Fair and Equitable Treatment (Article II(2)(a) of the BIT)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent breached its obligations to accord the Claimants' investment fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**) in accordance with Article II(2)(a) of the US-Armenia BIT, which provides that \"Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\"952 The Claimants argue that while the Treaty does not define FET, its meaning\u2014as understood from the preamble of the BIT and tribunal decisions and practice\u2014encompasses objective requirements of good faith, due process, non-discrimination and proportionality. In addition, FET requires that States act in a manner that is just, even-handed, unbiased, legitimate and consistent with legitimate expectations of investors.953\n\nCl.

Second PHB \u00b6 40.\n\n629.\n\nThe Claimants argue that legitimate expectations of investors may arise from contracts with the State and from the undertakings and representations (implicit or explicit) made by the host State. According to the Claimants, legitimate expectations typically include the provision of a stable and predictable environment and the expectation that host States will not arbitrarily revoke pre-existing decisions on which the investor relied to make its commitments.954\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 227.\n\n630.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, in making their investments, they relied on guarantees in relevant agreements as well as written and verbal commitments from the highest levels of the Armenian State, all of which were intended to induce them to undertake substantial risks in connection with the Railway and Road Projects.955\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 230, 234.\n\n631.\n\nSpecifically, Claimants refer to various alleged promises and assurances, without which (they say) they would not have made such investments.

Moreover, the expectations to be taken into account are those existing at the time of the investor's decision to invest in the host State,972 which by definition excludes consideration of subsequent acts. Therefore, the determination of the Claimants' FET claim in this arbitration must be based on the specific assurances upon which Rasia says it relied when it decided to enter into the Concessions.973 The Respondent submits that in this case, none of the Claimants' legitimate expectations was breached.974\n\nResp.

Counter-Mem. \u00b6 279.\n\n*Id*.\n\n636.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that due to the inherent high risks of the Road and Railway Projects, the uncertainty of railway traffic volume and the provisions in the Concession Agreements for termination based on negative feasibility results, the Claimants could have had no reasonable expectation of a return on investment.975 The Respondent contends that there was no expectation or understanding that the Projects would generate a reasonable rate of return, and that no unfavorable change in Armenian legislation within the meaning of the Concession Agreements occurred during Rasia's performance of the Concessions. Further, the Respondent submits that nothing in the Concessions created a legitimate expectation that the Respondent would mitigate delays or other commercial risks to which the Claimants predictably would be exposed.976\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 280\u201384; Respondent's First PHB \u00b6\u00b6 37\u201341, 51.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 422\u201328.\n\n637.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the Concessions specifically exclude any right to consequential/indirect damages or lost profits. Consequently, such putative rights could not be made the subject of an FET claim in this arbitration.977 Third, the Respondent argues that the alleged contractual breaches are not so egregious as to constitute an FET violation.978 Finally, the Respondent argues that it acted transparently by duly responding to Rasia's Freedom of Information Act requests, even though it did not respond directly to Rasia's requests for the Respondent's preferred financing for the Road Project.979\n\nResp.

In any event, the Respondent says, Mr. Borkowski confirmed at the February Hearing that by 7 October 2013 he was well aware of the Respondent's position that Rasia's single toll-free road proposal was not acceptable.984\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 235; Resp.

The Respondent argues that its meetings with Iran were held transparently and with a view to (i) expanding international and transit traffic at the Norduz-Agarak border checkpoints; and (ii) exchanging views on the progress of railway construction and reaching more detailed agreements on the actualization of the project.985 These objectives did not breach any FET obligations owed to the Claimants, the Respondent says.\n\nResp. Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 255\u201356.\n\n***c. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n640.\n\nII(2)(a) of the US-Armenia BIT provides that \"Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\"986\n\nCL-1, BIT Art. II(2)(a).\n\n641.\n\nAs the Parties' submissions recognize, the fair and equitable treatment standard has been interpreted as involving several different elements, which may take on differing degrees of importance in different disputes, depending on the facts and the nature of the wrongs alleged. In this case, there is no need to enunciate any overarching definition of the standard. The Tribunal instead examines the specific theories of an FET breach that Claimants present. As discussed below, they are not proven, based on the facts established in this case.\n\n642.\n\nFirst, Claimants argue that Armenia \"created and reinforced the Claimants' legitimate expectations through express commitments\" in the Concession Agreements, and \"then frustrated those expectations by continuously breaching those commitments \u2026.\"987 As a threshold matter, while a State contract with an investor is certainly a form of \"express commitment,\" this does not mean that every breach of contract will constitute a breach of legitimate expectations.988 Various factors may be relevant to the analysis, including, *inter alia,* (a) the nature of the contract (was it commercial or concluded in exercise of State powers?), (b) the importance or irrelevance of the particular contract provision to inducement of the underlying investment; (c) the nature of the breach (did it repudiate the contract as such, was it taken arbitrarily or in bad faith, etc.?) and (d) the context of the breach (*e.g*., did it occur when the object of the contract otherwise was moving forward, or in the context of the investor's own failure to perform?).\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 229.\n\n*See, e.g.,* RL-30, *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, \u00b6 344 (\"The expectation a party to an agreement may have of the regular fulfilment of the obligation by the other party is not necessarily an expectation protected by international law.\").\n\n643.\n\nHere, there is no doubt that the Concessions were more than ordinary commercial contracts: they involved the use of sovereign authority to grant exclusive rights to develop transportation infrastructure, subject to the Concessionaire's demonstration of the feasibility of the projects described in the Concession and of the availability of funding to deliver on those projects. It also seems clear, as the Claimants contend, that the right to exclusivity was an essential element of the bargain reflected in the Concessions.989 But again, this was contingent on the Concessionaire's demonstration of its own ability to perform.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 579-580.\n\n644.\n\nHowever, the Claimants have not proven their theory of either continuous or egregious breaches of the Concessions, nor have they proven that Rasia itself had performed at the time those asserted breaches took place. To the contrary, the Tribunal has found in Section VI.A.1, with respect to the Road Concession, that Armenia breached the \"No Grant\" provision by contracting with third parties for funding, design and construction works of certain road sections near the Armenian border \u2013 but only after Rasia had admitted that the Road Project as originally envisioned (one that would generate revenue through tolls and pay concession fees to the State) was not feasible, and it had presented a study that contemplated a very different road scheme than that contractually envisaged (one road rather than two, meeting Chinese Class II specifications rather than Armenian Class II specifications).990 With respect to the Railway Concession, the Tribunal has found in Section VI.A.2 that Armenia breached its duty of cooperation when it began exploring whether CCECC might work on the Railway Project, without coordinating this approach through Rasia (which had committed to a different subcontractor, CCCC). But this, too, occurred only after Rasia had failed to deliver the detailed Corridor coordinates promised under the Concession, failed to demonstrate that outside investors were prepared to fund the full costs of the Railway Project and had not communicated with Armenia for many months.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal cannot accept the Claimants' further argument that Armenia breached its obligation under the Road Concession to negotiate in good faith on reasonable measures to render the Road Project Feasible. *See* Cl. Reply \u00b6 575. As the Respondent notes, Rasia itself refused to budge from the core element that rendered the original conception of the Project not feasible, namely that there would be no revenue generated by tolling and therefore no sharing of the burden of financing the road costs. *See* Resp. Rej. \u00b6 429.\n\n645.\n\nIn essence, Armenia had a good faith basis to conclude in both instances that the Projects were not moving forward with Rasia. Its fault lay in failing to take the formal legal steps required under the Concessions to notify Rasia of these conclusions, and to terminate the Concessions as it could have done, before taking steps to explore alternative projects with third parties. While this does constitute a breach of contract, given that the Concessions remained legally in force, it does not represent the kind of fundamental repudiation necessary to establish frustration of legitimate expectations under the fair and equitable treatment standard. A party that fails to deliver its own promised performance under a contract does not have an internationally protected legitimate expectation that its counterparty will remember to execute the required contract formalities to bring the arrangement officially to an end.\n\n646.\n\nThe Claimants' second framing of an FET violation is that \"Armenia's actions ultimately frustrated the Claimants' legitimate expectation to receive a reasonable return on their investments,\" including by a sale or assignment of the Projects to a third party.991 Any expectation at the time of the Concession Agreements that the particular projects described therein would generate returns for Rasia was not objectively reasonable. The two projects described were inherently risky, as the Concession Agreements themselves noted: Rasia was \"assum[ing] substantial financial and commercial risks.\"992 There were no assurances given that either project would prove sufficiently feasible from a technical perspective, or sufficiently attractive from a financing perspective, to move forward at all. Rather, what Rasia obtained through the Concessions was an opportunity, over a specified period of time, to *try* to demonstrate feasibility and bankability. The risk was always on Rasia that it might not be able to do so.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 240.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 15; C-2, Road Concession, Section 15.\n\n647.\n\nThird, the Claimants argue that Armenia violated its FET obligation by \"fail[ing] to provide a stable and consistent environment for their investments.\"993 Such claims usually are put forth in cases involving changes in national law or regulations, but no such changes are alleged in this case.994 Rather, the record reflects at most the cooling of the Respondent's enthusiasm for working with Rasia, after the latter proved unable to follow through in the manner anticipated, first, with respect to a high speed toll road under the Road Concession and then with respect to detailed Corridor coordinates for the Railway Concession. The Respondent no doubt responded to these developments by proposing certain Concession amendments that were unlikely to be received well by Rasia. But hard-nosed counterproposals are neither a breach of contract, as noted above, nor the basis for finding an FET violation.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 235.\n\nFor that reason, the Tribunal need not enter into a jurisprudential debate about the extent to which legal stability is (or is not) part of the FET standard.\n\n648.\n\nFourth, the Claimants contend that Armenia breached a FET obligation to provide a \"transparent legal framework,\" by not providing Claimants with information regarding project status and by conducting \"secret negotiations\" with ADB, CCECC and other third parties.995 In the Tribunal's view, the Claimants' complaint is not about transparency of a \"legal framework\" at all: there is no allegation that Armenia applied some obscure law or regulation to block the Concessions from moving to fruition. Rather, the Claimants seek to rely on the *Tecmed* concept of transparency, which would imply into FET standards an obligation to act \"free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor.\"996 The Tribunal considers that statement to be one of aspiration, rather than a reflection of what international law actually requires. Moreover, on the facts of this case, the Tribunal sees imperfect communications by *both* sides, including extended periods during which Rasia itself went silent vis-\u00e0-vis Armenia, regarding any activities it might be taking to progress the Road and Railway Projects.997\n\nCl.

Counter-Mem. \u00b6 168 (noting that \"Mr. Borkowski \u2026 simply disappeared after 31 December 2014\").\n\n649.\n\nThe Claimants' allegation of \"secret negotiations\" with CCECC is also inconsistent with its concomitant complaint that Armenia demonstrated bad faith by deliberately making *public* statements about its engagement with CCECC, in a \"move \u2026 calculated to scare off any investor.\"998 More generally, the Claimants allege that Armenia violated FET by various acts undertaken, they say, in bad faith; as they would have it, Armenia \"*intended* to defeat the Claimants' investments, and set about achieving that outcome shortly after the conclusion of the Concessions.\"999 As to why Armenia conceivably would so intend \u2013 which is counter-intuitive, if Rasia really were in a position to deliver the Projects \"at its own cost and risk\"1000 \u2013 the Claimants present only one theory. That is that \"Armenia's attempt to exclude Rasia and steal its work product \u2026 appears to have been motivated (at least in the first instance) by a renegade minister [Minister Beglaryan] who \u2026 was angered that his request for bribes had been refused.\"1001 The Tribunal was unable to hear testimony from Minister Beglaryan, who is no longer under the Respondent's direction and control.1002 Nonetheless, Respondent's other Ministry of Transport witnesses have denied any knowledge of such a bribery request.1003 Perhaps more compelling, Rasia presents no contemporaneous evidence corroborating Mr. Borkowski's testimony about the bribery solicitation, such as file notes or internal correspondence. As Respondent notes, Mr. Tappendorf (who claims to have communicated with Mr. Borkowski after the meeting in question) does not mention the alleged bribe request at all.1004 Given the demanding standard for proving corruption and illegality, as well as Mr. Borkowski's observed penchant for exaggerating evidence to try to advance his case (discussed further in Section VI.B.4 below), the Tribunal declines to accept the alleged bribery request as proven, based solely on Mr. Borkowski's uncorroborated testimony that it occurred. As for the Claimants' broader allegation that Armenia \"*intended* to defeat the Claimants' investments,\"1005 the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that this is inconsistent with Armenia's decision on several occasions to extend Rasia's deadline for providing detailed Corridor coordinates under the Railway Concession.1006\n\nCl.

The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n651.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the Respondent subjected their investments to arbitrary measures, contrary to Article II(2)(b) of the US-Armenia BIT, which prohibits the Respondent from \"impair[ing] by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal\" of the Claimants' investments.1008 The Claimants argue that while the BIT does not expressly define \"arbitrary\" measures, the term in its ordinary meaning, and as interpreted by tribunals, includes within its ambit actions carried out capriciously, without reason, motivated by inappropriate considerations or based on \"excess of discretion\" rather than by objective reason or legal standards. It also connotes willful disregard of due process of law.1009\n\nCl.

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n653.\n\nThe Respondent contests the Claimants' argument that it acted arbitrarily by willful breach of the provisions of the Concession Agreements. First, the Respondent argues that there is no record suggesting that the Claimants were pressured, harassed, or bullied over the Respondent's proposed\n\namendment.1013 The Respondent argues that although it followed up on its proposal to the Claimants for amendment, there was no improper conduct, bad faith or breach of the Concessions or BIT on its part in this connection.1014\n\nResp.

The Respondent argues that these statements in fact were justified by Rasia's delay in providing the detailed coordinates for the railway corridor which were required for Armenia to acquire the necessary land for the project. The Respondent also argues that it is not responsible for the comments of independent media organizations or third parties.1015 Further, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not proven their allegations of bad faith, such as an alleged demand for a bribe and steps supposedly taken by the Respondent to frustrate the Concessions.1016\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 200\u2013204; Resp.

The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n655.\n\nArticle II(2)(b) of the BIT prohibits the State Parties from \"impair[ing] by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal\" of covered investments.\n\n656.\n\nThe Tribunal considers arbitrary measures within the framework of the ICJ's definition in *ELSI*, according to which \"arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law. \u2026 It is a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.\"1017 The Tribunal also draws guidance from the *Plama* definition of arbitrary measures as \"those which are not founded in reason or fact but on caprice, prejudice or personal preference,\"1018 and from the definition in *AES v. Hungary*, which examines first \"the existence of a rational policy, which is one \"taken by a state following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter,\" and second whether the challenged act was itself reasonably related to the policy, in the sense of \"an appropriate correlation between the state's public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it.\"1019 As otherwise stated by the *El Paso* tribunal, citing both *ELSI* and dictionary definitions of the word \"arbitrary,\" \"there are always several methods for dealing\" with challenging circumstances in a country, but the issue of arbitrariness examines not \"whether the measures taken were or were not the best, but simply whether they were \"based on a reasoned scheme\" that was itself reasonably connected to \"the aim pursued.\"1020\n\nCL-15, *Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI) (United States of America v.

The Tribunal does not consider the Respondent's acts, within the context in which they occurred, to have been taken arbitrarily, in the sense of without reason. At worst, the Tribunal has found, the Government (a) made aggressive counterproposals for contract amendments after Rasia itself had failed to meet contract terms, by providing a Road Feasibility Study that was inconsistent with the Road Concession and by failing to provide detailed Corridor coordinates for the Railway Project within the applicable contractual deadlines; (b) complained about delays occasioned by Rasia's performance, while simultaneously extending the applicable deadlines (on the Corridor coordinates issue); and (c) ultimately \"jumped the gun\" by moving on to deal with other potential partners (in the case of the Railway, after a long period of not hearing from Rasia at all), without following the contractually required mechanisms for terminating the Concessions. While the latter was a breach of contract under both Concessions, it was not irrational or capricious. One can understand logically how Government officials might have considered the Projects with Rasia essentially \"dead in the water,\" such that they overlooked procedural requirements for contract termination and began to explore potential alternatives in the public interest of improving transportation corridors in Southern Armenia. The Claimants have not proven that the Government's actions were due alternatively to personal *animus* or prejudice, such as that alleged on the part of Mr. Beglaryan after his purported solicitation of a bribe was rejected.\n\n**(4) Indirect Expropriation (Article III of the BIT)**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n658.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the Respondent indirectly expropriated their investments in breach of Article III of the BIT.1021 The Claimants contend that the investments expropriated by the Claimants include contractual rights under the Concession Agreements, notably, the specific know-how furnished by the Claimants for the Projects and rights to exclusivity and transferability, the right to use property and other rights to implement the Projects, which constitute \"property rights\" capable of sale for value and indeed capable of expropriation.1022 According to the Claimants, the Respondent's breach of the Concessions and other actions were pervasive, repudiatory and deprived the Claimants of control and of the value of these investments, thereby amounting to an indirect expropriation.1023\n\nCl.

Thus, according to the Claimants, the threshold for expropriation of contractual rights is that the state's interference with such rights amounts to a deprivation of the investor's economic use and enjoyment of such contractual rights.1024\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 539.\n\n660.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent committed a creeping expropriation through an aggregation of acts that included (i) its unilateral implementation of the Projects with other parties in breach of Claimants' exclusive rights under the Concession Agreements,1025 (ii) the exclusion of the Claimants from bilateral negotiations with Iran concerning the Iran extension of the Railway, and (iii) the dissemination of the Claimants' confidential feasibility study materials to prospective investors without the Claimants' knowledge or consent. These acts, along with other arbitrary actions by the Respondent, are said to have repudiated the Railway Concession, frustrated the prospective acquisition of the projects by Aabar and caused CCCC to withdraw from the transaction.1026 The Claimants argue that the withdrawal of Aabar and CCCC destroyed the projects, because both State-owned firms were strategic avenues to low-cost debt financing of the Railway and Road Projects.1027 According to the Claimants, CCCC had access to low-cost debt from Chinese banks, while Aabar, a sovereign wealth fund with access to an AA credit rating and an indirect subsidiary of the Government of Abu Dhabi, had access to low-cost financing.1028\n\nCl.

The Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to meet the burden of showing (i) a link between the measures in question and substantial deprivation of Claimants' investment or repudiation of rights, and (ii) the occurrence of an effective repudiation of rights or interference with the contract through the exercise of sovereign authority.1029 The Respondent further argues that the *Metalclad* test and the *Waste Management* case (on which the Claimants also rely) are inapposite to this case, and it contends that mere non-performance of a contractual obligation does not amount to expropriation.1030\n\nResp.

According to the Respondent, the Claimants also failed to demonstrate that the studies had any quantifiable value, and how in any event their alleged misappropriation could amount to expropriation rather than a simple breach of contract.1032 In addition, the Respondent argues that Mr. Borkowski's testimony that the CCCC Feasibility Studies are properties of Rasia is contradicted by the terms of the Agreement between CCCC and Rasia, to the effect that the feasibility studies are properties of CCCC until paid for by Rasia.1033 In the same vein, the Respondent submits that Mr. Borkowski's prior assertion in his second witness statement that he had paid for the CCCC Feasibility Studies is contradicted by his subsequent testimony at the February Hearing that he had not yet paid for them.1034\n\nResp.

The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n663.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with a reminder of general principles, namely that the doctrine of expropriation involves deprivation of protected rights in property. As the tribunal in *Emmis* observed, the origin of the term expropriation is the Latin word *expropriat*, from the verb *expropriare*, which contains the root *proprium* (property) as well as the prefix *ex* (out or from). In consequence, a finding of expropriation must be premised on a showing that \"Claimants must have held a property right of which they have been deprived.\"1035\n\n*Emmis International Holding, B.V., et al. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Award, 16 April 2014, \u00b6 159.\n\n664.\n\nThe Parties agree in principle that property rights may emanate from a State contract,1036 but also that not every breach of contract (or poor performance of a contract) results in expropriation of a property right.1037 They appear to agree that a State's effective repudiation of a contract may give rise to an expropriation, at least when undertaken in an exercise of sovereign authority rather than as an ordinary contract counterparty.1038 A fundamental requirement is that the State conduct must have deprived the investor of the right in question, or have rendered the right effectively useless by depriving it of all benefit or value.1039 The latter proposition inherently incorporates an element of causation.\n\nCl.

Counter-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 267-268.\n\n665.\n\nIn this case, the Claimants claim that the Respondent expropriated two separate types of property rights comprising an investment under the BIT: (a) the Concessions as a whole, which were capable of sale or transfer for value, and (b) independently, the \"specific know-how\" that Rasia purportedly developed and conveyed pursuant to the Concessions, reflected in the Feasibility Studies and in its \"consortium approach.\"1040 The Claimants say that Armenia's actions deprived them of the control and value of these separate property rights, in violation of Article III(1) of the BIT.1041 The Tribunal discusses these claims in turn below.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 266-268.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 269.\n\n***(i) No expropriation of property rights in the Concessions***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n666.\n\nThe Claimants' primary expropriation claim concerns the rights reflected in the Concessions. They contend that these rights were not only capable of sale for value, but actually were poised to be sold to Aabar until the Respondent's acts caused the loss of the consortium that Claimants had assembled, and thus deprived the Concessions of the value which was reflected in the Aabar deal price. Specifically, Claimants identify three components that resulted in the deprivation of the value of their investments:\n\n(i) Armenia's measures caused Aabar to abandon its plan to purchase the Railway and Road Projects in early 2015 when it became apparent that Armenia was intent on excluding the Claimants from the Projects.\n\n(ii) Armenia's discussions with the Chinese Government and Chinese entities have irrevocably disrupted the Claimant's efforts to secure debt financing for the Projects by usurping the communication protocol through which the Claimants were to enter into financing agreements with China EximBank.\n\n(iii) Armenia's engagement with other Chinese state entities, notably CCECC, caused the Claimant's turnkey contractor, CCCC to withdraw from the Projects. CCCC was to be the Claimant's avenue to lose-cost debt financing from Chinese export banks. The loss of low-cost Chinese debt financing has rendered the Projects unfeasible.1042\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 275.\n\n667.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, all of this occurred in or around March 2015: \"Aabar terminated its completion of the acquisition of Rasia in March 2015, and CCCC withdrew from Rasia's consortium shortly thereafter. \u2026 Their withdrawal was the death knell for the Projects.\"1043 The significance of the March 2015 date cannot be overlooked, because the Claimants' expropriation theory is pegged directly to the loss of the Aabar transaction,1044 and Mr. Tappendorf was adamant that Aabar ceased to have any interest in the Projects in March 2015.1045 Mr. Tappendorf insists that the transaction was not abandoned as a result of the 1MDB Scandal,1046 even though a halt on non-essential deals was imposed in April 2015 or shortly thereafter.1047 The Claimants insist that, but for Armenia's actions culminating in March 2015, the Aabar deal would have closed, notwithstanding these developments, because it had already been approved by Aabar's Finance and Investment Committee and the necessary funds had been \"ring-fence[d].\"1048\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 551.\n\n*See* Cl. First PHB \u00b6 329 (\"The purpose of the Aabar transaction was to transfer to Aabar all of the property rights associated with the Concessions. Thus, when the Claimants' investments were expropriated by Armenia, the Claimants had nothing to transfer to Aabar, let alone to derive a fruit from.\").\n\nSecond Tappendorf Statement, \u00b6 14 (referring to \"[t]he Aabar Chairman's decision in January 2015 first to freeze the acquisition of Rasia, and the in March 2015 to withdraw from the acquisition altogether\").\n\n*Id*.\n\nFirst Tappendorf Statement \u00b6 21; *but see* Second Tappendorf Statement, \u00b6 84 (contending that the freeze was only implemented for certain deals in April 2015, and gradually extended to all activity in the autumn of 2015).

Aabar Investments PJS*, [2018] EWHC 1627, \u00b6 32.\n\nFirst Thornber Statement \u00b6 36.\n\n668.\n\nThis places a temporal limit on the measures which are said to have led to the alleged expropriation. They must have occurred by March 2015, in order to have caused the impact that the Claimants allege.\n\n669.\n\nIn examining this proposition, the Tribunal starts with a reminder that the Concessions by no means assured the success of the Projects described therein. They simply conveyed rights to try to put together the Projects, at Rasia's \"own cost and risk.\"1049 Looking at the big picture of the Projects, there are several striking improbabilities about the whole venture. First is the notion that a one-man company could develop two massive infrastructure projects, financed at least initially at no cost to the Government, when the company in question had no prior experience in any projects of this sort. The Tribunal is left with the clear impression that Rasia was out of its depth in terms of project design and management, industry and engineering expertise, financial means, and the related processes of maintaining ongoing communication and coordination with its counterparty.\n\nSome of Mr. Borkowski's testimony bordered on the astonishing, such as his concession that the \"no less than $1.1 billion\" cost of the high speed road promised in the Road Concession was a \"number pulled out of thin air,\" just like the route of the proposed road plotted on the map appended as Schedule B to the Road Concession.1050 He admitted that he was \"learning on the fly\" about the process of identifying coordinates for land acquisition purposes, despite having promised such coordinates to the Government at an early stage in the Railway Concession.1051 He disclaimed knowledge about technical matters such as the specifications promised to the Government for a Class II road or the freight volumes anticipated for the railway,1052 but either could not afford, or did not see fit, to retain engineering or other industry expertise to assist him before offering the Government projections or commitments.1053 When it became clear he needed additional support, he asked Aabar to provide him with the funds required \"to fund a development team\" to enable him to obtain and deliver the project financing promised in the Railway Concession.1054 There is nothing in this document to support Mr. Borkowski's explanation at the Hearing that the funding request was for ancillary mining projects along the Railway corridor.1055\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 3; C-2, Road Concession, Section 3.\n\nFebruary Tr.

Day 3, Borkowski, 529:24-531:18, 533:8-538:2.\n\n670.\n\nThe contemporaneous documents reveal Mr. Borkowski's propensity to make claims of support that he had not actually arranged. For example, in the same 13 September 2013 email to Aabar by which he requested funding for his development team, he described the Railway Project, without factual foundation, as already having \"[s]trong government support from Armenia, China, Russia, Georgia and Iran with *public statements of funding support* by Armenia President Sargsyan, Russian President Putin, Georgian PM Ivaishvili, Chinese Premiere.\"1056 The same document described the Railway Project as a \"government-to-government project\" in which \"[c]onstruction will ultimately be government-government funded\" and for which he considered it \"possible to get Armenia government guaranty.\"1057 Mr. Borkowski's explanation at the February Hearing that by \"government-government funded\" he did not mean to imply Armenian government funding, but was referring to potential funding by Chinese banks and Aabar (the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund),1058 was not credible. The whole purpose of the letter was to solicit Aabar's support, so it is illogical that he would describe the project as already having government funding from Abu Dhabi. As for the notion of Russian government support, which Mr. Borkowski repeated to Aabar six weeks later,1059 Mr. Borkowski's explanation on cross-examination that he meant to refer only to SCR as equipment operator,1060 and not to actual \"funding support\" as described in the 13 September 2013 email, is further evidence of his propensity to stretch the facts as needed to suit the circumstances.\n\n*Id.* (emphasis added).\n\nJB-4, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to Mr. M. Al Husseiny and Mr. C. Tappendorf, 13 September 2013.\n\nFebruary Tr.

Borkowski to Mr. M. Al Husseiny and Mr. C.

Day 4, Borkowski, 622:11-18.\n\n671.\n\nIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Mr. Borkowski saw the Road and Railway Projects not as ventures he would see to completion, but rather as opportunities to be promoted and sold on as soon as possible.1061 The problem was that he could not sufficiently advance the Projects to a state that there was in place a credible consortium competent and sufficiently resourced to take the Projects off of his hands and to enable him to cash out. Although there was much talk from Mr. Borkowski about his \"consortium,\" no consortium agreement was ever negotiated and executed. His dealings with CCCC and Aabar strongly suggest that it would have been difficult to form an actual consortium between two companies that both believed they were going to profit from an exclusive EPC contract.\n\nMr. Borkowski claimed that *sub silentio* he and CCCC had built a 5% fee for himself into the $3.2 billion budget for the Railway Concession, which he acknowledged to an \"agency fee,\" \"broker fee\" or \"consulting fee.\" February Tr. Day 3, Hanessian/Borkowski, 550:6-25.\n\n672.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Borkowski's claim for expropriation rests on the proposition that he had already lined up the requisite financing commitments before, on his version of events, the Government's conduct, culminating in March 2015, caused both CCCC's withdrawal (and therefore the loss of any path to China EximBank financing) and the collapse of the acquisition to which Aabar had already committed. As noted above, the Claimants' case is that \"as a result of a series of measures taken by Armenia between the end of 2014 and March 2015 both Aabar and CCCC withdrew from Rasia's consortium.\"1062 But this proposition is not supported by the chronologies relevant either to CCCC/China EximBank or to Aabar.\n\n*See* Cl. First PHB \u00b6 250.\n\n673.\n\nFirst, on the Chinese side, Mr. Borkowski claimed in his first witness statement that \"during the second half of 2013, CCCC informed me that it had *secured* commitments from China EximBank\" for 60% of the Railway financing.1063 As discussed above, however, the Railway Feasibility Study that CCCC prepared did *not* state that any commitments had been secured, only that the Railway Project \"allows for\" and \"currently anticipated\" securing such loans.1064 The loose basis for this anticipation was made clear in Mr. Borkowski's February 2014 presentation to the Government, which was attended by CCCC, which stated that \"[p]reliminary discussions with China banks *assumed*\" 60% financing, but that such financing would be \"[h]ighly dependent on China bank negotiations\" that were still to come.1065 Beyond this presentation, there is no documentation in the record showing any interest being expressed by a Chinese bank, much less any commitment given by one.\n\nFirst Borkowski Statement \u00b6 66 (emphasis added).\n\nC-116, Railway Feasibility Study, pp. 12, 15, 168.\n\nC-131, \"Southern Armenia Railway Project and Southern Armenia High Speed Road Project\" (Razia FZE), February 2014 p. 15 (emphasis added).\n\n674.\n\nSecond, there is no evidence in the record (beyond Mr. Borkowski's testimony) that CCCC's withdrawal of interest was in March 2015, and that it was triggered by Armenia's dealings with CCECC. Mr. Borkowski claimed that CCCC's Mr. Weixin told him by telephone that CCCC was withdrawing because the PRC's Ministry of Commerce had \"ring-fenced\" the Railway Project for the benefit of CCECC.1066 The assertion figures prominently in the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief.1067 But this testimony is the only evidence on this point; Mr. Borkowski acknowledged there is no contemporaneous evidence of this March 2015 conversation.1068 Given the evident importance of such a development, and particularly given that Mr. Borkowski says he retained outside counsel around this time to advise him on what he says was a ripening dispute,1069 one would have expected some contemporaneous notation or reaction to Mr. Weixin's bombshell announcement.1070 Moreover, notwithstanding the obvious relevance and materiality to this arbitration of such a March 2015 conversation (if it occurred), it was not mentioned in any of Mr. Borkowski's witness statements prior to his cross-examination, nor in the Claimants' pleadings until their Post-Hearing Brief. It defies credulity that Mr. Borkowski only remembered his March 2015 conversation with Mr. Weixin in the midst of his hearing testimony. The closest Mr. Borkowski came prior to his hearing testimony to attributing \"CCCC's eventual withdrawal\" to the Ministry's meeting with CCECC in March 2015 was in his second witness statement. But the evidence he cited there was not the claimed telephone call with Mr. Weixin, but rather the Ministry's website's report of the meeting.1071\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 2, Borkowski, 314:9-18. Mr. Borkowski also claimed that Mr. Weixin informed him that a \"formal RFP from the Armenian Ministry of Finance went out to the China Ministry of Commerce requesting for all Chinese companies to participate in making proposals for the railway project and resulting in MoUs being signed with CCECC for both of our projects, the Ministry issued an RFP.\" *Id.*, 313:20-314:18, 332:10-20. This is a detailed allegation, for which there is no documentary evidence in the record, either of a \"formal RFP\" or of a CCECC MoU for the Railway Project.\n\nCl.

Day 2, Borkowski, 290:19-291:3.\n\nThe Respondent observes that the Claimants were able to adduce various emails from Mr. Weixin leading up to 8 February 2015, but there is a complete absence of documentary evidence pertaining to Mr. Borkowski's interaction with Mr. Weixi until 2018. Resp. First PHB \u00b6 12.\n\nSecond Borkowski Statement, \u00b6 131 (claiming that \"Armenia was responsible for CCCC's eventual withdrawal \u2026.

To the contrary, Mr. Borkowski later told Armenian officials that \"things were going well *until about August*\" of 2015.1072 Moreover, Mr. Borkowski's 25 June 2016 Notice of Dispute to Armenia, written some 15 months after the alleged critical events of March 2015, stated that CCCC \"*recently* informed that it intends to terminate contractual agreements with Rasia \u2026.\"1073\n\nR-40, Transcript of the Meeting between A.

Beglaryan, 25 June 2016.\n\n676.\n\nThe claimed withdrawal of CCCC in March 2015 also stands at variance with Mr. Borkowski's letter of 14 October 2015, where he stated that \"Rasia was in the process of negotiating a Framework Agreement with China Poly Group *and involving CCCC* in September 2015\u2026.\"1074 First, Mr. Borkowski's suggestion in this letter that he continued to have dealings with CCCC on the Railway Project through September 2015 is inconsistent with the Claimants' contention in the arbitration that the Ministry's announcement of its March 2015 meeting with CCECC \"clearly signaled to the world, and to any prospective purchaser of Rasia's Projects, that a decision had been taken at the highest governmental levels in Yerevan and Beijing that Rasia and CCCC were out, CCECC was in.\"1075 Moreover, it beggars belief that if Mr. Borkowski really understood the Armenia Railway Project to be cratering in March 2015 on account of the withdrawal of CCCC from his \"consortium,\" that he would have continued to devote energy beyond that date to trying to develop an Iranian railway link to connect at the Armenian border. Nonetheless, that is what he did: in July 2015, Mr. Borkowski arranged for China Poly to visit Iran for nine days to discuss the possibility of an EPC contract with Iran.1076\n\nC-35, Letter from Mr. J.

Borkowski, 21 July 2015; R-129, Email from Mr. J. Borkowski to D. Ning, 26 July 2015.\n\n677.\n\nIn short, the contemporaneous evidence does not support Mr. Borkowski's oral testimony that he was notified of CCCC's withdrawal of interest in the Railway Project in March 2015. Given this fact, as well as Mr. Borkowski's propensity for overstatement as revealed in other respects, the Tribunal does not accept as reliable his uncorroborated testimony about these events.\n\n678.\n\nAs for the alleged destruction of the Aabar transaction in March 2015, the evidence likewise leaves many questions about whether Aabar really was poised to buy Rasia in April 2015, as Claimants contend; whether it really would have proceeded to close on such a deal notwithstanding the general halt on new Aabar investments resulting from the 1MDB Scandal; and whether it really withdrew its interest *because* of the Respondent's acts, which is the central proposition underlying Mr. Borkowski's expropriation claim.\n\n679.\n\nFirst, the claim that Aabar was poised to purchase all of Rasia's equity rests largely on the testimony of Messrs. Tappendorf and Thornber. It is clear that Mr. Tappendorf, at least, was not a disinterested witness. From July 2012, he was a member of Rasia's Investment Advisory Board,1077 and evidently was presented to CCCC as part of Rasia's team, not as a representative of a potential arms' length acquiror; CCCC understood him to be a \"senior director\" of Rasia.1078 Mr. Borkowski communicated with Mr. Tappendorf (and with his superior Mr. al-Husseiny) through their private Gmail accounts, rather than their Aabar accounts.1079 Given the absence of official Aabar emails, and Aabar's winding up following the 1MBD scandal which landed Messrs. al-Husseiny and al-Qubaisi in prison for fraud,1080 there is no way to verify the authenticity of the documents proffered as representing Aabar's contemporaneous readiness to invest in Rasia.\n\nFirst Tappendorf Statement \u00b6 12.\n\nC-96, CCCC, \"Site Visit Report: Southern Armenia High Speed Road Project,\" November 2012, p. 1.\n\nResp.

For example, Mr. Tappendorf testified in his first witness statement that the main reason Aabar's Chairman first put the Rasia purchase on hold in January 2015 was that Armenia had demanded, in November 2014, that the Railway Concession be amended to shift the cost of land acquisition to Rasia.1081 Yet Mr. Tappendorf conceded he knew about this request *before* he presented the proposed acquisition to Aabar's Investment Committee in December 2014,1082 but he had recommended the deal anyway. Either Mr. Tappendorf attributed little significance to Armenia's request at the time \u2013 which weakens the claim that this was a serious contributor to Aabar's growing concerns \u2013 or he did not see fit to bring it to the attention of the Investment Committee in asking them to approve the acquisition. As already discussed, it does not appear that the Investment Committee was ever told about a more basic reason for doubting the wisdom of the investment, namely that Rasia had already committed to give the exclusive EPC role to CCCC (and thus could not commit the same role to Arabtec).1083 This issue would have immediately come to a head had they sought to negotiate an actual consortium agreement among the potential partners.\n\nSecond Tappendorf Statement \u00b6 14.\n\nFebruary Tr. Day 5, Hanessian/Tappendorf, 889:11-18.\n\nC-145, Aabar, Term Sheet, 18 December 2014 (not identifying the Rasia-CCCC Framework Agreement as one of the documents reviewed). Mr. Tappendorf testified that there nonetheless were \"quite extensive communications\" about Arabtec and CCCC working together, which is not credible, among other things because Mr. Borkowski testified that there were never any such communications. *Cf.* February Tr. Day 3, Borkowski, 553:17-22; Day 5, Mr. Tappendorf, 844:25-845:7.\n\n681.\n\nThere are other oddities about the proposition that the Respondent's acts culminating in March 2015 were responsible for the Aabar acquisition not moving forward. For example, Mr. Tappendorf had recommended back in September 2014 that the drafting of any definitive agreements with Rasia be deferred until the signing of a trilateral cooperation memorandum between Rasia, Armenia and Iran, \"ensuring Iran linkages will be in place.\"1084 This was a logical precondition given that the value of the Railway Project clearly depended on being able to carry freight traffic into Iran.1085 Yet although Iran signed the Iranian Trilateral MOU in November 2014, that document did not come close to \"ensuring\" an Iran link for the Southern Armenian Railway. To the contrary, Iran stated in that document that it would undertake to build a railway segment on its territory only after \"the project progress by value achieves 30% in the Republic of Armenia territory.\"1086 This created a difficult \"chicken and egg\" problem: to obtain financing for the Southern Armenian Railway, Rasia needed to show the certainty of a Iranian link, but the Iranian link would not be undertaken until the Southern Armenian Railway had progressed substantially. There is no persuasive explanation of why Aabar \u2013 which in September 2014 had identified the importance of \"ensuring Iranian linkages will be in place\" before moving forward with any Rasia deal \u2013 would have been willing to move ahead anyway on the deal in April 2015, despite this impasse remaining in place. The evidence also indicates that both Mr. Borkowski and Mr. Thornber of Aabar continued even in September 2015 \u2013 months *after* the purported destruction of Rasia's investment in March 2015 \u2013 to explore ways of generating movement on the Iranian railway segment, by meeting together with China Poly about its potentially becoming the exclusive EPC contractor for the Iranian segment.1087\n\nCT-7, Memorandum from Mr. C.

Borkowski to D. Ning, 17 September 2015 (referencing a meeting \"with me and the aabar Investments CFO\").\n\n682.\n\nAs for Rasia's contention that the Aabar deal with Rasia would have closed in April 2015, notwithstanding the general halt in new Aabar investment put in place at that time, the Claimants overlook a final critical fact: that pursuant to the Concession Agreements themselves, Rasia's ability to close on any equity transaction, by which its shares would be sold to any third party, was contractually subject both to Armenian Government review1088 and an Armenian Government right of first refusal.1089 There is no evidence that Rasia ever notified the Government that it had reached an agreement in principle with Aabar, much less that it requested the Government to review the proposed transaction and to waive its right of first refusal. Yet both of these processes would have had to be concluded in order for Aabar to proceed with any acquisition of Rasia. And certainly, once the 1MBD scandal engulfed Aabar, the Armenian Government could not reasonably be faulted for objecting to Aabar as its putative new Concession partner, even if (*arguendo*) Aabar itself might have been willing to proceed despite its overall turmoil.\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 8.2 (regulating any potential \"alienation\" of Rasia, the direct or indirect shareholding interest in Rasia, and Rasia's \"rights and assets related to the Project,\" and subjecting any such alienation to conditions including acceptability of the acquiror to the Government on grounds of national security, and confirmation that the acquiror would be able to provide continuity and proper progress on the Project); C-2, Road Concession, Section 8.2 (same).\n\n*Id.* (\"the Government shall enjoy rights of first refusal in acquiring shareholding interest in the Concessionaire, including in case of increase of the equity capital, except for any acquisition of the shareholding interest through open auction or any other public tender process\").\n\n683.\n\nIn short, the evidence does not support the Claimants' contention that the Project rights bestowed by the Concessions had substantial value as of 2015, which Rasia would have realized through the Aabar transaction, but for the Government's alleged wrongful acts. Rather, it appears that the Projects collapsed for other reasons. With respect to the Road Project, CCCC concluded that projected usage did not support the use of tolling to generate revenue, which was a central feature of the original Project conception, and without that feature, the Government had no obligation to move forward. There is no causal link between the Government's moving forward with alternative road projects (even though that breached the Road Concession in the absence of any effective contract termination) and the Road Project's underlying failure. With respect to the Railway Project, Rasia was presented with a Gordian knot which tied the fate of financing to Iran's willingness to move forward, which Iran in turn tied to seeing concrete progress on the Armenian side. This contradiction proved impossible to resolve. It was the main reason for the Railway Project's failure. In these circumstances, there was no expropriation by Armenia of any inherent or residual value of the two Projects, whether reflected through an Aabar acquisition price or otherwise. Simply put, Armenia's conduct did not destroy any Project rights of cognizable value.\n\n***(ii) No expropriation of property rights in the Feasibility Studies***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n684.\n\nThe Claimants assert that independent of the alleged expropriation of the Project rights, the Respondent expropriated \"the Claimants' work product.\" This allegedly occurred well after the Projects collapsed \u2013 \"[i]n October 2016 and January 2017\" \u2013 when Armenia \"appropriated, repackaged and widely disseminated the Claimants' confidential feasibility study information in order to attract new investors to the Projects.\"1090 More precisely, the Claimants say that they \"furnished specific know-how\" by \"commissioning feasibility studies and assembling a consortium to deliver the Projects,\"1091 but Armenia subsequently used for other purposes \"key financial data, technical specifications and the proposed railway alignment\" from the Railway Feasibility Study.\"1092 In addition, the Respondent is said to have expropriated the Claimants' \"consortium approach,\" by \"proceeding to engage with Chinese entities\" like CCECC to prepare a feasibility study, and thus \"usurp[ing] the communications protocol with Chinese banks.\"1093\n\nCl.

The Claimants had no property right in the idea of working with Chinese construction companies on an infrastructure project, in order to harness the connections of such companies as a pathway to obtain Chinese bank financing.\n\n686.\n\nThe Claimants' first contention, about the Respondent's alleged collateral use of technical information set out in the Railway Feasibility Study, requires more discussion. First, the Claimants are correct that the Railway Concession did not grant the Respondent the right to use any \"proprietary or confidential information (including specifications, plans and drawings)\" provided to the Government pursuant to the Concession.1094 The Respondent's obligations of confidentiality did not apply to information that was \"already lawfully in [its] possession or lawfully known\" to it prior to disclosure.1095\n\nC-1, Railway Concession, Section 70.1.\n\n*Id*., Section 70.2(e).\n\n687.\n\nThe evidence demonstrates that in October 2016, Mr. Arakelyan used some of the same data contained in the Railway Feasibility Study in a presentation he provided to the Armenian Investment Forum in New York. Specifically, as the Claimants note, his presentation contains the same figures about predicted freight volumes, passenger traffic and transit cargo.1096 The presentation also used the same figures that had appeared in the Railway Feasibility Study in respect of the Railway Project's projected financial internal rate of return and a financial net present value.1097 However, before setting out any of this data, the October 2016 presentations explicitly (though inaccurately) referred to the Government's Railway Concession with Rasia, and to CCCC's Railway Feasibility Study prepared under contract with Rasia.1098 The presentation therefore may be said to have attempted to give Rasia and CCCC attribution for the data used, even if the Government did so without seeking Rasia's advance permission.\n\nCl.

In the absence of any evidence about CCCC's sources for the figures in the Railroad Feasibility Study, the Tribunal cannot make particularized findings about which figures resulted from its independent analysis and which did not. The Tribunal however accepts in principle that at least *some* of the information likely did so, and the Government then used that information in its presentations, without Rasia's prior consent.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 415.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 146.\n\n690.\n\nHowever, even assuming *arguendo* that the Government breached its contractual duty of confidentiality to Rasia under the Railway Concession, this does not establish expropriation of intellectual property comprising an \"investment\" of Rasia's under the BIT. While intellectual property is capable of expropriation, the property in question *must belong to the investor* protected by the BIT. The BIT does not provide standing for U.S. investors to assert expropriation claims regarding property owned by third party nationals. In this case, while the Claimants often loosely referred to the data in question as *their* know-how, the more accurate description is that reflected in their statement that they \"furnished\" know-how by \"commissioning\" studies by others, namely CCCC.1104 However, the terms of the \"commissioning\" in question \u2013 defined by the CCCC Railway Commercial Agreement \u2013 expressly provided that CCCC would retain ownership of the Railway Feasibility Study, and all intellectual property rights in that Study, until Rasia paid an agreed \"Services Fee\" to acquire such rights. The fact that Rasia incurred a debt to pay this fee in future did not provide it with any present rights to the content of the Study; the CCCC Railway Commercial Agreement is explicit that \"any CCCC work that has been completed, but not paid for, will remain its property.\"1105\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 267.\n\nR-67, Commercial Agreement for Feasibility Study on the Southern Armenia Railway, 10 December 2012, \u00b6 5.\n\n691.\n\nAs discussed in Section V.A.3 above, Rasia has never paid CCCC for either of the Feasibility Studies. It therefore is not the owner of any intellectual property rights reflected in those Studies. In these circumstances, the Claimants have not proven that any breach by the Respondent of its contractual confidentiality obligations amounted to an expropriation of property rights that belonged to Mr. Borkowski, in violation of Article III of the BIT.1106\n\nFor avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal also finds that Mr. Borkowski cannot sidestep his lack of ownership of the underlying information, by defining the property right allegedly expropriated as simply his contractual right to confidentiality under the BIT. A contractual right to confidentiality regarding intellectual property owned by third parties does not constitute a separate \"investment\" akin to intellectual property itself.\n\n**VII. CAUSATION AND DAMAGES**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **C****laimants****' P****osition**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n692.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, but for the Respondent's acts that led to Rasia's and CCCC's ouster from the Projects by March 2015, Aabar would have acquired and financed the Projects and led their successful construction and long-term operation.1107 The Claimants argue that Aabar's withdrawal resulted in the loss of the acquisition and of the favourable financing terms that Aabar would have been able to secure, and that the Claimants are entitled to full reparation equivalent to the value of the Projects.1108\n\nCl. Second PHB \u00b6 132.\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6 313.\n\n693.\n\nThe Claimants state that their compensable losses equate to the fair market value (\"**FMV**\") of the Projects as of March 2015, which they quantify at US$225 million.1109 This is derived from the price at which Aabar agreed to acquire the Projects through acquiring Rasia, discounted to present value and \"to account for the uncertainty of future EPC and royalty fees being paid.\"1110 The Claimants rely on the Aabar Term Sheet dated 18 December 2014 in this respect and claim that it represents the best evidence of the Projects' FMV.1111 The Claimants argue that, pursuant to the Aabar Term Sheet, they would have received US$70 million for the Railway Project (seven times the cost of the Railway Feasibility Study) and US$35 million for the Road Project upon closure of the transaction, *i.e.* US$105 million in cash (the \"Upfront Payment\").1112 In addition, the Claimants would have received US$139 million over a six-year period by virtue of a 5% consulting fee on the value of CCCC's EPC contract, as well as US$475 million over a 30-year period in revenue royalties, corresponding to 3% of the total annual revenue for the railway.1113 The Claimants' expert, Mr. Sequeira, discounted the forecasted cash flows to Rasia of these amounts to 18 March 2015.1114\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 311; Cl.

The Claimants submit that Aabar's vetting process meets these criteria.\n\nCl. Second PHB \u00b6 134.\n\n695.\n\nThe Claimants state that the reliability of the acquisition price agreed by Aabar is supported by: (i) Aabar's intimate involvement in the establishment and organization of the Projects for over three years; (ii) internal documents showing financial modelling and strategic assessments, investment memoranda and other evidence concerning the due diligence process, including Mr. Tappendorf's and Mr. Thornber's testimony at the February Hearing, to the effect that Aabar carefully assessed the anticipated risks and returns of the Projects; (iii) CCCC's reliance on the Respondent's own data with regard to its NPV estimate and key assumptions; (iv) CCCC's assessment regarding railway traffic volumes in the Feasibility Study, which was corroborated by third-party evidence, *e.g.*, a projection by SCR; (v) the fact that Aabar had insight into, and control over, future oil volumes by virtue of IPIC's ownership of Spain's CEPSA, one of the largest European importers of oil from Iran, thus giving confidence that the Railway Project could meet the transit volume projections in the Feasibility Study; and (vi) Mr. Sequeira's confirmation of Aabar's and CCCC's NPV assessments, based on comparisons with other railways in the region.1116 The Claimants add that the Tribunal can adjust the Aabar offer price to the extent that it considers any adjustment appropriate \"to reconcile the particularities of the Aabar acquisition terms to its perception of the hypothetical fair market price.\"1117\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 135\u201344.\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6 323.\n\n696.\n\nThe Claimants refute the Respondent's suggestion that Aabar's acquisition was lightly taken and therefore that its contemplated purchase price cannot be accepted as a reliable measure of FMV. In the Claimants' view, the Respondent's expert's, Mr. Winner's, reassessment of the Railway Project as having a negative NPV is fatally flawed, as (i) he made arbitrary reductions to the railway traffic volumes and tariff rates that are not supported by any evidence or analysis; (ii) he wrongly assumed that the Railway Project would be owned and operated by private sector investors, as opposed to an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund; (iii) his model relied on a distorted WACC, which was not the financing contemplated by Aabar and did not take into account financing by an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund; and (iv) he had double-counted costs and made other major substantive modelling errors in his financial analysis of the Railway Project, as highlighted by Mr. Sequeira.1118\n\nCl. Second PHB \u00b6\u00b6 146\u201375.\n\n697.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, they seek damages for the direct loss that they suffered arising from deliberate acts by Armenian officials and say they do not seek damages for the loss of profit with regard to the Aabar acquisition.1119 The Respondent therefore cannot rely on Section 57 of the Concession Agreements, which purports to exclude \"profit loss, indirect and consequential losses.\"1120 The Claimants' loss is the totality of their property rights in the Concessions and the destruction of their value, as the Claimants were left with nothing to transfer to Aabar after the investments were expropriated by Armenia.1121\n\nCl. First PHB \u00b6 328.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 327.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 329.\n\n698.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the breaches of the Concessions were intentional and therefore compensable under Article 417(4) of the Armenian Civil Code (1998).1122 Even if Armenia did not purposefully seek to harm the Claimants by destroying the value of the Projects, by voluntarily choosing illegal conduct, its actions constitute intentional breaches under Armenian law.1123 The Claimants contend that these intentional breaches have been proven beyond any doubt at the February Hearing.1124 However, even if the Claimants' damages claim were deemed to be a demand for \"profit loss\" or indirect or consequential losses within the meaning of the exclusion in the Concession Agreements, they contend that the indemnification clauses of the Concessions cannot limit the Respondent's obligation to provide full compensation to the Claimants.1125 Article 9 of the Foreign Investment Law of Armenia provides that unlawful State action \"shall be subject to immediate compensation\" for \"damages, including lost profits.\" This is *lex specialis* and cannot be contracted out of under general contract law, as confirmed by Article 437(4) of the Civil Code of Armenia.1126\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 332.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 333.\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 334.\n\nCl.

Even if there were a breach of the Concessions or the Treaty, the Claimants have failed to show that, but for Armenia's actions, the Projects would have gone forward.1128\n\nResp. Second PHB \u00b6 139.\n\n701.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Aabar's withdrawal from the acquisition had nothing to do with Armenia. As testified by Mr. Tappendorf, in April 2015, Aabar froze all its new investment activities because of the resignation of its Chairman, Mr. al-Qubaisi. This was independent of the Projects and ended any possibility of Aabar's investment.1129 Therefore, the Respondent contends the Claimants' damages claim \"must fail for lack of causation.\"1130\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 140.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6\u00b6 140-141.\n\n702.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants' damages claim is an attempt to recover putative profits that Mr. Borkowski says he would have earned had he been able to sell Rasia to Aabar. Such indirect or consequential damages are barred by the Concessions and Armenian law.1131 Pursuant to Article 17 of the Armenian Civil Code, \"[a] person whose right has been violated may demand full compensation for the losses caused to it unless statute or contract provides for compensation for losses in a lesser amount.\"1132 In this respect, the Concession Agreements specify at Section 57 that \"profit loss, indirect and consequential losses of the indemnified Party\" are excluded.1133\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 142.\n\nRL-82, Excerpts of the Civil Code of the Republic of Armenia, 1 January 1999.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 467.\n\n703.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, under Armenian law, Aabar's offer is just an \"assumption\" or \"speculation\" of events in the future and cannot be characterized as \"actual damages.\"1134 It is incorrect to say that the consideration paid for the Concessions would have substituted for the assets in Claimants' hands and cannot be seen as mere \"profit,\" as Aabar was going to buy Rasia, and only indirectly the Projects, and the Claimants paid nothing for the Concessions.1135 The Claimants also cannot rely on Article 9 of the Foreign Investment Law for damages in this case, as that Law provides that \"other legislation of the Republic of Armenia and international treaties\" apply.1136 In the Respondent's submission, the Foreign Investment Law cannot override the limitation in the Concessions, as Article 437(4) of the Armenian Civil Code (which the Respondent argues is applicable as such \"other legislation\" referenced in the Law) provides that parties are free to contract otherwise, as the Parties in this case have done in the Concessions.1137 In addition, the Respondent notes that the Claimants have not brought any claim under the Foreign Investment Law. Accordingly, any damages must be limited to any direct, actual damages suffered by the Claimants, which are not supported by any evidence.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 470, referring to the Court of Cassation of the Republic of Armenia, Case No. EKD/3296/02/14, 27 December 2017, RL-87.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 474.\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 477; RL-80, The Law of the Republic of Armenia on Foreign Investments, 31 July 1994, Art. 2.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 477.\n\n704.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Mr. Borkowski is also precluded from claiming damages under the BIT. To the extent that the Tribunal finds that there is an investment, such investment is the Concession Agreements, governed by national law. Mr. Borkowski's bundle of rights and his damages for Treaty claims must therefore be limited in the same manner as under the Concessions and Armenian law.1138\n\n*Id*. \u00b6 484.\n\n705.\n\nIn any event, according to the Respondent, the Claimants' claim for damages is too speculative, as it relies on a single, uncommunicated and unconsummated, non-binding indicative offer.1139 The Respondent says that the Claimants' expert, Mr. Sequeira, agrees that the only document exchanged between Aabar and Rasia was Aabar's letter of 21 September 2013 entitled \"Expression of Interest.\"1140 According to Mr. Sequeira, this offer was later formalized in the Aabar Term Sheet, but the sheet was never provided to Mr. Borkowski, as admitted by Mr. Tappendorf.1141 The Respondent submits that there was no independent due diligence nor evidence in support of the allegation that the transaction was near completion, and the Claimants cannot rely on the Aabar Term Sheet given the preliminary status of the transaction.1142 The Respondent argues there is no precedent to award damages on the basis of a single non-binding unconsummated indicative offer, and distinguishes cases relied on by the Claimants in this respect.1143\n\nResp.

Rej. \u00b6 542.\n\n707.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that Aabar's indicative offer to purchase Rasia cannot reflect the market value of the Projects, as (i) it is based on unreasonable conclusions in CCCC's Railway Feasibility study, which were not supported by any documentary evidence of due diligence made beyond modelling different debt assumptions, and which took into account tariff rates that were too high to be competitive; (ii) the Road Project was not projected to generate revenue; (iii) the railway had a USD 1.9 billion negative NPV and 1.05% negative Internal Rate of Return; (iv) there is no commercial precedent for a privately-financed Railway Project without any form of State guarantee, due to revenue risks associated with railway projects; (v) the valuation method reflected in the Aabar offer \u2013 multiplying the alleged cost of CCCC's feasibility studies by seven to arrive at an upfront payment of $105 million \u2013 was arbitrary and there is no evidence that it reflected market terms; (vi) there is no evidence that the additional 5% construction fee and the 3% revenue fee on the Railway Project reflected market terms; (vii) the damages calculation did not appropriately discount the Aabar offer to take into account associated risks; and (viii) it was not a market offer, which the Claimants effectively concede as they state that Aabar was uniquely placed to acquire the Projects and invite the Tribunal to adjust their claim for factors unique to Aabar.1145\n\nResp.

In Section VI.A.2, the Tribunal found that Armenia breached its duty of cooperation under the Railway Concession beginning in the third quarter of 2015, when it began exploring in earnest the possibility that CCECC might construct the Southern Armenia Railway, without coordinating this approach through Rasia (which had promised EPC rights to CCCC). At the same time, the Tribunal found in Section V.D.3 that Rasia presented its claims for breach of contract too late for them to be actionable, under the statute of limitations reflected in the Armenian Civil Code.\n\n710.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Borkowski's claims under the BIT, the Tribunal has found the umbrella clause claims to be time-barred (*see* Section V.D.3), and that Mr. Borkowski has no standing to assert such claims in any event, given that Armenia's obligations were not entered into with respect to him (*see* Section V.B.3). With respect to the other BIT claims that Mr. Borkowski properly may assert, the Tribunal has found no conduct by Armenia that violates its obligations under the BIT with respect to American investors or their investments. In essence, Armenia's fault lies in concluding (for good reason) that the Projects were not moving forward with Rasia, but then failing to take the formal legal steps required to terminate the Concessions as Armenia could have done, before taking steps to explore or undertake alternative projects with third parties. While this does constitute a breach of contract, given that the Concessions remained in force, it does not represent the kind of arbitrary or unreasonable conduct necessary to establish a violation of the BIT's fair and equitable treatment or arbitrary measures clauses, as explained in Sections VI.B.2 and VI.B.3. As for expropriation, the Tribunal does not equate a breach of failing but still formally persisting Concessions with a taking of an investment, in circumstances where the Concessions simply conveyed rights to try to put together certain Projects, and the Concessionaire ultimately proved itself unable to do so according to the applicable terms. As explained in Section VI.B.4, Mr. Borkowski has not proven that the Respondent's acts were responsible for Aabar's decision not to go forward in April 2015 with an acquisition of Rasia's shares. Nor has he proven that Rasia had any viable alternative way of obtaining value from its Concession rights. In other words, no expropriation occurred, because Armenia did not destroy any rights of cognizable value.\n\n711.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal nonetheless confirms that even if the Tribunal had not found the breach of contract claims to be time-barred, it would not have found causation of any damages, for the same reasons explored in the expropriation analysis. The Respondent's decision eventually to explore alternative road and railway projects with third parties was not the reason why the Projects contemplated in the Concessions collapsed, nor were they the reason why Aabar did not end up acquiring Rasia's shares. The Claimants have not presented any other theory of damages, because they adduced no evidence that they ever expended any funds on either Project. Thus, in the absence of any proven causation, there would be no basis for any award of damages, even if Rasia's contract claims had been timely asserted (*quod non*).\n\n**VIII.

Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n721.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n722.\n\nGiven the outcome of this proceeding, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that the Claimants bear the full costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant, and ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses. These amount to the following (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses | $439,005.66 |\n| Ms. Jean Kalicki | $204,562.50 |\n| Mr. John Beechey CBE | $76,037.76 |\n| Mr. J. Christopher Thomas KC | $158,405.40 |\n| Assistant's fees and expenses | $43,793.75 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | $210,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses (estimated) | $161,500.27 |\n| **Total** | $854,299.68 |\n\n723.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.1159 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to US$427,149.84. Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimants to reimburse the Respondent US$427,149.84 for the expended portion of the Respondent's advances to ICSID.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n724.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers it appropriate that the Claimants reimburse the Respondent for 75% of the Respondent's legal fees and expenses, excluding category 1 of the claimed expenses (the Respondent's advances to ICSID, which are addressed in the prior paragraphs) and category 4 of the claimed expenses (the claim for US$59,975 on account of the time spent by Government personnel, which the Tribunal does not consider warranted). The Tribunal does not award the Respondent full recovery of its other categories of legal fees and expenses, because it has found that Armenia breached the Concessions in some respects, even if Rasia asserted its contract claims too late and no damages have been proven to flow from the particular breaches of which it complained. Taking all factors into account, the Tribunal orders the Claimants to reimburse the Respondent for 75% of categories 2, 3 and 5 of its legal fees and expenses, namely 75% of US$3,141,467, an amount of US$2,356,100.25.\n\n**IX.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis annulment proceeding concerns an application for annulment of the award rendered on January 20, 2023 (the \"**award**\") in the arbitration proceeding between Rasia FZE and Joseph K. Borkowski and the Republic of Armenia (ICSID Case No. ARB/18/28) (the \"**Arbitration**\") by an arbitral tribunal composed of Ms. Jean E. Kalicki, Mr. John Beechey and Mr. J. Christopher Thomas (the \"**Tribunal**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe applicants on annulment are Rasia FZE (\"**Rasia**\"), a company incorporated in the United Arab Emirates, and Mr. Joseph K. Borkowski (\"**Mr. Borkowski**\"), a natural person having the nationality of the United States of America (together, the \"**Applicants**\" or the \"**Claimants**\"). The Respondent on annulment is the Republic of Armenia (\"**Armenia**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"). The Applicants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"Parties\", and their representatives and addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n3.\n\nThe Award decided on a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of (a) the 2012 Southern Armenia Railway Concession Agreement (the \"**Railway Agreement**\") and the 2012 Southern Armenia High Speed Road Concession Agreement (the \"**Road Agreement**\"), both dated July 28, 2012, which Rasia and the Respondent entered into in relation to two related projects in southern Armenia (together, the \"**Concession Agreements**\"), (b) the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of Armenia Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, which entered into force on March 29, 1996 (the \"**USA-Armenia BIT**\" or the \"**BIT**\") as well as (c) the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute in the original Arbitration related to the Respondent's series of actions and inactions in relation to these two projects in southern Armenia, designed to improve infrastructures in Armenia, that allegedly violated provisions in the Concession Agreements (*vis-\u00e0-vis* Rasia) and the USA-Armenia BIT (*vis-\u00e0-vis* Mr. Borkowski). The Claimants' claims included alleged violations with regard to fair and equitable treatment, arbitrary treatment, and expropriation. They also advanced umbrella clause claims.\n\n5.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal dismissed all of the Claimants' claims and ordered that the Claimants pay the Respondent USD 2,783,250.09, comprising USD 427,149.84 for the expended portion of the Respondent's advances to ICSID and USD 2,356,100.25 towards the Respondent's legal fees and expenses. The Award's operative part reads as follows:1\n\n*(1) Armenia's objection* ratione materiae*, on the basis of the non-existence of an investment, is denied;*\n\n*(2) Rasia's claims for breach of the Concession Agreements are denied as time-barred under the statute of limitations applicable to those agreements;*\n\n*(3) Mr. Borkowski's claim for breach of Article II(2)(c) of the BIT (the umbrella clause) is denied as similarly time-barred and also because Armenia did not enter into any obligations with Mr. Borkowski, and he has no standing to assert a claim under Article II(2)(c) with regard to obligations entered into with Rasia;*\n\n*(4) Mr. Borkowski's claims for breach of Articles II(2)(a), II(2)(b) and III of the BIT (fair and equitable treatment, arbitrary measures and expropriation) are denied on the merits;*\n\n*(5) Accordingly, the Claimants' claims for damages on account of alleged breaches of the Concession Agreements and the BIT are denied;*\n\n*(6) Orders that the Claimants pay the Respondent US$2,783,250.09, comprising US$427,149.84 for the expended portion of the Respondent's advances to ICSID and US$2,356,100.25 towards the Respondent's legal fees and expenses; and*\n\n*(7) Denies all other relief sought by both Parties.*\n\nAward, \u00b6 725, A-0001-ENG.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimants applied for annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, identifying three grounds for annulment: (i) manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b)); (ii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and (iii) failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn May 19, 2023, ICSID received an application for annulment of the Award dated May 19, 2023 from the Applicants (the \"**Application**\"), together with Factual Exhibits A-1 through A-35, Legal Authorities AL-1 through AL-37 as well as an expert report on Armenian law by Adelaida Baghdasaryan dated May 19, 2023 and its supporting exhibits AB-1 to AB-20 (the \"**Baghdasaryan Report**\"). The Application also contained a request under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\") for the stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application was decided (the \"**Stay Application**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn June 2, 2023, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 50(2), the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application. On the same date, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the enforcement of the Award had been provisionally stayed.\n\n9.\n\nOn June 15, 2023, the Parties were informed of the Secretary-General's intention to propose to the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council (the \"**Chairman**\") the appointment to the *ad hoc* Committee of Ms. Loretta Malintoppi, a national of the Italian Republic, as President, Prof. Hi-Taek Shin, a national of the Republic of Korea and Ms. Adedoyin Oyinkan Rhodes-Vivour, a national of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as Committee Members. The Parties were invited to submit any observations related to this proposal by June 23, 2023.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 26, 2023, having confirmed that the Parties had not submitted any observations regarding the proposed appointment, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Chairman would proceed to appoint Ms. Loretta Malintoppi, Prof. Hi-Taek Shin and Ms. Adedoyin Oyinkan Rhodes-Vivour.\n\n11.\n\nOn July 4, 2023, the Centre informed the Parties that the *ad hoc* Committee was constituted in accordance with Arbitration Rules 6 and 53. Its Members are Ms. Loretta Malintoppi (President), a national of the Italian Republic, appointed to the Panel by the Chairman, Prof. Hi-Taek Shin (Member), a national of the Republic of Korea, appointed to the Panel by the Republic of Korea, and Ms. Adedoyin Oyinkan Rhodes-Vivour (Member), a national of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, appointed to the Panel by the Federal Republic of Nigeria (the \"**Committee**\"). The Members of the Committee were appointed by the Chairman. On the same date, the Parties were further notified that Mr. Yuichiro Omori, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n12.\n\nOn July 11, 2023, the Committee wrote to the Parties regarding the First Session of the annulment proceeding and provided a draft version of Procedural Order No. 1 for their comments. In that letter, the Committee invited the Applicants to confirm whether they maintain their Stay Application, and further invited the Applicants to submit a written request to introduce the Baghdasaryan Report into the record by July 18, 2023, and the Respondent to submit its observations on the Applicants' such request by July 25, 2023. The Committee's latter invitation was made \"*[i]n view of paragraph 15.4 of the draft Procedural Order No. 1 [sent to the Parties on July 11, 2023]*\" which in turn required, for new evidence to be admitted in this proceeding, that special circumstances exist based on a reasoned written request followed by observations from the other party.\n\n13.\n\nOn July 18, 2023, as directed, the Applicants confirmed their availability for the First Session. The Applicants also informed the Committee that they maintained their Stay Application and that they would confer with the Respondent regarding the timetable. The Applicants further formally requested that the Baghdasaryan Report be admitted into the record of this proceeding (the \"**Baghdasaryan Report Request**\"), without providing its reasons. On the same date, the Respondent confirmed its availability for the First Session.\n\n14.\n\nOn July 25, 2023, the Respondent objected to the admission of the Baghdasaryan Report \"*as a general matter*\" and noted that it could not object with specific arguments as the Applicants had not provided arguments or reasons as to why it should be admitted.\n\n15.\n\nOn July 26, 2023, the Committee invited the Applicants to submit written reasons for the Baghdasaryan Report Request by August 1, 2023, and the Respondent to submit its written observations by August 8, 2023. The Parties were also invited to further address this matter orally during the First Session.\n\n16.\n\nOn August 1, 2023, the Applicants submitted written reasons for their Baghdasaryan Report Request.\n\n17.\n\nOn August 3, 2023, the Parties sent to the Committee their comments on the draft Procedural Order No. 1, which contained their respective timetables on the Stay Application. The Parties further proposed that this matter be addressed at the First Session.\n\n18.\n\nOn August 6, 2023, the Applicants sent a letter to the Committee in support of their Stay Application.\n\n19.\n\nOn August 7, 2023, the Committee invited the Respondent, if it so wished, to provide its comments on the Applicants' letter of August 6, 2023 or to address the elements raised in the said letter orally during the First Session.\n\n20.\n\nOn August 8, 2023, the Respondent provided its response to the Applicants' letter of August 6, 2023 regarding the Stay Application. On the same date, the Respondent also filed with the Committee its written observations on the Applicants' August 1, 2023 letter concerning the Baghdasaryan Report Request.\n\n21.\n\nOn August 9, 2023, in accordance with Arbitration Rules 53 and 13(1), the Committee held its First Session with the Parties by videoconference. During the session, the Parties presented oral arguments on the matter of the Baghdasaryan Report Request and the Stay Application.\n\n22.\n\nFollowing the First Session, on August 23, 2023, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Committee on disputed issues (\"**PO1**\"). PO1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington D.C., United States of America. PO1 also sets out a procedural calendar for the proceeding, and prescribes in its paragraphs 15.3 and 15.4 as follows:\n\n*15.3. Given the nature of an annulment proceeding, the Committee expects that the parties will refer primarily to the evidentiary record from the arbitration proceeding and it does not expect to receive new evidence (exhibits, witness statements or expert reports).*\n\n*15.4. Therefore, without prejudice to each party's right to submit new legal authorities, no new evidence shall be admitted in this proceeding, unless the Committee determines that exceptional circumstances exist based on a reasoned written request followed by observations from the other party. For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee confirms that the rules under this paragraph apply to the Applicants' request to introduce the Baghdasaryan Report in this annulment proceeding, on which the Committee will render its ruling in due course.*\n\n23.\n\nOn August 24, 2023, the Applicants filed their Application for Annulment and Memorial dated August 23, 2023 (the \"**Memorial**\"), with factual exhibits A-0001 to A-0035,2 legal authorities AL-0001 to AL-0037 and the Baghdasaryan Report.3\n\nFactual exhibit A-0026-ENG was uploaded onto Box by the Applicants on September 11, 2023.\n\nThe Applicants noted that \"[t]his bundle contains the Baghdasaryan Report and its accompanying exhibits, subject to the Committee's ultimate ruling on its inclusion\".\n\n24.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent submitted its Opposition to the Stay of Enforcement dated August 24, 2023 (the \"**Stay Opposition**\"), along with a factual exhibit RA-0001 and legal authorities RALA-0001 to RALA-0010.\n\n25.\n\nOn August 29, 2023, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 dismissing the Applicants' Baghdasaryan Report Request given that exceptional circumstances as required under PO1 were not found (\"**PO2**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn September 8, 2023, the Applicants filed their Reply on Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement dated September 7, 2023 (the \"**Stay Reply**\"), and their cumulative index.\n\n27.\n\nOn September 12, 2023, the Committee invited the Applicants to formally submit the legal authority cited in the Stay Reply and, if they so wished, the legal authorities cited in the Applicants' letter of August 6, 2023, in accordance with the requirements prescribed in PO1. The Applicants were also invited to submit an updated cumulative index including these legal authorities.\n\n28.\n\nOn September 13, 2023, the Applicants submitted their updated cumulative index which included the following items: (i) factual exhibits A-0001 to A-0035 and legal authorities AL-0001 to AL-0037, filed with the Memorial; (ii) A-0036 and A-0037, filed with the Stay Reply; and (iii) AL-0038 to AL-0040, filed in response to the Committee's invitation of September 12, 2023.\n\n29.\n\nOn September 21, 2023, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Stay of Enforcement (the \"**Stay Rejoinder**\") and its cumulative index, along with factual exhibits RA-0002 to RA-0005 and legal authorities RALA-0011 to RALA-0012.\n\n30.\n\nOn September 29, 2023, the Applicants submitted a letter regarding their Stay Application, together with their cumulative index and a factual exhibit A-0038. On the same date, the Committee invited the Respondent to provide its comments on the Applicants' such letter by October 3, 2023.\n\n31.\n\nOn October 3, 2023, as directed, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Applicants' letter of September 29, 2023 regarding the Stay Application.\n\n32.\n\nOn October 4, 2023, without receiving the Committee's invitation to do so, the Applicants sent an email to the Committee in response to the Respondent's October 3, 2023 letter.\n\n33.\n\nOn October 5, 2023, the Committee informed the Parties that it did not consider that the Parties' further submissions on the Stay Application were required to render its decision. The Committee also reminded the Parties to comply with the prescriptions of PO1, including its Annex B on procedural timetable.\n\n34.\n\nOn October 16, 2023, the Committee issued its Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award dated October 16, 2023 (the \"**Stay Decision**\"), in which it decided and directed in paragraph 99 that:\n\n*a. The provisional stay of enforcement is extended until the date of the Committee's decision on the Application for Annulment, so long as the Applicants, within forty-five days of the date of this Decision, furnish to the Committee an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond for the full amount due under para. 725(6) of the Award (USD 2,783,250.09) (the \"instrument\") inclusive of all applicable interests accrued to the date of issuance of the instrument.*\n\n*b. The instrument must be issued by a first-tier reputable credit institution and must be immediately payable to or cashable by the Respondent upon the presentation of a decision rejecting the Applicants' annulment application, withdrawal of the Application for Annulment, or discontinuance of this annulment proceeding. Furthermore, the instrument shall provide that, in the event that the Committee upholds the Award, the amount payable to the Applicants shall equal the amount under para. 725(6) of the Award, plus interest accrued as of the date of the instrument as applicable. A copy of the executed instrument shall be provided to the Committee and to the Respondent.*\n\n*c. Within seven days of receipt of the executed instrument, the Respondent shall provide to the Committee (with a copy to the Applicants) any comments on whether the instrument meets the conditions specified by the Committee in this Decision. If the Committee wishes to receive additional comments from either Party, it shall request so.*\n\n*d. The stay of enforcement shall be lifted sixty days after the date of this decision if the Applicant has not [sic] furnished the instrument as described above by that date.*\n\n35.\n\nOn October 17, 2023, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment (the \"**Counter-Memorial**\"), together with factual exhibits RA-0006 through RA-0012 and legal authorities RALA-0013 through RALA-0021.\n\n36.\n\nOn November 30, 2023, the Applicants submitted a letter and an electronic copy of a document entitled \"*Demand Guarantee*\" issued by Lazarus Capital Partners (\"**Lazarus**\"), signed both by its Managing Director and Director (the \"**Demand Guarantee**\"), together with an account statement evidencing the funds. The Demand Guarantee had an expiration date of December 25, 2024, and provided in its relevant part as follows:\n\n*3. Immediately upon the ICISD Annulment Committee's decision becoming final, and provided the Applicants' application to annul the Award is unsuccessful in full, we irrevocably undertake to pay the Beneficiary upon receipt of a written demand, the sum of two million seven hundred eighty three thousand two hundred fifty and 9/100 U.S. Dollars ($2,783,250.09) or such lesser amount as may be requiring, following the Annulment Committee's decision. The maximum amount of this Guarantee is two million seven hundred eighty three thousand two hundred fifty and 9/100 U.S. Dollars ($2,783,250.09).*\n\n37.\n\nOn December 1, 2023, the Committee invited the Respondent to comment, in accordance with paragraph 99.c of the Stay Decision, on whether the documents filed by the Applicants met the required conditions, by December 7, 2023.\n\n38.\n\nOn December 7, 2023, the Respondent provided its comments on the Applicants' Demand Guarantee, challenging its adequacy on multiple grounds.\n\n39.\n\nOn December 8, 2023, the Committee invited the Applicants to submit their comments on the Respondent's observations by December 15, 2023.\n\n40.\n\nLater that same day, the Applicants provided their comments on the Respondent's observations of December 7, 2023, reiterating that the Demand Guarantee satisfied the requirements as set out in the Stay Decision. The Applicants stated that they were \"*in advanced discussions with Aon plc, a global professional services and management consulting firm, for the placement of a security bond with Intact Financial Corporation, a global property and casualty insurance company*\", and added that they were at the Committee's disposal should the option of a security bond be preferable.\n\n41.\n\nOn December 12, 2023, the Committee invited the Respondent to provide, by December 18, 2023, its observations on the Applicants' statement that they would be prepared to place a security bond with Intact Financial Corporation under the terms described in their letter of December 8, 2023.\n\n42.\n\nOn December 18, 2023, as directed, the Respondent provided its observations on the above-mentioned matter regarding the security bond. The Respondent did not oppose the Applicants' statement but requested that \"*any security bond include the Committee's directive language, rather than stating (as the Applicants had done) that the annulment decision must be 'final,' or including an artificial termination date of the bond*\".\n\n43.\n\nOn the same date, the Parties informed the Committee that they had agreed to a one-day extension of the deadline for the Applicants to file their reply on annulment and the corresponding changes to the procedural timetable. On December 19, 2023, the Committee agreed to the proposed extension.\n\n44.\n\nOn December 19, 2023, the Applicants filed their Reply on Annulment (the \"**Reply**\"), along with factual exhibits A-0039 to A-0045.\n\n45.\n\nOn December 22, 2023, the Committee issued its Revised Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award (the \"**Revised Stay Decision**\"), in which it decided that:\n\n*27. [\u2026] the Demand Guarantee does not meet the requirements of the Stay Decision.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*31. [\u2026]*\n\n*a. The Applicants shall produce an unconditional and irrevocable security bond for the full amount due under para. 725(6) of the Award (USD 2,783,250.09) inclusive of all applicable interests accrued to the date of issuance of the instrument (\"Instrument\") within forty-five days from the date of this Decision. The Instrument shall not contain an expiration date.*\n\n*b. The Instrument must be issued by Intact Financial Corporation, or another first-tier reputable credit institution of similar standing, and must be immediately payable to or cashable by the Respondent upon the issuance of a decision rejecting the Applicants' annulment, withdrawal of the Application for Annulment, or discontinuance of this annulment proceeding. Furthermore, the Instrument shall provide that, in the event that the Committee upholds the Award, the amount payable to the Applicants shall equal the amount under para. 725(6) of the Award, plus interest accrued as of the date of the Instrument. A copy of the executed instrument shall be provided to the Committee and to the Respondent and in full satisfaction of the Award.*\n\n*c. The stay of enforcement shall be lifted sixty days after the date of this Decision if the Applicant has not furnished the Instrument as described above by that date.*\n\n*d. The Committee reserves its right to revisit at any time its decision or order, at the request of either Party or by own its motion, to vary or amend its decision or order.*\n\n*e. The Committee reserves its decision on costs for a subsequent stage of the proceeding.*\n\n46.\n\nOn January 19, 2024, the Applicants filed a letter and an electronic copy of a document labelled \"*Security Bond*\" (Bond No. 800140501) dated January 18, 2024 issued by Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company, a surety underwriting company of Intact Financial Corporation, signed by its Attorney-in-Fact Sara Owens (the \"**Security Bond**\"), together with a power of attorney and its accounting statement as of 31 December 2022. The Security Bond did not bear the Applicants' signature.\n\n47.\n\nIn the said letter, the Applicants stated that they required assistance in terminating the Demand Guarantee as the Revised Stay Decision was insufficient to cancel it and therefore requested that the Committee issue an order directing that the Demand Guarantee be terminated.\n\n48.\n\nOn January 24, 2024, at the request of the Committee, the Applicants resubmitted the Security Bond bearing their signature.\n\n49.\n\nOn January 25, 2024, the Committee issued its New Decision on Stay of Enforcement and Termination of Demand Guarantee issued by Lazarus Capital Partners (the \"**New Stay Decision**\"). Its dispositive part reads as follows:\n\n*a. The Security Bond satisfies the requirements set forth in the Revised Stay Decision.*\n\n*b. The Demand Guarantee shall be terminated.*\n\n*c. The stay of enforcement of the Award is maintained pending the Committee's decision on the Applicants' application for annulment.*\n\n*d. The Committee reserves its right to revisit at any time its decision or order, at the request of either Party or by own its motion, to vary or amend its decision or order.*\n\n*e. The Committee reserves its decision on costs for a subsequent stage of the proceeding.*\n\n50.\n\nOn February 22, 2024, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Annulment (the \"**Rejoinder**\"), along with factual exhibits RA-0013 through RA-0018 and legal authorities RALA-0022 through RALA-0029.4\n\nThese documents, including the factual exhibits and legal authorities, were uploaded onto Box by the Respondent on March 27, 2024.\n\n51.\n\nOn March 28, 2024, the Committee provided to the Parties with a draft version of Procedural Order No. 3 on the organization of the hearing (\"**Draft PO3**\"), inviting them to consult and revert to the Committee by May 6, 2024 with any agreements and/or disagreements that they might have on Draft PO3.\n\n52.\n\nOn April 29, 2024, the Committee received an application from Counsel for Mr. Edmond Khudyan (\"**Mr. Khudyan**\") to make a submission as a non-disputing party dated April 29, 2024 (the \"**NDP Application**\"). On the same date, on behalf of the Committee, the Committee Secretary transmitted the NDP Application to the Parties and invited them to provide any observations on the NDP Application by May 9, 2024.\n\n53.\n\nOn May 6, 2024, as directed, the Parties filed their comments on Draft PO3.\n\n54.\n\nOn May 9, 2024, the Respondent filed its observations on the NDP Application. On May 10, 2024, at the Committee's request for clarification, the Applicants submitted their observations on the NDP Application.\n\n55.\n\nOn May 14, 2024, the Committee sent to the Parties a revised version of Draft PO3.\n\n56.\n\nOn May 20, 2024, a pre-hearing organizational meeting was held by video conference.\n\n57.\n\nOn May 23, 2024, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the organization of the hearing (\"**PO3**\").\n\n58.\n\nOn the same date, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 4 containing the Committee's decision on the NDP Application (\"**PO4\"**).\n\n59.\n\nOn May 28, 2024, the Committee invited the Parties to indicate whether they consented to the transmission of PO4 to Mr. Khudyan, by May 30, 2024.\n\n60.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, the Respondent objected to the transmission of PO4 to Mr. Khudyan. The Applicants did not respond to the Committee's invitation of May 28, 2024.\n\n61.\n\nOn June 12, 2024, the Committee proposed that the Committee provide Mr. Khudyan with the relevant legal reasoning of PO4 on the condition that Mr. Khudyan would provide a confidentiality undertaking, and invited the Parties to comment on the Committee's such proposal by June 19, 2024. On the same date, the Applicants informed the Committee that it had no objection to the Committee's proposal. On June 19, 2024, the Respondent informed the Committee that it did not object to the Committee's proposal.\n\n62.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, the Applicants requested that the Committee allow the addition of a new exhibit into the hearing bundle as exhibit A-0046-ENG.\n\n63.\n\nA hearing on annulment was held in Washington D.C., the USA on July 2 and 3, 2024 (the \"**Hearing**\"). The following persons were present at the Hearing:\n\n*Committee*:\n\nMs. Loretta Malintoppi President In-person  \nProfessor Hi-Taek Shin Member of the Committee In-person  \nMs. Adedoyin Oyinkan Member of the Committee In-person  \nRhodes-Vivour\n\n*ICSID Secretariat*:\n\nMr. Yuichiro Omori Secretary of the Committee In-person\n\nMs. Jaidat Ali Djae Paralegal In-person\n\n*For the Applicants*:\n\nMr. Mark McNeill Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP In-person  \nMr. Odysseas Repousis Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP In-person  \nMr. Charles Rice Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP In-person  \nMr. Varoujan Avedikian TK Partners In-person  \nMr. Joseph Borkowski Applicant Remote\n\n*For the Respondent*:\n\nMr. Teddy Baldwin Alliance Law Partners, LLP In-person  \nProf. Dr. Frederic Sourgens Washburn University In-person   \nDr. Liparit Drmeyan Respondent's Counsel / Representative In-person  \nMs. Kristine Khanazadyan Respondent's Counsel / Representative In-person  \nMs. Parandzem Mikayelyan Respondent's Counsel / Representative In-person  \nMs. Mariam Tarverdyan Respondent's Counsel / Representative Remote  \nMs. Maria Hovhannisyan Respondent's Counsel / Representative Remote\n\n*Court Reporter*:\n\nMs. Rose Tamburri Court-Reporter In-person\n\n64.\n\nDuring the 1st day of the Hearing, the Parties orally presented their respective positions on the Applicants' request to introduce a new exhibit into the record of this annulment proceeding. The Committee rejected the Applicants' such request orally during the Hearing.\n\n65.\n\nOn July 15, 2024, the Committee informed the Parties that it had received sufficient submissions and evidence from the Parties, and therefore it did not find it necessary to receive a post-hearing brief from the Parties or to ask post-hearing questions to the Parties.\n\n66.\n\nFollowing the signing of the confidentiality undertaking by Mr. Khudyan and his counsel, on August 21, 2024, the Committee transmitted relevant portions of the legal reasoning of PO4 to Mr. Khudyan.\n\n67.\n\nOn August 12 and 13, 2024, at the invitation of the Committee, the Parties filed their respective submissions on costs.\n\n68.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on August 29, 2024.\n\n69.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Applicants' submission on costs.\n\n70.\n\nOn September 6, 2024, at the invitation of the Committee, the Applicants submitted their response to the Respondent's August 29, 2024 submission.\n\n71.\n\nOn September 13, 2024, the Committee informed the Parties that it did not require further information from the Parties with regard to their costs submissions.\n\n**III. HE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**(1) (The Applicants' Requests for Relief)**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Applicants seek the following reliefs in their Application5 and Memorial:6\n\n*(i) STAY enforcement of the Award;*\n\n*(ii) ANNUL the Award in full; and*\n\n*(iii) ORDER Armenia to bear all costs of these annulment proceedings, including the cost of the Applicants' legal representation, as well as all costs of the Applicants in the Arbitration proceedings, with interest.*\n\nApplication, \u00b6 145.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 145.\n\n73.\n\nIn their Reply, the Applicants seek the following reliefs:7\n\n*(i) ANNUL the Award in full; and*\n\n*(ii) ORDER Armenia to bear all costs of these annulment proceedings, including the cost of the Applicants' legal representation, as well as all costs of the Applicants in the Arbitration proceedings, with interest.*\n\nReply, \u00b6 130.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Requests for Relief**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent requests, in its Counter-Memorial, that the Committee render a decision:8\n\n*193.

Ordering any other relief that the* ad hoc *Committee deems appropriate.*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 1-4 of p.86.\n\n**IV. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Applicants seek annulment of the Award on the following grounds as set out in Articles 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention:10\n\na. The Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\nb. The Tribunal has made a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and\n\nc. The Tribunal failed to state reasons on which the Award is based.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n\n77.\n\nThe Committee will first deal in Part A with the Applicants' request for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention for a manifest excess of powers, followed by the Applicants' request under Article 52(1)(d) for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in Part B, and finally the Applicants' request under Article 52(1)(e) for the Award's failure to state reasons in Part C.\n\n**A. Ground 1: Manifest Excess of Powers (Article 52(1)(B))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Applicable Legal Standard of Review for Manifest Excess of Powers (Article 52(1)(b))**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Applicants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe Applicants submit that an excess of power occurs where a tribunal deviates from the parties' agreement to arbitrate, and in particular if a tribunal (i) wrongly asserts its jurisdiction over a dispute, (ii) fails to exercise its jurisdiction properly, or (iii) applies the wrong rules of law in disregard of the parties' choice of rules to apply to their dispute.11\n\nApplication, \u00b6 66; Memorial, \u00b6 66; Reply, \u00b6 33.\n\n79.\n\nThe Applicants assert that the term \"*manifest*\" has been interpreted as \"*obvious*\" or \"*serious*\", or \"*if it can be discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis*\". In the context of a tribunal's application of the correct law, it is the Applicants' position that an excess of power is manifest if a tribunal (i) makes an incorrect determination as to whether an issue is subject to national or international law, and its erroneous choice in that regard is outcome-determinative; (ii) has identified the correct rules of law, but has so grossly misinterpreted and misapplied them as to be tantamount to the application of the wrong rules of law; or (iii) failed to consider whether the conduct complained of constituted a breach of the underlying investment treaty or other instruments governing the dispute.12 At the Hearing, the Applicants further contended that the Parties appear to agree that applying a \"different test\" constitutes an annullable error.13\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68; Reply, \u00b6 33.\n\nTranscript Day 2, pp. 247-249, however, the Applicants accept that the Respondent specifically required \"ill intent\" for it to be annullable. *See also* Applicants' slides used during their rebuttal presentation at the Hearing (\"**Applicants' Rebuttal Statement**\"), p. 22, arguing that \"[t]he Parties appear to agree that providing a 'different test' is an annullable offence\".\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nConcerning the requirement of an \"*excess of power*\", the Respondent argues that the jurisprudence submitted by the Applicants in support of their arguments is inapposite. In the Respondent's view, the Tribunal exercised the jurisdiction it had when it dismissed the Applicants' claims on the basis of the limitations period.14\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 99.\n\n81.\n\nWhile the Respondent accepts the Applicants' contention that \"*appl[ying] the wrong rule of law in disregard of the parties' choice of rules to apply to their dispute*\" would result in the excess of a tribunal's power, it maintains that the standard requires proof of the failure to apply the applicable law, as opposed to an imperfect interpretation or application of the applicable law.15 The Respondent agrees with the finding of the annulment committee in *Soufraki v. UAE*, submitted by the Applicants, that a \"*distinction must be made between the failure to apply the proper law, which can result in annulment, and an error in the application of the law, which is not a ground for annulment*\".16 The Respondent does not disagree with the Applicants' position that an error must make \"*a difference to the result*\" for an award to be annullable.17\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 100, referring to Application, \u00b6 66 and Memorial, \u00b6 66.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 100, 104-105; *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision of the *Ad Hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of Mr. Soufraki (June 5, 2007) (\"***Soufraki v. UAE***\"), \u00b6 85, AL-0003-ENG.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 102; Rejoinder, \u00b6 81.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent further relies on the *ad hoc* committee's finding in *Alapli v. Turkey* that *\"\u2026it is not the role of an annulment committee to verify whether the tribunal's interpretation of the law or assessment of the facts was correct*\" and therefore \"*[a]s long as the tribunal correctly identified the applicable law, and strove to apply it to the facts that it established, there is no room for annulment*\".18 It further draws the Committee's attention to the ruling of the *Tulip v. Turkey* committee that \"[a]d hoc *committees cannot review an award's findings for errors of fact or law*\".19 The Respondent highlights that weighing of factual evidence and the drawing of evidentiary conclusions is a matter within the Tribunal's competence and therefore cannot be a valid annulment ground for an excess of power.20\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 152-157; Rejoinder, \u00b6 111, referring to *Alapli Elektrik BV v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/13 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision on Annulment (July 10, 2014) (\"***Alapli v. Turkey***\"), \u00b6 234, RAL-0019-ENG.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 152-157, referring to *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands BV v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28 (Annulment Proceeding)*,* Decision on Annulment (December 30, 2015) (\"***Tulip v. Turkey***\"), \u00b6 44, AL-0005-ENG.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 111. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 141.\n\n83.\n\nWith regard to the requirement of \"*manifest*\", the Respondent acknowledges that one way to interpret manifestness is for it to mean obviousness, as the Applicants argue. However, the Respondent disagrees with the *ad hoc* committees' findings in *Sempra v. Argentina* and *Enron v. Argentina*, both introduced by the Applicants, as \"*[t]hese two decisions more than most have led to an erosion of trust by participants in the ICSID system in the ICSID annulment mechanism*\".21\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 159-160.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Parties agree that \"*appl[ying] the wrong rule of law in disregard of the parties' choice of rules to apply to their dispute*\"22 would result in the excess of a tribunal's power and that they both rely on the *Soufraki* annulment decision holding that \"*a distinction must be made between the failure to apply the proper law, which can result in annulment, and an error in the application of the law, which is not a ground for annulment*\".23\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 66; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 100.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 68, 89; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 68, 89; Reply, \u00b6 33; Applicants' slides used during their opening presentation at the Hearing, as corrected on the same date (\"**Applicants' Opening Statement**\"), p. 5; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 100, 104-105; *Soufraki v. UAE*, \u00b6 85, AL-0003-ENG. *See also* Transcript Day 1, 46:7-48:4.\n\n85.\n\nAs to the requirement of \"*manifestness*\" under Article 52(1)(b), the Applicants argue that the word \"*manifest*\" has been interpreted as being roughly synonymous with \"*obvious*\" or \"*serious*\".24 For its part, the Respondent does not appear to disagree with this rather uncontroversial definition but argues that the Applicants do not submit any argument on how the Tribunal's conduct shows that it \"*manifestly*\" exceeded its powers.25\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 67, referring to Rudolf Dolzer and Christoph Schreuer, Principles of International Investment Law (2d ed. 2012), p. 304, AL-0018-ENG and *Soufraki v. UAE*, \u00b6 41, AL-0003-ENG (\"[t]*o exceed the scope of one's powers means to do something beyond the reach of such powers as defined by three parameters, the jurisdictional requirements, the applicable law and the issues raised by the Parties*\").\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 98.\n\n86.\n\nThe Committee finds that an excess of powers is \"*manifest*\" when it can be easily discerned \"*with little effort and without deeper analysis*\"26 or when it is \"*self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other*\".27\n\nChristopher Schreuer, et al., The ICSID Convention, A Commentary (2nd ed.), 2009 (\"***Schreuer 2nd Commentary***\"), \u00b6 135, AL-0017-ENG.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision on the Application by the Arab Republic of Egypt for Annulment of the Arbitral Award dated December 8, 2000 (February 5, 2002) (\"***Wena Hotels v. Egypt***\"), \u00b6 25, AL-0028-ENG.\n\n87.\n\nFailure to apply the proper law can constitute a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b). Some committees have stressed in that regard that a fine line exists between a failure to apply the proper law and its erroneous application. Thus, the issue may prove to be rather complex in actual practice and committees differ as to whether an egregious error in the application of the proper law may amount to a failure to apply the proper law. In this regard, the Committee shares the view of the *ad hoc* committee in *Soufraki v. UAE* which in particular held as follows:\n\n*ICSID ad hoc committees have commonly been quite clear in their statements \u2013 if not always in the effective implementation of these statements \u2013 that a distinction must be made between the failure to apply the proper law, which can result in annulment, and an error in the application of the law, which is not a ground for annulment.* [\u2026]\n\n*Misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law may, in particular cases, be so gross or egregious as substantially to amount to failure to apply the proper law. Such gross and consequential misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law which no reasonable person (\"bon p\u00e8re de famille\") could accept needs to be distinguished from simple error \u2013 even a serious error \u2013 in the interpretation of the law which in many national jurisdictions may be the subject of ordinary appeal as distinguished from, e.g., an extraordinary writ of certiorari.* [\u2026]\n\n*It seems hardly necessary to add that failure to apply the proper law must also be distinguished from failure to apply the proper law to the true or correct facts. Errors in a tribunal's findings of facts, generated by, for instance, acceptance of evidence of no or insufficient probative value, do not provide a ground for annulment, save where such errors constitute or result in \"a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention*[\u2026]28\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE*, \u00b6\u00b6 85-87, AL-0003-ENG (footnotes omitted).\n\n88.\n\nThe Committee thus considers that failure to apply the applicable law is a ground for annulment, but the incorrect application or interpretation of that law, or an *error in judicando*, by a tribunal does not constitute a manifest excess of powers.\n\n89.\n\nIn applying this legal standard in Section (2)c below, the Committee will first determine whether the Tribunal committed an excess of powers because if failed to apply the proper law and, if so, it will ascertain whether the excess of powers was also \"*manifest*\".\n\n**(2) Application of the Legal Standard for Manifest Excess of Powers (Article 52(1)(b))**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Applicants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n***(a) Argument 1: The Tribunal erred by importing a procedural prescription period from Armenian law into the ICSID Arbitration***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Applicants submit that the Tribunal wrongly applied provisions of the Armenian Civil Code concerning the limitations period, which is strictly procedural under Armenian law, despite the fact that the Parties only consented to apply the \"*substantive Legislation*\" of Armenia in the Concession Agreements.29\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 80-82; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 80-82; Reply, \u00b6 45.\n\n91.\n\nFor the Applicants, issues pertaining to statutes of limitations in ICSID arbitration are jurisdictional defenses which are governed by international law only. In the Applicants' view, since the Parties deliberately agreed to apply only the \"*substantive*\" legislation of Armenia in the Concession Agreements and carved out procedural rules from their choice of law clause, provisions concerning limitations period in the Armenian Civil Code were inapplicable and did not reinter the arbitration by virtue of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.30 The Applicants draw the Committee's attention to, *inter alia*, Article 168 of the Civil Procedure Code entitled \"*[m]otion on applying a statute of limitations and its examination at a preliminary court session*\" and conclude that provisions on limitations periods are procedural in nature under Armenian law.31 Consequently, the Applicants claim that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by both (i) applying the wrong rules of law; and (ii) failing to exercise its jurisdiction.32\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 83-86; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 83-86; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 46-51. *See also* Application, \u00b6 75(ii); Memorial, \u00b6 75(ii).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62. *See also* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51 in which the Applicants refer to the dispute resolution clause of the USA-Armenia BIT.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 87-88; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 87-88; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\n92.\n\nThe Applicants reject the points raised by the Respondent in the Counter-Memorial, as follows: (i) prescription defense is considered as jurisdictional in ICSID arbitrations, and not an admissibility defense because, *inter alia*, the ICSID Convention does not contain different rules for jurisdiction and admissibility, such a distinction would effectively render ICSID awards immutable, and that the limitations period defence was not addressed as an admissibility issue in the Award, as evidenced from its structure;33 (ii) in any event, the distinction between jurisdiction and merits is irrelevant to the Committee's determination of whether an excess of power by the Tribunal existed in this case;34 (iii) the Tribunal's conclusion that claims were \"*extinguished*\" is inconsistent with an admissibility ruling and amounts to re-writing the Concession Agreements by robbing the Applicants' of an opportunity for redress in ICC arbitration; and (iv) the Parties were free to agree to apply any part of the Armenian Civil Code to their dispute, which they did in the Concession Agreements, and therefore the limitations period under the Armenia Civil Code was inapplicable in this case. There is no rule that the Armenian Civil Code must either be applied in full or not at all, as the Respondent falsely contends.35\n\nApplicants made this argument in the discussion devoted to the legal standard for manifest excess of powers in their written submissions. *See also* Transcript Day 1, 113:10-114:17.\n\nTranscript Day 1, pp. 111-114.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 53-57; Applicants Opening Statement, pp. 40-41. *See also* Reply \u00b6 34, in which the Applicants asserted the issue (i) also under the \"III. LEGAL STANDARD FOR ANNULMENT\" section.\n\n***(b) Argument 2: The Tribunal grossly misinterpreted and misapplied the Armenian prescription period***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Applicants submit that even assuming that the Armenian limitations period could somehow be imported into ICSID arbitration, the Tribunal grossly erred by misinterpreting and misapplying it in this case.36\n\nApplication, \u00b6 89; Memorial, \u00b6 89; Reply, \u00b6 58.\n\n94.\n\nFirst, the Applicants contend that, while pursuant to Armenian law Armenian statutes must be interpreted in accordance with the literal meaning of the words contained therein,37 the Tribunal misinterpreted and misapplied this provision by adding an additional requirement that there must be an acknowledgment of a \"*wrongdoing*\", which can be found nowhere in the Armenian Civil Code and against the text of the provision.38 Based on this misapplication of the law and despite the existence of ample contemporaneous evidence showing the Respondent's explicit and repeated acknowledgement of its existing obligations under the Concession Agreements, the Tribunal erroneously held that the limitations period was not interrupted and dismissed the Applicants' claims.39\n\nTranscript Day 1, 30:7-19. *See also* Applicants' Opening Statement, p. 8, referring to Article 8 of the Armenian Civil Code, A-0043-ENG, and Article 86 of the Law on Legal Acts of Armenia, A-0045-ENG.\n\nTranscript Day 1, 42: 6-21, 74:11-79:6.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 90-96, 99;

(ii) the Respondent's statements allegedly made during the meeting on March 18, 2016; (iii) the Respondent's email of April 5, 2016; and (iv) the Respondent's statements arguably made during the meeting on July 3, 2017.48\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 102-104;

Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 52, 105; Reply, \u00b6 81.\n\n99.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, Article 333(1) of the Armenian Civil Code, which should have been applied by the Tribunal, provides that the limitations period shall be 10 years in cases where the injury is alleged to have resulted from corrupt actions in the course of the entry into, and performance of, transactions in the manner prescribed by the Civil Code.52\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 105-106; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 105-106; Reply, \u00b6 82.\n\n100.\n\nThe Applicants argue that, although their claims in the Arbitration were fundamentally based on corrupt actions by the Respondent's government officials, the Tribunal failed to consider the impact that these allegations might have had on the limitations period. While admitting that the Applicants did not bring this provision to the Tribunal's attention during the Arbitration, the Applicants criticize the Respondent for not raising this point before the Tribunal despite Armenia's strong policy against corruption, and further state that this provision cannot be waived by any Party due to this strong public policy. Accordingly, the Applicants assert that, even if the Armenian limitations period could be imported into the Arbitration, the limitations period in this case would not lapse until 2025.53\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 108-109; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 108-109; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 60, 84-85.\n\n101.\n\nThe Applicants further take issue with the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 4 for deciding not to compel the testimony of the Respondent's ex-Minister allegedly involved in the corrupt actions, Mr. Beglaryan, in contrast to its Procedural Order No. 7 compelling a member of the Claimants' consortium, Mr. Weixin, to testify at the Arbitration hearing. For the Applicants, this amounted to unequal treatment of the Parties.54\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 110-112; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 110-112; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 84, 86-88.\n\n102.\n\nThird, the Applicants aver that the Tribunal erred in finding that the limitations period in this case started running on March 18, 2015,55 because it should not have commenced until a later date.56\n\nApplication, \u00b6 113; Memorial, \u00b6 113. *See also* Application, \u00b6 52; Memorial, \u00b6 52.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 113, 118; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 113, 118.\n\n103.\n\nThe Applicants criticise the Tribunal for ignoring facts occurred after March 18, 2015, which allegedly show that the Applicants' investments were destroyed by the Respondent's series of actions between November 2012 and May 2019 collectively.57 In any event, the Applicants state that it was only on July 27, 2017 that the Respondent unilaterally terminated the Concession Agreements by issuing a formal notice to Rasia and up until then the Parties continued to negotiate, including to settle their dispute.58\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 114-116; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 114-116. *See also* Application, \u00b6 137; Memorial, \u00b6 137; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 89-92.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 117-118; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 117-118; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 93-94; Transcript Day 1, 117: 3-25. *See also* Applicants' Opening Statement, p. 42, indicating that this date is a more appropriate date.\n\n104.\n\nFourth, the Applicants submit that the Tribunal also erred in concluding that the limitations period could be interrupted only by submitting a claim to ICSID arbitration, whereas Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code in fact permits the interruption more broadly.59\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 120, 124-125; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 120, 124-125; Reply, \u00b6 96.\n\n105.\n\nIn the Applicants' view, \"*actions evidencing the acknowledgment of the debt by the person obliged*\", as required under Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code, encompass actions triggering the established dispute resolution mechanisms, such as engaging in a formal process to settle their dispute. In particular, the Applicants contend that the following actions amounted to such \"*actions evidencing the acknowledgment of the debt by the person obliged*\": (i) on December 16, 2015, Rasia served on the Ministry of Transport and Communications of Armenia a formal notice of a dispute under the Road Agreement; (ii) on June 25, 2016, Mr. Borkowski delivered to the Ministry of Transport and Communication and the Prime Minister of Armenia a notification of claim which allegedly commenced the mandatory six-month period of settlement negotiations under the USA-Armenia BIT; and (iii) on April 9, 2017, Rasia served on the Armenian Ministry of Transport and Communication a formal notification of claim under the Road Agreement.60 According to the Applicants, while the Tribunal acknowledged that the Parties had initiated the dispute resolution process, based on the wrong interpretation as described above, it dismissed the Applicants' claims.61\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 121-123, 125; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 121-123, 125; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 97-99, 102.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 124; Memorial, \u00b6 124; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 100-101.\n\n106.\n\nThe Applicants reiterate that, had the Tribunal inquired with the Parties about the interpretation of Article 340 of the Armenian Civil Code, its decision would have been better informed, if not entirely different. They further insist that the Tribunal penalized the Applicants for the Respondent's failure to sufficiently plead its time-bar defence, which warrants annulment of the Award.62\n\nApplication, \u00b6 126; Memorial, \u00b6 126. *See also* Application, \u00b6 55; Memorial, \u00b6 55; Reply, \u00b6 103.\n\n107.\n\nFifth, the Applicants take issue with the Tribunal's finding that their claims were permanently extinguished under Armenian law.63\n\nApplication, \u00b6 127; Memorial, \u00b6 127.\n\n108.\n\nThe Applicants assert that, under Armenian law, untimely claims cannot be substantively extinguished, but rather the conclusion is that the creditor is simply no longer entitled to a remedy without prejudice to the merits of the claim.64\n\nApplication, \u00b6 127; Memorial, \u00b6 127; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 62, 104-105.\n\n109.\n\nFor the Applicants, this erroneous finding by the Tribunal is highly prejudicial to the Applicants as it would forbid them from submitting the same claims in ICC arbitration, despite their right to do so under the Concession Agreements. Particularly, the Applicants contend that the Concession Agreements allow the Applicants to bring the case to ICC arbitration if the Tribunal \"*denies or declines jurisdiction*\" or is \"*otherwise unavailable*\", which is the scenario in this case. However, by determining without either Party ever raising such an argument that the Applicants' claims were permanently extinguished under Armenian law, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its power by purporting to decide for the ICC tribunal that the Applicants' claims no longer exist and attempting to rewrite the dispute settlement mechanism in the Concession Agreements, rather than simply determining not to admit those claims as untimely.65 It is the Applicants' position that this error is compounded by the Tribunal providing only \"*general views*\" on the merits of their contract-based claims, despite having held that it lacked jurisdiction over those claims, which were highly selective and superficial.66\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 127-128; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 127-128; Reply, \u00b6 108. *See also* Application, \u00b6 75(iv); Memorial, \u00b6 75(iv).\n\nApplication, \u00b6 129; Memorial, \u00b6 129; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 118-124, 126. *See also* Application, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 75(vi); Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 75(vi).\n\n110.\n\nSixth, focusing on the Respondent's arguments in the Counter-Memorial, the Applicants submit that: (i) they do not agree with the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code; (ii) they do not agree with the manner and method in which the Tribunal interpreted Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code; (iii) the Respondent merely attempts to paper over the Tribunal's insertion of the word \"*wrongdoing*\" into the Armenian limitations period; (iv) the Respondent seeks to dodge discussions of corruption in this case; (v) the Respondent selectively focuses on limited facts of a series of events which all should be taken into account holistically; (vi) the Respondent endeavors to dismiss the Tribunal's failure to suspend the limitations period as \"*procedurally impermissible and substantively flawed*\"; (vii) the Respondent fails to refute that Mr. Borkowski's claims under the USA-Armenia BIT were impermissibly extinguished; (viii) the Respondent wrongly asserts that the Applicants are seeking an impermissible reweighing of the evidence; and (ix) given the intertwined nature of the Applicants' claims, the Award should be annulled in full.67\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 109-117, 128-129. *See also* Application, \u00b6 59; Memorial, \u00b6 59.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n***(a) Argument 1: The Tribunal erred by importing a procedural prescription period from Armenian law into the ICSID Arbitration***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent first takes issue with the Applicants' alleged mischaracterization of the Award by claiming that the Tribunal treated the limitations defence as a jurisdictional issue, whereas the Award made it clear that it was an issue of admissibility.68 The Respondent adds that contrary to the Applicants' position in this annulment proceeding, they did not plead the limitations defence as a jurisdictional issue during the Arbitration,69 but rather considered the limitations defence as an issue pertaining to the merits.70 The Respondent also states that the Parties agreed during the Arbitration that the limitations period was properly applicable to Rasia's contract claims.71 The Applicants have not referred to any evidence supporting their new position in this annulment proceeding.72 The Respondent thus states that the Applicants' argument in this regard is procedurally barred.73\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 72-75; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4, 55. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 25 and Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 7-25 for other alleged mischaracterizations by the Applicants.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 76-77; Rejoinder, \u00b6 76.\n\nTranscript Day 1, 184:21-24. *See also* Respondent's slides used during its opening presentation at the Hearing (\"**Respondent's Opening Statement**\"), p. 101.\n\nTranscript Day 1, p. 185:19-25. *See also* Respondent's Opening Statement, pp.104-106.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 72.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 78.\n\n112.\n\nCiting an article by Prof. Jan Paulsson, the Respondent contends that an ICSID tribunal's admissibility findings are not subject to annulment by an *ad hoc* committee for excess of power. Relying on the award in *Enron v. Argentina*, Prof. Paulsson's article states that \"*a successful admissibility objection would normally result in rejecting a claim for reasons of the merits*\" and explains that the relevant question in this regard \"*is the objecting party taking aim at the tribunal or at the claim*\".74\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 79. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 73.\n\n113.\n\nFor the Respondent, the issues on the limitations period concern the Applicants' claims and not the Tribunal, because an ICC tribunal, even if the Applicants brought their case before it, would reach the same conclusion as the Tribunal in the present case. This is because the ICC tribunal (i) would have to apply Articles 337-340 of the Armenian Civil Code by virtue of the choice of law provision under the Concession Agreements, and (ii) when applying the *lex arbitri* (the law applicable to arbitration), which is German law in this case that considers limitations period as substantive law, would analyse the substantive law chosen by the Parties (i.e. Armenian Civil Code) to determine whether the Applicants' claims are time-barred. The Respondent thus concludes that, \"*[n]o matter how the tribunal looks at the issue\u2026the result is the same: Applicants lose because their claims are time-barred under the Armenian Civil Code*\".75\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 80-86. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 68.\n\n114.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that the limitations period under Armenian law is substantive law, and not procedural law as claimed by the Applicants.\n\n115.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Applicants' position that \"*the prescription period in the Armenian Civil code is strictly procedural*\". For the Respondent, this assertion is internally inconsistent and untenable as relevant provisions of the Concession Agreements only allow the Armenian Civil Code \"*as a whole*\" to be treated as \"*substantive Legislation*\", but do not permit specific provisions within the Civil Code to be considered as procedural law.76\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 87-95. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 59-65.\n\n116.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent stresses that, as a matter of Armenian law, provisions concerning limitations period are substantive law and not procedural law. The Respondent underscores that it was the Armenian legislator's deliberate decision to include those provisions in the Armenian Civil Code, which is substantive legislation of Armenia, but not in its Civil Procedure Code. For the Respondent, this is further corroborated by the fact that those provisions are part of \"*Division 5*\" of the Armenian Civil Code entitled \"*Transactions. Representations. Time Periods. Limitations of Actions*\" which begins and deals with substantive issues. This is further clarified, in the Respondent's view, by Article 13(1) of the Armenian Civil Code which provides that both courts and arbitral tribunals should apply the Armenian Civil Code so as to protect the civil rights it codified.77 While the Respondent concedes that there is a reference to limitations period in Article 168 of the Armenian Civil Procedure Code, it insists that this provision does not alter the above conclusions as \"*this provision only addresses the motion to apply the statute of limitations and its examination at a preliminary court session and does not address the applicability or substantive issues surrounding the limitations period*\".78 Furthermore, as Article 168 was not part of the Arbitration record, the Respondent avers that it is procedurally impermissible for the Applicants to rely on it in this annulment proceeding.79 Accordingly, there is no excess of power for failure to apply the applicable law in the present case.80\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 96-97; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 58, 66.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 66, 95-96. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 67-69 regarding dispute resolution clause of the USA-Armenia BIT, and \u00b6 95 in which the Respondent notes that Article 168 introduced by the Applicants in the Reply was adopted in April 2018.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 97.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 101. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 61.\n\n117.\n\nThird, the Respondent contends that assuming *arguendo* that the Tribunal made an error, such an error \"*would not in fact be outcome determinative given that the Tribunal made rulings in the alternative that Rasia is not owed any damages for breach as it could not make out causation*\". Therefore, the Respondent contends that any such a possible error by the Tribunal would not have made \"*a difference to the result*\".81\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 102; Rejoinder, \u00b6 81.\n\n***(b) Argument 2: The Tribunal grossly misinterpreted and misapplied the Armenian prescription period***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the Applicants in fact conceded in their pleadings that the Tribunal correctly interpreted Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code82 and that the Tribunal used the right method of interpretation.83 For the Respondent, the Applicants therefore should not be heard to argue that the Tribunal committed an annullable error by failing to apply the applicable law in the first place.84\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 103-105; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 82-86. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 4-7.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 106-109; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 91-93.\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 101, 109.\n\n119.\n\nSecond, the Respondent disagrees with the Applicants' position that the Tribunal misinterpreted and misapplied the Armenian limitations period because such arguments are, in the Respondent's view, predicated on the Applicants' mischaracterization of the Award.85\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 110. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 105-110.\n\n120.\n\nSpecifically, and in the context of the Applicants' claim that the Tribunal substituted the word \"*debt*\" with \"*wrongdoing*\", the Respondent refers to, *inter alia*, paragraphs 459-464 and 466 of the Award and states that \"*the Tribunal never so substituted any words in the Civil Code as is clear on the face of the Award*\". According to the Respondent, the Tribunal noted that the acknowledgement of a breach or other wrongdoing was \"*sufficient*\" to toll the statute of limitations in application, but it did not hold that such an acknowledgement of breach or wrongdoing was \"*necessary*\" for limitations period to be interrupted. The Respondent thus insists that the Tribunal assessed whether there was an acknowledgement of an obligation \"*which is either intended to, or would have the natural effect of, encouraging a counterparty to refrain from initiating legal action*\", rather than mechanically requiring the existence of an acknowledgement by a party of a \"*wrongdoing*\".86 The Respondent adds that the word \"*wrongdoing*\" only appears three times in the Award, none of which concern the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code.87\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 110-122. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 31, 98-101.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 87-89.\n\n121.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent states that the acknowledgement must concern the obligation at issue in the potential lawsuit. For example, not every breach of a contract in a long-term project, and the breaching party's confirmation that the contract is still alive, could lead to interruption of limitations period. Thus, for the Respondent, a statute of limitations is not interrupted when in a long-term contract one party (i) merely \"*acknowledges*\" to the other that the contract is still in force/not terminated; or (ii) simply lodges a concern with a counter-party.88 According to the Respondent, the Tribunal did assess evidence as put forward by the Applicants and noted that \"*if taken in isolation*\" some of the Respondent's statements in 2016 could be viewed as acknowledgments, but dismissed their claims as \"*[t]he insurmountable problem for the Claimants is that it is abundantly clear they did not rely on the Respondent's statements in any way*\".89\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 102-104.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 123-128.\n\n122.\n\nThird, the Respondent rejects the Applicants' assertion that the Tribunal should have applied the 10-year limitations period in this case, *inter alia*, for the following reasons: (i) as the Applicants concede, they never raised this issue during the Arbitration; (ii) the issue of corruption was not germane to the Award; (iii) the Tribunal made no finding of a solicited bribe in its Award; (iv) the Applicants failed to submit evidence in support of their position in this respect; (v) the error, if admitted, at most only rises to the level of an error *in judicando*, and does not constitute a failure to apply the applicable law; (vi) the requirements under the applicable provisions are not met in this case; and (vii) Procedural Orders No. 4 and No. 7 were rendered reasonably and thus they do not amount to unequal treatment of the Parties.90\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 129-136; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12, 112-119.\n\n123.\n\nFourth, with regard to the Applicants' contention that the Tribunal erred in determining that the limitations period commenced on March 18, 2015, the Respondent submits, in essence, that the Applicants (i) fail to show how the alleged mistake amounts to a \"*manifest excess of power*\" by the Tribunal; (ii) do not submit any argument or interpretation of the statute as to why such date is not relevant; and (iii) stated in the Arbitration that March 18, 2015 was \"*the date on which the Claimants were substantially and irreversibly deprived of their investments*\" and thus any possible subsequent breaches by the Respondent are irrelevant.91\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 137-140, 166-170. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 120-126.\n\n124.\n\nFifth, addressing the Applicants' complaint that the Tribunal misjudged by interpreting that the limitations period could only be interrupted by submitting a claim to ICSID arbitration, the Respondent argues that the Applicants' position is impermissible and substantively flawed because the Applicants (i) merely state that the Tribunal \"*grossly erred in interpreting and applying the limitations period*\", whereas errors in interpretation and application are not grounds for annulment; (ii) had already advanced the same argument before the Tribunal which was dismissed; (iii) provide no legal authority to substantiate their position and therefore their argument remains as a mere difference of opinion; and (iv) misrepresent when they say that the Tribunal ignored the Applicants' notifications under the USA-Armenia BIT and the Road Concession allegedly evidencing the Parties' settlement negotiations.92 Referring to the Japan-Armenia BIT as an example, the Respondent further states that neither the commencement of amicable resolution nor the filing of a notice of intent satisfies or interrupts the limitations period in this case.93\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 141-148. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 127, 131.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 128-133.\n\n125.\n\nSixth, the Respondent takes issue with the Applicants' alleged misrepresentation of the Award that Rasia's claims were extinguished.\n\n126.\n\nThe Respondent points out that paragraph 471 of the Award, which the Applicants rely upon in support of their argument on this issue, in fact does not concern Rasia's claims, but rather it concerns Mr. Borkowski's umbrella clause claim. The Respondent asserts that the language of the paragraph, \"*does not opine on whether the time bar extinguishes claims under Armenian law*\", but rather it \"*simply provides further illustrations for its reasoning that an unassertable contract right cannot be vindicated through an umbrella clause claim*\".94\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 149-151. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 137, 139.\n\n127.\n\nConcerning the Applicants' contention that an alleged extinguishment of their claims is an excess of powers because it supposedly encroaches on the powers of the ICC tribunal, the Respondent claims that the Applicants conflate jurisdictional with admissibility rulings.95\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 136.\n\n128.\n\nSeventh, the Respondent avers that the Applicants exclusively focus on the requirement of an \"*excess of power*\" in their submissions but plead nothing on the requirement that such an excess of power must be \"*manifest*\".96\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 98.\n\n129.\n\nEighth, the Respondent adds that the Applicants' arguments under these annulment grounds only pertain to Rasia's claims, but not Mr. Borkowski's BIT claims or the Tribunal's determination on causation and damages. Therefore, even if successful, it can only result in a partial annulment of the Award.97\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 182-183, 185. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 147-152.\n\n130.\n\nNinth, the Respondent advances that any new arguments raised by the Applicants in this annulment proceeding with regard to Armenian law should be dismissed as they do not form part of the underlying Arbitration record. It also reiterates and provides the following observations in response to the Applicants' such alleged new arguments: (i) the statute of limitations is substantive law of Armenia because, *inter alia*, it is provided in the Armenian Civil Code; (ii) the expiration of the limitations period does not affect the right to bring the claim, but if the opposing party makes a request in conformity with Article 335 of the Armenian Civil Code, the court can apply the statute of limitations and render a judgment dismissing the claim/recognizing it as inadmissible if the prescribed time limit has lapsed, which is what happened in this case; (iii) the limitations period is a matter of admissibility and merits, rather than a procedural or jurisdictional matter, pursuant to Article 335(1) of the Armenian Civil Code as well as scholars and jurisprudence in Armenia;98 and (iv) the Applicants' attempt to overturn the Tribunal's evidential findings, without providing any evidence to the contrary, should not be accepted.99\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 186-191.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Committee notes at the outset that it is not its mission to verify whether the Tribunal applied the law correctly. The Committee subscribes to the view expressed by the *Amco Asia* committee that an annulment committee's task consists in \"*determining whether the Tribunal did in fact apply the law it was bound to apply to the dispute. Failure to apply such law, as distinguished from mere misconstruction of that law, would constitute a manifest excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal and a ground for nullity under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention*\".100\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1 (Annulment Proceeding), *Ad Hoc* Committee Decision on the Application for Annulment (May 16, 1986), \u00b6 23, AL-0022-ENG.\n\n132.\n\nGiven the Committee's belief in the limited role of annulment committees in the ICSID system, which clearly distinguishes them from appellate bodies, it will refrain from engaging in a new examination of the legal and factual issues at stake in the Arbitration.\n\n133.\n\nWith this preface in mind, the Committee will turn to the analysis of the two arguments advanced by the Applicants under this ground of annulment.\n\n***(a) Argument 1: The Tribunal erred by importing a procedural prescription period from Armenian law into the ICSID Arbitration***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe Applicants submit that the Tribunal erred in applying the statute of limitations under the Armenian Civil Code because this was a strictly procedural question under Armenian law and the Parties to the Concession Agreements only agreed to apply Armenia's \"'*substantive legislation', indicating that they intended to carve out* procedural *rules from their choice of law*\".101 Moreover, for the Applicants, \"*prescription is a jurisdictional defense and the Tribunal's jurisdiction is governed by international law only*\".102 Their conclusion is that the Tribunal applied the wrong rules of law and failed to exercise its jurisdiction thus committing a manifest excess of powers.103\n\nReply, \u00b6 49, emphasis in the original.\n\nReply, \u00b6 47.\n\nReply, \u00b6 51.\n\n135.\n\nIn reviewing this first argument, the Committee notes that in the Arbitration the Claimants/Applicants did not advance the arguments they make in these proceedings, i.e. they did not argue in the Arbitration that the words \"*substantive Legislation*\" do not include procedural law or that the statute of limitations is a strictly procedural matter under Armenian law. Moreover, the Claimants/Applicants did not plead in the Arbitration the question of the statute of limitations as pertaining to jurisdiction, but, rather, in the sections of their written submissions dealing with the merits.104\n\nArbitration Reply, Section VII D 1, RA-0007-ENG; Claimants' First Arbitration Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 307, RA-0029-ENG.\n\n136.\n\nMore specifically, in the Arbitration, the Claimants/Applicants argued that the statute of limitations was interrupted by certain actions of the Claimants/Applicants but they did not dispute that the applicable limitations period for their contract claims under Armenian law is three years, that their alleged \"*valuation date*\" is March 18, 2015, and that the Arbitration was commenced on July 19, 2018, more than three years later.105 In addition, the Claimants/Applicants submitted that, with regard to Mr. Borkowski's claims under the umbrella clause of the Treaty, the consequences of Armenia's Concession breaches are governed by customary international law, and not Armenian law, because, by breaching the Concessions, Armenia also violated its public international law obligation under the Treaty to comply with obligations it entered into under the Concessions.106\n\nArbitration Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 601-605, RA-0007-ENG.\n\nArbitration Reply, \u00b6 606, RA-0007-ENG.\n\n137.\n\nAs to the meaning that must be attributed to the words \"*substantive Legislation*\" in the Concession Agreements, there appears to have been no discussion in the Arbitration whether or not this terminology includes procedural law, and there is none in the Award. Instead, the Tribunal's analysis of the Respondent's statute of limitations defense with regard to Rasia's claims for breach of the Concessions Agreements begins by stating that \"*the Parties agree [that these claims] are governed by Armenian law*\".107 The Tribunal added: \"*the Parties also agree that the applicable provisions of the Armenian Civil Code are*\" Articles 332, 337 and 340 and proceeded to conduct an interpretation of these provisions of the Code of Civil Law.108 The fact that the Parties agreed on the application of these provisions of the Armenian Civil Code was confirmed at the Hearing by the Respondent and is not disputed by the Applicants.109\n\nAward, \u00b6 445, A-0001-ENG.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 445-446, A-0001-ENG.\n\nTranscript Day 2, pp. 298-300.\n\n138.\n\nWithin this context, the Tribunal correctly analysed the question in the light of the provisions of Armenian law which the Parties agreed were applicable, i.e. Articles 332, 337 and 340, and interpreted those provisions \"*based on the apparent ordinary meaning of the terms used*\".110\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 445-446, A-0001-ENG.\n\n139.\n\nArticle XVIII (67) of the Concession Agreements does indeed refer to \"*the substantive Legislation of the Republic of Armenia*\" as the governing law of the contracts.111 The term \"*Legislation*\" is defined in Article I, Section 1, of the Agreements as \"*any and all enactments, statutes, codes, laws, international treaties, regulations, decrees, decisions, administrative interpretations, ordinances, by-laws, directives, guidelines, rules, or policies of any State Authority*\", in other words as encompassing the entirety of Armenia's laws.112\n\nRailway Agreement, A-0002-ENG; Road Agreement, A-0003-ENG.\n\nRailway Agreement, A-0002-ENG; Road Agreement, A-0003-ENG.\n\n140.\n\nThe Committee cannot share the Applicants' artificial distinction between provisions of Armenian law applying to the merits of the dispute and provisions applying to jurisdiction. The Committee fails to see any basis for the Applicants' contention that the Parties' designation of \"*substantive*\" legislation in the governing law provisions of the Concession Agreements indicates that they \"*intended to carve out* procedural *rules from their choice of law*\".113 In the Committee's opinion, no such carve out is apparent from a plain reading of the governing law clause of the Concession Agreements and the Tribunal correctly applied the Civil Code of Armenia as part and parcel of \"*the substantive Legislation of the Republic of Armenia*\", i.e. the laws of Armenia seen as a whole. This was the correct approach both in light of the Parties' agreement that Armenian law governed the Concession Agreements and the language of Article XVIII (67) recalled above. The Tribunal applied the applicable law and therefore a manifest excess of powers cannot be found. By the same token, since the Tribunal did not apply the wrong law, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers by failing to exercise its jurisdiction and the Applicants' argument in this regard is accordingly also dismissed.\n\nReply, \u00b6 49.\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondent contends that annulment would be improper in this case because the Tribunal treated the limitations issue as an issue of admissibility rather than jurisdiction,114 and that the Tribunal's ruling \"*also could be characterized as a merits determination*\".115 The Respondent in particular argues that a merits determination is not subject to review by an *ad hoc* committee as a manifest excess of power except if the tribunal failed to apply the proper law.116 The Applicants, for their part, contend that the distinction between jurisdiction and merits is irrelevant to the Committee's determination of whether an excess of power by the Tribunal existed in this case.117\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 73.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 74.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 81.\n\nTranscript Day 1, pp. 111-114.\n\n142.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal did not qualify its analysis as belonging to either the realm of jurisdiction or admissibility. Even though the question of whether the claims under the Concession Agreements and the umbrella clause claims are time-barred falls under the general heading of \"*Jurisdiction and Admissibility*\" of the Award, the review and analysis of this question is separate from the preceding section entitled \"*Are the Claims Admissible?*\", thus suggesting that the question is not one of admissibility. The Committee is inclined to agree with the Respondent that the Tribunal's ruling is \"*a ruling on the basis of the law 'applicable to these Agreements*'\" without further qualification.118 Put it another way, as noted by the Respondent's counsel at the Hearing, \"*[t]he claim is time-barred as a matter of the applicable law*\".119\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 74.\n\nTranscript Day 1, 183: 9-10.\n\n143.\n\nIn any event, the Committee agrees with the Applicants that the nature of the Tribunal's ruling in this regard is ultimately irrelevant for purposes of this ground of annulment. What matters in the Committee's opinion is that the Tribunal applied the proper law to this issue, both because it was the governing law of the Concessions Agreements and because it had been so argued in the cases put forward by the Parties, which thus established the proper legal framework within which the Tribunal's decision fell. In this regard, it is important to stress that the Applicants' argument that provisions concerning limitations periods are inapplicable in this case because they are procedural in nature in the light also of Article 168 of the Armenian Civil Procedure Code was not before the Tribunal and can therefore not be entertained by this Committee. As held by the *ad hoc* committee in *Kl\u00f6ckner I*, the ICSID annulment process cannot \"*be used by one party to complete or develop an argument which it could and should have made during the arbitral proceeding or help that party retrospectively to fill gaps in its arguments*\".120\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision on the Application for Annulment Submitted by Kl\u00f6ckner (May 3, 1985) (\"***Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon***\"*)*, \u00b6 83, AL-0012-ENG.\n\n144.\n\nWith regard to the Applicants' allegation that, in holding that their claims were \"*extinguished*\", the Tribunal \"*re-wrote the Parties' Concessions and robbed the Claimants of any opportunity for redress*\" in a possible future ICC arbitration,121 the Committee considers that the Applicants seem to read too much into the Award. The word \"*extinguishment*\" appears once in the Award, at paragraph 471, and it is used in the context of the discussion of Mr. Borkowski's umbrella clause claims. The statement in question reads as follows: \"*[u]mbrella clauses may provide a path to an international dispute resolution forum, constituted under treaty, but they do not transform the nature of the underlying contractual rights and obligations; those underlying rights and obligations are still capable of extinguishment in accordance with the laws under which they initially were established*\". Thus, the Tribunal did not declare the claims \"*extinguished*\" under Armenian law, it simply noticed \u2013 in the particular context of claims asserted under an umbrella clause \u2013 that these claims are capable of extinguishment because their contractual nature is not transformed by virtue of the umbrella clause. The Committee therefore is at a loss understanding how in the circumstances the Applicants could have been \"*robbed of an opportunity for redress*\" by the Tribunal. The Committee notes that the Applicants advance similar allegations that their claims were \"*extinguished*\" also with regard to its second argument under this ground of annulment, i.e. that the Tribunal misinterpreted and misapplied the Armenian prescription period. Given that the Committee has addressed these allegations in this section, and that the same reasoning applies also to the Applicants' second argument, they will not be addressed again in the Section that follows to avoid unnecessary repetition.\n\nReply, \u00b6 54.\n\n145.\n\nHaving established that there was no excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal as both the Applicants' arguments that the Tribunal (i) applied the wrong rules of law and (ii) failed to exercise its jurisdiction have been dismissed, the question of the \"*manifestness*\" of the excess of power is moot and needs not to be examined.\n\n***(b) Argument 2: The Tribunal grossly misinterpreted and misapplied the Armenian prescription period***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Applicants also contend that the Tribunal committed an excess of power because it misinterpreted and misapplied the Armenian statute of limitation period. They argue in particular that the Tribunal did not interpret the statute on the basis of the literal meaning of its words but instead assigned \"*its own idiosyncratic definitions to key phrases*\".122\n\nReply, \u00b6 111.\n\n147.\n\nThe Committee considers that, to the extent that the Applicants argue that the Tribunal provided the wrong interpretation of Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code, this is not a matter that may be subject to annulment. The appreciation and assessment of the evidence and the interpretation of the law are clearly matters that fell within the Tribunal competence and cannot be re-visited by this Committee, lest it acts like a court of appeal, which is not its role. In this regard, the Committee endorses the following position expressed by the committee in *Alapli v. Turkey*:\n\n*\"[P]ursuant to Arbitration Rule 34(1), the tribunal is the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value. Not only is such an analysis not warranted by the language of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, but also the tribunal, having first-hand knowledge of the evidence before it, is best situated to interpret it. What is more, a tribunal has considerable discretion in its evaluation of the evidence.\"*123\n\n*Alapli v. Turkey*, \u00b6 234, RLA-0019-ENG.\n\n148.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Applicants, while acknowledging that the date picked by the Tribunal as the start of the limitation period (March 18, 2015) was \"*an important date*\", argued that \"*a more appropriate date*\" for the start of the prescription period is July 27, 2017, when Armenia indicated that Rasia \"*[wa]s free to file a claim against the government [with] ICSID*\".124 For the Applicants, the Tribunal's \"*decision reflects hindsight bias*\" and the fact that the Tribunal chose an arbitrary date to start the limitation period was \"*a very serious sign of unfairness and bias*\".125\n\nTranscript Day 1, 114:24-115:4, 117:3-15.\n\nTranscript Day 1, 116:25-117:2, 118:4-14; Applicants' Opening Statement, pp. 41-42.\n\n149.\n\nThe Committee considers that the Applicants' argument has no merit as there is no basis to assert that the Tribunal's decision reflected bias. The alternative date now put forward by the Applicants in these proceedings had not been advanced by the Claimants/Applicants as the appropriate date for the commencement of the limitations period before the Tribunal. As recalled in the Award, the Respondent contended in the Arbitration that the limitations period began to run on March 18, 2015, which is the date by which Armenia had repudiated the Concession Agreements, and the date Claimants/Applicants selected as the \"*valuation date*\" for their damages claim.126 While in the Arbitration the Claimants/Applicants submitted that Armenia's allegedly wrongful acts did not stop before July 19, 2015127 and continued as late as 2017,128 they did not expressly contend that any specific date should be used as the starting date of the limitations period nor did they propose an alternative to the Respondent's date of March 18, 2015.\n\nAward, \u00b6 433, A-0001-ENG.\n\nArbitration Reply, \u00b6 607, A-0024\\_ENG. *See also* Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 113-119.\n\nArbitration Reply, \u00b6 607, A-0024-ENG.\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis in the Award of when the three-year statute of limitations began running logically starts from the language of Article 337(1) which provides that that time-period begins to run \"*when [Rasia] learn[ed] or should have learned of the violation of [its] right*\".129 In applying this provision to the facts of the case, the Tribunal observed that the Claimants' argued that \"*their investments 'were destroyed by Armenia through a series of acts beginnings in November 2012' and that '[t]here is no single event which constituted the total loss of the Claimants' investments*'\". The Tribunal then considered that the accrual date for purposes of the statute of limitations analysis was the valuation date selected by the Claimants/Applicants, i.e. March 18, 2015, which was described by the Claimants/Applicants as \"*the date by which Armenia* had made clear its intention *to eliminate the Railway Project as well as the Road Project*\".130\n\nAward, \u00b6 447, A-0001-ENG.\n\nAward, \u00b6 448, A-0001-ENG, emphasis in the original.\n\n151.\n\nThus, on the basis of the arguments and evidence before it, the Tribunal's conclusion was that \"*the Claimants' pleading that Armenia took additional steps in breach of the Concessions after Claimants already had been 'irreversibly deprived of their investments' in March 2015 did not alter the accrual date for purposes of the statute of limitations analysis*\".131 It follows that the date chosen by the Tribunal was not an arbitrary date, but one that was selected after consideration of the relevant provision of Armenian law applied in the light of the arguments made by the Parties in the case. While the Claimants/Applicants disagree with the Tribunal's choice of date, which also happens to be the date that was chosen by the Respondent in the Arbitration, the Committee can detect nothing inappropriate, let alone arbitrary, in the way the Tribunal decided this question. In any event, even assuming, *quod non*, that the Tribunal had alternative dates before it, whether or not the Tribunal chose the most appropriate date is not for this Committee to decide.\n\nAward, \u00b6 449, A-0001-ENG.\n\n152.\n\nThe Applicants also allege that their claims in the Arbitration were based on the corrupt actions of the Armenian Ministry of Transport, Mr. Beglaryan, and this should have had an impact on the limitations period by virtue of Article 333(1) of the Civil Code which provides that, when an injury is alleged to have resulted from corrupt actions, there is a 10-year limitations period starting from the time of the corrupt actions.132 For the Applicants, the Tribunal erred by ignoring these corruption allegations and did not treat the Parties equally because it denied the Claimants/Applicants' request to compel Mr. Beglaryan's testimony and instead accepted the Respondent's request to compel the testimony of Mr. Weixin from CCCC, a member of the Claimants/Applicants' consortium.133\n\nApplication, \u00b6 105.; Reply, \u00b6 85.\n\nReply, \u00b6 86.\n\n153.\n\nThe Committee has the following observations to make in this regard. First, to the extent that the issue of corruption was pleaded in the Arbitration, the Tribunal did deal with it and rejected it as follows: \"*Given the demanding standard for proving corruption and illegality, as well as Mr. Borkowski's observed penchant for exaggerating evidence to try to advance his case [\u2026], the Tribunal declines to accept the alleged bribery request as proven, based solely on Mr. Borkowski's uncorroborated testimony that it occurred*.\"134 It is not the function of the Committee to revisit the Tribunal's appreciation of the probative value of the evidence and substitute its views to those of the Tribunal.\n\nAward, \u00b6 496, A-0001-ENG.\n\n154.\n\nSecond, as to the longer limitations period under Article 333(1) of the Armenian Civil Code, this point was never before the Tribunal as none of the Parties raised it in the Arbitration. The Applicants argue that the Respondent should have brought it to the Tribunal's attention, but, arguably, this was a potential defense that should have been raised by the Claimants/Applicants against the Respondent's argument that the claims were barred by a three-year statute of limitations. Yet, the Claimants/Applicants failed to make that argument then and they are barred from making that argument now. A ground for annulment cannot be upheld on the basis of arguments that were not advanced in the original arbitration.\n\n155.\n\nThird, the Committee finds no unequal treatment of the Parties in the fact that a request to hear witness testimony by the Claimants/Applicants was denied by the Tribunal. Once more, this is the kind of appreciation of the evidence that fell within the Tribunal's discretion and the Committee cannot re-visit it. Moreover, in the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal noted in the Award that it \"*was unable to hear testimony from Minister Beglaryan, who is no longer under the Respondent's direction and control*\".135 Thus, it appears that, in its discretion and in the light of the evidence before it, the Tribunal made the decision not to call Mr. Beglaryan as a witness. It is true that the Tribunal requested the Claimants/Applicants to file a witness statement by Mr. Weixin and to make him available for cross-examination.136 However, the Award shows that this was done in order to test the authenticity of certain documents introduced by the Claimants/Applicants and therefore, not only this was a very different situation from Mr. Beglaryan's, but the witness statement had been requested by the Tribunal in order to allow the Claimants/Applicants to introduce certain documentary evidence and thus this was to their benefit, rather than their detriment.137 In the circumstances, no unequal treatment of the Parties can be found.\n\nAward, \u00b6 649, A-0001-ENG.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 66, 69-70, A-0001-ENG.\n\nTranscript Day 2, 288:10-25; 288:22-289:4.\n\n156.\n\nThe Applicants further allege that the Tribunal grossly misinterpreted and misapplied Armenian law by: (i) adding a new requirement of \"*wrongdoing*\" which does not exist under Armenian law, and (ii) concluding that the statute of limitations could only be interrupted by submitting a claim to ICSID arbitration whereas Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code permits the interruption more broadly.\n\n157.\n\nWith regard to the Applicants' allegation that the Tribunal replaced the word \"*debt*\" with the word \"*wrongdoing*\" in interpreting Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code, the Committee considers that the Applicants misrepresent the Tribunal's analysis and finds it useful to recap how the matter was treated in the Award. It should be noted that, with regard to this point, similar arguments are also made in support of the ground of annulment for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure which will be considered under Section B(2)c below.\n\n158.\n\nTo put the question in context, the Tribunal examined the Respondent's argument that the Claimants' claims under the Concession Agreements were barred under Armenian law in Section D of the Award entitled \"*Are the Claims Under the Concessions and the Umbrella Clause Barred?*\".138\n\nAward, pp. 142 *et seq*., A-0001-ENG.\n\n159.\n\nAs discussed above, the Respondent argued that the limitations period began to run on March 18, 2015, which is the date by which Claimants contended Armenia had repudiated the Concession Agreements, and the date Claimants selected as the \"*valuation date*\" for their damages claim. Accordingly, the Respondent argued, the limitations period expired on March 18, 2018. Given that the Claimants commenced the Arbitration on July 19, 2018, more than three years after the date of March 18, 2015, any claim under the Concession Agreements was time-barred.139\n\nAward, \u00b6 433, A-0001-ENG.\n\n160.\n\nAs recalled by the Tribunal at the start of its analysis in the Award, the Respondent's statute of limitations defense sought to defeat Rasia's claims for breach of the Concession Agreements and Mr. Borkowski's umbrella clause claim under the BIT. Given that the defense was not asserted with regard to Mr. Borkowski's other claims under the BIT, those claims would have proceeded regardless of the Tribunal's findings on the statute of limitations and the umbrella clause claims.140\n\nAward, \u00b6 444, A-0001-ENG.\n\n161.\n\nThe Tribunal began by dealing with the contractual claims and recalled the applicable provisions of the Armenian Civil Code, Articles 332, 337 and 340.141 This latter provision reads as follows:\n\n***Article 340. Interruption of the running of the term for the statute of limitations***\n\n*1. Running of the statute of limitations shall be interrupted by the filing of a claim in the prescribed manner, as well as by performing actions evidencing the acknowledgement of the debt by the person obliged.*\n\n*2. Running of the term for the statute of limitations shall restart after the interruption. The time which has elapsed before the interruption shall not be calculated within the new term.*\n\nAward, \u00b6 445, A-0001-ENG.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal examined first the question of the starting date of the three-year statute of limitations and then proceeded to consider whether the running of the three-year period was \"*interrupted*\" pursuant to Article 340(1). The Tribunal first observed that the Parties had not submitted any legal authorities to assist in the interpretation of this provision, which is an undisputed fact, and moved to consider \"*the likely purpose of this provision along with its literal text\"*.142 The Tribunal then went on to state that in this case the terms of Article 340(1) should be interpreted more broadly than the literal meaning of the words \"*acknowledgement of a debt\"* and should \"*include an acknowledgment of an outstanding contractual obligation to another, which is either intended to, or would have the natural effect of, encouraging a counterparty to refrain from initiating legal action\".*143\n\nAward, \u00b6 456, A-0001-ENG. *See* Transcript Day 1, 51:10-25, 104:18-24, 105:6-106:2.\n\nAward, \u00b6 457, A-0001-ENG.\n\n163.\n\nThe Applicants take no issue with the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 340(1) and find it essentially correct and corresponding to what they consider to be the literal or ordinary meaning of the statute.144 However, in the Applicants' view, the Tribunal departed from this interpretation later on in the Award and committed critical errors by *\"effectively inventing new legal rules\"* which were outcome determinative in this case145 when it examined whether the limitations period was interrupted by any actions taken by Armenia \"*evidencing the acknowledgement of the debt*\"*.* It is thus necessary to review the entirety of the Tribunal's analysis to determine whether the Applicants' understanding is correct.\n\nTranscript Day 1, 42:6-19.\n\nTranscript Day 1, 43:8-9.\n\n164.\n\nHaving provided its interpretation of Article 340(1) in paragraph 457 of the Award, the Tribunal went on to recall that, according to the Claimants/Applicants, the statute of limitations had been interrupted by statements made by the Respondent on three occasions after March 18, 2015 (on February 15, 2016, March 18, 2016, and July 3, 2017).146 It should be noted in this regard that, during the Hearing in these proceedings, the Applicants stated that there were four such occasions and also mentioned an email dated April 5, 2016, a document which they attempted to introduce into the evidence on the eve of the Hearing and whose production was not allowed by the Committee.147 While this document was not examined by the Tribunal together with the three others mentioned above, the Award refers to it at paragraph 461 as one of the instances in early 2016 which, in the Tribunal's opinion, \"*could be viewed as encouraging the Claimants to engage in practical discussions to revive at least the Railway Project, rather than declaring an end to the Parties' dealings*\".148 Thus, it appears that the Tribunal did consider this document and viewed it as a separate occasion which might have interrupted the statute of limitations but did not, according to the Tribunal's conclusion. Whatever the reasons for considering this document separately from the other occasions, the fact remains that the Tribunal did take it into account in its analysis.\n\nAward, \u00b6 458, A-0001-ENG.\n\nApplicants' Opening Statement, p. 13. *See also* Transcript Day 1, 7:24-26:3.\n\nAward, \u00b6 461, A-0001-ENG. The relevant passage reads as follows: \"*on 5 April 2016, the Respondent asked Rasia to provide a 'sample time-line on the completion of the next steps and the obligations of the [Railway Concession]'*\". Reference is made in fn 673 to Exhibit C-176, Email from Mr. G. Grigoryan to Mr. J. Borkowski, 5 April 2016.\n\n165.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Applicants reviewed again this documentary evidence and argued that it showed that Armenia repeatedly acknowledged its existing contractual obligations and ensured that it would cooperate to revive the railway projects.149 In the Applicants' opinion, \"*these are precisely the sort of communications that (\u2026) would have the natural effect of encouraging a counterparty from initiating legal action*\".150 and would therefore satisfy the Tribunal's literal interpretation of Article 340(1) at paragraph 457 of the Award. Instead, the Applicants argue, there was a \"*complete disconnect*\" between the Tribunal's interpretation and the rule that it applied in the Award in analysing the various documents.151 For the Applicants, the Tribunal was not applying Article 340(1) and rejected the evidence on the basis of the new requirements of \"*acknowledgement of wrongdoing*\" or \"*a call for the parties to revive the projects*\" that appear nowhere in the statute.152\n\nTranscript Day 1, pp. 57-69.\n\nTranscript Day 1, 70:14-18.\n\nTranscript Day 1, 73:23-74:4.\n\nTranscript Day 1, pp. 77-82.\n\n166.\n\nThe Committee disagrees. In the Committee's opinion, when the reasoning of the Tribunal is examined as a whole in its proper context, it is clear that the Tribunal had no intention of substituting the words of the statute or creating new legal requirements. The Tribunal was simply reviewing and assessing the documentary evidence submitted by the Claimants/Applicants to decide whether it was capable of interrupting the limitations period set forth in Article 430(1). In particular, the Tribunal noted that several points emerged from an examination of the occasions that were said to have interrupted the statute of limitations. The relevant paragraphs of the Award (459-461) read as follows:\n\n*459. First, none of the Respondent's statements on these occasions can be said to include any acknowledgment of wrongdoing on Armenia's part; to the contrary, they consistently defend Armenia's conduct, deny any breach on its part, and contend that Rasia was the party responsible for the failure of either Project to proceed.*\n\n*460. Second, and notwithstanding the Respondent's complaints about Rasia's performance, the Respondent consistently maintained on these occasions that the Concessions had not been terminated, but they remained in effect.*\n\n*461. Third, if taken in isolation, several of the Respondent's statements in early 2016 could be viewed as encouraging the Claimants to engage in practical discussions to revive at least the Railway Project, rather than declaring an end to the Parties' dealings.*\n\n167.\n\nSo, it was in the context of reviewing the post-March 18, 2015 documents mentioned above that the Tribunal observed for the first time at paragraph 459 of the Award, that \"*none of the Respondent's statements on these occasions can be said to include* any acknowledgment of wrongdoing *on Armenia's part\".*153 However, the Tribunal's reasoning does not end here as this paragraph goes on to say that Armenia's statements on the occasions examined \"*consistently defend Armenia's conduct, deny any breach on its part, and contend that Rasia was the party responsible for the failure of either Project to proceed*\". Moreover, the Tribunal concluded that \"*the Respondent consistently maintained on these occasions that the Concessions had not been terminated, but they remained in effect*\" and that many statements by Armenia \"*could be viewed as encouraging the Claimants to engage in practical discussions to revive at least the Railway Project, rather than declaring an end to the Parties' dealings\"*. Significantly, the Tribunal also stated that \"*statements acknowledging both Parties' ongoing contractual obligations to one another and professing a willingness to move forward could be seen as fulfilling the implicit broader purposes of the 'interruption' provision, namely, to stop a limitations period from running while one party continues to encourage and promise mutual performance rather than a resort to litigation*\". However, the Tribunal continued, \"*[t]he insurmountable problem for the Claimants is that it is abundantly clear they did not rely on the Respondent's statements in any way*\". These conclusions are formulated in a clear and logical way and show that what mattered to the Tribunal in assessing this evidence was that \u2013 while Armenia did not admit that it had a debt vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants/Applicants and maintained that the Concessions had not been terminated \u2013 the Claimants/Applicants pushed forward with litigation.154\n\nAward, \u00b6 459, A-0001-ENG, emphasis added.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 463-465, A-0001-ENG, emphasis added.\n\n168.\n\nAt paragraph 466 of the Award, the Tribunal repeated for the second and last time the word \"*wrongdoing*\" in considering a statement made by the Armenian Minister of Justice at a July 3, 2017 meeting which was said by the Claimants/Applicants to have interrupted the statute of limitations, and found that the statement fell \"*far short of satisfying the requirements for interrupting the limitations period, when it was not accompanied either by any acknowledgment of the Respondent's wrongdoing or by any call for the Parties to revive the Projects*\".155 The Applicants understand this paragraph as introducing two new legal requirements that did not exist in the statute. However, in the Committee's view, the Tribunal was simply elaborating from its initial interpretation of Article 340(1) and providing two examples rather than inventing new statutory requirements. The words \"*acknowledgement of the Respondent's wrongdoing*\" in particular appears to have been used as an alternative to the term \"*acknowledgement of the debt*\" used in Article 340(1). This is further confirmed by the fact that, if one were to substitute the word *wrongdoing* with the word *debt* in the paragraphs of the Award where the former is mentioned, the logical sequence of the Tribunal's analysis and the outcome reached would be exactly the same.\n\nAward, \u00b6 466, A-0001-ENG, emphasis added.\n\n169.\n\nThe Committee also does not accept the Applicants' argument that the Tribunal exceeded its powers because it grossly misinterpreted and misapplied Article 340(1) the Armenian Civil Code by concluding that the statute of limitations was interrupted only by submitting the ICSID claim. In the Committee's opinion, the Tribunal did apply the law that should have been applied to the question. While the Applicants take issue with the manner in which the Tribunal interpreted and applied this provision, and argued that the Tribunal misconstrued it, the Tribunal's analysis was not so gross or egregious to amount to a failure to apply the proper law.\n\n170.\n\nIn the light of the above, the Committee finds that the Tribunal applied the law that it was bound to apply to the dispute as it was argued by the Parties in the Arbitration and it did so thoroughly and logically. As will be seen at paragraphs 209-234 below, the Tribunal also committed no violation of due process. It follows that the Tribunal committed no excess of powers.\n\n171.\n\nGiven the Committee's conclusions, there is no need to examine whether any excess of powers was \"*manifest*\". The question raised by the Respondent that only partial annulment is permissible in this case is also moot given that the Committee has rejected this ground of annulment.\n\n**B. Ground 2: Serious Departure from A Fundamental Rule of Procedure (Article 52(1)(D))**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Applicable Legal Standard of Review for Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure (Article 52(1)(d))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Applicants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nThe Applicants submit that this ground for annulment, which is designed to safeguard the fundamental integrity of the arbitral process, is triggered if the following two requirements are met: (i) the rule concerned is fundamental; and (ii) the departure from the rule is serious.156\n\nApplication, \u00b6 61; Memorial, \u00b6 61. *See also* Reply, \u00b6 30.\n\n173.\n\nRegarding the first requirement on the \"*fundamentality*\" of the rule, the Applicants assert that this concerns mandatory rules of natural justice and principles of judicial fairness, and it is not limited to violations of specific provisions of the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules. The Applicants list examples of fundamental rules of procedure identified by *ad hoc* committees, including: (i) the right to be heard; (ii) equal treatment of the parties; (iii) the principle of party autonomy; and (iv) the treatment of evidence and burden of proof.157 The Applicants explain that the right to be heard encompasses both matters of fact and law.158\n\nApplication, \u00b6 62; Memorial, \u00b6 62; Reply, \u00b6 27(i).\n\nReply, \u00b6 32.\n\n174.\n\nThe Applicants contend that the right to be heard is a fundamental rule of procedure and that \"*each party must have the opportunity to address every formal motion before the tribunal and every legal issue raised by the case*\".159 The Applicants also rely on the *ad hoc* committee's decision in *Victor Pey Casado et al. v. Chile* in which the committee held that \"*there is a departure from the right to be heard [\u2026] when a party is not given a full, fair, or comparatively equal opportunity to state its case, present its defense, or produce evidence regarding every claim and issue at every stage of the arbitral proceeding*\".160 Citing the *TECO* annulment committee's decision, the Applicants go on to state that, while they recognize that a tribunal is not strictly limited to the arguments presented by the parties, a matter must be adequately pled, must remain \"*within the legal framework established by the parties*\" and the tribunal must not \"*surprise*\" the parties \"*with an issue that neither party has invoked, argued or reasonably could have anticipated during the proceedings*\". In the Applicants' view, if a tribunal determines that it lacks sufficient input from the parties on an issue that may prove determinative of the outcome of the case, it must, above all else, address its questions to the parties, even if this results in delay to the issuance of its award as due process takes priority over expediency.161\n\nApplication, \u00b6 63; Memorial, \u00b6 63. The Applicants state that this is from the *ad hoc* committee's decision in *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4 (December 22, 1989) (\"***MINE v. Guinea***\"). However, in their footnote 77, the Applicants refer to *Tulip v. Turkey*, \u00b6 80, AL-0005-ENG, to substantiate this proposition.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 63; Memorial, \u00b6 63, referring to *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Republic of Chile (December 18, 2012), \u00b6 184, AL-0010-ENG.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 31, referring to *TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v*. *Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision on Annulment (April 5, 2016) (\"***TECO v. Guatemala***\"), \u00b6 184, AL-0015-ENG.\n\n175.\n\nConcerning the second requirement on the \"*seriousness*\" of the departure from the rule, the Applicants agree that the departure must be more than minimal and be substantial such \"*as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide*\".162 Relying on the annulment committee's decision in *Wena Hotels Ltd v. Egypt*, the Applicants claim that \"*a serious violation is one that, had it not been made, could have resulted in the issuance of award with a significantly different result*\".163\n\nApplication, \u00b6 65, relying on *MINE* v *Guinea*, \u00b6 5.05, AL-0006-ENG/AL-0023-ENG.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 65; Memorial, \u00b6 65; Reply, \u00b6 27(ii). The Applicants cite Schreuer 2nd Commentary, \u00b6 287, AL-0017-ENG (citing *Wena Hotels v. Egypt*, \u00b6 52, AL-0028-ENG).\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent takes the position that both of the following requirements must be met: (i) a tribunal's non-compliance must pertain to a fundamental rule of procedure, and (ii) such non-compliance must be serious.164\n\nTranscript Day 1, 174: 3-11. *See also* Respondent's Opening Statement, pp. 71, 86; Respondent's slides used during its rebuttal presentation at the Hearing (\"**Respondent's Rebuttal Statement**\"), pp. 3-4.\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the articulation of the legal standard advanced by the Applicants. Specifically, it disagrees with the Applicants' contention that \"*if a tribunal determines that it lacks sufficient input from the parties on an issue that may prove determinative of the outcome of the case, it must, above all else, address its questions to the parties, even if it results in delay to the issuance of the award*\" since, in the Respondent's view, such an overbroad conclusion is not supported by any of the legal authorities submitted by the Applicants (referring to *MINE v. Guinea*; *Tulip v. Turkey*; *Casado v. Chile*; *TECO v. Guatemala*; *Fraport v. Philippines*).165 The Respondent refers to paragraph 82 of *Tulip v. Turkey*, in which the *ad hoc* committee noted that \"*[t]he right to be heard refers to the opportunity given to the parties to present their position. It does not relate to the manner in which tribunals deal with the arguments and evidence presented to them*\".166\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 68. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 52.\n\nTranscript Day 1, 166:6-12. *See also* Respondent's Opening Statement, p. 72.\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the decisions of the *TECO* and *Casado* annulment committees in any event do not support the Applicants' position in this case because the Applicants concede that they had pled on the limitations period issues during the Arbitration (even if *arguendo* they were made \"*out of an abundance of caution*\"), and thus the Tribunal's decision was \"*within the legal framework established by the parties*\".167\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 53.\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that the right to be heard is applicable to both questions of fact and law.168 It, however, objects to the Applicants' pleaded legal standard on the right to be heard because it arguably would deprive tribunals of any discretion in their independent appreciation of the applicable law during deliberations, and would further open almost every award in which a tribunal did not adopt the legal pleadings of one of the parties wholesale to annulment challenge.169\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 54.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 69. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 51.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Parties essentially agree on the two-prong test that must be applied by an annulment applicant to satisfy this ground for annulment, namely: i) the rule of procedure from which the tribunal allegedly departed must be fundamental (i.e. it must concern mandatory rules of natural justice and principles of judicial fairness) and ii) it must be shown that the departure from this rule is serious (i.e. it must be shown that it is more than \"minimal\").170 The Parties however differ on the interpretation of these requirements and the case law on which the Applicants rely.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62 and 65; Rejoinder, \u00b6 39; Transcript Day 1, 174:3-11. *See also* Respondent's Opening Statement, pp. 71, 86; Respondent's Rebuttal Statement, pp. 3-4.\n\n181.\n\nIn particular, the Applicants argue that a tribunal should not \"*surprise*\" the parties by raising an issue that was not invoked, or could not have been reasonably anticipated, during the proceedings, especially when that issue is outcome-determinative.171\n\nApplication, \u00b6 64; Reply, \u00b6 28, relying on *TECO v. Guatemala*, \u00b6 184, AL-0015-ENG, and *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision on the Application for Annulment of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide (December 23, 2010) (\"***Fraport v. Philippines***\"), \u00b6\u00b6 129, 178-179, 218-219, 224 and 247, AL-0016-ENG.\n\n182.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent contends that the Applicants give this annulment standard an \"*extreme meaning*\" which is not supported by the case law on which they rely. The Respondent further argues that if the Applicants' interpretation were to be accepted, this could be damaging to investment arbitration as \"*it would open almost every Award in which a Tribunal did not adopt the legal pleadings of one of the parties wholesale to annulment challenge*\".172\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 69. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 54.\n\n183.\n\nThe Committee finds that it is uncontroversial that the two-prong test of a \"*serious*\" and \"*fundamental*\" departure from a rule of procedure must be met for this ground of annulment to be satisfied. This has been confirmed by the decisions of a number of annulment committees. As held for instance by the *Wena* annulment committee:\n\n\"*The said provision [Article 52(1)(d)] refers to a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law. It is fundamental, as a matter of procedure, that each party is given the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal. This includes the right to state its claim or its defense and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it. This fundamental right has to be ensured on an equal level, in a way that allows each party to respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other.\"*173\n\n*Wena Hotels v. Egypt*, \u00b6 52, AL-0028-ENG.\n\n184.\n\nIt is trite law that the parties to a case must be heard and treated equally and fairly, including \u2013 as stated by the *Wena* committee \u2013 to be allowed to state their respective positions and defenses with the support of the relevant evidence on all issues that are raised by the other party or by the tribunal. The case law has also examined more particularly the right to be heard as a fundamental procedural principle in the context of this ground of annulment. In some cases, parties have argued that their right to be heard was violated because the relevant tribunal based its decision on arguments that were not advanced by the parties to the proceedings, or were not otherwise discussed during the proceedings, thus surprising the parties with an outcome that was not anticipated. The Committee considers that some of the decisions by annulment committees in this regard are sound and should guide its analysis in this case.\n\n185.\n\nAll these cases, including those on which the Applicants rely, have held, in one form or another, that a party must have the opportunity to present its case and the supporting evidence before the tribunal.174 At the same time, committees have found that tribunals were not precluded from formulating their own arguments even when these were not raised by the parties. Put it another way, while the parties must be afforded every opportunity to present their cases, advance their defenses and adduce the appropriate evidence, the fact that a tribunal does not refer to each and every argument put forward by the parties, does not ask specific questions, or even comes up with its own interpretation of the legal issues before it, does not necessarily amount to a violation of the right to be heard, as long as the tribunal remains within the bounds of the legal issues and authorities advanced by the parties. The committee's decision in *Klockner I* is pertinent in this regard. Having noted that a tribunal must remain \"*within the 'legal framework' established by*\" the parties, the committee added:\n\n*\"Within the dispute's \"legal framework\", arbitrators must be free to rely on arguments which strike them as the best ones, even if those arguments were not developed by the parties (although they could have been). Even if it is generally desirable for arbitrators to avoid basing their decision on an argument that has not been discussed by the parties, it obviously does not follow that they therefore commit a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\". Any other solution would expose arbitrators to having to do the work of the parties' counsel for them and would risk slowing down or even paralysing the arbitral solutions to disputes.\"*175\n\n*See* e.g. *Tulip v. Turkey,* \u00b6 80, AL-0005-ENG.\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon*, \u00b6 91, AL-0012-ENG.\n\n186.\n\nThus, insofar as a tribunal stays within the \"*legal framework*\" of the case, i.e. as long as it does not stray significantly from the legal issues and the parties' submissions as pleaded in the case, it is not precluded from using its own legal reasoning or from reaching different conclusions than those argued by the parties without seeking the parties' views in advance.176 As noted by the *Klockner I* committee, \"*whether to reopen the proceeding before reaching a decision and allow the parties to put forward their views on the arbitrators' 'new' thesis is rather a question of expedience\".*177\n\nSchreuer 2nd Commentary, \u00b6 317, AL-0017-ENG.\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon*, \u00b6 91, AL-0012-ENG.\n\n187.\n\nAnother important part of the Award is where the Tribunal states that \"*the record is equally clear that the Claimants did not view any of the Respondent's statements in early 2016 as a basis for forbearance in pursuing legal claims. Rather, the Claimants' response was consistent with a plan to push forward with litigation*\".178 Thus, in the Tribunal's view, the Claimants' conduct showed that they did not consider the Respondent's statements at the time as a basis to refrain from pursuing its legal actions. This was the Tribunal's interpretation of the documentary evidence submitted by the Parties in the light of their arguments and as such formed part of the Tribunal's adjudicatory function; in performing this function the Tribunal did not commit a breach of due process. The Applicants clearly do not share the Tribunal's view but the Committee cannot see any basis for a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, let alone a serious departure, in the circumstances of this case.\n\nAward, \u00b6 465, A-0001-ENG.\n\n188.\n\nAs to the element of surprise that a new approach adopted by a tribunal may have on the parties, this Committee shares the following view expressed by the committee in *Vivendi v. Argentina*:\n\n*\"It may be true that the particular approach adopted by the Tribunal in attempting to reconcile the various conflicting elements of the case before it came as a surprise to the parties, or at least to some of them. But even if true, this would by no means be unprecedented in judicial decision-making, either international or domestic, and it has nothing to do with the ground for annulment contemplated by Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\"*\n\n189.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee finds that a tribunal does not violate a party's right to be heard and does not commit a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention if it adopts a different approach to the analysis of the case than those presented by the parties or bases its decision on arguments that were not developed and discussed by the parties, as long as it remains within the legal framework established by the parties. The Committee will address the application of this standard to the present case in the following section.\n\n**(2) Application of the Legal Standard for Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure (Article 52(1)(d))**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Applicants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe Applicants submit that the Tribunal's decision to interpret the Armenian Civil Code \"*on its own*\" rather than to address questions to the Parties deprived them of their rights to be heard, particularly the rights of the Applicants whose claims were wrongfully dismissed on that basis, and consequently constituted a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.179 For the Applicants, had the Parties been afforded an opportunity to brief the Tribunal on its unique interpretation of the Armenian Civil Code, the Tribunal likely would not have dismissed the Applicants' claims.180\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 76, 79; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 76, 79.\n\nReply, \u00b6 38.\n\n191.\n\nThe Applicants further contend that the Tribunal wrongly interpreted the tolling provision to require the admission of a \"*wrongdoing*\", an interpretation that was never argued by the Parties and is not supported by the plain language of the statute, any judicial precedent or other Armenian law authorities.181\n\nApplication, \u00b6 10, referring to \u00b6\u00b6 459 and 466 of the Award, A-0001-ENG.\n\n192.\n\nThe Applicants take issue with the Tribunal's alleged inaction to inquire with the Parties during the Arbitration about the interpretation of the Armenian Civil Code, which was dispositive to the Tribunal's conclusion in the Award. The Applicants point out that, while the Parties had Armenian counsel retained for this case, the Tribunal, despite having no expertise on Armenian law, did not give the Parties any chance to opine on its interpretation during the course of the Arbitration, including during the two-week merits hearing and nearly two years of deliberation. Instead, the Tribunal decided to interpret the statute on its own by stating that \"*[n]one of the Parties has presented an expert on Armenian law to interpret these Civil Code provisions*\", which was untrue. Moreover, the Applicants underscore that the Tribunal directed the Parties to address entirely different issues in their post-hearing briefs, which led the Applicants to believe that the limitations period is unimportant, or at least that the Tribunal did not need any further assistance from the Parties in its interpretation.182\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 46-48, 53-54, 77-78; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 46-48, 53-54, 77-78; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 16-24, 39-41. *See also* Application, \u00b6 75(i); Memorial, \u00b6 75(i); Transcript Day 1, 41:10-23; Applicants' Rebuttal Statement, pp. 8-15.\n\n193.\n\nThe Applicants add that even during the written phase of the Arbitration leading up to the hearings, the Armenian limitations period was referenced only in a handful of paragraphs by the Parties in a \"*throwaway*\" manner. The Applicants aver that, on these occasions, they made clear that any such defense, if seriously pressed by the Respondent, would require further briefing, particularly on the questions of interruption. Therefore, while the Applicants do not seem to dispute that they addressed the limitations issue during the Arbitration, including their position in their first post-hearing brief that the Armenian limitations period was inapplicable because the Respondent's breaches of the Concession Agreements and the admissibility of their claims are governed by customary international law, they insist that this was done \"*only out of an abundance of caution*\" and argue that \"*Armenia cannot seriously contend that this passing treatment was sufficient to allow the Tribunal to correctly apply the statutory limitation period and (to the Claimants' great surprise) dismiss the claims on the basis of that provision*\".183\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 11-15, 18.\n\n194.\n\nThe Applicants further contend that given that the limitations period is an affirmative defence advanced by the Respondent in this case, the Tribunal should have dismissed the Respondent's such defence when it concluded that the Parties' pleadings were insufficient, rather than deciding to interpret it on its own and dismiss the Applicants' claims.184\n\nApplication, \u00b6 79; Memorial, \u00b6 79. *See also* Application, \u00b6 55; Memorial, \u00b6 55.\n\n195.\n\nAlso, it is the Applicants' position, as presented during the Hearing, that Armenian law requires that a court faced with such a limitation objection must conduct a rigorous investigation into all issues in a dedicated preliminary stage. As Armenia did not raise it during the bifurcated phase, such defence should be considered as waived under Article 168 of the Armenian Civil Procedure Code.185\n\nTranscript Day 1, 107:9-111:20. *See also* Applicants' Opening Statement, pp. 35-37.\n\n196.\n\nAdditionally, the Applicants state that the Tribunal also seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure when it provided its \"*general views*\" on the merits of the Applicants' contract-based claims, despite having held that it lacked jurisdiction over those claims.186\n\nApplication, \u00b6 129; Memorial, \u00b6 129; Reply, \u00b6 118. *See also* Application, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 75(vi); Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 75(vi).\n\n197.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's contentions in the Counter-Memorial, the Applicants object as follows: (i) the Applicants did not consent to the Tribunal's interpretation of the Armenian Civil Code; (ii) the Applicants did not take a \"*strategic choice*\" not to plead on the limitations period during the Arbitration, but it was rather a natural reaction to the Tribunal's evident lack of interest on this issue; (iii) the Applicants have consistently argued that both the Tribunal's interpretation and application of Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code were wrong; and (iv) given the intertwined nature of the Applicants' claims, the Award must be annulled in full.187\n\nReply, \u00b6 42-44, 128-129. *See also* Application, \u00b6 59; Memorial, \u00b6 59.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Applicants' claim that they were deprived of their rights to be heard during the Arbitration.188\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 39.\n\n199.\n\nFirst, the Respondent insists that the Applicants in fact admit that the Tribunal correctly interpreted the relevant provisions of Armenian law.189 According to the Respondent, the Tribunal did not interpret the word \"*debt*\" in Article 340 of the Armenian Civil Code to mean \"*wrongdoing*\" as the Applicants aver. The Respondent explains that, while the Tribunal used the word \"*wrongdoing*\" in the Award, it was not used in the context of interpreting Article 340 of the Code, but rather it was noted as one element when applying such Article to the facts at issue. For the Respondent, this is clear from the Award, including from the following passages: (i) \"*an 'acknowledgment of [a] debt' by an obligor to an obligee may reasonably lead the obligee to consider a dispute resolve at least at the level of principle, without the need to initiate a legal proceeding*\"; (ii) \"*the Tribunal interprets the phrase in Article 340(1) more broadly, to include an acknowledgment of an outstanding contractual obligation to another, which is either intended to, or would have the natural effect of, encouraging a counterparty to refrain from initiating legal action*\"; and (iii) \"*[w]hile not an 'acknowledgment of a debt' in the narrowest reading of Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code, statements acknowledging both Parties' ongoing contractual obligations to one another and professing a willingness to move forward could be seen as fulfilling the implicit broader purposes of the 'interruption' provision, namely, to stop a limitations period from running while one party continues to encourage and promise mutual performance rather than a resort to litigation*\".190\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 40-47. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 39, 48-50.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 42-47, referring to the Award, \u00b6\u00b6 456-459, 463-464, A-0001-ENG; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 33-38.\n\n200.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that the Applicants did explain their positions on the interpretation of the Armenian Civil Code during the Arbitration.\n\n201.\n\nReferring to multiple paragraphs of the Award, the Respondent explains that during the Arbitration, (i) in the counter-memorial, the Respondent \"*contend[ed] that the Claimants' claims under the Concession [Agreements] are time-barred under Armenian Law (the governing law of the Concession Agreements)*\" and submitted a translation of Article 340 of the Armenian Civil Code; (ii) in the reply, the Claimants argued substantively that the limitations period under Article 340 of the Armenian Civil Code may be interrupted, by referring only to the text of said Article; (iii) in the rejoinder and two post-hearing briefs, the Respondent made further submissions on the limitations period; and (iv) in its first post-hearing brief, the Claimants advanced their position on the interpretation of Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code and further argued, for the first time, that the Respondent had acknowledged its debt and \"introduce[d] the idea that the limitations period might be procedural in nature and not applicable\".191\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 48-54; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 16-20, 23, 25, 28-31, 41; Transcript Day 1, 149:12-141:16; Respondent's Opening Statement, pp. 73-77. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 3.\n\n202.\n\nThe Respondent draws the Committee's attention to the fact that the Applicants did not advance their arguments on the limitations period during the hearing and in their second post-hearing brief,192 despite the fact that the Respondent had made the following statement during the hearing:\n\n*\"\u2026statute of limitations, as we said at the outset, is three years here, and here is the Armenian law. And they filed more than three years after what they say is the valuation date*.\"193\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 55. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 31, 44.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 18, referring to the Revised Consolidated Hearing Transcript of the Arbitration, 215:21-216:1, A-0027-ENG.\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent further underscores that, contrary to the Applicants' contention, the Tribunal did not limit the Parties' arguments in the second post-hearing briefs. The Respondent refers to, *inter alia*, the following message conveyed by the President of the Tribunal to the Parties:194\n\n*\"I should preface by saying that one should not read anything into either the content of these questions nor the absence of questions on other parties of your briefs. These are not intended to be the most important issues, or perhaps even important issues at all. These were just notes I took and I am going to work through them in a somewhat random order, and read nothing into them, but there they are.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*[P]lease don't read anything into these questions. There are other topics that no doubt would interest us and that you will wish to comment on anyway.\"*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, referring to the Revised Consolidated Hearing Transcript of the Arbitration, 1892:17-25, 1909:1-3, A-0027-ENG.\n\n204.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Applicants never took the limitations period seriously during the Arbitration, in contrast to the Respondent and the Tribunal which did.195 The Respondent thus stresses that it was the Applicants' strategic choice not to plead more on Armenian law during the Arbitration, which refutes the Applicants' current position that they had been deprived of their right to be heard.196\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 55. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 18.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 56-59; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 41, 44-46.\n\n205.\n\nThird, the Respondent claims that the Tribunal closely analysed the evidence in the record, including the evidence introduced by the Applicants concerning the Armenian limitations period, when rendering the Award.\n\n206.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent refers to, *inter alia*, paragraph 458 of the Award in which the Tribunal held, in the context of applying Article 340 of the Armenian Civil Code, that \"*[t]he Claimants contend that this requirement was satisfied by the Respondent's statements on three occasions (15 February 2016, 18 March 2016, and 3 July 2017), each of which accordingly interrupted the statute of limitations. The Tribunal has examined these statements closely*\". The Tribunal thus reached the opposite conclusion from the Applicants' position \"*on its own*\" on the basis of the evidence presented before it and by interpreting a statutory provision in accordance with its ordinary meaning. In the Respondent's view, nothing in the record suggests that the Tribunal imperfectly performed its decision-making power.197 The Respondent also takes issue with the Applicants' remarks during the Hearing that the Respondent \"*acknowledged outstanding legal obligations in at least four communications*\", by including the email communication of April 5, 2016 as the fourth communication, as such position contradicts their earlier position during the Arbitration, which allegedly shows the Applicants' opportunistic behavior.198\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 60-63; Rejoinder, \u00b6 31. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, 47.\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal Statement, pp. 30-34.\n\n207.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent disagrees with the Applicants' view that the Tribunal \"*narrowed its interpretation of Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code in application*\". For the Respondent, the Tribunal rightly held that (i) the Respondent continued to deny any breach on its part; (ii) the Respondent consistently maintained that the Concession Agreements were not terminated; and (iii) the limitations period was not interrupted in any event because the Applicants did not rely on the Respondent's contemporaneous statements in any way.199\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 64-67. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 31, 40.\n\n208.\n\nFourth, the Respondent contends that the Applicants' assertions under this annulment ground only pertain to Rasia's claims, but not Mr. Borkowski's BIT claims or the Tribunal's determination on causation and damages. Therefore, even if successful, the Application can only amount to a partial annulment of the Award.200\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 181, 185. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 147-152.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nIn support of this ground of annulment the Applicants argue that the Tribunal did not afford the Parties an opportunity to submit arguments on the Tribunal's \"*unique and counter-textual*\" interpretation of the Armenian Civil Code which was dispositive of the Tribunal's conclusions in the Award. The Applicants assert that the Tribunal decided to interpret Article 340(1) of the Armenian Code of Civil Procedure \"*largely on its own*\" and did not put \"*its invented legal requirements*\" to the Parties and their Armenian legal experts.201 It is the Applicants' position that the Tribunals' requirements were \"*entirely unforeseeable to the Parties given that they (i) find no support in the text of the Code, nor in Armenian legal authority; and (ii) were never raised by the Tribunal or either Party at any time during the three-year arbitration\".*202 The Applicants submit that, had the Tribunal put this matter to the Parties, it would likely have not dismissed the Applicants' claims.203\n\nTranscript Day 1, 93:11-18, 106:3-11; Applicants' Opening Statement, pp. 34-35.\n\nTranscript Day 1, p. 93, lines 11-18, p. 106, lines 3-11; Applicants' Opening Statement, p. 35.\n\nReply, \u00b6 38.\n\n210.\n\nAs to the meaning of \"*serious*\", the Applicants endorse the statement in *MINE v. Guinea* that the departure \"*must be substantial and such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide*\".204 The Applicants add that this includes situations where the violation has a significant impact on the award.205 The Applicants further contend, relying on *TECO v. Guatemala* and *Fraport v. Philippines*, that a tribunal must not surprise the parties with an issue that \"*neither party has invoked, argued or reasonably could have anticipated during the proceedings\"*, particularly with regard to outcome-determinative issues.206 The Respondent relies on the *Tulip* annulment decision to argue that the \"*seriousness*\" test is met when the observance of a rule has the potential to lead to a substantially different award and the departure is \"*more than minimal*\".207 The Respondent also contends that *Fraport* should be distinguished because arguments on the statute of limitations were made during the Arbitration and no new evidence had been introduced by the Tribunal.208\n\nReply, \u00b6 27, citing *MINE* v *Guinea*, \u00b6 5.05, AL-0006-ENG/AL-0023-ENG.\n\nReply, \u00b6 27. *See also* Transcript Day 2, p. 252, lines 16-23.\n\nReply, \u00b6 28, citing *TECO v. Guatemala* \u00b6 184, AL-0015-ENG; *Fraport v. Philippines*, \u00b6\u00b6 129, 178-179, 218-219, 224 and 247, AL-0016-ENG.\n\nTranscript Day 2, 280:17-25; Respondent's Opening Statement, p. 86. In its Rebuttal Statement, at p. 3, the Respondent also refers to *TECO v. Guatemala*, \u00b6 85, ALA-0015-ENG, which states that a committee can determine \"*whether the tribunal's compliance with a rule of procedure could potentially have affected the award*\".\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal Statement, p. 12.\n\n211.\n\nAs noted above, there is no question that the right to be heard is a fundamental rule of procedure and that a tribunal must ensure that parties have had an opportunity to brief the tribunal on the questions of law and fact on which the award is based. The Committee has reviewed the record of the original Arbitration with a view to examining whether the Parties did present arguments on the statute of limitations under Armenian law. The Committee notes that the Respondent raised the question of the statute of limitations concerning Rasia's contractual claims under Armenian law at the earliest possible time in the proceeding, i.e. with its counter-memorial. In that pleading, the Respondent argued that, given that the Concessions Agreements are governed by Armenian law, Rasia's contractual claims were time-barred under Articles 332 and 337(1) of the Armenian Civil Code and had thus expired.209 The Respondent further submitted that the fact that Rasia's contractual claims expired by virtue of the statute of limitations under Armenian law also means that claims under the umbrella clause were untimely.210\n\nArbitration Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 222-225.\n\nArbitration Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 225.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants/Applicants in the Arbitration rebutted the Respondent's arguments in their reply and argued that the Armenian limitations period did not apply because Armenia's breaches of the Concession Agreements are governed by customary international law.211 The Claimants/Applicants also relied on the provisions of Armenian civil law on the interruption of the limitation period, specifically Article 340 of the Civil Code which provides as follows: \"*Running of the statute of limitations shall be interrupted by the filing of a claim in the prescribed manner, as well as by performing actions evidencing the acknowledgement of the debt by the person obliged*.\"212\n\nArbitration Reply, \u00b6 606.\n\nArbitration Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 601-607.\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondent advanced some rebuttal arguments on this topic in its rejoinder where it maintained that the Armenian limitations period barred the claims and argued that the limitations period could only be interrupted by the filing of a court action since a letter providing notice of a dispute is not sufficient under Armenian law.213\n\nArbitration Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 340-345.\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimants/Applicants did not address the question of the statute of limitations at the Arbitration hearing, in their opening or otherwise, while the Respondent referred to this question in two slides of its presentation and made several remarks on this topic during its opening.214 It is worth noting incidentally that the hearing in the Arbitration was held in two parts, for a total of thirteen days: the first part on February 16-26, 2021 and the second on April 26 and 27, 2021.215 It follows that the Claimants/Applicants also had these opportunities to present their defence and rebut the Respondent's arguments on the statute of limitations.\n\nSlides 14, and 92 of the Respondent's Opening Presentation of the Arbitration, A-0040-ENG; Revised Consolidated Hearing Transcript of the Arbitration, 149:1-11, 215:21-25, 216:1, 222:7-12, A-0027-ENG.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 73 and 88, A-0001-ENG.\n\n215.\n\nThe Claimants/Applicants returned to this issue in their first post-hearing brief where they submitted that, even if, *arguendo*, recourse to Armenian procedural law were appropriate to interpret the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Respondent's acknowledgment of its obligations under the Concession Agreements interrupted the statute of limitations on July 3, 2017 at the latest.216\n\nClaimants' First Arbitration Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 306-310, A-0029-ENG.\n\n216.\n\nIn its first and second post-hearing briefs, the Respondent maintained its argument that Rasia's contractual and umbrella clause claims were also time-barred by Armenia's three-year statute of limitations.217 The Claimants/Applicants did not address the question of the statute of limitations in their second post-hearing brief.\n\nRespondent's First Arbitration Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 171 and 221, A-0028-ENG; Respondent's Second Arbitration Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 1(ii) and 27, RA-0010-ENG.\n\n217.\n\nIt is important to recall that, in the Arbitration, the Claimants/Applicants accepted that the applicable limitations period for their contract claims under Armenian law is three years, that their alleged \"*valuation date*\" is March 18, 2015, and that the arbitration commenced on July 19, 2018, more than three years later.218 Further, while the Claimants/Applicants contended that the statute of limitations was interrupted by a letter of December 16, 2015, notifying Armenia of the dispute, and by other actions by Armenia \"*evidencing the acknowledgement of the debt*\", no mention was made in any of the Parties' submissions in the Arbitration, nor at the hearing, of Article 333 of the Armenian Civil Code, to which the Applicants refer in these annulment proceedings and which provides for a 10-year (rather than 3-year) limitations period, \"*[w]here the violation of the right of a person has caused damage to him or her and the violation is associated with entering into transactions as prescribed by this Code or with corrupt activity in the course of making those transactions*\".219 Similarly, while the Applicants in these proceedings appear to argue that the Tribunal should have conducted \"*an effective examination*\" of the issue relating to the statute of limitations, akin to the preliminary procedure that is apparently carried out by Armenian courts when examining a motion to apply a statute of limitations pursuant to Article 168 of the Armenian Civil Code,220 no such argument was raised in the Arbitration by the Claimants/Applicants.\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6136.\n\nReply, \u00b6 4(ii); Armenian Civil Code, p. 226, RA-0015-ENG.\n\nTranscript Day 1, pp. 107-111; Applicants' Opening Statement, pp. 36-37.\n\n218.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Applicants sought to justify the fact that they did not raise more arguments on the statute of limitations in the Arbitration by stating that it would have been \"*strange*\" for them to devote several pages to \"*an issue that barely surfaced at all*\".221 The Applicants further contended that the question of whether the claims under the Concession Agreements were time-barred was \"*virtually [] invisible*\" when seen \"*across the panoply of all the hundreds of arguments that were raised*\".222 However, in the light of the record of the Arbitration as summarized above, it is hard for the Committee to agree with the Applicants' contentions. Quite to the contrary, it is clear that the question of the statute of limitations was a live issue and that both Parties exchanged arguments on it in their submissions. Consequently, when the Tribunal ruled on this question, it did not stray away from the \"*legal framework*\" established by the Parties, to borrow the expression employed by the *Kl\u00f6ckner I* committee cited above, but remained well within the boundaries of what had been argued between the Parties.\n\nTranscript Day 2, 230:24-231:2.\n\nTranscript Day 2, 223:18-23.\n\n219.\n\nThe Applicants contend that they were deprived of their right to be heard because the Tribunal ventured its own interpretation of the statute of limitations and \"*invented new legal requirements*\"223 without asking the Parties or their Armenian lawyers specific questions about any of this, even though the Tribunal did ask a number of questions during the two hearings held in the Arbitration. The Applicants go as far as stating that the Tribunal \"*affirmatively guided the Parties and their counsel away from addressing that statutory provision by directing them to focus on other interpretative questions during the two hearings and in their post-hearing submissions\".*224\n\nTranscript Day 2, 232:6-7.\n\nReply, \u00b6 2(i).\n\n220.\n\nThe Committee cannot accept the Applicants' allegations that the Tribunal failed to respect their right to be heard. As recalled above, written and oral submissions were presented by the Parties on the statute of limitations at every stage of the arbitral proceedings. If the Applicants chose, for their own reasons, not to address and rebut more extensively the Respondent's arguments in this regard, including by raising some of the defences that they put forward in these annulment proceedings for the first time, that was part of their strategic approach to the case the consequence of which they must bear and the Tribunal cannot be blamed for that.\n\n221.\n\nWith regard to the Applicants' complaint that the Tribunal somehow led the Parties astray by asking certain questions and by not raising questions about the statute of limitations at the hearing, it is impossible for the Committee to accept the Applicants' contention. The Parties to the Arbitration were of course free, as is always the case in international arbitration, to address in their post-hearing briefs any topic that was discussed at the hearing and that they considered important to the resolution of the case. In this particular instance, the Claimants/Applicants could have further briefed the Tribunal on the question of the statute of limitations, which was a very significant issue as it might have been dispositive of the case (as it ultimately was).\n\n222.\n\nMoreover, it is good practice for parties not to read too much on questions that a tribunal may ask during arbitral proceedings. In this case, the President of the Tribunal appeared to have anticipated this risk as she carefully prefaced her questions with these words:\n\n\"*[O]ne should not read anything into either the content of these questions nor the absence of questions on other parties of your briefs. These are not intended to be the most important issues, or perhaps even important issues at all. These were just notes I took and I am going to work through them in a somewhat random order, and read nothing into them, but there they are*.\"225\n\nRevised Consolidated Hearing Transcript of the Arbitration, 1892:17-25, A-0027-ENG.\n\n223.\n\nThese directions are clear and could not be farther from the allegation that the Tribunal \"*affirmatively guided the Parties and their counsel away from addressing that statutory provision*\" as the Applicants contend.\n\n224.\n\nThe Applicants also assert that the Parties' \"*exceedingly sparce treatment of the topic\u2026 did not reflect a 'strategic choice' but rather the Parties' natural reaction to the Tribunal's evident lack of interest in this statutory provision, based on its failure to ask a single question about it during two hearings and during the entire two-year post-hearing phase*\".226 However, an arbitral tribunal is under no obligation to ask questions and the fact that a tribunal refrains from asking specific questions on a particular topic should not be interpreted as lack of interest for that topic. Parties should put forward their respective cases on the basis of the arguments and evidence \u2013 including expert evidence on domestic law, if applicable \u2013 that they consider relevant in order to prevail in an arbitration and not on the basis of speculation as to what might be a tribunal's thinking or its understanding of the case. Moreover, it is not for an arbitral tribunal to put questions to the parties in order to advance lines of argument that their counsel failed to make. As held by the *Kl\u00f6ckner I* committee, \"*it should be recalled that as a rule an application for annulment cannot serve as a substitute for an appeal against an award and permit criticism of the merits of the judgments rightly or wrongly formulated by the award. Nor can it be used by one party to complete or develop an argument which it could and should have made during the arbitral proceeding or help that party retrospectively to fill gaps in its arguments*\".227\n\nReply, \u00b6 43.\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon*, Decision on Annulment, 3 May 1985, \u00b6 83, AL-0012-ENG.\n\n225.\n\nThe Applicants further argue that the Tribunal's failure to give the Parties an opportunity to make submissions on the Tribunal's own interpretation of the statute \"*resulted in a serious deprivation of the parties' due process rights, particularly the rights of the Claimants, whose claims were wrongfully dismissed on that basis*\" and this is when \"*ordinarily, the consequences of an alleged pleading deficiency falls on the party \u2013 in this case Armenia \u2013 which sponsored the affirmative defence at issue, not, as in this case, the party responding to that defence*\".228 Without entering into questions of allocations of burden of proof which do not fall within its remit, the Committee finds that this is another way of advancing the same argument, i.e. criticizing the Tribunal for the Parties' own failure to develop their arguments in the Arbitration. Moreover, as noted above, the Committee does not agree that the Tribunal violated a fundamental rule of procedure because it interpreted its statute of limitations as it did. The Parties were never deprived of the opportunity to put forward their arguments and defences \u2013 to the contrary, as discussed above, they had ample opportunity to do so.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 79; Memorial \u00b6 79.\n\n226.\n\nThe Committee is of the opinion that the case law cited by the Applicants does not support their argument that the Applicants' right to be heard under Article 52(1)(d) was violated because the Tribunal reached its decision on the basis of a theory that the Parties did not have the opportunity to discuss fully. While the Committee acknowledges that the cases on which the Applicants rely, *MINE v. Guinea*, *Tulip v. Turkey*, *Pey Casado v. Chile*, *TECO v. Guatemala* and *Fraport v. Philippines*,229 contain definitions of the terms \"serious\" and \"fundamental\" in the context of Article 52(1)(d), they do not always deal with the right to be heard (as is the case in *MINE v. Guinea*) nor do they extend the legal standard of Article 52(1)(d) to situations where the parties did present before the tribunal all the arguments and evidence that they deemed relevant, as was the case in the present instance. Nor do these cases support the Applicants' argument that a tribunal must necessarily ask questions to the parties before it advances its own theory.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 62-64; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 62-64.\n\n227.\n\nTo the extent that the Applicants state that they were surprised by the Tribunal's interpretation of the Armenian statute, this may have been the case, but the Committee is unable to find anything in the Tribunal's conduct that was so arbitrary and unexpected to represent a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Having carefully reviewed the Award, the Committee is of the opinion that the Tribunal, having heard the Parties on the issue of the statute of limitations, did nothing more than analyse and interpret the provisions of the Armenian Civil Code which the Parties agreed were applicable to the time bar of Rasia's breach of contract claims (Articles 332, 337 and 340 of the Armenian Civil Code).230\n\nAward, \u00b6 445, A-0001-ENG.\n\n228.\n\nWith regard to the fact that the Tribunal allegedly replaced the word \"*debt*\" with the word \"*wrongdoing*\" in interpreting Article 340(1) of the Armenian Civil Code, this question has already been discussed at paragraphs 157-168 above. The same reasoning applies *mutatis mutandis* to this ground of annulment and, on that basis, the Committee reaches the conclusion that there was no violation of a fundamental rule of procedure also in this regard.\n\n229.\n\nThe Applicants further claim that the Tribunal should not have provided its \"*general views*\" on the merits of the Claimants'/Applicants' contract-based claims and that, by doing so, it seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n230.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Award devotes a paragraph to explain that, \"*[g]iven the way the treaty claims have been presented, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to provide its general views on the underlying contractual claims, as a prelude to considering the BIT claims that remain for resolution*\".231 This was because, as the Tribunal explains, the Parties \"*presented those treaty claims as very much interwoven with the question of whether, and to what extent, Rasia and/or Armenia performed their respective contractual obligations*\".232\n\nAward, \u00b6 472, A-0001-ENG.\n\nAward, \u00b6 472, A-0001-ENG.\n\n231.\n\nAs an introduction to the section of the Award entitled \"*Liability*\" the Tribunal explained that it began with a summary of the Parties' positions on the alleged breach of contractual obligations and an analysis of those positions \"*[f]or clarity of exposition, and because many of the treaty claims in this case are predicated upon compliance or non-compliance with underlying rights and obligations arising from the Concession Agreements*\".233 The Tribunal also observed that \"*[s]ome of the arguments concerning a breach of contractual obligations are similar to the allegations that the Respondent acted arbitrarily in violation of the BIT*\".234 These descriptions make it clear that the Tribunal felt it necessary to provide some \"*general*\" views on the Claimants/Applicants' contractual claims, in spite of its conclusion that they were time-barred, because of the way the case had been pleaded by the Parties. The Committee is thus satisfied that the Tribunal provided sufficient explanations for its reasoning \u2013 all the more so that this reasoning did not affect the ultimate outcome of the case. As the Tribunal specifically stated in the Award, \"*the only relevance of the Tribunal's findings regarding the Road Concession (\u2026) is the extent to which they may inform the analysis of Mr. Borkowski's BIT claims, which are not time-barred*\".235\n\nAward, \u00b6 474, A-0001-ENG.\n\nAward, \u00b6 472, A-0001-ENG.\n\nAward, \u00b6 544, A-0001-ENG.\n\n232.\n\nIt follows from the above that the Tribunal did not depart from a fundamental rule of procedure when it provided its general views on the contractual claims.\n\n233.\n\nGiven the Committee's conclusions on this ground of annulment, the Respondent's argument that only partial annulment is permissible in this case is moot.\n\n234.\n\nIn the light of the above, it is the Committee's conclusion that in the circumstances of this case, even if the Tribunal's analysis might have been unexpected by the Applicants, it fell within the legal and factual framework established by the Parties and cannot be successfully challenged on the ground that the Applicants did not anticipate it, or analysed and developed it insufficiently in their submissions during the Arbitration. It follows that there was no serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by the Tribunal in this case.\n\n**C. Ground 3: Failure to State Reasons on which the Award is Based (Article 52(1)(E))**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Applicable Legal Standard of Review for Failure to State Reasons (Article 52(1)(e))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Applicants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nThe Applicants submit that generally there is a failure to state reasons within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention if a tribunal's failure to address a particular question submitted to it might have affected its ultimate decision. While accepting that a tribunal cannot be required to address each and every piece of evidence in the record within its award, the Applicants insist that this cannot be construed to mean that a tribunal can simply gloss over evidence upon which the parties have placed significant emphasis, without any analysis and without explaining why it found that evidence insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory.236 Likewise, for the Applicants, \"*insufficient*\" and \"*inadequate*\" reasons can also result in annulment, especially so when the reasons supplied are so deficient and inaccurate.237\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.\n\n236.\n\nReferring to other *ad hoc* committees' rulings, the Applicants state that this provision of the ICSID Convention requires that readers can understand the facts and law applied by the tribunal in coming to its conclusion or that reasons in an award are adequate and sufficiently reasonable to bring about the result reached by the tribunal.238 According to the Applicants, if there is no express rationale for the conclusion with respect to a pivotal or outcome-determinative point, an annulment must follow, whether the lack of rationale is due to a complete absence of reasons or the result of frivolous or contradictory explanations.239\n\nApplication, \u00b6 73; Memorial, \u00b6 73.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 74; Memorial, \u00b6 74.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the annulment committee's decision in *Rumeli Telekom v. Kazakhstan*, in which the committee held, *inter alia*, that \"*an* ad hoc *committee is entitled itself to seek to understand the reasons for the award from the record before the tribunal. Indeed, in appropriate cases, it should do so. As the* ad hoc *Committee held in* Soufraki*: [i]t is also possible that a tribunal may give reasons for its award without elaborating the factual or legal bases of such reasons, so long as those reasons in fact make it possible reasonably to connect the facts or law of the case to the conclusions reached in the award, annulment may appropriately be avoided*\".240\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 178-179. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 145.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe Committee recalls that Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention provides that an award shall state the reasons upon which it is based. Arbitration Rule 59(1)(i) provides that the award shall contain \"*the decisions of the Tribunal on every question submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which the decision is based*\".\n\n239.\n\nSeveral committees have held that it does not matter for purposes of annulment whether a tribunal's reasoning is correct or convincing; what matters is that the flow of the reasoning can be followed to its conclusion. The Applicants have referred to the holding by the *MINE v. Guinea* Committee that \"*the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law*\".241 The Respondent relies on a passage of the *Rumeli Telekom AS v. Kazakhstan* annulment Decision citing in turn the *Soufraki* decision holding that \"*[i]t is also possible that a tribunal may give reasons for its award without elaborating the factual or legal bases of such reasons, so long as those reasons in fact make it possible reasonably to connect the facts or law of the case to the conclusions reached in the award, annulment may appropriately be avoided*\".242\n\n*MINE, v. Guinea*, \u00b6 5.09, AL-0006-ENG/AL-0023-ENG.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 178, Rejoinder, \u00b6 145 and Respondent's Opening Statement, p. 119.\n\n240.\n\nThere also appears to be agreement in the case law of annulment committees that the requirement to state reasons is intended to ensure that parties can understand the reasoning of the tribunal, meaning that the reader can understand the facts and the law applied by the tribunal in coming to its conclusions. The correctness of the reasoning or whether it is persuasive is however not relevant for the task of *ad hoc* committees.243\n\nUpdated ICSID Background Paper on Annulment, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 105, RAL-0002-ENG.\n\n241.\n\nThe Committee considers that the absence of adequate or sufficient legal reasoning in an award, but not whether such reasoning is correct or persuasive, may amount to a failure to state reasons within the meaning of Art. 52(1)(e), and will apply this legal standard to the circumstances of this case.\n\n**(2) Application of the Legal Standard for Failure to State Reasons (Article 52(1)(e))**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. The Applicants' Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nFirst, the Applicants submit that the Tribunal's \"*general views*\" on the merits of their contract-based claims in the Award, which are highly selective and superficial, constitutes a failure to state reasons.244\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 129; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 129; Reply, \u00b6 118. *See also* Application, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 75(vi); Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 75(vi).\n\n243.\n\nSecond, the Applicants contend that the Tribunal's failure to explain, in the context of the commencement date of the limitations period, why it did not consider the Respondent's breaches of the Concession Agreements after March 18, 2015, without providing explanation or justification, warrants annulment of the Award because it led to the wrong conclusion, which was outcome determinative, that all of the Applicants' contract-based claims were time-barred.245 To the extent that the Tribunal suggests that it did consider these additional breaches by the Respondent, the Applicants aver that the Tribunal glossed over evidence upon which they had placed significant emphasis.246\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 130-134; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 130-134; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 119-123, 124. *See also* Application, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 75(vi); Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 75(vi).\n\nApplication, \u00b6 135; Memorial, \u00b6 135; Reply, \u00b6 124.\n\n244.\n\nThird, the Applicants reject the Respondent's assertions in its pleadings that the Applicants' arguments under this ground only pertain to Rasia's claims, but not Mr. Borkowski's claims or the Tribunal's determination on causation and damages. For the Applicants, this ignores the intertwined nature of their claims because had the Tribunal allowed the umbrella clause claim to proceed, this would have enabled the Applicants to seek a merits review of their claims. In other words, given that Rasia's and Mr. Borkowski's claims were overlapping causes of action, a finding that the Tribunal was wrong to bar the Applicants' umbrella claims suffices to annul the Award in full. In the same vein, a finding that the Tribunal erred in barring the Applicants' claims should result in an annulment in full, according to the Applicants.247\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 128-129. *See also* Application, \u00b6 59; Memorial, \u00b6 59.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Award clearly provides reasons of its decisions.248\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 180.\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Applicants' contention that \"*the Tribunal either has jurisdiction, in which case it should proceed to the merits; or it lacks jurisdiction, in which case it lacks authority to rule on the merits*\" is off the point as the Award held that the claims were inadmissible, but not that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear these claims. The Applicants' position in this regard is also incorrect, in the Respondent's view, as the Tribunal made it clear in the Award that it has jurisdiction over the BIT claims brought by Mr. Borkowski (with the exception of the umbrella clause claim).249 In other words, the Tribunal ruled on the merits because these claims had to be resolved on the merits and the Tribunal's ruling was therefore necessary and appropriate.250\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 161-165.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 144.\n\n247.\n\nRegarding the Applicants' complaint that the Tribunal failed to consider the Respondent's breaches after March 18, 2015 without providing explanation or justification, the Respondent explains that the Tribunal did take those facts into account but nevertheless decided that the limitations period began on March 18, 2015 because (i) the Applicants themselves stated that this date was \"*the date on which the Claimants were substantially and irreversibly deprived of their investments*\"; (ii) the Tribunal found, based on the record of the case, that the Applicants had failed to prove their theory of either continuous or egregious breaches of the Concession Agreements; and (iii) it is untrue that this was the \"*Claimants' core argument*\".251\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 161-177.\n\n248.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the Applicants' assertions under this annulment grounds only pertain to Rasia's claims, but not Mr. Borkowski's BIT claims or the Tribunal's determination on causation and damages. Therefore, even if successful, the Application can only result in a partial annulment of the Award.252\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 184-185. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 147-152.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nThe Applicants' arguments under this third ground of annulment are three-pronged. The Applicants first assert that the Tribunal provided \"*general views*\" on the merits of their contractual claims in spite of its finding that both Rasia's claims and Mr. Borkowski's umbrella clause claims were time-barred.253 Second, the Applicants contend that the Tribunal failed to explain why it arbitrarily determined that the limitations period commenced on March 18, 2015 and ignored the Respondent's alleged breaches of the Concession Agreements after that date, reaching a decision that was outcome-determinative.254 Third, the Applicants emphasize that their arguments on this ground concern both Rasia's claims and Mr. Borkowski's umbrella claims, as these are intertwined and therefore the Award should be annulled in its entirety.255\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 129 and 56, 75(vi); Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 14, 129 and 56, 75(vi); Reply \u00b6 118.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 130-134 and 56, 75(vi); Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 130-134, and 56, 75(vi); Reply \u00b6\u00b6 119-124.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 128-129. *See also* Application, \u00b6 59; Memorial, \u00b6 59.\n\n250.\n\nAs discussed above, the Committee finds that the Tribunal made it clear in the Award why it provided \"*its general views on the underlying contractual claims*\" even though it held that both Rasia's claims and Mr. Borkowski's umbrella clause claims were time-barred under the Concession Agreements. The Tribunal explained that it wished to do so, not only because the Parties had devoted much time to briefing these issues, but \"*[m]ore fundamentally (\u2026) because the time bar for these particular claims does not dispose of the case*\". The Tribunal went on to state as follows:\n\n*\"Mr. Borkowski asserts a number of other treaty claims under the BIT, which are not subject to an equivalent time bar derived from Armenia's limitations period for breach of contract claims. Yet the Parties have presented those treaty claims as very much interwoven with the question of whether, and to what extent, Rasia and/or Armenia performed their respective contractual obligations. Given the way the treaty claims have been presented, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to provide its general views on the underlying contractual claims, as a prelude to considering the BIT claims that remain for resolution.*\"256\n\nAward, \u00b6 472, A-0001-ENG.\n\n251.\n\nIt is obvious from this language that \u2013 contrary to what the Applicants contend \u2013 this part of the Award only deals with Mr. Borkowski's treaty claims, which were distinct from the contractual claims and still had to be addressed and decided separately on the merits. In addition, as the Tribunal explains in this passage of the Award, given the \"*interwoven*\" way in which the Parties presented the treaty claims in the Arbitration, it was necessary to address the contractual claims \"*as a prelude*\" to the treaty claims. Therefore, in subsequent paragraphs of the Award, the Tribunal provided a summary of the Parties' positions regarding the alleged breach of contractual obligations followed by an analysis of those positions \"*for clarity of exposition and because many of the treaty claims in this case are predicated on contentions about compliance or non-compliance with underlying rights and obligations arising from the Concession Agreements*\".257\n\nAward, \u00b6 474, A-0001-ENG.\n\n252.\n\nThe Committee finds these explanations clear and sufficient; the reasoning of the Tribunal follows logically and can be easily understood. Consequently, in the Committee's opinion, the Tribunal did not fail to state the reasons why it provided some general views on Rasia's contractual claims before it dealt with Mr. Borkowski's treaty claims.\n\n253.\n\nAs to the Applicants' second argument that the Tribunal failed to consider the Respondent's alleged breaches after March 18, 2015, the Committee has already noted above that this date was hardly arbitrary or plucked out of the air by the Tribunal. As recalled in the Award, the Claimants/Applicants themselves consistently pleaded in the Arbitration that March 18, 2015 \"*was the day that Claimants say they learned of the most significant violation of Rasia's Concession rights, which caused 'irreversibl[e]' loss to their investment*\".258 Thus, the Tribunal clearly explained why this was the most logical starting date to apply to the prescription period.\n\nAward, \u00b6 449, A-0001-ENG.\n\n254.\n\nFinally, as to the Applicants' contention that a finding that the Tribunal erred in barring their claims should result in annulment in full of the Award,259 the Committee notes that, in light of its findings above that the Award should not be annulled under any of the grounds put forward by the Applicants, there is no need to address this last argument.\n\nReply, \u00b6 129.\n\n**D. Award on Costs**\n---------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n255.\n\nIn the Rebuttal Statements, the Applicants contended that should the Committee (partially) annul the Award, the Committee should also annul the Tribunal's finding on costs in the Award.260\n\nTranscript Day 2, 258:23-260:19. *See also* Applicants' Rebuttal Statement, pp. 29-32.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nIn the light of the Committee's dismissal above of the Applicants' grounds for annulment, the question of the possible annulment of the Tribunal's findings on costs in the Award is moot.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A. The Applicants' Cost Submissions**\n---------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nIn their Memorial and Reply, the Applicants request that the Committee order the Respondent to bear all costs of these annulment proceedings, including the cost of the Applicants' legal representation, as well as all costs of the Applicants in the Arbitration proceedings, with interest.261\n\nApplication, \u00b6 145(iii); Memorial, \u00b6 145(iii); Reply, \u00b6 130(ii).\n\n258.\n\nAccording to their submission on costs dated August 12, 2024, which was further amended by their letter of September 6, 2024, the Applicants incurred USD 1,581,024.86, for which they seek recovery, as follows:262\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Category | Amount |\n| ICSID Fees | USD 425,000.00 |\n| Armenia Counsel, Security Bond, and Other | USD 161,209.79 |\n| Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan | USD 994,815.07 |\n\nApplicants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 2; Affidavit of Mr. Joseph K. Borkowski dated August 12, 2024; Applicants' letter dated September 6, 2024; Affidavit of Mr. Joseph K. Borkowski dated September 6, 2024.\n\n259.\n\nThe Applicants further submit that should the Committee decide that each Party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses and that the costs of the annulment proceeding shall be shared equally by both Parties, the Committee should order the Respondent to reimburse the Applicants half of the costs of this annulment proceeding.263\n\nApplicants' Rebuttal Statement, p. 33.\n\n260.\n\nThe Applicants add that they should not bear the Respondent's legal costs and expenses in any event because the Applicants' concerns were not frivolous and were presented efficiently and in good faith.264\n\nApplicants' Rebuttal Statement, p. 33.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Cost Submissions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder, the Respondent requests that the Committee render a decision ordering the Applicants to pay the Respondent's costs in these annulment proceedings in an amount to be specified, including all attorneys' fees and expenses in connection with these proceedings, and all fees and expenses of the *ad hoc* Committee and the ICSID Secretariat, together with interest thereon.265\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 194; Rejoinder, p. 86.\n\n263.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Respondent has wasted time and effort due to the Applicants' frivolous and inaccurate pleadings.267\n\nTranscript Day 1, 203:3-204:9. *See also* Respondent's Opening Statement, pp. 129-135.\n\n**C. The Committee's Decision on Costs**\n----------------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n265.\n\nThis provision, together with Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applied by virtue of Arbitration Rule 53) gives the Committee discretion to allocate all costs of the proceeding, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n266.\n\nThe Committee endorses the \"costs follow the event\" approach as a general guide for the allocation of costs in this proceeding.\n\n267.\n\nThe costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\nCommittee Members' fees and expenses\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ms. Loretta Malintoppi | USD 98,113.21 |\n| Professor Hi-Taek Shin | USD 78,504.43 |\n| Ms. Adedoyin Oyinkan Rhodes-Vivour | USD 111,449.06 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | USD 94,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | USD 25,365.66 |\n| **Total** | **USD 407,432.36** |\n\n268.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Applicants pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 15(5).268\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a Final Financial Statement of the case fund. The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Applicants.\n\n269.\n\nIn reaching its decision on the allocation of costs, the Committee takes into account the fact that it found that every one of the Applicants' grounds for annulment were without merit and on that basis rejected the Application for Annulment in its entirety. The Committee further notes that, even though the Applicants were granted the stay request, the annulment was ultimately denied, and therefore the Applicants should bear the whole costs and the entirety of the Respondent's legal fees which the Committee finds quite reasonable. In the light of its decision to reject the Application for annulment in its entirety, the Committee also dismisses the Applicants' request for \"all costs of the Applicants in the Arbitration proceedings\" (see paragraphs 72-73 and 257 above).\n\n270.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Respondent in its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder, requested interest on its costs (see paragraphs 75 and 261 above) without specifying whether this should be simple or compound interest, the applicable interest rate, or the start and end dates.\n\n271.\n\nIn instances as this one, where no borrowing rate was established, tribunals have applied conservative measures, in particular USD LIBOR +2%. Since the LIBOR was permanently discontinued on June 30, 2023, the Tribunal finds it reasonable in the circumstances of this case to employ the USD Prime rate to the Respondent's costs.\n\n272.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find it appropriate in this case to award compound interest, particular in light of the fact that it is not sought by either Party.\n\n273.\n\nAs to the date from which interest should accrue, in the absence of any indication from the Respondent, the Tribunal finds that interest should run from the date of this Decision until final payment.\n\n274.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee, in its discretion, grants simple interest at the US Prime rate from the date of this Decision until the date of full payment.\n\n275.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee orders the Applicants to bear all costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses. The Applicants shall also pay USD 382,248.00 to the Respondent to cover the entirety of the Respondent's legal fees and expenses plus interest on all these amounts at the US Prime rate.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n276.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the *ad hoc* Committee unanimously decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Applicants' Application for annulment is rejected in its entirety;\n\n(2) The stay of enforcement of the Award is terminated;\n\n(3) The Applicants shall bear all costs of the annulment proceeding as set out at paragraph 267 above, in the amount of USD 407,432.36; and\n\n(4) The Applicants are ordered to pay the Respondent's legal fees and expenses in the amount of USD 382,248.00 plus interest at the US Prime rate from the date of this Decision to the date of full payment."}]}
