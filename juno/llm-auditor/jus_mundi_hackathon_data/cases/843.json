The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimants are Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil Exploration Company, both of which were incorporated under the laws of Delaware and maintain registered offices at 901 N. Market Street, Suite 705, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, U.S.A.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are represented in this arbitration by Mr. Olasupo Shasore of Ajumogobia & Okeke, 2nd Floor, Sterling Towers, 20 Marina, Lagos, Nigeria; Prof. Oba Nsugbe of Pump Court Chambers, 3 Pump Court, Temple, London, EC4Y 7AJ, U.K.; Ms. Bimpe Nkontchou of Addie & Co., 44 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, London WC2E 7LN, U.K.; and Mr. Bello Salihu, 13A, Sinari Daranijo Street, Victoria Island, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\n**B. The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Federal Republic of Nigeria, with the request for arbitration notified to the Attorney General for the Federation and Minister for Justice, Federal Ministry of Justice, Shehu Shagari Way, Central Area, Abuja, Nigeria.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Aare Afe Babalola, Mr. Adebayo Adenipekun, Mr. Olu Daramola, Mr. Oluwasina Ogungbade, Mr. Kehinde Ogunwumiju, Mr. Ola Faro, and Mrs. Esther Adenipekun, all of Emmanuel Chambers, Emmanuel House, Plot 1 Block 4, CMD/Jubilee Road, Behind Mobil Filling Station, Magodo GRA, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\n**II. OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThis section summarizes the facts of this dispute as found by the Tribunal insofar as they bear relevance to the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimants state that they were incorporated by the Marathon Oil Company of the United States in 1970 in furtherance of investments in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria.1 They subsequently obtained an interest in Pan Ocean, a Nigerian company also incorporated in 1970, as a local vehicle for their investments.2\n\nResponses \u00b6 i; Exh. C-4 \u00b6 2.\n\nResponses \u00b6 i; Exh. C-4 \u00b6 3.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimants state that their investment in Nigeria began with their acquisition of a \"working interest\" in an oil-prospecting license in Nigeria denominated \"OPL 71.\"3 They claim that crude oil was discovered on a field within the territory covered by their prospecting license in 1973.4 According to the Claimants, OPL 71 was transformed into an oil-mining lease denominated \"OML 98,\" and crude oil production began.5\n\nExh. C-4 \u00b63.\n\nResponses \u00b6 i.\n\n*Id.*\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants further claim ownership, through Pan Ocean, of a separate oil prospecting lease denominated \"OPL 275.\"6\n\n*Id..*\n\n9.\n\nIn April 1977, the NNPC was established as the state oil corporation of Nigeria.7 According to the Claimants, the NNPC subsequently entered into an agreement with Pan Ocean in 1979 to obtain an ownership interest in OML 98, and this agreement culminated in the JVA being signed between the NNPC and Pan Ocean in 2002.8\n\n*Id.*\n\nResponses \u00b6 i; *See also* Exh. C-4 \u00b6 5; Exh. R-l 1(1); Exh. R-l 1(1) PLUS.\n\n10.\n\nIn 1995, the NIPC Act was enacted in Nigeria to encourage, promote, and coordinate investments in Nigeria.9 The NIPC Act sets forth substantive protections for qualifying foreign investments as well as mechanisms for the resolution of investment disputes.\n\nExh. RLA-001.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants contend that after 1998, their ownership and control of Pan Ocean were seized illegally. According to the Claimants, the seizure was allegedly made \"with the connivance of the Respondent\u2019s instrumentalities.\"10 Specifically, the Claimants contend that the Minister for Petroleum Resources, the NNPC, the Corporate Affairs Commission and Pan Ocean Managing Director Mr. Festus Fadeyi purported to seize ownership of Pan Ocean from the Claimants.11 The Claimants argue that this behavior amounts to breaches by the Respondent of the NIPC Act and \"international investment law.\"12\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 6.\n\nRfA\u00b616.\n\nRfA \u00b621.\n\n12.\n\nBased on these events, the Claimants claim to have written to the Minister Petroleum Resources of Nigeria through their counsel to declare a dispute and to seek redress on 9 October 2012, 29 October 2012, 21 March 2013, and 3 May 2013.13 The Respondent denies that it received this correspondence.14\n\nRfA, Annexures 1-4.\n\nTr. 87: 9-11.\n\n13.\n\nIn addition to this arbitration, the Claimants assert that they have been engaged in a \"protracted history of court based litigation in Nigeria\" related to this dispute.15\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 47.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe present arbitration is between Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil Exploration Company as the Claimants and the Federal Republic of Nigeria as the Respondent. Their dispute is brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States and the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission Act.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants filed a request for arbitration with ICSID pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention in electronic copy on 31 July 2013 and in hard copy on 5 August 2013. In the RfA, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal render an award:\n\n\"a) Declaring that Respondent has breached its obligations to the Claimants under NIPC A;\n\nb) Directing the Respondent to restore only the nominees of the Claimants as representatives in the 40 % participating interest under the operations of all Joint Venture Agreements and in particular OML 98 and OPL 275;\n\nc) Finding that any purported transfer or acquisition of the 100% interest of the Claimants or any part thereof in 40% of OML 98/OPL 275 or any other asset including its accumulated proceeds howsoever without the consent of the Claimants is an indirect expropriation of its participating interest in the leases;\n\nd) Directing the Respondent, its relevant privies and instrumentalities to pay damages in an amount to be proven at the hearing but which the Claimants presently estimate to be in excess of $500,000,000 (Five Hundred Million United States Dollars);\n\ne) Directing the Respondent, its relevant privies and instrumentalities to pay aggravated damages in the sum of $150,000,000 (One Hundred and Fifty Million United States Dollars) or such amount as may be proven by the Claimants at the hearing ;\n\nf) Restitution of the undiluted 40% participating interest in OML 98 and OPL 275 and all monies accruing thereto, by receiving the proceeds of unjust enrichment controlled in trust for the Claimants to date;\n\ng) Directing that the Claimants be reinstated as the beneficial owner of the 40% participating interest in OML 98;\n\nh) Directing the Respondent to pay the Claimants\u2019 interest and taxes on all sums awarded;\n\ni) Directing the Respondents to pay the Claimants\u2019 costs associated with these proceedings including professional fees and disbursements on a full indemnity basis; and\n\nj) Ordering such further or other relief(s) as the Tribunal deems appropriate in the circumstances.\"\n\n16.\n\nOn 9 September 2013, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the RfA pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n17.\n\nOn 11 November 2013, the Claimants requested that the Arbitral Tribunal in this case be constituted pursuant to the formula provided by Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On 9 December 2013, Professor Julian D. M. Lew, a national of the United Kingdom, accepted his appointment as arbitrator appointed by the Claimants, and Justice Edward Torgbor, a national of the United Kingdom and Ghana, accepted his appointment as arbitrator appointed by the Respondent. On 11 December 2013, Professor William W. Park, a national of the United States and Switzerland, accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal appointed by the Parties. The Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20 was accordingly constituted on 11 December 2013 in accordance with Article 37(2)(b), and the proceedings commenced on that day.\n\n18.\n\nOn 13 February 2014, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first session at the World Bank office in Paris. During that session, the Parties agreed on procedural issues and addressed outstanding issues that are outlined in more detail below.\n\n19.\n\nOn 27 February 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 containing a schedule of submissions on the following preliminary objections raised by the Respondent and set forth in Section 14:\n\n\"14.1.1. Respondent did not consent to submit this dispute to arbitration by ICSID;\n\n14.1.2. Section 26 of the Nigerian Investment Protection Commission Act (\"NIPC\") does not provide a basis for finding consent on the part of Respondent as it merely provides that disputes should be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Rules;\n\n14.1.3. Claimants are not registered with the NIPC and therefore cannot rely on Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act to invoke the jurisdiction of ICSID, and Claimants misled the Secretariat of ICSID to register their Request for Arbitration when they falsely claimed that their enterprise was registered with the NIPC. Pleadings on this objection shall be limited to whether Claimants are registered and the bearing of registration on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction;\n\n14.1.4. Respondent is not a competent party to this arbitration. Claimants\u2019 pleadings on this objection should identify the law and legal authorities on which they intend to rely and the corresponding liability of Respondent;\n\n14.1.5. Claimants\u2019 claims are barred by statute; and\n\n14.1.6. The request is premature in that Claimants failed to explore local remedies/conditions precedent contained in the NIPC Act.\"\n\n20.\n\nOn 14 March 2014, the Respondent filed its Memorial with supporting exhibits and authorities.\n\n21.\n\nOn 11 April 2014, the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial with supporting exhibits and authorities.\n\n22.\n\nOn 25 April 2014, the Respondent filed its Reply with supporting exhibits and authorities.\n\n23.\n\nOn 9 May 2014, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder with supporting exhibits and authorities.\n\n24.\n\nOn 26 June 2014, the Tribunal and the Parties held a hearing on preliminary objections at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London. In attendance at the hearing were the members of the Arbitral Tribunal, ICSID Legal Counsel Mr. James Claxton, and the following party representatives:\n\ni) On behalf of the Claimants:\n\n- Mr. Olasupo Shasore, Ajumogobia & Okeke\n\n- Prof. Oba Nsugbe, Pump Court Chambers\n\n- Mrs. Bimpe Nkontchou, Addie & Co Advisory\n\n- Mr. Bello Salihu, Legal Counsel\n\n- Mr. Jacques Jones, Legal Counsel\n\n- Mr. Richard Evans, Financial Advisor\n\n- Mr. Patrizio Di Guevara Fabbri, Director of Interocean Oil Development Company & Interocean Oil Exploration Company\n\n- Mr. Riccardo Di Guevara Fabbri, Director of Interocean Oil Development Company & Interocean Oil Exploration Company\n\nii) On behalf of the Respondent:\n\n- Mr. Adebayo Adenipekun, Emmanuel House\n\n- Mr. Olu Daramola, Emmanuel House.\n\n- Ms. Ann Biodun Babalola, Emmanuel House\n\n- Mr. Oluwasina Ogungbade, Emmanuel House\n\n- Mr. Kehinde Ogunwumiju, Emmanuel House\n\n- Mr. Ola Faro, Emmanuel House\n\n- Mrs. Esther Adenipekun, Emmanuel House\n\n- Mr. Taiwo Abidogun, Federal Ministry of Justice, Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\n- Mr. Rufai Khalid, NNPC\n\n- Mr. Tijani Alkali Gazali, Federal Ministry of Justice, Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\n25.\n\nProf. Nsugbe and Mr. Shasore presented oral arguments on behalf of the Claimants. Messrs. Adenipekun and Daramola presented oral arguments on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n26.\n\nDuring the morning session, the Parties made submissions on procedural questions. During the afternoon session, the Parties concluded their submissions on procedural questions and made two rounds of pleadings on the preliminary objections, followed by questioning from the Tribunal.\n\n27.\n\nAt the hearing, the President of the Tribunal asked the Claimants if they sought relief on the basis that the Respondent submitted an affidavit of Mr. Taiwo Abidgun concerning the registration of Pan Ocean, which the Claimants claimed was a violation of Section 17.2 of Procedural Order No. 1 in their Rejoinder.16 Section 17.2 provides that \"[n]o witness statements or expert reports will be submitted with the pleadings on the Preliminary Objections.\" The Claimants stated that the matter should be addressed in the proceeding on the merits and did not otherwise request relief.17\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.\n\nTr. 16: 8-20; 26: 8-15.\n\n28.\n\nAt the hearing, the Tribunal requested that the Respondent submit documents related to the requirements for registration under the NIPC Act.18\n\nTr. 48: 18-23.\n\n29.\n\nThe hearing was sound recorded. A verbatim transcript of the hearing on preliminary objections was produced and subsequently distributed to the Parties.\n\n30.\n\nOn 7 July 2014, the Respondent submitted documents related to the requirements for registration under the NIPC Act.\n\n31.\n\nOn 28 July 2014, the Claimants submitted comments on the documents related to the requirements for registration under the NIPC Act produced by the Respondent.\n\n32.\n\nOn 30 July 2014, without instruction from the Tribunal, the Claimants submitted purported proof of delivery for letters filed as exhibits with the RfA as Annexures 1-3.\n\n33.\n\nOn 1 August 2014, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal requesting that it refuse to consider the purported proof of delivery submitted by the Claimants.\n\n34.\n\nOn 2 August 2014, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to comment on the Respondent\u2019s letter of 1 August 2014.\n\n35.\n\nOn 8 August 2014, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal requesting that it disregard the letter of 1 August 2014 and authorize the Claimants to submit additional documents evidencing proof of delivery of the letters.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, the Respondent raised the preliminary objections set forth above.\n\n37.\n\nOn the basis of these arguments, the Respondent invites the Tribunal to:\n\n\"a) Declare that the Claimants\u2019 claim does not fall within the jurisdiction of ICSID or the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nb) Order the Claimants to pay the Respondent all costs reasonably incurred by the latter in connection with these proceedings.\"\n\n**B. The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, the Claimants put forward the following main arguments:\n\n- the Respondent consented to submit this dispute to arbitration by ICSID;\n\n- Section 26 of the NIPC Act provides for arbitration under the ICSID Convention and not merely arbitration in accordance with the \"ICSID Rules\";\n\n- ICSID has jurisdiction over this dispute whether or not Pan Ocean is registered under the NIPC Act, and the Claimants did not intentionally mislead the ICSID Secretariat by claiming that Pan Ocean is registered with the NIPC;\n\n- the Respondent is a competent party to this arbitration;\n\n- the Claimants are competent parties to this arbitration;\n\n- the Claimants did not fail to explore local remedies/conditions precedent contained in the NIPC Act.\n\n39.\n\nOn the basis of these contentions, the Claimants request the Tribunal to:\n\n\"1) declare that it has jurisdiction to decide the present dispute;\n\n2) order the Respondent to pay the costs of this phase of the arbitration, including all expenses that the Claimants have incurred or will incur in respect of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, legal counsel and experts;\n\n3) to set further procedure for the merits phase of this arbitration.\"\n\n**V. KEY PROVISIONS OF TREATY AND STATUTE**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThis section sets out the main legal provisions that bear on the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections.\n\n41.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 25(1) provides:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"\n\n42.\n\nNIPC Act, Section 17 provides:\n\n\"Enterprises eligible for participation\n\nExcept as provided in Section 18 of this Act and subject to this Act, a non-Nigerian may invest and participate in the operation of any enterprise in Nigeria.\"\n\n43.\n\nNIPC Act, Section 20 provides:\n\n\"Registration of enterprise with the Commission\n\n1) An enterprise in which foreign participation is permitted under Section 17 of this Act shall, before commencing business, apply to the Commission for registration.\n\n2) The Commission shall, within fourteen working days from the date of receipt of completed registration forms, register the enterprise if it is satisfied that all relevant documents for registration have been duly completed and submitted or otherwise advise the applicant, accordingly.\"\n\n44.\n\nNIPC Act, Section 26 provides:\n\n\"Dispute settlement procedures\n\n1) Where a dispute arises between an investor and any Government of the Federation in respect of an enterprise, all efforts shall be made through mutual discussion to reach an amicable settlement.\n\n2) Any dispute between an investor and any Government of the Federation in respect of an enterprise to which this Act applies which is not amicably settled through mutual discussions, may be submitted at the option of the aggrieved party to arbitration as follows\u2014\n\n(a) in the case of a Nigerian investor, in accordance with the rules of procedure for arbitration as specified in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act; or\n\n(b) in the case of a foreign investor, within the framework of any bilateral or multilateral agreement on investment protection to which the Federal Government and the country of which the investor is a national are parties; or\n\n(c) in accordance with any other national or international machinery for the settlement of investment disputes agreed on by the parties.\n\n3) Where in respect of any dispute, there is disagreement between the investor and the Federal Government as to the method of dispute settlement to be adopted, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes Rules shall apply.\"\n\n45.\n\nNIPC Act, Section 31\n\n\"In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires [...]\n\n\u2018enterprise\u2019 means an industry, project, undertaking or business to which this Act applies or an expansion of that industry, undertaking, project or business or any part of that industry, undertaking, project or business and, where there is foreign participation, means such an enterprise duly registered with the Commission\"\n\n**VI. TRIBUNAL ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. Overview**\n---------------\n\n**1. Summary Conclusions**\n--------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses the preliminary objections in the order established in Procedural Order No. 1 dated 26 February 2014.\n\n47.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that on occasion the Parties have presented their arguments in different orders and/or formats, sometimes grouping several topics within a single heading. In particular, the Respondent addresses the first objection (lack of consent) chiefly as related to the second objection (the effect of Section 26 of the NIPC Act) and the third objection (registration). Such an approach should not be surprising, given the interaction of these three items.\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal must decline jurisdiction in the event that any of the six objections presented by the Respondent prove justified in the sense of imposing limits on the arbitrators\u2019 authority to decide the case. The Tribunal cannot arrogate authority to decide the case without consent by the Claimants and the Respondent alike.19\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that not all procedural preconditions to arbitration will preclude exercise of arbitral authority. Procedural flaws that may be cured during the arbitration are often characterized by reference to notions such as ripeness, *recevabilit\u00e9* or admissibility, to serve as convenient labels to describe steps taken either before or after constitution of a tribunal which do not *per se* affect jurisdictional competence.\n\n49.\n\nIn some instances a tribunal might find that jurisdictional objections implicate questions which require findings of fact or which are closely intertwined with the substance of the controversy. It would then be appropriate that a determination of the tribunal\u2019s authority be joined to the merits of the case in a separate phase permitting appropriate testimony.\n\n50.\n\nAs summarized below, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that it must reject the Respondent\u2019s objections with the exception of (i) those related to whether the Claimants properly accepted the Respondent\u2019s offer of ICSID arbitration, which is necessary to perfect consent (objection 1), (ii) the registration requirement (objection 3) and (iii) premature filing (objection 6). These three objections will be joined to proceedings on the merits of the controversy.\n\n51.\n\nComplex questions of fact arise from objections with respect to (i) consent, (ii) the registration requirement and (iii) premature filing by reason of failure to enter into NIPC Act provisions on amicable settlement. Each matter remains intertwined with the merits of the controversy requiring further testimony.\n\n**2. Characterization of Preliminary Objections**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent has collapsed a number of the objections which were identified at the first session on 13 February 2014. In part, the Respondent has accorded common treatment of the first three objections in its submissions. Moreover, some of the arguments with respect to consent have been developed under other objections.\n\n53.\n\nFor ease of reference, the Tribunal sets forth below its shorthand references to the six objections which were allowed as preliminary issues:\n\n- Objection 1 : \"Consent\"\n\n- Objection 2 : \"Role of ICSID Rules\"\n\n- Objection 3 : \"Registration\"\n\n- Objection 4 : \"Proper Party\"\n\n- Objection 5 : \"Time Bars\"\n\n- Objection 6 : \"Premature Filing\"\n\n**B. The Six Preliminary Issues**\n---------------------------------\n\n**1. First Objection: Respondent did not consent to submit this dispute to arbitration by ICSID**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. The Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it has not consented to arbitrate this dispute under ICSID auspices. This argument is primarily developed under the objections on the Role of the ICSID Rules, Registration, and the Proper Party, considered below.\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent separately argues that the text of Section 26(2)(b) and (c) of the NIPC Act does not establish its consent to ICSID jurisdiction. It contends that the reference to ICSID in Section 26(3) shows that the general references to \"multilateral agreements on investment protection\" and \"international machinery for the settlement of investment disputes\" in Section 26(2)(b) and (c) were meant to exclude ICSID.20 According to the Respondent, this is because \"it is a settled canon of interpretation that a specific provision in an enactment will take precedence over a general provision.\"21\n\nReply \u00b627 vii.\n\n*Id.*\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that even if both of these provisions could be read to refer to ICSID arbitration, they could not confer jurisdiction over the dispute to ICSID. If this were the case, according to the Respondent, they \"would be considered ambiguous and therefore incapable of conferring jurisdiction on ICSID.\"22 As evidence of the ambiguity, the Respondent refers to the evocation of \"multilateral agreements on investment protection\" and \"international machinery for the settlement of investment disputes\" in Section 26(2).23\n\nReply \u00b6 27 viii.\n\n*Id.*\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants note that consent to ICSID can be conferred in national legislation.24 In this connection, they argue that by Section 26(3) of NIPC Act, the \"Respondent made an irrevocable offer and thereby unilaterally consented\"25 that disputes arising from NIPC Act could be submitted to ICSID. The Claimants further state that, arguably, Section 26(2) also establishes the Respondent\u2019s offer of consent to ICSID jurisdiction in accordance with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.26 The Claimants contend that they accepted Nigeria\u2019s offer to arbitrate under ICSID auspices in the request for arbitration filed in this case, thereby perfecting consent.27\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b619.\n\nRfA \u00b6 7.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 22.\n\nRfA \u00b6 7.\n\nb. Tribunal Conclusion\n----------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe requirements for ICSID jurisdiction are found in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides as follows:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Nigeria\u2019s consent to arbitration is found in Section 26 of the NIPC Act of 1995. As set forth above in greater detail, the legislation provides that any dispute between an investor and any Government of the Federation \"in respect of an enterprise to which this Act applies which is not amicably settled through mutual discussions, may be submitted at the option of the aggrieved party to arbitration [...]\"\n\n60.\n\nSuch legislation further directs that where there is disagreement between the investor and the Federal Government \"as to the method of dispute settlement to be adopted, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes Rules shall apply.\"\n\n61.\n\nAlthough the ICSID Convention requires consent in writing to submit to ICSID arbitration, the Convention contains no special requirements of form.\n\n62.\n\nSection 26(2) is directed in pertinent part to non-Nigerian investors. That provision supplies potential mechanisms for resolution of disputes that have not been resolved amicably as provided for in Section 26(1). However, these provisions require further steps.\n\n63.\n\nIn this case Sections 26(2) and 26(3) of the NIPC Act clearly make a standing written offer to arbitrate to anyone with a claim under the Act.\n\n64.\n\nThis standing offer to arbitrate must be accepted pursuant to its terms, which, to the extent relevant, will be addressed below in connection with the Respondent\u2019s other objections. The Claimants have ***prima facie*** accepted the Respondent\u2019s standing offer by filing their request with ICSID. As discussed further, the Tribunal will need to examine whether this acceptance was tendered in a way which meets all of the conditions in Section 26 of the NIPC Act.\n\n65.\n\nThere is nothing novel about consent to ICSID being granted through national legislation. The nature of the instrument ***per se*** (a national investment statute) poses no obstacle to jurisdiction, as confirmed by a long tradition of persuasive awards in this connection.28\n\n*See,* e.g., *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (Decision on Jurisdiction), ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3 (14 Apr. 1988), \u00b6 60; *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador* (Award), ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26 (2 Aug. 2006), \u00b6\u00b6 212-213; *Zhinvali Development Ltd. v. Republic of Georgia* (Award), ICSID Case No. ARB/00/1 (24 Jan. 2003), \u00b6 339.\n\n66.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, and subject to the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the other objections as set forth below, the Tribunal must reject the contention that the Respondent did not consent to arbitration by reason of the standing offer contained in Section 26 of the NIPC Act.\n\n67.\n\nHowever, this is not the end of the story. The Tribunal must make further inquiries into whether the Claimants accepted that standing offer in a fashion that comports with the terms of the NIPC Act. Consequently, the Tribunal joins to the merits questions related to the adequacy of the Claimants\u2019 acceptance of the standing offer. These questions of adequacy relate principally to objections 3 (Registration) and 6 (Premature Filing), which are discussed below.\n\n**2. Second Objection: Section 26 of the NIPC Act does not provide a basis for finding consent on the part of Respondent as it merely provides that disputes should be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Rules**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. The Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent claims that it did not consent to this proceeding on the basis that the reference to ICSID in Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act is merely the identification of rules to be used should there be arbitration under that section and not an expression of consent to proceedings administered by ICSID.29 According to the Respondent, this is because Section 26(3) refers to the \"ICSID Rules\" and not to the ICSID Convention or to the Centre.30\n\nMemorial \u00b6 53.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 44; 56-59.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the Tribunal should adopt a cautious approach in interpreting Section 26(3) and that the language in Section 26(3) should be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning31 without the word \"ICSID Convention\" read into the provision.32\n\nMemorial \u00b6 49.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 54.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent concedes that some of the ICSID Rules, such as Arbitration Rule 1, make direct reference to the Centre. However, the Respondent contends that these provisions do not act as a bar to proceedings conducted under the ICSID Rules that are not administered by ICSID.33\n\nReply \u00b638.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the term \"investor\" in the phrase \"[w]here a dispute arises between an investor and any Government of the Federation\" in Section 26(1) refers to both foreign investors and Nigerian investors. According to the Respondent, this means that the subsequent reference to ICSID in Section 26(3) could not be a reference to the ICSID Convention because the jurisdiction of the Centre would not extend to proceedings between a Nigerian investor and Nigeria.34\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b639-40.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s argument that Section 26(3) refers only to rules and not to arbitration administered by ICSID. They note that the ICSID Rules are replete with references to the Centre and contemplate the Centre\u2019s involvement in the proceedings.35\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b651.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants also note that the Respondent does not cite any instance of arbitration under the \"ICSID Rules\" not administered by the Centre.36\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 41.\n\nb. Tribunal Conclusion\n----------------------\n\n74.\n\nIt is not plausible, in law or in practice, to read Section 26(3) as merely providing a set of procedural rules to be applied.\n\n75.\n\nAlthough Section 26(3) refers to \"the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes Rules,\" there are no \"ICSID Rules\" of a stand-alone nature. Rather, each of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the ICSID Institution Rules, and the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations govern different stages and aspects of ICSID arbitration proceedings.\n\n76.\n\nThe language of the Convention, Rules and Regulations contemplate administration of arbitral proceedings by the Centre through the active involvement of the Secretary-General of ICSID or the Chairman of the Administrative Council, including the various counsel who form part of the Secretariat. The Arbitration Rules provide ***inter alia*** for the involvement of the Centre in appointing arbitrators, constituting tribunals, fixing time limits, filling vacancies in the tribunal, and receiving correspondence and requests from the parties and arbitrators. Similarly, the Institution Rules, which the Respondent understands to be part of the \"ICSID Rules,\"37 provide that the Centre will receive, evaluate and register requests for arbitration. Both the Arbitration Rules and the Institution Rules refer to provisions of the ICSID Convention. The Convention, Rules and Regulations were evidently drafted to operate together to provide a coherent regime for proceedings administered by ICSID.\n\nReply \u00b6 38.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent does not provide any example of the \"ICSID Rules\" being administered by a non-ICSID institution or ***ad hoc*** tribunal. This is consistent with substance of the Convention, Rules and Regulations as described above.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Section 26(3) is not supported by the text of that Section. Section 26(3) is found in the \"Dispute Settlement Procedures\" part of the NIPC Act, and Section 26(3) is said to be an alternative to the \"method of dispute settlement\" options in Section 26(2). This language suggests that Section 26(3) was meant to provide an alternate method of dispute resolution and not merely to proscribe arbitral rules to be administered ***ad hoc*** or by an unidentified arbitral institution. If the drafters of the NIPC Act had intended to limit Section 26(3) to proscribe rules, the text of Section 26(3) could have said so.\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"you can apply the [ICSID] rules anywhere; it does not have to be before ICSID.\"38 This perspective ignores essential elements of ICSID arbitration, which require intervention of the Secretariat or the Administrative Council. For example, the constitution of the tribunal must be communicated by the Secretary-General under Rule 2(3). On request, the Chairman of the Administrative Council must intervene to constitute the tribunal if the parties fail to make appointments such as to constitute the tribunal in a relatively prompt fashion pursuant to Rule 4. Pursuant to Rule 9, applications to a challenge to an arbitrator must be filed with the Secretary-General.\n\nTr. 74: 8-9.\n\n80.\n\nMoreover, any request for annulment of the award must be made through a writing addressed to the Secretary-General, to be decided by an ***ad hoc*** committee constituted through the actions of the Chairman of the Administrative Council, on grounds set forth in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n81.\n\nIn short, the ICSID Convention, along with its Rules and Regulations, contemplate active administration of arbitral proceedings by the Secretariat and Chairman of the Administrative Council, which will be closely involved in addressing requests from parties on various levels.\n\n82.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects the objection that Section 26 of the NIPC Act does not provide a basis for finding consent on the part of Respondent as it merely provides that disputes should be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Rules.\n\n**3. Third Objection: the Claimants are not registered with the NIPC and therefore cannot rely on Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act to invoke the jurisdiction of ICSID, and the Claimants misled the Secretariat of ICSID to register their Request for Arbitration when they falsely claimed that their enterprise was registered with the NIPC**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. The Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent claims that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over this dispute because the Claimants\u2019 investment vehicle, Pan Ocean, was not registered with the NIPC as required by the NIPC Act. In this connection, the Respondent evokes Sections 20 and 31 of the NIPC Act as the evidence of the obligation to register.39\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.\n\n84.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, these provisions have the effect of limiting consent to arbitration under Section 26 to those enterprises with foreign participation that have been registered with the NIPC.40 The Respondent states that Pan Ocean is not registered with the NIPC and is therefore not \"qualified for protection\" under the NIPC Act.41 In support, the Respondent has submitted ***inter alia*** a copy of a document titled NIPC \"Business Register by Sector\" that purports to list NIPC registered enterprises between 2006 and 2014 and that does not list the Claimants as registered enterprises.42\n\nMemorial \u00b6 71.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 75-76.\n\nExh. R-015.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants bore responsibility for assuring that Pan Ocean was registered because of their ownership of Pan Ocean.43 According to the Respondent, this responsibility arose in 1995 when the NIPC Act was enacted, and even if the Claimants lost control of Pan Ocean in 1998 as they claim, they should have ensured that Pan Ocean was registered in the intervening period between 1995 and 1998.44\n\nReply \u00b6 42.\n\n*Id.*\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Claimants misled the Secretariat of ICSID to register their request for arbitration by falsely claiming that their enterprise was registered with the NIPC.45\n\nMemorial \u00b6 1(c).\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s contention that an enterprise with foreign participation must be registered to benefit from protection under the NIPC Act in all cases. The Claimants contend that the stated purpose of the NIPC Act is to encourage and assist investment in Nigeria and to create a conducive environment for investment law in Nigeria.46 According to the Claimants, these aims would be undermined if foreign investors were denied protections in the NIPC Act simply because they failed to register their \"enterprise.\"\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b621-22.\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimants observe that the definition of \"enterprise\" as being \"duly registered with the Commission\" in Section 31 of the NIPC Act is subject to the qualification \"[i]n this Act, unless the context otherwise requires.\"47 According to the Claimants, the relevant \"context\" in this case is that the Claimants made a \"long-standing,\" significant, successful investment in Nigeria in partnership with the Respondent and that this investment benefitted the Respondent.48 Against this backdrop, they argue that they should not automatically be deprived of the protections of the NIPC Act for the simple reason that the enterprise in which they invested was not registered.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 27 citing Section 31 of the NIPC Act.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b624, 28.\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that Pan Ocean is exempt from the registration requirement because the NIPC Act does not state that enterprises existing before its enactment, which would include Pan Ocean, must be registered.49 The Claimants refer to other investment instruments entered into by Nigeria that contain language providing for retroactive application to suggest that Nigeria would have done the same in the NIPC Act if that was its intention.50 In the alternative, the Claimants contend that the absence of such language presents an ambiguity that should be resolved in favor of foreign investors in light of the stated purpose of the NIPC Act.51\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b625-27.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 26 citing Exh. C-7.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 29.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants argue that by insisting on registration, the Respondent is relying on an artificial technicality. According to the Claimants, Pan Ocean complied \"in every way with any reasonable categorization of an investment.\"52 The Claimants add that the Respondent, though operating as a joint-venture partner with Pan Ocean, has not insisted that Pan Ocean be registered even though the Respondent\u2019s own instrumentality \"possesses and controls the register.\"53 In these circumstances, the Claimants question what registration could possibly have added given that all of the other jurisdictional requirements under the NIPC Act have been met.54\n\nRejoinder \u00b630.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b632-33.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 31.\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants challenge the reliability of the NIPC \"Business Register by Sector\" filed by the Respondent for various reasons. According to the Claimants, the document is notably inconsistent with the requirements of the NIPC Act because it is not limited to enterprises with foreign participation55 and because there is an 11 year-gap of time between the enactment of the NIPC Act and the first entry on the list.56\n\nC-Register \u00b615.\n\nC-Register \u00b6 9.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the Respondent should be estopped from rescinding its offer to arbitrate with investors at ICSID because of its collaboration with those who control Pan Ocean and its failure to complain to Claimants about the alleged lack of registration in the past.57\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimants add that the Respondent\u2019s failure to provide specific information about registration criteria and procedure undermines its case.58 The Claimants contend that in any event they do not have control of Pan Ocean. Furthermore, the Claimants assert that Respondent is aware of this fact and that the Claimants cannot register Pan Ocean under NIPC Act.\n\nRejoinder \u00b637.\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimants argue that although the NIPC Act does not contain a guarantee of fair and equitable treatment to investors, the Respondent is nevertheless bound to extend fair and equitable treatment to investors under international law.59\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that this seems to imply that the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the registration requirement in the NIPC Act is a violation of the alleged obligation of \"fair and equitable treatment.\"\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they did not seek to mislead the Secretariat by stating that Pan Ocean had been registered with the NIPC. They state that their request for proof of registration from the NIPC went unanswered and that they \"genuinely believed that Pan Ocean would have registered its undertaking with the Commission.\"60\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\n96.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over this case because Pan Ocean was not registered. Alternatively, the Claimants argue that the issue of registration is linked to the merits of the case and should not be decided \"without a full factual determination of the merits.\"61\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 40.\n\nb. Tribunal Conclusion\n----------------------\n\n97.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal has attempted to disaggregate arguments made with respect to two different questions related to registration. The first concerns the need for registration in order to do business in Nigeria. The second pertains to the role registration plays as a predicate to arbitral jurisdiction pursuant to Section 26 of the NIPC Act.\n\n98.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is concerned only with the second matter, registration as a precondition to arbitral authority. The question is whether the arbitration provisions of the NIPC Act may be triggered by persons who have not been \"duly registered with the Commission\" as that phrase has been used in Section 31 of the NIPC Act.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Section 26 of the NIPC Act allows for arbitration \"in respect of an enterprise to which this Act applies.\"\n\n100.\n\nMoreover, Section 31 of the NIPC Act defines \"enterprise\" to include a variety of business undertakings and \"where there is foreign participation, means such an enterprise duly registered with the Commission.\"\n\n101.\n\nHowever, the Parties\u2019 arguments raise serious issues that cannot be resolved as a preliminary matter. Lingering questions of fact and law require further elaboration with respect to the definition of \"enterprise,\" applicability of the registration requirements to entities existing before enactment of the NIPC Act, and the reliability of the NIPC business register. Moreover, it will be necessary to consider the Claimants\u2019 assertion that they were unable to register Pan Ocean by reason of being outside the management. Furthermore, the Tribunal must consider arguments of estoppel related to the alleged lack of complaint by the Respondent during cooperation with Claimants.\n\n102.\n\nThe following maters remain intertwined with the merits of the case such that they must be considered during the merits phase of the proceeding:\n\n\u2022 The definition of \"enterprise\";\n\n\u2022 Applicability of the registration requirement to entities existing before enactment of the NIPC Act;\n\n\u2022 Reliability of the NIPC business register filed by the Respondent;\n\n\u2022 The Claimants inability to register Pan Ocean, such inability allegedly deriving in part from the Respondent\u2019s actions, as well as the fact that the Claimants are outside the management of the company; and\n\n\u2022 Estoppel based on the Respondent\u2019s alleged lack of complaint about registration during prior cooperation with the Claimants.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider these matters as they bear on its decision as to whether registration is required as a precondition to the Tribunal\u2019s authority to hear and to adjudicate the Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n104.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal joins the issue of Pan Ocean\u2019s registration to the merits phase of the case.\n\n**4. Fourth Objection: the Respondent is not a competent party to this arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. The Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over this dispute because the Claimants have named the wrong respondent.\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondent claims that it has designated the NNPC as \"the competent agency/subdivision that is subject to the jurisdiction of ICSID\" since 11 May 1978.62 According to the Respondent, the NNPC is the governmental agency responsible for oil exploration in Nigeria.63 The Respondent notes that the NNPC has legal personality that is distinct from that of the Respondent.64 The Respondent also observes that the NNPC, and not the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is the counter-party to the JVA that is at issue in this proceeding.65 In these circumstances, the Respondent argues that the Republic of Nigeria is not a \"proper party to these proceedings\" and thus infers that if there had been a proper respondent, it could only have been the NNPC.66\n\nMemorial \u00b6 96.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 95.\n\nMemorial \u00b6102.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 88.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 113.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in developing this argument the Respondent includes a separate but related set of contentions to the effect that the dispute settlement provisions of the NIPC Act cannot be invoked because the Tribunal is faced with a contractual dispute arising under the JVA.\n\n108.\n\nThe Respondent states that the dispute resolution provision in Section 14 of the JVA provides for ***ad hoc*** arbitration in Lagos, Nigeria and does not provide for ICSID arbitration.67 According to the Respondent, the general dispute settlement provision of the NIPC Act is \"overridden\" by the dispute resolution provision in Section 14 of the JVA.68\n\nExh. RLA-11(1).\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 104-108.\n\n109.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction extends to the Federal Republic of Nigeria. They note that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides for jurisdiction over ICSID Contracting States, such as Nigeria, and that Nigeria\u2019s designation of the NNPC as an agency opens up the possibility of naming the NNPC as a respondent in ICSID proceedings but does not exclude jurisdiction over Nigeria.69\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b655.\n\n110.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the dispute resolution provision in the JVA overrides the dispute settlement provision of the NIPC Act, the Claimants argue that their claims are not based on breaches of the JVA but rather are based on the NIPC Act and international law.70\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 60.\n\nb. Tribunal Conclusion\n----------------------\n\n111.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that the existence of contractual claims under the JVA does not preclude the Claimants from filing a separate set of claims pursuant to international law, which would be subject to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to Section 26 of the NIPC Act. The substantive claims in this arbitration are not for breach of the JVA ***per se.***\n\n112.\n\nThese contract claims clearly do not fall within the adjudicatory authority of the Tribunal except to the extent that they might form part of the factual matrix to be considered in relation to the Claimants\u2019 arguments about violation of international law.\n\n113.\n\nThe Claimants have chosen to file their grievances against the government of Nigeria, alleging that the government conspired to seize ownership and control of Pan Ocean from the Claimants.\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimants may, or may not, be able to prove their allegations. In any event, however, it is not the prerogative of either the Respondent or the Tribunal to tell them how to plead their case. If it turns out that the complained-of conspiracy was not engaged in by the Respondent, then the Claimants will have been found to have filed unfounded claims.\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that plain language of Section 26 limits arbitration claims to those resulting from disputes \"between an investor and any Government of the Federation.\"71 The Claimants claim to have been harmed by actions of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. They have accordingly commenced this arbitration against the Federal Republic of Nigeria under the dispute settlement provisions of the NIPC Act, enacted by the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nIt may be that the evidence shows that NNPC was a mere instrumentality of the government of Nigeria. Such a finding will have to be alleged and proved during the rest of the arbitration.\n\n116.\n\nThe Respondent states that the NNPC was designated by the Federal Republic of Nigeria as the government agency responsible for oil exploration. Be that as it may, Nigeria remains an ICSID Contracting State for the purposes of jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n117.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects the objection that the Respondent is not a competent party to this arbitration.\n\n**5. Fifth Objection: Claimants\u2019 claims are barred by statute**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. The Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claims because they were not filed within the time limit legally permitted.72 The Respondent argues that Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which authorizes tribunals to apply the law of the Contracting State party to a dispute where the parties have not agreed on the applicable law, leads to the application of the law of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in this case.73\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 141-142.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 146-147.\n\n119.\n\nSection 7 of the Limitation Act of Nigeria enumerates actions that are barred after six years. The Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 claims are covered by this provision.74 Further, the Respondent argues that the cause of action for this arbitration arose about eleven years ago. In support, it cites a letter from the Claimants to the Nigerian Minister of Petroleum Resources of 9 October 2012 in which they complain of being excluded from management of Pan Ocean for about ten years.75 The Respondent also contends that the Claimants initiated court proceedings against Mr. Festus Fadeyi in the Federal High Court of Nigeria in 2002.76 According to the Respondent, this shows that more than six years passed from the time the cause of action arose to the time the RfA was filed in this case and that, as a result, the claims are time barred.77\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 149-150; 151.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 155; Annexure 2 to the RfA.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 155(2) citing RfA \u00b6 15.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 157.\n\n120.\n\nThe Claimants argue that there is no legal basis for the Respondent\u2019s objection because there is no limitation period in either the NIPC Act or in the ICSID Convention.78 The Claimants also argue that there is a difference between a claim for breach of contract and a claim brought under international law principles relating to expropriation.79\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 46; In this connect, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have relied on *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4) for this point.\n\nTr. 116: 15-17.\n\n121.\n\nIn this connection, the Claimants contend that they actively pursued their rights in the Nigerian courts and that this shows that they pursued their legal rights in good time.80 The Claimants also argue that under international law the Respondent should be prevented from relying on its national laws to avoid its international obligations.81\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 47.\n\n*Id.*\n\nb. Tribunal Conclusion\n----------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent has presented no evidence of any statute of limitations imposed on arbitration claims for violations of the provisions of the international law claims presented to the Tribunal in relation to its alleged jurisdiction under Section 26 of the NIPC Act.\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal has found nothing in the NIPC Act which indicates the time frame for bringing a claim for breach of that Act.82 Rather, the limits under Nigerian law which have been drawn to the Tribunal\u2019s attention address court actions related to contract claims or claims against the government.\n\nThe Respondent seems to accept that the NIPC Act contains no specific directions in this connection. Tr. 101: 23.\n\n124.\n\nAlthough limits under Nigerian law exist with respect to court actions related to contract claims and court actions against the government, none proves relevant to this arbitration, which relates to violation of international law. By their nature, the Claimants\u2019 requests sound in expropriation of property, alleging that the government conspired with Mr. Fadeyi to wrest control of Pan Ocean from its rightful owners.\n\n125.\n\nOf course, no tribunal would look positively on a claim filed after the Claimants had waited unduly, sitting on its rights for an inordinate amount of time. Statutes of \"limitation\" and of \"repose,\" which cut off certain legal rights if they are not acted on by a certain deadline, are common to many legal systems.\n\n126.\n\nIn this instance, however, the Claimants were anything but \"in repose\" about their rights. The Respondent does not deny that the Claimants attempted to rectify the perceived wrongs by litigation.\n\n127.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds no bar to hearing the claims based on any applicable statute of limitations.\n\n128.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s objection that the Claimants\u2019 claims are barred by statute.\n\n**6. Sixth Objection: The request is premature in that the Claimants failed to explore local remedies/conditions precedent contained in the NIPC Act**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. The Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimants did not comply with the preconditions to arbitration in Section 26 of the NIPC Act.\n\n130.\n\nFirstly, the Respondent argues that the Claimants did not notify the Respondent of the existence of a dispute as required by Section 26.83 In this connection, the Respondent denies receiving letters from the Claimants\u2019 counsel to the Minister of Petroleum Resources of Nigeria declaring the existence of a dispute and seeking redress.84 The Respondent urges the Tribunal to reject tracking reports purportedly evidencing delivery because those documents were not filed in good time, and the Claimants did not seek leave to introduce them into evidence.85 The Respondent also argues that there is no evidence that the Minister of Petroleum Resources received the letters, that the Claimants have not evidenced that the recipients identified in the tracking reports were officials of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, and that there is no record of the tracking reports on the websites of the corresponding courier companies.86 The Respondent equally rejects the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Respondent refused to meet with the Claimants\u2019 representatives about the dispute in 2004.87\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 122-123.\n\nTr. 87: 9-11.\n\nLetter from the Respondent to the Tribunal received on 1 August 2014 responding to the Claimants\u2019 correspondence to the Tribunal received on 30 July 2014.\n\n*Id.*\n\nReply \u00b6 70.\n\n131.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent argues that in addition to the notification requirement, Section 26 imposes a separate requirement that there be a disagreement between the parties as to the method of dispute resolution. According to the Respondent, there was no such disagreement in this case.88\n\nMemorial \u00b6 123.\n\n132.\n\nThirdly, the Respondent argues that the Claimants made no attempt to amicably settle the dispute with the Respondent as required by Section 26(1) of the NIPC Act.89\n\nMemorial \u00b6 124.\n\n133.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, each of these failures prevents the Claimants from commencing arbitration in accordance with Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act.\n\n134.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they have fully complied with the requirements under Section 26 and were within their rights to commence this arbitration. Concerning the Respondent\u2019s knowledge of the dispute and amicable settlement, they contend that as early as 2004 representatives of their interests scheduled a meeting with an advisor to then President of Nigeria to seek a settlement of the dispute. According to the Claimants, the Presidential advisor subsequently refused to meet with the Claimants\u2019 representatives after they traveled from Geneva to Abuja for the meeting.90\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 63.\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimants state that they notified the Respondent of the dispute orally and in writing on numerous occasions. They refer to four letters from the Claimants\u2019 counsel to the Nigerian Minister of Petroleum Resources that were exhibited with the RfA as evidence.91 To evidence that these letters were received by the Respondent, the Claimants seek to rely on tracking reports from the associated courier companies. In response to the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the tracking reports were not filed in good time and are unreliable, the Claimants argue that the reports are formal documents that speak for themselves and will assist the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.92 They add that they are prepared to submit invoices issued by the courier companies for delivering the letters93 as well as evidence refuting the Respondent\u2019s argument that there is no record of the tracking reports on the websites of the courier companies.94\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 64; Annexures 1-4 to the RfA.\n\nC-Tracking \u00b6\u00b65-11.\n\nC-Tracking \u00b614.\n\nC-Tracking \u00b6\u00b612-13.\n\nb. Tribunal Conclusion\n----------------------\n\n136.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent\u2019s objections to premature filing of the claims often lump together failure to explore local remedies in the strict sense (as related to national court proceedings) with the absence of any genuine amicable settlement attempts.\n\n137.\n\nThe dispute settlement procedures in Section 26 of the NIPC Act mention amicable settlement in two provisions. First, Section 26(1) stipulates that where a dispute arises, \"all efforts shall be made through mutual discussion to reach an amicable settlement.\" Second, Section 26(2) provides that any dispute between an investor and any Government of the Federation \"in respect of an enterprise to which this Act applies which is not amicably settled through mutual discussions, may be submitted at the option of the aggrieved party to arbitration [...]\"\n\n138.\n\nThe reading of the provisions pressed by the Respondent would have the amicable settlement efforts treated as a precondition to arbitration.\n\n139.\n\nSetting aside the Parties\u2019 respective assertions of fact concerning efforts to resolve the dispute amicably (addressed in greater detail below), the Tribunal notes that the language of Section 26 does not easily lend itself to interpretation as a jurisdictional precondition. Section 26(1) provides that \"all efforts shall be made through mutual discussion to reach an amicable settlement\" but does not contain the formulation common to preconditions such as a specific injunction along the lines that an investor may file a claim only after six months have elapsed following failure to resolve the dispute through amicable settlement.\n\n140.\n\nJust as significantly, Section 26(2) does not make attempts at amicable settlement a precondition to arbitration but rather provides that disputes that have not been amicably settled may be submitted to arbitration.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal need not, and in the absence of evidence cannot, decide this matter right now, given that the Parties differ on what attempts were in fact made to resolve the dispute amicably. The Claimants contend that they sought to resolve amicably the dispute both orally and in writing. The Respondent rejects these contentions. The Claimants respond that their attempts to reach amicable settlement are evidenced by four unanswered letters and by the fact that representatives of the Respondent refused to attend a scheduled meeting to discuss settlement in Abuja. The Respondent says that the letters were not received and that there is no evidence of any such meeting to discuss settlement.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided to join this matter to the next stage of the arbitration to enable the Parties to submit their evidence. Accordingly, in their submissions on the merits, the Parties are invited to address the circumstances related to allegations that the Claimants\u2019 letters went unanswered and the meeting in Abuja was met with a refusal by Respondent, as well as how these circumstances bear on the amicable settlement provisions in the NIPC Act.\n\n143.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because there was no disagreement about the method of dispute settlement. The Tribunal invites the Parties to comment further on this argument in the submission on the merits if they wish.\n\n144.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal observes that there is no justification for placing an obligation on the Claimants to exhaust local remedies before commencing arbitration. This is not a precondition to arbitration in either the ICSID Convention or the dispute resolution clause at Section 26 of the NIPC Act. Although some investment instruments contain such a requirement, the NIPC Act does not.\n\n145.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal joins to the merits of this case the issue of whether \"the request is premature in that the Claimants failed to explore local remedies/conditions precedent contained in the NIPC Act\" as formulated by the Respondent.\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that the Parties disagree about the admissibility of tracking documents submitted on 30 July 2014, and that the Claimants have offered to produce invoices related to delivery of correspondence. The Tribunal will consider these matters further at the hearing on merits as well as the three jurisdiction arguments that have been joined to the merits.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n147.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that:\n\n- Objection 1 (Consent) is rejected insofar as it calls into question whether Section 26 of the NIPC Act constitutes a standing offer to arbitrate. The Tribunal finds that Section 26 does indeed constitute such a standing offer. However, questions related to the adequacy of the Claimants\u2019 acceptance of that offer are joined to the merits;\n\n- Objections 2 (Role of the ICSID Rules), 4 (Proper Party) and 5 (Time Bars) are rejected; and\n\n- Objections 3 (Registration) and 6 (Premature Filing) are joined to the merits.\n\n148.\n\nCosts are reserved for a later decision.\n\n149.\n\nSubsequently the Tribunal will invite the Parties to confer on directions for further proceedings."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2017-02-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 2 to 4 August 2016, the Tribunal held an evidentiary hearing in London.\n\n2.\n\nOn 4 August 2016, the Respondent submitted an \"*application to the Tribunal to issue an order for provisional measures against Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil Exploration Company (the \"Claimants\")*\" (the \"**Application**\"). The provisional measures sought by the Respondent consist in an order that the Claimants \"*post security for the Respondent's costs in this arbitration*.\"1\n\nRespondent's Application, para. 1.\n\n3.\n\nOn 5 August 2016, the Claimants submitted their Response to the Respondent's Application (the \"**Response**\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 14 October 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 (\"**PO5**\"), which contained its ruling on the Claimant's requests regarding the authority of Volterra Fietta lawyers to represent the Respondent and the source and terms of the funding of the Respondent's defence. The Tribunal's ruling read as follows:\n\n*a) The Respondent shall supply a letter from the Attorney General confirming that the Volterra Fietta law firm and Ms. Rameau are validly appearing in these proceedings on behalf of the Respondent.*\n\n*b) Assuming confirmation that the Volterra Fietta firm is appearing on behalf of the Respondent, the Attorney General shall confirm whether or not that engagement is at no cost to the Federal Republic of Nigeria.*\n\n*c) The Attorney General shall disclose the persons (whether or not qualifying as third party financial institutions in the narrow sense) who are underwriting the expenses of the legal teams in this arbitration, and who are paying the fees and expenses of the members of the legal team. The disclosure shall cover any person ultimately responsible for covering fees and out-of-pocket costs (including deposits with ICSID) of (i) the firm of Afe Babalola & Co, (ii) the firm of Volterra Fietta and/or (iii) Ms. Rameau. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal expects disclosure in regard to any individual, entity, organisation association, government, or person of any sort, providing monies to undertake Respondent's defense, even if serving as a conduit for funding from another source, either directly or indirectly.*\n\n*d) For the sake of good order and parity, the Claimants shall confirm, in a letter issued jointly by both corporations (Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil Exploration Company) the identity of any persons (whether or not qualifying as third party financial institutions in the narrow sense) who are underwriting the expenses of the Claimants' legal team in this arbitration, and who are paying the fees and expenses of the members of the legal team. The disclosure shall cover any person ultimately responsible for covering fees and out-of-pocket costs (including deposits with ICSID) of Mr. Olasupo Shasore and his firm Ajumogobia & Okeke, as well as for Professor Oba Nsugbe, Ms. Bimpe Nkontchou, and Mr. Bello Salihu. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal expects disclosure in regard to any individual, entity, organisation association, government, or person of any sort, providing monies to support Claimants' representation, even if serving as a conduit for funding from another source, either directly or indirectly.*\n\n*e) All disclosures directed by this order shall be made a*[nd] *delivered to ICSID and the other party by no later than fourteen (14) days from the present ruling.*\n\n5.\n\nBy letter dated 27 October 2016, the Attorney-General of the Respondent (the \"**A-G**\") provided information in response to the Tribunal's ruling in PO5. The A-G stated:\n\n*[...] to date, the Respondent has not paid any money for fees and out of pocket costs in these proceedings.*\n\n*[...]. In the context of the long-standing relationship, Are Afe Babalola, SAN, and his firm Afe Babalola & Co offered their services to the Respondent in relation to this present proceedings at no cost for the Respondent.*\n\n*[...]Are Afe Babalola of Afe Babalola & Co has also engaged the firm of Volterra Fietta and Ms Rameau at no cost to the Respondent.*\n\n*[...] The Respondent wishes to further state that Volterra Fietta and Ms Rameau are part of the legal team of the Respondent at no costs to the Respondent.*2\n\nLetter of the Attorney-General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria dated 27 October 2016.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 29 October 2016, Mr. Are Afe Babalola sought, with reference to the A-G's letter of 27 October 2016, to further comply with the Tribunal's directive in PO5. This letter read, in relevant parts, as follows:\n\n*[...] As confirmed in the letter of the Attorney General of 27th October, 2016 my firm's representation of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in these proceedings is at absolutely no cost to the Government. This is in keeping with my well established practice of offering such services to the government on pro bono basis.*\n\n*[...] My decision was also actuated by the knowledge that whatever I may expend in putting up a defence might eventually be recoverable should cost be eventually awarded against the Claimants following the failure of its claims.*\n\n*[...] I have as a result of the above been responsible for all expenses incurred in the defence of the Respondent in these proceedings including the expenses of the law [sic] of Volterra Fietta and Ms Rose Rameau.3*\n\nLetter of Mr. Are Aafe Babalola dated 29 October 2016.\n\n**II. Positions of the Parties**\n--------------------------------\n\nA. **The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent relies on ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1) and Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and requests an order for the preservation of its rights.4 The Respondent submits that \"*there is a serious risk of irreparable harm*\" because the Claimants \"*have no means to pay for the costs of this arbitration and all of their costs are being paid for by a third party funder that has a direct financial stake in the outcome of this arbitration and whose counsel is both a witness in the present case and counsel to a number of the entities or individuals who have a beneficial interest in the Claimants*.\"5\n\nApplication, para. 2.\n\nApplication, para. 3.\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants' impecuniosity and inability to comply with a potential adverse costs order was established by the testimony of their own witness, Mr. Jacques Jones, who testified at the hearing that \"*the Claimants are penniless companies*.\"6\n\n*Id.,* citing Mr. Jacques Jones, Hearing Transcript (uncorrected), Day 2, page 64, line 23.\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent further underscores the fact, also revealed by Mr. Jones at the hearing, that the Claimants' claims are funded by a third party - Sigmoil Resources NV - and that Mr Jones himself, as counsel to Sigmoil Resources NV, gave opinions as to the strategy and tactics to pursue in the arbitration.7\n\nApplication, paras. 4-6.\n\n10.\n\nFor the Respondent, these facts establish that \"*the real economic beneficiary [...] is funding this arbitration and [...] will not be susceptible to paying any costs order made against the Claimants*.\"8, which \"*places the Respondent in a highly vulnerable position in which it is at serious risk of irreparable harm*\"9, since \"*the Respondent would have no recourse to seek payment of any costs order against the Claimants*.\"10\n\nApplication, para. 7.\n\nApplication, para. 8.\n\nApplication, para. 9.\n\n11.\n\nRelying on the tribunal's decision in *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, which considered it \"*unjustified to burden the Respondent with the risk emanating from the uncertainty as to whether or not the unknown third party will be willing to comply with a potential costs award in Respondent's favor*\"11, the Respondent contends that:\n\n*It is obvious that Sigmoil Resources would not willingly pay any costs order made against the Claimants. It would be unreasonable to burden the Respondent with that risk.*12\n\n*RSM Production Corporation v. Saint Lucia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10), Decision on Saint Lucia's Request for Security for Costs of 13 August 2014 (\"***RSM v. Saint Lucia***\"), para. 83.\n\nApplication, paras. 10-11.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent adds that \"[a]*n order for security for costs is the only means of ensuring that the Respondent's rights are preserved*\" and that \"[w]*ithout that security, there is a virtual certainty that the Respondent will suffer irreparable harm, in the event that costs are ordered against the Claimants*.\"13 For the Respondent, there are no risk of prejudice to the Claimants because \"*it is evident that Sigmoil Resources has the necessary financial wherewithal to post security for costs*.\"14\n\nApplication, para. 12.\n\nApplication, para. 13.\n\n13.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimants to post security for the Respondent's costs for a sum of no less than US$8 million.15\n\nApplication, para. 14.\n\nB. **The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Mr. Jones voluntarily disclosed at the hearing on 3 August 2016 that Sigmoil Resources NV was funding their claims in this arbitration, and that they never sought to hide this fact.16 The Claimants further submit that they have also disclosed the terms of the funding arrangement.17\n\nResponse, para. 3.\n\nResponse, para. 5.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the mere existence of a third party funding arrangement is not sufficient justification for the grant of an order for security for costs.18 In that respect, the Claimants allege that the decision of the Tribunal in the *RSM v. Saint Lucia* case is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case: the Claimants first note that the *Saint Lucia* tribunal affirmed the position of ICSID tribunals that provisional measures \"*should only be granted in exceptional circumstances*19\"; the Claimants then submit that the Respondent has not established that the circumstances that prompted the *Saint Lucia* tribunal to grant provisional measures exist in this case, including that relating to the Claimants' history of not complying with arbitral awards.20 The Claimants, citing the decision in the *EuroGas* decision,21 note that they have not defaulted on their payment obligations in this case and that \"*financial difficulties and third-party funding - which has become a common practice - do not necessarily constitute per se exceptional circumstances justifying that the Respondent be granted an order of security for costs*.\"22\n\nResponse, para. 5.\n\nResponse, para. 6.\n\nResponse, para. 6.\n\n*EuroGas Inc and Belmont Resources Inc v Slovak Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/14), Decision on the Parties' Requests for Provisional Measures of 23 June 2015 (\"***EuroGas v. Slovakia***\").\n\nResponse, para. 9, citing *EuroGas*, para. 123.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants further assert that the role of Mr. Jones in establishing the Claimants' strategy in this arbitration does not constitute sufficient grounds to justify an order for provisional measures.23\n\nResponse, para. 7.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimants finally note that the Respondent itself has acknowledged that \"*Sigmoil clearly has the resources to pay for a security for costs order*\" and that the Respondent's alleged risk of suffering an irreparable harm is unjustified.24\n\nResponse, para. 11.\n\n18.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing arguments, the Claimants request that the Tribunal dismiss the Respondent's request for provisional measures.25\n\nResponse, para. 12.\n\n**III. Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\nA. **Legal Framework**\n----------------------\n\n19.\n\nICSID tribunals derive their authority with respect to provisional measures from Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39.\n\n20.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.*\n\n21.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 39 provides that:\n\n*At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.*\n\n22.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and Rules also contain specific provisions regarding the issue of costs. First, Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention states that:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the Award.*\n\n23.\n\nSecond, ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1) provides:\n\n*The Award shall be in writing and shall contain:*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*(j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.*\n\n24.\n\nThird, Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) provides:\n\n*(d) in connection with.every arbitration proceeding unless a different division is provided for in the Arbitration Rules or is decided by the parties or the Tribunal, each party shall pay one half of each advance or supplemental charge, without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of an arbitration proceeding to be made by the Tribunal pursuant to Article 61(2) of the Convention [...].*\n\n25.\n\nFinally, it has been accepted by a number of tribunals that an order to post security for costs falls within the provisional measures within a tribunal's competence, even though the measure is not expressly mentioned in the ICSID Convention and Rules.26 The Tribunal agrees with that approach. The fact that security for costs is not mentioned in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention or in ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 cannot exclude a tribunal's power or jurisdiction in that regard. These provisions do not list any specific type of provisional measure, but refer broadly to \"*any provisional measures*.\" If tribunals could only order measures that are specifically listed in these provisions, they could not order any provisional measures.\n\nSee e.g. *RSM v. Saint Lucia,* paras. 51-57, and the decisions cited therein.\n\nB. **The Requirements for Provisional Measures**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nProvisional measures are \"*extraordinary measures*\", and as such should be recommended in limited circumstances.27 An order for provisional measures requires the existence of a right that needs to be preserved, and the necessity to urgently avoid imminent and irreparable harm.28\n\n*Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Procedural Order No. 2 of 28 October 1999 (\"***Maffezini v. Spain***\"), para. 10. See also *Saipem S.p.A. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7), Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, para. 175; *Burimi S.R.L. and Eagle Games SH.A. v. Republic of Albania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18), Procedural Order No. 2 of 3 May 2012 (\"***Burimi v. Albania***\"), para. 34; *EuroGas v. Slovakia*, para. 121.\n\nSee e.g., *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Decision on Provisional Measures of 17 August 2007 (\"***Occidental v. Ecuador***\"), para. 59; *Perenco Ecuador Ltd v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6), Decision on Provisional Measures of 8 May 2009 (\"***Perenco v. Ecuador***\"), para. 43; *Burlington Resources Inc. and others v. Republic of Ecuador and Petr\u00f3leos del Empresa Estatal del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Procedural Order No. 1 of 29 June 2009 (\"***Burlington v. Ecuador***\"), para. 51; *Burimi v. Albania*, para. 34.\n\n27.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, provisional measures must aim at protecting or preserving a party's right or interest that either actually exists, or will (or is at least likely to) materialize, and is susceptible of being harmed.\n\n28.\n\nThe right to be preserved can be either a substantive right, such as the right to reparation for a breach of contract or international wrongful act, or a procedural right, such as the right to ensure the integrity of the proceeding or the right to obtain reimbursement of costs.29\n\n*RSM v. Saint Lucia*, paras. 65-71.\n\n29.\n\nThe question of whether provisional measures can only relate to existing rights or also to conditional or future rights has also been addressed in previous decisions.30 For reasons specific to this case and discussed below,31 the Tribunal does not need to address extensively the question here. It is sufficient to mention that an order for provisional measures requires that, at the very least, the right to be preserved is able to materialize at some point.\n\n*RSM v. Saint Lucia*, paras. 72-73, and the decisions referred to therein. See also *Maffezini v. Spain*, paras. 11-21; *Valle Verde Sociedad Financiera S.I. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ARB/12/18), Procedural Order. No. 8 of 21 September 2016, paras. 20-22.\n\nSee paras. 35 to 37 below.\n\n30.\n\nTribunals assess the appropriateness of provisional measures by weighing the interests of both parties. If the harm threatening the applicant exceeds greatly the potential cost or detriment to the party affected by the measure, the measure can be considered necessary.32 As a corollary, the harm must exist and be imminent.33 Potential or hypothetical harm cannot, therefore, justify an order for provisional measure.34\n\n*City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21) Decision on Provisional Measures of 19 November 2007, para.72. See also *Burlington v. Ecuador*, para. 82; *Occidental v. Ecuador*, para.93; *Burimi v. Albania*, para. 35.\n\n*Occidental v. Ecuador*, para. 89. See also *Burimi v. Albania*, para. 35.\n\n*Id.*\n\n31.\n\nUrgency exists when the adjudication of the issue underlying the measure requested cannot wait the outcome of the awards on the merits.35\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador*, para. 73. See also *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22), Procedural Order No. 1 of 31 March 2006, para. 76.\n\n32.\n\nThe burden of proving that these requirements have been met falls upon the party requesting the provisional measures.36\n\n*Maffezini v. Spain*, para. 10. See also *Burimi v. Albania*, para. 37.\n\nC. **The Respondent's Request**\n-------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the measures requested by the Respondent are not justified under the present circumstances. The Tribunal is indeed not convinced that the Respondent has a right that is at risk of imminent and irreparable harm and which, as a consequence, would need to be urgently preserved.\n\n*a. The existence of a right to be preserved*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent contends that:\n\n*[...] an immediate order is appropriate requiring the Claimants to post security for the Respondent's costs in this arbitration. This arbitration was initiated in July 2013. The costs are already significant. An order for security for costs is the only means of ensuring that the Respondent's rights are preserved. Without that security, there is a virtual certainty that the Respondent will suffer irreparable harm, in the event that costs are ordered against the Claimants.*37\n\nApplication, para. 12.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it has a right to recover costs in this arbitration should the Tribunal decide to allocate costs against the Claimants, and that this right will be irreparably impaired if security for costs is not posted by the Claimants.\n\n36.\n\nIn this connection, the Respondent has also confirmed that the defence by Nigeria's counsel of the Claimants' claims was done \"at no costs\" for the Respondent, and that its counsel has \"*been responsible for all expenses incurred in the defence of the Respondent in these proceedings including the expenses of the law [sic] of Volterra Fietta and Ms Rose Rameau*.\"38\n\nLetter of Mr. Are Aafe Babalola dated 29 October 2016.\n\n37.\n\nGiven that the Respondent is represented and advised in this proceeding at no costs, then the Respondent - on the basis of the facts and evidence currently before the Tribunal -cannot claim, at this stage of the proceeding, to have costs to recover. As a consequence, the Respondent cannot claim to have a right to recover costs that would need to be preserved by the ordering of a provisional measure.\n\n38.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal considered it necessary to draw a distinction between a right that may already exist at the time the measure is sought and a right that cannot exist at the time the measure is sought. This is because provisional measures require that the relevant right be capable of being preserved, and as a matter of logic one can only preserve what already exists, will exist or has at least a chance or possibility to exist. In the present circumstances, the *pro bono* arrangement in place between the Respondent and its counsel makes it impossible, at the time the provisional measure is sought, for a right to recover costs to arise, since there are no costs for the Respondent.\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal's determination is based on the facts and evidence presented to it and could perhaps have been different if the *pro bono* arrangement described to the Tribunal provided that the Respondent would pay its counsel costs and expenses in case a costs order is ordered in its favour.\n\n40.\n\nFurther, in this case, the Respondent has no commitments or obligations in respect of the payment of the costs incurred in this Arbitration. This has been made clear by the Attorney General and Mr Are Afe Babalola in their correspondence quoted above (paragraphs 4-5). Accordingly, if Respondent is successful in this Arbitration it will not have any costs to seek to recover. The Tribunal has noted that Mr Are Afe Babalola states that \"*if the Respondent Government is successful in this Arbitration whatever I may expend in putting up a defence might eventually be recoverable should costs be eventually awarded against the Claimants following the failure of its claims* \".39 Mr. Are Afe Babalola is not a party to this Arbitration and has no right to recover costs. He has undertaken to represent the Respondent at \"*no cost to Respondent*\"; whether it wins or loses there is no cost to the Respondent. Accordingly, Mr. Are Afe Babalola cannot recover his costs/his law firm's costs, nor can those incurred by other law firms and lawyers representing the Respondent in this Arbitration as they are not party to this Arbitration.\n\nLetter of Mr. Are Aafe Babalola dated 29 October 2016.\n\n41.\n\nShould a change in the fee arrangement in place between the Respondent and its counsel be implemented and evidenced, the Tribunal cannot exclude the existence of a right to be preserved. This is a matter to be addressed if and when the situation changes.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal is conscious of the fact that some pro bono arrangements accord different treatment to legal fees on the one hand and out-of-pocket arbitration costs and expenses on the other. For instance, under some arrangements legal advice and representation are provided at no costs but administrative fees advanced by counsel as well as expenses incurred in relation to the representation are invoiced to and paid by the party. Under such arrangements, a right to recover administrative costs and expenses might arguably exist. However, the Respondent has not contended that an arrangement of this kind was in place. To the contrary, the Respondent's A-G indicates in its letter dated 27 October 2016 that \"*to date, the Respondent has not paid any money for fees and out of pocket costs in these proceedings*.\"40 Moreover, the amount of the security requested by the Respondent, USD 8 million,41 which the Respondent has not detailed or justified, strongly suggests that the measure requested aims at securing the entirety of any costs (though without any basis of calculation of such costs) rather than just expenses.\n\nLetter of the Attorney-General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria dated 27 October 2016.\n\nApplication, para. 14.\n\n43.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal considers that the provisional measures requested are not justified and must be rejected.\n\n*b. Necessity and urgency*\n--------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal considers these two requirements for good order. While necessity and urgency are normally the points of focus of tribunals' analyses when deciding provisional measures, the confirmation by the Respondent that it has not incurred and will not incur costs renders such an analysis moot.\n\n*i. The necessity of the provisional measure*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe measure requested is not necessary because there is no evidence of an imminent and irreparable harm threatening the Respondent's alleged right.\n\n46.\n\nThe fact that the Claimants are \"*penniless companies*\" funded by a third-party to pursue this arbitration is not evidence of their future unwillingness and/or inability to honor a costs award rendered against them. In other words, and as stated by the tribunal in the *Burimi* case, \"[t]*he Tribunal is unwilling to find imminent danger of harm based on the Respondent's speculation about the Claimants' future conduct*.\"42\n\n*Burimi v. Albania*, para. 39.\n\n47.\n\nAs indicated above, provisional measures are exceptional in nature, and therefore require exceptional circumstances. The Tribunal shares the views of the tribunal in the *Eurogas* case, which decided that \"*financial difficulties and third-party funding [...] do not necessarily constitute per se exceptional circumstances justifying that the Respondent be granted an order for security for costs.*\"43\n\n*EuroGas v. Slovakia*, para. 123.\n\n48.\n\nOrdering the Claimants to post security for costs in the present circumstances would impose on them an additional financial requirement, not provided for in the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, for their case to proceed.44 The Claimants have met, so far, the financial requirements prescribed by ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and the Tribunal sees no convincing reason to consider that the harm allegedly faced by the Respondent greatly exceeds the damage that would be caused to the Claimants by the provisional measure.\n\n*Burimi v. Albania*, para. 41.\n\n49.\n\nFor this reason, the Tribunal considers that the provisional measures requested by the Respondent are not justified.\n\n*ii. The urgency of the provisional measure*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nBy its own admission, the Respondent has not incurred any legal costs or expenses in these proceedings.45 Beside the speculative nature of the Respondent's contention regarding the Claimants' future conduct vis-a-vis a potential costs order, the fact that no costs have been incurred to date by the Respondent, nor are any expected to be incurred in the future, suffices to disprove that the provisional measure requested is justified by urgency. In the Tribunal's view, it cannot, indeed, be urgent for the Respondent to secure at this stage of the proceeding a right to recover costs that it has not spent.\n\nSee para. 37 above, and Letter of the Attorney-General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria dated 27 October 2016.\n\n51.\n\nFor the above-elaborated reasons, the Tribunal considers that the provisional measures requested by the Respondent are not justified.\n\n**IV. Decision**\n----------------\n\n52.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has failed to establish that the provisional measures requested are justified in the present circumstances.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent's Application for provisional measures.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 31, 2013, Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil Exploration Company **(\"Interocean\"** or the **\"Claimants\")** submitted a Request for Arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** against the Federal Republic of Nigeria **(\"Nigeria\"** or the **\"Respondent\").**\n\n2.\n\nOn September 9, 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States **(\"ICSID Convention\"),** under ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20.\n\n3.\n\nOn December 11, 2013, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings **(\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"****).** Mr. James Claxton, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. Mr. Claxton was subsequently replaced by Mr. Benjamin Garel, ICSID Legal Counsel.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Professor William W. Park, a national of Switzerland and the United States of America, President, appointed by the Parties in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention; Professor Julian Lew, a national of the United Kingdom, appointed by the Claimants; and Judge Edward Torgbor, a national of the United Kingdom and Ghana, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n5.\n\nOn February 13, 2014, the Tribunal held its first session with the Parties. During the first session, the Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that they had no objection to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nIn accordance with Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1, issued on February 26, 2014, the Respondent filed a Memorial on Preliminary Objections on March 14, 2014. On April 11, 2014, the Claimants filed a Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections. On April 25, 2014, the Respondent filed a Reply on Preliminary Objections. On May 9, 2014, the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections.\n\n7.\n\nOn June 26, 2014, the Tribunal held a Hearing on Preliminary Objections in London. They subsequently issued a Decision on Preliminary Objections on October 29, 2014, (the **\"Decision on Jurisdiction\").**\n\n8.\n\nOn February 17, 2016 and April 20, 2016, the Tribunal issued, respectively, Procedural Order No. 3 and Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the production of documents.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal held the first Hearing on the Merits from August 2 through August 4, 2016, in order to hear the Parties\u2019 fact witnesses as well as their damages and legal experts (the **\"August 2016 Hearing\").**\n\n10.\n\nShortly before and at the outset of the hearing, the Claimants made two applications to the Tribunal: (a) challenging the validity of the appointment of Volterra Fietta & Co. and Ms. Rosemary Rameau as Respondent\u2019s co-counsel and (b) seeking the disclosure by the Respondent of any agreement providing for the funding of its defense by a third party.\n\n11.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Respondent also requested provisional measures from the Tribunal, seeking an order that the Claimants post security for its costs in the arbitration.\n\n12.\n\nAs a result of the time spent by the Parties and the Tribunal on these applications and request, only the fact witnesses were heard at the hearing. The examination of damages and legal experts was postponed to a second hearing, which was subsequently scheduled to be held on July 19 through July 21, 2017 (the **\"July 2017 Hearing\").**\n\n13.\n\nOn 15 October 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 concerning the applications made by the Claimants before and at the August 2016 Hearing.\n\n14.\n\nOn February 1, 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 concerning the request for provisional measures filed by the Respondent at the August 2016 Hearing.\n\n15.\n\nOn June 19, 2017, the Claimants filed two applications seeking leave to introduce additional documents into the record. The first application concerned a number of emails, which the Parties and the Secretariat had received from an unknown source on June 11, 2017 (the **\"June 11, 2017 Emails\").** The second application concerned a letter from the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission dated September 26, 2016 (the **\"NIPC Letter\").**\n\n16.\n\nOn June 30, 2017, the Respondent filed its responses to the Claimants\u2019 applications of June 19, 2017.\n\n17.\n\nBy email dated July 7, 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the question of the introduction of the NIPC Letter into the record by the Claimants would be addressed as necessary at the opening of the July 2017 Hearing scheduled on July 19-21, 2017. The Tribunal further indicated that the question of the admission of the June 11, 2017 Emails would be discussed on the third day of the July 2017 Hearing.\n\n18.\n\nOn the first day of the July 2017 Hearing, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to admit the NIPC Letter into the record. The Tribunal then heard the Parties\u2019 legal and damages experts. At the end of the hearing, the Tribunal, after consulting the Parties, issued two directives: one regarding the filing of post-hearing briefs, and the other regarding the Claimants\u2019 request to introduce the June 11, 2017 Emails into the record.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of August 4, 2017, the Respondent notified ICSID of its intention to submit a proposal for the disqualification of all three members of the Tribunal by no later than August 18, 2017.\n\n20.\n\nOn August 16, 2017, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of all three members of the Tribunal (the **\"Challenged Arbitrators\")** in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (the **\"Proposal\").** On that date, the Centre informed the Parties that the proceeding had been suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Centre also established a procedural calendar for the Parties\u2019 submissions on the Proposal.\n\n21.\n\nOn September 4, 2017, the Claimants filed their observations on the Proposal.\n\n22.\n\nOn September 11, 2017, each of the three Challenged Arbitrators furnished his explanations regarding the Proposal.1\n\nThe Challenged Arbitrators\u2019 explanations dated September 11, 2017 are appended to this Decision as Annexes A (Prof. Park), B (Prof. Lew) and C (Judge Torgbor)\n\n23.\n\nOn September 18, 2017, each Party submitted further observations on the Proposal.\n\n**II. PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Disqualification Proposal**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s arguments in support of its Proposal were set forth in its submissions of August 16, 2017 and September 18, 2017. These arguments fall within four grounds, which relate either to the entire Tribunal or to certain members of the Tribunal. They are summarized below.\n\n**1) Ground 1: The Tribunal\u2019s Comments Touching on the Integrity of the Respondent\u2019s Counsel**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent states that the July 2017 Hearing schedule only provided for expert conferencing with the damages experts and that on the second day before the lunch break, at the end of the Respondent\u2019s legal experts\u2019 examination, the President of the Tribunal indicated that the Tribunal would also like to conduct expert conferencing with the legal experts at the end of that day.2\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal, p. 4.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent further states that the Tribunal authorized one of its counsel, Mr. Adenipekun, to confer with its legal expert Mr. Ayoola, while he was still on the stand, regarding his availability to participate in an expert conferencing session at the end of that day. The Respondent adds that Mr. Ayoola indicated that he was not available.3\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal, pp. 4-5.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with three sets of comments made by the President of the Tribunal, later that day and on the third hearing day, in connection with these events.\n\n28.\n\nThe first comments, made after the mid-afternoon break on the second hearing day, were as follows:\n\n*Secondly, the Tribunal was\u2014and we'll be very honest with you. The Tribunal was distressed that the Respondent\u2019s legal expert had to leave town so quickly because we would have wanted to have the opportunity to put Respondent\u2019s legal expert and Claimants\u2019 legal expert, at least Mr. Oditah and Mr. Ayoola together for further questioning, and now it seems like that is no longer a prospect, and we are trying to figure out what we will do about it. We would have liked to have been able to encourage Mr. Ayoola to remain. There were conversations with him that we weren't privy to, so we don't know what was said.4*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal, pp. 6-7; Tr. Day 2, 699:1-14.\n\n29.\n\nThe second comments, made at the beginning of the third hearing day on July 21, 2017, were as follows:\n\n*The Tribunal will take this all on board at the break Just to summarize, though, although it is correct that the Tribunal did not make any finding of fault as to why the conferencing of the Legal Experts could not take place, we were disappointed that it did not take place. We noticed that there were conversations between Respondent\u2019s counsel and Mr. Ayoola immediately after his testimony when we suggested that there be witness conferencing. We don't know what the content of those conversations was, so we can't comment. But there is a sense on the part of the Tribunal that it is unsatisfactory that there was no opportunity for the Legal Experts, or at least some of them, to sit together the way the Quantum Experts did. And when the Quantum Experts sat together, we had a great deal of fruitful exchange. We were deprived of that fruitful exchange with the Legal Experts.* (emphasis supplied by the Respondent)5\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal, pp. 7-9; Tr. Day 3, 902:15 - 903:10.\n\n30.\n\nThe third comments, made shortly after the second comments, were as follows:\n\n*Yes. As I said, the Tribunal was not a party to that conversation. We make no conclusion about it. We have not allocated fault in this matter, but we do express our disappointment because we would have liked to have seen Justice Ayoola and Professor Oditah, in particular, together because they were two experts who differed sharply on the analysis of Nigerian law.* (emphasis supplied by the Respondent)6\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal, pp. 9-12; Tr. Day 3, 904:15-22.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal\u2019s comments create an appearance of bias because they were repeated several times and they used strong language such as \"distressed\", \"unsatisfactory\" and \"disappointed\".7 The Respondent also contends that the Tribunal repeated that it was not part of the conversation between Mr. Adenipekun and the expert, whereas the conversation took place in the hearing room, in front of the Tribunal who could and did ask questions to Mr. Ayoola. The Respondent adds that the Tribunal could have tried to convince and encourage the expert to stay, but did not.8\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal, pp. 9-10\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal, pp. 9-10.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Tribunal\u2019s comments imputed bad faith to Mr. Adenipekun and, evaluated objectively by a third party, suggested not only that the conversation he had with the expert influenced Mr. Ayoola to indicate that he was not available for the expert conferencing session, but also that the Tribunal doubted the accuracy of Mr. Adenipekun\u2019s report of such conversation.9\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 6.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the Tribunal\u2019s reference to its lack of knowledge of the contents of Mr. Adenipekun\u2019s conversation with the expert was not necessary to express its regrets not to be able to have a conferencing session with the legal experts. For the Respondent, the Tribunal\u2019s repeated comments *\"were actuated by a belief or perception that its lead counsel lacks integrity \",* which, relying on the Chairman\u2019s decision in *Burlington Resources, Inc* v. *Republic of Ecuador,* is evidence of the Tribunal\u2019s lack of impartiality.10\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal pp.12-13.\n\n**2) Ground 2: Professor Park Failed to Disclose His Involvement as Arbitrator in a Related Arbitration**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Professor Park failed to disclose that he was acting as arbitrator in an arbitration between TOTAL Exploration & Production Nigeria Ltd., Chevron Petroleum Nigeria Ltd., Nexen Petroleum Nigeria Ltd., and Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria (Offshore East) Ltd. as claimants and the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (the **\"NNPC\")** as respondent **(\"the TOTAL et al v. NNPC Arbitration),** in which an award was rendered on December 13, 2013, three days after Professor Park had accepted his appointment in the present ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20.11\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal pp. 12-14.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent submits that because the issues decided in the TOTAL et al v. NNPC Arbitration are similar to, related to and overlap with the issues in ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20, and because the NNPC was identified in the Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration as one of the *\"principal contact points and instrumentalities concerned with this matter\",* Professor Park should have disclosed his involvement in that case immediately upon his appointment in ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20.12\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 14.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent adds that even if Professor Park did not know enough about the issues in ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20 at the time of his appointment, his duty to disclose is a continuous one and he should have made the required disclosure once the issues became clear.13\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 15.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that Professor Park\u2019s involvement in the TOTAL et al v. NNPC Arbitration as well as his failure to disclose it raise reasonable doubts as to his impartiality.14\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 15.\n\n**3) Ground 3: Professor Park\u2019s and Professor Lew\u2019s Failure to Disclose Their Membership in a Task Force on Third Party Funding**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that in 2014, after the commencement of this arbitration, the International Council for Commercial Arbitration (ICCA) and Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) jointly created a Task Force on Third-Party Funding. Professor Lew and Professor Park are members of this task force, the latter as co-chair. The Respondent also mentions that Professor Fidelis Oditah, one of the Claimants\u2019 legal experts, is also a member of this task force.15\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 15.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent further recalls that the stated mission of the Task Force is to study and make recommendations regarding the procedure, ethics, and policy issues relating to third party funding in international arbitration.16\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal pp. 15-16.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that the issue of third party funding in this case only arose after the creation of the task force, at the time of the August 2016 Hearing, and was adjudicated by the Tribunal in its Procedural Order No. 5. The Respondent adds that it complied with Procedural Order No. 5 by providing a letter from its Attorney-General dated October 27, 2016 explaining how its defense was funded. The Respondent further adds that the Tribunal\u2019s concern with the potential existence of a third-party funder was to be able to check and avoid any potential conflict of interests.17\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal pp. 16-18.\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the June 11, 2017 Emails which the Claimants sought to introduce into the record have reopened the third party funding issue and placed it at the center of the case. The Respondent also submits that these Emails aim to prove that the funding of its defense is not as explained in the Attorney-General\u2019s letter of October 27, 2016, but rather, that the individual accused by the Claimants of having orchestrated the expropriation of its investment is providing funds to the Respondent.18\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 18.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Tribunal\u2019s decision to admit these documents into the record was greatly influenced by the fact that two of its members are members of the ICCA/QMUL task force on third party funding. The Respondent also notes that none of the Tribunal\u2019s members has indicated that a conflict would arise if that individual was in fact funding the Respondent\u2019s defense, yet the Tribunal still decided to admit the June 11, 2017 Emails.19\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 18.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent therefore concludes that because Professor Park and Professor Lew are members of the task force on third party funding, they cannot be relied upon as impartial and independent arbitrators with respect to the central issue of third party funding in this case.20\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal pp. 18-20.\n\n**4) Ground 4: The Tribunal\u2019s Numerous Procedural Irregularities, Considered Together, Indicate That it is Biased Against the Respondent**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent contends that from the beginning of the case until the July 2017 Hearing, the Tribunal *\"embarked on a consistent trend of fundamental procedural irregularities\",* which considered together indicate that the Tribunal is biased against the Respondent.21 These alleged irregularities are summarized below.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 19.\n\n**Procedural Irregularities Allegedly Committed Before the July 2017 Hearing**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) The Tribunal refused to consider and determine in its Decision on Jurisdiction dated October 29, 2014 that the Claimants were not registered with the NIPC and deferred such determination to a later stage of the proceedings. The Respondent recalls that the jurisdiction of ICSID in this case is subject to the registration of the Claimants with the NIPC. The Respondent further recalls that the Claimants had affirmed in their Request for Arbitration dated July 30, 2013 that they were registered with the NIPC but later admitted in their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated May 19, 2014 that they were not registered with the NIPC. For the Respondent, the Tribunal ostensibly gave an unfair advantage and opportunity to the Claimants to remedy the non-registration issue.22\n\n(ii) During the hearing on jurisdiction on June 26, 2014, the Tribunal raised an issue regarding the comprehensiveness of the NIPC\u2019s register while being aware of the Claimants\u2019 admission in their Rejoinder that they were not registered with the NIPC. The Respondent contends that the issue raised by the Tribunal was irrelevant and that the Tribunal raised it only to discredit the NIPC register and minimize the importance of the Claimants\u2019 non-registration with the NIPC.23\n\n(iii) The Tribunal never inquired into nor sanctioned the fact that the Claimants filed submissions after the deadline established by the Tribunal on multiple occasions, without requesting nor obtaining an extension of time. The Respondent contends that *\"the Tribunal would go at any length to help the Claimants in the conduct of their case.\"24*\n\n(iv) In Procedural Order No. 4 the Tribunal granted the Claimants\u2019 further requests for the production of documents whereas (a) the production of these documents had already been denied by the Tribunal in its Procedural Order No. 3; (b)the Tribunal in its Procedural Orders Nos. 1 and 2 had scheduled only one round of document production requests; and (iii) the second production of documents ordered by the Tribunal significantly reduced the Respondent\u2019s time to prepare its Reply and to prepare for the August 2016 Hearing on the merits, thereby impairing the Respondent\u2019s right to a fair hearing. For the Respondent, any reasonable bystander would agree that by issuing Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal was inclined to go to any length to accommodate the Claimants\u2019 unjustified requests to the detriment of the Respondent.25\n\n(v) The Tribunal requested that the Attorney-General of the Respondent confirm in writing that some of the Respondent\u2019s counsel were duly authorized to represent the Respondent in this arbitration, despite receiving such confirmation orally from the Respondent' Solicitor-General at the August 2016 hearing and receiving a copy of the Nigerian law authorizing the Solicitor-General to exercise the duties and functions of the Attorney-General in his absence. The Respondent contends that in doing so, the Tribunal *\"went against the time-honoured principle that the only person who can question the appearance of counsel in a matter is the person who the counsel claims to represent. \"26*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal pp. 19-20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal pp. 20-21.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal, pp. 21-22.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal, p. 22.\n\n**Procedural Irregularities Allegedly Committed During the July 2017 Hearing Expert Conferencing**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(vi) According to the Respondent, the Tribunal belatedly raised the possibility of conducting expert conferencing of the Parties\u2019 legal experts for the sole purpose of assisting the Claimants to remedy their case. The Respondent relies in that respect (i) on the intensity with which the Tribunal sought to conduct expert conferencing with the legal experts, (ii) on the disappointment expressed over the inability to conduct such expert conferencing session, and (iii) on the Claimants\u2019 inexplicable readiness to participate in the proposed expert conferencing session.27\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal, pp. 22-23.\n\n*Admission into the Record of the June 11, 2017 Emails and the NIPC Letter*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(vii) At the July 2017 Hearing, the Tribunal granted the Claimants\u2019 request to introduce new documents into the record without any factual or legal basis to do so, while both Parties agreed that these documents did not emanate from them. The Respondent submits that the documents were admitted in disregard of the applicable law and procedure simply because the Claimants have placed reliance on them.28\n\n(viii) The Tribunal directed the Respondent to file a response to the Claimants\u2019 application to admit the June 11, 2017 Emails into the record, which it did on June 30, 2017. The Respondent notes that in its response it argued that the June 11, 2017 Emails were covered by privilege.29\n\n(ix) The Tribunal also directed the Respondent to file a response to the Respondent\u2019s second application dated June 19, 2017 seeking to introduce into the record the NIPC Letter, which it did on June 30, 2017.30\n\n(x) The Tribunal subsequently informed the Parties that it would hear them on the admissibility of the NIPC Letter and of the June 11, 2017 Emails during the July 2017 Hearing.31\n\n(xi) The Tribunal did not hear the Parties on the admission of the NIPC Letter in the morning of the first July 2017 Hearing day.32\n\n(xii) The Tribunal did hear the Parties on the admission of the June 11, 2017 Emails on the third day of the July 2017 Hearing.33\n\n(xiii) On the third day of the July 2017 Hearing, when announcing the Tribunal\u2019s decision to provisionally admit the June 11, 2017 Emails into the record, the President of the Tribunal remarked that the Respondent had raised the issue of privilege for the first time that day. The Respondent submits that the issue of privilege had been raised in its written submissions and that the President\u2019s remark indicates that the Tribunal members did not read these submissions.34\n\n(xiv) The Tribunal adopted two different approaches with respect to the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 new documents: for the NIPC Letter, the Tribunal admitted it at the outset of the hearing, without hearing the Parties; for the June 11, 2017 Emails, the Tribunal left it to the end of the hearing to hear and consider the Parties\u2019 oral arguments and to determine the issue. The Respondent submits that the approach used for the NIPC Letter made it available to the Claimants for the rest of the hearing, including during the cross-examination of one of the Respondent\u2019s legal experts. By contrast, the approach used for the June 11, 2017 Emails prevented the Respondent from referring to them not only to address the question of third-party funding, but also to refute the Claimants\u2019 allegations made on the basis of these emails concerning the merits of the case.35\n\n(xv) By provisionally admitting the June 11, 2017 Emails and thereby getting an opportunity to look at them, the Tribunal made a case for the Claimants that even they did not make.36\n\n(xvi) By provisionally admitting the June 11, 2017 Emails, the Tribunal also circumvented the important procedural requirement that the Claimants must establish the existence of \"exceptional circumstances\" under paragraph 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1.37\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal pp. 23-24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 26.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 26-27.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Proposal p. 28.\n\n**B. The Claimants\u2019 Reply**\n---------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 arguments opposing the Respondent\u2019s Proposal were set forth in its submissions of September 4 and September 18, 2017. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n**1) Ground 1: The Tribunal\u2019s Comments Touching on the Integrity of the Respondent\u2019s Counsel**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal merely expressed its disappointment at the unavailability of the Respondent\u2019s legal experts to participate in an expert conferencing session, and that the Tribunal did not apportion any blame for it.38 They do not accept that the Tribunal\u2019s expression of disappointment had the connotation urged by the Respondent.39\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 8.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 9.\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimants also note that the schedule for the July 2017 Hearing allotted a time for expert conferencing and did not expressly state which of the experts would participate in the conference.40 The Claimants add that its experts were available in case they would be needed for the expert conferencing session.41 For the Claimants, a reasonable third party would consider expert conferencing useful to assist a tribunal in better understanding the issues in dispute and would not find it unreasonable for a tribunal to express its disappointment that an expert is unavailable to participate in a expert conferencing session.42\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 10.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 11.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 11.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Chairman\u2019s rulings in the *Burlington* v. *Ecuador* and *Blue Bank* v. *Venezuela* cases are inapposite43 They also oppose the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Tribunal\u2019s remarks would lead an objective third party to conclude there was a lack of impartiality or independence on the Tribunal\u2019s part44\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 12.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 13.\n\n**2) Ground 2: Professor Park\u2019s Involvement as Arbitrator in a Related Arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants recall that under Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9, the Respondent must establish that Professor Park manifestly lacks independence and impartiality and must do so promptly45 The Claimants contend in that respect that the mere appearance of partiality or bias is not sufficient46\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 14-18.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 21.\n\n50.\n\nReferring to the unchallenged arbitrators\u2019 decision in the *Suez* v. *Argentina* cases, the Claimants submit that the Proposal only relies on the facts that Professor Park was an arbitrator in the TOTAL et al v. NNPC Arbitration and that he did not disclose such involvement. The Claimants note that the Proposal does not establish why this fact impairs Professor Park\u2019s independence and impartiality. The Claimants recall that in the *Suez* v. *Argentina* decision, the unchallenged arbitrators had decided that:\n\n*A finding of an arbitrator\u2019s or a judge\u2019s lack of impartiality requires far stronger evidence than that such arbitrator participated in a unanimous decision with two other arbitrators in a case in which a party in that case is currently a party in a case now being heard by that arbitrator or judge. To hold otherwise would have serious negative consequences for any adjudicatory system.47*\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA.* v. *Argentine Republic* and *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and J'ivendi Universal SA.* v. *The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Cases Nos. ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/19), Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal (October 22, 2007) **(\"Suez\"),** para. 36.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that the Proposal relating to Prof. Park must fail in the same manner it failed in the *Suez* v. *Argentina* case, because it is based on the Respondent\u2019s subjective belief and therefore does not meet the objective third-party standard required by Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.48\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 23.\n\n52.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants submit that the Proposal was not filed promptly as required by Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. The Claimants indeed contend that as NNPC is the Nigerian State-owned oil company responsible for 90% of the Respondent\u2019s revenue, the Respondent must have been aware of commercial arbitration proceedings initiated against its national oil company. The Claimants add that the Respondent necessarily knew of and approved the appointment of Professor Park as president of the tribunal in the TOTAL et al v. NNPC Arbitration, and therefore it knew of such appointment on December 1, 2013, when it proposed the appointment of Professor Park as President of the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20. The Claimants conclude that the Respondent became aware of the ground for disqualification at the latest on December 13, 2013 when the TOTAL et al v. NNPC award was issued and that the proposal for disqualification was filed over three years and seven months thereafter.49\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 58-64.\n\n**3) Ground 3: Professor Park\u2019s and Professor Lew\u2019s Membership in a Task Force on Third Party Funding**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimants note that while Professor Fidelis Oditah is also a member of the task force, as recalled by the Respondent, he has not given any evidence on the issue of third-party funding.50\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 25.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimants then submit that the Respondent has not provided any evidence establishing Professor Park\u2019s and Professor Lew\u2019s manifest lack of impartiality and independence, other than merely indicating that they are members of the same task force as Professor Oditah.51\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 25.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that the Respondent has not met the legal standard required by Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention.52\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 25.\n\n56.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants submit that the Proposal was not filed promptly as required under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. The Claimants argue that the membership of Professor Park and Professor Lew on the task force on third party funding had been public knowledge since 2014, two years before the third party funding issue arose in this case and three years before the Respondent filed its proposal.53\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 65-67\n\n**4) Ground 4: The Tribunal\u2019s Numerous Procedural Irregularities Before and During the July 2017 Hearing**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants address each of the procedural irregularities allegedly committed by the Tribunal as follows.\n\n**Procedural Irregularities Allegedly Committed Before the July 2017 Hearing**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) The Claimants submit that the reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s decision to defer its determination of the Respondent\u2019s objection based on the Claimants\u2019 registration with the NIPC are clearly explained in its Decision on Jurisdiction. In the Claimants\u2019 view, they are consistent with Procedural Order No. 1 on the submission of preliminary objections.54 The Claimants contend that the Respondent has distorted the Tribunal\u2019s reasons and that the Tribunal did not grant the Claimants\u2019 an unfair advantage. The Claimants further submit that the Respondent has not provided any objective evidence to establish a manifest lack of impartiality and independence on the part of the Tribunal.55 In addition, the Claimants assert that the proposal to disqualify the Tribunal on this ground was not filed promptly, as it was filed almost three years after the Decision on Jurisdiction.56\n\n(ii) The Claimants submit that the Claimants\u2019 registration with the NIPC and the reliability of the NIPC register are both relevant issues in this case. The Claimants add that the Respondent confuses two issues: the registration of the Claimants themselves and the registration of their investment vehicle.57 For the Claimants, the Respondent did not provide any evidence to establish the Tribunal\u2019s manifest lack of impartiality and independence, and an objective third party evaluating the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into the NIPC register would not conclude that the Tribunal is biased against the Respondent.58 In addition, the Claimants contend that the proposal to disqualify the Tribunal on this ground was not filed promptly, as it was filed over three years after the Tribunal raised the issue of the NIPC register.59\n\n(iii) The Claimants submit that they filed their memorials with minimal delay, which did not cause any prejudice to the Respondent. They add that the Respondent has not established that the Tribunal\u2019s failure to sanction these minimally late filings was motivated by the wish to help the Claimants in the conduct of their case. The Claimants contend that the Respondent too has responded late to a Tribunal\u2019s request on at least one occasion, and that they have never thought of suggesting that the Tribunal\u2019s failure to sanction the Respondent\u2019s delay was indicative of bias on the Tribunal\u2019s part.60 The Claimants further allege that the Respondent has also benefited from an overly generous extension of time granted by the Tribunal, over the Claimants\u2019 objections, when it retained a new counsel shortly before the filing of its first memorial. The Claimants consider that while the Respondent ought to have retained co-counsel much earlier than it did, the granting of the extension does not establish procedural unfairness or bias by the Tribunal. The Claimants conclude that the Respondent has not established a manifest lack of independence and impartiality on the Tribunal\u2019s part as required by Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.61 In addition, the Claimants contend that the proposal to disqualify the Tribunal on this ground was not filed promptly.62\n\n(iv) The Claimants contend that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning for each of the document production requests it granted was balanced and that the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Tribunal *\"was prepared to go to any lengths to accommodate the whims and caprices of the Claimants even to the detriment of the Respondent\"* is unfounded. The Claimants also submit that the Respondent is dissatisfied with the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Procedural Order. No. 4 but has not furnished any evidence to indicate a manifest lack of impartiality and independence on the part of the Tribunal. The Claimants argue that the mere existence of an adverse ruling is insufficient to prove a manifest lack of impartiality as required by Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention.63 In addition, the Claimants contend that the proposal to disqualify the Tribunal on this ground was not filed promptly, as it was filed over a year after the Tribunal ordered the second round of document production.64\n\n(v) The Claimants submit that the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Procedural Order No. 5 to request a written confirmation of Volterra Fietta\u2019s representation from the Attorney-General was justified because the first written confirmation from the Attorney-General submitted voluntarily at the August 2016 Hearing did not mention the Volterra Fietta law firm by name.65 The Claimants further contend that the Respondent has not provided evidence to establish the Tribunal\u2019s manifest lack of impartiality and independence.66 In addition, the Claimants contend that the proposal to disqualify the Tribunal on this ground was not filed promptly, as it was filed over a year after the Claimants challenged the appearance of Volterra Fietta and Mrs. Rameau as Respondent\u2019s counsel.67\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 29-30.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 31.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 68-70.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 32.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 33.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 68-70.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 34.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 35-36; Claimants\u2019 Further Observations, paras. 6-7.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 68-70.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 37-40.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 68-70.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 41-43.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 44.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 68-70.\n\n**Procedural Irregularities Allegedly Committed During the July 2017 Hearing Expert conferencing**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Tribunal\u2019s proposal to hold a conferencing session with the legal experts was designed to directly confront the experts\u2019 diametrically opposed legal positions, not to grant an advantage to the Claimants.68 The Claimants note that the Tribunal could not presume to know in advance whether the outcome of the expert conferencing sessions would favor one Party or the other. The Claimants affirm that the Respondent has not provided evidence to satisfy the standard set out in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.69\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 45-46.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 45-46.\n\n***Admission into the Record of the June 11, 2017 Emails and the NIPC Letter***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nFirst, the Claimants state that they did not append the June 11, 2017 Emails to their application of June 19, 2017 in compliance with Procedural Order No. 1.70 They also contend that these emails call into question the Respondent\u2019s position in these proceedings that its counsel Aare Afe Babalola is solely financing the Respondent\u2019s costs, including the legal fees and expenses of Volterra Fietta and Mrs. Rameau71 As such, these emails go to the heart of the third-party funding issue and to the credibility of the Respondent\u2019s case.72 The Claimants further underline that the Tribunal provisionally admitted the June 11, 2017 Emails, without seeing them, after each Party had the opportunity to plead its case in writing and orally.73 The Claimants also submit that the fact that the origin of these emails and annexed documents was unknown is not in and of itself a bar to their admission into the record.74\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 47.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 48.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 48.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 49.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 50.\n\n60.\n\nSecond, the Claimants contend that the different treatment by the Tribunal of the June 11, 2017 Emails and the NIPC Letter was justified because there is no equivalence between these documents. For the Claimants, the NIPC Letter, a document created by the Respondent, directly contradicted the written testimony of one of the Respondent\u2019s experts who was scheduled to testify on the first day of the July 2017 Hearing. As such, the document was highly relevant. The Claimants note nevertheless that the Tribunal also admitted the NIPC Letter on a provisional basis75\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 51.\n\n61.\n\nThird, the Claimants submit that the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Tribunal did not read its written submissions prior to provisionally admitting them is unfounded. For the Claimants, the President of the Tribunal only referred to the Parties\u2019 oral pleadings at the hearing, not their prior written submissions, when he noted that the issue of privilege had not been discussed by the Parties thus far. The Claimants note that the President partially misspoke on that point as the Claimants\u2019 counsel did orally address the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the notion of legal privilege.76 The Claimants also note that Respondent\u2019s counsel made no direct mention of the issue of privilege during his oral presentation on the admission of the June 11, 2017 Emails77\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, paras. 52-53.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 54\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that the Proposal is a disguised invitation to review the Tribunal\u2019s decisions that the Respondent is unhappy with. For the Claimants, the Respondent has once again failed to provide any evidence of the Tribunal\u2019s manifest lack of independence and impartiality78\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, para. 55.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n**A. The Applicable Legal Standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It reads as follows:\n\n*A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.*\n\n64.\n\nThe disqualifications proposed in this case allege that all three members of the Tribunal manifestly lack the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address disqualification *\"on the ground that [an arbitrator] was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\"*\n\n65.\n\nA number of decisions have concluded that the word \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention means \"evident\" or \"obvious,\"79 and that it relates to the ease with which the alleged lack of the required qualities can be perceived.80\n\nSee *Suez,* \u00b6 34; *Alpha Projektholding GmbH v.

The Federal Government of Nigeria participates in Oil industry through NNPC\".91* Furthermore, and as pointed out by the Respondent, the NNPC has been designated under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention as a constituent agency of the Respondent, competent to become a party to a dispute submitted to the Centre.92\n\n*TOTAL et al.* v. *NNPC,* Partial Award dated December 12, 2013, para. 7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, March 12, 2014, para. 91\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, March 12, 2014, para. 96.\n\n74.\n\nIn addition, Professor Park noted in his explanations that the TOTAL et al v Nigeria Arbitration was highly publicized in Nigeria, given that one of the arbitrators had been kidnapped and held for ransom.93\n\nProf. Park\u2019s Explanations, para. 7.\n\n75.\n\nIn the Chairman\u2019s view, it is therefore reasonable to conclude that the Respondent knew or ought to have known that Nigeria\u2019s national oil company was the named respondent in arbitration proceedings initiated by TOTAL and other major oil companies. For the same reasons, the Respondent also knew or ought to have known, when it proposed the appointment of Professor Park as President in the present case on December 1, 2013, that Professor Park was a member of the tribunal in the TOTAL et al v. NNPC Arbitration. Finally, the Respondent knew or ought to have known the content of the award rendered by the tribunal in the TOTAL et al v. NNPC Arbitration upon or shortly after its issuance on December 13, 2013.\n\n76.\n\nThe proposal to disqualify Professor Park on Ground 2 was filed on August 16, 2017, which was 1342 days after the latest of the dates on which the Respondent became aware of the facts on which its Proposal is based. The Proposal could have been filed much earlier in the proceedings and was not filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n**Ground 3: Professor Park\u2019s and Professor Lew\u2019s Failure to Disclose Their Membership in the Task Force on Third Party Funding**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nFor purposes of the Respondent\u2019s Proposal, the membership of Professor Park and Professor Lew in the Task Force on Third Party Funding became relevant when the issue of third party funding arose in this case. This was at the time of the August 2016 Hearing.\n\n78.\n\nThe Proposal was filed on August 16, 2017, which was *3T1* days after the Respondent became aware of the facts on which its Proposal is based. Even if the Respondent became aware of these facts when Procedural Order No. 5 was issued on October 15, 2016, the Proposal was still filed 305 days thereafter. The Proposal could have been filed much earlier in the proceedings and was not filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n**Grounds 4 (i) to (v): The Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Irregularities Committed Before the July 2017 Hearing**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Ground 4(i): The Tribunal decided to defer the determination of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal decided to defer the determination of the Respondent\u2019s objection based on the Claimants\u2019 registration with the NIPC in its Decision on Jurisdiction issued on October, 29, 2014. The Proposal was filed on August 16, 2017, which was 1022 days after the Respondent became aware of the facts on which its Proposal rests. The Proposal could have been filed much earlier in the proceedings and was not filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n*Ground 4(ii): The Tribunal raised the issue of the comprehensiveness of the NIPC register*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal raised the allegedly irrelevant issue of the comprehensiveness of the NIPC register during the hearing on jurisdiction held on June 26, 2014. The Proposal was filed on August 16, 2017, which was 1147 days after the Respondent became aware of the facts on which its Proposal is based. The Proposal could have been filed much earlier in the proceedings and was not filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n*Ground 4(iii): The Tribunal has not sanctioned the Claimants\u2019 belated filings*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent does not specify which of the Claimants\u2019 memorials were filed belatedly. The Claimants have filed four memorials in these proceedings: two on jurisdiction, on April 11, 2014 (Counter-Memorial) and May 9, 2014 (Rejoinder), and two on the merits, on June 18, 2015 (Memorial on the Merits) and May 25, 2016 (Reply). The Proposal was filed on August 16, 2017, which was between 1223 and 448 days after the Respondent became aware of the facts on which its Proposal is based. The Proposal could have been filed much earlier in the proceedings and was not filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n*Ground 4(iv): The Tribunal ordered a second round of document production*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal ordered a second round of document production in its Procedural Order No. 4, which was issued on April 20, 2016. The Proposal was filed on August 16, 2017, which was 483 days after the Respondent became aware of the facts on which its Proposal is based. The Proposal could have been filed much earlier in the proceedings and was not filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n*Ground 4(v): The Tribunal ordered the Respondent\u2019s Attorney-General to confirm the Respondent\u2019s legal representation in writing*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nProcedural Order No. 5, in which the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to produce a written confirmation from its Attorney-General that Volterra Fietta and Mrs. Rameau are part of the Respondents\u2019 legal team, was issued on October 15, 2016. The Proposal was filed on August 16, 2017, which was 305 days after the Respondent became aware of the facts on which its Proposal is based. The Proposal could have been filed much earlier in the proceedings and was not filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n84.\n\nThe remaining grounds on which the Respondent\u2019s Proposal is based relate to facts that occurred at the hearing held on July 19-21, 2017. On August 4, 2017, the Respondent notified the Centre of its intention to file the Proposal. The Proposal was filed on August 16, 2107, which was 25 days after the July 2017 Hearing. The Proposal, with respect to these remaining grounds, was filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n**C. Merits**\n-------------\n\n85.\n\nThe remaining grounds on which the Respondent\u2019s Proposal is based concern all three members of the Tribunal. They relate to the Tribunal\u2019s comments on the integrity of the Respondent\u2019s counsel (Ground 1), and procedural irregularities allegedly committed during the July 2017 hearing (Ground 4 (vi *et seq.)*\n\n**1) Ground 1: The Tribunal\u2019s Comments Touching on the Integrity of the Respondent\u2019s Counsel**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Chairman notes from the Parties\u2019 submissions and the Challenged Arbitrators\u2019 explanations that the Tribunal, through its President, expressed its disappointment at not being able to conduct a conferencing session with the Parties\u2019 legal experts.\n\n87.\n\nThe Chairman also notes that the Tribunal expressed its disappointment multiple times: the Claimants raised the issue afresh the day after the Tribunal made its initial comments, prompting a reaction from the Respondent\u2019s counsel and thus the Tribunal to reiterate and explain again its position; the Respondent then made further comments on the Tribunal\u2019s position, prompting the Tribunal to express and explain it a third time.\n\n88.\n\nThe Chairman further notes that the Tribunal\u2019s references to the private conversation between Respondent\u2019s legal expert and its counsel was to indicate that the conversation was held in private and that the Tribunal was therefore unaware of its content and unable to comment on it.\n\n89.\n\nThe Chairman notes in addition that the President of the Tribunal stated three times that no fault was found or allocated regarding the fact that a conferencing session with the legal experts was not possible. This has been underlined by the Challenged Arbitrators in their explanations.94\n\nProf. Park\u2019s Explanations, para. 4; Prof. Lew\u2019s Explanations, para. 3; Justice Torgbor\u2019s Explanations, sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4.\n\n90.\n\nThe Chairman finally notes that the Tribunal confirmed at the hearing that there was no attempt on its part to impugn the conduct of the Respondent\u2019s counsel and that Mr. Adenipekun expressed his satisfaction over such confirmation.95 The Challenged Arbitrators have confirmed in their explanations that they had and have no reason to question Mr. Adenipekun\u2019s integrity.96\n\nTr. Day 3, 1029:6-12.\n\nProf. Park\u2019s Explanations, para. L Prof. Lew\u2019s Explanations, para. 6; Justice Torgbor\u2019s Explanations, section 2.1.4.\n\n91.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Chairman cannot agree with the Respondent\u2019s contention that *\"the Tribunal\u2019s repeated comments were actuated by a belief or perception that its lead counsel lacks integrity\"* nor that the Tribunal actually impugned the conduct and integrity of the Respondent\u2019s counsel.\n\n92.\n\nIn the Chairman\u2019s view, a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the Tribunal\u2019s comments and surrounding facts relied upon in the Respondent\u2019s Proposal, would not find a manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, Ground 1 does not support the Proposal, which must be rejected.\n\n**2) Ground 4 (vi** ***et seq.):*** **The Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Irregularities Committed During the July 2017 Hearing**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe procedural irregularities allegedly committed by the Tribunal during the July 2017 Hearing relate to the Tribunal\u2019s endeavors to hold a conferencing session with the legal experts, and to the admission into the record of the NIPC Letter and the June 11, 2017 Emails.\n\n***Expert conferencing***\n-------------------------\n\n94.\n\nHaving reviewed the Parties\u2019 submissions and the Tribunal\u2019s explanations, the Chairman finds that there is no basis to conclude that the Tribunal belatedly suggested a legal experts conferencing session for the sole purpose of assisting the Claimants.\n\n95.\n\nFirst, the hearing schedule provided for a 90-minute expert conferencing session at the end of the second hearing day. The schedule did not specify whether the conferencing session concerned all experts appearing at the hearing or only the damage experts that were also scheduled to testify that day.\n\n96.\n\nSecond, the Chairman does not consider that the manner in which the Tribunal suggested the possibility of holding an expert conferencing session with the legal experts was inappropriate. The Tribunal simply explained the reasons why hearing the legal experts together could be useful to the Tribunal in this case. As noted by Professor Lew in his explanations, *\"witness expert conferencing is widely used in international arbitration.\"*\n\n97.\n\nThird, the Chairman finds the Tribunal\u2019s expression of disappointment at not being able to hold a conferencing session with the legal experts to be a normal reaction in light of the Tribunal\u2019s view on the usefulness of such a session.\n\n98.\n\nFinally, the Chairman does not find the availability of the Claimants\u2019 experts after their testimony at the hearing to be \"inexplicable\" and indicative of a hidden motive, as the Respondent submits. Expert witnesses are usually not sequestered. It is therefore quite common for them to attend hearings in full, both before and after their testimony. This is especially the case when their counterparts still have to testify before the Tribunal. Professor Oditah\u2019s willingness and availability to participate in a possible expert conferencing session is, in the Chairman\u2019s view, unsurprising.\n\n***Admission of the NIPC Letter and June 11, 2017 Emails into the record***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nHaving reviewed the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal\u2019s explanations and the record of this case, the Chairman does not consider the Respondent\u2019s grievances to be founded.\n\n100.\n\nFirst, the Chairman notes that the Tribunal had not announced, as contended by the Respondent, that it would hear the Parties on the admission of both the NIPC Letter and the June 11, 2017 Emails. In its email to the Parties dated July 7, 2017, the Tribunal indeed indicated:\n\n*\"[...] Also, the Parties will note that, without prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s final decision regarding the need for post-hearing submissions, time allocations for closing arguments have been reduced to 90 minutes, **so as to allow one hour at the end of the Hearing for the Parties to present oral submissions regarding the admissibility into the record of the June 11, 2017 emails.***\n\n*In this respect, the Tribunal takes note of the Claimants\u2019 email dated July 5, 2017 regarding the Respondent\u2019s response to their application dated June 19, 2017. The Claimants may submit written observations on the Respondent\u2019s response by July 14, 2017 at the latest. This issue will, as indicated above, be addressed on Day 3 of the Hearing.*\n\n***Finally,** the Tribunal takes note of the Respondent\u2019s response **regarding the NIPC letter dated September 26, 2016** and, without prejudice to its decision regarding the document\u2019s admission into the record, invites the Respondent to submit by July 17, 2017 any comments on the evidential value of the document at the latest. **As necessary,** **this issue will be addressed at the outset of Day 1 of the Hearing.***\" (emphasis added)\n\n101.\n\nSecond, the Chairman does not consider that the President\u2019s remark as to when the Respondent first raised the issue of privilege indicates that the Tribunal did not read the Respondent\u2019s prior written submissions. The President of the Tribunal clarified at the hearing that he was referring to the Parties\u2019 oral submissions on the third hearing day.97 A review of the transcript confirms that counsel for the Respondent in its oral presentation on the admission of the June 11, 2017 Emails did not address the question of privilege. It is true that the issue of privilege was indeed addressed that morning by counsel for the Claimants in its presentation. However, this inaccuracy on the part of the President is insufficient ground for the Chairman to conclude that the Tribunal members did not read the Respondent\u2019s submissions.\n\nTr. Day 3, 1001:10-20.\n\n102.\n\nThird, the Chairman does not view the different treatment of the NIPC Letter and the June 11, 2017 Emails by the Tribunal when it admitted them into the record to be a procedural irregularity. The Tribunal simply implemented the directions it had given the Parties in its email dated July 7, 2017. Per Professor Park\u2019s explanations, these directions were meant to allow the Parties adequate time to address the matters and to ensure completion of the examination of all experts scheduled to testify at the hearing. The President recalls in that respect that as the August 2016 had been adjourned without completing experts examination, neither side wished the July 2017 Hearing not to follow the established scheduled.98\n\nProf. Park\u2019s Explanations, para. 13.\n\n103.\n\nFinally, the Chairman rejects the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Tribunal circumvented the need for \"exceptional circumstances\" prescribed by paragraph 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1 in provisionally admitting the June 11, 2017 Emails. As made clear by the President of the Tribunal at the hearing, the Tribunal found \"exceptional circumstances\" because the June 11, 2017 Emails came to light shortly before the July 2017 hearing and relate to some of the issues decided in Procedural Order No. 5.99\n\nTr. Day 3, 999:3-9. In that respect, the Chairman notes that Judge\u2019s Torgbor indicated in his explanations that *\"the emails came into the Claimants\u2019 possession some 9 months before their transmission to the Tribunal\u2019s secretary.\"* (p. 6). The Chairman understands this reference to *\"the emails''* to be to a reference *\"the NIPC Letter\",* which was dated September 26, 2016, i.e. 9 months before the emails were received on June 11, 2017.\n\n104.\n\nIn the Chairman\u2019s view, a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the Tribunal\u2019s conduct and decisions at the July 2017 Hearing would not find a manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, Grounds 4 vi. *et seq.* do not support the Proposal, which must be rejected.\n\n**IV.

Market Street, Suite 705, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, U.S.A.\n\n2.\n\nClaimants are represented in this arbitration by Mr. Olasupo Shasore, SAN and Mr. Bello Salihu of ALP, Lagos, Nigeria; Mr. Oba Nsugbe QC of 3 Pump Court, Temple, London, United Kingdom; and Ms. Bimpe Nkontchou of ADR Africa Limited, London, United Kingdom.\n\n**B.** ***Respondent***\n-----------------------\n\n3.\n\nRespondent is the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Claimants' Request for Arbitration (\"RfA\") was notified to the Attorney General for the Federation and Minister for Justice, Federal Ministry of Justice, Shehu Shagari Way, Central Area, Abuja, Nigeria.\n\n4.\n\nRespondent is represented in this arbitration by a team led by Mr. Aare Afe Babalola SAN and comprising Mr. Adebayo Adenipekun SAN, Mr. Olu Daramola, Mr. Oluwasina Ogungbade, Mr. Kehinde Ogunwumiju, Mr. Ola Faro, and Mrs. Esther Adenipekun, all of Emmanuel Chambers, Lagos, Nigeria, Mr. Robert Volterra and Mr. \u00c1lvaro Nistal of Volterra Fietta, London, United Kingdom, and Ms. Rose Rameau of Rameau Law Firm in Washington, D.C., USA.\n\n**II. Overview of the Dispute**\n-------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered all of the Parties' submissions and the arguments and evidence presented by them in these proceedings. This Award will focus on the materials determinative to its decisions and the resolution of this dispute. All issues have been considered. Any request for relief not expressly granted in this Award is hereby denied.\n\n**A.** ***Summary of Facts***\n-----------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe facts giving rise to this dispute on the merits are largely uncontested. The main differences between the Parties reside in the legal qualification of these events and in whether Respondent bears culpability or liability for them. The Tribunal adopts the \"Overview of the Dispute\" contained in its Decision on Preliminary Objections. Below, the Tribunal summarizes the factual submissions that were most relevant to the Tribunal's decisions. The Tribunal's factual findings as they relate to the arguments submitted and the claims raised are presented within the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n7.\n\nNigeria is among the world's largest producers of oil and its oil assets are managed by the state-owned authority, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (\"NNPC\").1 This dispute centers on Claimants' investment in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria, which resulted in the joint venture, ownership, and operation of Nigerian Oil Mining Lease 98 (\"OML 98\") and Oil Prospecting License 275 (\"OPL 275\") through a Nigerian corporate entity, Pan Ocean Oil Company (\"POOC\" or \"Pan Ocean\").\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 5.1.\n\n8.\n\nThis joint venture is known as the \"NNPC/POOC Joint Venture.\" Pan Ocean is the operator of OML 98 and holder of OPL 275. The current lease output is approximately 50,000 bpd of crude oil.2 Until 1998, Claimants were the 100% beneficial owner of the 40% participating interest in OML 98 and related assets (as Pan Ocean) and Respondent was the owner of 60% of the participating interest (as NNPC).3 The subject of this arbitration is Claimants' 40% participating interest in OML 98 and OPL 275, created by the joint venture.4\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 4.2.\n\nRfA \u00b6 14; Claimants' Memorial \u00b6 1.3.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 7.2.\n\n9.\n\nClaimants allege that they alone invested capital in the Asaboro and Ogharefe fields to make OML 98 profitable. Since July 1998, Claimants made further investments by discharging the 40% of the contributed operational costs to the production of OML 98 and all other operations of Pan Ocean, including the acquisition of a second rig and the purchase of another oil block OPL 275, in 2007 or 2008.

Dr. Fabbri and Mrs. Timolini divorced prior to his death. While the Parties agree that Mrs. Timolini yielded whatever interest she may have had to the estate of Dr. Fabbri in 2010, her alleged ownership of Impex, which owns Claimant companies, may have been an intervening factor with respect to Respondent's refusal to acknowledge communications from Mrs. Timolini regarding the ownership of the shares.32 Claimants have alleged that the beneficial interest of Claimants was owned by Dr. Fabbri until his death.33 Claimants have also alleged that, prior to his death, Dr. Fabbri transferred 100% of the beneficial interest in Impex to his ex-wife via stock transfer agreement on 13 January 1998, in the presence of his eldest son, Mr. Patrizio Fabbri.34 Respondent never recognized the validity of this transfer, and the transfer was declared invalid by Justice Olomojobi of the Federal High Court of Nigeria.35\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 79; Witness Statement of Jacques Jones \u00b6\u00b6 24-37.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 1.4.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 1.4; Claimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 5, 77; Respondent's Appendix A.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 1.4.\n\n27.\n\nIn March 2000, Chief Sena Anthony, Legal Advisor to the NNPC, wrote a letter in response to an inquiry by Mrs. Timolini and confirmed that the NNPC's consent was not required in case of change of Pan Ocean's ultimate beneficial ownership.36 Chief Anthony advised, however, that they seek the consent of the Government and of the other shareholders. Claimants allege that this is how they discovered the first irregular issuance of shares by Dr. Fadeyi to a third person, Mr. Tomisin. Respondent submits that the communications sent to the NNPC on behalf of Mrs. Timolini were only aimed at obtaining an acknowledgment or confirmation of her asserted beneficial ownership of Pan Ocean.37\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 20; Respondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 41, citing Letter from Chief Sena Anthony (Group General Manager, NNPC) to Mr. Jacques Jones, dated 30 March 2000, original Exhibit C-36, renumbered Exhibit C-42.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 39-41.\n\n28.\n\nIn May 2002, Pan Ocean and NNPC entered into a Joint Operating Agreement.38\n\nRespondent's Appendix A; Joint Operating Agreement between Pan Ocean Oil Corporation (Nigeria) and the NNPC, 28 May 2002, Exhibits R-11(1) and R-11(1)PLUS.\n\n29.\n\nOn 16 December 2002, Claimants initiated a claim against Dr. Fadeyi and others, seeking declarations that Claimants were the beneficial owners of Pan Ocean and seeking to nullify all purported general and board meetings following September 1998, among other actions occurring after that date.

In the RfA, Claimants requested that the Tribunal render an award:\n\n\"a) Declaring that Respondent has breached its obligations to the Claimants under NIPC [Act];\n\nb) Directing the Respondent to restore only the nominees of the Claimants as representatives in the 40 % participating interest under the operations of all Joint Venture Agreements and in particular OML 98 and OPL 275;\n\nc) Finding that any purported transfer or acquisition of the 100% interest of the Claimants or any part thereof in 40% of OML 98/OPL 275 or any other asset including its accumulated proceeds howsoever without the consent of the Claimants is an indirect expropriation of its participating interest in the leases;\n\nd) Directing the Respondent, its relevant privies and instrumentalities to pay damages in an amount to be proven at the hearing but which the Claimants presently estimate to be in excess of $500,000,000 (Five Hundred Million United States Dollars);\n\ne) Directing the Respondent, its relevant privies and instrumentalities to pay aggravated damages in the sum of $150,000,000 (One Hundred and Fifty Million United States Dollars) or such amount as may be proven by the Claimants at the hearing;\n\nf) Restitution of the undiluted 40% participating interest in OML 98 and OPL 275 and all monies accruing thereto, by receiving the proceeds of unjust enrichment controlled in trust for the Claimants to date;\n\ng) Directing that the Claimants be reinstated as the beneficial owner of the 40% participating interest in OML 98;\n\nh) Directing the Respondent to pay the Claimants' interest and taxes on all sums awarded;\n\ni) Directing the Respondents to pay the Claimants' costs associated with these proceedings including professional fees and disbursements on a full indemnity basis; and\n\nj) Ordering such further or other relief(s) as the Tribunal deems appropriate in the circumstances.\"\n\n47.\n\nOn 12 August 2013, the ICSID Secretariat responded to Claimants and asked that Claimants answer several questions prior to registration of the RfA.\n\n48.\n\nOn 19 August 2013, Claimants responded to the Secretariat.\n\n49.\n\nOn 9 September 2013, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the RfA pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B.** ***Constitution of Tribunal***\n-------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nOn 11 November 2013, Claimants requested that the Arbitral Tribunal be constituted pursuant to the formula provided by Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On 9 December 2013, Professor Julian D. M. Lew, a national of the United Kingdom, accepted his appointment as arbitrator appointed by Claimants, and Justice Edward Torgbor, a national of the United Kingdom and Ghana, accepted his appointment as arbitrator appointed by Respondent.\n\n51.\n\nOn 11 December 2013, Professor William W. Park, a national of the United States and Switzerland, accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal appointed by the Parties. The Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20 was constituted on 11 December 2013 in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**C.** ***First Session and Initial Order***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nOn 13 February 2014, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first session at the World Bank office in Paris. During that session, the Parties agreed on procedural issues and addressed outstanding issues that are outlined in more detail below.\n\n53.\n\nOn 27 February 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 containing a schedule of submissions on the following preliminary objections raised by Respondent, as set forth in its Section 14:\n\n\"14.1.1. Respondent did not consent to submit this dispute to arbitration by ICSID [\"Objection 1\"];\n\n14.1.2. Section 26 of the Nigerian Investment Protection Commission Act (\"NIPC\") does not provide a basis for finding consent on the part of Respondent as it merely provides that disputes should be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Rules [\"Objection 2\"];\n\n14.1.3. Claimants are not registered with the NIPC and therefore cannot rely on Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act to invoke the jurisdiction of ICSID, and Claimants misled the Secretariat of ICSID to register their Request for Arbitration when they falsely claimed that their enterprise was registered with the NIPC. Pleadings on this objection shall be limited to whether Claimants are registered and the bearing of registration on the Tribunal's jurisdiction [\"Objection 3\"];\n\n14.1.4. Respondent is not a competent party to this arbitration. Claimants' pleadings on this objection should identify the law and legal authorities on which they intend to rely and the corresponding liability of Respondent [\"Objection 4\"];\n\n14.1.5. Claimants' claims are barred by statute [\"Objection 5\"]; and\n\n14.1.6. The request is premature in that Claimants failed to explore local remedies/conditions precedent contained in the NIPC Act [\"Objection 6\"].\n\n**D.** ***Submissions, Hearing and Decision on Jurisdiction***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nOn 14 March 2014, Respondent filed its \"Memorial on Objection to Jurisdiction\" (\"Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction\") with supporting documentation.\n\n55.\n\nOn 11 April 2014, Claimants filed their \"Counter-Memorial Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1 of 24 February 2014\" (\"Claimants' Counter-Memorial\") with supporting documentation.\n\n56.\n\nOn 25 April 2014, Respondent filed its \"Reply Memorial\" (\"Respondent's Reply\") with supporting documentation.\n\n57.\n\nOn 9 May 2014, Claimants filed their \"Rejoinder to the Respondent's Reply in Respect of the Respondent's Notice of Objection to Jurisdiction\" (\"Claimants' Rejoinder\") with supporting documentation.\n\n58.\n\nOn 26 June 2014, the Tribunal and the Parties held a Hearing on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London.

The Tribunal finds that Section 26 does indeed constitute such a standing offer. However, questions related to the adequacy of the Claimants' acceptance of that offer are joined to the merits;\n\nObjections 2 (Role of the ICSID Rules), 4 (Proper Party) and 5 (Time Bars) are rejected; and\n\nObjections 3 (Registration) and 6 (Premature Filing) are joined to the merits.\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6 147.\n\n**E.** ***Proceedings on the Merits***\n--------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nOn 5 February 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 with an updated procedural calendar.\n\n67.\n\nOn 18 June 2015, Claimants filed their \"Points of Claim\" (\"Claimants' Memorial\") with supporting documentation.\n\n68.\n\nOn 17 November 2015, Respondent filed its \"First Memorial\" (\"Respondent's Counter-Memorial\") with supporting documentation.\n\n69.\n\nOn 17 February 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the production of documents.\n\n70.\n\nOn 20 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the production of documents.\n\n71.\n\nOn 25 May 2016, Claimants filed their \"Reply to Respondent's First Memorial dated 17th November 2015\" (\"Claimants' Reply\") along with supporting documentation.\n\n72.\n\nOn 26 July 2016, Respondent filed its \"Rejoinder\" (\"Respondent's Rejoinder\") along with supporting documentation.\n\n73.\n\nFrom 2 August until 4 August 2016, the Tribunal held a Hearing on the Merits (the \"Hearing\") in London.

Jurisdiction**\n--------------------\n\n**A.** ***Overview***\n---------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Claimants invoked the Tribunal's jurisdiction, pursuant to the ICSID Rules, based upon Section 26 of the NIPC Act, set forth as follows:\n\nDispute settlement procedures\n\n(1) Where a dispute arises between an investor an any Government of the Federation in respect of an enterprise, all efforts shall be made through mutual discussion to reach an amicable settlement.\n\n(2) Any dispute between an investor and any Government of the Federation in respect of an enterprise to which this Act applies which is not amicably settled through mutual discussions, may be submitted at the option of the aggrieved party to arbitration as follows\u2014\n\n(a) In the case of a Nigerian investor, in accordance with the rules of procedure for arbitration as specified in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act; or\n\n(b) In the case of a foreign investor, within the framework of any bilateral or multilateral agreement on investment protection to which the Federal Government and the country of which the investor is a national are parties; or\n\n(c) In accordance with any other national or international machinery for the settlement of investment disputes agreed on by the parties.\n\n(3) Where in respect of a dispute, there is disagreement between the investor and the Federal Government as to the method of dispute settlement to be adopted, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes Rules shall apply.\n\n100.\n\nWith respect to its jurisdictional determination, the Tribunal's Decision on Preliminary Objections of 29 October 2014 rejected three of Respondent's preliminary jurisdictional objections, summarized in Section 14 of Procedural Order No. 1 as follows:\n\n\"14.1.1. Respondent did not consent to submit this dispute to arbitration by ICSID [Objection 1 (Consent)];\n\n14.1.2. Section 26 of the Nigerian Investment Protection Commission Act (\"NIPC\") does not provide a basis for finding consent on the part of Respondent as it merely provides that disputes should be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Rules [Objection 2 (Role of the ICSID Rules)];\n\n14.1.3. Claimants are not registered with the NIPC and therefore cannot rely on Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act to invoke the jurisdiction of ICISD, and Claimants misled the Secretariat of ICSID to register their Request for Arbitration when they falsely claimed that their enterprise was registered with the NIPC. Pleadings on this objection shall be limited to whether Claimants are registered and the bearing of registration on the Tribunal's jurisdiction [Objection 3 (Registration)];\n\n14.1.4. Respondent is not a competent party to this arbitration. Claimants' pleadings on this objection should identify the law and legal authorities on which they intend to rely and the corresponding liability of Respondent [Objection 4 (Proper Party)];\n\n14.1.5. Claimants' claims are barred by statute [Objection 5 (Time Bars)];\n\nand\n\n14.1.6. The request is premature in that Claimants failed to explore local remedies/conditions precedent contained in the NIPC Act [Objection 6 (Premature Filing)].\n\n101.\n\nObjection 1 (Consent) was rejected insofar as it called into question whether Section 26 of the NIPC Act constituted a standing offer to arbitrate. The Tribunal recalls that Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act provides that where disagreement exists between the investor and the Federal Government as to the method of dispute settlement, the ICSID Rules shall apply. The Tribunal found that Section 26 did indeed constitute such a standing offer to arbitrate under the ICSID Rules.\n\n102.\n\nQuestions related to the adequacy of Claimants' acceptance of that offer were joined to the merits. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the adequacy of Claimants' acceptance of Respondent's offer to arbitrate under the ICSID Rules (such as to meet the conditions set by the NIPC Act) intertwines with questions of registration and premature filing,71 each of which formed an independently articulated objection to jurisdiction, as noted below.\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6 67.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal joined to the merits of the case two other objections: Objection No. 3 related to Registration under the NIPC Act and Objection No. 6 related to Premature Filing of the Claims.\n\n104.\n\nConsequently, following the 2014 Jurisdictional Decision,72 the Tribunal was left with jurisdictional objections related to: (i) the adequacy of Claimants' acceptance of Respondent's standing offer to arbitrate under the NIPC Act (Objection 1), (ii) registration requirements for an enterprise under the NIPC Act (Objection 3), and (iii) premature filing of Claims (Objection 6),73 with the first objection (adequacy of acceptance) implicating both registration and timeliness of filing.\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6\u00b6 67, 96, 104, 145, 147.\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6 147.\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted Respondent's objections related to the Decision on Preliminary Objections74 and responds that each Party presented further arguments and provided additional evidence related to the remaining objections in their subsequent pleadings.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 312 et seq.\n\n106.\n\nThe jurisdictional landscape became more complex after Respondent's Counter-Memorial (17 November 2015), which raised jurisdictional objections related to: (i) whether some of Claimants' claims fall outside the scope of the NIPC Act and, therefore, are not covered by any consent to arbitration contained in Section 26 of the NIPC Act;75 and (ii) whether claims in respect of the actions of private individuals, and their alleged violations of Claimants' rights, are attributable to Respondent.76\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 173.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 321 et seq.\n\n107.\n\nSubject to the comments below on \"Further Jurisdictional Objections\" (*infra*) the Tribunal has grouped Respondent's challenges to the Tribunal's jurisdiction into five (5) bases, some of which overlap: (i) the adequacy of acceptance of Respondent's offer to arbitrate under the NIPC Act, which implicates registration and premature filing; (ii) Pan Ocean's lack of registration under the NIPC Act; (iii) the premature nature of the filing of claims, due to Claimants' alleged failure to seek amicable settlement; (iv) whether the scope of consent to ICSID arbitration under the NIPC Act includes expropriation claims and claims based on customary international law, and (v) attribution to Respondent of actions of private individuals.\n\n**B.** ***Jurisdictional Objections***\n--------------------------------------\n\n(1) Existence of Dispute\n------------------------\n\n108.\n\nRespondent has alleged that none of the three preconditions to the applicability of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules apply and, thus, the Tribunal cannot have jurisdiction. The three conditions are: (i) there must be a dispute, (ii) the Parties were unable to settle the dispute by way of mutual discussion, and (iii) there must be disagreement between the investor and Respondent regarding the method of dispute resolution. As to points (ii) and (iii) (and other aspects of the adequacy of Claimants' acceptance of the offer to arbitrate) the Tribunal addresses the relevant contentions through its separate analysis of Registration and Premature Filing.77\n\nSee *infra* p. 36 *et seq*. and 42 *et seq*.\n\n109.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal explores the existence of a dispute. The Parties agree that Section 26 of the NIPC Act places upon Claimants the burden of establishing, at the outset, that there is a legal dispute between Respondent and the alleged investor, here, Claimants.78 Respondent has argued that there was no legal dispute between Claimants and Respondent.79\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial \u00b6 23; Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 121.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 121.\n\n110.\n\nClaimants have responded that they are in a dispute with Respondent involving the protection of their investment in Nigeria.80 The Tribunal noted in its Decision on Jurisdiction that it has jurisdiction over the dispute, so long as that is in relation to Claimants' allegations of a violation of international law.81 Insofar as Claimants complain to have had their rights violated by Respondent and Respondent denies this, there is a dispute between the Parties that can support a claim.82\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial \u00b6 24.\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6 112.\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6 115.\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that it does not have jurisdiction over Claimants' contractual claims, although they might form part of the factual matrix to be considered in relation to Claimants' arguments about violations of international law.83 The Tribunal affirms its findings in paragraphs 112 and 115 of the Decision on Preliminary Objections, that this dispute involves Claimants' allegation that Respondent conspired to seize ownership and control of Pan Ocean from Claimants.\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6 112.\n\n112.\n\nTo the extent that Respondent has alleged that Claimants' failure to exhaust domestic remedies precludes this Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Tribunal notes that a jurisdictional requirement of exhaustion need not be implied into Article 26 of the NIPC.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal will address matters related to exhaustion of remedies, to the extent relevant, in the sections on \"Liability and Damages.\"\n\n(2) Registration of Pan Ocean as a Jurisdictional Pre-Requisite\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\na.

Respondent's Objection\n-------------------------\n\n114.\n\nRespondent asserts that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over this dispute because neither Claimants nor their purported investment vehicle, Pan Ocean, are registered with the NIPC as required by the NIPC Act, and therefore cannot rely on Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act.84 In Respondent's words, \"Pan Ocean's lack of registration under the NIPC Act prevents the Claimants from properly accepting any offer to arbitrate under the Act.\"85\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 1.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 179.\n\n115.\n\nSection 26 of the NIPC Act allows investors to submit to arbitration only disputes \"in respect of an enterprise\" to which the Act applies,86 and the definition of \"enterprise\" under Section 31 \"establishes that 'where there is foreign participation' only industries, projects, undertakings or businesses that are 'duly registered with the [NIPC]' may qualify as an 'enterprise' under the NIPC Act.\"87 Thus, since Pan Ocean is not duly registered with the NIPC, it does not qualify as an \"enterprise\" under the NIPC Act. Therefore, the \"remedies and standards of treatment offered in the NIPC Act do not apply to Pan Ocean and cannot be invoked by Claimants.\"88 Further, since Section 31 of the NIPC Act requires local companies with foreign participation to be registered with the NIPC, Pan Ocean's lack of registration would entail that it cannot be considered as a national of another Contracting State, including for the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.89\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 183-184, citing Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission Act, Cap 117 LFN 1995, Section 26(2), Legal Authority RL-1.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 186, citing Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission Act, Cap 117 LFN 1995, Section 31, Legal Authority RL-1.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 204.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 208.\n\n116.\n\nRespondent contends that the registration requirement applies to entities existing before the entry into force of the NIPC Act. Respondent rejects the interpretation of Sections 19 and 20 of the NIPC Act proposed by Claimants. First, Respondent distinguishes between the requirements that companies must meet to carry on business, governed by Sections 19 and 20, and the possibility to resort to arbitration provided for in Section 26 of the NIPC Act, to which the definition of \"enterprise\" contained in Section 31 of the NIPC Act applies.90 Second, Respondent argues that, even if Section 20 of the NIPC Act was considered to apply only to companies commencing business after its enactment, such pre-existing companies wishing to benefit from provisions of the NIPC Act must still register with the NIPC.91 As for the \"grandfather clause\" in Section 29 of the NIPC Act, Respondent contends that the provision only applies to approvals granted and not to registration. In any case, there is no evidence that Pan Ocean was granted any approval under previous statutes.92 Moreover, if the registration requirement does not apply to pre-existing companies, \"that must necessarily entail that the NIPC Act is not applicable to those entities.\"93\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 165-168.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 169, citing First Expert Report of Mr. Mustafa Bello \u00b6 37, and Second Expert Report of Mr. Mustafa Bello \u00b6 9.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 172.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 174.\n\n117.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants have failed to provide evidence that the registers were unreliable. In any case, \"the reliability of the registry is irrelevant because the Claimants have not proven that they ever requested that Pan Ocean be registered.\"94 The procedure to register a company is straightforward and Claimants bear the burden of proving any shortcoming on the part of the NIPC. Here, Claimants have failed to prove that they attempted to file an application or even communicate about the issue with Pan Ocean.95\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 13.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 213-215.\n\n118.\n\nRespondent further argues that Claimants have failed to demonstrate how any act attributable to Respondent would have prevented them from fulfilling the registration requirement96 or that they ever instructed Pan Ocean's management to comply with the requirement.97 Claimants bore the responsibility of ensuring that Pan Ocean, the purported vehicle of their investment in Nigeria, was duly registered with the NIPC.98 According to Respondent, the registration requirement arose in 1995 when the NIPC Act was enacted, and even if Claimants lost control of Pan Ocean in 1998 as they claim, they should have ensured that Pan Ocean was registered in the intervening period between 1995 and 1998.99\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 217.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 161, 220.\n\nRespondent's Reply \u00b6 42.\n\nRespondent's Reply \u00b6 42; Respondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 217.\n\n119.\n\nIn these proceedings, Respondent contends that Claimants falsely represented that Pan Ocean was registered and have since admitted that Pan Ocean was not registered.100 Claimants' alternative argument that they genuinely believed that Pan Ocean would have complied with the registration requirements \"confirms that the Claimants themselves undertook no measures to ensure that Pan Ocean was registered since the entry into force of the NIPC Act.\"101\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 160, citing Claimants' Rejoinder \u00b6 14.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 165, citing Claimants' Rejoinder \u00b6 12.\n\n120.\n\nAt the Continued Hearing of 19 July 2017, the Tribunal admitted into the record, without any determination as to its probative value, a letter from the NIPC to the firm Ajumogobia & Okeke dated 26 September 2016, which confirmed that Pan Ocean is not registered, and acknowledged receipt of two letters of 2012 and 2013 inquiring about the status of the company.102 At most, the letter shows that Claimants made inquiries about whether Pan Ocean was registered. These inquiries, however, do not satisfy the registration requirement.103 Moreover, any delay in responding to that inquiry is irrelevant, because Claimants could have verified their registration status by sending one of their representatives to the relevant registry.104\n\nContinued Hearing Transcript Day 1, 145:3-17; Letter from the NIPC to Ajumogobia & Okeke, 26 September 2016, Exhibit C-156.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 13.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 13, citing Mr. Bello's statement, Continued Hearing Transcript Day 1, 410:1-5.\n\n121.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that the concepts of estoppel and acquiescence cannot be used to broaden the Tribunal's jurisdiction.105 Claimants failed to demonstrate how the joint venture operations between NNPC and Pan Ocean would amount to acquiescence, and did not establish how NNPC's actions would have caused Claimants' alleged detrimental reliance.106 Moreover, Respondent contends that NNPC's alleged acts or omissions do not constitute \"acts of State by the Respondent.\"107\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 223, citing *Eureko B.V. v. Slovak Republic* (UNCITRAL), PCA Case No. 2008-13, Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, 26 October 2010, \u00b6 219, Legal Authority RL-34.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 224, 226.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 225.\n\n122.\n\nRespondent has also submitted that Claimants misled the Secretariat of ICSID to register the Request for Arbitration by falsely claiming that the enterprise was registered with the NIPC. It has urged the Tribunal to refuse jurisdiction on that basis.108\n\nRespondent's Reply \u00b6 9.\n\nii. Claimants' Position\n-----------------------\n\n123.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's contention that an enterprise with foreign participation must be registered to benefit from protection under the NIPC Act in all cases. The stated purpose of the NIPC Act is to encourage and assist investment in Nigeria and to create a conducive environment for the same.109 These aims would be undermined if foreign investors were denied protections under the NIPC Act simply because they failed to register their \"enterprise.\"\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n124.\n\nClaimants observe that the definition of \"enterprise\" as being \"duly registered with the Commission\" in Section 31 of the NIPC Act is subject to the qualification \"[i]n this Act, unless the context otherwise requires.\"110 The relevant \"context\" here is that Claimants made a long-standing, significant, and successful investment in Nigeria in partnership with Respondent and that this investment benefitted Respondent.111 Claimants, thus, should not be automatically deprived of the protections of the NIPC Act for the simple reason that the enterprise was not registered. By insisting on registration, Respondent is relying on an artificial technicality, while Pan Ocean complied \"in every way with any reasonable categorisation of an investment.\"112\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6 27, citing Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission Act, Cap 117 LFN 1995, Section 31, Legal Authority CL-1.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 24, 28.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6 30.\n\n125.\n\nIn any event, Pan Ocean is exempt from the registration requirement because the NIPC Act does not state that enterprises existing before its enactment, including Pan Ocean, must be registered.113 Other investment instruments entered into by Nigeria contain language providing for retroactive application, and this suggests that Nigeria would have done the same in the NIPC Act if that was its intention.114 In the alternative, the absence of such language presents an ambiguity that should be resolved in favor of foreign investors, in light of the stated purpose of the NIPC Act.115\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6 26, citing Claimants' Digest of Clauses in BITs, original Exhibit C-7, renumbered Exhibit C-13.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6 29.\n\n126.\n\nSeveral provisions of the NIPC Act confirm that enterprises operating in Nigeria prior to 1995, like Pan Ocean, were not required to register with the NIPC to be \"enterprises\" within the meaning of NIPC Act and entitled to investment protections and guarantees.116 The wording of Sections 19 and 20 of the NIPC Act confirms that the duty to register does not apply to pre-existing companies, as these sections provide that an enterprise in which \"foreign participation is permitted\" shall not \"commence\" business unless it is incorporated or registered under the Companies and Allied Matters Act 1990 (\"CAMA\") (Section 19), and shall \"before commencing business, apply to the Commission for registration (Section 20).\"117 This interpretation \"is reinforced by the documents required for registration which by their nature relate to new businesses.\"118 Moreover, the \"grandfather clause\" contained in Section 29(2) of the NIPC Act made registration unnecessary for existing businesses, which could continue to rely on previous approvals obtained under the repealed legislation.119 Finally, Claimants point out that the NIPC Act is unclear as to the legal effects of registration with the NIPC.120\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, citing Expert Opinion of Professor Fidelis Oditah \u00b6 19.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 40, citing Expert Opinion of Professor Fidelis Oditah \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 40, citing the statements of Professor Fidelis Oditah, Continued Hearing Transcript Day 1, 225-228.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 40, citing Expert Opinion of Professor Fidelis Oditah \u00b6\u00b6 32 et seq.\n\n127.\n\nClaimants also challenge the \"reliability\" or \"comprehensiveness\" of the registers produced by Respondent.121 Respondent provided two versions of the list of registered companies that are inconsistent and contain errors and discrepancies.122 The entries of one of the lists only started in 2006, eleven years after the NIPC Act.123 Moreover, \"missing from the register(s) are five of the six other (Pan Ocean being the seventh) Joint Venture Partners (foreign investors) with NNPC in Nigeria namely Shell, Mobil, Chevron, Elf and Texaco (in their own rights and/or through their subsidiaries)\", which invested Nigeria prior to the establishment of the NIPC.124 Respondent's suggestion that all these entities could not claim the NIPC Act's protections is \"illusionary.\"125\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 43, referring to NIPC Business Registry, 30 June 2014, Exhibit R-15 and Second Expert Report of Mr. Mustafa Bello, Annex 5.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 43.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 43, referring to NIPC Business Registry, 30 June 2014, Exhibit R-15.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 43.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 43, citing Mr. Bello's statement, Continued Hearing Transcript Day 1, 401:19-22, and 402:1-4.\n\n128.\n\nClaimants did not seek to mislead the ICSID Secretariat by stating that Pan Ocean had been registered with the NIPC. They state that their requests for proof of registration from the NIPC went unanswered and that they \"genuinely believed that Pan Ocean would have registered its undertaking with the Commission.\"126 Respondent, however, has an obligation under NIPC Act to keep records of the companies to which it applies and to assist enterprises and foreign investors. The failure to answer to Claimants' inquiries as to registration confirms the uncooperative attitude of Respondent and its instrumentalities.127 Furthermore, Claimants highlight that they have lost control over Pan Ocean and this left gaps in their knowledge.128\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6 12.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6 14.\n\n129.\n\nFinally, Claimants argue that even if the Tribunal concluded that registration is a precondition of consent, Respondent is estopped from raising that objection to jurisdiction. Respondent, by operating as a joint venture partner with Pan Ocean, has not insisted that Pan Ocean be registered even though Respondent's own instrumentality \"possesses and controls the register.\"129 Since Respondent collaborated with those who control Pan Ocean and failed to raise the lack of registration, it should be considered to have waived the registration requirement or, as a matter of fairness, be estopped from relying on it.130\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 38.\n\nb. The Tribunal's Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThere is no dispute as to whether Pan Ocean exists, although some uncertainty may exist concerning whether Pan Ocean was registered pursuant to the NIPC Act, and what the legal effect registration might be on Claimants' claims.\n\n131.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that the following matters were so intertwined with the merits that they must be considered during the merits phase:\n\n\u2022 \"The definition of 'enterprise';\n\n\u2022 Applicability of the registration requirement to entities existing before enactment of the NIPC Act;\n\n\u2022 Reliability of the NIPC business register filed by the Respondent;\n\n\u2022 The Claimants [sic] inability to register Pan Ocean, such inability allegedly deriving in part from the Respondent's actions, as well as the fact that the Claimants are outside the management of the company; and\n\n\u2022 Estoppel based on the Respondent's alleged lack of complaint about registration during prior cooperation with the Claimants.\"131\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6 102.\n\n132.\n\nThe issue before the Tribunal is not whether Pan Ocean was authorized to do business in Nigeria or whether registration for that purpose was validly waived at the latest when NNPC and Pan Ocean renewed the Joint Operating Agreement (\"JOA\") in 2002. Rather, the first jurisdictional issue is whether and how Nigeria limited its consent to arbitrate to those enterprises that were registered and whether Pan Ocean's lack of registration under the NIPC Act robs this Tribunal of jurisdiction. Below, the Tribunal dismisses these objections because, as envisioned within Section 31 of the NIPC Act's definition of \"enterprise\" to which the NIPC Act applies, the context requires it. Sections 31 and 20 of the NIPC Act states in relevant part:132\n\n31. Interpretation\n\nIn this Act, unless the context otherwise requires \u2013\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\"enterprise\" means an industry, project, undertaking or business to which this Act applies or an expansion of that industry, undertaking, project or business or any part of that industry, undertaking, project or business and, where there is foreign participation, means such an enterprise duly registered with the Commission; [\u2026]\n\n20. Registration of enterprise with the Commission\n\n(1) An enterprise in which foreign participation is permitted under section 17 of this Act shall, before commencing business, apply to the Commission for registration. [\u2026]\n\nNigerian Investment Promotion Commission Act (NIPC Act), Chapter N117 of Decree No. 16, 16 January 1995, Exhibit R-1(f).\n\n133.\n\nRespondent argues that Sections 20 and 31 of the NIPC Act, which evidence the obligation to register, limit the consent to arbitration under Section 26 of the NIPC Act to those enterprises with foreign participation that have been registered with the NIPC. Respondent states that Pan Ocean is not registered with the NIPC and is, therefore, not \"qualified for protection\" under the NIPC Act.133 Respondent argues that Claimants bore the responsibility of ensuring that Pan Ocean was registered during the 3-year registration period, from 1995 \u2013 1998 (during Dr. Fabbri's lifetime).134\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6 85.\n\n134.\n\nAccording to Claimants, even if there had been no registration, Dr. Fabbri or the owners could have applied to register Pan Ocean during the three-year grandfathering period. Had they done so the business would have been registered.135\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 14, 30.\n\n135.\n\nIn the context of the present dispute, a lack of registration would not necessarily preclude the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction. The current claims relate to Respondent's alleged failure to protect Claimants' investment in Nigeria in the circumstances of attempts by Dr. Fadeyi, Managing Director of Pan Ocean, to wrest control of that company from its rightful owners.136\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6 124.\n\n136.\n\nIn this context, it would be both unfair and illogical to decline jurisdiction on the basis of a lack of registration. Here, the person responsible for failure of registration remains the same person accused of orchestrating an expropriation.137 An alleged wrongdoer's behavior would not normally nullify arbitral jurisdiction.\n\nJustice Torgbor does not share this finding for dismissing Respondent's objection to jurisdiction in the context of circumstances relating to Dr. Fadeyi's attempts to wrest control of Pan Ocean from Claimants for the following reasons:  \n(i) This restatement of the Parties' dispute in paragraph 135 differs from its accurate statement in paragraphs 130 and 132 above.  \n(ii) The jurisdictional objection is raised not by Dr. Fadeyi the alleged wrongdoer but by Respondent exculpated from wrong doing (paragraphs 296, 297, 310, 315, 323 and 332 below).  \n(iii) As the factual context in paragraphs 135 and 136 of the award for dismissing the objection relates to Dr. Fadeyi and not Respondent, and Respondent was neither responsible for Fadeyi's wrongdoing nor for registering Pan Ocean or Claimants, the factual context for dismissing this jurisdictional objection with reference to Dr. Fadeyi's wrongdoing is not the statutory context envisaged by section 31 NIPC Act for determining the legal effect of non-registration of Pan Ocean.  \n(iv) The Claimants' admission of lack of registration under Section 26(3) NIPC Act disables them from properly accepting the offer to arbitrate under the Act (Respondent's Submission para 108 and Counter-memorial para 179).\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, dismisses this objection to jurisdiction related to a lack of registration, and all claims and sub-claims related thereto, listed above in this section, are also dismissed.138\n\nJustice Torgbor differs from this conclusion for same reasons stated in footnote 135 above.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered Respondent's argument that Claimants' case should be dismissed, as a punitive measure, for Claimants' alleged intentional misleading of the ICSID Secretariat into registering the RfA.139\n\nRespondent's Reply \u00b6 9.\n\n139.\n\nRespondent has provided no basis in law for such sanction. Further, there is no evidence of any intent on the part of Claimants to mislead the ICSID Secretariat concerning Claimants' registration with NIPC. The Tribunal, therefore, declines to refuse jurisdiction on that basis and makes no finding on whether Claimants have intentionally misled the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n(3) Premature Filing\n--------------------\n\na. The Parties' Positions\n-------------------------\n\ni. Respondent's Objection\n-------------------------\n\n140.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants did not comply with the preconditions to arbitration contained in in Section 26 of the NIPC Act, which prevents them from commencing arbitration in accordance with Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act.\n\n141.\n\nFirst, contrary to what Claimants allege, there is no evidence of a scheduled meeting with the Managing Director of the NNPC in November 2004. Regardless, such a meeting would not be relevant because the purported purpose of the meeting was not to settle a dispute with Respondent.140 Respondent rejects Claimants' contention that Respondent refused to meet with Claimants' representatives about the dispute in 2004.141\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 256-257.\n\nRespondent's Reply \u00b6 70.\n\n142.\n\nRespondent urges the Tribunal to reject tracking reports purportedly evidencing delivery because those documents were not timely filed, and Claimants did not seek leave to introduce them into evidence.142 Respondent also argues that (i) there is no evidence that the Minister of Petroleum Resources received the letters, (ii) Claimants have not evidenced that the recipients identified in the tracking reports were officials of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, and (iii) there is no record of the tracking reports on the websites of the corresponding courier companies.143 Moreover, the letters allegedly sent between 9 October 2012 and 3 May 2013 were never received by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and, regardless, should have been addressed to the Attorney-General. These letters cannot evidence Claimants' fulfilment of the requirement to seek amicable settlement.144\n\nLetter from Respondent to the Tribunal received on 1 August 2014 responding to Claimants' correspondence to the Tribunal received on 30 July 2014.\n\n*Id.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 260-268, 272; see also Letter from Respondent to the Tribunal received on 1 August 2014 responding to Claimants' correspondence to the Tribunal received on 30 July 2014.\n\n143.\n\nSecond, Section 26(3) also imposes a separate requirement that the investor is only entitled to resort to ICSID arbitration and the applicability of the ICSID Rules as a default position, in the event of a dispute as to the method of dispute settlement to be adopted.145 As recognized by Claimants as a condition precedent in their Points of Claim, there was no such disagreement in this case.146\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 123; Respondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 254.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 124.\n\n144.\n\nThird, Claimants made no attempt to amicably settle the dispute with Respondent as required by Section 26(1) of the NIPC Act. The requirement to attempt to reach an amicable settlement constitutes a condition precedent to the institution of arbitration proceedings.147 Section 26(2) should be interpreted as establishing that disputes may be submitted to arbitration only when the obligation set out in Section 26(1) has been fulfilled.148 The purpose of this precondition would be to give the parties the opportunity to address the dispute, engage in good faith negotiations, and implement the internal processes to do so.149 Respondent urges the Tribunal to reject Claimants' contention that the requirement should not be interpreted as mandatory because, unlike other preconditions, it does not textually impose a \"cooling-off\" or waiting period.150\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 242.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 246, 253.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 202, 204.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 195.\n\nii. Claimants' Position\n-----------------------\n\n145.\n\nClaimants argue that they have fully complied with the requirements under Section 26 and were within their rights to commence this arbitration.\n\n146.\n\nRespondent had knowledge of the dispute, and Claimants notified Respondent of the dispute orally and in writing on numerous occasions. Claimants refer to four letters from Claimants' counsel to the Nigerian Minister of Petroleum Resources that were exhibited with the RfA as evidence.151 To evidence that these letters were received by Respondent, Claimants rely on the formal tracking reports from the associated courier companies.152 Claimants submitted the delivery invoices issued by the courier companies153 as well as evidence refuting Respondent's argument that there is no record of the tracking reports on the websites of the courier companies.154\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections \u00b6 63; See e.g., Annexures 1-4 to the RfA.\n\nAppendix A to Claimants' Response to Respondents' First Memorial, pp. 14-15. C-60 to C-63.\n\nC-60 to C-63.\n\nWS of Jacques Jones \u00b6\u00b6 67-69\n\n147.\n\nConcerning the requirement to seek amicable settlement, Section 26 of the NIPC Act should not be interpreted as a mandatory jurisdictional precondition.155 Unlike other statutes, this provision does not contain preconditions such as \"cooling-off\" or waiting periods for commencing arbitration, which are commonly imposed in the event a settlement is not reached. Moreover, even when these preconditions are imposed, they are interpreted by tribunals as \"procedural and directory [rather than] mandatory and jurisdictional.\"156\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 40, 45.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 41-44.\n\n148.\n\nClaimants contend that, since they lost control over Pan Ocean, they made genuine attempts to reach an amicable settlement with Respondent.157 They allege that in 2004 representatives of their interests scheduled a meeting with an advisor on petroleum matters to the then-President of Nigeria to seek a settlement of the dispute. According to Claimants, the Presidential advisor subsequently refused to meet with Claimants' representatives, who had traveled from Geneva to Abuja for the meeting.158 Furthermore, Claimants' attorneys wrote two letters in October 2012 and one in March 2013 to the Minister for Petroleum Resources, exposing the issues encountered in relation to their investment and demanding resolution of their claims, which remained unanswered.159 Claimants state that they had requested *inter alia* the statement of affairs of the NNPC / Pan Ocean joint venture, including the volume of production for the preceding ten years, and had demanded that Respondent (through NNPC) desist from dealing with Dr. Fadeyi and his associates and refuse to give assent to any interest(s) other than that of Claimants in relation to the 40% participating interest in OML 98.160\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 10.7; Claimants' Reply \u00b6 47.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 14.1, 14.2.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 14.1, 14.2.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 14.2.\n\nb. The Tribunal's Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n149.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether amicable settlement discussions are a pre-condition to bringing arbitration proceedings under Section 26(1) of the NIPC Act.\n\n150.\n\nThe factual record indicates that Claimants did seek amicable settlement of this dispute in 2012 and 2013, after Mrs. Timolini yielded her interest to Dr. Fabbri's estate. Claimants cannot be faulted for Respondent having ignored these communications. Thus, to the extent that any requirement may exist, Claimants have fulfilled it.161\n\nJustice Torgbor is persuaded by the uncontroverted factual evidence that the dispute had been ongoing for years prior to the filing of this claim in July 2013 (paragraph 151 below), but with no clear evidence of the opportunities offered by one Party and rejected by the other for amicable settlement, if that \"Other Party\" is the Respondent, as distinct from Dr. Fadeyi.\n\n151.\n\nThe dispute had been ongoing for years prior to Claimants' filing of this claim in July 2013, and the Parties have had every opportunity to attempt to resolve this dispute.162\n\nJustice Torgbor accepts the evidence that the Claimants have litigated the dispute and activated sub-judice principles that prevented the NNPC and the Minister of Petroleum to act as the Claimants wished. Professor Omorogbe, Claimants' expert witness evidence was that court actions would bar executive intervention and out of court interventions (paragraph 329 below, and Continued Hearing Transcript Day 1, 301:19-22).\n\n152.\n\nGiven the history of this matter, including the procedural history in this arbitration, it is unlikely that further attempts at amicable settlement would have succeeded. Respondent's failure to reply to Claimants' correspondence forms part of the disputed merits in this arbitration. Claimants alleged that Respondent failed to protect their investment and/or conspired to deprive Claimants of their investment.163 The Tribunal cannot deny jurisdiction in circumstances where one party appears to have been unwilling to entertain settlement or where further attempts may have been futile.164\n\nSee *infra* paragraphs 323-332.\n\nJustice Torgbor is persuaded by the uncontroverted evidence that Claimants themselves prevented their cases from proceeding by discontinuing one, withdrawing an appeal, serially amending their filings and making an incompetent application (paragraph 330 below). There is no evidence of a meeting in November 2004, between Claimants and Respondent or of the Respondent's refusal to negotiate an amicable settlement. Claimants' invocation of the NNPC Act and ICSID Rules is therefore not supported by their non-fulfillment of the requirements of those instruments.\n\n153.\n\nNext, the Tribunal considers whether there must be disagreement between the investor and Respondent over the mode of dispute resolution in order for the ICSID Rules to become applicable under Article 26(3) of the NIPC Act.165 This text is provided below:\n\n(3) Where in respect of a dispute, there is disagreement between the investor and the Federal Government as to the method of dispute settlement to be adopted, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes Rules shall apply.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 121.\n\n154.\n\nIn Claimants' RfA, Claimants inserted the text \"or inability to agree\" in parentheses following \"disagreement\", to reflect the *de facto* position at the time of filing the RfA, referring to a lack of consensus.166 Respondent has argued that these two terms connote different factual situations and that, owing to the absence of a disagreement (based on there having been no opportunity to disagree), the ICSID Rules cannot apply.167 The Tribunal does not regard this as an attempt to mislead ICSID into registering the RfA.168 Further, having found that the filing of the RfA was not premature, Claimants cannot be faulted for any alleged failure to \"attempt to agree on a dispute resolution mechanism\", as argued by Respondent. The Tribunal agrees that this invocation of the ICSID Rules was proper.169\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6 129.\n\n*Compare*, Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n\nJustice Torgbor differs from this conclusion because of Claimants' own admission that they were not registered at the date of registering their RfA.\n\n(4) Scope of the NIPC Act\n-------------------------\n\na. The Parties' Positions\n-------------------------\n\ni. Respondent's Objections\n--------------------------\n\n155.\n\nRespondent contends that even if the Tribunal were to find that Claimants had accepted the standing offer to arbitrate, their claims for indirect expropriation and violations of customary international law fall outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction because they are not encompassed by Respondent's consent to arbitration contained in Section 26 of the NIPC Act.170\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 274; Respondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 214-220.\n\n156.\n\nTribunals must verify whether the scope of consent is restricted in any way. In the present case, consent is limited to the protections offered by the NIPC Act, which are exhaustively listed in its Sections 24 and 25.171 Section 25 of the NIPC Act does not provide protection against both direct and indirect expropriation.172 According to Respondent, \"Section 25 provides for protection against direct expropriation only. The provision does not expressly refer to indirect expropriation. Nor does it contain any of the language normally interpreted as implicitly covering indirect expropriation. In particular, it does not refer to 'measures equivalent to expropriation', a term which tribunals commonly understand to denote indirect expropriation.\"173 Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act does not refer to indirect expropriation, but rather to \"circumstances of compelled transfer of assets\",174 which would not be relevant in the present case because Claimants remain in full possession of their original shareholding in Pan Ocean.175\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 279.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 282.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 283.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 210.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 20.\n\n157.\n\nThe alleged violations of customary international law are excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction because they cannot be considered as claims under the NIPC Act. According to Respondent, \"[t]here is neither explicit nor implicit language in the NIPC Act that expands the Act's protection or its dispute resolution clause to breaches of customary international law.\"176 Respondent rejects any interpretation of consent under the NIPC Act as including disputes related to all breaches of Nigerian law, and states that, in any event, it was not established that customary international law is part of Nigerian law.177 Moreover, there are no applicable bilateral or multilateral agreements to which Nigeria and the United States are parties that would contain other substantive protections.178 Respondent also contends that Claimants cannot rely on Article 42 of ICSID Convention to broaden the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction to include claims based on customary international law, because Article 42 only concerns the rules applicable to the decision on the merits.179\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 293.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 222-223.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 228.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 300, 303.\n\n158.\n\nIn addition, Claimants' points of claim referring to the alleged unlawful detention of Mr. Rooks and others would fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction both *ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis* because the alleged events took place in 1987, and thus pre-date the enactment of the NIPC Act.180\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 238.\n\nii. Claimants' Position\n-----------------------\n\n159.\n\nClaimants urge the Tribunal to decline to hear this belated jurisdictional objection and, in the alternative, request that the Tribunal join its discussion and consideration to the merits phase.181\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 24-33.\n\n160.\n\nClaimants contend that the allegations of indirect expropriation fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act, establishing that no person owning a capital of an enterprise should be compelled \"by law\" to surrender his interest in the capital to \"any other person\", provides for protection against indirect expropriation.182 They also contend that it would be possible to rely on Section 25(1)(a) of the Act.183 Protections against expropriation would be frustrated if forms of indirect expropriation were excluded from the prohibition on such acts.184\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 69.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 54, 55.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 53.\n\n161.\n\nClaimants assert that through *inter alia* the decisions of Respondent's judiciary, they were indeed compelled to surrender their interest in Pan Ocean to Dr. Fadeyi and his associates.185\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 54.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal has jurisdiction over claims based on international customary law. First, according to Claimants, the present case should be distinguished from *Tradex v. Albania*, on which Respondent relies, because Section 26 of the NIPC Act is not as narrowly phrased as the dispute resolution clause examined in *Tradex*.186 Second, the broad formulation of Section 26 of the NIPC Act, which also makes reference to disputes based on bilateral and multilateral agreements, would imply that \"breaches of international law are admissible.\"187 Moreover, \"by their very nature, the allegations against the State of denial of justice as a result of the actions of the State's courts give rise to a liability / State responsibility in customary international law.\"188 Finally, customary international law is part of Nigerian law, because Section 32 of the Interpretation Act integrated into the Nigerian legal system the English common law, and the latter includes customary international law.189\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 58-61, citing *Tradex Hellas S.A. v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2, Award, 29 April 1999, Legal Authority RL-61.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 62, 65.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 63.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 66.\n\nb. The Tribunal's Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Respondent's contention that indirect expropriation and protections afforded under customary international law are excluded from the protection offered under the NIPC Act. As indicated in Professor Oditah's report, there is nothing in the NIPC Act to indicate that indirect or creeping expropriation is excluded from its scope, and such a narrow and limited interpretation is unwarranted. Indeed, as argued, \"it cannot have been the intention of the Respondent to accord the investor important safeguards with the one hand but then take them away with the other by permitting the same catastrophic state of affairs to be accomplished indirectly [\u2026].\"190\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 11.\n\n164.\n\nRespondent's contention that, pursuant to Section 26(1) of the NIPC Act, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over claims based on customary international law must be rejected. The broadly drafted language in Section 26 of the NIPC Act includes claims under customary international law.\n\n\"26. Dispute settlement procedures\n\n(1) Where a dispute arises between an investor an any Government of the Federation in respect of an enterprise, all efforts shall be made through mutual discussion to reach an amicable settlement.\n\n(2) Any dispute between an investor and any Government of the Federation in respect of an enterprise to which this Act applies which is not amicably settled through mutual discussions, may be submitted at the option of the aggrieved party to arbitration as follows\u2014\n\n(a) In the case of a Nigerian investor, in accordance with the rules of procedure for arbitration as specified in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act; or\n\n(b) In the case of a foreign investor, within the framework of any bilateral or multilateral agreement on investment protection to which the Federal Government and the country of which the investor is a national are parties; or\n\n(c) In accordance with any other national or international machinery for the settlement of investment disputes agreed on by the parties.\n\n(3) Where in respect of a dispute, there is disagreement between the investor and the Federal Government as to the method of dispute settlement to be adopted, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes Rules shall apply.\"\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that customary international law is part of the English common law and that common law has been incorporated into Nigerian law by Section 32 of the Nigerian Interpretation Act.191 Thus customary international law has become part of Nigerian law, applicable by Nigerian courts to the same extent as is common law. In this context, Claimants' claims under international law are properly before this Tribunal.\n\nSee Second Expert Report of Professor Fidelis Oditah in \u00b6 33, opining English law was accepted into Nigerian law by Section 32 of the Nigerian Interpretation Act 1964, to the extent that it is not inconsistent with Nigeria legislation, as confirmed in the Nigerian Supreme Court decision in *Ibidapo v. Lufthansa Airlines*. The Second Expert Report of Justice Emmanuel Ayoola (at \u00b6\u00b6 150-156) appears less forceful on this point, accepting that English law becomes part of Nigerian law until changed by Nigerian legislation, but questioning whether that principle extends to customary international law until the Nigerian Supreme Court so decides.\n\n(5) Attribution to Respondent of Harm-Causing Acts\n--------------------------------------------------\n\na. The Parties' Positions\n-------------------------\n\ni. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n166.\n\nRespondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to the extent that the alleged acts of Dr. Fadeyi, even if causing damage to Claimants, were not attributable to Respondent.192\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 321, 328.\n\n167.\n\nSection 25 of the NIPC Act does not protect against expropriation \"by any person\", as suggested by Claimants, but rather \"by any Government of the Federation.\"193 Thus, in order to apply the provision, the acts of private individuals must be attributable to the State.194\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 322.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 326-327.\n\n168.\n\nClaimants failed to prove that Dr. Fadeyi's actions are \"attributable to Respondent\" within the meaning of international law on state responsibility,195 nor have they shown that they were victims of \"miscarriage of justice or denial of due process\" in relation to the court proceedings in which they challenged Dr. Fadeyi's actions.196 Furthermore, several acts that allegedly caused damages to Claimants only could have been undertaken by Pan Ocean's representatives, and not by Respondent's representatives.197\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 330-332.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 332-335.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 329.\n\n169.\n\nSimply put, Dr. Fadeyi's acts are not attributable to Respondent and Claimants have not shown that he acted as an agent of Respondent.198 None of the principles codified in the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ILC Articles\") would be applicable in this case.199 First, Dr. Fadeyi was not an \"organ\" of Respondent nor was he part of the \"organization\" of Respondent, as required by ILC Article 4.200 Second, his actions were not \"related to the exercise of governmental authority\", nor was he empowered by Nigerian law to exercise elements of governmental authority within the meaning of ILC Article 5.201 Finally, Claimants failed to prove that Dr. Fadeyi was acting as an agent or \"on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of\" Respondent, as required by ILC Article 8.202\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 248, citing Claimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 137, 142.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 248-249.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 251-252.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 253-256.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 257.\n\n170.\n\nPan Ocean's role as \"Operator\" of the joint venture in charge of the day-to-day conduct of operation does not entail that Dr. Fadeyi represented Respondent in the joint venture.203 Even assuming that it was the case, the representation would not go beyond the scope of Pan Ocean's role as Operator, and thus would not extend to the private dispute over Pan Ocean's management and control, which involves acts that do not pertain to the joint venture's authority.204 Moreover, the joint venture exercises a commercial activity, which cannot be considered an exercise of \"governmental authority.\"205\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 260.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 261, 263.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 262.\n\n171.\n\nIn principle, state-controlled entities are considered as separate from the state, unless they exercise elements of governmental authority within the meaning of ILC Article 5.206 The NNPC's operation and its role and powers as described in the Nigerian legislation confirm that the NNPC is a commercial entity that only engages in \"private or commercial\" activities.207 The alleged violations of Claimants' rights by the NNPC would, therefore, not be attributable to Respondent.208\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 338, 339.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 340-344.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 344.\n\nii. Claimants' Position\n-----------------------\n\n172.\n\nClaimants contend that relevant alleged acts were indeed attributable to Respondent.\n\n173.\n\nFirst, the expression \"by law\" in Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act refers to both legislative acts and decisions by national courts.209 Courts are organs of the state within the meaning of ILC Article 4, and their acts are attributable to the state even when unlawful or contrary to instructions (according to ILC Article 7).210 The decision of the Federal High Court of Abuja in the \"2005 case\" is therefore attributable to Respondent.211\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 70.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 70, 132.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 69.\n\n174.\n\nSecond, Claimants contend that certain actions of Dr. Fadeyi are attributable to Respondent and engage its responsibility.212 According to Claimants, since Pan Ocean is the \"Operator\" of OML 98, Dr. Fadeyi, as representative of Pan Ocean, also acted as a representative of the NNPC/POOC joint venture.213 For Claimants, \"Dr. Festu Fadeyi's refusal to respond to the Claimants' demands to restore control of the operator company [and] to provide joint operation financial information to Claimants was an act attributable to the State.\"214\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 137.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 137-139.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 142.\n\n175.\n\nFinally, both the NNPC and Ministry of Petroleum Resources failed to protect Claimants' rights, thus triggering State responsibility.215 The NNPC is not merely a private entity or commercial partner, as argued by Respondent, but rather a representative of Respondent in the petroleum sector.216 The NNPC is a statutory entity that is owned and controlled by Respondent, and has the Minister of Petroleum as Chairman of the Board.217 The long title of the NNPC Act states that the NNPC is \"empowered to engage in all commercial activities relating to the petroleum industry and to enforce all regulatory measure[s] to the general control of the petroleum sector through its petroleum inspectorate department.\"218 Claimants contend that the NNPC acted as an organ of the State, which had the duty to protect Claimants,219 and for the purpose of attribution, it is irrelevant whether the conduct of an organ of the State is classified as \"commercial\" or \"*acta jure gestionis.*\"220\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 73.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 134(i).\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 134(ii).\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 134(i).\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 134(iii).\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 131, citing James Crawford, The International Law Commissions Articles on State Responsibility (2002), p. 94.\n\nb. The Tribunal's Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal can have no jurisdiction over harms that are not attributable to Respondent. As the Parties have also recognized, however, that analysis is based on the context of each event. In the section on liability *infra*, the Tribunal's presents its analysis of whether the alleged harms should be considered attributable to Respondent.\n\n(6) Further Jurisdictional Objections\n-------------------------------------\n\na. The Tribunal's Invitation for a List of Issues\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nOn 14 May 2018, in Procedural Order No. 8, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consider submitting a joint list of issues, with each side submitting its own list if agreement proved elusive. Following an exchange which included exchanges between the Parties on 13 June 2018, an email to ICSID from Claimants on 19 June 2018, and a letter to ICSID from Respondent on 29 June 2018, no lists were submitted until 18 January 2019, when Claimants submitted a list.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal renewed its invitation to Respondent to provide a list of its own, or to at least comment on the list of issues submitted by Claimants. On 4 February 2019, Respondent (through its representatives at the firm of Afe Babalola & Co, in a letter signed by Oluwasina Ogungbade, Esq.) declined to comment on Claimants' list of issues, or to provide any list of issues from Respondent itself. That letter of 4 February 2019 stated *inter alia* that \"it is not for the Respondent to undertake the work of the Tribunal.\" The letter continued with citation to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention (providing for awards to deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal) and an admonition to the Tribunal on how its failures to consider all issues might result in an \"annullable error\" under Article 52(1) which relates *inter alia* to corruption, fundamental rules of procedure, and failure for an award to state reasons.\n\n179.\n\nFor the sake of good order, the Tribunal on 3 June 2019 confirmed through the Tribunal Secretary that it had given Respondent an invitation to confirm its list of issues, and continued that the Tribunal \"would welcome a List from the Respondent should it now decide to submit one.\" No list was forthcoming.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal has been cautious to ascertain that no jurisdictional objection has been overlooked. In reviewing the Parties' submissions for additional matters that might be characterized as jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal has identified the following two items that arguably contained jurisdictional arguments, addressed below: one related to Mr. Rooks and the other related to the nature of international law. For the avoidance of doubt, these will be addressed here in connection with jurisdiction.\n\nb. The Alleged Detention of Mr. Rooks\n-------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nClaimants have submitted that the alleged unlawful detention of Mr. Rooks is an event that formed part of the alleged \"creeping expropriation\" of their investment.221 Claimants have stated that the arrest and detention was a breach of the duty to provide full protection and security under customary law to the foreign investor and its employees.222\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 134(v).\n\n182.\n\nRespondent does not admit that Mr. Rooks was detained in 1987. Respondent has alleged that Claimants' allegations in connection with the detention of Mr. Rooks and others fall outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* (taking place in 1987, 8 years before the NIPC Act).223 Those actions, even if established, could not constitute a breach of the NIPC Act, which was not in force at the time. Further, the alleged detention appears to be irrelevant to Claimants' claims in this arbitration.224\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 304, 461.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 136-139.\n\n183.\n\nRespondent further states that Claimants have not requested that the Tribunal provide a declaration that Respondent failed to provide full protection and security to Claimants' investments. Claimants never provided any rebuttal to Respondent's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Claimants' claim regarding Mr. Rooks's detention. Claimants' customary law claims are, therefore, beyond the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.225\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 236-237.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal found that it has jurisdiction over Claimants' international law claims against Respondent, without temporal restriction. The alleged detention of Mr. Rooks formed part of Claimants' allegations against Respondent. As indicated *infra*, the Tribunal has found that Respondent bears no liability in respect of Claimants' allegations. The Tribunal, therefore, need not further delineate what jurisdiction, if any, it would have to resolve other claims regarding Mr. Rooks.226\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial footnote 448.\n\nc. Nature of International Law\n------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nIn addition to Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Claimants' claims based on customary international law, which the Tribunal has addressed *supra*, Respondent has asked whether (i) fair and equitable treatment, (ii) full protection and security, and (iii) denial of justice are standalone protections under customary international law.227 Respondent has asked whether Claimants' claims under customary international law must be limited to the minimum standard of treatment.228\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 432; Respondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 334, 347.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 247; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 67.\n\n186.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that under either interpretation of the scope and extent of that customary law, the result of this award would be the same. The Tribunal does not find a breach of customary international law. The alleged wrongdoings are not attributable to Respondent or do not form part of a concerted effort involving Respondent to deprive Claimants of their investment. This is true regardless of whether one examines the cited standards as protections which standalone under customary international law. Consequently, the Tribunal need not speculate in the form of *dictum* on the matter, given that Claimants' claims fail under either interpretation of scope of international law, as discussed *infra*.\n\n**V. Liability and Damages**\n----------------------------\n\n**A.** ***Overview***\n---------------------\n\n187.\n\nClaimants allege that their investment in Nigeria has suffered difficulties since at least 1987, when Respondent detained Mr. Rooks, one of their employees, for 5 months for reasons disputed by the Parties. In 1998, the ultimate owner of Claimants' investment, Dr. Fabbri, died intestate and, according to Claimants, Dr. Fadeyi, the manager of Pan Ocean, seized on the opportunity to steal the company. This alleged theft was later validated by Nigerian Courts.\n\n188.\n\nClaimants allege that entities and individuals whose acts are attributable to Respondent contributed to the illegal dilution and seizure of Claimants' shareholding and control over Pan Ocean, and thus of the 40% participating interest in OML 98 and OPL 275, through a series of acts and omissions in violation of Claimants' rights.229 As a consequence of this conduct, Claimants have suffered a total loss of their investment and have been unable to receive profits and dividends, which has resulted in in a total loss of their investment.230\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 9.3.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 9.5, 9.7, 10.6.\n\n189.\n\nClaimants contend that these acts and omissions are attributable to Respondent, which failed to protect Claimants from adverse control of its 40% interest in OML 98 and OPL 275. They argue that this failure constitutes violations of the provisions of the NIPC Act providing for protections for foreign investors. Further or in the alternative, Claimants contend that Respondent violated its duties and obligations under customary international law.231\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1.8-1.10.\n\n190.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants failed to demonstrate any violation of Respondent's obligations under the NIPC Act or under customary international law, as matters of fact and law.232\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 345.\n\n191.\n\nBelow, the Tribunal accepts that Claimants have been deprived of their investment in Nigeria and of Pan Ocean. This loss alone, however, does not implicate international responsibility. Rather, in order for this Tribunal to find that an expropriation has occurred, the actions alleged must be attributable to Respondent. As indicated in the Decision on Preliminary Objections (29 October 2014), if the alleged conspiracy involving Respondent is not established, Claimants will be found to have filed unfounded claims.233 The determinative factual element for whether Claimants' loss is attributable to Respondent is the existence or extent of cooperation and coordination between Respondent, its representatives and agencies, and Dr. Fadeyi in respect of his actions in relation to Pan Ocean.\n\nDecision on Preliminary Objections \u00b6 114.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimants' loss is due to breaches of Nigerian law (including customary international law) for which Respondent is responsible. Claimants have presented insufficient evidence to show that Respondent coordinated with Dr. Fadeyi to deprive Claimants of their investment. While the Tribunal can accept that Dr. Fadeyi, a long-time employee of Pan Ocean, was the beneficiary and perhaps even the architect of an alleged plan to deprive Claimants of their investment, it is Claimants' own case that it was Dr. Fadeyi who orchestrated the removal of directors and appointed new ones, including himself. He issued new shares to new shareholders, including himself, and so has reduced Claimants from sole to peripheral shareholders. No evidence demonstrates that Respondent cooperated or coordinated with Dr. Fadeyi to achieve this result. Every role that Respondent has played in Claimants' story has been independent of Dr. Fadeyi. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not find that there has been an expropriation.\n\n**B.** ***Legal Foundations to Expropriation Claims: The NIPC Act***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nThis case is not based on a treaty, but rather on a domestic investment statute, the NIPC Act. Below, the relevant provisions of the NIPC Act are summarized, followed by the Parties arguments related to the interpretation the Tribunal should give to each provision.\n\n(1) Statutory Provisions\n------------------------\n\n\"24. Investment guarantees, transfer of capital, profits and dividends\n\nSubject to this section, a foreign investor in an enterprise to which this Act applies shall be guaranteed unconditional transferability of funds through an authorized dealer, in freely convertible currency, of \u2013\n\n(a) Dividends or profits (net of taxes) attributable to the investment\n\n(b) Payments in respect of loan servicing where a foreign loan has been obtained; and\n\n(c) The remittance of proceeds (net of all taxes), and other obligations in the event of a sale or liquidation of the enterprise or any interest attributable to the investment\n\n25. Guarantees against expropriation\n\n(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section \u2013\n\n(a) no enterprise shall be nationalized or expropriated by any Government of the Federation; and\n\n(b) no person who owns, whether wholly or in part, the capital of any enterprise shall be compelled by law to surrender his interest in the capital to any other person.\n\n(2) There shall be no acquisition of an enterprise to which this Act applies by the Federal Government, unless the acquisition is in the national interest or for a public purpose and under a law which makes provision for\u2014\n\n(a) payment of fair and adequate compensation; and\n\n(b) a right of access to the courts for the determination of the investor's interest or right and the amount of compensation to which he is entitled.\n\n(3) Any compensation payable under this section shall be paid without undue delay, and authorization for its repatriation is convertible currency shall where applicable, be issued.\"\n\n(2) The Parties' Positions\n--------------------------\n\na. Claimants' Position\n----------------------\n\n194.\n\nClaimants submit that the alleged Respondent's acts and omissions amount to violations of the investors' protections provided for in Sections 24 and 25 of the NIPC Act.\n\ni. Section 25(1)(a) of the NIPC Act\n-----------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nClaimants argue that the acts and omissions attributable to Respondent \"have led to a state of affairs tantamount to expropriation, in breach of the guarantee enshrined in Section 25(1)(a) of the Act.\"234\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 10.\n\n196.\n\nPursuant to Section 25(1)(a) of the NIPC Act \"no enterprise shall be nationalised or expropriated by any Government of the Federation*.*\"235 Section 25(1)(a) encompasses forms of both direct and indirect expropriation. According to Claimants, this is confirmed by the NIPC Act's failure to expressly distinguish between the two categories, which would have been done if the intention of the Legislator was to restrict its application.236 Moreover, this broader interpretation is in line with the nature and purpose of the NIPC Act, as Respondent's intention could not have been to protect investors from direct expropriation, while permitting indirect expropriation.237\n\nNigerian Investment Promotion Commission Act, Cap 117 LFN 1995, Section 25(1)(a), Legal Authority CL-1.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 11.\n\n*Id.*\n\n197.\n\nClaimants define indirect expropriation as not involving \"physical takings\", but \"takings [\u2026] that [\u2026] permanently destroy the economic value of the investment or deprive the owner of its ability to manage, use or control its property in a meaningful way.\"238\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 10, citing UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements II, \"Expropriation: A sequel\" Chapter 1: Categories of Expropriation, Requisite Elements and Conditions of Lawfulness, p. 6, Legal Authority RL-78.\n\n198.\n\nClaimants' losses fall within the notion of \"creeping expropriation\", a subcategory of expropriation that \"results in a deprivation of property or a loss of control but which occurs gradually or in stages\u2026 it encapsulates the situation whereby a series of acts attributable to the State over a period of time culminate in the expropriatory taking of such property*.*\"239 Claimants also rely on the definition provided in *Metalclad v. Mexico*, which includes \"[\u2026] covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or significant part, of the use or reasonably to be expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State*.*\"240\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 12, citing UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements II, \"Expropriation: A sequel\" Chapter 1: Categories of Expropriation, Requisite Elements and Conditions of Lawfulness, p. 8, Legal Authority RL-78.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 104, citing *Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)97/1, Award, 30 August 2000, \u00b6 103, Legal Authority RL-58.\n\n199.\n\nClaimants conclude that these definitions describe the gradual erosion or deprivation of their legal rights and the losses suffered.241 The fact that there was not an actual \"seizure\", and that the investment was not transferred to the State but to a third party, is irrelevant.242 Contrary to what Respondent argues, Claimants' claims are not simply about a dispute between private parties, because the loss of Claimants' investment would have not occurred without Respondent's acts and omissions, which have thus caused the loss or contributed to it.243\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 13.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\nii. Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act\n------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nSection 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act provides that \"no person who owns, whether wholly or in part, the capital of any enterprise shall be compelled by law to surrender his interest in the capital to any other person.\"244 According to Claimants, this provision encompasses \"judicial expropriation\", and would therefore be triggered by the 2005 and 2006 decisions of the Federal High Court of Abuja.245\n\nNigerian Investment Promotion Commission Act, Cap 117 LFN 1995, Section 25(1)(b), Legal Authority CL-1.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 14.\n\n201.\n\nClaimants, relying on *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan*, argue that a court decision may amount to expropriation attributable to the State, and that \"it is a characteristic of judicial expropriation that it is usually instigated by a private party for his own benefit, and not that of the State [\u2026].\"246 According to Claimants, \"it is irrelevant that the State itself in the 2005 case did not actually take possession of Pan Ocean or the Claimants' interests in it or otherwise benefit from the taking. It lent itself to the taking by providing an unlawful and perverse mechanism by which those interests were taken thereby depriving the Claimants of their investment as if by decree. Consequently, this action by the Respondent qualifies as expropriation contrary to section 25 of NIPC Act.\"247\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 105-106, citing *Rumeli Telekom AS and Telsim Mobil Telekomuikasyon Hizmetieri A.S. v.

Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n206.\n\nRespondent argues that, even assuming that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over the expropriation claim, Claimants failed to establish that Respondent expropriated Claimants' investment, either directly or indirectly.258\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 347, 349.\n\n207.\n\nTo establish a violation of Section 25 of the NIPC Act, Claimants should prove that Respondent: (i) \"nationalised or expropriated Pan Ocean\", as required by Section 25(1)(a) of the Act; or (ii) \"compelled [the Claimants] by law to surrender [their] interest in [Pan Ocean] to any another person\", as required by Section 25(1)(b) of the Act.259\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 349.\n\ni. Section 25(1)(a) of the NIPC Act\n-----------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nRespondent argues that Pan Ocean was neither nationalized nor expropriated. First, Respondent's alleged conduct clearly do not amount to nationalization, which can be defined as \"large-scale takings of private property in all economic sectors, in an industry or on a sector-specific basis\" generally motivated by policy considerations, nor did Claimants attempt to suggest that.260 Second, Respondent states that expropriations, as \"property-specific or enterprise-specific takings\", can be divided in two categories: direct and indirect.261\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 352.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 353.\n\n209.\n\nAs mentioned above, Respondent argues that only direct expropriation is covered by the NIPC Act.262 However, Respondent submits that, in any event, Claimants' claims based on either direct or indirect expropriation, as well as their arguments on \"judicial expropriation\", are meritless.263\n\n*Id.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 243-245.\n\n210.\n\nWith respect to direct expropriation, Respondent argues that it is well established in the jurisprudence of international arbitration tribunals that direct expropriation requires \"mandatory legal transfer of the title to the property or its outright physical seizure by the State itself or by a State entity.\"264 Respondent contends that it is undisputed that it has not legally or physically seized Claimants' investment, as it did not take possession of Pan Ocean.265 Moreover, it states that Claimants: (i) did not lose legal title of their investment, as they still own the shares in Pan Ocean; (ii) did not hold a direct interest in the Joint Venture or its assets; and (iii) cannot claim that they were deprived of a right to 100% of Pan Ocean's participating interest because \"they never assumed more than 25% of the exposure or financial risk in Pan Ocean.\"266\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 353-354; Rejoinder \u00b6 270, citing *LG&E Energy Corp. et al. v.

Moreover, Respondent argues that Claimants were simply unable to defend their claims in a private dispute, but did not provide evidence of any measure that would amount to an indirect \"taking\" of their rights, for the purpose of establishing indirect expropriation.285\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 378; Respondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 281-284.\n\n*Id.*\n\n220.\n\nRegarding the allegations of \"judicial expropriation\", Respondent contends that, since Claimants were unable to substantiate their claims based on the notion of indirect expropriation, they relied on the \"unsound notion\" of \"judicial expropriation.\"286\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 285-287.\n\n221.\n\nRespondent argues that, under both domestic law and international law, decisions of domestic courts on allocation of rights cannot qualify as \"takings\" amounting to expropriation.287 At the international level, a sanction against a domestic judicial decision could only be obtained if it amounts to a \"denial of justice\", i.e. to a \"[m]anifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety.\"288 Otherwise, international tribunals would become courts of appeal for domestic decisions that claimants disagree with.289\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 288, citing *Robert Azinian et al. v.

Respondent suggests that they relied on this theory because they did not exhaust local remedies, which is required to establish a claim of denial of justice, and because the NIPC Act only provides for protection against direct expropriation and free transfer of capital, and does not extend to violations of customary international law, including \"denial of justice.\"290\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 290-292.\n\n223.\n\nRespondent argues that the court's decisions in 2005 and 2006, which authorized Pan Ocean's board meeting and the subsequent allotment of shares, were \"procedurally just and reasonable in the circumstances\" and that, in any event, Claimants failed to pursue the available judicial recourses to challenge them.291 Moreover, it stresses that those decisions did not extinguish any of their rights.292\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 294-295.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 296.\n\n224.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that Claimants relied on *Saipem* and other decisions that can be characterized as \"disguised denial of justice decisions.\"293 Moreover, according to Respondent, some of the decisions mentioned by Claimants, such as *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan* and *Sistem v. Kyrgyz Republic*, should be distinguished from the present case because they \"involved seriously egregious conduct on the part of the State that manifested itself in a Court decision. In this sense, they are less about expropriation by the judiciary than expropriation by the executive.\"294 Respondent contends that there is no evidence of such \"egregious conduct\" by the executive, as the court's decisions were independent and taken in good faith, and Respondent did not even play a part in bringing the matter before the court.295\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 288, 289, 304.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 301-302.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 303.\n\nii. Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act\n------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nRespondent contends that it did not operate any transfer of shares within the meaning of Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act, nor did it acquiesce or participate in the alleged dilution of shares or surrender of interest operated by Dr. Fadeyi, a private individual.296\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 379-382.\n\n226.\n\nMoreover, Respondent argues that it cannot be held responsible for Claimants' lack of success in this dispute, which has been litigated for over a decade before Nigerian courts, given that Respondent was never a party to the proceedings (except for the incidental naming of the CAC), and it would have been inappropriate for it to interfere with those proceedings.297 Finally, according to Respondent, Claimants failed to prove that they were treated unfairly by Nigerian courts.298\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 382-383.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 383.\n\n227.\n\nRespondent concludes that Claimants failed to establish any violation of Section 25 of the NIPC Act.299 Furthermore, if they wanted to establish their expropriation claim, Claimants would have also had to prove that the alleged measures failed to comply with Section 25(2) of the NIPC Act, which provides for rights to adequate compensation and access to courts in case of expropriation for national interest or for a public purpose.300 However, Claimants did not present arguments on this point.301\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 384.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 350, 351.\n\n*Id.*\n\n228.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' argument that the decisions of the Federal High Court of Abuja in the \"2005 Board Meeting Case\" would also constitute a denial of justice. According to Respondent, this claim should be dismissed because: (i) Claimants failed to \"demonstrate that the decisions they complain of were criticisable either from a procedural or a substantive point of view, let alone that they amount to an outrage, bad faith or wilful neglect of duty\", thus failing to meet the threshold for a finding of denial of justice; and (ii) Claimants failed to exhaust local remedies in Nigeria.302\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 311.\n\n229.\n\nFirst, Respondent contends that the standard of proof to establish a denial of justice is high. Respondent refers to different case-law definitions according to which a finding of denial of justice requires evidence of an act of the judiciary \"bereft of a basis in law\", or amounting to \"an outrage, bad faith, wilful neglect of duty, or insufficiency of actions apparent to any unbiased man\", or to a \"[m]anifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety.\"303 Moreover, Respondent states that the possibility that courts of another jurisdiction would have held otherwise is irrelevant to this kind of claim.304 Respondent stresses that, as Claimants seem to be aware of, \"a finding of denial of justice can only be established once the judicial system as a whole has been provided the opportunity to correct any deficiencies but has failed to do so.\"305\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 312, citing *inter alia* *The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L.

Republic of Moldova*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/23, Award, 8 April 2013, \u00b6 453, original Exhibit C-160, renumbered Legal Authority CL-69: \"(not finding a denial of justice, although 'that the first decision of the Economic Circuit Court was extremely short and did barely go beyond the \u2013 correct \u2013 quotation of procedural norms on which it was based', *see* \u00b6 447).\"\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 315, 323.\n\n230.\n\nClaimants' arguments on denial of justice were not substantiated by evidence. On the contrary, the decisions at issue were procedurally fair and constituted reasonable applications of Nigerian law, which is also confirmed by Respondent's expert Justice Ayoola.306 Claimants thus failed to meet the high threshold for a finding of denial of justice, as they did not show evidence that Nigerian courts breached any specific law nor that the decisions at issue would amount to \"outrage, bad faith or wilful neglect of duty.\"307\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 316-319.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 61.\n\n231.\n\nSecond, Claimants did not exhaust local remedies in relation to the decisions they complain of, which is a prerequisite to a finding of denial of justice.308 According to Respondent, \"over the course of the domestic proceedings, they repeatedly abandoned proceedings, failed to take advantage of available remedies or failed to pursue avenues of appeal.\"309 In particular, there were multiple avenues available to attempt to reverse the decisions at issue, but Claimants failed to pursue some of these avenues and, in the others, failed to comply with the applicable procedural requirements.310\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 320; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 62.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 320.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 62.\n\n232.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent contends that Claimants failed to submit evidence to support their argument that it would have been futile to pursue the remedies available to them.311 Claimants' expert Professor Oditah suggested that Claimants could not pursue certain remedies because they did not comply with some procedural requirements, though \"it should have been open to a Court of Appeal to \u2026 to waive the procedural defects.\"312 However, according to Respondent, Professor Oditah did not point to provisions or judicial precedents that would have allowed Nigerian courts to do so.313 Moreover, it stresses that these procedural rules are \"essential to the adequate functioning of any judicial system\", and reflect important due process guarantees.314 Respondent insists that, even if Nigerian courts were particularly formalistic, this would not amount to a denial of justice.315 Finally, Respondent argues that, as affirmed in *Limited Liability Company Amto* : \"[t]he investor that fails to exercise his rights within a legal system, or exercises its rights unwisely, cannot pass his own responsibility for the outcome to the administration of justice, and from there to the host State in international law.\"316\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 63.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 63, citing Continued Hearing Transcript Day 1, 256:8-13.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 64.\n\n*Id.*\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 64, relying on *Franck Charles Arif v.

Section 24 of the NIPC Act\n-------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' interpretation of Section 24 of the NIPC Act. Based on Section 24 of the NIPC Act and on the definition of \"authorized dealer\" in Section 41 of the Act, it is clear that Section 24 of the Act only provides for protection against eventual capital control measures Respondent may impose, by guaranteeing \"unconditional transferability of funds through an authorised dealer.\"317\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 385-389.\n\n234.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants' argument that Respondent was under an obligation to guarantee the payment of \"profits and dividends\" by Pan Ocean is a misconstruction of Section 24 of the NIPC Act, which cannot be used to intervene in payment disputes between two private parties.318\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 389-390.\n\n(3) The Tribunal's Analysis\n---------------------------\n\n235.\n\nClaimants' case is not that Respondent itself seized their investment. Rather, Claimants contend \"that acts or omissions attributable to [Respondent] have led to a state of affairs tantamount to expropriation\" and that this was in breach of the guarantee enshrined in Section 25 (1)(a) of the NIPC Act.319 Respondent denies that there was any conspiracy and that it played any role in the activities of Dr. Fadeyi designed to wrongly deprive Claimants of the benefits of its ownership and to wrest control of Pan Ocean from Claimants. In the absence of complicity by Respondent in the actions of Dr. Fadeyi or anyone else in any plan to deprive the Fabbri family of its investment in Pan Ocean, this Tribunal cannot find Respondent liable for an expropriation in violation of Section 25 of the NIPC Act.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 19.\n\n236.\n\nBelow, the Tribunal explains why the events giving rise to Claimants' claims do not constitute a violation of Section 24 or 25 of the NIPC Act and, accordingly, do not constitute direct or indirect expropriations. The Tribunal considers allegations of violations of customary international law separately, as necessary.\n\n**C.** ***Events Giving Rise to Claim***\n----------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal summarizes the respective positions of the Parties as to the events that led to this claim and, where in dispute, whether these events or activities are attributable to Respondent and whether they amount to a violation of Respondent's obligations. The Tribunal's findings as they relate to the arguments submitted and the claims raised, are presented within the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n(1) The Parties' Positions\n--------------------------\n\na. Claimants' Position\n----------------------\n\n238.\n\nClaimants allege that several acts and omissions attributable to Respondent have caused or have contributed to cause the \"creeping expropriation\" of their investment.320 This conduct is summarized as follows.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 19 et seq.\n\ni. Alleged Arrest and Unlawful Detention of Claimants' Representative\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nIn 1987, Dr. Fabbri gave special powers of attorney to Mr. Rooks to review Pan Ocean's affairs and remove Dr. Fadeyi.321 However, when Mr. Rooks went to Nigeria in 1987, he and his two bodyguards were arrested by Nigerian State Security operatives and detained for at least 103 days or as much as five months.322 Charges were never filed and these individuals were never informed of the reasons of their detention.323 Mr. Rooks never again returned to Nigeria, though he was a Director of Pan Ocean. Dr. Fabbri and his son also refrained to go back, because Dr. Fadeyi convinced them that they would have been arrested too, while Dr. Fadeyi himself never faced the same issues.324\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n\n*Id.* ; Claimants' Reply \u00b6 134(v).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 20.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n240.\n\nThis unlawful detention was \"oppressive, arbitrary and a serious breach of the most basic of human rights\",325 and constituted a violation of Respondent's duty to provide full protection and security to foreign investors and their employees.326 This intervention by Respondent supported Dr. Fadeyi's gradual gain of control over Pan Ocean.327\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 20.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 134(v).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 22.\n\nii. NNPC's Alleged Failure to Assist Claimants or Investigate\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nClaimants allege that their representatives made several attempts, most of which without success, to contact the NNPC and receive guidance in relation to the change in Pan Ocean's beneficial ownership.328 At first, their inquiries were triggered by Dr. Fadeyi's claim that they had to seek the NNPC's approval for the transfer of the beneficial ownership in Pan Ocean to Mrs. Timolini.329 Claimants finally received a short answer from the NNPC (signed by Chief Sena Anthony), affirming that they did not need NNPC's consent, but advising that they seek the consent of the Government and of the other shareholders.330 This is how Claimants discovered the first irregular issuance of shares by Dr. Fadeyi to a third person, Mr. Tomisin.331 Further, in 2004, Mrs. Timolini and her son travelled to Nigeria to meet the Managing Director of the NNPC, but the meeting never took place.332\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 79, 83-84; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 23.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 24.\n\n*Id*., citing Letter from Chief Sena Anthony to Mr. Jacques Jones, 30 March 2000, original Exhibit C-36, renumbered Exhibit C-42.\n\n*Id*., citing Statement of Jacques Jones dated 29/05/2015 \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 25.\n\n242.\n\nGiven the issues Claimants were raising, \"it would have been obvious to the NNPC that there was the real possibility that either it was dealing with the wrong people altogether, or at the very least it was not dealing with everyone it ought to be in relation to the company\", with potentially serious implications for both Claimants and the NNPC;333 and yet, \"Respondent produced no notes, memoranda, minutes, report, or record of enquiry showing that NNPC has discussed, considered, or at least even enquired into this important issue [\u2026].\"334\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 24.\n\n*Id.*\n\n243.\n\nClaimants' expert Professor Omorogbe asserts that the correct approach by the NNPC would have been to initiate an independent investigation.335 The NNPC should have at least searched the company at the CAC. In March 2000, this search would have shown the irregular distribution of shares to Mr. Tomisin and removal of Mr. Rooks as Director, and, in 2005, \"the fraud at the heart of the company, (including the forgery of [Mr.] Rooks's signature).\"336\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 24, citing Expert Report of Professor Yinka Omorogbe \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 31.\n\niii. Respondent's Renewal of the Joint Operating Agreement (\"JOA\")\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nClaimants allege that \"notwithstanding the continuing enquiry and protestations on behalf of the Claimants, in June 2002, the Respondent, (via NNPC), concluded a debt repayment agreement with Dr Fadeyi without the consent of.Timolini or the Claimants, and on 28th May 2003 renewed the JOA with Pan Ocean.\"337 The agreement, concluded without Claimants' knowledge or consent, \"imposed an obligation on the Claimants to pay the sum of US$ 497,694,921 to the Respondent.\"338\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 28.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 1.7.\n\n245.\n\nClaimants point to the witness statement of Mr. John Brunner, who declared that one of NNPC's legal officers told him that he had recommended that the NNPC not sign the JOA because Dr. Fadeyi had not furnished a valid Pan Ocean's board resolution authorizing him to execute the agreement.339 This shows \"internal tensions and precariousness of the NNPC's own position even whilst it was executing acts which directly interfered with and undermined the rights of the true owners of Pan Ocean and 40% in OML98.\"340\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 28.\n\n*Id.*\n\niv. Respondent's Alleged Failure to Scrutinize Pan Ocean Change of Control\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nClaimants submit that the new issuance and allotment of shares in 2005/06 by Dr. Fadeyi required both ministerial and the NNPC's consent.341\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 81; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 31.\n\n247.\n\nFirst, they contend that the requirement of the Minister's consent is imposed by paragraph 14 of the First Schedule of the Petroleum Act, stating that \"[w]ithout the prior written consent of the Minister, the holder of an Oil Prospecting License shall not assign his license or lease or any right power or interest therein or thereunder.\"342 Respondent's expert's contention that the requirement did not apply to the allotment of shares at issue is incorrect.343 The provision includes changes of control in the company that holds the license or lease, and this has always been the common interpretation and practice.344 This is confirmed by the broad wording of paragraph 14, by the policy rationale behind it (i.e. to allow the government to know and approve its joint venture partners), and by paragraph 16 of the First Schedule of the Petroleum Act, which sets out acceptability criteria for the potential assignees and gives the Minister wide discretion in this regard.345 Moreover, the \"Guidelines and Procedure for obtaining Minister's Consent\" confirm that the term \"assignment\" includes \"any transaction that may alter the ownership, equity rights or interest of the assigning company in question.\"346 The requirement of the government's consent was also mentioned in the letter from Chief Sena Anthony of the NNPC.347\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 29, citing First Schedule of the Petroleum Act, \u00b6 14, original Exhibit C-11, renumbered Legal Authority CL-37.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 29.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 29-31.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 30, citing Guidelines and Procedure for obtaining Minister's Consent to assignment of oil and gas assets or interest under the Petroleum Act and the Oil Pipelines Act (2014), \u00b6 3.1, Legal Authority CL-104.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 82.\n\n248.\n\nAs confirmed by a decision of the Federal High Court in the case *Moni Pulo v. Brass Exploration Nigeria Unlimited*, the \"statutory requirement makes any alienation of such right or interest without the Minister's consent void.\"348 According to Claimants, Respondent \"ought to have known that the purported alienation of a portion of the Claimants' 40% participating interest in OML 98 was unlawful and ought not to have been recognised.\"349\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 9.5.4, 12.2, referring to *Moni Pulo v. Brass Exploration Nigeria Unlimited* (2012) 6 CLRN 153, original Exhibit C-159, renumbered Legal Authority CL-68.\n\n*Id.*\n\n249.\n\nSecond, Claimants contend that the NNPC's consent was also required, given the formulation of section 19.1.1. of the JOA between NNPC and Pan Ocean, which mirrors the requirement of ministerial consent and states that: \"no Party may assign or transfer its Participating Interests or any part thereof or any right, power or interest therein or thereunder without the prior written consent and approval of the other Party [\u2026].\"350 According to Claimants, if the NNPC had scrutinized Pan Ocean's situation, it would have denied its consent.351\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 29, citing Joint Operating Agreement between NNPC and Pan Ocean Oil Corporation, 28 May 2003, original Exhibit C-39, renumbered Exhibit C-45.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 31.\n\nv. Federal High Court of Abuja 2005 and 2006 Decisions\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nClaimants contend that wrongful decisions of Respondent's courts allowed Dr. Fadeyi to gain control over Pan Ocean through an irregular issuance of shares and the consequent dilution of the shares of Claimants.352\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 10, 87.\n\n251.\n\nOn 24 November 2005, the Federal High Court of Abuja granted Dr. Fadeyi's request (presented on 21 November 2005) to hold a Board Meeting of Pan Ocean.353 Dr. Fadeyi's affidavit in support of the application stated that he remained the only Director given the unavailability of Mr. Rooks, but failed to mention that the latter had left Nigeria after having been freed from detention (in the circumstances described *supra*).354 Claimants submit that the only parties to the application were Dr. Fadeyi and Pan Ocean, also represented by Dr. Fadeyi.355 The interests of the shareholders were thus not represented, nor did they receive notification of the application (which was, therefore, made *ex parte*).356 The CAC, which months before had issued a report finding irregularities in Pan Ocean's management, was not joined as a party nor notified of the application.357\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 88, 92.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 88, 90, 91.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 89.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n252.\n\nClaimants allege that the Board Meeting was held on 29 November 2005 and Dr. Fadeyi passed resolutions \"allotting the remaining 7,500 unissued shared of Pan Ocean to himself and his associates.\"358 The shareholders were not present at the meeting, and there is no evidence they were notified.359 According to Claimants, this allotment of shares was invalid.360 On 19 January 2006, Dr. Fadeyi passed an ordinary resolution ratifying the share allocation and appointing his associates, Justice Duro Adebiyi and Alhaji Muhammed Dikko Yusuf, as Directors.361 Dr. Fadeyi claimed that he attempted to serve notice of the meeting to Claimants, while in fact he only sent those notices to the Swiss address of Panoco SA, a Swiss subsidiary of Pan Ocean that was liquidated in 1995. He did not attempt to serve them to the registered offices of Claimants or their counsel's address, both known to him from other litigations.362\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 92.\n\n*Id.*\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 93.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 96.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 93-95.\n\n253.\n\nClaimants argue that the decision of 8 February 2006 of the Federal High Court of Abuja, which validated the resolutions passed by Dr. Fadeyi, \"endorsed a fraudulent usurpation of shareholders' authority by the complete misapplication of section 123 of CAMA.\"363 Claimants reject Respondent's expert's contention that the Court could rely on Section 123 to validate improperly issued shares and that the Court did not have a duty to \"dig deep for facts.\"364 According to Claimants' expert, Professor Oditah, Section 123 of the CAMA is only meant to remedy procedural defects, such as failure to give notice to a shareholder, but \"does not enable a court to override substantive provisions such as division of powers between the board and shareholders as reflected in section 124 of the same Act.\"365\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 32.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 98; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 32.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 99-100.\n\n254.\n\nClaimants rely on Professor Oditah's conclusion that \"[i]t is difficult to see how the Judge could have been 'satisfied that in all the circumstances it is just and equitable' to deprive the Claimants of their ownership of Pan Ocean and turn them into a 25% minority on an application of Dr Fadeyi, an employee of Pan Ocean, and to do so without asking for the CAC to be joined as a Respondent and for the Claimants to be put on notice. The court in effect made sections 223 and 123 of CAMA substantive expropriatory provisions rather than purely procedural provisions.\"366 According to Professor Oditah, \"the decision in the 2005 Case is neither procedurally fair, nor a reasonable application of Nigerian law\", and \"falls far short of what can be regarded, under any circumstances, as an acceptable standard of civil justice administration.\"367\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 101, citing Expert Report of Professor Fidelis Oditah \u00b6 19.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 102, citing Expert Report of Professor Fidelis Oditah \u00b6 32.\n\nvi. Failure to Act Upon CAC Findings or Investigate Alleged Criminal Acts Within Pan Ocean\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent is responsible for the acts and omission of the CAC, which is a State organ and statutory agency for regulating and administering companies.368 According to Claimants, the CAC acted in an inconsistent, arbitrary, and non-transparent manner.369 The CAC did not follow-up on its report that contained serious findings about Pan Ocean's management, nor did it impose penalties.370 Moreover, despite its findings, the CAC registered Pan Ocean's new issue of shares to Dr. Fadeyi and his associates.371\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 134(x); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 35.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 134(x).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 35.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 9.4; Claimants' Reply \u00b6 129(vii).\n\n256.\n\nDespite Claimants' repeated grievances and the CAC's serious findings, no criminal investigation into Dr. Fadeyi's conduct was ever initiated.372 Claimants reject Respondent's argument that it was prevented from investigating because there were pending court proceedings on the matter.373\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 37.\n\nvii. Respondent's Alleged Inaction or Facilitation of Dr. Fadeyi's Actions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nFirst, the fact that the numerous letters sent by Claimants to Respondent's instrumentalities remained unanswered and/or went missing, suggests a \"deliberate and systematic cover-up\" that benefitted Dr. Fadeyi.374 In particular, Claimants draw the Tribunal's attention to the letter they received from the NIPC on 26 September 2016375 regarding Pan Ocean's registration status, and which acknowledges the receipt of two letters, three and four years prior.376 Claimants also argue that the cross-examination of Mr. Khalid \"exposed the fact that NNPC's register of correspondence received was not especially reliable [\u2026]\", notably because it did not include a letter Chief Sena Anthony admitted she received.377\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 34.\n\nSee *supra* 148.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 34.\n\n*Id.*\n\n258.\n\nSecond, Claimants allege that Dr. Fadeyi continued to present himself as representative of Claimants in the operating committee of the Pan Ocean/NNPC Joint Venture and, despite their numerous requests, Respondent did not desist from dealing with Dr. Fadeyi.378\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 6.4; Claimants' Reply \u00b6 134(vii).\n\n259.\n\nFinally, Claimants submit that: \"[a]s the Respondent is 60% joint venture partners and host-economy operators, it remains within the Respondents' exclusive preserve to give effect to and restore the Claimants' access to and control of such information that is necessary to enjoy the transfer of the proceeds of their investments. Since 1998 and to date, the Claimants have continuously been denied information about or access to joint venture meetings or joint operating committee deliberations and the accounting, financial, and business affairs or production status of the joint venture operations; all of which constitute prerequisites of any foreign investment decision to be made by the Claimants. No revenue, income, proceeds, or profits whatsoever have been paid to the Claimants for their investments as a result of the Respondent's conduct from September 1998 and on-going to date.\"379\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 9.6.1.\n\n260.\n\nAs mentioned above, Claimants argue that, as Dr. Fadeyi represented Pan Ocean, which is the \"Operator\" of OML 98, he also acted as a representative of the NNPC/POOC joint venture.380 Consequently, some of his conduct would be attributable to Respondent and engage its responsibility.381 In particular, according to Claimants, \"[\u2026] Fadeyi's refusal to respond to the Claimants' demands to restore control of the operator company; to provide joint operation financial information to Claimants was an act attributable to the state.\"382\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 137-139.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 137.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 142.\n\nb. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n261.\n\nRespondent rejects the characterization of the facts put forward by Claimants. As a preliminary remark, Respondent states that: \"The Claimants filed this case on the basis of an alleged collusion or conspiracy between the Respondent and Dr. Fadeyi to deprive the Claimants of control over their investment. Having failed to obtain any evidence to support their false accusation of collusion, the Claimants have presented an entirely new case in their Reply.\"383 Respondent also insists that Claimants' dispute was always with Dr. Fadeyi, a private individual, and that this was confirmed by Claimants' witnesses at the hearing.384 In particular, Respondent notes that the accusations presented at the hearing focused on Dr. Fadeyi gaining control of the company and subsequently obstructing, retaining information and fraudulently issuing shares; the \"2004 Meeting\" concerned Dr. Fadeyi's actions, and not Respondent; and \"the Respondent never instituted an action against the Claimants.\"385\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 241.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 25.\n\n*Id*.\n\n262.\n\nRespondent contends that it \"did not have any responsibility under domestic or international law to intervene in Pan Ocean's internal dispute for control\", even more so because the same dispute was still being litigated before Nigerian courts.386 The main arguments in relation to the conduct allegedly attributable to Respondent can be summarized as follows.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 414.\n\ni. Alleged Arrest and Unlawful Detention of Claimants' Representative\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nClaimants \"failed to present any reliable evidence to support their accusations of unlawful detention.\"387 According to Respondent, they solely rely on a self-serving affidavit of Mr. Rooks, which has limited probative value because Respondent did not have the opportunity to cross-examine him.388\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 353.\n\n*Id.*\n\n264.\n\nClaimants failed to demonstrate any causal link between Mr. Rooks's alleged unlawful detention and Claimants' loss of control over their investment (or their alleged damages).389 Respondent stresses that, according to the affidavit of Mr. Rooks, he worked for the PANOCO Group from 1985 to 1993 and, during the time of his employment, Dr. Fadeyi would regularly meet with Mr. Fabbri in Switzerland to discuss Pan Ocean's business affairs. The correspondence between Dr. Fadeyi and representatives of the Fabbri family submitted by Claimants would confirm that that family was in contact (and on apparent good terms) with Dr. Fadeyi long after 1987, which means that Dr. Fabbri and/or Claimants' representatives \"could have relieved Dr Fadeyi of his functions, either in person or through correspondence, long after Mr Rooks's alleged detention.\"390\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 354.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 354-355, referring to Affidavit of Herbert Rooks, 26 August 2003, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 12 and 13, original Exhibit C-50, renumbered Exhibit C-55; Letters of invitation from Dr. Fadeyi to Mr. Evans and Mr. Brunner, 9 October 1998, original Exhibit C-18, renumbered Exhibit C-24.\n\nii. NNPC's Alleged Failure to Assist Claimants or Investigate\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nRespondent submits that the communications sent to the NNPC on behalf of Mrs. Timolini were only aimed at obtaining an acknowledgment or confirmation of her asserted beneficial ownership of Pan Ocean.391 Chief Sena Anthony replied and confirmed that the NNPC's consent was not required in case of change of Pan Ocean's ultimate beneficial ownership.392 Moreover, according to Respondent, the NNPC was \"under no obligation to acknowledge Ms Timolini's ownership\", as this recognition would have only served private purposes.393 As affirmed in his witness statement by Mr. Khalid, Deputy Manager of the NNPC's Legal Division, \"the NNPC could not and would not interfere in a private dispute over control of Pan Ocean since it has no power to do so under the JOA.\"394\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 39-41.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 41, citing Letter from Chief Stena Anthony (Group General Manager, NNPC) to Mr. Jacques Jones, dated 30 March 2000, original Exhibit C-36, renumbered Exhibit C-42.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 43.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 42, citing Witness Statement of Ahmad Khalid \u00b6 24.\n\n266.\n\nThe fact that the NNPC continued to deal with the acknowledged representative of Pan Ocean's is not evidence of a \"conspiracy.\"395 To the contrary, \"these continuing interactions between the NNPC and existing Pan Ocean representatives were consistent with Nigerian law and the NNPC's general practice.\"396 According to Respondent, this was also confirmed by Claimants' expert, Professor Omorogbe.397\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 44.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 45.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 45-47.\n\n267.\n\nUnder Nigerian company law, shareholders cannot purport to represent a company unless specifically designated to do so. If issues arise in relation to the appointment of representatives, the shareholders can exercise their powers under the company memorandum and articles of association or, if they suspect improprieties, bring the dispute before domestic courts.398 Third parties to a company, such as the NNPC in relation to Pan Ocean, can only validly interact with the appointed representatives.399 Moreover, they are entitled to assume that the memorandum and articles of the company have been complied with, and that the company representatives have been duly appointed and have the authority to perform their duties.400 As a practical matter, it is common practice for the NNPC to engage with the same people representing its joint venture's partners on a regular basis. The NNPC thus continued to deal with Dr. Fadeyi in good faith and in accordance with this practice because, to its knowledge and absent a court decision to the contrary, he was Pan Ocean's legitimate representative.401\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 48, citing the Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap 59 LFN 1990, Section 279(3), as well as Sections 39(4), 41(1) and 299 to 309, Legal Authority RL-20.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 48, citing the Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap 59 LFN 1990, Sections 244(1) and 276(3), Legal Authority RL-20.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 48, 49, citing the Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap 59 LFN 1990, Section 69, Legal Authority RL-20, and Expert Report of Professor Lawrence Atsegbua \u00b6 73.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 50, citing Witness Statement of Ahmad Khalid \u00b6 11; Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap 59 LFN, Legal Authority RL-20.\n\niii. Respondent's Renewal of the Joint Operating Agreement (\"JOA\")\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' contention that it was inappropriate for the NNPC to negotiate with Dr. Fadeyi the agreement for the joint venture's renewal.402 On the contrary, the NNPC concluded the 2002 JOA with Pan Ocean's designated representative.403\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 51.\n\n*Id.*\n\n269.\n\nThe division of roles contained in the 2002 JOA confirms that the NNPC should not be considered as an agent of Respondent.404 The JOA provides that Pan Ocean would represent the joint venture in its relations with the government.405 This would not have been necessary if the NNPC had been acting on behalf of the government.406\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 52.\n\n*Id.*, citing Joint Operating Agreement between Pan Ocean Oil Corporation (Nigeria) and the NNPC, dated 28 May 2002, Article 9.1, p. 48, original Exhibit C-39, renumbered Exhibit C-45.\n\n*Id.*\n\n270.\n\nFinally, Respondent rejects Claimants' argument that the clause of the JOA regarding repayment of Pan Ocean's debt would be evidence of either NNPC's \"self-dealing\" or its collusion with Dr. Fadeyi. As even Claimants have acknowledged in these proceedings,407 the sum at issue reflected Pan Ocean's outstanding debt arising out of the dispute over the 1984 Crude Oil Sales Contract and represents the initial principal amount and the interest agreed upon in the 1989 Settlement Agreement.408\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 55, 56, referring to Letter from Messrs.

Respondent's Alleged Failure to Scrutinize Pan Ocean Change of Control\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nContrary to Claimants' contentions, neither the Ministry of Petroleum Resources nor the NNPC had the statutory mandate to intervene in the matter of the allotment of Pan Ocean's shares made in November 2005, or more generally in the private dispute around Pan Ocean.409\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 88, 89, 95.\n\n272.\n\nWith regard to the alleged role of the Ministry, Claimants' arguments should fail because: (i) the Minister had no regulatory basis for intervening in a private dispute that was being litigated before Nigerian courts; (ii) the Ministry's consent was not required; and (iii) in any event, the Ministry had no reason to cease its interactions with Pan Ocean's management.410\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 96 et seq.\n\n273.\n\nFirst, relying on the expert reports of Justice Ayoola, the Petroleum Act only attributes to the Ministry general supervisory powers over the operations carried out under oil mining licenses, and does not give the Ministry any power or authority to intervene in a private dispute regarding control of a company.411 A Minister's intervention would have been inappropriate because the dispute over shareholding in Pan Ocean was litigated before Nigerian courts, and the Ministry ought to respect the constitutional principle of independence of the judiciary.412\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 97, citing First Expert Report of Justice Emmanuel Ayoola \u00b6 14.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 98, citing First Expert Report of Justice Emmanuel Ayoola \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\n274.\n\nSecond, Claimants failed to establish that the Minister's consent was required to give effect to the 29 November 2005 allotment of shares.413 As of 2005, \"it was unsettled in Nigerian law whether an allotment of shares in a company holding rights in an oil mining lease was to be regarded as an 'assignment' of a participating interest in the underlying oil mining lease, requiring the consent of the Minister for Petroleum Resources under paragraph 14 of the First Schedule to the Petroleum Act 1979.\"414 Moreover, at that time, there were no judicial precedents confirming that an allotment of shares could be regarded as an \"assignment.\"415 The case on which Claimants' expert Professor Omorogbe relied (*Moni Pulo v. Brass*) does not solve the issue because (i) the case was only decided in 2012 and is currently under appeal and (ii) it concerned a transfer of shares. It did not address the key issue of what amounts to an \"assignment.\"416 The 2012-2014 Department of Petroleum Resources amendments to the legislative framework, such that they expressly include \"allotments\", confirms the absence of a clear rule prior to those amendments.417\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 99.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 100.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 101.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 102, referring to the Second Expert Report of Professor Yinka Omorogbe, 30 March 2016, Annex 1.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 103.\n\n275.\n\nThere is no evidence that the Minister was aware of the allotment or that Claimants raised the issue following the 2005 Board Meeting Case, which also means that the Minister was in no position to grant or refuse its consent.418\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 104.\n\n276.\n\nFinally, \"[t]he Minister would have had no basis for unilaterally ceasing to regard the long-time Managing Director as the legitimate representative of Pan Ocean.\"419 As acknowledged by Claimants' expert Professor Omorogbe, Dr. Fadeyi is his capacity as Managing Director has been \"the face of Pan Ocean for several decades.\"420\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 106.\n\n*Id.*, quoting Second Expert Report of Professor Yinka Omorogbe p. 16.\n\n277.\n\nWith regard to the alleged role of the NNPC, Respondent submits that Claimants' experts failed to identify \"a credible statutory or contractual basis on which the NNPC could or should have intervened.\"421 Respondent argues that the NNPC can only exercise powers that are expressly conferred on it by the NNPC Act and nothing in this Act suggests that the NNPC could interfere in an internal dispute over shareholding of a private company.422 In particular, contrary to Claimants' suggestion, \"Section 5(1)(h) of the NNPC Act in no way allows the NNPC validly to interfere in the internal management of a Joint Venture Partner.\"423 Moreover, Respondent submits that such a duty to intervene could not be based on the 2002 JOA either: under the 2002 JOA, the NNPC is a mere contracting party in the joint venture, which would not be required to conduct enquiries into (or interfere with) the other party's internal disputes over shareholding.424 Respondent argues that it would have been even less appropriate for the NNPC to intervene since the matter was pending before Nigerian courts.425\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 108.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 109-110.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 111.\n\n278.\n\nThe Tribunal should reject Claimants' argument that the allotment of shares amounted to a transfer of their interest in OML 98 and OPL 275, and would have thus required the NNPC's consent in accordance with Article 19.1.1 of the 2002 JOA.426 Respondent's expert Professor Atsegbua argues that this provision did not apply in the present case: since Pan Ocean (corporate entity with separate legal personality) held the same participating interest in the joint venture and remained the operator of OML 98, an allotment of shares in the upstream companies, even if it led to a change of control in Pan Ocean, did not amount to a transfer of the participating interest requiring NNPC's consent.427 Moreover, even if Article 19.1.1 of the 2002 JOA applied to the transfer of shares, \"it would have been up to Pan Ocean to seek the consent of the NNPC under the clause.\"428 However, Respondent alleges that nothing on the record suggests that either Pan Ocean or Claimants attempted to raise the issue of consent with the NNPC in relation to the 2005 allotment of shares.429\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 112-113.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 114-115, citing Second Expert Report of Professor Lawrence Atsegbua \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 116.\n\n*Id.*\n\n279.\n\nFinally, absent a court decision to the contrary, the NNPC was entitled to assume that Dr. Fadeyi was the legitimate representative of Pan Ocean.430 Moreover, \"the NNPC would not have been in a position to take account of any alleged notices of a change in the ownership and management of Pan Ocean.\"431\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 118.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 119.\n\nv. Federal High Court of Abuja 2005 and 2006 Decisions\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nContrary to Claimants' submissions, the decisions rendered by the Federal High Court of Abuja in November 2005 and February 2006 were a reasonable and procedurally fair application of Nigerian law.432\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 46.\n\n281.\n\nWith regard to the 2005 decision, Respondent submits that, first, Dr. Fadeyi's application was based on Sections 223(1) and 223(2) of the CAMA. These provisions have a pragmatic purpose: they can be used to validate a general meeting or a meeting of the board of the company that would normally be invalid under Section 221(1) of the CAMA because it was not notified to those entitled to receive notification. \"As the sole active and Managing Director of Pan Ocean, Dr Fadeyi was eligible to make the application to the court to derogate from the quorum requirement.\"433\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 47-49.\n\n282.\n\nThe broad formulation used in Section 223 of the CAMA suggests that courts should be provided some discretion when they establish whether it was indeed \"impracticable\" to call or conduct a meeting following the ordinary procedures.434\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 55.\n\n283.\n\nIt was not unreasonable for the Federal High Court of Abuja to find that the requirements under Section 223 of the CAMA were met, based on, *inter alia*, the affidavit provided by Dr. Fadeyi with the application.435 Dr. Fadeyi alleged that it had become impracticable to manage the affairs of Pan Ocean, because the company's quorum required two directors. He alleged that he was unable to locate Mr. Rooks and that, after the death of Dr. Fabbri, he needed to be able to appoint new directors to make sure that the company was not paralyzed. He stated that Pan Ocean was a \"going concern with several duties, obligations and liabilities\", and filed an \"Affidavit of Urgency\", claiming that it was also impossible to comply with the statutory required filing of documentation.436\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 64.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 50-57, citing *inter alia* Second Expert Report of Justice Emmanuel Ayoola, 20 July 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 103-109.\n\n284.\n\nFinally, Claimants' criticism of the Court's decision should be rejected. In particular, (i) the Court had no reason to doubt that Dr. Fadeyi was unable to locate Mr. Rooks who, as of November 2005, was deceased;437 (ii) the Court had no reason to require the presence of Claimants at the hearing, because Dr. Fadeyi was not seeking an order against them, nor were they entitled to receive notice of the Board of Directors meetings;438 (iii) the fact that the court addressed the application as a matter of urgency is not surprising, given the uncontested nature of the application and the evidence before the court;439 and (iv) the decision merely authorized the holding of a meeting without getting involved in the content.440\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 62.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 63.\n\n285.\n\nThe 2006 decision validated the allotment of shares decided by the Board of Directors of Pan Ocean on 29 November 2005. Dr. Fadeyi requested that the Court validate the allotment of unissued shares on the basis of Section 123 of the CAMA. This provision gives some discretion to courts to decide whether validation would be \"just and equitable\" in the circumstances.441 Contrary to Claimants' suggestion that the decision was incompatible with the division of roles enshrined in Section 124 of the CAMA, Section 123 of the CAMA expressly grants the authority to validate decisions that would have been otherwise regarded as invalid.442\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.\n\n286.\n\nSecond, Claimants allege that Dr. Fadeyi served the notices to the wrong addresses on purpose. Even if this were the case, Respondent could not be held responsible for Dr. Fadeyi's actions, and the court was entitled to rely on Dr. Fadeyi's statement that the notices were returned. Moreover, the address of the notice was the same address of Claimants as listed in the annual returns of Pan Ocean, attached to the CAC Report of April 2005.443\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 76, 77, citing Report of the Corporate Affairs Commission on the Investigation into the Affairs of Pan Ocean Oil Corporation (Nigeria) Unlimited, dated April 2005, attachment K, original Exhibit C-45, renumbered Exhibit C-51.\n\n287.\n\nThird, the evidence before the Court suggested that Claimants could not be contacted. Thus, it would have been contrary to the purpose of Section 123 of the CAMA to require their presence at the hearing, since the provision allows courts to validate directors' decisions precisely under such circumstances.444 Moreover, Claimants do not explain in what capacity the CAC could have taken part in proceedings concerning the allotment of shares of a private company.445\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 78.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 79.\n\n288.\n\nFinally, the evidence before the Court suggested that the issuance of shares was necessary, because of Pan Ocean's financial needs. The decision relied on the affidavit of a Mr. Wole Aladedoye, who submitted that Pan Ocean had substantial debt. The allotment of shares was motivated by the need to raise capital to continue its operations. Respondent also notes that the quantum expert reports submitted by both Parties confirm that in 2006, Pan Ocean was undergoing financial difficulties.446\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.\n\n289.\n\nRespondent concludes that \"the court's finding was reasonable, based on the evidence before it.\" Moreover, it argues, Claimants did not point to any \"red flag\" that could have led the Court to depart from the ordinary principles for evaluation of evidence. Respondent further submits that, if Claimants were convinced that the evidence before the Court was factually incorrect or misleading, they could have filed an appeal, but \"they failed to do so within the time allowed and effectively mismanaged their right to seek redress of the court's decision.\"447\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 84-88.\n\nvi. Failure to Act Upon CAC Findings or Investigate Alleged Criminal Acts Within Pan Ocean\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' contention the CAC acted in an \"inconsistent and arbitrary manner.\"448 First, Respondent agrees that the \"CAC Report\" of April 2005 was in favor of Claimants: it confirmed that Claimants were the only two shareholders of Pan Ocean, and that Dr. Fadeyi had committed two irregularities in 1998, when he attempted to issue shares to a Mr. Tomisin and to appoint other two directors without the quorum.449 However, Respondent also stresses that the CAC is a statutory body established by the CAMA, which has the authority to investigate the affairs of companies and to report on the results of its investigations, but is \"not empowered to order companies to undertake certain actions following from its report.\"450\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 91.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 79-82.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.\n\n291.\n\nSecond, when the CAC later registered the allotment of shares made on 29 November 2005, it was merely following the order of the Federal High Court of Abuja of 8 February 2006, which validated the allotment.451 According to Respondent, Claimants' expert Professor Oditah confirmed that the CAC did not have the authority to override the decision of the Court and, in any event, there were no sufficient reasons for it to conclude that the allotment was irregular or that the decision of the Court was unsound.452\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 92.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 92-93, citing Second Expert Report of Professor Fidelis Oditah \u00b6 7.\n\n292.\n\nClaimants' vilification of Respondent's law enforcement agencies is unwarranted. According to Respondent, \"the fact that the Respondent's Police or the [Economic and Financial Crimes Commission] did not act as the Claimants would have wished does not mean that there was no investigation or that they did not fulfil their duties.\"453 Moreover, Claimants themselves had initiated judicial proceedings on the same issues. Contrary to Claimants' argument that the principle of *sub-judice* does not apply to crimes, \"it would have been impossible for law enforcement to secure a conviction of Dr Fadeyi when the main act being denounced as a crime had been validated by a court order and was subject to appeal or set-aside proceedings in other civil suits.\"454\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 42.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n\nvii. Respondent's Alleged Inaction or Facilitation of Dr. Fadeyi's Actions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nRespondent categorically rejects Claimants' argument that Respondent, through its entities \"should have intervened, either *sua sponte* or prompted by the Claimants, to protect them from the actions of private parties that, according to the Claimants, sought to sever them from their interest in and control over Pan Ocean.\"455 According to Respondent, the NNPC, the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, and the CAC did not have \"a statutory mandate to intervene in a private shareholding dispute, even if relating to a partner in a Joint Venture. Nor could they second-guess the outcome of proceedings before the Nigerian courts.\"456\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 89.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 90.\n\n(2) The Tribunal's Analysis\n---------------------------\n\ni. Alleged Arrest and Unlawful Detention of Claimants' Representative\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nAlthough this has been presented in an inconsistent manner, the Tribunal accepts that, in 1987, Respondent detained Mr. Rooks. This Tribunal, however, has been unable to find any relationship between this detention and Claimants' claim for expropriation.\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that even if the purpose of Mr. Rooks's 1987 trip to Nigeria had been to terminate Dr. Fadeyi, Claimants have not shown that there was any connection between Dr. Fadeyi and his potential concerns about his termination and Respondent's detention of Mr. Rooks. Claimants have stated that this detention was \"in connection with a disagreement over termination of a crude oil lifting contract and to enforce its [Respondent's] rights as a joint venture partner.\"457 Claimants have not proven Dr. Fadeyi's knowledge of Mr. Rooks's intention to terminate Dr. Fadeyi's employment. Nor have they demonstrated that if such knowledge existed, it caused Dr. Fadeyi to engineer the arrest and detention of Mr. Rooks, which could have been entirely independent of Dr. Fadeyi's concerns, if such concerns existed.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 4.3.\n\n296.\n\nNor do further actions alleged by Claimants, as related to Dr. Fadeyi, show a concerted effort by Respondent to destroy Claimants' investment in Nigeria. No evidence demonstrates attribution to Respondent of any actions that might have been taken by Dr. Fadeyi to reduce Dr. Fabbri's salary, or to authorize cash calls Dr. Fadeyi made on NNPC on behalf of Pan Ocean.\n\nii. NNPC's Alleged Failure to Provide Guidance and Investigate Claims\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nClaimants argue that the (in)actions of the NNPC are imputable to Respondent, as Respondent's national oil company. They claim that the NNPC's failure to investigate their claims to be shareholders in 2000 and 2005 is further evidence of a creeping expropriation. Respondent's and its agencies' failures to intervene in the events involving Pan Ocean, however, do not lead directly to culpability on the part of Respondent. In principle, State-controlled entities are considered as separate from the State, unless they exercise elements of governmental authority within the meaning of ILC Article 5.458 The NNPC's operation and its role and powers as described in the Nigerian legislation confirm that the NNPC is a commercial entity that only engages in \"private or commercial\" activities.459 The alleged violations of Claimants' rights by the NNPC would, therefore, not be attributable to Respondent.460\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 338-339.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 340-344.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 344.\n\n298.\n\nWhile it was perhaps rude for Respondent or NNPC to fail to respond to correspondence from Claimants in 2000, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the NNPC would have had a duty to investigate the validity and circumstances of any changes to the shareholdings of Pan Ocean. There is no statutory, contractual or regulatory basis on which consent is required from the NNPC or the Minister for the allotment of shares in a private company, like Pan Ocean.\n\n299.\n\nThe NNPC's regulatory mandate is set out in the NNPC Act.461 The NNPC cannot directly or indirectly exercise any power not expressly conferred upon it by the Act, and nothing in its mandate allows it to interfere in the internal shareholding disputes of a private company.462 Further, should a duty have existed, Claimants have not met their burden of proving that what the NNPC did was orchestrated for or on behalf of Respondent with the ultimate intent of depriving Claimants of their investment in Nigeria. Even if Respondent had had the authority to intervene, in 2005 Claimants' shareholding was a matter pending before Nigerian Courts and the NNPC does not have the power to doubt the decisions of the Nigerian courts.\n\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation Act, Cap N123 LFN, Legal Authority RL-21.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Justice Emmanuel Ayoola \u00b6 71.\n\n300.\n\nIn this context, it must be recalled that Mrs. Timolini's standing in Pan Ocean could have been questioned and was finally abandoned in 2010 when, for reasons that have not been disclosed to the Tribunal, Mrs. Timolini yielded her interest in Impex to Dr. Fabbri's estate.463\n\nDeed of Surrender by Mrs. Anabella Timolini, Original Exhibit C-16, renumbered Exhibit C-22; Respondent's Appendix A.\n\n301.\n\nAgainst this context, it is understandable that the NNPC would have hesitated to communicate with the alleged representatives of Claimants. While Respondent has not offered an adequate explanation for the failure to answer and deal with correspondence or to meet and speak with these individuals, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the NNPC's inaction was orchestrated for or on behalf of Respondent, or with the ultimate goal of depriving Claimants of their investment in Nigeria.\n\n302.\n\nClaimants also allege that Respondent's failure to respond to their correspondence is further indication of the creeping expropriation. The issue for the Tribunal is whether Respondent's failure to address Claimants' correspondence, whether through incompetence or malevolence, was intended to deprive Claimants of their investment in Nigeria. The effect of not responding to the correspondence allowed the situation to further develop, resulting in this arbitration. There is, however, no indication that Dr. Fadeyi interfered with any of the correspondence received or sent by the Ministry or the NNPC or that there was a concerted effort to remove Claimants as shareholders. Even if Respondent was aware that there was a dispute between Claimants and Dr. Fadeyi, as indicated above, neither NNPC or Respondent had a duty to intervene.\n\niii. Respondent's Renewal of the Joint Operating Agreement (\"JOA\")\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nWhile Claimants characterize the extension of the JOA as self-dealing and a breach of Respondent's and NNPC's responsibilities to ensure that NNPC was participating with the proper partner, the context is key. In 2002, the JOA was due for renewal and was expressly anticipated and welcomed in the debt repayment plan penned by Dr. Fabbri on 17 June 1998, prior to his death.464 Pursuant to that letter, repayment would begin in 2002 and would last seven years.465 Extending the JOA was important. It was a valuable asset for NNPC and Respondent, and for Pan Ocean. It was only natural that the JOA would be negotiated through Pan Ocean's representative at the time, Dr. Fadeyi. The Tribunal cannot see a link between the extension of the JOA and the debt repayment agreement on the one hand, and NNPC allegedly working towards or engineering that Claimants would lose the beneficial ownership and control of Pan Ocean, on the other.\n\nLetter from Dr. Vittorio Fabbri to the NNPC Managing Director, 17 June 1998, Exhibit R-28 (\"We look forward to executing a Joint Operating Agreement with NNPC which shall incorporate the fore-going terms and conditions\"), making no mention of a change in ownership.\n\n*Id.*\n\n304.\n\nThe JOA did not give the NNPC authority to intervene in the internal disputes of Pan Ocean's shareholders.466 The JOA set out the NNPC's mandate and role within the Joint Venture,467 which is contractual in nature. No evidence demonstrates that such a regulatory agency has a right to intervene in internal disputes among shareholders.468\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 109, citing Second Expert Report of Professor Lawrence Atsegbua \u00b6\u00b6 50-55; See also First Expert Report of Professor Lawrence Atsegbua \u00b6\u00b6 16 and 72.\n\nJoint Operating Agreement between Pan Ocean Oil Corporation and the NNPC, dated 28 May 2002, Exhibits R-11(1) and R-11(1)PLUS.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 109, citing Second Expert Report of Professor Lawrence Atsegbua \u00b6\u00b6 50-55; see also First Expert Report of Professor Lawrence Atsegbua \u00b6\u00b6 16 and 72.\n\n305.\n\nFinally, no evidence demonstrates that the NNPC had a duty to verify Dr. Fadeyi's authority to enter into the JOA. Given the inconsistencies involved with respect to Mrs. Timolini's position and participation in the company, it may have been reasonable to believe that he was fully authorized to engage in an anticipated renewal transaction. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds no breach with respect to the renewal of the JOA.\n\niv. Respondent's Failure to Scrutinize the Change of Control\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nHere, the Tribunal is again tasked to examine whether, in the context of change in control of Pan Ocean, NNPC's inaction can be attributed to Respondent or whether this inaction was wrongful under Nigerian law. The Tribunal recalls its decision, above, regarding the attributability of the NNPC's actions to Respondent.\n\n307.\n\nThe regulatory mandate of the NNPC derives from the enabling statute, the NNPC Act.469 The NNPC cannot directly or indirectly exercise any power not expressly conferred on it by that Act. Nothing in the NNPC's regulatory mandate allows the NNPC to interfere in internal shareholding disputes of a private company.470 NNPC's general power to regulate companies does not \"translate into a general power to intervene in the private disputes of Joint Venture partners.\"471 As indicated above, this was not changed through the JOA, which sets out the NNPC's contractual mandate and role within the Joint Venture.472 As noted elsewhere in this Award, no evidence demonstrates that the NNPC as regulatory agency has received power to intervene in an internal dispute among Pan Ocean's shareholders.473\n\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation Act Cap N123 LFN 2004, Legal Authority RL-21.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Justice Emmanuel Ayoola \u00b6 71.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 108.\n\nJoint Operating Agreement between Pan Ocean Oil Corporation and the NNPC, 28 May 2002, Exhibits R-11(1) and R-11(1)PLUS.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 109, citing Second Expert Report of Professor Lawrence Atsegbua \u00b6\u00b6 50-55; see also First Expert Report of Professor Lawrence Atsegbua \u00b6\u00b6 16 and 72.\n\n308.\n\nEven if NNPC had had authority to intervene, it simply could not have done so because the dispute was a pending matter before the Nigerian courts. The NNPC does not have the power to doubt the decisions of the Nigerian Courts,474 nor would it have been appropriate for any Minister to intervene while the matter was pending. Of course, this is independent of the fact that, even if Dr. Fadeyi was able to manipulate or direct the NNPC to ignore or overlook his abuses or fraudulent actions, that would not be attributable to Respondent. If the NNPC misused its authority and power, the remedy would be through the Nigerian Courts \u2013 at least at first instance. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds no treaty breach in any alleged failure of Respondent to scrutinize change of control in Pan Ocean.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 110.\n\n309.\n\nClaimants argue that the deprivation of their rights also constitutes, *a fortiori*, a violation of Section 24 of the NIPC Act, which provides for the unconditional transferability of funds, including dividends or profits attributable to the investment.475 According to Claimants, the expropriation of their investment \"has led directly to the inability to receive any dividends, profits or other proceeds from their asset.\"476 The Tribunal agrees with Respondent's position that Section 24 of the NIPC Act cannot be used to enable or require Respondent intervene into payment disputes between two private parties.477 Thus, Claimants have not suffered a violation of Section 24 of the NIPC Act.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 17, citing Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission Act, Cap 117 LFN 1995, Section 24, Legal Authority CL-1.\n\n*Id.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 389-390.\n\nv. Decisions of the Federal High Court of Abuja in 2005 and 2006\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nWhile Respondent's actions and the actions of their courts are attributable to Respondent, Claimants have again not met their burden of proving that Respondent had any involvement in Dr. Fadeyi's actions. Dr. Fadeyi's failure to notify Claimants is, therefore, not attributable to Respondent. The court did not breach its obligations in relying on Dr. Fadeyi's statement that the notices were returned, as the address of the notice was the same address of Claimants as listed in the annual returns of Pan Ocean, attached to the CAC Report of April 2005.478\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 76-77, citing Report of the Corporate Affairs Commission on the Investigation into the Affairs of Pan Ocean Oil Corporation (Nigeria) Unlimited, dated April 2005, attachment K, original Exhibit C-45, renumbered Exhibit C-51.\n\n311.\n\nThe circumstances leading to the 2005 and 2006 decisions are largely undisputed, leaving it for the Tribunal to determine whether these cases were (part of) a judicial expropriation of Claimants' asset or, alternatively, whether the cases were legally incorrect and a miscarriage of justice.\n\n312.\n\nWhile the 2005 Board Meeting Case appears to have been legally wrong and unjust, it was not a judicial expropriation. The Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent was responsible for the 2005 Board Meeting Case Decision, or for the Courts' actions that enabled Dr. Fadeyi to take over Pan Ocean and deprive Claimants of their ownership thereof. Rather, that case appears to have been a miscarriage of justice. Claimants' remedy would have been to challenge it in courts, before the Nigerian Court of Appeal. Rather than do so and exhaust their domestic remedies, however, Claimants abandoned proceedings.\n\n313.\n\nThe following actions resulted in the 2005 Board Meeting Case. On 21 November 2005, Dr. Fadeyi applied to the Federal Court of Abuja for leave to hold a Board Meeting of Pan Ocean, attaching an affidavit in support of his application which, among other things, stated that Mr. Rooks \"departed Nigeria and had since never returned to the country\" and \"his efforts to locate him had proven abortive.\"479 Three days later, the Federal Court of Abuja granted Dr. Fadeyi's application. Shortly thereafter the Board Meeting took place during which resolutions were passed allotting the remaining 7,500 unissued shares of Pan Ocean to Dr. Fadeyi and his associates.480 Claimants submit that no shareholders were present at that meeting and that \"there is no evidence that they were even notified of it.\"481\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 88 (i) and (vi).\n\nReturn of Allotment of Shares and Notice of Ordinary Resolution of the Company, Exhibit R-47.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 92.\n\n314.\n\nIn order to validate the allotment of those shares, Dr. Fadeyi had to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting of Pan Ocean shareholders; at that same meeting he would also seek to appoint Justice Duro Adebiyi and Alhaji Muhammed Dikko Yusuf as Directors of the company.482 On 19 January 2006, again in the absence of the shareholders of Pan Ocean, an ordinary resolution was passed through which Dr. Fadeyi appointed his associates Justice Duro Adebiyi and Alhaji Muhammed Dikko Yusuf as Directors and the share allocation was effected.483 Claimants allege that the 8 February 2006 decision of the Federal High Court of Abuja, which validated the resolutions passed by Dr. Fadeyi, qualifies as an expropriation under Section 25 of the NIPC Act or a denial of justice.484\n\nReturn of Allotment of Shares and Notice of Ordinary Resolution of the Company, Exhibit R-47.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 96.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 111, 114.\n\n315.\n\nAs indicated in the previous section, the JOA did not give the NNPC the authority to intervene in the internal disputes of Pan Ocean's shareholders. In this case, Claimants' remedy would have been to challenge the decision in the courts. Initially, this is what happened. It is, however, unclear why the case was withdrawn and did not go on appeal. In principle, this case and its merits could have been presented before the Nigerian Court of Appeal. Even if Dr. Fadeyi and NNPC raised procedural issues such that the case could never proceed, as alleged, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent was responsible for any action that was taken in the courts as part of an alleged intention to enable Dr. Fadeyi to take over Pan Ocean and deprive Claimants of their ownership of Pan Ocean.\n\nvi. Failure to Act on CAC Findings or Investigate Alleged Crimes\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nThis issue concerns whether the alleged actions or omissions of the CAC, which Claimants submit is a State organ and statutory agency regulating and administering companies, are treaty breaches that are attributable to Respondent.485\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 134(x); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 35.\n\n317.\n\nThe CAC investigation occurred while the proceedings in the 2004 Fraud Case were pending before the Federal High Court of Lagos, when Claimants asked the CAC to conduct a separate investigation of Pan Ocean, in parallel with that Court proceeding.486\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 78.\n\n318.\n\nThe CAC found, in April 2005, that (i) the only two shareholders of Pan Ocean were Claimants, (ii) Mrs. Timolini owned beneficial stocks in Claimants and the ownership of Pan Ocean was, therefore, vested in her, (iii) the affairs of Pan Ocean were conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the shareholders, and (iv) that the shareholders had been excluded from running the affairs of Pan Ocean since 1 September 1998. The CAC Report blamed irregularities on Dr. Fadeyi's having acted without sufficient quorum.\n\n319.\n\nThe Court in concluding the 2004 Fraud Case on 10 November 2005, however, found the CAC Report to be inadmissible hearsay information, and did not allow it to be submitted as evidence. As a result, and given the findings of the 2004 Fraud Case, no government institution could have relied on that report.\n\n320.\n\nCAC looked at the bigger picture and expressed serious concerns about Pan Ocean. The fact that it was disregarded by a court for procedural irregularity does not mean that the various findings of the CAC report had no merit. As these issues were in the air, one would have expected at least some investigation or enquiry into Pan Ocean, its shareholders, and management. Respondent's failure to investigate the Pan Ocean situation further may have been due to incompetence or irresponsibility, or as suggested by Claimants, greater intrigue. Either way, there was a failure on the part of Respondent to act prudently when looking at the relationship of Pan Ocean with NNPC and the Ministry of Petroleum.\n\n321.\n\nAs indicated above, the NNPC would not have had a duty or authority to intervene. Even if Respondent and its agencies failed to intervene when they could have, this alone does not directly lead to culpability on the part of Respondent. Granted, if Respondent had nonetheless conducted a further investigation into the matter, it may have determined that Dr. Fadeyi did not have proper authority for his actions on behalf of Pan Ocean and/or that he was exceeding his authority. Respondent argues that it did not have the authority to \"secure a conviction of Dr Fadeyi when the main act being denounced as a crime had been validated by a court order and was subject to appeal or set-aside proceedings in other civil suits.\"487\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 43.\n\n322.\n\nThe question here is whether Respondent appreciated, or should have appreciated, that the likely effect of the management of Pan Ocean by Dr. Fadeyi and Respondent's non-intervention into the case, would be to deprive Claimants of their investment in Nigeria. Respondent's inaction could be indicative of wrongdoing, but the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent could have anticipated that the combined effect of Dr. Fadeyi's management of Pan Ocean and Respondent's non-intervention would deprive Claimants of their investment. The Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent was the complicit or driving force in Dr. Fadeyi's plan. Given the facts as they were at the time, Claimants have not established that Respondent was privy to or had reason to question the purpose and intent of Dr. Fadeyi's plans. The Tribunal, therefore, finds no breach of Respondent's obligations.\n\nvii. Respondent's inaction, lack of cooperation, and facilitation of Dr. Fadeyi's actions\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nConsistent with the decisions above, the Tribunal does not find that Dr. Fadeyi, while acting as a representative of the NNPC/POOC joint venture was also engaging in conduct attributable to Respondent and thus, engaging its responsibility.488 Claimants' contention that Dr. Fadeyi's \"refusal to respond to the Claimants' demands to restore control of the operator company; to provide joint operation financial information to Claimants was an act attributable to the state\" is rejected.489\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 137.\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 142.\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the allegations related to (i) the failure of Respondent to investigate criminal acts within Pan Ocean and (ii) the fallacy of Respondent's excuses for action, together.\n\n325.\n\nClaimants contend that there was no basis for Respondent's failure to investigate the criminal acts within Pan Ocean uncovered in the CAC report, \"The inescapable conclusion point to collusion and cover-up.\"490 Claimants reject Respondent's \"afterthought\" explanation that it could not intervene because issues were *sub judice*.491 Respondent's further explanations also do not justify or support its inaction because the complaints began well before any court action, investigation of Claimants' grievances were not prevented by court action, and there was no contemporaneous correspondence giving such explanations.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 37.\n\n326.\n\nRespondent denies Claimants' assertions that its law enforcement agencies did not do anything. Respondent explains that the Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission simply do not have the power to \"secure a conviction of Dr. Fadeyi when the main act being denounced as a crime had been validated by a court order and was subject to appeal or set-aside proceedings in other civil suits.\"492\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 43.\n\n327.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent asserts that Mrs. Timolini's standing in Pan Ocean had been called into question by the decision in the 2004 Fraud Case. All of the petitions that Claimants accuse Respondent's law enforcement of neglecting to investigate were signed solely, jointly or on behalf of Mrs. Timolini.493\n\nSee e.g*.* Exhibits C-78, C-81 and C-82.\n\n328.\n\nWith respect to the NNPC and the Minister of Petroleum's alleged failure to act as argued by Claimants, as explained above, Respondent submits that the NNPC does not have the authority to intervene in shareholding disputes of its JV partners. In support of its assertion, Respondent refers to Mr. Jones's words at the hearing where he admitted that he had not seen any precedent for such intervention in other instances.494 This was also confirmed by Professor Omorogbe.495\n\nHearing Transcript Day 2, 55:8-9 and 93:8-9.\n\nContinued Hearing Transcript Day 1, 289:6-9.\n\n329.\n\nLastly, Respondent argues the fact that Claimants have litigated the dispute and activated *sub-judice* principles has prevented the NNPC and the Minister from acting as Claimants wished. Professor Omorogbe recognized that court actions could bar executive intervention and that out-of-court intervention \"depends on the facts.\"496\n\nContinued Hearing Transcript Day 1, 301:19-22.\n\n330.\n\nWith regard to the judicial system of Nigeria and the national courts' actions, Respondent argues that (i) there is no evidence of a pattern of scandalous decisions against Claimants, (ii) the very first decision (2002 Ownership case) was decided in favour of Claimants, (iii) Claimants did not lose at every turn and not all decisions against them have been condemned by their experts.497 In fact, Respondent argues that Claimants themselves \"prevented their cases from going ahead, including by discontinuing one, withdrawing an appeal, serially amending filings and making an incompetent application.\"498\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 49.\n\n331.\n\nThis behavior of Respondent may give rise to suspicions that there was something more than incompetence or bad practice. Following the CAC Report, Respondent might have launched an investigation to determine whether Dr. Fadeyi had proper authority for his actions on behalf of Pan Ocean, or was exceeding his role at Pan Ocean. Respondent might have investigated whether concerns expressed by Claimants and the Fabbri family had any merit.\n\n332.\n\nRespondent took no action and did not get involved. Nonetheless, the fact that Respondent and its agencies failed to intervene when they could and perhaps should have to determine the merits of complaints received and suspicions of what was happening at Pan Ocean, itself does not lead directly to culpability on the part of Respondent.\n\n**D.** ***Legal Foundations for Claims under Customary International Law***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Statutory Provisions\n------------------------\n\n333.\n\nAbove, the Tribunal found that the following broadly drafted language of Section 26 of the NIPC Act includes claims under customary international law, incorporated into Nigerian Law through Article 32 of the Interpretation Act (1964).499\n\n\"26. Dispute settlement procedures\n\n(1) Where a dispute arises between an investor an any Government of the Federation in respect of an enterprise, all efforts shall be made through mutual discussion to reach an amicable settlement.\n\n(2) Any dispute between an investor and any Government of the Federation in respect of an enterprise to which this Act applies which is not amicably settled through mutual discussions, may be submitted at the option of the aggrieved party to arbitration as follows\u2014\n\n(a) In the case of a Nigerian investor, in accordance with the rules of procedure for arbitration as specified in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act; or\n\n(b) In the case of a foreign investor, within the framework of any bilateral or multilateral agreement on investment protection to which the Federal Government and the country of which the investor is a national are parties; or\n\n(c) In accordance with any other national or international machinery for the settlement of investment disputes agreed on by the parties.\n\n(3) Where in respect of a dispute, there is disagreement between the investor and the Federal Government as to the method of dispute settlement to be adopted, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes Rules shall apply.\"\n\nInterpretation Act 1964, Legal Authority CL-92.\n\n334.\n\nArticle 32 of the Interpretation Act states as follows in relevant part:\n\n\"32. Law in force with respect to Federal matters\n\nSubject to the provisions of this section and except in so far as other provision is made by any Federal law, the common law of England and the doctrines of equity, together with the statutes of general application that were in force in England on the 1st day of January, 1900, shall, in so far as they relate to any matter within the legislative competence of the Federal legislature, be in force in Nigeria.\"\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(2) The Parties' Positions\n--------------------------\n\na. Claimants' Position\n----------------------\n\n335.\n\nClaimants contend that the alleged acts and omissions summarized above also constitute violations of Respondent's duties and obligations under customary international law, including \"a responsibility to ensure that (i) the treatment of a foreign investor does not fall below recognized international minimum standards, and/or (ii) that the foreign investor receives fair and equitable treatment, and/or (iii) is not subject to arbitrary, unreasonable and/or unfair treatment which has the effect of failing to protect his economic rights, interests and/or security.\"500\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 9.2.\n\n336.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention allows the Tribunal to apply \"such rules of international law as may be applicable\", which includes customary international law.501 Moreover, Claimants argue that the rules of customary international law are integrated into Nigerian law because they are part of the common law of England and Wales, which was received into the Nigerian legal system according to Section 32(1) of the Interpretation Act of 1964.502 Claimants reject Respondent's expert Justice Ayoola's suggestion that only the Supreme Court of Nigeria can establish whether customary international law applies, because that would mean that parties should wait until the case goes to the Supreme Court to have a decision on this point.503\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 6.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*, citing Second Expert Report of Justice Emmanuel Ayoola \u00b6\u00b6 150-156.\n\ni. Minimum Standard\n-------------------\n\n337.\n\nFirst, Claimants state that under customary international law, Respondent has the duty to respect a minimum standard of treatment, as established in *Neer v. Mexico*.504 For this standard to be violated, \"[\u2026] an act must be sufficiently egregious and shocking \u2013 gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons*.*\"505 Claimants argue that \"if a reasonable observer was apprised of the totality of the acts or omissions of the Respondent in its treatment of the Claimants, over this period of time, he would readily conclude that it was 'blatantly unfair', 'manifestly arbitrary', 'evidently discriminatory' and 'shocking.'\"506 In particular, Claimants allege that the decision of the Federal High Court in the 2005 case was a \"gross miscarriage of justice\" and constituted a clear violation of the minimum standard of treatment of foreign investors.507\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 6, citing *L.F.H.

Fair and Equitable Treatment and Full Protection and Security\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nSecond, Claimants argue that the Fair and Equitable Treatment is a standalone standard in international customary law.508 According to Claimants, this is confirmed by the \"plethora of BITs which contain FET clauses\", which evidence the \"level of acceptance amongst States\" as to FET's status as customary principle.509\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 143.\n\n*Id.*\n\n339.\n\nAccording to Claimants, \"the Respondent has violated the basic standards of transparency, good faith, fairness, procedural proprietary and due process which ought to have been accorded a foreign investor.\"510 In particular, Claimants mention Respondent's failure to address the several investor-related grievances presented by Claimants, to deal with them fairly and to provide information in a transparent way, as well as its failure to protect (and refusal to give effect to) Claimants' enjoyment of their rights and the benefits deriving from their investment.511\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6 146.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 11; Claimants' Reply \u00b6 134.\n\n340.\n\nIn the alternative, Claimants argue that, even if the Tribunal accepts Respondent's argument that only the minimum standard is a principle of customary international law, the alleged actions and omissions by Respondent's instrumentalities also constitute a violation of the standard as formulated in *Waste Management*, which refers to a state behavior that is \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.\"512\n\nClaimants' Reply \u00b6\u00b6 144-145; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 18.\n\n341.\n\nFinally, Claimants argue that Respondent has not accorded Claimants full protection and security in Nigeria, stating that \"[i]nstead, its Directors and representatives have been unlawfully detained and refused access to government instrumentalities or entry into Nigeria.\"513\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 11(v).\n\nb. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n342.\n\nWithout prejudice to its objections to jurisdiction (summarized *supra*), Respondent contends that Claimants failed to meet their burden of proof as to the existence of the alleged rules of customary international law and their binding effect, which would require evidence of both a consistent State practice and of the *opinio iuris*.514 As a consequence, it concludes that \"[i]n the absence of any proven rule of customary international law beyond this, the Respondent's obligations under international law are limited to the customary international law minimum standard of protection.\"515\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 393-397.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 398.\n\n343.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"Claimants have failed both to: (i) rebut the Respondent's arguments regarding the applicable legal standard; and (ii) discharge their burden of proving that any of the Respondent's actions constitutes a violation of the international minimum standard.\"516\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 67.\n\ni. International Minimum Standard\n---------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nRespondent states that international tribunals' interpretation of the minimum standard has not departed significantly from the high threshold established in *Neer v. Mexico* (which was very close to concepts of denial of justice, due process and physical protection), and that the customary minimum standard of treatment of investors \"continues to be limited to the 'gross denial of justice', 'manifest arbitrariness' or a 'complete lack of due process', and similarly 'egregious and shocking' treatment.\"517 Moreover, claims in relation to arbitrary and unreasonable measures are also subsumed under this customary standard, and are thus limited to \"a wilful disregard of due process of law\" or \"an act which shocks [\u2026] a sense of juridical propriety.\"518\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 399-407, citing *inter alia* *L.F.H.

Indeed, Claimants did not even allege that Respondent's acts and omissions would constitute a violation of domestic law.522 Moreover, to the extent that Claimants allege that Respondent is responsible for arbitrary and unreasonable measures, they also failed to meet the required standard of \"manifest arbitrariness.\"523\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 410.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 411-413.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 414.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 415-418.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 428-430.\n\n346.\n\nRespondent stresses that, by not interfering in a private dispute, the various state entities allegedly involved acted within their constitutional roles and limitations.524 Moreover, according to Respondent, international tribunals cannot act as courts of appeal: the mere fact that national decisions contain mistakes of fact or of law (or *a fortiori*, that a party is not satisfied about the outcome) will not attract international liability unless the claimant shows a gross \"denial of justice\" or \"manifest arbitrariness.\"525 Respondent highlights that its expert, former Supreme Court Justice Ayoola, confirmed that the decisions in question were taken after fair hearings, where parties where duly heard, there were no allegations of bias, and the court considered all the issues and addressed all the submissions.526 According to Respondent, Claimants had an opportunity to be heard and present evidence before national courts, which normally excludes a violations of the minimum standard.527 Moreover, Respondent contends that Claimants failed to exhaust the available local remedies, which is required to prove denial of justice claims, since they discontinued a suit and failed to appeal the other, while another appeal is still pending.528\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 419.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 420-422.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 423.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 424-425.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 425-427.\n\nii. Fair and Equitable Treatment and Full Protection and Security\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nRespondent contends that the \"fair and equitable treatment standard is not a standalone protection under customary international law.\"529 Respondent's arguments can be summarized as follows: (i) Claimants failed to point to decisions, commentaries or legal authorities supporting their position;530 (ii) the mere fact that the fair and equitable treatment is a common provision in carefully negotiated BITs and other investment treaties (which are \"compromises between investment protection and sovereign control over foreign investment\") does not amount to the required State practice and *opinio iuris*, and is therefore not sufficient to establish the existence of a rule of customary international law;531 (iii) \"where tribunals have adopted a more expansive interpretation of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, they have done so explicitly on the basis that they are interpreting an autonomous treaty standard, as opposed to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law\", and thus the decisions interpreting these treaty provisions are of no assistance in the present case;532 (iv) \"to the extent that some tribunals have suggested that there is no difference between the interpretation of fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the VCLT and the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, such tribunals have done so without reference to evidence of State practice or *opinio juris* ;\"533 and (v) arbitral decisions may assist in summarizing the content of customary international law, if they do so expressly, but do not constitute state practice themselves, and cannot create or prove customary international law.534\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 432.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 431.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 432, citing M.

Sornarajah, *The International Law on Foreign Investment* (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 205, Legal Authority RL-109.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6 461.\n\n(3) The Tribunal's Analysis\n---------------------------\n\n353.\n\nAbove, the Tribunal found that Claimants' claims under international law are properly before this Tribunal. Having found above that Claimants have not suffered an expropriation, the Tribunal now amplifies its views on the alleged violation of key legal standards, including (i) the minimum standard of treatment, and (ii) the fair and equitable treatment standard (including the full protection and security standard). The Tribunal declines to evaluate whether the actions alleged could constitute a denial of justice \u2013 a term used by each Party in its pleadings. Initially, Claimants argued extensively on whether Respondent's alleged actions constituted a \"denial of justice\" in the sense of a judicial expropriation and in the sense of a violation of customary international law. In their post-hearing submission, however, Claimants expressly indicated that they are not advancing their case under that theory, but rather on the theory of indirect expropriation.546 The Tribunal, therefore, refers to its conclusions regarding acts allegedly constituting an indirect expropriation, above, and ends its discussion of \"denial of justice.\"\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 33, 45.\n\n354.\n\nClaimants invite the Tribunal to assess this case pursuant to the minimum standard of treatment established in the *Neer v. Mexico* case. Under those criteria, action violates international law when it is \"[\u2026] sufficiently egregious and shocking \u2013 gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons*.*\"547\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 6-7..\n\n355.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to accept Claimants' position regarding the international minimum standard and its applicability, however, the Tribunal has concluded that Dr. Fadeyi's actions are not attributable to Respondent.548 Moreover, the Tribunal has concluded that neither the NNPC nor Respondent have breached their duties toward Claimants with respect to the alleged failures to investigate. The Tribunal has also found that the decisions of the Federal High Court of Abuja from 2005 and 2006 do not create liability for Respondent. Thus, accepting this standard and in light of the above, the Tribunal would need only consider whether the detention of Mr. Rooks violated the minimum standard of treatment or the fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security standards.\n\n*Supra* section B.\n\n356.\n\nHere, Claimants have not presented arguments or evidence to support their claim that the detention of Mr. Rooks was a violation, separate from their allegation that this 1987 arrest set into motion a chain of events that led to Claimants ultimately losing control of their company. Above, Claimants did not establish the relevance of the detention of Mr. Rooks, which pre-date the enactment of the NIPC Act, to their expropriation claim. Contrary to their submission that their \"Directors and representatives have been unlawfully detained and refused access to government instrumentalities or entry into Nigeria\",549 Claimants have not established the unlawfulness of the detention of Mr. Rooks. Likewise, Claimants have not shown that this \"set into motion a chain of events\", as they have not shown that they were denied entry into Nigeria or that they were refused access to government instrumentalities. Instead, the record demonstrates that in 2004, Mrs. Timolini and her son travelled to Nigeria to meet the Managing Director of the NNPC. No reason is given for why, between 1998 and 2004, there was no travel to Nigeria.550 As Claimants have not established the key elements for a claim under the international minimum standard, the Tribunal cannot find a violation of the minimum standard of treatment.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 11(v).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 25.\n\n357.\n\nThe Tribunal, likewise, cannot find a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, including a duty to provide full protection and security. Claimants have not shown that there was any connection between Respondent's detention of Mr. Rooks (which Claimants have also stated was \"in connection with a disagreement over termination of a crude oil lifting contract and to enforce its rights as a joint venture partner\"551) and Dr. Fadeyi or his potential concerns of termination. Claimants have likewise not met their burden of establishing the elements of a fair and equitable treatment or full protection and security claim.\n\nClaimants' Memorial \u00b6 4.3.\n\n**E.** ***Damages***\n--------------------\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot find that Respondent has any responsibility for losses suffered by Claimants as alleged in these proceedings.\n\n359.\n\nHaving found no liability on the part of Respondent, the Tribunal need not proceed to discuss damages other than in relation to costs, as set forth below.\n\n**VI. Costs**\n-------------\n\n**A.** ***The Parties' Positions***\n-----------------------------------\n\n(1) Claimants' Position\n-----------------------\n\n360.\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants request that the Tribunal order Respondent to pay the costs associated with the present proceedings, including professional fees and disbursements, \"on a full indemnity basis.\"552 According to Claimants, the Tribunal is empowered by ICSID Rule 28(1)(b), and the principle that succumbing parties pay should apply in international arbitration. Claimants contend that their request is in line with the principle of full compensation.553\n\nClaimants' Annex to the Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 56.\n\nClaimants' Annex to the Post-Hearing Brief p. 15.\n\n361.\n\nIn their Observations on allocation of costs, Claimants invoke four principles established by ICSID tribunals that ought to guide the present Tribunal: (i) tribunals have broad discretion to allocate costs; (ii) the \"costs follow the event\" principle is almost universally accepted and may be viewed as a general principle of international law; (iii) the conduct of the parties during the proceeding may be taken into consideration in the costs allocation; and (iv) the costs must be considered reasonable.554\n\nClaimants' Observations on allocation of costs, \u00b6\u00b6. 9-14\n\n362.\n\nClaimants also submit that the Respondent's conduct caused the proceeding to be lengthy, which further justifies an order by the Tribunal that Respondent should bear the Claimants' reasonable costs.555\n\nClaimants' Observations on allocation of costs, \u00b6\u00b6. 15-18.\n\n363.\n\nClaimants further contend that their costs \u2013 i.e. legal fees, arbitration costs, and expenses\u2013 are reasonable and justified.556\n\nClaimants' Observations on allocation of costs, \u00b6\u00b6. 19-24.\n\n364.\n\nLastly, Claimants explain that Respondent is not entitled to recover its costs since the representation of the Republic of Nigeria was offered \"at no cost to Respondent\" by its counsel.557\n\nClaimants' Observations on allocation of costs, \u00b6\u00b6. 25-27.\n\n365.\n\nIn their Statement of Costs, Claimants submitted the following costs:\n\nArbitration costs, expenses and disbursements:\n\nClaim for Indemnity for Costs in relation to ICSID Arbitration\n\n![](http://img.jusmundi.com/image/decision/c5266f810f0e2a799900fbf794bd11acd39e3b0a.png)\n\nLegal Fees of ALP\n\n![](http://img.jusmundi.com/image/decision/4e9ad17e2c73752d1abeb249edcbdc632581ec7d.png)\n\nLegal Fees of Oba Nsugbe QC\n\n![](http://img.jusmundi.com/image/decision/aef13375c69d3d56139bbf578e76e343b52b2ffc.png)\n\nLegal Fees of Adebimpe Nkontchou\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Counsel** | **Number of Hours** | **USD Rate** | **Amount** |\n| **BN** | **680.5** | **750** | **USD 510,375.00** |\n\n(2) Respondent\u2019s position\n-------------------------\n\n366.\n\nRespondent submits in its Post-Hearing Brief that the Tribunal should reject Claimants\u2019 claims and order that they bear the entirety of the costs incurred in the present arbitration.558\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 9.\n\n367.\n\nIn its Observations on Costs Allocation, Respondent submits that, should it prevail, it is entitled to receive reimbursement of its expenses and costs on a full indemnity basis.559\n\nRespondent's Observations on Costs Allocation, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.\n\n368.\n\nRespondent explains that tribunals consider a number of factors when exercising their discretion to allocate costs, such as the relative success of the parties, the quality of the claims, the complexity of the issues, the reasonableness of the parties' expenses, and the parties' conduct during the proceeding. Respondent adds that \"[a] *ll of these factors support an award to the Respondent of all of its costs in this arbitration because the Federal Republic of Nigeria has been forced to go through the arbitral proceedings in order to achieve success, and should not be penalized by having to pay for the process itself*.\"560\n\nRespondent's Observations on Costs Allocation, \u00b6 6.\n\n369.\n\nRespondent further contends that not only should Claimants' claims fail, whether for want of jurisdiction or on the merits, but they should never have been brought before ICSID and have been registered by the Centre on the basis of Claimants' misrepresentation with respect to the registration of their investment under the NIPC Act.561\n\nRespondent's Observations on Costs Allocation, \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.\n\n370.\n\nRespondent also submits that Claimants' misconduct throughout the proceeding warrant an allocation of costs in favour of Respondent, including because such conduct increased the costs of the arbitration.562\n\nRespondent's Observations on Costs Allocation, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n\n371.\n\nRespondent then explains that it is entitled to recover all of its costs notwithstanding the fact that it has been represented by the law firm Afe Babalola & Co at no cost throughout the proceeding.563\n\nRespondent's Observations on Costs Allocation, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14.\n\n372.\n\nRespondent submits that its costs, comprised of arbitration costs, legal costs, witness costs, travelling and accommodation expenses, and disbursements, are entirely reasonable, and that, in the event the Tribunal finds for Claimants, then costs are not reasonable and Respondent should not be ordered to reimburse them.564\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations on Costs Allocation. \u00b6\u00b6 11-35. The Tribunal notes that the numbering of paragraphs in the Respondent's Observations on Costs Allocation restarts at 11 after paragraph 14, on page 7.\n\n373.\n\nIn its Statement of Costs, Respondent submitted the following costs:\n\n**A.

Such decision shall form part of the award.\"\n\n375.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney's fees and other costs, such as arbitration costs, expenses and disbursements, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n376.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the Parties' respective submissions, filed by both sides first on 8 June 2020 and then again by both sides on 30 June 2020. The Tribunal will first address legal costs, and then all other costs.\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that Respondent has prevailed, and that a \"costs follow the event\" principle might normally lead to recuperation of legal fees.\n\n378.\n\nUnder the circumstances of this case, however, no legal costs have been incurred by Respondent. Thus no legal costs can be awarded to Respondent.\n\n379.\n\nRespondent was represented *pro bono* by Aare Afe Babalola & Co, which confirmed having served in this matter without compensation.

In this connection, the Tribunal notes communications received by Mr. Garel at ICSID, sent by the Nigerian Attorney-General on 27 October 2016 and by the Afe Babalola & Co firm on 29 October 2016.\n\n381.\n\nThe Attorney General on 27 October 2016 confirmed that \"*Afe Babalola & Co offered their services to the Respondent in relation to this present proceedings at no cost for the Respondent. [\u2026] As earlier stated in my letter of 4 August 2016, in proffering a robust defence to the Respondent, Are Afe Babalola of Afe Babalola & Co has also engaged the firm of Volterra Fietta and Ms. Rameau at no cost to the Respondent*.\"\n\n382.\n\nTwo days later, Afe Babalola & Co. stated as follows: \"*As confirmed in the letter of the Attorney General of 27th October, 2016 my firm's representation of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in these proceedings is at absolutely no cost to the government.*\"\n\n383.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal cannot but acknowledge that the Republic of Nigeria, Respondent in these proceedings, has not incurred any legal costs, and, consequently, cannot order the reimbursement to the Respondent of legal costs that it has not incurred.\n\n384.\n\nWith respect to all other costs, the Tribunal considers, in principle, that the \"costs follow the event\" approach applies and that, consequently, Claimants would have to reimburse to Respondent all other costs it incurred in defending Claimants' claims. However, the amounts claimed by the Respondent under the Witness Costs, Travelling and Accommodations Expenses, and Disbursements categories have given rise to much doubt among the Tribunal members about their genuineness and accuracy, as explained below. The Tribunal finds itself therefore unable to order the reimbursement of these costs by Claimants to Respondent.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the amount claimed under the Travelling and Accommodations Expenses category, i.e. USD 1,270,000.00, to be unreasonably high. The Tribunal understands that a Nigerian delegation had to travel to and stay in London on four different occasions, and that the resulting costs would necessarily be higher than that of Claimants, but the amount claimed is over 10 times higher than Claimants' and seems to reflect opulent, if not sumptuous choices made by Respondent. The Tribunal considers that it would be unfair to order Claimants to bear the financial consequences of the travelling and accommodation choices made by Respondent when such choices have driven the costs to over a million dollars.\n\n386.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the amounts claimed under the Witness Costs category to be odd. Not only are the costs claimed for Engr. Bello and Prof. Atsegbua identical, i.e. USD 50,986.59 each, which seems highly unlikely, but they each are exactly half of the costs claimed with respect to Justice Ayoola, i.e. USD 101,973.18. It is as if the Respondent has divided by two the costs of Justice Ayoola to establish and claim the costs of Engr. Bello and Prof. Atsegbua. In addition, the fact that the costs claimed with respect to Daniel Harris is a round figure of USD 400,000 seems artificial and therefore unlikely to reflect reality. The Tribunal is unable to order the reimbursement of these costs when the amounts claimed are so obviously odd.\n\n387.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds the amounts claimed under the Disbursements category to be odd. First, they all are round figures, which seems artificial and therefore unlikely to reflect reality. Second, the amount claimed as \"Hyperlink of processes and documents\", i.e. USD 30,000 seems greatly exaggerated, especially when it does not appear than any of the Respondent's submissions or even lists of supporting documents were hyperlinked at all. The Tribunal is unable to order the reimbursement of these costs when the amounts claimed are so obviously odd.\n\n388.\n\nThe Tribunal will apply the \"costs follows the event\" principle to the arbitration costs. The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses  \nProfessor William W. Park USD 369,949.75  \nProfessor Julian D.M. Lew USD 122,379.18  \nJustice Edward Torgbor USD 443,062.37  \nICSID's administrative fees USD 254,000.00  \nDirect expenses USD 130,868.44  \n**Total** **USD 1,320,259.74**\n\n389.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.566 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 660,129.87. Claimants shall therefore reimburse USD 660,129.87 to Respondent with respect to costs of the arbitration.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to each side in proportion to payments advanced to ICSID.\n\n**VII. Award**\n--------------\n\n390.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) Jurisdiction\n----------------\n\n391.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms its 29 October 2014 Decision on Preliminary Objections, deciding at paragraph 147 that Objection No. 1 related to Consent would be rejected insofar as it calls into question whether Section 26 of the NIPC Act constitutes a standing offer to arbitrate. The Tribunal found that Section 26 did indeed constitute such a standing offer.\n\n392.\n\nThe Tribunal also confirms its Decision to reject Objections No. 2 (Role of the ICSID Rules), No. 4 (Proper Party) and No. 5 (Time Bars).\n\n393.\n\nWith respect to the other jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal in this Award rejects the Objection related to the adequacy of the Claimants' acceptance of that offer to arbitrate and the existence of a dispute.\n\n394.\n\nThe Tribunal also rejects Objections No. 3 (Registration) and No. 6 (Premature Filing).\n\n(2) Liability\n-------------\n\n395.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no liability on the part of Respondent in connection with Claimants' loss of control over their investment, Pan Ocean.\n\n396.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Respondent has not breached its obligations toward Claimants under Nigerian law or under international law.\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal hereby dismisses Claimants' claims for damages and for restitution.\n\n398.\n\nThe Tribunal hereby dismisses Claimants' claim to be reinstated as the beneficial owner of the 40% participating interest in OML 98.\n\n399.\n\nThe Tribunal hereby orders Claimants to pay USD 660,129.87 to Respondent as reimbursement of its share of the arbitration costs incurred in these proceedings.\n\n400.\n\nAll other claims are dismissed."}]}
