INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nI dissent from the decisions of my esteemed colleagues (henceforth, the Majority) (i) to hold EU law to be a part of the applicable law under Article 26(6) of the ECT and (ii) to dismiss the bulk of the Claimant\u2019s claims grounded on Article 10(1) of the ECT. I concur, on substantially different grounds, in the Majority\u2019s decisions that (iii) the claw-back feature of the Disputed Measures breached the first two sentences of Article 10(1) of the ECT and (iv) EU law on state aid does not bar the claim based on the claw-back feature.1 The purpose of this dissenting opinion is to explain (a) to what extent and why I disagree with the Majority\u2019s decisions and their supporting reasons on points (i) and (ii) and (b) to what extent and why I concur in the Majority\u2019s decisions on points (iii) and (iv) but disagree on the reasoning on which they are based.\n\nI also dissent, consequentially, from the Majority\u2019s decisions on the quantum of compensation. If my views on the merits had been accepted, the compensation to which the Claimant is entitled should have been calculated under different principles. For the purposes of this Partial Dissent, it is not necessary to develop this point further.\n\n2.\n\nI regard a dissenting opinion as an opportunity to voice criticism on important points of law or fact on which no agreement has been reached. If we are to make progress in our search for better solutions to legal issues that are serious and recurring, we should be ready to criticize the decisions of others and the grounds on which those decisions are based, as well as to open our minds to countercriticism. That is why it is not enough, in my view, for a dissenting arbitrator merely to state an alternative position, as it is often done. The dissenter should explain, respectfully, what he or she sees as flaws in the majority\u2019s position, so that others may assess the relative strength of the opposing reasons. This is the approach to be followed in this Partial Dissent.\n\n3.\n\nI should make it clear that I hold my colleagues in the highest regard, personally and professionally. My criticism of their views is always directed *ad sententias et argumenta*, never *ad homines.*\n\n4.\n\nAs will become apparent, while I agree in some respects with the Majority\u2019s analysis and conclusions on the matters subject to this dissent, I disagree in many (perhaps most) other respects. Because the points of agreement are intertwined with those of disagreement, a comprehensive discussion is necessary. And because I find the Majority\u2019s analysis flawed in critical respects, I prefer to discuss most contested issues in my own words.\n\n**II. ON THE APPLICABLE LAW**\n-----------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe main issue presented under the rubric of \"Applicable Law\" is whether the law to be applied by the Tribunal in this case should include EU law. The Majority acknowledges that Japan is not a party to the EU treaties and \"is not bound by them as such.\"2 Yet, the Majority takes the view that the Tribunal is allowed \"to note the settled legal consequences of facts established in the course of the proceedings, for example, the fact that unnotified state aid gives rise to adverse consequences under Article 108(3) of the TFEU.\"3 On this basis, the Majority concludes: \"To that extent, at least, EU law is part of the applicable law under Article 26(6) of the ECT.\"4 True to that conclusion, when it comes to discussing EU state aid, the Majority applies EU law *as law*.5\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability (henceforth, Decision), \u00b6 232. Unless stated otherwise, the abbreviations used in this Partial Dissent are the same as those used in the Decision.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 236.\n\n*Id.* I note that the phrase \"at least\" leaves open the possibility of a broader application of EU law.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 423(b), 428-32, especially 427, 432. The way in which the Majority applies EU law is discussed in detail *infra*, \u00b6\u00b6 121-139.\n\n6.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s conclusion that EU law is part of the applicable law is unsupported by the ECT and contradicts the basic principle of international law that treaties are not binding on non-parties. As explained below, except to the extent that the ECT itself may contain a *renvoi* to EU law, the Tribunal may take cognizance of EU law only *as a fact*, and only to the extent necessary to apply the ECT and other rules and principles that are applicable as law.\n\n7.\n\nThe starting point of the analysis must be Article 26(6) of the ECT, which prescribes the law to be applied in an arbitration under Part V:\n\n\"A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\"6\n\n**CL-0001** , Energy Charter Treaty (henceforth, ECT), Art. 26(6).\n\n8.\n\nThis provision directs the Tribunal to apply, in addition to the ECT itself, \"*applicable* rules and principles of international law.\"7 The EU treaties are (or rather contain) rules and principles of international law, but they are not \"applicable\" in this case, because Japan is not a party to them and, as the Majority acknowledges, is not bound thereby.8 Therefore, EU law cannot be part of the substantive law applicable in this case.\n\n*Id.* (emphasis added).\n\n**RL-0010**, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (henceforth, VCLT), Art. 26 (\"*Pacta sunt servanda*. Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.\")\n\n9.\n\nThe Majority also refers to Article 16 of the ECT, which provides that if two or more Contracting Parties to the ECT have entered or may enter into a treaty concerning the subject matter of Part III or Part V of the ECT, neither the other treaty nor the ECT shall be construed to derogate from a provision of each other that is more favourable to the Investor or the Investment.9 In this case, Article 16 is plainly inapplicable, because Spain and Japan have not entered into any other treaty concerning the subject matter of Part III or Part V of the ECT. Nevertheless, the Majority takes the view that \"Article 16 remains indirectly relevant as concerns the relation between the ECT and the TFEU, in that by clear implication the ECT prevails over the TFEU to the extent that the ECT provision \u2018is more favourable to the Investor or Investment\u2019.\"10 The Majority offers no basis for this alleged implication, other than saying that \"[o]ne would not expect a non-EU member state, or the nationals of such a state, to be treated less well.\"11 The interpreter\u2019s expectations, however, are not a substitute for what Article 16, properly interpreted under the rules of the VCLT, actually provides. In fact, the ECT does prevail over the TFEU in this case, but not because one would expect the rule of Article 16 to be extended to Japan or its nationals, but because the TFEU is inapplicable, and hence there is no conflict for Article 16 to resolve.\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 16 (\"Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of Part III or V of this Treaty, (1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that agreement; and (2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty, \u2014 [applying to both (1) and (2)] where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.\")\n\nDecision, \u00b6 229.\n\n*Id.*\n\n10.\n\nThe Majority correctly dismisses the Respondent\u2019s argument that, under the authority of the CJEU\u2019s pronouncements in *Achmea*, the Tribunal has no competence to apply EU law.12 The Majority does so by construing *Achmea* narrowly, as not applying to a multilateral treaty such as the ECT, to which the EU itself is a party.13 Such a narrow construction is a possible one, although there are more fundamental reasons to conclude that the *Achmea* decision does not control the Tribunal\u2019s competence, a competence which does not derive from the EU treaties but from the ECT.14 In the present case, however, the question of the Tribunal\u2019s competence to apply EU law *as law* is academic, because, for the reasons stated, EU law is not part of the applicable law.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 233-234.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 235-236.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, *Vattenfall AB and others v. Federal Republic of Germany*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12, Decision on the *Achmea* Issue, 31 August 2018.\n\n11.\n\nAll that being said, the Majority is right to point out that \"the EU treaties have established legal regimes for regulating matters such as state aid, which are furthermore directly applicable as part of the law of the member states,\" with the consequence that \"[t]o the extent that Japanese or other third-state corporations establish activities in the EU that are regulated by those regimes, they may be affected by them.\"15 Those legal regimes and the consequences derived therefrom are among the *factual* circumstances that the Tribunal must take into consideration in applying the provisions of the ECT. To give those facts proper consideration in the proper context, it is neither necessary nor justifiable to turn them into applicable law. In this respect, EU law is in a position akin to that of Spanish law, in which it happens to have been incorporated: Spanish laws and judicial and administrative decisions are to be considered as facts, except to the extent that the ECT might require, expressly or by clear implication, that they be applied as law.16\n\nDecision, \u00b6 232.\n\n*Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v. Poland)*, 1926 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 7, \u00b6 52 (\"municipal laws are merely facts which express the will and constitute the activities of States, in the same manner as do legal decisions or administrative measures.\") For example, the ECT implicitly requires the application of Spanish law *as law* to determine whether the Claimant had rights subject to expropriation under the rules of Article 13 of the ECT.\n\n**III. ON THE MERITS**\n----------------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s claims are based on (i) Article 13(1) of the ECT, which concerns the expropriation of investments, and (ii) three clauses of Article 10(1) of the ECT, which concerns the promotion, protection, and treatment of investments. The Tribunal unanimously dismisses the claim based on Article 13(1) on grounds with which I am generally in agreement. As for the claims based on Article 10(1) of the ECT, the Tribunal (by majority) dismisses them, except for the claim related to the claw-back feature of the Disputed Measures, which the Tribunal upholds under the principle of stability derived from the first and second sentences of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n13.\n\nI concur in the portion of the Majority\u2019s decision which upholds the claim related to the claw-back feature of the Disputed Measures, although the reasons for my concurrence are different from those of the Majority. I dissent from the Majority\u2019s dismissal of the remainder of those claims and from the reasoning supporting the dismissal. I explain in this section the extent of my partial concurrence, the extent of my dissent, and the reasons therefor.\n\n14.\n\nThe starting point of the discussion must be Article 10(1) of the ECT. The entire text of that provision, with added numbers for each sentence and italics to set out the clauses on which the Claimant relies, is as follows:\n\n\"[1] *Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area*. [2] *Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment*. [3] Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and *no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal*. [4] In no case shall such investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations. [5] Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.\"17\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 10(1) (emphasis added).\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s first claim under Article 10(1) of the ECT is purportedly grounded on the first and second sentences taken together. The Majority likewise discusses those two sentences together, on the ground that the first sentence cannot be interpreted in isolation from the second. To simplify the presentation, I shall also address the two sentences in the same subsection, although I shall analyse them individually (Subsection B).\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s second claim under Article 10(1) of the ECT, based on the italicised portion of the third sentence, will be discussed in Subsection C.\n\n17.\n\nThe Majority ends its analysis by addressing the Respondent\u2019s defences based on EU rules on state aid. One defence is dismissed altogether and the other is dismissed in respect of the sole claim which the Majority upholds, which is based on the claw-back feature of the Disputed Measures. I concur in the dismissal of those defences, but to a different extent and on different grounds (Subsection D).\n\n**B. CLAIMS GROUNDED ON ARTICLE 10(1), FIRST AND SECOND SENTENCES,OF THE ECT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The First Sentence**\n-------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe first sentence of Article 10(1) states: \"*Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area.*\"18 This provision, as well as all other provisions of the ECT at issue in this case, must be interpreted under the rules of interpretation of the VCLT. First and foremost, the provision must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the treaty.19\n\n*Id.* (emphasis added).\n\n**RL-0010**, VCLT, Arts. 31 and 32, especially Art. 31.1.\n\n19.\n\nThe Majority states, citing some earlier decisions in support, that the first sentence of Article 10(1) cannot be interpreted in isolation from the second sentence.20 It would be more accurate to say that the first and the second sentences form the proximate context of each other, and context is one of the primary elements of interpretation under the rules of the VCLT. Aside from the role of proximate context in the interpretation of both sentences, there is no reason why the two sentences cannot be applied separately, each in accordance with its own prescriptive content.21\n\nDecision, \u00b6 314.\n\nBy \"prescriptive content\" of a treaty provision I mean the conduct that the provision qualifies as permitted, not permitted, or obligatory, including the set of conditions under which such qualification takes effect. I do *not* understand the Majority\u2019s position to be that (i) the first sentence is merely hortatory or otherwise lacks prescriptive force, or (ii) the prescriptive content of the first sentence is subsumed within that of the second sentence, so that the first sentence does not really impose any separate obligation. These theories, which several tribunals have espoused, have no basis in the ECT. The first sentence is couched in the same prescriptive language (\"shall\") as the second. A tribunal faced with multiple treaty provisions framed in equally mandatory language does not have discretion to select which ones it will treat as prescriptive and which ones it will not.\n\n20.\n\nAs for the content of those obligations, the Majority states that the first sentence \"does not give a general mandate to ECT tribunals to decide whether government decisions affecting investments are \u2018equitable\u2019 or \u2018favourable.\u2019\"22 That statement is correct, but as a comment on the content of the first sentence it misses the mark. The first sentence does not purport to give ECT tribunals any such \"general mandate\" nor does the scope of the sentence refer to (any and all) \"government decisions affecting investments.\" In fact, the scope of the obligations arising from the first sentence and the effects of that sentence on the Claimant\u2019s claims are more limited than the concerns that prompted the Majority\u2019s statement.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 314.\n\n21.\n\nThe first sentence requires the state to encourage and create \"stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions\" *for the making of investments*. Leaving aside for the moment what counts as stable, equitable, favourable, and transparent (a matter to be discussed later), those conditions concern only \"the making of Investments.\" Article 1(8) of the ECT defines \"Make Investments or Making of Investments\" as \"establishing new Investments, acquiring all or part of existing Investments or moving into different fields of Investment activity.\"23 Therefore, the first sentence of Article 10(1) concerns the conditions that the Respondent was required to create for the Claimant to carry out new investment activities. In the circumstances of this case, this amounts primarily to a reference to the \"original\" conditions, that is, the conditions that the Respondent had created and existed at the time the Claimant made each of its investments in eolic energy in Spain.\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 1(8).\n\n22.\n\nThe first sentence of Article 10(1) requires that those original conditions be stable, equitable, favourable, and transparent. In this case, however, the Claimant does not allege that the original conditions for each of its investments (which were not necessarily the same) were inequitable, unfavourable, or non-transparent. With the possible exception of the requirement that those conditions be stable, the Claimant\u2019s claims are not based on an alleged inconsistency between the original conditions and the requirements of the first sentence; they concern a subsequent *change*, to the Claimant\u2019s detriment, of (i) the original conditions or (ii) conditions imposed subsequently which the Claimant had accepted or to which it had acquiesced. Therefore, again with the possible exception of the requirement of stability, the first sentence cannot provide a legal basis for the Claimant\u2019s claims.\n\n23.\n\nThe requirement that the original conditions be \"stable\" is different in an important respect from the other requirements set forth in the first sentence. In the case of the other requirements, it is possible to assess at a single point (*e.g.*, at the time the investment was made) whether the original conditions were equitable, favourable, and transparent \u2013 to such degree as may be required. But in the case of the requirement that the original conditions be \"stable,\" it is not possible to assess compliance with the requisite degree of stability until some time should have elapsed. Stability, whatever the required degree, is a quality that the original conditions must possess over time, *i.e.* a certain degree of continuity or lack of change over a certain period. Accordingly, if the stability of the original conditions is affected by the subsequent treatment of the investment, the requirement of the first sentence that the original conditions be \"stable\" may overlap with the requirements of the second sentence concerning the treatment of the investment \"at all times.\" The existence and extent of the overlap will depend on a comparative analysis of the requirement of stability in the first sentence with the requirement of fair and equitable treatment in the second sentence.\n\n24.\n\nI conclude that, aside from the requirement that the original conditions be \"stable,\" the first sentence of Article 10(1) cannot serve as a basis for the Claimant\u2019s claims. In view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to discuss, in the context of the first sentence, the requirement that the original conditions be equitable, favourable, and transparent. The requirement of stability under the first sentence will be examined, for convenience, together with the requirement of fair and equitable treatment under the second sentence.\n\n**2. The Second Sentence**\n--------------------------\n\n**a. The \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" Standard**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe second sentence of Article 10(1) requires a commitment to accord the investment, at all times, fair and equitable treatment. The Majority notes that Article 10(1) has been extensively discussed in earlier decisions and finds little point in going over the same ground. The Majority makes two general observations and immediately goes on to adopt the \"test\" formulated in *Blusun v. Italy*.24\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 312-315.\n\n26.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s first general observation is that the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard does not give tribunals sitting under investment treaties general discretion to impose their own views as to \"fairness\" and \"equity.\"25 This observation is of course correct. Arbitrators do not have the power, under the guise of interpretation, to treat the terms of a treaty as empty vessels in which to pour their own policy preferences or to improve on the textual choices made by the drafters of the treaty. But, as we shall see, neither do they have the power to discard the terms of the treaty and apply instead rules, standards, or tests of their own making.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 314.\n\n27.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s second observation is that the first and second sentences of Article 10(1) embody a legal standard, \"which takes into account the prerogatives and responsibilities of governments as well as the rights and interests of investors, including their interest in stability.\"26 This statement is so general that it is difficult to take issue with it, except to note that it says nothing about what that legal standard exactly is or on what it is based.\n\n*Id.*\n\n28.\n\nThen the Majority adopts as its own the following *dictum* in *Blusun v. Italy* :\n\n\"In the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to grant subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted. But if they are lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.\"27\n\nDecision, \u00b6 315, quoting from **CL-0083**, *Blusun v. Italy*, \u00b6 319(5).\n\n29.\n\nThe *Blusun dictum* then becomes the roadmap for the Majority\u2019s analysis of the Claimant\u2019s claims under the first and second sentences of Article 10(1) and for the ultimate disposition of those claims. I disagree with the so-called *Blusun* \"test\" and the way the Majority applies it, on two levels.\n\n30.\n\nOn a more general and more fundamental level, I perceive no legal or theoretical justification for applying the *Blusun* \"test\" (or any comparable arbitrator-made \"test\" or standard) in place of the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard set forth in the second sentence of Article 10(1). The second sentence requires \"fair and equitable treatment,\" not something else. The *Blusun* \"test\" is in fact a complex arbitrator-made rule, designed to serve as the governing rule for decision in cases concerning subsidies first granted and later modified. That rule is framed in terms of tiered sub-rules, concepts, and criteria which are different from the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard, and the Majority makes no effort to demonstrate that those sub-rules, concepts, and criteria derive from or are otherwise connected (in a manner consistent with the rules of the VCLT) with the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard.\n\n31.\n\nIn fact, the Majority adopts and uses the *Blusun* rule *as a substitute* for the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard. This is incorrect. Just as a tribunal is not authorized to impose its own views concerning what is \"fair\" or \"equitable,\" as the Majority correctly points out, *a fortiori* a tribunal is not authorized to toss aside the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard imposed by the treaty and apply instead a substitute rule, \"test,\" or standard of its own choosing.\n\n32.\n\nOn a more specific level, I find the *Blusun* rule a poor substitute for the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard. If the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard is sometimes criticized on the ground that it is not precise enough, the *Blusun* rule is hardly an improvement. I shall analyse each component of the rule later.28 For the moment, suffice it to note that the concepts of \"necessary to modify\" and \"due regard\" are neither precise nor unambiguous. Nor is it self-evident (i) whether or how the twin restrictions set forth in the *Blusun* rule (proportionality to the aims of the challenged measure and \"due regard\" for the investor\u2019s reliance interests) are related to the concepts of fairness and equity or (ii) if so related, whether, how, or why they are jointly *sufficient* to satisfy the requirement that the treatment be \"fair and equitable.\"\n\n*Infra*, \u00b6\u00b6 43-47.\n\n33.\n\nIt cannot be seriously claimed that the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" is exempt from the need for interpretation. But any interpretation must be done by following the rules of the VCLT, not by adopting a substitute rule or standard unconnected with the text of the treaty. It bears repeating that, under the primary rule of interpretation of the VCLT, the second sentence of Article 10(1) must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms used in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the ECT. I shall discuss each of these elements in turn.\n\n***The Terms***\n---------------\n\n34.\n\nThe terms of the second sentence are: \"*Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment*.\"29 \"Such\" indicates that the term it modifies (\"conditions\") is one that has been referred to previously \u2013 in this case in the preceding sentence. Hence, \"[s]uch conditions\" can only refer to the conditions mentioned in the first sentence, *i.e.* \"stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions.\"30\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 10(1) (emphasis added).\n\n\"Such conditions\" cannot refer to the conditions \"to make Investments,\" that is, to the original conditions for a new investment activity, because the second sentence makes clear that the required treatment must be accorded \"at all times.\"\n\n***Ordinary Meaning***\n----------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment\" is not a particularly difficult issue. Several tribunals have started their analyses by quoting the dictionary meaning of \"fair\" and \"equitable.\"31 I regard that step as not quite necessary, because it is reasonable to assume that most people, and certainly all lawyers, know the ordinary meaning of these terms. The difficulty (if there is one) lies not in a lack of understanding of what \"fair\" or \"equitable\" means in ordinary language, but in the process of applying these concepts to a particular instance of treatment in the circumstances of a particular case. But that difficulty (if it exists) is neither extraordinary nor unsolvable. Applying general concepts like \"fair\" and \"equitable\" is not different in kind from what adjudicators do and have always done: applying general rules and concepts to the circumstances of particular cases.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, **CL-0114**, *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. and Antin Energ\u00eda Termosolar B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31), Award, 15 June 2018, \u00b6 518 (\"\u2018fair\u2019 means \u2018just, unbiased, equitable, impartial, legitimate\"; and \"\u2018equitable\u2019 is defined as \u2018characterised by equity or fairness\u2019, where \u2018equity\u2019 means \u2018fairness; impartiality; even-handed dealing\u2019.\"); **CL-0028**, *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Award, 25 May 2004, \u00b6 113 (\"just\", \"even-handed\", \"unbiased\", \"legitimate\").\n\n36.\n\nIt is sometimes said that the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" expresses a legal concept. That is true, in the sense that this term and cognate terms are frequently used in legal texts and legal discourse, as well as in ordinary language. In fact, by the time the ECT was drafted and opened for signature (17 December 1994), the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" had been used for decades in numerous investment-protection treaties and had been interpreted and applied in multiple arbitral awards. Those awards had frequently linked the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" to various concepts, including consistency, transparency, stability, and respect for objectively reasonable expectations derived from antecedent state action. These observations do not mean, however, that \"fair and equitable treatment\" should be given a special meaning, in the sense of Article 31.4 of the VCLT, because it has not been established in this case that the parties to the ECT intended to adopt any particular exegesis of \"fair and equitable treatment\" made by any pre-December 1994 decision or set of decisions. Much less do these antecedents justify that \"fair and equitable treatment\" be regarded as an open-ended legal concept, the meaning of which should depend on \"evolving\" interpretations adopted by tribunals in pre- or post-ECT decisions, which in any event are not binding on this Tribunal. On the contrary, \"fair and equitable treatment\" must be regarded as a term which had an objective meaning at the time the ECT was framed \u2013 a meaning to be established in good faith under the rules of the VCLT.\n\n***Context***\n-------------\n\n37.\n\nAs already noted, the second sentence of Article 10(1) immediately follows the first sentence and explicitly refers to a term contained therein. Accordingly, the first sentence forms the proximate context of the second, and this context must especially be taken into account in the interpretation of the latter.32 The drafters of the ECT could simply have provided, as other treaties do, that each Contracting Party shall accord at all times fair and equitable treatment to the Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties. Instead of doing so, they chose a more elaborate formulation, which links the commitment to accord fair and equitable treatment to the \"stable, equitable, favourable, and transparent conditions\" referred to in the first sentence.\n\nFor a similar analysis, see, *e.g.*, **RL-0098**, Dissenting Opinion of Kaj Hob\u00e9r in *Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen GmbH, RWE Innogy GmbH, and others v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/1), 20 November 2019 (henceforth, Hob\u00e9r Dissent), \u00b6 6.\n\n38.\n\nThis observation suggests that the drafters understood \"fair and equitable treatment\" to belong to a larger class of \"stable, equitable, favourable, and transparent conditions.\" This does not imply, however, that \"fair and equitable treatment\" is the same as \"stable, equitable, favourable, and transparent conditions\" (\"equitable\" being redundant), because the second sentence does not say so. But this close contextual relationship does indicate that stability, favourability, and transparency (to certain degrees, as will be discussed) are among the relevant factors or circumstances that should be taken into account in determining whether a given instance of treatment is \"fair and equitable.\"\n\n***Object and purpose***\n------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe traditional way of ascertaining the object and purpose of a treaty is to look at any statement of purpose that it might contain. Article 2 of the ECT, titled \"Purpose of the Treaty,\" states that the ECT \"establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the [European Energy] Charter.\"33\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 2.\n\n40.\n\nThe European Energy Charter is a declaration of goals and principles for international cooperation in the energy field, adopted in 1999.34 It consists of a very general statement of goals (Title I: Objectives), a set of more specific (but still general) ideas about pursuing those goals (Title II: Implementation), and a set of undertakings to negotiate certain specific agreements (Title III: Specific Agreements).35\n\n**CL-0001**, European Energy Charter.\n\n**CL-0001**, European Energy Charter, *passim*.\n\n41.\n\nAs regards the protection of foreign investment, the most relevant and specific statement of \"objectives and principles\" can be found in Title II. Paragraph 4 of Title II states that \"it is important for the signatory States to negotiate and ratify legally binding agreements on promotion and protection of investments which ensure a high level of legal security [\u2026].\"36 The ECT is the product of the negotiations called upon by this statement. Accordingly, the reference to the objectives and principles of the European Energy Charter suggests that one purpose sought by the drafters of the ECT was to provide a \"high level of legal security\" to investments.37\n\n**CL-0001**, European Energy Charter, II.4. The immediately preceding paragraph states that \"the signatories will *at national level* provide for a stable, transparent legal framework for foreign investments, in conformity with the relevant international laws and rules on investment and trade.\" *Id.* (emphasis added). This passage plainly refers to actions to be taken internally, at the national level, while the immediately following paragraph (the pertinent part of which is quoted in the text) refers to the negotiation and adoption of the binding international agreements. It follows that the passage concerning actions to be taken at the national level is not relevant to determine the purposes to be served by the binding international agreements.\n\n*Id.*\n\n42.\n\nAnother way of ascertaining the object and purpose of the ECT is to look at the overall structure and content of the treaty, that is, what the treaty actually *does*. What Part III of the ECT fundamentally does is to lay down certain *international* standards which Contracting States are required to observe in their treatment of investments of nationals of other Contracting States. This observation is a sufficient reason to reject, as inconsistent with the object and purpose of the treaty, any interpretation of \"fair and equitable treatment\" that seeks directly or indirectly to reduce the international standards imposed by the ECT to mere observance of the host state\u2019s law.\n\n***Conclusions on the \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" Standard***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe term \"fair and equitable treatment\" must therefore be interpreted in good faith in accordance with its ordinary meaning in the context and in the light of the object and purpose just discussed. Yet, stability, transparency, and favourability are matters of degree, and the goal of providing a \"high level\" of legal security for investments does not indicate a precise point in the metaphorical height-scale of protection. Because these are matters of degree, the preceding observations on context and object and purpose do not imply by any means that for an instance of treatment to be \"fair and equitable\" it must satisfy an *absolute* degree of stability, transparency, or favourability, or to reach an *absolute* height of protection \u2013 if such things are capable of being so measured. In fact, those elements of context and of object and purpose indicate to the interpreter a *direction*, more than a *destination*. The direction is very important, because it indicates the intent of the framers of the ECT. But the destination, the end point, the precise degree of stability, transparency, and favourability required in each particular case is determined by what is \"fair and equitable\" in that case, that is, by the ordinary meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment.\"\n\n44.\n\n\"Fair and equitable\" are the defining attributes of the treatment that the second sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT requires. But these are not *inherent* attributes of a given instance of treatment, in the sense that the date of a regulation or the colour of the paper on which it was written are. What is \"fair and equitable,\" as these terms are ordinarily used, depends on the surrounding circumstances. Barring extreme examples, a given instance of treatment (*i.e.* the same state measure) may be fair and equitable in one set of circumstances and unfair and inequitable in another set of circumstances. That is why prior arbitral decisions regarding \"fair and equitable treatment\" must be approached with particular caution, even if they relate to the same measure under the same treaty, because not all the relevant circumstances in the two cases are necessarily the same.38 Therefore, the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard should be applied in light of *all* the relevant circumstances of the case, not in light of a subset of those circumstances selected by arbitrators and turned into substitute standards.\n\nThe Tribunal takes the view that \"concordant decisions on the interpretation and application of the ECT merit serious consideration, especially if they rise to the level of a *jurisprudence constante*.\" Decision, \u00b6 239. I subscribe to this view in the understanding that prior decisions should be given serious consideration in a critical, not deferential, manner. Each tribunal is entitled to interpret and apply the ECT on the basis of the VCLT and in the light of the arguments presented to it. This is a moot point, however, because arbitral jurisprudence on the matters at issue in this case can hardly be considered concordant or *constante*.\n\n45.\n\nThe preceding conclusion does not require an arbitrator to ignore that, over a span of several decades, tribunals have identified various patterns of treatment as raising questions of fairness and equity. For example, the degree of stability, transparency, or consistency of a given set of treatment conditions may raise such questions and, depending on the remaining circumstances, compel an answer one way or another. It is no accident that the framers of the ECT chose to refer specifically to stable and transparent conditions in the first sentence of Article 10(1). But in the context of the second sentence of Article 10(1), stability, transparency, and consistency are *factors to be taken into account* in a fair-and-equitable-treatment analysis; they are not requirements to be used as a substitute for the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard.\n\n46.\n\nThe same can be said of another widely recognized pattern of treatment which may raise questions of fairness and equity: the frustration of so-called \"legitimate\" expectations.39 This pattern of treatment consists of a complex set of interactions between a state and a foreign investor in which the state (i) takes actions that give rise to objectively reasonable expectations on the part of the investor and then (ii) takes some further action that frustrates those expectations. The Majority relies on a statement in *Blusun* which notes, among other things, that the term \"legitimate expectations\" does not appear in the ECT or other treaties.40 The Majority takes the view that such expectations are essentially *consideranda* : \"they are relevant factors to be taken into account in the interpretation and application of treaty standards such as Article 10(1) of the ECT, first and second sentences.\"41 I agree with this view, insofar as it concerns the application of the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard under the second sentence. The pattern of treatment that the Majority calls \"legitimate\" expectations is relevant to the fair-and-equitable-treatment analysis but does not exhaust all the relevant considerations. The Majority fails to appreciate, however, that if the term \"legitimate expectations\" does not appear in the ECT or other treaties, neither does the *Blusun* rule or any of its components. If the former are properly reduced to mere *consideranda*, a position with which I agree, by the same token the same must be true of the latter.\n\nOn this terminology, see *infra*, \u00b6 79.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 316, quoting *Blusun*, \u00b6 371.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 317.\n\n47.\n\nThe statement in *Blusun* on which the Majority relies ends with the sentence: \"International law does not make binding that which was not binding in the first place, nor render perpetual what was temporary only.\"42 This statement is overbroad. It is important to show where it goes astray, lest it be used (improperly) as an *a priori* constraint on the interpretation of the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard. It is true that *customary* international law does not obligate states to refrain from frustrating objectively reasonable expectations, as the ICJ ruled in *Obligation To Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean* Case,43 but customary international law *does* make binding certain unilateral statements made on behalf of a state that may not be binding otherwise, as the ICJ ruled in the *Nuclear Tests Case*.44 More to the point, absent a violation of *ius cogens* there is no reason of principle why *treaty* law may not make binding what was not binding in the first place (under customary international law or municipal law); it all depends on the terms of the treaty. Therefore, for all its aphoristic qualities, the quoted sentence in *Blusun* cannot be relied upon to foreclose the possibility that the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard of the ECT might have, in certain circumstances, the effect of holding a state to its commitments. The fair-and-equitable-treatment standard of the ECT must be interpreted under the rules of the VCLT, not under *a priori* conceptions about what a treaty may or may not prescribe.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 316, quoting *Blusun*, \u00b6 371.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile)*, Judgment of 1 October 2018, \u00b6 162.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Nuclear Tests Case (Australia v. France)*, Judgment of 20 December 1974, \u00b6\u00b6 43-46.\n\n***The Stability Overlap***\n---------------------------\n\n48.\n\nAs noted, the first sentence of Article 10(1) requires that the conditions for the making of investments be, *inter alia*, \"stable.\" This stability requirement, which can only be assessed over time, may overlap with the obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment at all times, as stability is one of the relevant circumstances to be taken into account in the application of the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard. A stability overlap can only be partial, because the two sentences have different scopes of application (the first applies to the making of investments; the second at all times). The overlap would also depend on the extent to which the meaning of \"stability\" and the required degree of stability are the same under both sentences. In this respect, the use of the same terms and the close contextual relation suggest that both sentences refer to stability in the same sense and to the same degree. Consequently, the discussion on stability in the next subsection is meant to apply to both sentences of Article 10(1).\n\n**b. The Application of the \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\" Standard to the Circumstances of this Case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nAs noted, to determine whether the Disputed Measures meet the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard of the ECT, it is necessary to consider all the relevant circumstances of the case. For the purposes of this Partial Dissent, however, I shall place particular attention to the circumstances which the Majority and I assess differently. To facilitate the analysis, the relevant circumstances can be grouped as follows: (i) circumstances related to the Respondent\u2019s antecedent conduct, *i.e.* its conduct preceding the Disputed Measures; (ii) circumstances related to the Claimant\u2019s conduct, including its expectations and reactions based on the Respondent\u2019s antecedent conduct; and (iii) circumstances related to the Disputed Measures. I shall discuss these three sets of circumstances separately and then draw general conclusions on the application of the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard.\n\n**i. Circumstances Related to the Respondent\u2019s AntecedentConduct**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s relevant antecedent conduct consisted primarily of adopting laws and regulations on the generation of electricity through conversion from eolic energy.45\n\nThe Claimant invokes also certain statements made by a representative of the Xunta in Japan concerning investment in wind plants in Galicia. I agree with the Majority, however, that those statements cannot be invoked as the source of commitments by the Respondent. See Decision, \u00b6 322.\n\n51.\n\nIn the relevant period, that is, the period in which the Claimant made investments in Spain in the eolic sector, the Respondent adopted two statutes and four material royal decrees governing that sector. Those statutes and royal decrees established four successive legal regimes, each consisting of (i) a statute establishing a general legal framework for the regulation of this subject and (ii) a royal decree \"developing\" the statute, *i.e.* regulating the same matters in greater detail, within the general parameters of the statute. The last three legal regimes included, and were based on, the same statute.\n\n52.\n\nThose four successive legal regimes were the following:\n\n\u2022 First Regime, consisting of Law 40/1994 and RD 2366/1994.\n\n\u2022 Second Regime, consisting of Law 54/1997 and RD 2818/1998.\n\n\u2022 Third Regime, consisting of Law 54/1997 and RD 436/2004.\n\n\u2022 Fourth Regime, consisting of Law 54/1997 and RD 661/2007.\n\n53.\n\nThe First, Second, and Third Regimes are primarily relevant to an analysis of the Claimant\u2019s conduct, a topic which will be addressed separately. For the purposes of the present discussion, the Fourth is the most relevant legal regime. The Fourth Regime (with a relatively minor change introduced later by RD 1614/2010)46 was in effect at the time the Disputed Measures were adopted and was replaced by those measures. If the Disputed Measures breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment under the ECT, it must be because (*inter alia*) they abrogated the Fourth Regime, not the preceding three regimes, which had generally ceased to be in effect long before the Respondent adopted the Disputed Measures.\n\n**C-0010**, RD 1614/2010. The changes introduced by this Royal Decree are discussed *infra*, \u00b6 85. The Claimant asserts that these changes had no significant effect on its investment. Claimant\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 126.\n\n54.\n\nTwo fundamental questions must be asked in respect of the Fourth Regime:\n\na. *Commitments:* whether the regime set forth one or more commitments, undertakings, promises, assurances, guarantees, or other forms of representation (to be collectively referred to as commitments) that the investors or investments in the eolic energy sector would be treated in a certain way, including any commitment concerning the duration of any such treatment; and\n\nb. *Specificity:* how specific were any such commitments.\n\n***Commitments***\n-----------------\n\n55.\n\nThe question whether the Fourth Regime contained commitments requires an objective answer, based on what the Respondent said and did in adopting that regime. The Claimant\u2019s understanding of any such commitments and any expectations it derived therefrom are separate matters, to be discussed later as circumstances related to the Claimant\u2019s conduct.47\n\nAccordingly, I cannot agree with the Majority\u2019s view that the Claimant\u2019s current position (it expected stability, not immutability) has a bearing on the *existence* and *extent* of commitments made in RD 661/2007. See Decision, \u00b6 324 and n. 430.\n\n56.\n\nThe Fourth Regime consisted of Law 54/1997 and RD 661/2007. Law 54/1997 established a special regime for the generation of electricity from wind and other renewable sources, a pattern which had been adopted by the predecessor statute. The special-regime producers were entitled to sell their energy at a price consisting of (i) a component determined by a market-price mechanism and (ii) a premium (*prima*) to be determined by the Government on the basis of certain criteria.48 Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 established the legal framework for the premiums:\n\n\"*Adicionalmente, la producci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica mediante energ\u00edas renovables no hidr\u00e1ulicas* [\u2026] *percibir\u00e1[] una prima que se fijar\u00e1 por el Gobierno de forma que el precio de la electricidad vendida por estas instalaciones se encuentre dentro de una banda porcentual comprendida entre el 80 y el 90 por 100 de un precio medio de la electricidad, que se calcular\u00e1 dividiendo los ingresos derivados de la facturaci\u00f3n por suministro de electricidad entre la energ\u00eda suministrada.* [\u2026]\n\n*Para la determinaci\u00f3n de las primas se tendr\u00e1 en cuenta el nivel de tensi\u00f3n de entrega de la energ\u00eda a la red, la contribuci\u00f3n efectiva a la mejora del medio ambiente, el ahorro de energ\u00eda primaria y a la eficiencia energ\u00e9tica, y los costes de inversi\u00f3n en que se haya incurrido, al efecto de conseguir unas tasas de rentabilidad razonables con referencia al coste del dinero en el mercado de capitales.*\"49\n\n**C-0004** or **R-0003**, Arts. 16.1 and 30.\n\n*Id.*, Art. 30.4. (My literal translation of this passage is as follows: \"In addition, the production of electric energy by means of non-hydraulic renewable energies [\u2026] shall receive a premium which shall be fixed by the Government in such a way that the price of electricity sold by these installations fall within a percentage band between 80 and 90 percent of an average electricity price, which shall be calculated dividing the revenues derived from invoicing for the supply of electricity by the electricity supplied. [\u2026] To determine the premiums, there shall be taken into account the voltage level at which the energy is delivered to the network, the effective contribution to the improvement of the environment, to the savings of primary energy, and to energy efficiency, and the investment costs incurred, with the purpose of achieving reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market.\")\n\n57.\n\nThe Majority takes the view that the second transcribed paragraph, which it quotes in a non-literal translation, states a \"coherent general principle,\" which \"imposes some limits on what can be done.\"50 The Majority acknowledges that Law 54/1997 empowered the administration to establish the premium by regulation, but argues that \"[t]he stream cannot rise higher than its source or commit the state to more than the legislative framework allows.\"51 On this basis, the Majority concludes that Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 is inconsistent with the thesis that particular Royal Decrees, notably RD 661/2007, stabilized the regime.52\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 331, 334.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 334.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 331.\n\n58.\n\nThe metaphor that \"the stream cannot rise higher than its source\" and the reference to what \"the legislative framework allows\" suggest that the Majority considers a regulation such as RD 661/2007 incapable of setting forth a commitment unless such a commitment has been expressly authorized by the statute. The Majority\u2019s legal theory appears to be, then, that for the purposes of expressing a commitment, any provision of RD 661/2007 (or any other Royal Decree issued under Law 54/1997) that purported to \"stabilize\" the regime (*i.e.* to give any aspect of it a specified duration) was *ultra vires* and therefore either invalid under Spanish law or otherwise to be disregarded. This theory, to be addressed in the following paragraphs, appears to be different from a related argument, to be discussed later in connection with the Claimant\u2019 expectations, that those provisions of RD 661/2007 could not have given rise to \"legitimate\" expectations, because they were subject to being amended or repealed by later Royal Decrees or other norms of a higher rank, as in fact they 53 were.53\n\n*Infra*, \u00b6\u00b6 101-102.\n\n59.\n\nIn my view, the Majority\u2019s theory is based on a misreading of the relevant legal texts and a flawed reasoning based on that misreading. To show why, we must first examine Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 closely and then compare it with the provisions of RD 661/2007. A close examination of Article 30.4 leads to the following observations.\n\n60.\n\nThe first observation is an obvious point, but its consequences are often overlooked. Article 30.4 established norms of two different kinds. First, it provided that the producers were to receive a premium over the price for the energy sold, which means that it gave the producers a *right* to such a premium. This was a primary norm (or norm of conduct), that is, the kind of norm that creates rights and imposes obligations on persons subject thereto. The right created by that primary norm was, however, the right to *a* premium, not to a *particular, specified* premium. For the creation of the latter, Article 30.4 delegated on the Government the setting of the premium, while specifying certain criteria that the Government had to take into account in fulfilling that task. This was a secondary norm (or norm of competence), that is, a norm that empowered another organ of the system to set the premium, subject to those criteria.\n\n61.\n\nThe criteria which the Government had to apply in setting the premium included various factors to be considered (voltage level on delivery to the network, contribution to the improvement of the environment, contribution to savings of primary energy, contribution to energy efficiency, and cost incurred in the investment) and an overall objective: \"to achieve reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market.\" These criteria were not addressed to the producers; they were directed to the Government\u2019s conduct in setting the premium. Further, applying these criteria was not a mathematical exercise; it involved an exercise of judgment and a weighing of competing factors within a complex process of technical evaluation, quantification, and assessment of how eolic energy furthered certain economic and policy goals. Accordingly, setting the premium was an act of governmental rulemaking; it was not a mere deductive exercise from the content of Article 30.4.\n\n62.\n\nFor these reasons alone, it cannot be right to consider, as the Majority does, that any right (or \"legitimate\" expectation) that the producers had in respect of the premium had to be based solely on Article 30.4. Put differently, it is a mistake to regard Article 30.4 as the sum total of a producer\u2019s rights under the Fourth Regime (or the sole source of an investor\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations) and to treat the regulations thereunder as something that can safely be disregarded. In fact, the setting of the premium, as a separate governmental act, was an integral component of the legal regime established by the Law.\n\n63.\n\nA second observation is that the criteria set forth in Article 30.4 concern only the *quantum* of the premium to be established by the Government. Law 54/1997 said nothing about the *timing* for setting the premium or the *duration* of the premium once set. In particular, the Law did not require the Government to establish that premium annually (as Law 40/1994 had done) or to establish or revise it at any time or at any particular intervals. Nor did Law 54/1997 debar the Government from designating a particular duration for the premium or for any element of the calculation. Because by necessity the setting of the premium had to happen at some time and the premium had to have some duration, it must be concluded that timing and duration are matters which the legislature deliberately left open, to be determined by the Government in the exercise of its regulatory function.\n\n64.\n\nA third observation is that Article 30.4 set forth the criteria that the Government had to take into account in *setting* the premium. It did not require that the premium, once set, had to conform to those criteria at all times. Any such requirement would have been unworkable, of course, because some components of the criteria vary continually over time. It must be understood, then, that the criteria of Article 30.4 were to be applied in setting the premium for the first time and in any later revisions. But since Article 30.4 did not require that the premium be revised at any particular intervals, it did not exclude the possibility that the premium might be established (on the basis of the designated criteria) as a variable premium to be adjusted in accordance with an index.\n\n65.\n\nA fourth, and most important, observation is that, under the criteria set forth in Article 30.4, \"achiev[ing] reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market\" was the overall objective *of the process for setting the amount of the premium*.54 It was not an overall target imposed by the statute *on the actual financial results* of any producer in the special regime. Therefore, there is no basis in Article 30.4, or elsewhere in the statute, for the contention that the overall objective of reasonable rates of return referred to in the statute worked as a ceiling (or a floor, for that matter) on the *actual* rate of return that a producer was entitled or permitted to have (or could reasonably expect) in any particular period or over the entire duration of the investment. In this respect, the tribunal in *Cube* correctly read Article 30.4, and the Majority\u2019s disagreement with that decision cannot be based on the actual words of the statute.55\n\n**C-0004** or **R-0003**, Law 54/1997, Art. 30.4 (\"***Para la determinaci\u00f3n de las primas** se tendr\u00e1 en cuenta el nivel de tensi\u00f3n de entrega de la energ\u00eda a la red, la contribuci\u00f3n efectiva a la mejora del medio ambiente, el ahorro de energ\u00eda primaria y a la eficiencia energ\u00e9tica, y los costes de inversi\u00f3n en que se haya incurrido, **al efecto de conseguir unas tasas de rentabilidad razonables con referencia al coste del dinero en el mercado de capitales**.*\") (emphasis added).\n\n**RL-0090**, *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV and others v.

In particular, we do not consider that the references to a \"reasonable return\" signified a limit on the profit that a producer could earn from any power facility or group of facilities without suffering a reduction or lower-than-normal increase in tariffs, or that the references provided any basis for changes to the 2007 Regime outside the mechanisms set out in RD 661/2007.\"); Decision, \u00b6 332 (disagreeing with the quoted statement in *Cube*, also quoted in footnote, without referring to the text of Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997).\n\n66.\n\nThe other principal component of the Fourth Regime is Royal Decree 661/2007. This Royal Decree set forth a comprehensive, highly detailed regulation for the generation of electrical energy from a variety of sources, including wind. The producers of electricity from eolic energy (group b.2) had the right to choose between receiving (i) a regulated tariff or (ii) a market or negotiated price plus a premium.56 The alternative selected had to be in effect for at least one year.57 As for the first alternative, RD 661/2007 established that eolic plants installed on land (group b.2.1) would be entitled to a regulated tariff of 7.3228 c\u20ac/Kwh for the first 20 years and of 6.1200 c\u20ac/Kwh thereafter (\"*a partir de entonces*\").58 As for the second alternative, the Royal Decree established a variable premium, which depended, in part, on the \"reference market price,\" a concept defined in the decree.59 The actual premium to be applied would be a \"reference premium,\" but this premium, added to the reference market price, could not exceed an upper limit or fall below a lower limit set forth in the decree.60 For eolic plants installed on land (group b.2.b), RD 661/2007 established, for the first 20 years, a reference premium of 2.9291 c\u20ac/Kwh, an upper limit of 8.4944 c\u20ac/Kwh, and a lower limit of 7.1275 c\u20ac/Kwh.61 After the first 20 years, the reference premium would be zero.62 These amounts would be adjusted annually according to any increase in the national consumer-price index (IPC) minus (i) 25 basis points until 31 December 2012 or (ii) 50 basis points thereafter.63\n\n**C-0008** or **R-0101**, RD 661/2007, Art. 24.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*, Art. 36.\n\n*Id.*, Art. 27.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*, Art. 36.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*, Art. 44.1 and First Additional Provision.\n\n67.\n\nArticle 44.3 of RD 661/2007 regulated the revision of the regime described above. It provided that the tariffs, premiums, upper and lower limits, and other add-ons would be revised in 2010 and thereafter every four years.64 Nevertheless, it provided that a revision of the regulated tariff or the upper and lower limits (but not including the reference premium) would not affect existing plants:\n\n\"*Las revisiones a las que se refiere este apartado de la tarifa regulada y de los l\u00edmites superior e inferior no afectar\u00e1n a las instalaciones cuya puesta en servicio se hubiera otorgado antes del 1 de enero del segundo a\u00f1o posterior al a\u00f1o en que se haya efectuado la revisi\u00f3n*.\"65\n\n*Id.*, Art. 44.3.

The producer had to make an irrevocable choice between the two options granted by the preceding regime: (i) selling electricity to the distribution company at a regulated tariff or (ii) selling it to the market at the market price plus a premium.66 If the producer chose the first option, the regulated tariffs of RD 661/2007 would not apply.67 If the producer chose the second option, the premium established under the Third Regime would continue to apply for a transition period ending on 31 December 2012.68 In either case, the producer could opt into the regime of RD 661/2007, in which case that regime would apply *in toto*.69\n\n*Id.*, First Transitory Provision (1).\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*, First Transitory Provision (3).\n\n69.\n\nThe preceding review leads to the following conclusions, based on the plain texts of Law 54/1997 and RD 661/2007. Law 54/1997 (i) set forth a commitment that the relevant producers would receive a premium over the market price of the energy sold, and (ii) left to the Government the setting of the premium, subject to certain specified criteria on quantum. Royal Decree 661/2007 \"developed\" the regime of the law by setting forth a commitment to a remuneration regime comprising two alternatives, at the producer\u2019s choice: (i) a regulated tariff or rate (which would have taken into account the premium, to make it a realistic choice) or (ii) a variable premium calculated on the basis of quantified factors. Royal Decree 661/2007 also set forth a commitment on the duration of each alternative and a commitment that future revisions of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits (but not including the regulated premium) would not affect existing plants.70\n\nTo the same effect, see **RL-0093**, *OperaFund Eco-Invest SICAV PLC and Schwab Holding AG v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/36), Award, 6 September 2019, \u00b6 485 (henceforth, *OperaFund*) (\"[I]t is hard to imagine a more explicit stabilization assurance than the one mentioned in Article 44(3)\").\n\n70.\n\nWe can now assess the Majority\u2019s view that the duration and stability commitments set forth by RD 661/2007 should be disregarded to the extent not expressly contemplated in Law 54/1997. As the Majority\u2019s position could be interpreted in two different ways, I shall consider both alternatives.\n\n71.\n\nFirst, the Majority\u2019s position could be that those commitments in RD 661/2007 were invalid *ab initio* as a matter of *Spanish law*. Any such contention would be unsustainable, for various reasons. The Respondent does not claim that RD 661/2007 was, in whole or in part, invalid *ab initio* as inconsistent with Law 54/1997; it argues instead that RD 661/2007 was validly superseded by later norms of the same or higher rank.71 Nor is there any evidence on the record that the Spanish courts declared RD 661/2007 null and void *ab initio* as contrary to Law 54/1997. It is also highly doubtful that the Tribunal might have jurisdiction to decide, *as a matter of Spanish law*, that the presumption of legality of RD 661/2007 must be overridden and certain portions of the decree be declared *ultra vires* and invalid *ab initio*.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 299-301 (summarizing Respondent\u2019s arguments, centred on the possibility and validity of regulatory change). The Respondent argues separately that RD 661/2007 was invalid under EU law because it was part of a subsidies regime that was not notified to the EC. That contention is analysed *infra*, \u00b6 125.\n\n72.\n\nSecond, the Majority\u2019s position could be that, as a matter of interpretation and application of the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard of the ECT, a commitment made in a Royal Decree should be disregarded if not expressly authorized by the respective statute. The Majority offers no basis for any such contention, other than the metaphor that \"the stream cannot rise higher than its source.\"72 The metaphor is inapposite, however, because the source of the Government\u2019s power to regulate is Article 97 of the Spanish Constitution, not (or not only) the relevant statute.73 In the Spanish system, in which a statute like Law 54/1997 provides a general framework to be supplemented or \"developed\" by detailed regulations, it is unjustified, as well as unrealistic, to expect that every aspect of the regulations will be foreseen and provided for in the statute. To be sure, in the Spanish system the regulations may not *contradict* the provisions of the statute, but the preceding analysis has shown that there is no inconsistency between the commitments made in RD 661/2007 and the provisions of Law 54/1997.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 334.\n\nConstituci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, Art. 97 (\"El Gobierno [\u2026] [e]jerce la funci\u00f3n ejecutiva y la potestad reglamentaria de acuerdo con la Constituci\u00f3n y las leyes.\"), http://www.senado.es/web/conocersenado/normas/constitucion/index.html. My literal translation: \"The Government [\u2026] exercises the executive function and the regulatory power in accordance with the Constitution and the laws.\"\n\n73.\n\nTherefore, I perceive no valid reason for an arbitral tribunal to disregard the commitments set forth in RD 661/2007. It remains to be determined whether, and to what extent, the commitments made in the Fourth Regime are sufficiently specific.\n\n***Specificity***\n-----------------\n\n74.\n\nThe specificity of a commitment is quintessentially a matter of degree. The degree of specificity of a commitment is one of the circumstances that should be taken into account in assessing whether a particular instance of treatment meets the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard. Other things being equal, the less specific the commitment, the more difficult it would be to find that any expectations based thereon were objectively reasonable and, ultimately, that a subsequent measure breaching that commitment amounted to unfair and inequitable treatment.\n\n75.\n\nBy contrast, the *Blusun* rule and other similar rules treat the specificity of a commitment as an all-or-nothing factor, working as a diverting valve which, depending on the way it is set, leads the analysis through one conduit or another. In fact, the *Blusun* rule is a default rule, which purports to apply \"[i]n the absence of a specific commitment.\"74 The Majority does not explain what kind or degree of specificity would be sufficient to make a commitment \"specific.\" Nor does the Majority explain what legal consequences would follow from a \"specific commitment,\" although it can be surmised that the breach of such a commitment would amount to unfair and inequitable treatment, unless perhaps other (unstated) factors might change that result. In any event, the Majority seems to take the view that the *Blusun* rule comes into play because the commitments of RD 661/2007 should be disregarded or treated as non-existent, not because they were not sufficiently specific.75 Since I have concluded that those commitments did exist and cannot be disregarded, the question of specificity becomes critical even for the purposes of the *Blusun* rule and other similar approaches that turn on the existence of specific commitments.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 315, quoting from *Blusun*, \u00b6 319(5).\n\nDecision, \u00b6 321. This leads the Majority to the odd result that the highly specific commitments of RD 661/2007 are disregarded, while the much less specific criteria of Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 are treated as the state\u2019s sole relevant antecedent conduct.\n\n76.\n\nIn this regard, it cannot be denied that the commitments set forth in RD 661/2007 and hence those contained in the Fourth Regime as a whole are highly specific. They are highly specific in respect of the content of the commitments: the *quantum* of the remuneration to which the producers were entitled, the *duration* of the specified quantum, and the *exemption* of existing plants from future revisions to certain key components of the specified remuneration.76 Those commitments are also highly specific in respect of the *beneficiarie* s of the commitments, *i.e.* the class of producers validly registered in the RAIPRE as beneficiaries of the special regime.77\n\nTo the same effect, see **CL-0112**, *Novenergia II \u2013 Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), SICAR v. Kingdom of Spain* (SCC Arbitration 2015/063), Award, 15 February 2018 (henceforth, *Novenergia II*), \u00b6\u00b6 665-667 (\"The commitment from the Kingdom of Spain could not have been clearer\"); Haigh Dissent, \u00b6 10.\n\nFor similar conclusions, see, *e.g.*, **CL-0117**, *9REN Holding S.a\u0300.r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/15), Award, 31 May 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 257, 295; **CL-0113**, *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1), Award, 16 May 2018, \u00b6 512; Haigh Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 50-52.\n\n77.\n\nThe preceding review of the Respondent\u2019s relevant antecedent conduct leads to the following conclusion: by adopting the Fourth Regime comprising Law 54/1997 and RD 661/2007, the Respondent made highly specific commitments to the producers of electricity from eolic energy in respect of the remuneration to which the producers would be entitled, including the quantum of the remuneration, the duration thereof, and the exemption of existing plants from any future changes affecting certain components of the remuneration.\n\n**ii. Circumstances Related to the Claimant\u2019s Conduct**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe relevant circumstances related to the Claimant\u2019s conduct comprise the Claimant\u2019s reactions (including its objectively reasonable expectations) in respect of the legal regime existing at the time of each investment and any subsequent changes to that regime. The Claimant\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations in respect of those legal regimes and any commitments they contained are important *consideranda* in a proper analysis under the standard of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n79.\n\nI should start with an explanation of the term \"objectively reasonable expectations.\" I am not aware of any substantive difference between what the Majority means by \"legitimate expectations\" and what I mean by \"objectively reasonable expectations.\" But I prefer to use the latter term, which is more descriptive, and avoid the ubiquitous, overused, ambiguous adjective \"legitimate.\"78 The concept, which I believe to be generally accepted regardless of the terminology used, is that an investor\u2019s expectations are relevant to the fair-and-equitable-treatment analysis only to the extent that they are reasonable from an objective standpoint, that is, the standpoint of a reasonable investor in the circumstances.79\n\nWhen we use the term \"legitimate,\" we do so by reference to an underlying criterion of legitimacy, which may be made explicit or not. In the absence of an explicit reference to a criterion of legitimacy, it is not clear whether the underlying criterion is a moral or religious code, or a legal system, or a political theory, or a particular custom, or a dynastic principle, etc. Leaving the reference open carries the risk of a later redefinition of the term through switching the criterion of reference.\n\nSee **CL-0023**, *Ioan Micula and others v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20), Final Award, 11 December 2013 (henceforth, *Micula*), \u00b6 669 (\"Whether a state has created a legitimate expectation in an investor is thus a factual assessment which must be undertaken in consideration of all the surrounding circumstances.\")\n\n80.\n\nThe critical issues to be considered in this subsection are: (i) whether the relevant expectations of the Claimant are limited to those which arose at the time of the initial investment or may also include those which arose in connection with each change of legal regime; and (ii) whether expectations based on commitments set forth in Royal Decrees were objectively reasonable.\n\n***Timing of the Expectations***\n--------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe Majority takes the view that \"as a matter of general principle, a legitimate expectation is a form of reliance interest which must relate to facts or circumstances in existence at the time the investment is made.\"80 This view is correct when applied to the usual case, in which the legal regime existing at the time of the investment and the expectations derived therefrom are abrogated or destroyed by the subsequent measures on which the claim is based. But in a case of a long-term investment which has been subjected to successive intermediate legal regimes, it is unrealistic and artificial to limit consideration of the investor\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations to those held at the beginning of the process, based on a legal framework that may have long been repealed by the time the questioned measures were imposed. As already noted, whether a particular instance of treatment is fair and equitable depends on all the relevant circumstances, not on a subset of them selected by a rigid arbitrator-made rule.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 324.\n\n82.\n\nThe Majority rejects the possibility that \"legitimate\" expectations might change in the course of the investment on two grounds: (i) those expectations need not always change in the direction more favourable to the investor, and (ii) if the expectations can change in both directions, they would simply \"track the state of the law from time to time, and the idea of a reliance interest would lose all autonomy.\"81 The first observation is of course correct but the second is not. The investor\u2019s expectations need not track the state of the law, because they depend on the investor\u2019s attitude and decisions concerning each change in the law, a point to which I shall presently return. Further, the supposed \"autonomy\" of the notion of reliance cannot mean that reliance can be predicated only in reference to the state of affairs at the time of the initial investment. An investor can rely on something (such as a state commitment) for its initial decision to invest, but that reliance does not prevent the investor from relying on something else (such as another state commitment) for a subsequent decision concerning the investment.82 As will be seen, long-term investments like those in the present case present a more complex reality, which a proper analysis must take into account.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 324.\n\nSee **CL-0046**, C. Schreuer and U. Kriebaum, \"At What Time Must Legitimate Expectations Exist?\" in J. Werner and A. Hyder Ali (eds.), *A Liber Amicorum: Thomas W\u00e4lde* (2009), pp. 273-274 (\"A foreign investor may be presumed to know the general regulatory framework prevalent in a country at the time it first embarks upon the investment. But it is not only the framework existing at that early stage that can create legitimate expectations. If there are favourable changes to the legal framework during the establishment or during the lifetime of the investment, this may also create legitimate expectations which will be protected if the foreign investor relies on them in subsequent business decision [*sic*].\") The same reasoning should apply to *unfavourable* changes to the legal framework in which the investor acquiesces. One possible exception, depending on the circumstances, may be \"creeping\" detrimental changes which may not individually justify a challenge but in their combined effect may amount to unfair and inequitable treatment. This hypothetical situation, which is analogous with that of \"creeping\" expropriation, does not correspond to the facts of the present case.\n\n83.\n\nIt is undisputed that the individual wind farms on which the Claimant invested were approved and commissioned at different times, under various legal regimes.83 Depending on the date of approval or start of operations, each individual wind farm in the Claimant\u2019s inventory was subject to one, two, three, or four successive legal regimes in the period preceding the Disputed Measures.84 To simplify the analysis, let us take the three oldest plants (Pax I and II A, Barbanza, and Vicedo), which were approved under the First Regime, although they came into operation under the Second.85 Progressively simpler versions of the same analysis will apply to the newer plants, which were subject to fewer changes in the applicable legal regime.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, Appendix II.\n\nCompare *id.* with the dates on which each successive regime took effect.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, Appendix II.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s expectations at the time of its initial investment in the three oldest plants derived from the First Regime (Law 40/1994 and RD 2366/1994), which was in force at the time. That legal regime was later superseded by the Second Regime (Law 54/1997 and RD 2818/1998), which was superseded by the Third Regime (Law 54/1997 and RD 436/2004), which was superseded by the Fourth Regime (Law 54/1997 and RD 661/2007), which was amended, in a relatively minor way, by RD 1614/2010. Each time the legal regime was changed, the investor faced a business decision, which was informed, in part, by (objectively reasonable) expectations concerning the treatment to be afforded by the new regime and, in particular, by the revenues to be expected from the level of subsidies to be paid thereunder.\n\n85.\n\nSuch a business decision involved, in a very real sense, the acceptance or non-acceptance of the new regime, a decision based, at least in part, on the (objectively reasonable) expectations derived from that regime. If the investor was given the choice of remaining under the old regime or to opt into the new one (as the Second and Third Regimes and to some extent the Fourth Regime did),86 the investor had to make that choice, and if it opted to come under the new regime (whether more or less favourable to its interests), it cannot seriously be denied that its expectations going forward would be those derived from the new regime. On the contrary, if the Government imposed the new regime on existing investors (as it did generally in the case of RD 661/2007 and fully in the case of RD 1614/2010)87, the investor had to decide whether to acquiesce in the new regime, or to contest it under the local law or under the ECT, or to sell the investment. In making that business decision, the investor would have to take into account a variety of factors, including the expectations derived from the new regime as compared with the expectations created by the old one. If for any reason the investor decided to keep the investment and to acquiesce in the new regime, it is unrealistic to ignore the expectations created by the new regime and unreasonable to insist that the sole expectations that count are those generated by the previous, no longer applicable regime.\n\n**C-0004** or **R-0003**, Law 54/1997, Eighth Transitory Provision (producers under the preceding regime would continue to be subject thereto, for as long as a certain compensatory scheme for certain other producers remained in effect, but could opt into the remuneration regime of the new law); **C-0005**, RD 2818/1998, First Transitory Provision (producers under the preceding regime would continue to be subject thereto, but could opt into the remuneration regime of the decree); **C-0007**, RD 436/2004, Second Transitory Provision (producers under the regime of RD 2366/1994 [First Regime] would be generally exempt from the regime of the new decree, except that they would have the right to sell energy to the market and could opt into the entire regime of the new decree; producers under the regime of RD 2818/1998 [Second Regime] would continue to be subject to the previous remuneration regime for a transition period of about 6 years, but could opt into the regime of the new decree.); **C-0008** or **R-0101**, RD 661/2007, First Transitory Provision (producers under the regime of RD 436/2004 would continue to generally subject to that regime for a transition period but could opt into the new regime; in all other respects, the new regime generally replaced the previous one, which was repealed.)\n\n**C-0008** or **R-0101**, RD 661/2007, First Transitory Provision (see preceding note); **C-0010**, RD 1614/2010 (Article 2 imposed reference limits on the number of hours of production for which the producer would be entitled to the premium or premium equivalent. Article 5 generally reduced, for a designated period, the reference premium applicable to certain installations under RD 661/2007.)\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s description of the facts, its insistence in the unity of its investments, and its reliance on the Fourth Regime, portrayed as the apex of the evolution of a unitary system of incentives provided to the eolic-energy sector in Spain \u2013 all indicate that the Claimant accepted every legal regime to which its investments were successively subjected, until the Disputed Measures.88 Whether the Claimant regarded each new regime as more or less favourable than its predecessor is immaterial, because it appears that the Claimant did not contest the new regime or sell any of its investments. Notably, the Claimant appears to have embraced the Fourth Regime and the amendment of RD 1614/2010 unreservedly, even though they were generally imposed on its existing investments *nolens volens*.89 Therefore, it must be concluded that at the time the Claimant ceased investing in Spain, it had acquiesced in the application of the Fourth Regime to all of its investments and had adjusted its expectations to the terms of that regime.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, Claimant\u2019s Memorial, *passim* (treating the \"Incentives Regime\" as a unit); \u00b6\u00b6 46, 216 (RD 661/2007 \"final update to the Incentives Regime\"), 197 (investment should be considered as an \"indivisible whole\"), 204 (expectation that the Claimant\u2019s projects would continue to benefit from a regime at least as favourable as that of RD 661/2007).\n\nThe Fourth Regime was imposed on existing projects after a transition period. **CW-5**, Supplemental Witness Statement of Tetsuya Suwabe, \u00b6 7 (\"Although we opted to continue to receive remuneration under the scheme set out in Royal Decree 436/2004 for all the projects (except for the Grallas project) that were entitled to do so, the further confirmation of stability provided by Royal Decree 661/2007 directly contributed to Eurus\u2019 ongoing decision to stay in Spain. We were particularly reassured by the fact that Eurus\u2019 wind power facilities that chose to remain under the 2004 regime would later be entitled to the incentives regime defined by Royal Decree 661/2007, once the latter\u2019s transitional period was over. As a result, Eurus did not pursue or consider a sale of its interests in any of the SPCs.\").\n\n87.\n\nIt is clear that, in the end, the Claimant\u2019s expectations were based on the Fourth Regime, as amended by RD 1614/2010.90 Yet it is also clear, by the Claimant\u2019s own admission, that its expectations did not exactly coincide with the terms of that regime. The Claimant appears to have expected that in the future its investments would be subject to conditions not significantly worse than those set forth in the Fourth Regime, as amended by RD 1614/2010.91 Further, the Claimant has stated that it did not expect that regime to be \"frozen\" or \"petrified\" but that any subsequent change would be either more favourable to its interests or at least would not destroy its business model without compensation.92 Therefore, the Claimant appears to have expected that the amended Fourth Regime would be *stable*, as distinguished from *immutable*.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, Claimant\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 204, 213-214; Claimant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 239-240.\n\n*Id.*\n\nSee, *e.g.*, Claimant\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 240; Decision, n. 422.\n\n***Objective Reasonableness***\n------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe next question is whether the Claimant\u2019s expectations based on the Fourth Regime can be considered to be objectively reasonable. The Majority considers that no \"legitimate\" expectations could have derived from RD 661/2007, for two basic reasons: (i) that such expectations must be based on the legal regime that existed at the time of the investment, which for all but one of the Claimant\u2019s plants was an earlier regime;93 and (ii) that the regime of RD 661/2007 was subject to change within the framework of Law 54/1997, and there could have been no \"legitimate\" expectation that existing plants would be grandfathered.94 The Majority\u2019s first reason does not apply in the complex circumstances of this case, as explained in the preceding subsection.95 The Majority\u2019s second reason, which can be referred to as the \"revocability argument,\" broadly coincides with the Respondent\u2019s position on this matter. It will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 333.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 332-333 (citing a 2005 decision of the Spanish Supreme Court to that effect). The Majority also states that regulations \"[had] change[d] and not in any uniform direction favouring the recipients.\" *Id.*, \u00b6 331. The Majority also mentions in this context that \"the stream cannot rise higher than its source or commit the state to more than the legislative framework allows.\" Decision, \u00b6 334. As already discussed, this argument is more properly analysed as one against the existence of specific commitments arising out of RD 661/2007. For the reasons already explained, this argument is invalid. *Supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 75-77.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 81-87.\n\n89.\n\nThere is no doubt that, *as a matter of Spanish law*, the Respondent had the general legal power or authority to amend or repeal, through the appropriate organs and procedures, each component of the Fourth Regime, in particular Law 54/1997 and RD 661/2007. Moreover, the Claimant was aware of the existence of that general power96 or at any rate should have been aware of it, because it concerned a fundamental feature of the host country\u2019s legal system, not an obscure rule or unsettled point of law. What appears to have been unsettled at first was whether the exercise of such power would require compensation to injured producers,97 but in late 2005 the Supreme Court issued a decision from which it could be inferred that a change in the regulations within the framework of Law 54/1997 would not give affected producers a right to compensation under Spanish law.98\n\nSee **C-0049**, BHV Memorandum, October 2002, p. 77 (referring to an opinion of the Landwell law firm to the effect that Spanish legislation gave the producers of renewable energy certain rights, which constituted acquired rights, so that *any reversal of such rights* would obligate the Government to provide compensation) (emphasis added).\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*; see **RL-0137**, *2005 Judgment* (producers do not have an unmodifiable right that the specific system of remuneration will stay the same).\n\n90.\n\nThe question is, however, whether *as a matter of application of the standards of the ECT*, the mere existence of that general power under domestic law is enough to foreclose any objectively reasonable expectations based on a state commitment that such power will not be exercised in certain respects and for a certain period. The answer must be negative, for the following reasons:\n\na. First, to say that the Government had or retained its general power under Spanish law to amend or repeal RD 661/2007 is to say that the commitments set forth in that Royal Decree were not binding on the Government as a matter of Spanish law. But a state commitment need not be binding under domestic law to be one of the circumstances to be considered in a fair-and-equitable-treatment analysis. Fair and equitable treatment is not limited to compliance with legal obligations under domestic law. Consequently, even though the commitments made in RD 661/2007 were revocable as a matter of Spanish law, that revocability in itself does not foreclose the possibility that they might have created objectively reasonable expectations.\n\nb. Second, from the standpoint of a reasonable investor trying to ascertain the Respondent\u2019s intent in making the commitments set forth in RD 661/2007, only three alternatives are apparent: either (i) the state made those commitments with the intent of repudiating them at a later time; or (ii) the state made those commitments with the intent of complying with them initially, but with the (unstated) reservation that it may well change its mind in the future and repudiate them; or (iii) the state made those commitments with the intent of complying with them in accordance with their terms. The first alternative must be discarded; it would be an instance of bad faith, which cannot be presumed and has not been proved in this case. The second alternative must also be discarded; the principle of transparency would have required the state to disclose that it intended to honour the commitments unless and until it decided otherwise \u2013 a disclosure which would have deprived the commitments of all value as investment incentives. The sole remaining alternative is the third one. Therefore, a reasonable investor would have had reason to conclude that the state, presumed to act in good faith, intended to honour its commitments according to their terms, and to refrain from exercising its power to revoke them.99\n\nc. Third, if objectively reasonable expectations could not have arisen from the commitments made in RD 661/2007 because the state had the general power to amend or repeal that decree, the same reasoning would apply to the (less specific) commitments made in Law 54/1997, because that law could have been (and in fact was) later repealed. In this sense, the logic of the revocability argument extends beyond RD 661/2007, to all norms of the Spanish legal system that are subject to amendment or repeal. It is therefore inconsistent for the Majority and the Respondent to embrace the revocability argument while accepting that the Claimant could derive \"legitimate\" expectations from the reference to \"reasonable rates of return\" in Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997.100\n\nd. Fourth, the theory that no objectively reasonable expectations can be based on revocable commitments contradicts common sense and the way in which real-world investors make long-term investment decisions. It follows from that theory that a \"reasonable\" investor would have to *assume* that the state *would* exercise its power to repudiate its commitments, notwithstanding grounds to believe that the state sincerely intended to honour those commitments. In other words, according to that theory, a \"reasonable\" investor must assume that any state commitment that is subject to change cannot be trusted and should be ignored. In the real world, however, governments offer incentives to investors for the intended purpose of being relied upon, and reasonable investors do not make decisions by automatically assuming that outcomes will always be the worst. (Otherwise, fewer investments would be made.) In particular, if real-world investors had to assume that state commitments such as those made in RD 661/2007 should be ignored, those commitments would never be able to achieve their intended purpose of providing incentives to long-term investors. An incentive on which no investor can rely is not an incentive.\n\nSee **RL-0090**, *Cube*, \u00b6 305 (\"[A]fter careful reflection, being perfectly aware of the jurisprudence of their Supreme Court, the Spanish authorities decided that the Special Regime for the remuneration of renewable energy should be established for a long duration in order to attract sufficient investment that otherwise could not have been obtained. This was a deliberate decision from which the Respondent cannot move away lightly.\").\n\nDecision, \u00b6 355; *Id.*, \u00b6 301 (summarizing the Respondent\u2019s position).\n\n91.\n\nIt follows from the preceding discussion that, as a matter of application of the standards of the ECT, the revocability of a legal regime does not prevent that regime from giving rise to objectively reasonable expectations. It remains to determine whether the Claimant\u2019s expectations to the stability of the amended Fourth Regime, including the commitments set forth in RD 661/2007, were in fact objectively reasonable. As on all matters concerning the standard of reasonableness, the answer depends on all the relevant circumstances.\n\n92.\n\nAs already discussed, a reasonable investor had good reasons to believe that the Respondent *intended* to honour its commitments according with their terms.101 Further, those commitments were made against the background of a consistent, long-standing state policy aimed at increasing the production of electricity from renewable sources, a policy consistent with EU directives and other international commitments of the host state.102 That policy had been implemented through a succession of legal regimes which generally maintained or increased the incentives provided to producers of energy from wind.103 Those successive regimes generally gave existing investors the choice of staying under the old regime or opting into the new one.104 One important exception was RD 661/2007, which was generally imposed on existing producers, but in that case grandfathering the existing remuneration regime would have perpetuated a design flaw, which was not a matter of policy but the perverse operation of an ill-chosen adjustment formula.105 Further, the Claimant\u2019s expectations were not that the Fourth Regime, as amended, would be immutable, but that it would be stable. In light of these circumstances, it must be concluded that the Claimant\u2019s expectations based the Fourth Regime, including the overall stability of the regime, were objectively reasonable.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 90.\n\nSee generally, Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 97-119.\n\nSee *Id.*; see **CE-1**, Brattle First Regulatory Report, \u00b6\u00b6 99-110.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 85.\n\nUnder the Third Regime, tariffs were adjusted by reference to the *Tarifa Media o de Referencia*, an index of the cost of electricity for final consumers in Spain. It turned out that this index was unsuitable because an increase in the generation of electricity from renewable sources would have led to higher premiums, which would have led to an increase in the index, which would have led to higher premiums, etc. See Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 473. RDL 7/2006 (**BRR-101**) suspended operation of the index and RD 661/2007 replaced it. **C-0008** or **R-0101**, RD 661/2007, Second Transitory Provision.\n\n**iii. Circumstances Related to the Disputed Measures**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe relevant circumstances related to the Disputed Measures concern the character of the measures and the effects they had on the preceding legal regime and the Claimant\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations based thereon. As already discussed, the commitment under the second sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT to accord fair and equitable treatment is textually and contextually linked to the conditions referred to in the first sentence of the same provision.106 Accordingly, an analysis of the relevant circumstances related to the Disputed Measures should include: (i) the degree to which the measures were favourable and transparent; (ii) the extent to which they affected the preceding legal regime and the degree to which the resulting treatment conditions can be considered stable; and (iii) the extent to which they repudiated specific commitments or frustrated the Claimant\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations based on the preceding regime.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 24.\n\n94.\n\nAs already explained, I perceive no legal basis for applying the *Blusun* rule, either as purported interpretation of the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard of Article 10(1) of the ECT or as a substitute therefor.107 Nevertheless, as part of the discussion in this subsection I shall critically examine the three conditions, factors, or criteria which would come into play under the *Blusun* rule in the assumed absence of a special commitment: (i) whether it became \"necessary\" to modify the subsidies granted by the preceding regime; (ii) whether the modification was done in a manner \"not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment\"; and (iii) whether the modification was made with \"due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.\"108\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 32.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 28.\n\n***Favourability***\n-------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Disputed Measures were undoubtedly less favourable to the producers of electricity from wind than was the preceding legal regime. The Claimant argues that the Respondent failed to provide favourable conditions for the investment.109 The question is, however, whether the concept of favourability referred to in the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT (and relevant also to the second sentence) applies to treatment consisting of granting and modifying subsidies. Subsidies are indeed favourable to the recipient, but they differ fundamentally from the ordinary conditions that states create for investments; they are extraordinary, ultra-favourable benefits which states grant in exceptional circumstances to sustain or promote particular economic activities. No provision of the ECT requires states to grant such extraordinary benefits. In particular, no such obligation appears in Article 19(1)(d) of the ECT, which merely requires Contracting Parties to \"have particular regard [\u2026] to developing and using renewable energy sources.\"110\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 206-212 and the immediately following heading.\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 19(1)(d).\n\n96.\n\nIn light of this context and the extraordinary nature of subsidies, the term \"favourable conditions\" in Article 10(1) should be interpreted as referring to ordinary conditions for an investment, not including subsidies. For these reasons, the Claimant\u2019s argument on favourability should be rejected. Article 10(1) of the ECT did not require the Respondent to grant subsidies to the eolic-energy sector and, if it chose to grant such subsidies, a requirement that they be maintained cannot be derived from the favourability factor of Article 10(1).111\n\nThis conclusion refers exclusively to the favourability factor in the circumstances of this case and has no bearing on the other elements of the fair-and-equitable-treatment analysis. The Majority reaches a similar result, without discussing the favourability factor. See Decision, \u00b6 317.\n\n***Transparency***\n------------------\n\n97.\n\nIf the Disputed Measures are taken at face value, their prescriptive content and effects on the preceding regime are reasonable clear. But the Respondent\u2019s arguments in defence of those measures give rise to serious transparency issues, as shown by the preceding discussion and the one yet to come. For example, if it were true that the producers were entitled only to the \"reasonable rates of return\" referred to in Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 and nothing more (a position that the Majority accepts), the entire regime would have been non-transparent, because it would have failed to explain (i) what rates of return the state considered reasonable or (ii) on what \"cost of money in the capital markets\" they were based or (iii) how future tariffs would reflect changes in (i) or (ii). Further, the Disputed Measures fail to explain why rates of return once considered reasonable are no longer so considered or what changes in the cost of money in the capital markets led the state to that conclusion. These transparency issues become less important if one rejects the false premise that the producer could have no rights or expectations other than those arising out of the reference to \"reasonable rates of return\" in Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997.112\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 90.\n\n***Stability***\n---------------\n\n98.\n\nAs already discussed, the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT requires that the state create \"stable conditions\" for the making of investments. In addition, for textual and contextual reasons the stability of the existing conditions is a relevant factor to be considered in the application of the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard. As noted, stability is not the same as immutability. The stability of a legal regime is consistent with changes that do not exceed a certain magnitude \u2013 a magnitude which is usually explained in terms of the importance or centrality of the changed elements and the effects and timing of the changes.113 Accordingly, we must review the extent of the changes that the Disputed Measures introduced in the preceding regime and then assess the magnitude of those changes and the resulting impact on the stability of that regime.\n\nFor examples of different ways of describing the magnitude of a change that deprives the changed regime of stability see, *e.g.*, **RL-0093**, *OperaFund*, \u00b6 508 (essential characteristics of the regulatory regime relied upon by investors); **CL-0116**, *Foresight Luxembourg Solar 1 S.\u00e0 r.l. and others [Greentech] v. Kingdom of Spain* (SCC Arbitration V (2015/150)), Final Award, 14 November 2018, \u00b6 365 (fundamental and abrupt alteration), \u00b6\u00b6 397-398 (radical and unexpected, fundamental change); **CL-0112**, *Novenergia II*, \u00b6 695 (radical and unexpected); **CL-0079** or **RL-0071**, *Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energ\u00eda Solar Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36), Award, 4 May 2017, \u00b6 382 (radical alteration that deprives investors who invested in reliance of the regime of the value of their investments), \u00b6 387 (drastic and abrupt revision of the regime on which the investment depended in a way that destroyed its value); **CL-0039** or **RL-0050**, *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01), Decision on Liability, 27 December 2010, \u00b6 168\u00a0(no respect for certain basic features of the amended regime); **CL-0023**, *Micula*, \u00b6 687 (formal shell of regime maintained but eviscerated of all or substantially all of its content); Hob\u00e9r Dissent, \u00b6 9 (fundamental and radical changes).\n\n99.\n\nThe Disputed Measures introduced the following principal changes in the preceding legal regime:\n\na. *Change in the Rate of Return Deemed Reasonable*. While the rate of return implicit in the earlier regime was not disclosed, the evidence shows it was in the order of 7% after taxes or 9.382% before taxes. For the first six years, the Disputed Measures adopted as reasonable a rate of return of 7.398% before taxes, which translates to about 5.179% after taxes. This rate was based on the average yield of 10-year Treasury bonds in the secondary market over the preceding ten years, plus 300 basis points.\n\nb. *Change in the Remuneration Regime*. The Disputed Measures completely replaced the previous remuneration regime. The old premiums and regulated feed-in tariffs were replaced by a \"specific remuneration\" consisting of two components, one based on installed capacity (the \u2018investment incentive\") and another based on production (the \"operating incentive\"). The operating incentive is not available for wind farms. The investment incentive is calculated as a 7.398% pre-tax return based on the estimated investment costs of a standard installation.\n\nc. *Change in the Effects of Production on the Remuneration.* The specific remuneration depends on attaining a number of annual operating hours assigned to a particular type of installation to which each installation is in turn assigned. The financial support varies between an operating threshold and a minimum number of operating hours and, once that minimum number is attained, it does not increase with any increased production.\n\nd. *A New Claw-Back Feature*. The Disputed Measures provide that if under the previous regimes a plant earned a rate of return higher than the one now deemed reasonable (7.398% before taxes), the cumulative return in excess of the new target rate would be set off against the financial incentives to which the plant would be entitled under the new regime. The effect of this change is to claw-back the benefit of the efficiencies achieved by the producer under the old regime and effectively to cap the producer\u2019s actual rate of return at the level the regulator now deems reasonable.\n\ne. *Change in the Relevant Life of a Plant.* The remuneration provided under the preceding regime applied to the entire useful life of a facility. The Disputed Measures provide that the specific remuneration would apply only to the \"regulatory life\" of the facility, which it sets at 20 years.114\n\n**C-0018**, MO IET/1045/2014 of 16 June 2014, Art. 5.\n\n100.\n\nThe changes just described affected critical aspects of the preceding legal regime. The Claimant\u2019s expert on regulation characterized them as a \"mid-stream switch in the regulatory paradigm\" for existing plants.115 The preceding regime followed a paradigm based on a generally stable subsidized remuneration per MWh produced, which gave producers an incentive to build and manage projects efficiently, in the hope of achieving better financial results than those made possible by the subsidized remuneration, in exchange for taking the risk of selecting the sites, designs, and equipment. In contrast, the Disputed Measures adopted a paradigm based on imputed (not actual) costs (even for plants already built under the old regime) and a designated pre-tax target rate of return based on such imputed costs, a rate of return which operated as a ceiling on the producer\u2019s actual financial results. This change of paradigm has had the effect of depriving efficient producers of the rewards that they accrued under the previous system in exchange for the risks taken. The point here is not whether one paradigm is better than the other or the switch in mid-stream was economically efficient or inefficient. The point is the magnitude of the change, and the change was indeed radical. Consequently, the stability of the preceding legal regime was severely impaired.\n\n**CE-1**, Brattle\u2019s First Regulatory Report, \u00b6\u00b6 154-183.\n\n***Abrogation of Specific Commitments and Frustration of Objectively Reasonable Expectations***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nAs discussed, RD 661/2007 set forth certain specific commitments regarding the remuneration regime for producers of electricity from wind and the duration of that regime.116 By repealing and replacing the entire regime, the Disputed Measures abrogated those commitments.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 77.\n\n102.\n\nI have also concluded that the Claimant derived objectively reasonable expectations to the stability of the Fourth Regime, as amended.117 By radically impairing the stability of the preceding regime, the Disputed Measures frustrated those expectations.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 87.\n\n***The*** **Blusun** ***Criteria***\n-----------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe *Blusun* rule sets forth three criteria that the state must satisfy to modify subsidies previously granted, in the absence of a specific commitment to keep them unmodified: (i) the modification must have become necessary; (ii) it must not be disproportionate to the aim pursued; and (iii) it should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.118\n\n**CL-0083** or **RL-0074**, *Blusun*, \u00b6 319(5); Decision, \u00b6 335.\n\n104.\n\nThe first criterion is *necessity* (\"if it becomes necessary to modify them\"). The Majority does not discuss it in detail, but it plainly concludes that the modification of the existing subsidies regime had become necessary to address the tariff deficit.119\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 337-338.\n\n105.\n\nTwo observations must be made regarding the criterion of necessity. The first is that the \"necessity\" at issue here is not a plea of necessity under customary international law, as codified in Article 25 of the ILC\u2019s Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, and therefore the requirements of the latter are not applicable.120 The second observation is that in applying this criterion, the Majority does not use \"necessary\" in a strict sense. Strictly speaking, to say that modifying the Fourth Regime was *necessary* to \"address\" the tariff deficit is to say that the modification was a *necessary condition* (*conditio sine qua non*) for achieving that result or, in other words, that no other measures would have solved or ameliorated the problem. This is certainly not the way in which the Majority applies this criterion. Not only does the Majority fail to show that the tariff deficit could not have been addressed without modifying the Fourth Regime \u2013 it expressly declines to consider alternative measures.121 It appears, then, that in the Majority\u2019s view, the relation between the problem (the tariff deficit) and the means to address it (the modification of the subsidies) is not a matter subject to the Tribunal\u2019s review.\n\n**CL-0057**, Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, Article 25.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 338 (\"[I]t is not for the Tribunal to second guess reasonable measures taken to address the deficit (including measures affecting existing plants), to propose alternative policies that could have been adopted, or to weigh up for itself the competing demands of generators and consumers.\")\n\n106.\n\nIn this light, it appears that \"if it becomes necessary to modify the subsidies\" in fact means \"if the state considers, in its discretion, desirable to modify the subsidies.\" This means that the \"necessity\" criterion (as the Majority applies it) has no limiting function, and hence it can have no meaningful role in the evaluation of a measure under the *Blusun* rule.\n\n107.\n\nThe second criterion in the *Blusun* rule is \"proportionality to the aim of the legislative enactment.\"122 In this case, the Disputed Measures are the \"legislative enactment\" and the aim of the Disputed Measures is to \"address\" (presumably, to eliminate or reduce) the tariff deficit.123 Accordingly, to satisfy this criterion the Disputed Measures must have been proportionate to the aim of eliminating or reducing the tariff deficit. Yet, it is not entirely clear what the *Blusun* rule and the Majority understand by \"proportionality.\" It appears that, as a starting point, the measure must be *suitable* to achieve the aim, but it is not self-evident at what point a suitable measure should be considered disproportionate to the aim. The way the Majority applies this criterion suggests that a suitable measure is disproportionate to the extent it is not necessary (perhaps *stricto sensu*) to achieve the aim, even if the absence of the measure should delay achievement of the aim.124\n\n**CL-0083** or **RL-0074**, *Blusun*, \u00b6 319(5); Decision, \u00b6 335 (\"[The modification of the existing subsidies] should be done in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment\").\n\nDecision, \u00b6 338.\n\nIn the Majority\u2019s analysis, all aspects of the Disputed Measures meet the criterion of proportionality, except for the claw-back feature. The claw-back feature is excluded because it \"has not been shown to have been necessary to resolve the tariff deficit problem, which would have been solved in any event by the Disputed Measures without much further delay and without the element of claw-back.\" Decision, \u00b6 355. It is not clear, however, why the same reasoning should not apply to the shortening of the relevant life of a plant, which the Majority regards as satisfying the criterion of proportionality.\n\n108.\n\nThe idea of proportionality often plays a role in the application of the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard, either as a separate *considerandum* (or element of the standard) or as part of the reasoning through which the various elements are assessed and weighed.125 In any case, the Majority\u2019s version of proportionality cannot *meaningfully* serve as an element in the fair-and-equitable-treatment analysis, much less as an overall control factor. Let us examine the characteristics of this criterion more closely. First, the aim of the measure is deemed to be unreviewable. Second, the *Blusun* proportionality relation is primarily an instrumental one \u2013 that of means to an end. Only to the extent that the means somehow overshoot the end are they considered disproportionate. Conceivably, a system of review of state measures focused on ends and means can combine either a strong or weak review of means with either a strong or weak review of ends. The proportionality criterion of the *Blusun* rule combines a weak review of means with no review of ends. The result is a very weak criterion, which puts no meaningful limits on the state\u2019s power to modify subsidies. More important, it is not apparent whether this weak version of proportionality bears any relationship to the ordinary meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment.\" I shall presently return to the way the Majority applies this criterion.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, **RL-0093**, *OperaFund*, \u00b6 555 (part of a balancing assessment).\n\n109.\n\nThe third *Blusun* criterion is \"due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients [of the subsidies] who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.\"126 The Majority does not explain what this criterion means, nor does the Majority appear to apply it independently of the proportionality criterion. The most obvious difficulty is the uncertain meaning of \"due regard.\" This expression, common in diplomatic language and \"soft\" legal texts, normally refers to something that ought to happen in the process of taking a decision, not to the result of that process.127 This criterion appears to mean, then, that in modifying the subsidies the state ought to *consider* (or consider carefully) the reasonable reliance interests of the recipients of the subsidies.128 If this is so, then this third criterion can serve as an exhortation to the state about how it should act in the process of devising changes to the subsidies but not so much as a basis for a tribunal to review the objective results of that process.129 By contrast, the standard of Article 10(1), second sentence, concerns the fairness and equity of the actual *treatment* received by an investor, not (or not only) the fairness and equity of the process through which the state devised such treatment. Therefore, the third *Blusun* criterion is not really useful as a basis on which a tribunal can determine whether a particular measure constitutes fair and equitable treatment.\n\n**CL-0083** or **RL-0074**, *Blusun*, \u00b6 319(5); Decision, \u00b6 335.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, Art. 19(1)(d) of the ECT (requiring Contracting Parties to \"have particular regard [\u2026] to developing and using renewable energy sources\").\n\nIt is also unclear whose reliance interests the state ought to consider. Depending on whether the relative sentence beginning with \"who may have committed\" is read as a qualification or an explanation, the class of the relevant recipients may or may not be restricted to those who committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.\n\nA state may carefully consider the reasonable reliance interests of the recipients of subsidies and yet decide that those interests are outweighed by other interests. If such a decision were unreviewable (as a matter of application of the *Blusun* rule or for sheer practical reasons), this would be another criterion that places no meaningful limits on the state\u2019s discretion.\n\n110.\n\nThe Majority applies the *Blusun* rule in a piecemeal manner, to various components of the Disputed Measures,130 an approach which implicitly discards assessing the overall stability of the regime. In so doing, the Majority finds fault with only two aspects of the Disputed Measures: (i) the claw-back feature and (ii) the shortened \"regulatory\" life assigned to the existing installations. The Majority adjudges the claw-back feature to be inconsistent with the principle of stability and to fail the *Blusun* criterion of proportionality.131 As for the life assigned to the existing installations, the Majority considers it to be unreasonable, but this presumptive violation is in the end erased after applying an overall control of proportionality.132\n\nDecision, \u00b6 339.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 355.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 340-344.\n\n111.\n\nNevertheless, when it comes to applying the overall control of proportionality to all aspects of the Disputed Measures other than the claw-back feature, the Majority sets aside the (conceptual) proportionality criterion of the *Blusun* rule and adopts instead a quantitative test, based on the approach used in another case to quantify damages.133 The Majority\u2019s quantitative-proportionality test is based on its view of the Claimant\u2019s \"legitimate\" expectations to an *actual* rate of return. The Majority\u2019s reasoning is as follows: (i) \"the only legitimate expectation the Claimant could have had was that of a \u2018reasonable return\u2019 in terms of the 1997 Law;\"134 (ii) the \"reasonable return\" is a dynamic concept;135 (iii) the Disputed Measures set a target return of 7.398%; (iv) the Claimant\u2019s overall projected rate of return after the Disputed Measures is 13.8% (average of the experts\u2019 calculations); and (v) this rate of return is \"well above the 7.398% target of the Spanish regulator.\"136 On this basis, the Majority concludes that the Respondent did not breach its obligation to ensure a reasonable return and did not frustrate the Claimant\u2019s \"legitimate\" expectation to obtain such a return.137\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 357-358, relying on **RL-0088**, *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two lux S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30), Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, \u00b6 523.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 356.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 366.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 367-368.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 369.\n\n112.\n\nAs already discussed, the premise on which this whole approach is based is faulty. Law 54/1997 did not give producers a right to an *actual* rate of return (reasonable or unreasonable, floor or ceiling); it just set forth a conceptual target (reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital markets) for the Government to aim at in setting the premiums.138 A producer\u2019s actual rates of return could be higher or lower depending *inter alia* on the efficiency of its choices. For the same reason, the Claimant did not have a \"legitimate\" expectation to realizing any particular *actual* rate of return; its objectively reasonable expectation was merely to receive the premiums calculated on the basis of the Fourth Regime in the manner and for the period designated, subject to an overall expectation to the stability of that regime. Apart from being based on a false premise, the Majority\u2019s quantitative-proportionality calculation is also flawed in its economic effect: it counts against the Claimant the value of the efficiencies it realized under the abolished regime.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 65, 111.\n\n113.\n\nI conclude that if the *Blusun* criteria were intended, as surrogates for the requirement of fair and equitable treatment, to place some limits on the state\u2019s power to modify subsidies, they do not do that well or even meaningfully. I agree, though, that there is room for a meaningful criterion of proportionality in a fair-and-equitable treatment analysis. The key issue is, after all, whether it is fair and equitable for the investor or a class of investors to bear all or most of the cost of a policy change which the state deems desirable.139 In this respect, a criterion of proportionality that compares the burden placed on the investors with the burden placed (or which could have been placed) on an appropriate comparator group, or the population at large, would be more closely related to the ordinary meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment.\" The record contains no such comparison, but it does contain a related, indirect exercise. The Claimant\u2019s regulatory expert compared five alternative ways of dealing with the tariff deficit and concluded that the Respondent relied *disproportionately* on the Disputed Measures, which means that those measures were not a proportionate solution.140\n\nSee **CL-0117**, *9REN Holding S.a\u0300.r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/15), Award of 31 May 2019, \u00b6 243 (\"The question before the Tribunal however is whether such changes [changes of Spanish regulatory measures made in the exercise of Spanish sovereignty] can be made by Spain **without financial consequences** under the ECT.\") (emphasis in the original).\n\n**CE-1**, Brattle, Changes to the Regulation of Wind Installations in Spain since December 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 132-149, esp. \u00b6 149. (\"The reasons behind Spain\u2019s failure to implement alternative solutions to the Tariff Deficit, including the CO2 tax and fuel tax and the profiling of FITs for renewable installations recommended by the EC or the CNE, remain unclear. The failure to exhaust other alternatives demonstrates that Spain relied *disproportionately* on the Disputed Measures \u2013 in other words they were not a proportionate solution.\") (emphasis in the original).\n\n**c. Conclusions**\n------------------\n\n114.\n\nIn the preceding subsections I have analysed the circumstances of the present case that appear relevant to assess the claim for breach of the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard. Those circumstances include specific commitments made in the legal regime that the Disputed Measures replaced, the Claimant\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations, the degree of favourability and transparency of the Disputed Measures, and the effects of those measures on the stability of the antecedent regime, the specific commitments, and the Claimant\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. I have also critically examined the criteria set forth in the *Blusun* rule. Partial conclusions have been drawn at each step of the analysis. It remains to reach a general conclusion.\n\n115.\n\nIf the Disputed Measures are considered in the light of all the circumstances analysed in the preceding subsections, it must be concluded that the treatment provided by those measures did not accord with the ordinary meaning of \"fair and equitable.\" Consequently, by imposing the Disputed Measures the Respondent breached its obligation under the second sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT. Separately, for the same reasons set forth in respect of the analysis of the stability factor, the Respondent breached its obligation under the first sentence of Article 10(1) to create stable conditions for the Claimant\u2019s investments made under the Fourth Regime.\n\n**C. CLAIMS GROUNDED ON ARTICLE 10(1), THIRD SENTENCE, OF THE ECT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Disputed Measures violated a portion of the third sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT concerning unreasonable or discriminatory measures.141 The Respondent rejects that claim.142 The Majority takes the view that \"unreasonable or discriminatory measures in the general sense are examples of measures that breach the FET standard as contained in Article 10(1), first and second sentences.\"143 Then it finds that \"[n]o conclusive evidence was provided to necessitate a finding of unreasonableness or discrimination under those elements of the FET standard, save insofar as the retro-active aspect of the Disputed Measures, in the form of the claw-back clause is concerned.\"144 On this basis, the Majority declines to make a separate finding of unreasonableness or discrimination, even in respect of the claw-back feature.145 In the end, this claim is rejected in the *dispositif.*146\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 371-377.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 378-383.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 387.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 388.\n\n*Id.*\n\nDecision, \u00b6 467(d), (e).\n\n117.\n\nThe third sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT provides that\n\n\"no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their [Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.\"147\n\n**C-0001**, ECT, Art. 10(1), third sentence.\n\n118.\n\nI cannot agree with the view that the quoted portion of the third sentence is somehow subsumed within the standard of fair and equitable treatment under the second sentence. Legal provisions that purport to state separate rules should be applied separately, even if upon analysis their prescriptive contents partially overlap. In this respect, it cannot be assumed, without the benefit of analysis, that the prescriptive content of the quoted portion of the third sentence is a subset of the prescriptive content of the second sentence, or vice versa.\n\n119.\n\nIf the Majority had upheld the claims under the first and second sentences of Article 10(1) in full, it might have been justifiable to decline to address the claim under the third sentence, on the ground that the quantum of compensation would not have changed. But since the Majority rejects almost all aspects of the claims under the first and second sentences, it would have been appropriate for the Tribunal to analyse the prescriptive content of the third sentence and to resolve the claim thereunder. I cannot perceive any justification for the Majority\u2019s blanket dismissal of this claim.\n\n120.\n\nFor the purposes of this Partial Dissent, it is unnecessary to embark on a comparative analysis of the standard of fair and equitable treatment and that of unreasonable and discriminatory measures. But even without getting into details, one conclusion can be drawn from the preceding discussion. If the Disputed Measures breached the obligation of stability under the first sentence of Article 10(1) and the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment under the second sentence, as I have concluded earlier, *a fortiori* they should be considered to have breached the obligation not to impair, by unreasonable measures, the use and enjoyment of the Claimant\u2019s investments.\n\n**D. ON EU STATE AID**\n----------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent has raised two defences grounded on the EU legal regime on state aid. The first defence is that the Claimant did not have, and could not have had, any \"legitimate\" expectation to receiving any Special Regime subsidies.148 The second is that any Award rendered in this case ordering the Respondent to make payments in excess of those provided by the Disputed Measures would itself constitute impermissible state aid and would be subject to a stand-still obligation under EU law.149\n\nDecision, \u00b6 391. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to distinguish the various versions of the regime preceding the Disputed Measures. I shall therefore adopt the Majority\u2019s terminology and refer to it as the Special Regime.\n\n*Id.*\n\n122.\n\nWith regard to the second defence, I agree with my colleagues that the Tribunal is bound to decide the present case in accordance with the applicable law.150 The enforceability of the Award is a separate matter, to be addressed in a separate proceeding, outside this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.151 The EC\u2019s threat to block enforcement of the Award cannot deter the Tribunal from fulfilling its function.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 427.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 422, quoting from *Vattenfall AB and others v. Federal Republic of Germany* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12), Decision on the *Achmea* Issue, 31 August 2018, \u00b6 230; Decision, \u00b6 427.\n\n123.\n\nOn the contrary, I disagree with the Majority\u2019s analysis and disposition of the first EU-state-aid defence. The Majority states its conclusion as follows:\n\n\"In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds[,] by majority[,] that under EU law and the law of Spain, the Claimant could not legitimately have expected that the Special Regime subsidies were, for certain, lawful. Even if the subsidies were lawful, it could not expect, under EU law and the law of Spain, that the amount of state aid granted under these measures would be paid for the lifetime of the plants. The Claimant should have known that these measures had not been notified to, let alone approved by, the EC.\"152\n\nDecision, \u00b6 428. It is not clear what the majority means by saying that *even if the subsidies were lawful*, the Claimant could not have \"legitimately\" expected, under EU and Spanish law, that the subsidies would be paid for the lifetime of the plants. Perhaps the Majority is referring to its own prior analysis based on Spanish law, in which it concluded that the regime did not give rise to any such expectation. But then, why the reference to EU law? Or perhaps the Majority is referring to the Claimant\u2019s expectation preceding a subsequent EC decision to approve the subsidies (as in the case of the Disputed Measures), a decision which would erase the illegality. Or perhaps the Majority is alluding to something else. These uncertainties need not be resolved because the Majority takes the view, as discussed further in the text, that the subsidies regime was unlawful under EU law.\n\n124.\n\nThe reasoning supporting these conclusions appears to consist of the following key steps: (i) under EU law, the Respondent had an obligation to notify state aid to the EC;153 (ii) state aid which is not notified to the EC, or which is implemented before it is authorized by the EC, is unlawful;154 (iii) in a case of unnotified state aid, the EC has the power to recover such aid from recipients or, alternatively, to approve such aid if it finds it compatible with the internal market;155 (iv) the Special Regime constituted state aid and hence should have been notified to the EC;156 (v) the Respondent should have been aware of its notification duty and should have acted accordingly;157 (vi) it is undisputed that the Respondent made no such notification;158 (vii) ergo, the Special Regime was unlawful under EU and Spanish law;159 (viii) the Claimant should have known that the Special Regime had not been notified to the EC;160 (ix) ergo, the Claimant could not have had the \"legitimate\" expectation that the subsidies granted by the Special Regime were, for certain, lawful;161 and (x) therefore, the Claimant could not have derived any \"legitimate\" expectations from that regime.162\n\nDecision, \u00b6 410.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 411.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 411.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 419.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 426.\n\nThe Majority acknowledges that the EC (i) was well informed of the Special Regime and even praised it; (ii) took a \"rather generous\" approach to such schemes; and (iii) took no enforcement action while that regime was in force or afterwards. Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 415-417, 425, 427. Yet these facts play no role in the Majority\u2019s reasoning leading to the conclusion quoted in the preceding paragraph. The absence of enforcement action does play a role in the Majority\u2019s discussion of the claw-back feature in the context of EU state-aid law, as discussed later in the text.\n\nThis conclusion is not explicit in the Majority\u2019s argument, but it follows necessarily from the preceding steps. In addition, the Majority notes that the EC took the view that the Disputed Measures \"were state aid and, not having been notified, were unlawful,\" in spite of which the EC approved them as compatible with the internal market. Decision, \u00b6 421, citing **RL-0073**, EC decision of 10 November 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 84-89. The Majority relies on this EC Decision to conclude \"by parity of reasoning\" that the Special regime constituted state aid. Parity of reasoning would also lead the Majority to conclude that the Special Regime, not having been notified, was unlawful under EU law. Decision, \u00b6 419.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 428.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 428.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 423(a) (\"In principle, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation of treatment which is unlawful under the law of the host state, provided that the host state law itself is not acting inconsistently with the treaty under which the tribunal exercises its jurisdiction.\"). This statement may be acceptable in principle, but only in principle. It cannot be used as a technical rule to foreclose consideration of other circumstances bearing on the objective reasonableness of the expectation. See **CL-0016**, *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3), Award on the Merits, 20 May 1992 (henceforth, *SPP v. Egypt*), \u00b6\u00b6 82, 83 (\"These acts, which are now alleged to have been in violation of the Egyptian municipal legal system, created expectations protected by established principles of international law. A determination that these acts are null and void under municipal law would not resolve the ultimate question of liability for damages suffered by the victim who relied on the acts.\").\n\n125.\n\nThis reasoning, if I understand it correctly, has two important implications. The first is that the Majority\u2019s EU state-aid analysis largely obviates its own analysis under the *Blusun* rule. As already discussed, the Majority concludes, incorrectly in my view, that the Claimant could have derived no \"legitimate\" expectations from the regime of RD 661/2007. That conclusion was based on the notion that the \"stream\" (RD 661/2007) cannot rise higher than its \"source\" (Law 54/1997), but the same conclusion now flows from the Majority\u2019s EU state-aid analysis. Up to that point, both analyses of the Majority lead to the same result, but the same is not true in respect of Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997, which the Majority regards as the source (the sole source) of a \"legitimate\" expectation to a reasonable rate of return, which in turn becomes the benchmark for the Majority\u2019s notion of proportionality. If Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 is part of a subsidies regime which was not notified to the EC and hence was unlawful under EU and Spanish law, it is difficult to see how (under the Majority\u2019s reasoning) Article 30.4 could be the source of an expectation of a reasonable return or how such expectation could serve as a measure of proportionality.\n\n126.\n\nA second implication flows from the Majority\u2019s discussion of the claw-back feature in the context of the unnotified subsidies regime. The Majority dismisses the Respondent\u2019s state-aid defence on the ground that \"the subsidies having been paid (*and subject to any lawful recovery measures by the EC, which did not occur*), they remained entitled to the benefit of the stable regime which Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT promised.\"163 This statement underscores the fragility of the basis on which the Majority finds a breach of Article 10(1), first and second sentences, in respect of the claw-back feature. That finding is now \"subject to any lawful recovery measures by the EC.\" No such recovery has occurred to date, but it may still occur (if EU law so authorizes), or at any rate it might have occurred. Therefore, in the Majority\u2019s view the Respondent\u2019s breach of the ECT in respect of the claw-back feature depends on the contingent fact that the EC has not exercised its enforcement powers under EU law.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 430 (emphasis added).\n\n127.\n\nThe Majority\u2019s line of reasoning on EU state aid and its conclusions and implications are, in my view, incorrect. First, it is not correct to regard EU law as part of the law to be applied in this case, and to apply it as such, even though the EU Treaties, as *res inter alios acta*, are not binding in the relations between the Respondent and Japan. The Majority indeed applies EU law as law, notably by adopting as a major premise that unnotified state aid is unlawful,164 by holding (by parity of reasoning from the EC\u2019s Decision of 10 November 2017) that the Special Regime constituted state aid,165 and by concluding that, because the Respondent failed to notify the Special Regime, that regime was unlawful under EU and Spanish law.166 This last conclusion is, in turn, the major premise for the findings that the Claimant could have had no \"legitimate\" expectation to the lawfulness of the Special Regime and that the stability of that regime was subject to the EC\u2019s power to recover the subsidies paid under that regime.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 411.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 419.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 421.\n\n128.\n\nSecond, it is incorrect to accept the possibility that EU law, as applicable law, might trump a legal conclusion based on the ECT. If the EC\u2019s exercise of its powers under EU law could have foreclosed a ruling from the Tribunal that the stability obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT was breached, the source of such powers (EU law) would have trumped the ECT. This conclusion cannot be reconciled with the primacy of the ECT under its Article 26(6) or even with the Majority\u2019s own view that, through the \"indirect relevance\" of Article 16 of the ECT, an ECT rule that is more favourable to the investor would prevail over a conflicting rule of EU law.167 Apart from this role as a trump card, EU law on state aid works as an overriding consideration in the fair-and-equitable-treatment analysis, superseding other considerations required by such analysis. This whole approach is inconsistent, in my view, with the system of norms which the Tribunal is bound to apply under Article 26(6) of the ECT.\n\nSee discussion *supra*, \u00b6 9.\n\n129.\n\nOn the contrary, from the standpoint of international law, which is the Tribunal\u2019s standpoint, the laws of Spain (which happen to incorporate EU state-aid rules) are merely facts, except to the extent that the ECT effects a *renvoi* to them expressly or by clear implication.168 As already explained, EU law, based on treaties which are *res inter alios acta*, plays a similar role. Therefore, both Spanish law and EU law contribute to the *factual* matrix in respect of which the provisions of the ECT must be applied. But the legal status of the Special Regime under EU law is not the sole factual element to be considered in applying Article 10(1) of the ECT. All the circumstances related to such legal status must be considered, including in particular the Respondent\u2019s failure to notify the regime to the EC and the context in which that failure took place.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 423(b).\n\n130.\n\nLet us then examine the influence of these EU state-aid considerations on the Claimant\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. As we have seen, the Majority takes the view that \"the Claimant could not legitimately have expected that the Special Regime subsidies were, *for certain*, lawful,\"169 and such a lack of certainty would prevent any \"legitimate\" expectation of treatment according to that regime.170 This requirement of certainty of lawfulness appears to be based on a series of decisions of the CJEU.171 Yet, whatever may be said about such a certainty requirement as a condition for \"legitimate expectations\" to arise *under EU law*, CJEU precedents have no bearing on the conditions for \"legitimate expectations\" (or objectively reasonable expectations) *under the ECT*.172\n\nDecision, \u00b6 428 (emphasis added).\n\nDecision, \u00b6 423(a).\n\nSee Decision, \u00b6 412, quoting from Case C-199/06, *Centre d\u2019exportation du livre fran\u00e7ais v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 internationale de diffusion et d\u2019\u00e9dition*, 12 February 2008 (GC), \u00b6 67, citing Case C-91/01 *Italy v. Commission* [2004] ECR I-4355, \u00b6 66 (\"[S]o long as the Commission has not taken a decision approving aid, and so long as the period for bringing an action against such a decision has not expired, the recipient *cannot be sure* as to the lawfulness of the proposed aid which alone is capable of giving rise to a legitimate expectation on his part.\") (emphasis added).\n\nThe Majority admits as much in respect of EC\u2019s pronouncements (\"[\u2026] so does the EC not have jurisdiction to impose a binding interpretation of the meaning of legitimate expectations *under the ECT*.\"). Decision, \u00b6 432 (emphasis in the original).\n\n131.\n\nAs a matter of application of the ECT, it cannot be right to require that the Claimant have expected, \"for certain,\" that the Special Regime was lawful. The Special Regime, like any other Spanish laws and royal decrees, bore a presumption of legality, and the Claimant was entitled to rely on that presumption, unless and until other factors came to light that were sufficient to overcome that presumption.173 Even apart from the presumption of legality, it is unreasonable to demand that, to be \"legitimate\" (*i.e.* objectively reasonable under the ECT), the Claimant\u2019s expectation on the lawfulness of the Special Regime reach the level of *certainty*. In the absence of a binding decision by a competent authority, a decision which did not exist at the time the Claimant formed its expectations and still does not exist today, it is difficult to see how a reasonable investor could have been *certain* at that time that the Special Regime was or was not in accord with EU or Spanish law.\n\nSee **CL-0016**, *SPP v. Egypt*, \u00b6\u00b6 82, 83.\n\n132.\n\nThe question is, then, whether having regard to all the relevant circumstances, it was objectively reasonable for the Claimant to rely on the legality of the Special Regime or, more precisely, whether from the standpoint of a reasonable investor there were sufficient elements to overcome the presumption of legality of that regime, so that it would have been objectively *un* reasonable to rely on it. The key facts are the following:\n\na. Article 108(3) of the TFEU requires member states to notify the EC of \"any plans to grant or alter aid;\"174\n\nb. As Article 108(3) is a general rule, it is necessary to determine whether a particular subsidies scheme, such as the Special Regime, falls under it;\n\nc. No competent authority determined, either at the time the Claimant was forming its expectations or thereafter, that the Special Regime fell under Article 108(3);175\n\nd. The Respondent was aware of its obligation to notify under Article 108(3), as it had notified certain proposed schemes in prior years;176\n\ne. In the relevant period, the EC took a \"rather generous\" approach to the application of the state-aid rules; it approved all energy subsidies schemes submitted to it, including those that offered higher returns than the Special Regime and those that grandfathered existing plants from further 177 reviews;177\n\nf. The Respondent did not notify the Special Regime to the EC;\n\ng. The Claimant\u2019s due-diligence investigation does not appear to have included issues of EU state aid;178\n\nh. The EC was \"well informed\" of the various versions of the Special Regime under Law 54/1997 and even praised it;179\n\ni. The EC did not raise any state-aid issue with Spain in respect of the Special Regime nor did it take any enforcement action while that regime was in effect or thereafter;180\n\nj. Between the enactment of Law 54/1997 and the adoption of the Disputed Measures, the Respondent enjoyed a large increase in investments in the eolic-energy sector in Spain, based on the incentives set forth in the Special Regime;181\n\nk. When the Respondent (belatedly) notified the EC of the Disputed Measures, the EC approved them, but declined to make any determination in respect of the abolished Special Regime;182\n\nl. The Respondent did not question the legality of the Special Regime until this and other arbitration cases.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 410, quoting from Art. 108(3) of the TFEU.\n\nThe Majority concludes that the Special Regime was subject to the notification rule, but it reaches that conclusion, by parity of reasoning, on the basis of the Decision of the EC of 10 November 2017, issued ten years after the time the Claimant was forming its expectations based on the Fourth Regime. See Decision, \u00b6 419.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 418.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 417, quoting from uncontradicted evidence of Claimant\u2019s expert Mr. Carlos Lapuerta.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 424.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 425.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 425, 427.\n\n**CE-1**, Brattle\u2019s First Regulatory Report, \u00b6\u00b6 111-112 (\"Spain added about 2,089 MW per year on average from 2004 up to and including 2009, significantly more than in previous years.\"), relying on **BRR-38** (official source).\n\nDecision, \u00b6 421.\n\n133.\n\nThis set of facts raises two fundamental questions: (i) did the Respondent make any initial determination, at the times the various components of the Subsidies Regime were adopted, whether they fell under Article 108(3) of the TFEU and, if so, what was that determination? and (ii) why did the Respondent fail to give notice to the EC of the various components of the Subsidies Regime?\n\n134.\n\nOn the first question, it should be recalled that the Respondent had a generic obligation under Article 108(3) of the TFEU to notify any state-aid scheme to the EC. As the obligor, the Respondent was responsible for making an initial determination, for its own compliance purposes, that the Special Regime did or did not fall under Article 108(3) of the TFEU. Such a determination, though not conclusive, would have been relevant to a decision by the Respondent whether or not to notify the Special Regime to the EC. Also to be recalled is that no competent authority has ever determined that the Special Regime was or was not subject to notification under Article 108(3). The Majority does find that the Special Regime was subject to notification, but the Tribunal is not a competent authority to rule on this matter.183 In any event, the Majority\u2019s finding is based, by \"parity of reasoning,\" on an EC decision dated 10 November 2017.184 No such *ex post facto* determination can be relevant to ascertain how the Respondent viewed the matter in 1997 (when Law 54/1997 was enacted) or in 2007 (when RD 661/2007 was issued), or to assess the Claimant\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations at the relevant times.\n\nThe Majority takes the view that \"this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to interpret EU law itself.\" Decision, \u00b6 432. In my view, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to rule on the question whether the Special Regime was subject to notification under Article 108(3) of the TFEU because EU law is not part of the law which the Tribunal is charged with applying in this case.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 419.\n\n135.\n\nThe record contains no evidence of (i) any determination, made by the Respondent at any time, that the Special Regime did or did not fall under Article 108(3) of the TFEU or (ii) the reasons for the Respondent\u2019s failure to give notice to the EC under that provision.185 Nevertheless, in the absence of evidence let us consider the various possibilities from the standpoint of a reasonable investor.\n\nThe burden of proof on these matters falls on the Respondent, to the extent that they are necessary elements of its defence based on EU state-aid law. That is so, for two reasons: (i) it was the Respondent which invoked its own failure to notify the Special Regime as an affirmative defence (*actori incumbit onus probandi*; *reus in excipiendo fit actor*), and (ii) the Respondent is the only party capable of providing such evidence.\n\n136.\n\nFirst, the Respondent may have studied the matter and concluded that the Special Regime did not fall under Article 108(3), either because it was originally designed not to involve payments from the state treasury or for other reasons. In such case, that conclusion may very well have been the reason for not notifying the scheme to the EC. But if the state had any doubt about its initial determination (which after all was not conclusive), it would have been bound to disclose both the determination and the doubts, to comply with the requirement of transparency under Article 10(1) of the ECT. No such disclosure having been made, it would have been objectively reasonable for an investor to conclude that the state had satisfied itself (by consulting with the EC or otherwise) that the Special Regime was not subject to Article 108(3) and that no risk of illegality existed.\n\n137.\n\nSecond, the Respondent may have concluded that the Special Regime indeed fell under Article 108(3). In such case, the Respondent may have had various reasons for not giving notice to the EC despite its own conclusion that notice was required. For example, the state may have decided not to notify the Special Regime to preserve a defence of illegality in the event it wished to repudiate its commitments in the future \u2013 a case of bad faith which can be entertained as a hypothesis but cannot be taken as established without adequate proof. Alternatively, the state may have considered that, given the EC\u2019s actual knowledge of the Special Regime, its favourable opinion of it, its generous approach toward the application of state-aid rules to energy projects based on renewable sources, and its willingness to approve such schemes even if they were not notified at the proper time, the required notification was as a simple formality which could have been accomplished later if necessary. As a third alternative, the state may have had other reasons for the absence of notice, including a simple oversight. In all those scenarios, the Respondent\u2019s decision not to give notice would have involved a risk to the recipients of the subsidies \u2013 a risk of which the Respondent would have been aware, having concluded (by hypothesis) that notice was indeed required. In such circumstances, transparency would have required the Respondent to disclose to the investors its conclusion that the Special Regime was subject to notice and the risks resulting from its decision not to notify. Absent such a disclosure, a reasonable investor would have had no grounds to believe that the Respondent had reached that conclusion or that it was consciously subjecting investors to the risks of illegality and disgorgement of the subsidies.\n\n138.\n\nThird, and least likely, the Respondent may simply have overlooked making an initial determination whether the Special Regime fell under Article 108(3) and such oversight may have been the reason for its failure to notify the EC. Under that hypothesis, the absence of notice and the consequent illegality of the Special Regime under EU law would have been the result of the state\u2019s negligence. In such case, it would be unreasonable and inconsistent with the ECT standard of fair and equitable treatment to place the harmful consequences of the state\u2019s negligence on the investor\u2019s shoulders. A reasonable investor cannot be held to a higher standard of diligence than the state itself, on a matter concerning the state\u2019s compliance with its own obligations.186\n\nSee **RL-0090**, *Cube*, \u00b6 306 (\"The obligations regarding State aid were incumbent upon the Respondent, and investors were entitled to assume that they had been taken into account by the Respondent when drafting its legislation. It was not for the Claimants to second-guess the Respondent\u2019s legislature. Moreover, at the time that the investments were made it was not at all clear that the tariff regime should be regarded as State aid, let alone as impermissible State aid.\"); **RL-0096**, Dissenting Opinion of Horacio Grigera Na\u00f3n, \u00b6\u00b6 29-42 (analysis coinciding in several respect with that in the text), in **RL-0095**, *BayWa r.e. Renewable Energy GmbH and BayWa r.e. Asset Holding GmbH v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/16), Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum, 2 December 2019. In *Cavalum*, the tribunal noted that neither Spain nor the EC ever had any concerns that the RD 661/2007 regime was contrary to state aid rules. The tribunal stated that, given its conclusions, the respondent\u2019s state-aid argument had not arisen, \"but if it had arisen, the Tribunal would have dismissed it on the basis that there is no necessary connection between an investor\u2019s legitimate expectation of a reasonable rate of return and a failure by the State to notify state aid, and that in any event *it was not now open to Spain in the light of its prior conduct to raise it*.\" **RL-0102**, *Cavalum SGPS, S.A. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/34), Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum, 31 August 2020, \u00b6 611 (emphasis added).\n\n139.\n\nIn light of the relevant facts and the preceding analysis of alternative answers to questions not covered by the evidence, it must be concluded that, under the fair-and-equitable-treatment standard of the ECT, no elements were available to a reasonable investor to overcome the presumption of legality of the Special Regime \u2013 even if the investor knew or could have discovered that the Respondent had failed to notify the Special Regime to the EC. The key issue is who should bear the injurious consequences of the Respondent\u2019s own failure to notify the Special Regime to the EC, if any such notification was indeed required. Whether that omission was in good or bad faith, malicious or negligent, the result is the same: it was the state\u2019s own conduct which caused the illegality, or risk of illegality, of the Special Regime under EU law, while the state benefited from the investments induced by that regime over a span of more than sixteen years. It is hardly consistent with the principle of good faith for the state now to seize on its own breach of duty to shift the entire burden of that breach on the investor, nor does it seem consistent with a sense of juridical propriety for a tribunal to condone such result.187\n\nSee **CL-0105**, Cheng, Bin, GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AS APPLIED BY INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS, Cambridge 1953, 2006, pp. 149 *et seq*. (\"A State may not invoke its own illegal act to diminish its own liability\"), citing, *e.g.*, PCIJ, Advisory Opinion No. 15 (1928) (\"Poland could not avail herself of an objection which [\u2026] would amount to relying upon the non-fulfilment of an obligation imposed upon her by an international agreement.\").\n\n**IV. CONCLUSION**\n------------------\n\n140.\n\nFor the reasons and to the extent set forth in the preceding sections, I dissent from the Majority\u2019s decisions concerning (i) the application of EU law, (ii) the claims based on Article 10(1) of the ECT, and (iii) the effects of EU law on state aid, and from the Majority\u2019s reasoning supporting those decisions.\n\n141.\n\nI have explained to what extent and why the Tribunal should have upheld the Claimant\u2019s claims based on the first three sentences of Article 10(1) of the ECT. If this conclusion had been accepted, the quantum of compensation would have had to be calculated under principles different from those set forth in the Decision. Accordingly, my dissent should be understood consequentially to include the directions on quantum and other ancillary results."}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability\n--------------------------------------\n\n**SELECT TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS/DEFINED TERMS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| APPA | Association of Renewable Energy Producers (by its Spanish acronym: *Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de energ\u00edas renovables*) |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| BDO Expert Report | Expert report of BDO, entitled \u2018Expert economic-financial report on the EURUS wind farms\u2019 of 11 April 2017 |\n| BOE | Official State Journal (by its Spanish acronym: *Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado*) |\n| Brattle | Claimant\u2019s regulatory and quantum experts |\n| Brattle First Quantum Report | Expert report of Brattle, entitled \u2018Financial Damages to Investors\u2019 dated 18 November 2016 |\n| Brattle First Regulatory Report | Expert report of Brattle, entitled \u2018Changes to the Regulation of Wind Installations in Spain Since December 2012\u2019 dated 18 November 2016 |\n| Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report | Rebuttal report of Brattle, entitled \u2018Financial Damages to Eurus\u2019 dated 29 September 2017 |\n| Brattle Rebuttal Regulatory Report | Rebuttal report of Brattle, entitled \u2018Changes to the Regulation of Wind Installations in Spain Since December 2012\u2019 dated 29 September 2017 |\n| C-[#] | Claimant\u2019s Exhibit |\n| CL-[#] | Claimant\u2019s Legal Authority |\n| Cl.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\u2018**ICSID**\u2019 or the \u2018**Centre**\u2019) on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty, which entered into force for Spain on 16 April 1998 and for Japan on 21 October 2002 (the \u2018**ECT**\u2019),1 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \u2018**ICSID Convention**\u2019).\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7, 8, 54.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (\u2018**Spain**\u2019 or \u2018**Respondent**\u2019).\n\n3.\n\nInitially there were two Claimants, Eurus Energy Holdings Corporation (\u2018**Eurus Japan**\u2019), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Japan,2 and Eurus Energy Europe BV (\u2018**Eurus Europe**\u2019) a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, wholly owned by Eurus Japan and itself the holder of shares and other interests in 13 Spanish special purpose companies (\u2018**SPC**\u2019) which own and operate wind farms in Spain (the \u2018**Wind Farms**\u2019). As recited in paragraph 36 below, by Procedural Order No. 4 of 11 June 2018, the Tribunal allowed Eurus Europe\u2019s application to withdraw from the arbitration on condition as to costs attributable to its participation. As a result, the arbitration proceeded with Eurus Japan as sole Claimant.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 7; Eurus Japan is jointly owned by Toyota Tsusho Corporation (60 percent) and Tokyo Electric Power Company, Inc (40 percent).\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to in this Decision as the \u2018**Parties**\u2019, and the term \u2018**Party**\u2019 is used to refer to either Claimant or Respondent. The Parties\u2019 current representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION**\n--------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 19 February 2016, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 17 February 2016, together with exhibits C-0001 to C-0023 (the \u2018**Request for Arbitration**\u2019).\n\n6.\n\nOn 1 March 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \u2018**ICSID Institution Rules**\u2019).\n\n**B. TRIBUNAL\u2019S CONSTITUTION**\n------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Parties agreed that the Tribunal would be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and would consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party (\u2018**Co-Arbitrators**\u2019), and the third arbitrator, the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.3\n\nClaimant\u2019s letters of 16 March 2016 and 25 March 2016; Respondent\u2019s communications of 21 March 2016 and 30 March 2016.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Judge James Crawford, an Australian national, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr. Oscar M. Garibaldi, an Argentine and United States national, appointed by Claimant; and Professor Andrea Giardina, an Italian national, appointed by Respondent. Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nOn 2 May 2016, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date.\n\n**C. FIRST SESSION AND PARTIES\u2019 PLEADINGS**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Arbitral Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 20 July 2016 via teleconference.\n\n11.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 7 September 2016, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provided, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules are those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages are English and Spanish, and that the place of the proceedings was to be Paris, France. Procedural Order No. 1 set out the agreed schedule for a combined jurisdictional and merits hearing.\n\n12.\n\nOn 18 November 2016, the Claimant submitted its Memorial (\u2018**Claimant\u2019s Memorial**\u2019), together with exhibits C-0001 to C-0445, legal authorities CL-0001 to CL-0078; three witness statements of Mr. Masaaki Matsuoka (CW-1), Mr. Shigehito Nakamura (CW-2), and Mr. Tetsuya Suwabe (CW-3), and three expert reports prepared by Mr. Carlos Lapuerta and Mr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Garc\u00eda (The Brattle Group) (CE-1), by Mr. Carlos Lapuerta and Mr. Richard Caldwell (The Brattle Group) (CE-2), and by Dr. Joseph F. Rakow (Exponent) (CE-3).\n\n13.\n\nOn 12 April 2017, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction (\u2018**Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial**\u2019), together with exhibits R-0001 to R-0259, legal authorities RL-0001 to RL-0067, the witness statement of Mr. Juan Ram\u00f3n Ayuso (RW-1), and an expert report prepared by Messrs. Gervase MacGregor, Eduardo P\u00e9rez Ruiz, David Mitchell, and Francisco Javier Espel Ses\u00e9 (BDO).\n\n14.\n\nOn 1 June 2017, the Parties submitted a joint request to the Tribunal regarding the proposed timetable for the document-production phase.\n\n15.\n\nOn 13 June 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the Parties\u2019 Document Requests.\n\n16.\n\nFollowing exchanges between the Parties and the Tribunal, on 18 September 2017, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing dates would be moved to 16-20 July 2018 in Paris.\n\n17.\n\nOn 19 September 2017, the Tribunal approved the Parties\u2019 joint proposal for the amended timetable for the document production phase.\n\n18.\n\nOn 22 September 2017, the Respondent filed exhibit R-0260, which had inadvertently not been submitted with the Counter-Memorial, as well as the corrected version of the consolidated exhibit list.\n\n19.\n\nOn 30 September 2017, the Claimant submitted its Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (\u2018**Claimant\u2019s Reply**\u2019), together with exhibits C-0446 to C-0481, legal authorities CL-0079 to CL-0093; supplemental witness statements of Mr. Masaaki Matsuoka (CW-4) and Mr. Tetsuya Suwabe (CW-5); rebuttal expert reports prepared by Mr. Carlos Lapuerta and Mr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Garc\u00eda (The Brattle Group) (CE-4), and by Mr. Carlos Lapuerta and Mr. Richard Caldwell (The Brattle Group) (CE-5), as well as an expert report of Mr. Koichi Sekiya (Ernst & Young Japan) (CE-6).\n\n20.\n\nFollowing the Claimant\u2019s communication of 19 September 2017, the Tribunal confirmed on 6 October 2017 that the Hearing would take place on 16-21, and 23 July 2018, with 24 July 2018 held in reserve.\n\n21.\n\nOn 27 November 2017, the Tribunal approved the Parties\u2019 agreement to extend the deadline for the submission of Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction to 22 December 2017. Accordingly, the Parties agreed to extend the deadline for the submission of the Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction to 8 February 2018. All other dates in the procedural timetable would remain unchanged.\n\n22.\n\nOn 4 December 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties that Ms. Celeste Salinas Quero had been appointed to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal, replacing Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu.\n\n23.\n\nOn 22 December 2017, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction (\u2018**Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder**\u2019), together with exhibits R-0260 to R-0339, legal authorities RL-0068 to RL-0086, the second witness statement of Mr. Juan Ram\u00f3n Ayuso, and a second expert report prepared by Messrs. Gervase MacGregor, Eduardo P\u00e9rez Ruiz, David Mitchell, and Francisco Javier Espel Ses\u00e9 (BDO).\n\n24.\n\nOn 8 February 2018, the Claimant submitted its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\u2018**Claimant\u2019s****Rejoinder**\u2019), together with exhibits C-0482 to C-0485, and legal authorities CL-0094 to CL-0111.\n\n25.\n\nOn 28 March 2018, the Claimant filed a request to introduce into the record the award issued in *Novenergia II \u2013 Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), SICAR v. Kingdom of Spain* (SCC Arbitration 2015/063) (\u2018***Novenergia II***\u2019) (**CL-0112**). Additionally, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal order that \u2018arbitral awards involving Spain and relating to the Disputed Measures that might become publicly available before the close of these proceedings can be submitted into the record without the need to follow the procedure set out in Section 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1.\u20194\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 28 March 2018.\n\n26.\n\nOn 17 April 2018, Spain replied accepting the Claimant\u2019s requests under certain conditions and proposed to amend the procedure set out in Section 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1 to incorporate legal authorities into the record. The Respondent also proposed to submit into the record, among others, the *Achmea* judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u2018**CJEU**\u2019).5\n\n*Slowakische Republik (Slovak Republic) v. Achmea BV*, Case C 284/16, 6 March 2018 (\u2018***Achmea***\u2019). The Claimant accepted Respondent\u2019s proposal to add to the record the CJEU\u2019s *Achmea* judgment and the Tribunal permitted its addition at \u00b6 7 of Procedural Order No. 3 of 17 May 2018. Ultimately, however, neither Party submitted the *Achmea* judgment as a numbered legal authority to the record. The Parties referred to the *Achmea* judgment (i) in subsequent written submissions regarding the European Commission\u2019s Application to participate as non-disputing party and Respondent\u2019s request to add into the record the Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on investment protection in the European Union, (ii) in oral argument at the hearing on jurisdiction and merits, and (iii) when commenting on many of the legal authorities added to the record after the hearing that referred to *Achmea*.\n\n27.\n\nOn 27 April 2018, the Claimant filed a response to Spain\u2019s letter of 17 April 2018. The Claimant rejected Spain\u2019s proposal, but it \u2018agree[d] to the admission of the decision in *Achmea* case.\u20196\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 27 April 2018.\n\n**D. THE WITHDRAWAL OF EURUS EUROPE, THE HEARING ON JURISDICTION ANDTHE MERITS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nOn 11 May 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that Eurus Europe was to discontinue its claims. On the same day, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on Eurus Energy Europe B.V.\u2019s withdrawal request by 16 May 2018.\n\n29.\n\nOn 17 May 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the admission of documentary evidence. In particular, Procedural Order No. 3 amended section 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, incorporating Section 16.3.3.3 so as to allow a Party to submit into the record awards or decisions that become public before the close of the proceedings and that have been rendered in cases brought against Spain in the renewable energy sector. In such case, the Party submitting the award was entitled to make comments of no more than five pages and the other Party to submit a response of the same length. The Tribunal also admitted into the record, *inter alia*, the award issued in *Novenergia II* and the CJEU\u2019s decision in *Achmea*. Pursuant to this provision, a number of further decisions/awards were submitted into the record and the Parties were afforded an opportunity to submit comments. These comments have been duly taken into account in what follows.\n\n30.\n\nOn 18 May 2018, Spain submitted a response to the Claimant\u2019s letter of 11 May 2018 concerning Eurus Energy Europe B.V.\u2019s withdrawal request.\n\n31.\n\nOn the same day, 18 May 2018, the Claimant submitted a letter noting that the Tribunal had instructed Spain to provide its comments on the discontinuance of Eurus Europe\u2019s claims by no later than close of business in Washington, D.C. on 16 May 2018.7 Since the deadline had elapsed without a response from Spain, the Claimant argued that Spain had \u2018acquiesced in the discontinuance\u2019.8\n\nCommunication from ICSID to the Parties of 11 May 2018.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 18 May 2018.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter of 21 May 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the issue of discontinuance of claims would be discussed during the upcoming pre-hearing organizational teleconference scheduled for 5 June 2018.\n\n33.\n\nOn 22 May 2018, the Claimant submitted the award in *Novenergia II* and the award issued by the tribunal in *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1), dated 16 May 2018 (\u2018***Masdar***\u2019) (**CL-0113**).\n\n34.\n\nOn 1 June 2018, the Respondent filed its comments on the *Novenergia II* award.9\n\nPursuant to Section 6 of Procedural Order No. 3 and amended paragraph 16.3.3.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties had the opportunity to comment on the award issued in *Masdar* at the hearing on jurisdiction and merits.\n\n35.\n\nA pre-hearing procedural teleconference was held on 5 June 2018, regarding the organization of the hearing to be held from 18-21 and 23 July 2018, at the International Chamber of Commerce (the \u2018**ICC**\u2019) in Paris, France.\n\n36.\n\nOn 11 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on the withdrawal of Eurus Energy Europe B.V.\u2019s claims. In its Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal, after reciting the positions of the Parties, noted that ICSID Rule 44, under which Eurus Europe had requested the withdrawal of its claims, deals with the \u2018discontinuance of the proceeding\u2019, but that Rule 44 is silent about partial discontinuance, such as when one party wishes to withdraw all its claims, while the proceeding continues between the remaining parties in relation to the remaining claims. The Tribunal held that it had discretion to allow partial discontinuance, based on the authority that ICSID Convention Article 44 gives to tribunals to decide questions that are not covered by the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties.10 As to the exercise of that discretion, the Tribunal considered that late withdrawal of a party should not be permitted if the respondent objects and can demonstrate prejudice, including the potential loss of a *res judicata* against the withdrawing party. On the other hand, the late timing of Eurus Europe\u2019s withdrawal had been explained by the Claimants and by recent developments, in particular, the *Achmea* judgment of the CJEU and the ruling of the Dutch tax authorities. Taking into account that allowing the withdrawal of Eurus Europe\u2019s claims would simplify the proceedings, saving time and some costs, and that any prejudice to the Respondent was largely notional because, in any event, the Claimants had stated that they would not seek damages in favour of Eurus Europe, the Tribunal decided to allow Eurus Europe\u2019s withdrawal, subject to Eurus Japan\u2019s undertaking to comply with any order for the costs attributable to Eurus Europe\u2019s involvement in this arbitration.11\n\nThe Tribunal referred to *Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A, Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua, S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17), Procedural Order No. 1 Concerning the Discontinuance of Proceedings with Respect to Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A., 14 April 2006; *Aguas Argentinas S.A. Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19), Procedural Order No. 1 Concerning the Discontinuance of Proceedings with Respect to Aguas Argentinas S.A., 14 April 2006, and *International Company for Railway Systems (ICRS), Privatization Holding Company (PHC) v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/13), Procedural Order No. 1 Concerning the Discontinuance of Proceedings with Respect to Privatization Holding Company (PHC), 26 February 2010.\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, 11 June 2018.\n\n37.\n\nOn 12 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 reflecting the Parties\u2019 agreements and the Tribunal\u2019s decisions on procedural matters concerning the organization and logistical arrangements of the hearing to be held from 18-21 and 23 July 2018, at the ICC in Paris, France.\n\n38.\n\nOn 12 July 2018, the Claimant submitted two awards as new legal authorities: *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31), Award, 15 June 2018 (\u2018***Antin***\u2019) (**CL-0114**) and *Antaris GmbH and Dr. Michael G\u00f6de v. Czech Republic* (PCA Case No. 2014-01), Award, 2 May 2018 (\u2018***Antaris***\u2019) (**CL-0115**).12\n\nPursuant to Section 6 of Procedural Order No. 3 and amended paragraph 16.3.3.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties had the opportunity to comment on the awards issued in *Antin* and *Antaris* at the hearing on jurisdiction and merits.\n\n39.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held at the ICC in Paris from 18-21 and 23 July 2018 (the \u2018**Hearing**\u2019).

By communication of the same date, the Tribunal asked the Claimant to submit comments on the Respondent\u2019s request by 24 September 2018.\n\n50.\n\nOn 21 September 2018, the Claimant submitted its comments on the Respondent\u2019s request of 19 September 2018.\n\n51.\n\nBy communication of the same date, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed on the corrections to the English-language transcripts and would send them to the English court reporter in accordance with section 21.3 of Procedural Order No. 1. The Claimant also informed the Tribunal that the Parties had failed to agree on certain corrections to the Spanish-language transcripts. The Claimant requested that the Tribunal decide on certain corrections proposed by Spain to the Spanish-language hearing transcripts.\n\n52.\n\nOn September 25, 2018, the Respondent confirmed that there was disagreement on certain issues of translation in the Spanish-language transcripts.\n\n53.\n\nOn 9 October 2018, the Tribunal issued its decisions on the Respondent\u2019s request of 19 September 2018 and the Claimant\u2019s request of 21 September 2018.\n\n54.\n\nOn 12 October 2018, counsel for the Claimant sent to the English court reporter, Mr. McGowan, the corrections agreed by the Parties to be entered to the English-language transcripts. On the same date and by separate email, counsel for the Claimant sent to the Spanish court reporter, Mr. Rinaldi, the corrections to the Spanish-language transcripts adopted by the Tribunal.\n\n55.\n\nOn 16 October 2018, Mr. Rinaldi sent to the Parties and the Tribunal the final versions of the Spanish-language transcripts.\n\n56.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it was prepared to submit: (i) redacted copies of the relevant pages of Freshfields\u2019 Tokyo office\u2019s bank statements, showing all relevant fund transfers received by Freshfields (with translations from Japanese to English); and (ii) a copy of the cover page of Freshfields\u2019 latest invoice to Eurus, which has been accepted but not yet paid out in the ordinary course.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION\u2019S APPLICATION TO INTERVENE**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nOn 5 November 2018, the European Commission filed an Application for Leave to intervene as a Non-Disputing Party pursuant to Rule 37(2) dated 29 October 2018 (the \u2018**European Commission\u2019s Application**\u2019). The Commission sought leave to intervene on the applicability of Article 26 of the ECT to intra-EU disputes and on EU law on state aid as applicable law to the merits precluding an award on damages against Spain.\n\n62.\n\nOn 6 November 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit comments on the European Commission\u2019s Application by 13 November 2018.\n\n63.\n\nOn 8 November 2018, the Claimant submitted its observations on the European Commission\u2019s Application opposing the Application on grounds of delay, costs and its irrelevance to the case as now constituted.\n\n64.\n\nOn 13 November 2018, the Respondent submitted its observations on the European Commission\u2019s Application, supporting the Application on grounds of its materiality to the issues before the Tribunal.\n\n65.\n\nOn 28 November 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was minded to grant conditional leave to the European Commission\u2019s Application confined to the issue of state aid as a substantive matter. The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit further comments on the European Commission\u2019s Application on the substantive issue of state aid by 5 December 2018.\n\n66.\n\nThe Centre received the Claimant and Respondent\u2019s comments, respectively, on 4 and 5 December 2018.\n\n67.\n\nOn 21 December 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 on the European Commission\u2019s Application. The Tribunal granted the European Commission leave to file by 17 January 2019 a written submission on the issue of state aid. The written submission was subject to a number of conditions, including that the Commission submit by 4 January 2019 \u2018a written undertaking that it will comply with any decision on costs ordered by the Tribunal and attributable to its intervention\u2019 (the \u2018**Undertaking on Costs**\u2019).\n\n68.\n\nOn 4 January 2018, the European Commission submitted a Request to alter the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 6 dated 21 December 2018 (the \u2018**European Commission\u2019s Request**\u2019). The Commission requested that the Tribunal remove the condition of the Undertaking on Costs, or alternatively, that its Application for Leave to Intervene be admitted into the record instead of its proposed submission.\n\n69.\n\nOn 9 January 2019, following an invitation from the Tribunal, each Party submitted observations on the European Commission\u2019s Request.\n\n70.\n\nOn 16 January 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 on the European Commission\u2019s Request. The Tribunal rejected the Commission\u2019s request to waive the condition of an Undertaking on Costs but granted the Commission\u2019s request to introduce into the record the European Commission\u2019s Application instead of its proposed submission. The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit by 31 January 2019 further comments on the Commission\u2019s Application on the issue of state aid.\n\n71.\n\nOn 17 January 2019, the European Commission informed the Tribunal that it was not in a position to comply with the Undertaking on Costs and that it would not file a written submission.\n\n72.\n\nMeanwhile, on 25 January 2019, the Respondent filed a request to introduce into the record as an additional legal authority a Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 15 January 2019, on the legal consequences of the judgment of the CJEU in *Achmea* and on investment protection in the European Union. The declaration was signed by 22 EU Member states. The Respondent argued that the Declaration \u2018addresses many of the same issues relating to Spain\u2019s intra-EU jurisdictional objection.\u2019\n\n73.\n\nOn 31 January 2019, the Parties filed their respective comments on the European Commission\u2019s Application on the issue of state aid. These arguments are dealt with in substance below.\n\n74.\n\nOn 4 February 2019, the Claimant filed its objections to the Respondent\u2019s request, arguing that the Declaration would be irrelevant because there is \u2018no European claimant in this case, and no intra-EU jurisdictional objection\u2019.\n\n75.\n\nOn 7 February 2019, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent\u2019s request, observing *inter alia* \u2018that the Declaration is not unanimous and only deals with intra-EU disputes. On this basis, the Tribunal is of the view that the Declaration is not of such nature as to constitute a decisive factor in the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\u2019\n\n**G. LEGAL AUTHORITIES ADDED POST-HEARING**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nOn 13 February 2019, Mr. McGowan sent to the Parties and the Tribunal the final versions of the English-language transcripts.\n\n77.\n\nOn 11 April 2019, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal admit into the record the decision of the tribunal in *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.)

On 29 April 2019, the Claimant filed its comments on *RREEF*.\n\n**RL-0089**, *RREEF*, Partially Dissenting Opinion by Prof. Robert Volterra, 30 November 2018.\n\n79.\n\nOn 29 April 2019, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal admit into the record the award of the tribunal in *Foresight Luxembourg Solar 1 S.\u00e0 r.l. and others v. Kingdom of Spain* (SCC Case V(2015/150), dated 14 November 2018 (\u2018***Greentech***\u2019) and to exempt the Parties from submitting any comments. The Claimant also requested that the Tribunal direct the Respondent to submit existing awards from arbitrations related to its renewable energy regime and to continue to submit such awards until the Tribunal should indicate otherwise. The Claimant indicated that it was aware of further awards and decisions issued in such cases that had not been made public.14 On 3 May 2019, the Tribunal admitted the *Greentech* award into the record and issued a decision on the filing of awards and decisions. A number of other more recent awards and decisions were also submitted, and the Parties made short presentations on many of these. Those awards and decisions are indicated further below.\n\nThe Claimant referred to the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Partial Decision on Quantum issued on 19 February 2019 in *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV and others v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/20); the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum Principles issued on 12 March 2019 in *NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. and NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/11); and the Decision on the \u2018Intra-EU\u2019 Jurisdictional Objection issued on 25 February 2019 in *Landesbank Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and others v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/45) (\u2018***Landesbank***\u2019).\n\n80.\n\nOn 5 May 2019, the Claimants introduced the *Greentech* award into the record (**CL-0116**) along with its comments thereon. On 24 May 2019, the Respondent submitted its own comments on the award.\n\n81.\n\nOn 29 May 2019, the Respondent introduced into the record the decisions issued in *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV and others v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/20), Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Partial Decision on Quantum, 19 February 2019 (\u2018***Cube***\u2019) (**RL-0090**) and *NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. and NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/11), Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum Principles, 12 March 2019 (\u2018***NextEra***\u2019) (**RL-0091**) and submitted its comments on those decisions.15 On 11 June 2019, the Claimant submitted its own comments on those decisions.\n\nThe Respondent explained that it was not in a position to submit the *Landesbank* decision, pending a decision on confidentiality by the tribunal in that case.\n\n82.\n\nOn 18 June 2019, the Claimant introduced into the record the award of the tribunal in *9REN Holding S.a\u0300.r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/15) dated 31 May 2019 (\u2018***9REN***\u2019) (**CL-0117**) and submitted its comments on the award. On 2 July 2019, the Respondent also submitted into the record the award of the tribunal in *9REN* (**RL-0092**) along with its own comments on the award.\n\n83.\n\nOn 22 July 2019, the Claimant introduced into the record the award of the tribunal in *Cube*, dated 15 July 201916 (**CL-0119**) and requested that the Tribunal exempt the Parties from commenting the award because it \u2018merely implements the Tribunal\u2019s earlier holdings on which the Parties already have commented.\u2019 The Claimant also introduced the Decision on the \u2018Intra-EU\u2019 Jurisdictional Objection of the tribunal *Landesbank*, dated 25 February 2019 (**CL-0118**), which had become public. The Claimant also requested that the Tribunal accept that decision without any comments from the Parties, as the sole issue addressed is the validity of the intra-EU arbitration under the ECT.17\n\n**CL-0119**, *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV and others v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. 15/20), Award, 15 July 2019.\n\nClaimant\u2019s communication of 22 July 2019.\n\n84.\n\nOn 24 July 2019, the Respondent informed that it intended to submit comments on *Landesbank*.\n\n85.\n\nOn 9 August 2019, the Claimant requested that the Respondent submit several awards issued in other arbitrations and that the Tribunal exempt the Parties from submitting comments on those awards.\n\n86.\n\nAfter further exchanges between the Parties on the matter, on 23 August 2019, the Tribunal instructed the Respondent and the Claimant to comment on the decision in *Landesbank*. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that having received their comments on the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability, and Partial Decision on Quantum issued by the tribunal in *Cube*, it saw no need for the Parties\u2019 comments on the award.18\n\nTribunal\u2019s communication of 23 August 2019.\n\n87.\n\nOn 27 August 2019 and on 2 September 2019, the Respondent and the Claimant submitted their comments on *Landesbank*, respectively*.*\n\n88.\n\nOn 3 October 2019, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal direct the Respondent to submit the award of the tribunal in *OperaFund Eco-Invest SICAV PLC and Schwab Holding AG v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/36), dated 6 September 2019 (\u2018***OperaFund***\u2019). On 7 October 2019, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit the award in *OperaFund* and invited the Parties to submit comments thereon.\n\n89.\n\nOn 10 October 2019, the Respondent submitted the award in *OperaFund* (**RL-0093**) (dissenting opinion submitted as **RL-0094**)19 along with its comments thereon. On 23 October 2019, the Claimant submitted its comments.\n\n**RL-0094**, *OperaFund*, Dissent on Liability and Quantum by Prof. Philippe Sands, Q.C., 13 August 2019.\n\n90.\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal direct the Respondent to submit the decision of the tribunal in *BayWa r.e. Renewable Energy GmbH and BayWa r.e. Asset Holding GmbH v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/16), dated 2 December 2019 (\u2018***BayWa***\u2019) and the award of the tribunal in *Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen GmbH, RWE Innogy GmbH, and others v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/1), dated 2 December 2019 (\u2018***Stadtwerke***\u2019).\n\n91.\n\nOn 23 December 2019, the Respondent submitted the decision in *BayWa* (**RL-0095**) (dissenting opinion submitted as **RL-0096**)20 and the award in *Stadtwerke* (**RL-0097**) (dissenting opinion submitted as **RL-0098**)21 along with its comments thereon. On 9 January 2020, the Claimant submitted its comments on the decision and the award. The Claimant also submitted the award of the tribunal in *SolEs Badajoz GmbH v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/38), dated 31 July 2019 (\u2018***SolEs***\u2019) (**CL-0120**)22 and suggested that further comments on the award and other decisions were not necessary. On 9 March 2020, the Respondent indicated that it did not oppose the suggestion of the Claimant, but added that it wished to submit the award rendered in the *PV Investors v. Kingdom of Spain* with comments, unless the Tribunal were to decide that there was no need for such comments from either Party. On 10 March 2020, the Claimant responded that it did not object to Spain\u2019s submitting the *PV Investors v. Spain* award to the record but that it did not believe that comments on this award by the Parties were warranted. On 12 March 2020, the Tribunal thus admitted the award in *SolEs v. Spain* and the award in *PV Investors v. Spain* into the record without comments and invited Spain to submit the latter award as a numbered legal authority. Spain did so on 13 March 2020.23\n\n**RL-0096**, *BayWa*, Dissenting Opinion by Dr. Horacio Grigera Na\u00f3n (undated).\n\n**RL-0098**, *Stadtwerke*, Dissenting Opinion by Prof. Kaj Hob\u00e9r, 20 November 2019.\n\n**CL-0120**, *SolEs Badajoz GmbH v.

Brower, 28 February 2020 (**RL-0100**).\n\n92.\n\nOn 17 June 2020, the Respondent requested leave to submit without comments the *Decision on the Kingdom of Spain\u2019s Application for Annulment rendered on 11 June 2020 in the ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36 Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energ\u00eda Solar Luxembourg S.\u00e1 r.l. v.

Haigh Q.C., 31 August 2020.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe factual background below contains a summary of relevant facts, some of which are disputed between the Parties. This summary does not seek to include all the facts submitted in this proceeding and is without prejudice to the full factual record that has been considered by the Tribunal.\n\n**A. THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SYSTEM AND THE SPECIAL REGIME**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nSpain characterizes the Spanish electricity system (\u2018**SES**\u2019) as \u2018an economic, technical and legal system\u2019 comprising the \u2018set of activities aimed at ensuring the supply of electricity in the Spanish territory.\u201927 The main objective of the SES is to ensure that all consumers have access to electricity in conditions of equality and quality, with electricity produced at the lowest possible cost while having regard to environmental protection.28\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 245.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 271.\n\n96.\n\nSpain explains that participation in the SES is provided for in regulations, which should be understood having regard to the hierarchy of norms within the Spanish legal system. In descending order, these are: The Constitution, Laws, Royal Decree-Laws, Royal Decrees, and Ministerial Orders, subject to the qualification that EU law is part of the Spanish legal system and its implementation is subject to the ultimate jurisdiction of the European courts.29\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 248-255.\n\n97.\n\nThe EU policy on energy and environment, aligned with the Kyoto Protocol,30 sets targets that Spain, as a member state, is required to meet.31 Spain contends that Directive 2001/77/EC32 recognized the need to provide state aid to renewable energy (\u2018**RE**\u2019) in accordance with Community guidelines on state aid for environmental protection.33\n\nKyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (adopted 11 December 1997, entered into force 16 February 2005) 2303 UNTS 162.\n\nResp.

The Parties agree that Law 40/1994 set out a two-tiered system with an \u2018Ordinary Regime\u2019 and a \u2018Special Regime\u2019 of remuneration and that Law 54/1997,38 enacted in November 1997, maintained this two-tiered system.39 The Claimant explains that in this two-tiered system, Special Producers classified as \u2018ordinary\u2019 were subject to a free market pricing system (*i.e.* required to sell their energy on the market through a pooling system) and Special Producers qualifying for the Special Regime, including the Wind Farms, were entitled to receive additional remuneration.40 In particular, Law 54/1997, section 30(4) set out criteria for the determination of premiums \u2018so as to achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of money on capital markets.\u201941\n\n**R-0070**, Law 40/1994 on the regulation of the National Electricity System, 30 December 1994.\n\nResp.

The Claimant and the Respondent relied on the same English translation of Law 54/1997, taken from a 2008 publication by the *Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Energ\u00eda*. The Tribunal also uses said translation, and notes that the translation corresponds to Law 54/1997 as amended by Law 17/2007 of 4 July 2007 and Royal Decree 7/2006 of 23 June 2006. In what respects to Art. 30(4) on the determination of the premiums, the language \"reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of money on capital markets\" (present also in the version of Law 54/1997 published in *the Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado* on 28 November 1997) remained until Art. 30(4) was amended by RD-Law 9/2013.\n\n100.\n\nSpain submits that the Special Regime, created with RD 2366/1994, is based on the principle of reasonable return. A reasonable rate of return involves receiving revenues sufficient to recover the investment costs, operating costs, and make a return in line with market criteria. The methodology involves (i) a standard facility, recognizing and reconstructing an economic operating structure, identifying the investment, operating and maintenance costs according to market criteria and with the performance of a \u2018diligent investor\u2019 and (ii) setting a target for the economic return for a given period of time, which is dynamic, balanced and proportionate, in accordance with the capital market. This target should be achieved through the sum of a) the market price and b) subsidies. Spain submits that it has historically used this methodology in its Plans for Promotion of Renewable Energies (\u2018**PFER**\u2019) of 1986,42 1989,43 2000-201044 and 2005-2010.45\n\n**W-R-0260**, PFER 1986.\n\n**R-0083**, PFER 1989.\n\n**R-0118**, PFER 2000-2010.\n\n**R-0119**, PFER 2005-2010; Resp.

Law 54/1997 began to deregulate the SES as a result of EU requirements to encourage competition and the efficiency of the electricity sector.46\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 256-261.\n\n102.\n\nSpain argues that the Tribunal should analyse the changes introduced to the SES taking into account the principle of economic sustainability. That principle justifies the regulatory intervention in the income and costs of the SES, including the costs of subsidizing RE.47 This intervention, however, is limited to ensuring RE producers a reasonable return according to the cost of money in the capital market, pursuant to Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997.48 This return, Spain argues, was linked to the construction and operating costs of the plants.49\n\nResp.

The Claimant disagrees with Spain\u2019s proposition that the inclusion of the language \u2018reasonable profitability\u2019 in Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997 has the meaning that Spain *now* wishes to attribute to it, *i.e.* that incentives for existing facilities were always subject to an undefined cap to keep them consistent with said language. For the Claimant, a guarantee of a reasonable rate of profitability means that minimum levels of profitability were to be assured, not that profitability would be capped.50\n\nHearing Day 1, p. 49, ll 17-23 (Mr. Lingard).\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimant notes that years later when Spain used the language \u2018reasonable rate of return\u2019 in an implementing regulation, namely, in Article 44(3) of Royal Decree 661/2007 (\u2018**RD 661/2007**\u2019)51 which governs the conditions for updating and review of incentives available to special procedures, said provision expressly clarified that revisions would not apply to existing facilities:\n\n3. During the year 2010, on sight of the results of the monitoring reports on the degree of fulfilment of the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2005-2010, and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), together with such new targets as may be included in the subsequent Renewable Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with regard to the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its impact upon the technical and economic management of the system, and a reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference to the cost of money in the capital markets. Subsequently a further review shall be performed every four years, maintaining the same criteria as previously.\n\nThe revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January of the second year following the year in which the revision shall have been performed.52\n\n**R-0101** or **C-0008**, Royal Decree 661/2007 of 25 May, regulating the production of electrical energy under the Special Regime.\n\nHearing Day 1, p. 49, ll 6-25 (Mr. Lingard); p. 50, citing **C-0008** (or **R-0101**), RD 661/2007, Art. 44(3).\n\n105.\n\nFor the Claimant, the inclusion of what it characterizes as a \u2018stabilization clause\u2019 in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 immediately after the discussion of guaranteeing reasonable rates of profitability according to the cost of money in the capital markets, is explained by the fact that if Spain had said in Law 54/1997 that overall investments were subject to an undefined cap on investment returns, Spain simply would not have attracted the investment it hoped to attract. The Claimant would not have invested in Spain, much less expanded its investment over the years.53\n\nHearing Day 1, p. 51, ll 1-7 (Mr. Lingard).\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimant also supports its position on the meaning of \u2018reasonable rate of return\u2019 referring to the language of Article 36 of RD 661/2007, regulating the relationship between the remuneration to receive and the passage of time. The Claimant notes that the regulated tariff would be maintained at one level for 15 years, and then reduced but still available \u2018thereafter.\u2019 The use of the word \u2018thereafter,\u2019 the Claimant submits, means an indefinite period, without any indication that the incentives would be capped once the facility had reached a target rate of return.54\n\nHearing Day 1, p. 48, ll 23-25 (Mr. Lingard); p. 49, ll 1-5 (Mr. Lingard); Cl.

Spain contends that the creation of the RAIPRE shows the intention of the regulator to monitor compliance with the targets set out in Spain\u2019s energy plants.57 The Claimant argues that registration in RAIPRE entitled Special Producers to certain incentives, as set out in Article 23 of RD 2818/1998, subject to modification every four years based on defined criteria.58\n\nResp.

The premium for wind power facilities with less than 50 MW installed capacity was 5.26 pesetas per kWh, which, combined with the market price, would be the price that Special Producers could receive. Special Producers were also given the option to receive a fixed rate of 11.02 pesetas per kWh. As noted, the premiums would be subject to review every four years.\n\n110.\n\nThe listed criteria to be applied in the quadrennial review of premiums did not include \u2018a quantitative limit on the amount of remuneration a facility could receive.\u201959 Spain contends, however, that since the premiums were subject to review, \u2018no investor could undertake an investment trusting in the grandfathering of the remunerative regime established by RD 2818/1998.\u201960\n\nCl.

Each standard facility was subject to standards of investment costs, operating costs, useful life, hours of rewarded production, and market price.

The TMR, or what Claimant\u2019s describes as the \u2018reference tariff\u2019 was defined in RD 1432/2002.65 Article 4 of RD 1432/2002 provided for the reference tariff to be calculated according to a formula that took into account various costs and considerations. For the Claimant, the relevance of RD 1432/2002 was that it stabilized the calculation of incentives under the Special Regime by anchoring them to the TMR or \u2018reference tariff.\u201966\n\n**C-0006** or **R-0099**, RD 1432/2002, of 27 December 2002.\n\nCl.

For wind power facilities with installed capacities above 5 MW the premium and incentive were fixed at 40% and 10%, respectively.

Further, Spain explains that the premium given to RE installations under RD 436/2004 was a percentage of the TMR. This meant that, if the installed power increased, the costs associated with the production of RE subject to the Special Regime also increased. This led to an increase of the TMR,73 which led in turn to an increase in the Special Regime production costs, because the tariffs and premiums were a percentage of the TMR. RD 436/2004 thus \u2018caused perverse effects for the sustainability of the SES.\u201974 Among other factors, an increase in oil prices caused an increase in the price of energy as high as 50-60 Euros/MW. This led to a situation where most facilities opted for remuneration according to the market price plus a premium, obtaining much higher returns than those envisaged by the regulator.75 This situation led to the approval of RD-Law 7/2006, the preamble of which highlighted the inefficiency of the then-current remuneration system.76\n\nResp.

FITs enable energy producers to receive payment for the energy generated, taking into account the producer\u2019s costs, rather than solely the market price for electricity. FITs allow energy production methods that have higher costs, like wind power, to achieve predictable and stable profitability.90 The Claimant alleges that Spain\u2019s special incentives, including FITs, were the primary reason why the Claimant invested in Spain.91\n\nCl.

In May 1997, financial advisors commissioned by SeaWest Espa\u00f1a and Tomen issued a preliminary financial memorandum to attract financing for the project. The memorandum set out the advisor\u2019s independent view of the Special Regime, stating that \u2018a major adverse change in the Government\u2019s policy towards renewable energy generally, and wind energy in particular, is highly unlikely in the foreseeable future.\u201997\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 67, citing **C-0045**, First Babcock Memorandum, May 1997, \u00b6 11.7.\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimant says that the Special Regime was the primary reason for Tomen to decide to invest in Spain, with the expectation that Spain\u2019s commitments to the promotion of RE was reliable and durable. The Claimant further states that, even if Spain were to change the Special Regime, the Claimant expected that those changes would not retroactively affect existing wind power plants.98 In March 1997, Tomen decided to invest in Spain, in what became the Paxareiras I and II A wind power facilities.99\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 69.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 70.\n\n130.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2008, the Claimant made a series of investments, in each case through Eurus Europe, in Spanish wind farms.100 In all but two cases, Eurus\u2019s interest in the operating SPCs was 50%; in one it was 12.5%; in another, it was 48.5%. These investments were approved and made under the auspices of successive Spanish laws (Law 40/1994, replaced by Law 54/1997) and Royal Decrees (RD 2366/1994; RD 2818/1998; RD 436/2004; and RD 661/2007). The Parties dispute the impact of these various changes, and the Tribunal will return to that issue in due course. But despite these fluctuations, the Special Regime instituted by these laws and decrees retained the character of a system in which the remuneration of renewable energy producers included a subsidy over the market price.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 65-123; Cl. Mem., Appendix II.\n\n131.\n\nStarting in 2005, however, the SES began to show an increasing deficit, which over time grew substantially. By 2013, the accumulated deficit was almost EUR 30 billion.101 The Parties disagree on the causes of the deficit. The Respondent takes the view that the main cause of the deficit was the extent of subsidies payable to producers under the Special Regime. The Claimant contends that the main cause was Spain\u2019s reluctance to transfer to consumers the full cost of the system. Whatever the causes, the accumulated deficit and other factors would lead in 2012-2014 to a significant change in Spanish policy with regard to the calculation of subsidies.102\n\nResp.

Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 262-266.\n\n132.\n\nWhat the Claimant describes as a \u2018temporary precursor\u2019 to this overhaul was RD 1614/2010, which imposed production limits on and temporarily reduced incentives for, *inter alia*, wind power facilities.103 Under Article 2 of RD 1614/2010, the energy produced above specified limits would not qualify for financial incentives. In relevant part, Article 2(4) provided:\n\n4. For wind technology facilities on land, the number of benchmark equivalent hours will be 2,589 hours/year when, in a calendar year, the median annual operational hours of all the wind technology facilities on land with a definitive registration [\u2026] exceed 2,350 hours/year.\n\nFor facilities registered definitively in the administrative Register of production facilities operating under the special system [\u2026] on 7 May 2009 [\u2026] the benchmark values for annual equivalent hours, 2,350 and 2,589 hours/year, cannot be revised during their operational life.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 126, citing **C-0010**, RD 1614/2010, Art. 2.\n\n133.\n\nSpain explains that RD 1614/2010 was adopted to guarantee the economic sustainability of the SES and resolve certain inefficiencies regarding wind and other technologies, as stated in its preamble.104 In Spain\u2019s view, this showed that RE producers were aware that the economic sustainability of the SES could prompt changes affecting existing facilities. Also, energy sector associations had urged the adoption of measures to reform the Special Regime.105\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 622, citing **R-0105**, RD 1614/2010, Preamble.\n\nResp.

THE DISPUTED MEASURES**\n----------------------------\n\n135.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2014, Spain enacted what the Claimant characterizes as the \u2018Disputed Measures,\u2019 which, the Claimant argues, drastically overhauled the Special Regime, in breach of Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT.107\n\nCl.

The Parties disagree as to the characterization of the TVPEE. Spain sees it as a domestic taxation measure, within the meaning of Article 21 of the ECT, of general application to both ordinary and RE producers with the purpose of raising state revenue.109 The Claimant sees it as a disguised tariff cut particularly affecting RE producers, and argues that it was not a *bona fide* tax.110\n\n**C-0012**, Law 15/2012, of 27 December 2012.\n\nResp.

Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 150-166.\n\n137.\n\nLaw 15/2012 permitted ordinary energy producers to set their own prices when selling energy to the pool market, enabling them to pass the cost of the 7% tax to the buyers (consumers). But Law 15/2012 required RE producers to sell to the pool at a price of zero and then to receive remuneration through a regulated formula, based on the average market price and a regulated tariff. Under such a formula, the regulated tariff decreases as the average pool market price increases, that is, the remuneration to RE producers does not increase if the average pool price increases.111\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 128, referring to **C-0019**, Electricity Market Operating Rules, 9 May 2014, Art. 39.4.4.\n\n**(2) RD-Law 2/2013**\n---------------------\n\n138.\n\nIn February 2013, Spain enacted RD-Law 2/2013112 eliminating the payment of premiums and leaving RE producers only with the option of a regulated tariff. RD-Law 2/2013 also introduced an adjusted CPI before tax, which did not account for tax increases or the cost of energy products and food prices.113 Spain contends that the methodological changes introduced by RD-Law 2/2013 were aimed at avoiding distortions in the CPI unrelated to the economy and were endorsed by the rules and criteria of the EU.114\n\n**C-0014**, Royal Decree-Law 2/2013, of 1 February 2013.\n\nCl.

This remuneration system would be revised every 6 years. RD-Law 9/2013 modified Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997, to regulate the compensation for an \u2018efficient and well-managed company\u2019 to obtain a \u2018reasonable profitability.\u2019116\n\n**C-0015**, Royal Decree-Law 9/2013, of 12 July 2013.\n\nCl.

The Claimant argues that by repealing the legal framework under which all RE installations were operating and eliminating the two-tiered system, the Special Regime was abolished.118\n\n**C-0016**, Law 24/2013 of 26 December 2013.\n\nCl.

Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 implemented that methodology by setting out multivariable parameters to calculate the levels of financial support for RE production.120 The pre-tax target return referred to above was set at 7.398% for the first six years of the New Regime.121\n\n**C-0017**, Royal Decree 413/2014, of 6 June 2014.\n\n**C-0018**, Spanish Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism Order IET/1045/2014, of 16 June 2014.

THE DISPUTED MEASURES AND SPANISH COURTS DECISIONS**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nFrom 2005 onwards, the Spanish Supreme Court issued a number of decisions on appeals brought against various royal decrees that modified features of the Special Regime. Spain submits that the Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the Spanish legal system and no diligent investor could ignore its case-law.126 In its submissions, Spain frequently relied, *inter alia*, on:\n\n\u2022 Judgment of 15 December 2005,127 rejecting an appeal brought by an association of RE producers against RD 436/2004, for not providing an updating mechanism for the Fixed Tariff. The Court held that there were no legal obstacles for the Government, in the exercise of its regulatory power, to modify the compensation system, provided that it remained within the framework set out in Law 54/1997.\n\n\u2022 Judgment of 25 October 2006,128 rejecting an appeal brought against amendments made by RD 2351/2004 to RD 436/2004 which changed the system for calculating the Special Regime premiums. The Court rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the changes violated their legitimate expectations and confirmed that Special Regime scheme seeks to encourage the use of RE through incentives and cannot be guaranteed to remain unchanged in the future.\n\n\u2022 Judgment of 20 March 2007,129 rejecting an appeal brought against further amendments made to RD 436/2004. The Court noted that the appellants were invoking against RD 2351/2004 the same grounds rejected by its 2006 Judgment. The Court confirmed that Special Regime producers are not guaranteed the intangibility of a given benefit or income regime in relation to those obtained in the past, nor are they guaranteed the indefinite permanence of the formulas used to fix premiums.\n\n\u2022 Judgment of 3 December 2009,130 the Court rejected an appeal brought by photovoltaic energy producers against RD 661/2007. They sought to annul the first transitory provision of RD 661/2007 that excluded them from the possibility of receiving a remuneration pursuant to the pool price plus premium. The producers argued, *inter alia*, that such exclusion violated the alleged guarantee of non-retroactivity set out in Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004. The Court held that neither the freezing of the Special Regime remuneration system nor a right to the immutability of such system follows from Law 54/1997.\n\n\u2022 Judgment No. 270/2015 of the Spanish Constitutional Court and Decision No. 1260/2016 of the Supreme Court (Contentious-Administrative Division)131 which elaborated on the specific issue of the retrospectivity of the Disputed Measures, both concluding that the Disputed Measures did not infringe Article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution prohibiting retroactivity.\n\nResp.

THE PARTIES\u2019 CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s request for relief is formulated in its Reply as follows:\n\n431. Eurus seeks the following relief:\n\n(a) a declaration that Spain has breached the ECT;\n\n(b) a declaration that each such breach by Spain has caused harm to Eurus by diminishing the value of its wind power investment in Spain\u2019s territory;\n\n(c) an award of damages (including appropriate interest and gross-up for taxes) to compensate Eurus for the loss it has suffered as a result of Spain\u2019s breaches of the ECT;\n\n(d) an award of its costs of the arbitration, on a full indemnity basis;\n\n(e) an award of interest on sums awarded up to the date of payment; and\n\n(f) such other relief as the Tribunal determines to be appropriate.\n\n432. Eurus reserves the right to amend and/or supplement the relief sought. Eurus also reserves the right to apply for interim or interlocutory relief should it consider such action necessary.132\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 431, 432.\n\n145.\n\nThe Respondent, in turn, requests in its Rejoinder:\n\n896. In view of the arguments set forth in this Memorial, the Kingdom of Spain respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to:\n\na) Declare that there is no jurisdiction to hear the complaints of the Claimant or, where appropriate, the inadmissibility thereof, in accordance with what is stated in section III of this Memorial, related to Preliminary Objections;\n\nb) In the alternative, in the event that the Arbitral Tribunal decides that it does have jurisdiction to hear the present dispute, that it dismiss all the Claimant\u2019s claims on the merits, due to the fact that the Kingdom of Spain has not breached in any way the ECT, in accordance with what is stated in sections IV and V of this Memorial, referring to the Facts and the Merits of the Case, respectively;\n\nc) Furthermore, all claims for compensation of the Claimant should be dismissed as they are not entitled to compensation in accordance with section VI of this Memorial; and\n\nd) Orders the Claimant to pay all costs and expenses derived from this arbitration, including ICSID administrative expenses, arbitrators\u2019 fees, and the fees of the legal representatives of the Kingdom of Spain, their experts and advisors, as well as any other cost or expense that has been incurred, all of this including a reasonable interest rate from the date on which those costs are incurred and the date of their actual payment.\n\n897. The Kingdom of Spain reserves the right to supplement, modify or add to these claims and to present any additional arguments required under the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Procedural Orders and the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s directives in order to respond to all claims made by the Claimant with regard to this matter.133\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 896, 897.\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal has described, in paragraph 3, 28-36 above, the circumstances which led to the withdrawal of Eurus Europe from this arbitration. Its withdrawal did not affect Eurus Japan\u2019s prayer for relief, which encompasses the claims listed in paragraph 144 above.\n\n147.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Spain raised several jurisdictional objections, as reflected in its prayer for relief reproduced in paragraph 145 above. In particular, Spain argued that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Eurus Europe, which as a Dutch national is not a national of another ECT Contracting Party within the meaning of Article 26(1) of the ECT. Alternatively, Eurus Europe is not an investor protected by the ECT, since the Netherlands and Spain are member states of the European Union and the ECT does not apply to intra-EU investment disputes.134\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 58-101.\n\n148.\n\nIn its written pleadings, Spain did not present this as an objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the claims brought by Eurus Japan. There remain, however, other objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and to the admissibility of certain claims: these are dealt with in Part V of this Award. In addition, in its closing submissions Spain raised for the first time objections related to the Tribunal\u2019s competence over claims brought by Eurus Japan, specifically \u2018that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione materiae*\u2019 over Eurus Japan\u2019s claim135 in light of the decision of the CJEU in the *Achmea* case.\n\nHearing Day 5, p. 119, ll 7-22 (Ms. Moraleda Saceda). The Claimant objected \u2018insofar as there is any jurisdictional objection\u2019 (ibid, p. 126, ll 7-8 (Mr. Turner)).\n\n149.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 respective positions on the matters at issue in the arbitration are summarized in the Parts that follow. The Tribunal has considered the full extent of the Parties\u2019 arguments in both their written and oral submissions. The fact that a given argument is not referred to expressly in the summary of the Parties\u2019 positions should not be considered as an indication that the Tribunal has not considered the argument.\n\n150.\n\nAs a general matter, it is well-known that the issues facing the Tribunal have been or are being dealt with in more than 40 completed or pending arbitration cases against Spain under the ECT, as well as in a variety of other cases concerning renewable energy incentives brought against other states under the ECT or bilateral investment treaties. The Parties have relied on many of the awards and decisions issued by the tribunals in those cases, asking this Tribunal to adopt or depart from their conclusions. This presents a question of principle as to how these diverse (and partly inconsistent) decisions are to be treated. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it should have careful regard to relevant awards and decisions duly presented to it, but it is bound to make up its own mind based on the arguments of the Parties and its own analysis of the facts and the applicable law. This conclusion is to some extent qualified by the fact that the Spanish cases have mostly concerned the same measures and similar, if not identical, issues. Where tribunals have taken a consistent position, the Tribunal should pay particular attention to that position and the reasoning supporting it.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility raised in the course of the proceedings.\n\n152.\n\nIn this context, it is necessary to make a preliminary point as to the arguments raised (or not raised or not maintained) by Spain, a number of which arguably relate to issues of European public order (*ordre public*). Spain, having argued in its written pleadings that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the intra-EU claim maintained by Eurus Europe, did not make any such argument in relation to Eurus Japan. It accepted that Eurus Japan\u2019s investments were lawfully made, and implicitly that Eurus Japan was and is an investor as defined in Article 1(6) of the ECT. It did not take any jurisdictional point as to its initial failure to notify the Special Regime under European state aid rules, despite the fact that this failure may have resulted in the subsidies granted to the SPCs having adverse consequences under European law. Nor did Spain present any expert evidence on the European law of state aid, despite the fact that this has been done in certain cases involving the Disputed Measures.\n\n153.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, EU member states that are parties to ECT proceedings (or indeed BIT proceedings generally) remain *sui juris*. Accordingly, they have the normal capacities that a state party has in an arbitration, including the capacity to formulate its case and to take steps in the proceeding.136 The legal consequences of such choices of litigation strategy are a matter for the Tribunal to appreciate in the course of its award, applying the standards of international law.\n\nIn *Antaris*, the tribunal refused an application to admit the CJEU\u2019s decision in *Achmea* on the ground that it was \u2018too late, since [\u2026] [Respondent] had waived any objection on the EU jurisdictional point\u2019. **CL-0115**, *Antaris*, \u00b6 73.\n\n**A. FIRST OBJECTION: THE TVPEE IS A TAXATION MEASURE WHICH IS EXEMPT FROM THESCOPE OF THE ECT BY REASON OF ARTICLE 21(1) OF THE ECT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent breached its obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT by introducing, by means of Law 15/2012, a 7% tax on the value of electric energy production (the TVPEE). The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to determine that claim because the TVPEE is a taxation measure exempt from the scope of the ECT by reason of the carve-out of Article 21(1) of the ECT.137\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 113-223.\n\n**(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent\u2019s position***\n----------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it has not consented to arbitrate disputes deriving from tax measures such as the TVPEE. Under Article 26(3) of the ECT, Spain only consented to arbitrate disputes arising out of alleged breaches of Part III of the ECT. While Article 10(1) of the ECT is included in Part III, the TVPEE \u2013 the introduction of which allegedly breaches Spain\u2019s obligations under Article 10(1) \u2013 is a taxation measure. Taxation measures are exempt from the scope of protection of Article 10(1) by virtue of Article 21(1) of the ECT, which provides that \u2018nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties.\u2019 Article 21(5) reapplies Article 13 to taxation measures, subject to a process of preliminary referral to \u2018the relevant Competent Tax Authority\u2019, a matter to which the Tribunal will return. But Article 10(1) is not reapplied.\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the TVPEE is a \u2018Taxation Measure\u2019 as defined by Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT. In accordance with this definition, the TVPEE is a domestic law of Spain, enacted by the Spanish Parliament in accordance with the relevant procedures under Spanish law,138 and is recognized as a tax under Spanish and international law.139\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 110.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 111-116.\n\n157.\n\nSpain also submits, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s argument,140 that the TVPEE is a *bona fide* taxation measure. According to Spain, the TPVEE is a tax applying generally to both renewable and conventional energy producers, which are granted the same treatment without according tax benefits to renewable energy procedures not accorded to others.141 In November 2014, the Constitutional Court of Spain confirmed the legislator\u2019s right to enact the TVPEE, dismissing the appeal brought by the Government of Andalusia against the alleged unconstitutionality of Law 15/2012.142\n\nCl.

Russia* and *Yukos v. Russia*,143 on which the Claimant relies to illustrate non- *bona fide* taxes.144 The taxation measures imposed in those cases pursued a purpose entirely unrelated to that of obtaining revenue for the state.145\n\n**RL-0077** or **CL-0004** or **CL-0081**, *Hulley Enterprises Limited (Cyprus) v.

The revenues from the TVPEE are accounted for in Spain\u2019s annual General Budget; it is not a disguised tariff cut targeting producers of renewable energy.146 In fact, the economic effects of the TVPEE on producers of renewable energy are neutralized. Spain notes that RE producers are entitled to receive the specific remuneration to recover the costs of the TVPEE, because under Order IET/1045/2014, the TPVEE is among the operating costs considered to calculate the specific remuneration that they receive.147\n\nResp.

The Claimant\u2019s position***\n--------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the carve-out of Article 21(1) of the ECT only applies to taxation measures that are *bona fide*, *i.e.* not actions disguised as a tax but aiming at achieving a different purpose.151 The Claimant views the TVPEE established by Law 15/2012 not as a *bona fide* tax, but as a disguised requirement that RE producers reimburse Spain for a portion of their pecuniary incentives.152\n\nCl.

The Claimant also refers to statements of members of the Spanish Parliament when Law 15/2012 was debated, that the tax did not comply with the objective of more efficient use and respect for the environment and energy sustainability.154\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 153, 154.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 154.\n\n163.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that even the Spanish Supreme Court had doubts about the constitutionality of the tax and its stated environmental purpose, because renewable energy producers are already subject to a trade tax on their economic capacity. The Claimant explains that the Spanish Constitutional Court rejected the Supreme Court\u2019s question about the constitutionality of the TVPEE, on the ground that the question should have been posed to the CJEU, but did not rule on the substance of the question.155 The doubts of the Spanish Supreme Court bolster the inference that the TVPEE was introduced with an ulterior purpose.156\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 53.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 157-161.\n\n164.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant explains that RE producers are prevented from passing the cost of the TVPEE on to consumers, because RE producers cannot determine the price of their product; they have to accept a regulated premium.157 This discriminatory effect was reflected, among others, in the discussions in the Spanish parliament preceding the adoption of Law 15/2012 and in statements by Spain\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Tourism saying that Spain could have opted to reduce premiums, but instead chose to adopt a tax.158\n\nCl.

Russia* and *Yukos v. Russia* are not present here. The Claimant maintains its position that the TVPEE of Law 15/2012 was introduced with the purpose of reducing incentives to RE producers and was shaped as a tax to avoid liability under the ECT, which is a purpose entirely unrelated to that of raising revenue for Spain, as in *Yukos*.159\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 54.\n\n166.\n\nThe fact that the TVPEE is of general application arguably misses the point. Most of the Claimant\u2019s wind plants have been unable to offset the TVPEE, since they have obtained returns above 7.398% and thus are not eligible to receive specific remuneration under the New Regime. For this reason, Spain\u2019s explanation that the TVPEE is one of the costs that RE producers, including Claimant, are allowed to offset is not relevant here.160\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 56.

Spain*, the tribunal considered that Spain\u2019s adoption of Law 15/2012, although misleading, did not rise to the level of Russia\u2019s conduct in the adoption of taxation measures in the cases *Yukos* and *RosInvest*. The ruling in *Isolux v. Spain* arguably failed to appreciate the connection between Spain\u2019s use of a tax to reduce incentives and the fact that Spain was facing the first claims under the ECT*.*161\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 164.\n\n168.\n\nEurus Japan is in a different position compared to the claimants in *Eiser v. Spain* in respect of Law 15/2012*.* In *Eiser v. Spain*, the tribunal reasoned that any damages flowing from the TVPEE would be reduced, if not eliminated, by Spain\u2019s inclusion of the TVPEE among the costs compensable to CSP operators subject to the new regime that replaced RD 661/2007.162 Here, all but two of the Claimant\u2019s wind farms have received no incentives over the pool price, with the effect that the Claimant has not been able to recover the cost of the TVPEE through such incentives. If the TVPEE is found to be in breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT, the Claimant\u2019s damages would be substantial.163\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 165, citing **CL-0079**, *Eiser*, \u00b6 272.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 162-166.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nIn agreement with all other tribunals which have faced this issue, the Tribunal holds that the TVPEE is a taxation measure excluded from its jurisdiction under Article 10(1) of the ECT by reason of the carve-out in Article 21(1) of the ECT, which provides:\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.164\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 21(1).\n\n170.\n\nThe ECT does not define the term \u2018taxation measure\u2019, although Article 21(7)(a) includes within the scope of this term \u2018any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein\u2019 as well as \u2018any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.\u2019165\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 21(7)(a).\n\n171.\n\nTo interpret Article 21, the Tribunal will apply the general rule of treaty interpretation as found in Article 31(1) of the VCLT, which provides that \u2018[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\u2019\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the term \u2018taxation measure\u2019 should be given its ordinary meaning in the context of the treaty. According to the interpretation of the term \u2018taxation measures\u2019 in *EnCana v. Ecuador* :\n\nThe question whether something is a tax measure is primarily a question of its legal operation, not its economic effect. A taxation law is one which imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes. The economic impacts or effects of tax measures may be unclear and debatable; nonetheless a measure is a taxation measure if it is part of the regime for the imposition of a tax. A measure providing relief from taxation is a taxation measure just as much as a measure imposing the tax in the first place.166\n\n**CL-0005**, *EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador* (UNCITRAL), Award, 3 February 2006 (\u2018***EnCana v. Ecuador***\u2019), \u00b6 142.\n\n173.\n\nFurthermore, for a taxation measure to fall within the scope of Article 21(1) of the ECT, it must have been enacted in good faith. This is not to say that bad faith in the state\u2019s exercise of its taxing powers is to be presumed. For a taxation measure to have been enacted in bad faith, the Claimant needs to establish that the disputed measures were taken for ulterior, improper motives under the guise of taxation and therefore in bad faith. This additional *bona fides* test was applied by the tribunals in *Yukos v. Russia* and *Hulley v. Russia*. In *Yukos v. Russia*, the tribunal found that:\n\n[T]he carve-out of Article 21(1) can apply only to *bona fide* taxation actions, *i.e.*, actions that are motivated by the purpose of raising general revenue for the State. By contrast, actions that are taken only under the guise of taxation, but in reality aim to achieve an entirely unrelated purpose (such as the destruction of a company or the elimination of a political opponent) cannot qualify for exemption from the protection standards of the ECT under the taxation carve-out in Article 21(1).167\n\n**RL-0078**, *Yukos*, \u00b6 1407.\n\n174.\n\nThe *Yukos* tribunal, like the tribunal in *Hulley*, distinguished between *bona fide* taxation measures and measures aimed at unrelated purposes such as destroying a company or a political opponent.168\n\n**RL-0078**, *Yukos*, \u00b6 1407; **CL-0081**, *Hulley*, \u00b6 1407.\n\n175.\n\n*Prima facie*, the TVPEE is a tax. First, the Claimant concedes that it has all the formal attributes of a tax.169 Second, it was upheld as such by the Spanish courts. The Respondent enumerates various decisions of the Spanish High Court relating to Ministerial Order HAP/703/2013 of April 2013.170 This Order approved Form 583 by which taxpayers self-assess and pay the TVPEE to the Spanish Treasury. The High Court declared the Order lawful.171 The Respondent also points to a decision of the Constitutional Court of 6 November 2014,172 which dismissed a claim that Articles 4, 5 and 8 of the TVPEE were unconstitutional.173 The Court ruled that \u2018the challenged provisions do not exceed the freedom of configuration of the legislator, who is in no way prevented from employing taxation [\u2026]\u2019174 and referred to the TVPEE as \u2018the tax in question\u2019.175 As to the second limb of the definition of the term \u2018taxation measure\u2019, namely whether the TVPEE constitutes a compulsory exaction of money by law for public purposes, the Tribunal agrees with the conclusion in *Isolux v. Spain*.176 The TVPEE was collected by the Spanish state and was compulsory for all producers of electric energy for the purpose of raising funds for the state. The objective of Law 15/2012 was to harmonize Spain\u2019s tax system with a usage that is more efficient and respectful of the environment and sustainability.177 On its face, the TVPEE constitutes a compulsory exaction of money by law for public purposes.178\n\nCl.

Reply, \u00b6 149.\n\n176.\n\nAs to the *bona fides* requirement, the Tribunal is not confronted with a scenario similar to the one in *Yukos* or *Hulley*. There is no evidence that Spain intended to destroy the Claimant by means of the TVPEE. As stated by the tribunal in *Isolux v. Spain*, the \u2018economic repercussions or effects of the [T]VPEE may be obscure and debatable, but that does not constitute a sufficient argument to conclude that the [T]VPEE is a tax measure that was promulgated in bad faith.\u2019179\n\n**RL-0024**, *Isolux*, \u00b6 739.\n\n177.\n\nIn *Eiser*, the tribunal did not decide whether there is a bad faith exception to Article 21(1):180 it held that the bad faith allegation \u2018could be maintained only if Spain knew or should have known that the RD 661/2007 tariffs cannot be substantially altered, and so knowingly violated its obligations under the ECT by adopting Law 15/2012. The evidence is not sufficient to sustain this contention.\u2019181 Without expressing an opinion on the criterion adopted in *Eiser v. Spain* for a bad faith allegation to be sustainable, the Tribunal considers that, in the present case, the Claimant has failed to establish circumstances indicating that the TVPEE was adopted in bad faith.\n\n**CL-0079**, *Eiser*, \u00b6 269.\n\nIbid.\n\n178.\n\nIn *Antaris*, the tribunal held that a levy chargeable only to the recipients of subsidies and collected by way of an offset against subsidy entitlements was not a tax. The decision on that point is distinguishable *inter alia* on the basis that the Czech Supreme Administrative Court had found that the \u2018Solar Levy is not a tax for purposes of the prohibition against double taxation under Czech law\u2019.182 The avowed purpose of the levy was to reduce the feed-in tariffs for certain investors and not to raise revenue for the state budget.183\n\n**CL-0115**, *Antaris*, \u00b6\u00b6 233, 238.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 250ff.\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimant alleges (paragraph 161 above) that the TVPEE applies unequally to its SPCs because all but two of them are unable to claim back amounts of tax paid because they are ineligible for subsidies. This allegedly unequal incidence of the TVPEE does not, by itself, constitute evidence of bad faith. Nor does any such unequal incidence change the character of the TVPEE as a tax. A tax does not cease to be a tax because it applies unequally or disproportionately to particular taxpayers or categories of taxpayers, and no such equality or proportionality of incidence is required by the ECT for a measure to qualify as a taxation measure. If the TVPEE is a tax measure for the purposes of ECT Article 21(1), Article 10(1) simply does not apply to it.\n\n180.\n\nFor these reasons, the TVPEE constitutes a taxation measure for the purposes of Article 21(1) of the ECT and the claim falls outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction insofar as it involves an alleged breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n**B. SECOND OBJECTION: THE TRIBUNAL LACKS JURISDICTION TO DECIDE ON EURUS\u2019SGROSS-UP CLAIM IN RELATION TO JAPANESE TAXATION OF THE AWARD UNDER ARTICLE 21(1) OF THE ECT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimant contends that its compensation must comprise a tax gross-up to offset the taxes to which the amounts potentially awarded to the Claimant may be subject in Japan in order to receive full compensation.184 The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimant\u2019s claim as a result of the tax carve-out of Article 21.185\n\nCl.

The question whether the gross-up claim is excluded from the protections afforded by the ECT by reason of the carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT is, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, a question about the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to adjudicate the gross-up claim, rather than about the admissibility of the claim.\n\n182.\n\nThe Parties argued the issue of the exclusion of the gross-up claim from the scope of the protections of the ECT as a matter of quantum.186 However, the question of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the gross-up claim can be addressed already at this stage.\n\nResp.

The Respondent\u2019s position***\n----------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it has not consented to submit to arbitration the resolution of disputes deriving from tax measures and that the tax carve-out contained in Article 21(1) of the ECT applies.187\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 1160.\n\n184.\n\nSpain maintains that the carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT excludes from the scope of the ECT taxation measures implemented in the investor\u2019s host and home state, in so far as both are \u2018Contracting Parties\u2019 to the ECT.188\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 1162; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 862.\n\n185.\n\nFurther, no tax measure in another state can create an obligation for Spain on the basis of the ECT, considering that in the event of inconsistencies, the tax carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT prevails over any other provision of the ECT, including Articles 10, 13 and 26 of the ECT, as provided by the second sentence of Article 21 of the ECT.189\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 1163; Repl. Rej., \u00b6 863.\n\n186.\n\nSpain argues that its position is consistent with Article 2 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, whereby a state\u2019s conduct is an internationally wrongful act giving rise to international responsibility if it is \u2018attributable to the State under international law\u2019 and if it constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that state.190 This position is arguably also consistent with the decision of the tribunal in *Rusoro v. Venezuela*, according to which tax liability derived from tax laws of a country other than the investor\u2019s host country is not a consequential loss arising from the host country\u2019s breach of the treaty and does not engage the home country\u2019s liability.191 Therefore, Spain cannot be held liable to pay for tax measures implemented by Japan for which Spain is not responsible.192\n\nResp.

The Claimant\u2019s position***\n--------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that, under the principle of full reparation, it is entitled to be compensated for the sum of \u2018Historical Damages\u2019, \u2018Lost Value Damages\u2019, compound interest on those two amounts of damages193 and, if necessary, a tax gross-up to off-set the taxes to which the amounts potentially awarded to the Claimant may be subject in Japan.194\n\nCl.

First, the carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT does not apply to a tax gross-up. Instead, the carve-out aims at maintaining each Contracting State\u2019s sovereign taxation powers. If the tax gross-up were granted, the Tribunal would not be imposing obligations on Spain with respect to Japanese measures, nor creating rights in favour of the Claimant with respect to Spanish taxation measures; the Tribunal would be awarding additional damages to cover the tax that the Claimant will be required to pay.196\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 1165.\n\n190.\n\nThird, the reasoning of the tribunal in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* was based on the principle of full compensation, requiring that any tax applied in any country (not just the investor\u2019s home country) on the proceeds of the award, that should not have been paid in the absence of a state\u2019s breach, be compensated by the state.199\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 378.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nEurus seeks higher damages on the basis that it will lose part of the value of the award in Japanese tax. The Respondent argues that the claim is inadmissible by reason of the tax carve-out of Article 21(1) of the ECT.200\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 850, 858-862.\n\n192.\n\nYet Article 21(1) is not applicable in terms. Article 21(1) excludes from the jurisdiction of the Tribunal claims relating to a breach of a provision of the ECT that creates rights or imposes obligations through a taxation measure.\n\n193.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s claim, however, would not \u2018create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties\u2019, as stated in Article 21(1) of the ECT. This is because the claim is not with regard to a right or an obligation that stems from the ECT. It constitutes solely a claim for full reparation under international law.\n\n194.\n\nSpain\u2019s only obligation, if it is held to be responsible, is to pay compensation in accordance with international law. The claim concerns the quantum of that obligation. This leaves the taxation measures of the Contracting Parties exactly as they were.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction to hear the claim.\n\n**C. THIRD OBJECTION: INADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIM FOR EXPROPRIATION UNDERARTICLE 13 OF THE ECT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nArticle 21 of the ECT provides:\n\n(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes.\n\n(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent it pertains to whether a tax constitutes an expropriation or whether a tax alleged to constitute an expropriation is discriminatory, the following provisions shall apply:\n\n(i) The Investor or the Contracting Party alleging expropriation shall refer the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation or whether the tax is discriminatory to the relevant Competent Tax Authority. Failing such referral by the Investor or the Contracting Party, bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) shall make a referral to the relevant Competent Tax Authorities;\n\n(ii) The Competent Tax Authorities shall, within a period of six months of such referral, strive to resolve the issues so referred. Where non-discrimination issues are concerned, the Competent Tax Authorities shall apply the non-discrimination provisions of the relevant tax convention or, if there is no non-discrimination provision in the relevant tax convention applicable to the tax or no such tax convention is in force between the Contracting Parties concerned, they shall apply the non-discrimination principles under the Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development;\n\n(iii) Bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) may take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is an expropriation. Such bodies shall take into account any conclusions arrived at within the six-month period prescribed in subparagraph (b)(ii) by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is discriminatory.

The Respondent\u2019s position***\n----------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the claim under Article 13 of the ECT for alleged expropriation of Eurus Japan\u2019s investment by reason of the TVPEE is inadmissible, because the Claimant failed to refer to the competent national tax authority the issue whether the TVPEE tax constitutes an expropriation or is discriminatory.201\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 224-242; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 167-179.\n\n198.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent maintains, the carve-out for taxation measures effected by Article 21 of the ECT does not apply to expropriation claims under Article 13.202 (Article 13 does not contain a free-standing prohibition of discrimination, although discrimination is one of the indicia of an expropriatory tax measure.) Article 21(5)(b)(i) of the ECT sets out a procedure which must be followed whenever an issue arises under Article 13.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 228.\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the words of the provision \u2018shall refer\u2019 indicate that the procedure of Article 21(5)(b)(i) is mandatory. The Respondent acknowledges that the claimant in *Isolux v. Spain* already referred the issue to the competent authority, which determined that the tax was neither expropriatory nor discriminatory,203 but argues that both the referral and the determination in that case are irrelevant, since a referral must be made on each occasion.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 169-173.\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that, given that the Claimant continues to be in breach of its obligation to refer the issue, the Tribunal should declare the Article 13 claim inadmissible in relation to the TVPEE and refer the issue to the competent tax authorities, pursuant to Article 21(5)(b)(i) of the ECT.204\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 243; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 179.\n\n***b. The Claimant\u2019s position***\n--------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the requirement under Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT, to refer the issue to the competent tax authority, does not apply when referral would be futile.205 The claimant in *Isolux v. Spain* referred the issue whether the TVPEE under Law 15/2012 was expropriatory and/or discriminatory to the Spanish Tax Department, the competent tax authority in that case.206 On 29 March 2016, the Spanish Tax Department reported that the TVPEE was neither expropriatory nor discriminatory, citing in support the judgment of the Spanish Constitutional Court of 6 November 2014. Also, on 23 December 2014, the Spanish General Directorate of Taxation issued a written answer to a tax consultation, saying that the 7% tax of Law 15/2012 is a tax deductible accounting expense, a statement which the General Directorate of Taxation would not have made had it regarded the 7% tax as expropriatory or discriminatory.207 By the time the Claimant submitted its Request for Arbitration on 17 February 2016, the position of the competent authority was clear, and would have made a referral by the Claimant futile.208\n\nCl.

Reply, \u00b6 173.\n\n202.\n\nFurther, the Claimant argues that Article 21(5) of the ECT does not set a precondition for the Claimant\u2019s resort to arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT. The sole consequence of non-compliance with Article 21(5) is that the bodies called upon to settle the dispute under Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) (in the present case, this Tribunal) shall make the referral.209\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 59.\n\n203.\n\nFinally, the Claimant contends that the use of the singular \u2018Authority\u2019 in Article 21(5)(b)(i) was deliberate. The Tribunal already has the benefit of the conclusions of the Spanish authority, without needing further referral, and may assign them whatever weight it deems appropriate.210\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 61, 63.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nThe first point to make is that Article 21(5), which is carefully drafted, does not say that failure by a claimant to notify the competent tax authority renders a claim inadmissible. The sole consequence of such failure is that the tribunal hearing the claim is called on to notify the competent tax authorities itself. The sole further consequence of such a referral (provided the competent tax authorities can agree that the tax measure is expropriatory or discriminatory) is that the tribunal should take any such agreement into account. If the Article 13 claim were inadmissible by reason of the claimant\u2019s failure to notify the competent tax authority, there would be no point in the tribunal doing so, because the claim would already be barred. Hence a claimant\u2019s failure to act is not in itself a ground of inadmissibility.\n\n205.\n\nNor will this Tribunal of its own motion notify the competent tax authorities, since it already knows the position of the competent Spanish authority, which, consistent with the decision of the Constitutional Court of 4 November 2014 already referred to, is that the TVPEE is neither expropriatory or discriminatory.211 This fact, which is relevant not to admissibility but to the merits, will be taken into account in due course. For the Tribunal to make a reference itself would be the purest formalism and a waste of time. The Article 13 claim is admissible.\n\n**RL-0043**, Judgment 183/2014, 6 November 2014, published in the BOE of 4 December 2014.\n\n**D. PUTATIVE OBJECTION: STATUS OF THE CLAIMANT AS AN INVESTOR FOR THE PURPOSESOF ARTICLE 26(1) OF THE ECT AND RELATED ISSUES**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nUnder Article 26 of the ECT, if an investor is a party to a dispute \u2018relating to an Investment [\u2026], which concern[s] an alleged breach of an obligation of the [host state] under Part III\u2019, and which cannot be settled amicably within 3 months, the investor may choose to submit the dispute to arbitration under Part V.\n\n207.\n\n\u2018Investment\u2019 is defined as:\n\nevery kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor and includes:\n\n[\u2026] (b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(e) Returns; [\u2026]212\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 1(6).\n\n208.\n\n\u2018Investor\u2019 is defined to mean, *inter alia* :\n\n(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(ii) a company or other organisation organised in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party; [\u2026]213\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 1(7).\n\n209.\n\n\u2018Returns\u2019 are defined to mean:\n\nthe amounts derived from or associated with an Investment, irrespective of the form in which they are paid, including profits, dividends, interest, capital gains, royalty payments, management, technical assistance or other fees and payments in kind.214\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 1(9).\n\n210.\n\nIn accordance with these definitions, Eurus Japan is plainly an indirect investor of Japan in the SPCs, and its investment includes returns which, even if paid through Eurus Europe, are \u2018derived from or associated with an investment\u2019.\n\n211.\n\nAs part of its closing submissions, Spain argued that the Claimant had not proven that any damages suffered at plant level had flowed through to Eurus Japan. In this context, it cited a paragraph in its Counter-Memorial,215 a passage in the cross-examination of Claimant\u2019s quantum witness,216 and the decision in *Nykomb v. Latvia*.217 At no point did the Respondent argue that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Eurus Japan. It did argue, prior to Eurus Europe\u2019s withdrawal as a Claimant, that there was no jurisdiction over Eurus Europe, essentially on the ground that the dispute between Spain and Eurus Europe was an intra-EU dispute to which the ECT did not apply.218 That argument, fortified by the CJEU\u2019s decision in the *Achmea* case, was not put forward by the Respondent at the oral phase, presumably because it had been rendered moot by Eurus Europe\u2019s withdrawal from the arbitration. However, the ghost of the argument remained, as in the following passage:\n\nMS. MORALEDA SACEDA: This dispute concerns EU law from the beginning point to the end one. You cannot decide this dispute without EU law; that\u2019s the problem. And that\u2019s the conflict with the principle of autonomy of EU law, which is a question of public order, acknowledged by the ECT itself.\n\nMR. GARIBALDI: So what are we supposed to do?\n\nMS. MORALEDA SACEDA: Declare that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione materiae*.219\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 1127 (a passing reference to the issue).\n\nHearing Day 5, p. 235, ll 1-5 (Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Antu\u00f1a).\n\nHearing Day 5, p. 235, ll 7-19 (Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Antu\u00f1a), referring at slides 196-198 of Respondent\u2019s Closing Statement to **RL-0057**, *Damages in International Investment Law*, Sergey Ripinsky with Kevin Williams, British Institute of International and Comparative Law (BIICL), 2008 (\u2018**Ripinsky**\u2019), p. 156, citing *Nykomb Synergetics Technology Holding AB v. Republic of Latvia* (SCC Case No. 118/2001), Award, (\u2018***Nykomb v. Latvia***\u2019), 16 December 2004, pp. 39-41. At the Hearing, the Claimant objected to these references as being new material. While noting the objection, the Tribunal admitted the references which were made in response to a question from the Tribunal. See Hearing Day 5, p. 203, ll 24-25 (Mr. Turner), pp. 204, 205, ll 12-21 (The President).\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 57-112; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 58-101.\n\nHearing Day 5, p. 119, ll 7-15 (Ms. Moraleda Saceda).\n\n212.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, jurisdiction (if, and to the extent that, it exists) derives from the ECT, which represents the legal basis for the constitution of the Tribunal. There can be no doubt, as things stand, as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione personae* over Eurus Japan: indeed, Spain, if not expressly then by clear implication, accepted as much.220 Spain never presented the flow-through issue as one which affected jurisdiction; rather it went to quantum, and will be dealt with below in that context.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 57-112 and Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 58-101: Respondent at no point disputed the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione personae* over Eurus Japan. It only contested the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Eurus Europe.\n\n213.\n\nAs to jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, this too is governed by the ECT, and will be dealt with below in the context of the applicable law. It is sufficient to hold here that *Achmea* concerned jurisdiction under an intra-EU bilateral investment treaty, as made clear by the CJEU in the operative part of the judgment:\n\nArticles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.221\n\n*Achmea*, \u00b6 62.\n\n214.\n\n*Achmea* did not concern jurisdiction vis-\u00e0-vis a third-state national under a multilateral treaty to which the EU itself was and remains a party.\n\n215.\n\nTo summarize, the *Achmea* decision is inapplicable to the present case, in so far as it concerns the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the dispute between Eurus Japan as an indirect investor and the Kingdom of Spain.222 It is not necessary therefore for the Tribunal to decide as between subsequent decisions such as *RREEF*,223*Greentech*,224*Cube,225 9REN,226* and *Stadtwerke227* which held *Achmea* inapplicable to intra-EU ECT disputes on different grounds. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is not called into question by the issue of flow-through of damages via Eurus Europe to Eurus Japan, which was presented exclusively as a matter relevant to quantum.\n\nIndeed, in **CL-0118**, *Landesbank*, \u00b6\u00b6 119, 149, Spain and the EC both accepted that the tribunal would have had jurisdiction if the claimant had been Japanese. This point was made by Claimant in its Comments on the *Landesbank* Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 August 2019, \u00b6 3.\n\n**RL-0088**, *RREEF*, \u00b6 211.\n\n**CL-0116**, *Greentech*, \u00b6 220\n\n**RL-0090**, *Cube*, \u00b6\u00b6 141-152\n\n**CL-0117**, *9REN*, \u00b6\u00b6 150-158, 173.\n\n**RL-0097**, *Stadtwerke*, \u00b6 142.\n\n**VI. APPLICABLE LAW**\n----------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nIn the context of its intra-EU objection,228 Spain argued that EU law has a threefold dimension in this case, (i) as international law applicable to the resolution of the dispute under Article 26(6) of the ECT; (ii) as part of Spain\u2019s internal law; and (iii) as a \u2018fundamental point\u2019 shaping Eurus\u2019 legitimate expectations.229\n\nSee Resp. C-Mem, \u00b6\u00b6 58-101. As explained, at paragraph 211 above, the intra-EU objection was rendered moot after Eurus Europe\u2019s withdrawal.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 66.\n\n217.\n\nSpain disagrees with the findings of the *Cube* tribunal, and maintains that \u2018EU law is international law that shall be applied together with the ECT to decide the issues in dispute, both on jurisdiction and on the merits, pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT.\u2019230 Spain submits that the Tribunal is bound by primary (treaties) and secondary (EC directives and decisions) sources of EU law, which are applicable to this case.231\n\nRespondent\u2019s comments on *Cube*, 29 May 2019, \u00b6 8.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on the European Commission\u2019s Application to intervene, 31 January 2019, \u00b6 2.\n\n218.\n\nSpain argues that the \u2018subsidies sought by the Claimant\u2019 are state aid.232 Spain relies on the European Commission\u2019s Decision of 10 November 2017 regarding the Spanish State Aid Framework for Renewable Sources (\u2018**EC decision of 10 November 2017**\u2019)233 to argue that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide whether the Claimant\u2019s wind farms are entitled to a *sine die* right to a specific amount of state aid. Such decision, Spain submits, would distort market competition in the Claimant\u2019s favour, which would amount to a violation of the \u2018essential pillar[s]\u2019 of EU law.234\n\nSpain contends that the Special Regime was State aid subject to the 2008 Community Guidelines on State Aid for the Environmental Protection, later replaced by the 2014-2020 Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy. See Resp. Rej., \u00b6 63, referring to **R-0065**, Community Guidelines on State Aid for the Environmental Protection, (2008/C 82/01) and **R-0066**, Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020 (2014/C 200/01).\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 77, citing **RL-0073**, Decision of the European Commission, of 10 November 2017, regarding the Support for Electricity generation from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste (State Aid S.A. 40348 (2015/NN) (\u2018**EC decision of 10 November 2017**\u2019), \u00b6\u00b6 159-166.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 65.\n\n219.\n\nThe EC decision of 10 November 2017 held that Spain\u2019s current support scheme (*i.e.* the Disputed Measures) is state aid compliant with the internal market (Article 107(3)(c) of the TFEU). Spain argues that the state aid granted until the adoption of the EC decision was unlawful, because the EC had not been notified of it, which was in breach of Spain\u2019s stand-still obligation under Article 108(3) TFEU.235 According to Spain, the EC, following the CJEU\u2019s settled case law, confirmed that under EU law there is no right to state aid; further, there cannot be any legitimate expectations to unlawful State aid.236\n\n**RL-0073**, EC decision of 10 November 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 83-89.\n\n**RL-0073**, EC decision of 10 November 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 155, 158.\n\n220.\n\nSpain submits that the reasons provided by the EC to consider that the subsidies given under the Disputed Measures are State aid can be extended to the subsidies provided under the Special Regime of RD 661/2007.237 Spain argues that, in line with the CJEU\u2019s case law, Eurus cannot have legitimate expectations to unnotified state aid (*i.e.* subsidies under RD 661/2007). Thus, the application of EU law excludes the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations claim.238\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on the European Commission\u2019s Application to intervene, Section III.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on the European Commission\u2019s Application to intervene, Section III.\n\n221.\n\nSpain adds that the EC decision of 10 November 2017 noted that any compensation granted by a tribunal to an investor on the basis that Spain modified the Special Regime by introducing the Disputed Measures would constitute state aid. Tribunals are not competent to authorize state aid, which is an exclusive competence of the EC. Also, any compensation granted would be notifiable state aid.239\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on the European Commission\u2019s Application to intervene, Section III, referring to **RL-0073**, EC decision of 10 November 2017, \u00b6 165.\n\n***b. The Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimant argues that EU law is not applicable to the dispute. Relying on *Eureko v. Slovak Republic*,240 the Claimant submits that, in accordance with Article 26(6) of the ECT, an ECT tribunal can interpret and make determinations as to the meaning of EU law if questions of EU law arise in an ECT dispute. That a tribunal might consider questions of EU law in deciding the dispute does not mean that an arbitration under the auspices of the ECT is to be determined according to a source of law other than the ECT.241 That is, EU law cannot alter or eliminate the protections granted by the ECT. In this regard, the Claimant disagrees with the *BayWa* majority that considered that \u2018[o]nly if and to the extent that the claims made are valid under the ECT do the substantive EU law issues arise.\u2019242 In contrast, the Claimant considers that the Tribunal should take the view of the *Cube* tribunal, that EU law is only one among several regional and national legal systems, and \u2018[w]ithin the system of international law, EU law does not have supremacy, and has no hierarchical priority over the laws of non-Member States, or over rules of international law, including the ECT.\u2019243\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 11, citing **CL-0096**, *Eureko B.V. v. Slovak Republic* (PCA Case No. 2008-13), Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, 26 October 2010 (\u2018***Eureko v.

Eurus is not asking to receive subsidies in perpetuity under the Special Regime (what Spain characterizes as a *sine die* right to state aid). Instead, the Claimant argues that it was entitled under the ECT to fair and equitable treatment, including \u2018stable\u2019 and \u2018favorable\u2019 conditions for its investment. Yet, Spain breached those substantive standards by eliminating through the Disputed Measures rights that Eurus once enjoyed. Eurus claims damages for the harm caused by Spain in accordance with the standard of full reparation under international law. Those damages are measured based on the amounts that Eurus would have received under the Special Regime, because the most plausible counterfactual scenario is one in which Spain did not wrongly eliminate rights in reliance upon which Eurus invested.244\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 12-15.\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the alleged effects of *Achmea* on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction should have been eliminated from this case with Eurus Europe\u2019s withdrawal.245 In any case, Spain\u2019s argument that payments under a potential award in favor of Eurus would constitute state aid and bar jurisdiction fails because (i) Eurus is not asking the re-establishment of the subsidies *per se*, but the remedy due under international law: lump-sum compensation for Spain\u2019s breach of its ECT commitments; and (ii) the EC\u2019s decision of 10 November 2017 covers only the Disputed Measures (*i.e.* the New Regime), it does not declare that the Special Regime constituted unlawful state aid.246 In this regard, the Claimant notes that the tribunal in *Greentech* considered that Spain\u2019s reliance on the EC decision of 10 November 2017 was misplaced, because the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction derives from the ECT, not from EU law.247\n\nClaimant\u2019s comments on *Greentech*, 10 May 2019, \u00b6 4.\n\nCl.

Romania*,249 the Tribunal should not embark on predictions as to the possible conduct of persons or authorities after the issuance of the award, nor is it appropriate for the Tribunal to base its decision on EU law matters that may apply after the award has been rendered.250\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments on the European Commission\u2019s Request to intervene, 31 January 2019, \u00b6 27.\n\n**CL-0023**, *Ioan Micula and others v.

Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 8-18.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nArticle 26(6) of the ECT deals with the applicable law in arbitrations under Part V. It provides that:\n\nA tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\n\n227.\n\nAlso, of potential relevance is Article 16 of the ECT (\u2018Relation to other Agreements\u2019), which provides:\n\nWhere two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of Part III or V of this Treaty,\n\n(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that agreement; and\n\n(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty, *where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n228.\n\nBy clear inference, Parts III and V of the ECT derogate from any provision of some other agreement, or from any right to dispute resolution under that agreement, in so far as the subject matter of the two is common and the ECT provision is more favourable to the investor or the investment.\n\n229.\n\nIn fact, there are no prior or subsequent international agreements between Japan and Spain the terms of which concern the subject matter of Parts III or V of the ECT, so that the rule of priority expressed in the final (italicized) phrase of Article 16 has no application here. But Article 16 remains indirectly relevant as concerns the relation between the ECT and the TFEU, in that by clear implication the ECT prevails over the TFEU to the extent that the ECT provision \u2018is more favourable to the Investor or Investment\u2019. One would not expect a non-EU member state, or the nationals of such a state, to be treated less well.\n\n230.\n\nTo the extent that EU law is part of the applicable law under Article 26(6) of the ECT (*i.e.* if and insofar as EU law constitutes \u2018applicable rules and principles of international law\u2019), this Tribunal is *prima facie* authorized to apply it.\n\n231.\n\nOn this issue, the decisions of earlier tribunals have been markedly inconsistent:\n\n\u2022 *AES Summit*, **CL-0050** : The parties agreed that EU law is to be taken into account as a relevant fact,251 and the tribunal ruled that it would consider the Community competition law regime as a fact.252\n\n\u2022 *Electrabel*, **CL-0018** : The tribunal stated that EU law is to be treated as a \u2018fact\u2019253 and is also to be classified as international law.254 But in intra-EU disputes, \u2018EU law would prevail over the ECT in case of any material inconsistency\u2019.255\n\n\u2022 *Eureko v. Slovak Republic (Jurisdiction)*, **CL-0096** : The tribunal decided that it \u2018can consider and apply EU law, if required, both as a matter of international law and as a matter of German law\u2019.256 It further noted, however, that it \u2018does not have jurisdiction to rule on alleged breaches of EU law as such\u2019.257\n\n\u2022 *Micula*, **CL-0023** : The parties seemed \u2018to agree that EU law forms part of the \"factual matrix\" of the case\u2019 and \u2018that the question of EU law may be relevant to determining whether Romania acted fairly and equitably with respect to the Claimants\u2019 investments [\u2026]\u2019.258 The tribunal concurred as the \u2018overall context of EU accession in general and the pertinent provisions of EU law in particular may be relevant to the determination of whether, *inter alia*, Romania\u2019s actions were reasonable in light of all the circumstances, or whether Claimants\u2019 expectations were legitimate\u2019.259 However, it decided that EU law, and state aid law in particular, was irrelevant to the tribunal and solely a matter for the enforcing court.260\n\n\u2022 *Charanne*, **RL-0049** : The tribunal did not decide on whether the dispute concerned the interpretation or application of the European treaties in the sense of Article 344 TFEU, since it took the view that Article 344 does not apply to investor-state arbitrations.261\n\n\u2022 *RREEF (Jurisdiction)*, **CL-0006**; *RREEF (Merits)*, **RL-0088** : The tribunal observed that public international law prevails in case of conflict between the ECT and EU law. \u2018EU law does not and cannot \"trump\" public international law.\u2019262 The tribunal awarded substantially reduced damages to the claimants solely in relation to the allegedly \u2018retrospective\u2019 aspects of the 2013-14 regime. That aspect of the decision is discussed in more detail below.263\n\n\u2022 *Wirtgen*, **CL-0097** : The tribunal concluded that international law encompasses EU law,264 but it did not find any relevant conflict, thus the issue of primacy did not arise.265 Finally, there was no need to discuss state aid issues since the claims failed on other grounds.266\n\n\u2022 *Novenergia II*, **CL-0112** : The tribunal decided that EU law is not applicable and irrelevant to the determination of the jurisdiction of the tribunal.267\n\n\u2022 *Masdar*, **CL-0113** : The tribunal admitted neither the *Achmea* judgment,268 nor the EC\u2019s decision of 10 November 2017.269\n\n\u2022 *Antin*, **CL-0114** : The tribunal did not admit the *Achmea* judgment,270 noting that EU law is substantively irrelevant to the issue of jurisdiction.271 However, it held that Spain did not properly analyse the impact of EU law on the legitimate expectations of the investor.272\n\n\u2022 *Antaris*, **CL-0115** : The tribunal did not admit the *Achmea* decision on the basis of the Respondent\u2019s earlier waiver of objections on the EU jurisdictional point.273 It did not need to discuss the state aid issue since the application failed on other grounds.\n\n\u2022 *Greentech*, **CL-0116** : The tribunal considered that EU law and the *Achmea* judgment were irrelevant to its decision on jurisdiction, finding Article 26(6) of the ECT applicable to the merits only.274 The majority of the tribunal noted that the EC decision of 10 November 2017 did not assess the RD 661/2007 incentives scheme under which the claimants had invested and hence had no bearing on the claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations of regulatory stability at the time of their investment.275\n\n\u2022 *Cube*, **RL-0090** : The tribunal found that, while EU rules against state aid are part of EU law, they \u2018plainly cannot be \"principles of international law\" within the meaning of Article 26(6) ECT.\u2019276 The tribunal considered Spanish law and EU law relevant only as facts to determine how claimants could expect their investments in Spain to be treated, but did not to apply the provisions on EU law concerning state aid.277\n\n\u2022 *NextEra*, **RL-0091** : The tribunal rejected the intra-EU objection but noted that while the *Achmea* judgment dealt with an intra-EU BIT dispute, the *Achmea* judgment was also discussed in the context of investor-state arbitration under the ECT.278 The tribunal decided that the applicable law was the ECT and any rules of international law relevant to its interpretation and application, adding that it would refer to provisions of Spanish and EU law, if appropriate.279 No reference was made to EU law concerning the merits.\n\n\u2022 *9REN*, **CL-0117** or **RL-0092** : On jurisdiction, the tribunal found that EU law was not materially incompatible with investor-state arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT and the ICSID Convention, while the *Achmea* decision \u2018[did] not extend to the ECT.\u2019280 After upholding jurisdiction, the tribunal considered that it was \u2018within that jurisdiction to consider EU law to the extent necessary for the resolution of the dispute under *international* law.\u2019281 (emphasis in the original)\n\n\u2022 *Landesbank*, **CL-0118** : This decision concerned only Spain\u2019s intra-EU objection. The tribunal concluded that by operation of Article 16 of the ECT, EU law did not prevail over the ECT, as the basis for the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. No issues of state aid were addressed.282\n\n\u2022 *OperaFund*, **RL-0093** : The tribunal considered that the distinction between the applicable substantive law and the law applicable to jurisdiction must be respected. The tribunal concluded that all substantive provisions of the ECT applied and that EU law was not part of the applicable substantive law of that case.283\n\n\u2022 *BayWa*, **RL-0095** : The tribunal considered that \u2018[o]nly if and to the extent that the claims made are valid under the ECT do the substantive EU law issues arise.\u2019284\n\n\u2022 *Stadtwerke*, **RL-0097** : The tribunal considered that EU law did not govern the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction by virtue of Article 26(6) of the ECT. On applicable law, the tribunal considered that Spanish law, as the host State\u2019s national law, was not extraneous to the determination that the tribunal must make in respect of the issues in dispute. The tribunal considered that the issue of claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations could be resolved without an assessment of the national law that created and implemented the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the investment.285\n\n**CL-0050** or **RL-0039**, *AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft. v.

But the EU treaties have established legal regimes for regulating matters such as state aid, which are furthermore directly applicable as part of the law of the member states. To the extent that Japanese or other third-state corporations establish activities in the EU that are regulated by those regimes, they may be affected by them.\n\nTo the same effect *Vattenfall AB v. Federal Republic of Germany* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12), Decision on the *Achmea* Issue, 31 August 2018\u00a0(\"***Vattenfall***\"), \u00b6 146,\u00a0citing **RL-0048**, *Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19), Award, 25 November 2015 (\u2018***Electrabel (Award)***\u2019), \u00b6 4.120: \u2018EU law is international law because it is rooted in international treaties\u2019. The Tribunal notes that while *Vattenfall* is not in the record it is in the public domain and Spain referred to it in its comments on *Cavalum* of 20 October 2020 (see para. 4, fn. 4 referring to the findings of the tribunal in *Cavalum* at \u00b6\u00b6 357 and 358 with respect to EU law as part of international law); the Claimant submitted comments on *Cavalum* in response to Spain on 3 November 2020.\n\n233.\n\nIn oral argument, the Respondent, while accepting that in principle EU law was applicable to the Claimant\u2019s investment, denied that the Tribunal could apply it, referring to the CJEU\u2019s strictures as to the autonomy of that law.287 In particular, the CJEU said that:\n\n[T]he [EU] judicial system [\u2026] has as its keystone the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, which [\u2026] has the object of securing uniform interpretation of EU law, thereby serving to ensure its consistency, its full effect and its autonomy as well as, ultimately, the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties.288\n\nHearing Day 5, p. 119, ll 4-12 (Ms. Moraleda Saceda).\n\n*Achmea*, \u00b6 37.\n\n234.\n\nThe Respondent interpreted this passage as denying ECT tribunals (to which the preliminary ruling procedure is inapplicable) any capacity to have regard to EU law. The Tribunal does not read the CJEU\u2019s judgment in that sense. The core of the CJEU\u2019s reasoning was as follows:\n\n57. It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international agreement providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is respected [\u2026].\n\n58. In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU is provided for by an agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States. Article 8 of the BIT is such as to call into question not only the principle of mutual trust between the Member States but also the preservation of the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties, ensured by the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, and is not therefore compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation referred to in paragraph 34 above.\n\n59. In those circumstances, Article 8 of the BIT has an adverse effect on the autonomy of EU law.289\n\n*Achmea*, \u00b6\u00b6 57-59 (references omitted).\n\n235.\n\nIn the present case, by contrast, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is not established by \u2018an agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States\u2019. It is established by a multilateral treaty to which the EU itself is a party. Moreover, the ECT contains no disconnection clause,290 nor does it contain any provision giving precedence to EU over international law, in particular so far as third states are concerned.291 In the absence of any such provisions, the Tribunal is called on to apply the normal rule of priority of international law by virtue of Article 26(6) of the ECT.292\n\nCf **CL-0083**, *Blusun*, \u00b6 280; and many other decisions of investment tribunals to similar effect.\n\nThe definition of REIO in ECT Art. 1(3) does not have this effect. It is concerned to identify and characterise bodies such as the EU as parties to the ECT and to identify their role and obligations alongside states parties. Art. 1(3) does not incorporate by reference any conflicts rule of EU law giving it priority over international law in certain cases.\n\nCf **CL-0006**, *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two lux S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30), Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 June 2016, \u00b6 87.\n\n236.\n\nReferences to the autonomy of EU law do not entail that an ECT tribunal may not take EU law into account in appropriate circumstances. Autonomy is not the same as invisibility, and ECT tribunals can take note of, and apply, clear and established rules of EU law that are relevant to the facts before them. This does not convert such tribunals into unmonitored organs of the EU, nor does it mean that they can exercise powers expressly conferred on EU organs, such as the various competences of the European Commission in relation to state aid. It is one thing to exercise conferred powers, and another to note the settled legal consequences of facts established in the course of the proceedings, for example, the fact that unnotified state aid gives rise to adverse consequences under Article 108(3) of the TFEU. To that extent, at least, EU law is part of the applicable law under Article 26(6) of the ECT.\n\n**VII. MERITS**\n---------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimant alleges three causes of action arising under the ECT:\n\n(A) indirect expropriation (Article 13);\n\n(B) breach of fair and equitable treatment (Article 10(1), first and second sentences);\n\n(C) breach of the obligation of most constant protection, which refers also to impairment with unreasonable or discriminatory measures (Article 10(1), third sentence).\n\n238.\n\nBefore turning to the merits of these claims, insofar as they fall within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, it is relevant to observe that a large number of parallel claims have been filed against the Respondent arising out of the Spanish measures, producing somewhat discrepant results.\n\n239.\n\nAs a general matter, investment tribunals (like other international tribunals) are not bound by a strict doctrine of precedent but are charged to make their own appreciations based on the evidence and arguments presented to them. In practice, tribunals regularly cite previous, publicly available awards and pay careful attention to them. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, concordant decisions on the interpretation and application of the ECT merit serious consideration, especially if they rise to the level of a *jurisprudence constante*. Where they diverge, a later tribunal has no choice but to form its own view of the relevant law and its application to the facts. This the Tribunal has done.\n\n240.\n\nIn assessing the Claimant\u2019s substantive claims, it is appropriate first to consider these under the ECT before turning to consider the parties\u2019 arguments on EU law.\n\n**A. THE EXPROPRIATION CLAIM: ARTICLE 13(1) OF THE ECT**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant\u2019s position**\n-------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the ECT protects investors from direct and indirect expropriation, unless carried out in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 13(1) of the ECT. The Claimant contends that unlawful expropriation relates to tangible property as well as to rights economically significant to the investor, as supported by the jurisprudence of international tribunals, as in *SPP v. Egypt*,293 and as described in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\u2019s study on Taking of Property.294 In particular, relying on *Goetz v. Burundi* and *Middle East Cement v. Egypt*, the Claimant contends that legal rights arising out of unilateral acts by host states, such as laws or decrees, are protected against unlawful expropriation.295 Further, a state\u2019s intention is irrelevant when assessing whether the measures taken resulted in an indirect expropriation.296\n\nCl.

Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 169-171.\n\n242.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Spain, by adopting the Disputed Measures, in particular, RD-Law 2/2013, expropriated the Claimant\u2019s rights to receive premiums, without providing any compensation for the Claimant\u2019s losses. The Claimant\u2019s rights to receive premiums derived from each of the Claimant\u2019s SPCs having received and maintained under Spanish law the status of Special Producer. Each SPC was entitled to receive, at a minimum, premiums above the pool price for the generation of electricity.297\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 178.\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s entitlement was embodied in official certificates, which have been almost completely devalued through Spain\u2019s removal of the feed-in-tariffs, producing the same effect as if they had been revoked.298 After Spain adopted the Disputed Measures, 11 out of 13 SPCs ceased to receive incentives, although their Special Producer Certificates entitled all of them to do so. The Claimant compares this situation to that of *Middle East Cement v. Egypt*, where the tribunal held that a new law prohibiting the importation of cement, rendering the license to import cement moot, was tantamount to an expropriation.299\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 179-181.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 181, citing **CL-0003**, *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6), Award, 12 April 2002, \u00b6 107.\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that Spain failed to pay any compensation for eliminating the payment of the feed-in tariffs through RD-Law 2/2013. Relying on the Brattle Regulatory Report, the Claimant argues that, instead, Spain actively clawed back remuneration that existing facilities had received under the Special Regime.300\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 184, citing **CE-1**, Brattle First Regulatory Report, 18 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 239.\n\n245.\n\nThe Special Regime had no quantitative limit on the cumulative amount of financial incentives that a RE producer could receive. But then the Disputed Measures set a 7.398% investment return for renewable energy investments, applied not only prospectively but also retrospectively. This means that, if an investor had earned returns exceeding 7.398% in previous years, the Disputed Measures balanced that with reduced returns (to the point, where applicable, of zero subsidies) in the future. That is, existing producers, like the Claimant, must reimburse Spain by means of a set-off for remuneration already received under the Special Regime, and facilities which overall earned returns exceeding 7.398% were ineligible for future incentives.301 This constituted an indirect expropriation of Claimant\u2019s rights.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 185, citing **CE-1**, Brattle First Regulatory Report, 18 November 2016, \u00b6 187.\n\n246.\n\nSpain thereby breached Article 13 of the ECT by failing to pay \u2018prompt, adequate and effective\u2019 compensation, unlawfully expropriating the Claimant\u2019s legal rights as a Special Producer.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s position**\n---------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Respondent argues that no expropriation of rights has occurred, since the rights that the Claimant argues were expropriated do not exist under Spanish law and, therefore, are not part of Claimant\u2019s assets. Further, the Disputed Measures were not retroactive.302\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 949, 950; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 619-638.\n\n248.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the certificates to which the Claimant refers were granted upon registration in the RAIPRE. Such certificates resulted from a mandatory administrative step both for conventional and renewables producers and did not reflect any commitment by Spain to guarantee a certain tariff indefinitely into the future.303\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 684-689.\n\n249.\n\nRegistration was used by Spain to monitor the evolution of the electrical energy produced and used, and the energy transferred into the grid, to verify that the objectives in the Plan to Encourage Renewable Energies in Spain 2000-2010 were met. This view was supported by the tribunal in *Charanne v. Spain*304 and follows from RD 2366/1994, which created the RAIPRE and defined its purpose as gathering statistics and offering information about the contribution of the plants to the electrical system.305\n\nResp.

Such rights have never existed and cannot be acquired rights incorporated within Claimant\u2019s assets protected against expropriation under Article 13 of the ECT.306 This position also finds support in the 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2009 Judgments of the Supreme Court, a report of the CNE, and a ruling of the EC.307\n\nResp.

Relying on *Nations Energy v. Panama*,308 the Respondent maintains that regulations which are applied in the future, but do not affect rights already acquired, are not retroactive from an international law perspective.309 Here, the payment of the new remuneration was deployed to the future, taking into account as a relevant fact payments made before the entry into force of RD-Law 2/2013.310\n\nResp.

Spain*, the Respondent argues that the concept of retroactivity defended by the Claimant implies freezing the regulatory framework with respect to the remuneration throughout the entire lifetime of a facility, which is contrary to the object and purpose of the ECT, which allows adopting macroeconomic control measures, even if investors\u2019 profits are reduced thereby.312\n\nResp.

Article 13 of the ECT, like other expropriation guarantees, is concerned with the protection of property interests, including certain legal rights to money or benefits, from seizure or taking, or with conduct equivalent thereto. It is not intended to protect the wider range of interests associated with the idea of reasonable or legitimate expectations. Such expectations can be frustrated or denied, but they cannot be expropriated.\n\n257.\n\nSecondly, when it comes to conduct tantamount to expropriation (or as formulated in Article 13, conduct having \u2018equivalent effect\u2019), it is necessary to bear in mind that expropriation, direct or indirect, requires substantial deprivation of the asset in question or its value. For example, the tribunal in *AES v. Hungary* observed:\n\nFor an expropriation to occur, it is necessary for the investor to be deprived, in whole or significant part, of the property in or effective control of its investment: or for its investment to be deprived, in whole or significant part, of its value.317\n\n**CL-0050**, *AES v. Hungary*, \u00b6 14.3.1\n\n258.\n\nThere are many other decisions to similar effect.318\n\nSee, e.g., **RL-0049**, *Charanne*, \u00b6 464 (\u2018[F]or a loss of value to be equivalent to an expropriation, it has to be so large that it equals a deprivation of property\u2019); **CL-0112**, *Novenergia II*, \u00b6 727 (\u2018It is uncontroversial in international arbitration that a State measure resulting in a \"substantial deprivation\" of an investment \u2013 that is, when the measure substantially interferes with the control or the economic value of the investment \u2013 constitutes an expropriation.\u2019); **RL-0024**, *Isolux*, \u00b6 839 (\u2018That is to say, the impact to the rights or goods of the investor of the measures, must be of such magnitude that its investment loses all or a significant part of its value, which amounts to a deprivation of its property.\u2019).\n\n259.\n\nFor the purposes of Article 13 of the ECT, it is necessary to ask, first, what rights are identified by the Claimant as having been expropriated. As to this, the Claimant clarified in oral argument that \u2018the claim is for an expropriation of the public law right to the FITs\u2019.319 That public law right was said to arise, in the first place, from the Special Producer Certificates issued to each of the project companies pursuant to their registration in the RAIPRE.320\n\nHearing Day 5, p. 10, ll 24-25 (Mr. Turner).\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 184-191.\n\n260.\n\nThe RAIPRE was created by Article 6 of RD 2366/1994, which provided that:\n\n1. For the purpose of adequately monitoring energy planning, in terms of both installed power and evolution of produced energy and primary energy used, a General Registry of Special Regime Production Facilities is hereby created within the General Energy Agency of the Ministry of Industry and Energy [\u2026].321\n\n**C-0002**, RD 2366/1994, Art. 6.\n\n261.\n\nArticle 7 of RD 2366/1994 then spelled out producers\u2019 rights and obligations under the Special Regime, but it did not specify the duration of those rights.\n\n262.\n\nThis was replaced by relevant provisions of the Spanish Electrical Power Law 54/1997:\n\nArticle 21(4). An Administrative Register of Electricity Generation Installations is hereby created in the Ministry of Industry and Energy in which all those electricity generation installations that have been authorised must be entered together with their conditions and especially the capacity of the installation.\n\nArticle 31. Electricity installations falling under the special regime must be entered in the Administrative Register of Electricity Generation Installations referred to in point 4 of article 21 of this Act. In each case, the entry shall specify the remunerative arrangements that apply.322\n\n**R-0003**, Law 54/1997, Arts. 21(4), 31.\n\n263.\n\nSubsequent royal decrees were to similar effect, referring back to the Administrative Register created by the 1997 Law.323\n\n**C-0005**, RD 2818/1998, Art. 9 (\u2018For proper monitoring of the special regime\u2019); **C-0007**, RD 436/2004, Art. 9 (\u2018For adequate monitoring of the special regime\u2019); **C-0008**, RD 661/2007, Art. 9 (\u2018In order to ensure appropriate monitoring of the special regime\u2019).\n\n264.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, these are perfectly standard administrative provisions, and do not by themselves imply immutability. The RAIPRE registration was essentially administrative in effect; it qualified applicants to receive FITs but did not entail a binding promise that these would be maintained unchanged.\n\n265.\n\nIn that respect, the tribunal in *Charanne* held that:\n\n[T]he Respondent has convincingly proved that, under Spanish law, registration with the RAIPRE was a mere administrative requirement in order to be able to sell energy, and by no means implied that registered facilities had a vested right to a certain remuneration.324\n\n**RL-0049**, *Charanne*, \u00b6 510.\n\n266.\n\nNor has the Claimant established that, as a matter of Spanish law, the operating companies had a vested right to a particular remuneration. The Spanish courts have consistently denied there was any such right. For example, in relation to an appeal brought against RD 436/2004, the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court stated in its Judgment of 15 December 2005:\n\nThere is no legal obstacle that exists to prevent the Government in the exercise of the regulatory powers and of the broad entitlements it has in a strongly regulated issue such as electricity, from modifying a specific system of remuneration as long as [the Government stays] within the framework set out by the ELS [1999 Electricity Law]325\n\n**R-0137**, *2005 Judgment*, eighth legal ground.\n\n267.\n\nThe Third Chamber also stated in its Judgment of 25 October 2006 in relation to amendments made to RD 436/2004:\n\nUntil it is replaced by another, [Article 30 of the Electricity Law] allows the respective companies to expect that the fixing of the premiums can be included as a factor relevant to their obtaining \"reasonable rates of return with reference the cost of money in the capital market\" or, to put it again in the words of the preamble to Royal Decree 436/2004, \"reasonable compensation for their investments.\" However the payment regime under examination does not guarantee to special regime electricity producers that a certain level of profits or revenues will be unchanged relative to those obtained in previous years, or that the formulas for fixing the premiums will stay unchanged.326\n\n**R-0138**, *2006 Judgment*, third legal ground.\n\n268.\n\nAgain, on 20 March 2007, the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court stated:\n\nWhat article 30 of the [1997 Act] allows companies is to aspire that the premiums would include [\u2026] reasonable return rates in relation to the cost of money in the capital market; that is, a reasonable return on their investments. Owners of facilities under a Special Regime are not guaranteed the intangibility of a given benefit or income regime in relation to those obtained in previous years, nor are they guaranteed the indefinite permanence of the formulas used to fix premiums. Changes should be made within the legal limits.327\n\n**R-0139**, *2007 Judgment*, second legal ground.\n\n269.\n\nFurthermore, the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court has stated on many occasions that the \u2018public regulatory framework [\u2026] could not subsequently be immune to any relevant modifications to basic economic data in the light of which it is logical for the public authorities to keep in step with the new circumstances.\u2019328\n\n**R-0140**, Supreme Court Third Chamber Judgments of 18 July 2012 (Appeal 19/11), of 5 November 2012 (Appeal 103/2011), of 9 November 2012 (Appeal 89/2011), of 12 November 2012 (Appeal 98 and 110/11), of 16 November 2012 (Appeal 116/11), of 21 November 2012 (Appeal 34/2011).\n\n270.\n\nIn its decision of 3 December 2009 rejecting a challenge to RD 661/2007, the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court stated:\n\nNor can recognition of the right of producers under the special regime to the immutability of this regime be understood, since the Government, according to the intent of the Legislator, holds a margin of assessment to determine the energy outputs offered, in line with clear targets inherent in the execution of the economic, energy and environmental policies, and taking into consideration in the exercising of its regulatory power the obvious and essential general interests involved in the correct operation of the electricity production and distribution system and, in particular, the rights of the users.329\n\n**R-0141**, *2009 Judgment*, fourth legal ground.\n\n271.\n\nIt added that \u2018the principle of legal certainty [\u2026] does not include any right to the freezing of the existing legal system\u2019.330\n\nIbid.\n\n272.\n\nIn short, expropriation of intangible rights requires, *inter alia*, that the rights in question exist under the relevant legal system, which is not the case here.\n\n273.\n\nIt may be recalled that no ECT tribunal has yet upheld an Article 13 claim in relation to the Disputed Measures. Such claims have either been avoided on the ground that the dispute was covered by Article 10 or rejected outright.331\n\nAs in **RL-0049**, *Charanne*, \u00b6\u00b6 460-467; **CL-0112**, *Novenergia II*, \u00b6\u00b6 759-763, **RL-0024**, *Isolux*, \u00b6\u00b6 837-854.\n\n274.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim fails because the right claimed to have been expropriated was not an acquired right susceptible of expropriation. Had the expropriation claim been made in respect of the Claimant\u2019s 100% indirect interest in the project companies, that claim would have also failed, because the plants are still intact and operating under the Claimant\u2019s ultimate control and continued oversight, although their value is impaired. Two of the wind farms are still receiving subsidies. In sum, the Claimant has alleged no conduct on the part of Spain that is tantamount to expropriation, and consequently the Article 13 claim fails.\n\n275.\n\nIn the end, the Claimant\u2019s main argument has been that the subsidy regime of RD 661/2007 was to be maintained in its essentials by virtue of Article 10(1) of the ECT, not that it was a vested right. Its chief claim is to stability, not immutability. It is to that claim that the Tribunal turns.\n\n**B. SPAIN\u2019S ALLEGED BREACH OF ARTICLE 10(1) OF THE ECT, FIRST & SECOND SENTENCES**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n***a. The FET standard***\n-------------------------\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the FET standard under the ECT is especially protective of investors\u2019 legitimate expectations with respect to regulatory environments. Article 10(1) of the ECT requires states to provide \u2018fair and equitable\u2019 treatment and sets a higher standard of protection than the typical FET standard of a bilateral investment treaty, by requiring states to create \u2018stable\u2019 and \u2018favourable\u2019 conditions,332 particularly, for environmentally-friendly energy investments, as follows from the ECT\u2019s object and purpose.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 205, 206.\n\n277.\n\nInvestment tribunals have confirmed that the FET standard requires states to offer \u2018consistent and transparent behaviour\u2019,333 to grant and maintain a stable and predictable regulatory framework to fulfil the justified expectations of a foreign investor at the time of the investment.334 This special feature of the ECT does not prevent Spain from changing its regulatory framework, but commits Spain to \u2018provide fundamental stability in the essential characteristics of the legal regime relied upon by investors in making long-term investments,\u2019 as held by the tribunal in *Eiser v. Spain*.335\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 187-194, citing **CL-0020**, *LG&E Energy Corp. and others v.

Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 207-209, citing **CL-0079**, *Eiser*, \u00b6 382.\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimant argues that legitimate expectations are to be determined objectively, having regard to the regulatory framework in place at the time of the investment. This is especially so, when such framework is designed to address the needs of a special class of long-term investors, like investors in energy generation facilities.336 The adoption of retroactive legislation is one of the strongest forms of regulatory instability and disfavouring treatment, and the European Commission has discouraged states from retroactive regulatory intervention in the electricity sector.337\n\nCl.

During that period, all of Claimant\u2019s SPCs were entitled to benefit from the Special Regime, last revised through RD 661/2007.339 Relying, among others, on *Saluka v. Czech Republic*,340 the Claimant argues that, for the purposes of determining when Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations were formed, the Tribunal should see the constituent parts of Claimant\u2019s investment in Spain as an indivisible whole;341 with Claimant\u2019s decision to invest based on an assessment of the regulatory framework existing at the time of the investment and the changes made during the investment process, including RD 661/2007.342\n\nThe Claimant submits that its contributions to Spain began long before any conceivable concern about Spain\u2019s economic situation. The Claimant affirms that it began considering investing in wind power in Spain in 1992 when Tomen and SeaWest Espa\u00f1a explored sites in Galicia and Asturias; in 1995 Eurus presented its strategic plan to the Xunta; and in 1997 Eurus began its investment.

Spain breached Article 10(1) of the ECT by violating Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimant did not expect Spain to petrify its regulatory framework, but it expected that Spain would not significantly weaken or take away the Special Regime in respect of any existing SPC for the duration of its operational lifetime. The Claimant expected that its investments would benefit from a regime at least as favourable as that set out in RD 661/2007.344 Brattle, the Claimant\u2019s regulatory expert, explains in its Regulatory Report that stable governmental Special Regimes are critical to attract long-term investment in wind power, as such investments have high up-front costs and must operate a long time to recoup those costs.345\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 204.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 218, citing **CE-1**, Brattle First Regulatory Report, 18 November 2016, \u00b6 9.\n\n282.\n\nThe Claimant argues that its expectations of stability, *i.e.* that the subsidies to the Claimant\u2019s SPCs would not be retroactively revoked, were legitimate on the basis that the Special Regime legislation included provisions that signalled Spain\u2019s view of the FITs as a way to encourage long-term energy investments to reach its long-term environmental goals.346\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 225; Cl. Reply, \u00b6 244.\n\n283.\n\nFurther, other contextual sources confirm that the Claimant\u2019s expectations arising out of Spain\u2019s legislation were legitimate:\n\n(1) The Preamble of RD 2366/1994 states that renewable energies reduce the consumption of conventional primary energy with a positive impact on environmental protection.347 Article 7 of RD 2366/1994 stated that Special Producers, such as all of the Claimant\u2019s projects, had the right to \u2018transfer their excess energy to the electricity distribution company, provided it [was] possible for such energy to be absorbed by the grid and to receive in exchange the price resulting from the provisions of this Royal Decree.\u2019 Spain did not include language to limit the duration of such right.348 Also, in setting out the formula to calculate the additional compensation above the market price (\u2018coefficient\u2019) that Special Procedures would receive, Article 18 of RD 2366/1994 stated that after a period of five years, the value of the coefficient shall \u2018remain constant,\u2019 without including any language to contradict the message that it would continue so long as the facilities of Special Producers were able to produce power.349\n\n(2) The preamble of Law 54/1997 placed the promotion of renewable energies above all considerations in Spain\u2019s energy policy. Further, the Eighth transitory provision of Law 54/1997 provided that in the case that premiums were revised in the future, existing Special Producers would be entitled to choose to be covered by whatever economic arrangements were applicable to them under Law 54/1997.350\n\n(3) The preamble of RD 2818/1998 expressly stated that there was \u2018no time limit\u2019 for the incentives granted to Special Producers, and explained the economic logic behind that decision, as the inability of renewable energy facilities to compete in a free market due to their characteristics, technologies and higher costs. Article 32 of RD 2818/1998 established that Special Producers could continue to be subject to the previous remuneration schemes, even in case of revision of the premiums set in RD 2818/1998, by reference to the eighth transitory provision of Law 54/1997.351\n\n(4) The preamble of RD 436/2004 referred to the \u2018security and stability\u2019 of the calculation method of the remuneration under the special regime to \u2018foster investment in this kind of plants.\u2019352 Article 1(b) of RD 436/2004 stated that the purpose of the decree was to establish a lasting economic regime for plants eligible to be under the special regime, based on an objective, transparent methodology to calculate the remuneration. Article 34 set out a timeline for wind power facilities to receive a certain tariff from the 15th year *onwards* (emphasis added), *i.e.* on an indefinite basis.353 Article 40 provided explicitly that future revisions to incentive rates would not apply to existing facilities.354\n\n(5) Article 36 of RD 661/2007 set out that wind power facilities would be entitled to receive certain financial incentives the first 15 years and then, certain incentives *thereafter* (emphasis added), *i.e.* indefinitely in time.355\n\nCl.

They reported that major adverse changes in the policy toward wind power were highly unlikely in the foreseeable future and that the risk that electricity prices decrease in the future was mitigated by the regulatory framework, which promoted the renewable energy sector without a time limit.356 The Claimant also rejects Spain\u2019s suggestion that Eurus\u2019 due diligence was insufficient with regard to the case-law of the Spanish Supreme Court from October 2006. Eurus notes that its investment began in 1997 and only one of its facilities, Grallas, was approved after October 2006.357\n\nCl.

Spain breached Article 10(1) of the ECT by failing to maintain stable and favourable conditions for the Claimant\u2019s investment***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Spain\u2019s retroactive changes to the Special Regime also constitute unstable and unfavourable conditions for its investment, in breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Claimant does not dispute that Spain could alter the Special Regime as applied to new projects and new investors. But Spain violated the FET standard by retroactively and fundamentally changing the Special Regime into a new regulatory framework, reducing the value of the Claimant\u2019s investment to about one third of what it used to be.360\n\nCl.

Argentina* recognized a state\u2019s power to fix the tariffs of a public utility, if operation costs can be recovered, investments amortized and a reasonable return over time can be made.361 Yet, the Disputed Measures fail to meet these conditions. Spain says that the Disputed Measures maintained stability, as they were consistent with the principle governing the investments made under Law 54/1997, \u2018to ensure that all investors could recover, by taking a \"standard facility\" as a reference, (1) the cost of their investment, (2) the operating costs and (3) obtain reasonable rate of return.\u2019362 The Claimant disputes that tying subsidies to the costs of hypothetical standard facilities in 2014, at the time of the Disputed Measures, which did not form part of Spain\u2019s regulatory framework when the Claimant invested and subsequently expanded its investment, fails to ensure that existing investors can recover the costs of wind facilities built from 1997 to 2008.

The Claimant\u2019s position on the internal rate of return (IRR)***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s expert Brattle rebutted the IRR analysis as put forward by the Respondent\u2019s expert BDO. It made two main points. First, it disagreed with the use of individual plant cash flows instead of a target standard installation. Second, BDO\u2019s methodology was inaccurate as it overstated the IRR and understated the required return.368\n\n**CE-5**, Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, 29 September 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 51-54.\n\n290.\n\nSince Eurus\u2019s plants have had a higher production than the standard installations in the past, it is reasonable for Eurus to receive higher returns. Yet, BDO\u2019s IRR analysis takes advantage of this situation and uses the Claimant\u2019s high profitability to deny any negative impact to the Disputed Measures. By using the cash flows of a standard facility this scenario would be avoided.369\n\n**CE-5**, Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, 29 September 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 55-60; Hearing Day 3, p. 31, ll 3ff (Mr. Lapuerta); Hearing Day 3, p. 165, ll 18ff (Mr. Caldwell).\n\n291.\n\nFurthermore, Brattle argued that BDO omitted to include in the analysis important portions of the initial investment costs, which fell into two categories: \u2018Financing and other\u2019 costs, and \u2018Development/Advisory\u2019 costs. Brattle did include these costs in their analysis and as a result, the IRR as calculated by BDO dropped from 15.1% to 12.5%.370\n\n**CE-5**, Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, 29 September 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 61-70.\n\n292.\n\nFinally, Brattle maintained that the reasonable return expected by the Claimant is higher than what BDO considered reasonable. BDO underestimated the return for three reasons. First, the Claimant\u2019s lack of liquidity raised the risk and would have therefore led to higher required returns. Second, BDO imputed to the plants the tax benefits of debt financing, which is inconsistent with the exclusion of \u2018Financing and other\u2019 costs from the IRR calculation. Third, BDO did not include the construction risk, which would raise the cost of capital by up to 0.5%. Furthermore, BDO estimated the pre-tax WACCs per year by grossing up its estimate using an effective tax rate of 22%. While the need to apply an effective tax rate was not disputed, the tax rate as applied by BDO was incorrect. The rate has not been constant over the years and should be calculated for each year individually.371\n\n**CE-5**, Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, 29 September 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 71-83.\n\n293.\n\nAs a result, the reasonable return before taxes in 2007 according to Brattle was 9.8% with an after-tax equivalent of 7.3%. This is supported by the 7.398% (pre-tax) that Spain considered reasonable at the time.372\n\n**CE-5**, Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, 29 September 2017, \u00b6 82.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s expectations were not legitimate***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nSpain argues that the Claimant expected that any changes to the Special Regime would apply only prospectively, petrifying the Special Regime with respect to the Claimant\u2019s existing facilities, and that in effect it had an acquired right to future tariffs to be received for the entire useful life of a facility.373 Yet, such expectation was not reasonable considering either the regulatory framework applicable at the time of investment and its evolution thereafter, or other sources referenced by the Claimant.374\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 981, 983.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1008, 1009.\n\n295.\n\nSpain agrees with the Claimant in that the legitimacy of an investor\u2019s expectations must be analysed objectively. The Tribunal should assess what the investor knew or should reasonably have known about the conduct of the host state, as upheld by the tribunal in *Electrabel v. Hungary.*375 Here, Spain\u2019s conduct is expressed in the regulatory framework existing at the time of the investment, which, as decided by the tribunal in *Charanne v. Spain*, an investor should diligently analyse to support the legitimacy of its expectations.376\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 984, \u00b6 986, citing **RL-0048**, *Electrabel (Award)*, \u00b6 7.78.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 987, citing **RL-0049**, *Charanne*, \u00b6\u00b6 495, 505.\n\n296.\n\nSpain maintains that the Claimant fails to show that it performed a diligent analysis of the existing legal framework,377 which a foreign investor in a highly regulated sector, like the energy sector, should perform.378 The Claimant failed to produce the due diligence reports that the Spanish law firm Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez made before the Claimant invested in Spain in 1996.379\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6 721.\n\n297.\n\nBesides, a serious and reasonable assessment of the Spanish regulatory framework and of its possible changes was required in light of the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Spain. In December 2005 and October 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that the premiums and incentives to produce electrical energy under the Special Regime might increase as much as they might decrease from one year to the next.380\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 723, 729.\n\n298.\n\nFurther, a diligent investor should have verified the limits of the regulator\u2019s power to change the applicable framework. Such limits, Spain says, were found in Law 54/1997, which sets the principle of \u2018reasonable return\u2019 and \u2018economic sustainability of the SES\u2019.381 But, as follows from the witness statement of Mr. Suwabe, the Claimant expected to receive remuneration in the terms set in RD 661/2007 throughout the lifetime of its SPCs. In other words, the Claimant expected that the regulatory framework set out in RD 661/2007 would be set in stone with respect to Claimant\u2019s investment, unless a more favourable one would become available.382\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 997.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 704, 706.\n\n299.\n\nEven if the Tribunal found that the Claimant was diligent in its investment decisions, the Disputed Measures did not violate Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations. Relying *inter alia* on *Charanne v. Spain*, *Electrabel v. Hungary*, and *Blusun v. Italy*,383 Spain contends that in the absence of specific commitments by a state, an investor cannot legitimately expect that a certain regulatory framework will remain unchanged.384 As Spain made no specific commitments to the Claimant that it would not change the Special Regime, the Claimant could not legitimately expect that the Spanish regulatory framework would remain unchanged.385 The Claimant\u2019s lack of diligence rendered its expectations unrealistic and lacking any objectivity. Therefore, a claim based on alleged breach of such expectations must be dismissed.386\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6 1000.\n\n300.\n\nAlso, the Claimant\u2019s expectations were unreasonable considering the regulatory framework in place at the time of investment and its development thereafter. The regulatory framework evolved between 1997 and 2008 in manner that revealed the possibility of regulatory changes adversely affecting the remuneration of the Claimant\u2019s wind farms, for example, in the case of RD 436/2004.387\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 1015.\n\n301.\n\nA diligent investor would know that Spain\u2019s electricity system was governed by essential principles, including, among others, the principle of regulatory hierarchy, the principle of economic sustainability and the principle of reasonable return.388 These regulatory standards were based on Law 54/1997 and the case law, not on RD 661/2007. A diligent investor cannot legitimately expect that Spain would not adopt measures to resolve the tariff deficit affecting the sustainability of the SES, or that public subsidies would be maintained after the plants had achieved the corresponding target return.389\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 1010; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 726, 732.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1011-1013.\n\n302.\n\nThe other sources referenced by the Claimant could not legitimately reinforce Claimant\u2019s expectations that the Special Regime would remain unchanged.\n\n(i) The competence to set the regulatory regime of the remuneration of electricity production lies with the state, not the Autonomous Communities, as provided by Article 3(1)(c) of Law 54/1997. Therefore, neither an administrative act from the Autonomous Communities of Galicia and Asturias nor any alleged guarantee from their President could generate a legitimate expectation that the regulatory regime would remain unchanged.390\n\n(ii) The certificates for registration in the RAIPRE did not shield the plants from being subject to the changes introduced by RD 2818/1998, RD 436/2004, RD-Law 7/2006 or RD 661/2007. Such registration was an administrative step required from ordinary and special regime producers, to control their participation in the SES. The tribunal in *Charanne* confirmed the view that such registration did not give producers an acquired right to a rate so as to establish the expectation that such rate would not be changed.391\n\n(iii) The contracts that the Claimant signed with Spanish distributors cannot be characterized as PPAs. These contracts simply established the settlement of the subsidies that distributors paid to producers, for which the distributors were later reimbursed by the regulator. The amounts paid under those contracts were determined by the applicable regulations, and not by the distributor and the producer. In any case, RD 661/2007 modified those contracts (the CNE taking over the distributors\u2019 settlement functions) and the contracts expressly contemplated the possibility of the regulatory framework being modified.392\n\nResp.

Spain created stable conditions for the Claimant\u2019s investment***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nSpain argues that \u2018stable conditions\u2019 admit the adoption of reasonable and proportionate macroeconomic control measures motivated by a reasonable cause, as supported by the tribunals in *Plama v. Bulgaria*,393*AES Summit v. Hungary*,394 and *Mamidoil v.

Yet, Spain argues, the tribunal in *Eiser* precisely failed to consider that essential element of the Spanish regulatory framework.399\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 773-778, 781.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 776.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 789.\n\n305.\n\nSpain also created stable conditions, since the Disputed Measures were not retroactive.400 For legislation to be retroactive, it must affect acquired rights, as decided by the tribunal in *Nations Energy v. Panama*.401 The Claimant did not have acquired rights to receive immutable tariffs. The Spanish Constitutional Court has repeatedly ruled that the measures adopted since RD-Law 9/2013 apply to the future and are not retroactive, as they do not affect acquired rights.402\n\nResp.

Italy* found that, in the absence of express commitments by a state, the obligation to create stable conditions does not prevent the state from changing its regulations.403 A distinction is to be made between contractual commitments and expectations underlying a given relationship, \u2018the latter are more matters to be taken into account in applying other norms than they are norms in their own right.\u2019404 Spain argues that this interpretation on the limits of a state\u2019s regulatory power is directly linked to the objective of the ECT to create an efficient energy market and to the stable conditions standard of Article 10(1) of the ECT. According to Article 2 of the ECT, the main objectives of the ECT are the need to ensure market efficiency, non-discrimination, and market-led pricing. Article 9 of the ECT provides that nothing prevents a Contracting Party from taking measures to ensure the integrity and stability of its financial system and capital markets. Spain argues that these provisions should be considered when assessing whether the measures complied with the obligation to create stable conditions. The Disputed Measures have not prevented the Claimant from pursuing its economic activity, with its plants operating normally.405\n\nResp.

The Respondent\u2019s position on the IRR***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nThe Respondent argues that an analysis of the IRR proves that the Disputed Measures did not have a negative impact on the Claimant\u2019s investment and are therefore proportionate. To this end it compares the project IRR to the WACC.\n\n308.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, there is a difference between the project IRR and the shareholder IRR. The former represents the return considering the operating cash flows without taking into account how the project has been funded. It constitutes the internal rate of return which will be earned on the project.406 According to Order IET/1045/2014 of 16 June 2014, the pre-tax project IRR in Spain should be about 7.398%. The latter represents the return of the shareholders as generated by the project and constitutes the final return of the shareholders taking into account both the cash flows and the funding of the project.407 Finally, according to the EC and an analysis of the market, a project IRR of 7.398% is reasonable and proportionate.408\n\nHearing Day 4, p. 26, ll 18ff (Mr. MacGregor).\n\n**RE-1**, Expert Report of BDO, 11 April 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 138ff; Hearing Day 4, p. 26, ll 24ff (Mr. MacGregor).\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 519-527.\n\n309.\n\nMoreover, the project IRR should be similar to the WACC, which constitutes a useful comparator. The WACC is calculated by taking into account the cost demanded by shareholders and the providers of external financing. This is then weighted against the total financing costs. According to BDO\u2019s calculations, the applicable WACC is 4.90% after tax.409 The applicable pre-tax WACC is 7.36%.410\n\n**RE-1**, Expert Report of BDO, 11 April 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 148ff.\n\n**RE-1**, Expert Report of BDO, 11 April 2017, \u00b6 172.\n\n310.\n\nTo assess Eurus\u2019s return rate, BDO assumed a useful life of 20 years over which the cash flows of the investor have been taken into account.411 Having assessed all available data, BDO considers the pre-tax project IRR to be 15.15%.412 This number is far higher than the reasonable return under the new Spanish incentive regime or the pre-tax WACC. Hence, there is no negative impact on the Claimant\u2019s investment through the Disputed Measures.413\n\nHearing Day 4, p. 34, ll 1ff (Mr. MacGregor).\n\n**RE-1**, Expert Report of BDO, 11 April 2017, \u00b6 172.\n\n**RE-1**, Expert Report of BDO, 11 April 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 168ff, BDO working papers, Tables F and G.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nAs noted in paragraph 240 above, the Tribunal will first consider Eurus\u2019s claim under Article 10(1) of the ECT, first and second sentence, on its merits, without reference to EU state aid law. The analysis and conclusions set forth in this subsection (\u00b6\u00b6 311-369) are adopted by majority. Arbitrator Garibaldi dissents in respect of the overall conclusion and most aspects of the supporting reasoning. The extent of the dissent and the reasons therefor are stated in a Partially Dissenting Opinion, appended hereto.\n\n***a. The applicable ECT standard***\n------------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT, first and second sentences, provide in relevant part as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.\n\n313.\n\nThese provisions have been extensively discussed in successive arbitral decisions,414 and there is little point in the Tribunal going over the same ground. But some general points can be made.\n\nSee, e.g., **CL-0051**, *Petrobart Limited v. Kyrgyz Republic* (SCC Case No. 126/2003), Arbitral Award, 29 March 2005; **RL-0034**, *Plama v. Bulgaria*; **RL-0039**, *AES Summit v. Hungary*; **CL-0018** or **RL-0002**, *Electrabel*; **RL-0077**, *Hulley*; **RL-0078**, *Yukos v. Russia*; **RL-0048**, *Electrabel (Award)*; **RL-0049**, *Charanne*; **RL-0024**, *Isolux*; **CL-0083** or **RL-0074**, *Blusun*; **CL-0079**, *Eiser*.\n\n314.\n\nThe Claimant laid emphasis on the phrase \u2018stable, equitable, favourable and transparent\u2019 (Article 10(1) of the ECT, first sentence).415 But, as several tribunals have noted, the first sentence of Article 10(1) cannot be interpreted in isolation from the second sentence.416 It does not give a general mandate to ECT tribunals to decide whether government decisions affecting investments are \u2018equitable\u2019 or \u2018favourable\u2019, any more than the FET standard gives a general discretion to BIT tribunals to impose their own views as to \u2018fairness\u2019 and \u2018equity\u2019. The legal standard embodied in the first and second sentences of Article 10(1) takes into account the prerogatives and responsibilities of governments as well as the rights and interests of investors, including their interest in stability.\n\nSee Cl. Reply, \u00b6 206.\n\nSee **CL-0083**, *Blusun*, \u00b6 319(3); **CL-0115**, *Antaris*, \u00b6 365; **CL-0112**, *Novenergia II*, \u00b6\u00b6 642-646; *contra* *Rupert Binder v. Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL), Award on Jurisdiction, 15 July 2011, \u00b6 446.\n\n315.\n\nOf particular relevance by reason of its subsidies context (though it concerned PV power, not wind) is the award of the tribunal in *Blusun v. Italy*. There the tribunal concluded:\n\nIn the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to grant subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted. But if they are lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.417\n\nThe tribunal went on to add:\n\nThese considerations apply even more strongly when the context is subsidies or the payment of special benefits for particular economic sectors.418\n\n**CL-0083**, *Blusun*, \u00b6 319(5).\n\n**CL-0083**, *Blusun*, \u00b6 372.\n\n316.\n\nIt may be objected that this formulation makes no reference to legitimate expectations, which have become something of a *leitmotif* in the case-law on the fair and equitable treatment standard. The *Blusun* tribunal explained the matter in the following terms:\n\nIt is [\u2026] true that a representation as to future conduct of the state could be made in the form of a law, sufficiently clearly expressed. But there is still a clear distinction between a law, i.e. a norm of greater or lesser generality creating rights and obligations while it remains in force, and a promise or contractual commitment. There is a further distinction between contractual commitments and expectations underlying a given relationship: however legitimate, the latter are more matters to be taken into account in applying other norms than they are norms in their own right. International law does not make binding that which was not binding in the first place, nor render perpetual what was temporary only.419\n\n**CL-0083**, *Blusun*, \u00b6 371.\n\n317.\n\nOn this view, legitimate expectations are essentially *consideranda*. The term itself does not appear in the ECT, or for that matter in BITs, and there is no rule that legitimate expectations are to be observed, analogous to the *pacta sunt servanda* rule in the law of treaties. Rather, they are relevant factors to be taken into account in the interpretation and application of treaty standards such as Article 10(1) of the ECT, first and second sentences.\n\n318.\n\nThe *Blusun* test was endorsed by both Parties in their pleadings.420\n\nCl.

The Article 10(1) standard applied to the Claimant\u2019s Wind Farms***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nApplying the *Blusun* dictum, it is necessary to ask the following questions: (i) was there a specific commitment of intangibility; (ii) absent a specific commitment, did the Claimant entertain a legitimate expectation that subsidies would not be reduced during the lifetime of the project; (iii) were the subsidies lawfully granted; (iv) were the changes of 2013-14 disproportionate to the legitimate aim of the legislative amendments; and (v) did they have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who had committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime. By way of summary, in the following sections, the Tribunal answers these questions as follows: (i) no specific commitments were made; (ii) the Claimant had legitimate expectations that subsidies would be continued in some substantial form, but not that the subsidies regime of RD 661/2007 would be maintained as such for the life of the investment; (iii) subject to EU law (considered below) the subsidies were lawfully granted; (iv) in all but one respect (the claw-back of benefits already paid) the Disputed Measures were not disproportionate, given the circumstances in which they were imposed; (v) to the same effect, the changes, had they been applied without the claw-back, had due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients.\n\n320.\n\nIn the following sub-sections, the Tribunal gives its reasons for these conclusions.\n\n***(i) Was there a specific commitment as to the FIT regime?***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal has already dealt with and rejected the argument that RAIPRE registration itself implied a commitment to the Special Regime.421 The Claimant expressly accepted that there was no specific commitment made as to the immutability of the FIT regime under RD 661/2007.422 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this is correct. Not only is it consistent with the position taken by the Spanish courts in relation both to RD 436/2004423 and RD 661/2007;424 it is also consistent with the conclusions reached by most of the tribunals which have considered the matter.425\n\nSee above, \u00b6\u00b6 260-265.\n\nClaimant did argue that Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 acted as a stabilization clause, but it accepted that the amounts payable by way of subsidy were not frozen but were the subject of a stability obligation in terms of the first sentence of Art. 10(1) of the ECT: in effect a more flexible guarantee. See Cl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 117, 119, 213; Cl. Reply, \u00b6 246; Hearing Day 5, p. 27, l 20; p. 29, l 20; p. 311, ll 3ff; p. 33, ll 3ff; p. 34, ll 1ff. Consistently with this, the Claimant made no claim under ECT Article 10(1), final sentence (the umbrella clause). See also Claimant\u2019s letter of 29 April 2019: \u2018Spain [\u2026] makes much of the RREEF decision\u2019s holding that investors could not expect a frozen regulatory regime, but of course this has no bearing whatsoever on the present proceeding, since *Eurus has never contested that right*\u2019 (emphasis in original).\n\nSee above, \u00b6\u00b6 266-269.\n\nSee above, \u00b6 270.\n\n**RL-0071**, *Eiser*, \u00b6\u00b6 363, 387; **RL-0049**, *Charanne*, \u00b6 503; **CL-0114**, *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31), Award, 15 June 2018, \u00b6\u00b6 553, 555; **RL-0024**, *Isolux*, \u00b6\u00b6 774, 787. In *Masdar*, the tribunal held there was a \u2018specific commitment [\u2026] that each of the Plants qualified under the RD661/2007 economic regime for their \"*operational lifetime*\"\u2019 (**CL-0113**, *Masdar*, \u00b6 520). In the present case there was no equivalent letter to the one construed by that tribunal as a guarantee. It also held that \u2018RD661/2007 [\u2026] include[s] a stabilisation clause [which] is sufficient to exclude *any* modification of the law, so far as investors, which had made investments in reliance upon its terms, were concerned\u2019 (**CL-0113**, *Masdar*, \u00b6 503 (emphasis added)).\n\n322.\n\n*A fortiori*, the assurances said to have been given to Eurus Japan by the President of the Xunta of Galicia on a visit to Japan426 did not amount to specific commitments. Oral statements made on promotional occasions are not sufficient for this purpose, quite apart from the inevitable uncertainty as to just what was said. The Tribunal also accepts the Respondent\u2019s argument that a representative of an Autonomous Community had no competence to create financial obligations of Spain regarding the SES.427 As a result, the approval of EuroVento\u2019s strategic long-term plan by Galicia\u2019s Xunta and the government of Asturias and the granting of Special Producer status to the Claimant\u2019s SPCs also do not give rise to legitimate expectations. Neither can the fact that Spanish state-owned utilities entered into PPAs with the Claimant\u2019s SPCs be seen as creating legitimate expectations vis-\u00e0-vis the Spanish state.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 62. See above, \u00b6\u00b6 120-134, 279.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1020-1023.\n\n***(ii) What legitimate expectations did the Claimant have?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nThe Claimant did however argue that it had legitimate expectations that Spain would not revoke or significantly weaken the Special Regime as applicable to existing projects, so Eurus expected that the remuneration of RD 661/2007 would continue to apply to its investment.428\n\nCf Cl. Mem., \u00b6 216; Cl. Reply, \u00b6 239.\n\n324.\n\nIn fact, all but one of the Claimant\u2019s wind farms was commissioned before the entry into force of RD 661/2007, the first three of them before even the enactment of the 1997 Law.429 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, as a matter of general principle, a legitimate expectation is a form of reliance interest which must relate to facts or circumstances in existence at the time the investment is made.430 The Claimant argued that it is possible for expectations to be enhanced by subsequent developments: for example, an investor could be seen as relying on a new decree if the investment was maintained (as distinct from being sold) after the decree was passed.431 Any such construction would imply that investors\u2019 expectations simply track the state of the law from time to time, and the idea of a reliance interest would lose all autonomy. Moreover, the continuous updating of legitimate expectations that such a theory would seem to imply cannot explain why expectations should always be enhanced as distinct from being impaired by subsequent developments. If they can be as easily destroyed as created, they would lose much of their value as a conduit of stability.\n\nCf Cl. Mem., Appendix II: Eos Pax IIa SL (Paxareiras I and Paxareiras IIa), Parque E\u00f3lico de Barbanza SA (Barbanza), and Parque E\u00f3lico Vicedo SL (Vicedo).\n\nFor the proposition that legitimate expectations are those existing at the time of the investment, see, e.g., **RL-0080**, *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18), Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 14 January 2010, \u00b6 264; **RL-0081**, *Philip Morris Brands S\u00c0RL and others v.

These last two provided that:\n\nThe tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of the revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to the plants that commence operating subsequent to the date of the entry into force referred to in the paragraph above and shall not have a backdated effect on any previous tariffs and premiums.433 (RD 436/2004, Article 40(3))\n\nThe revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January of the second year following the year in which the revision shall have been performed.434 (RD 661/2007, Article 44(3), 3rd sub-paragraph)\n\nCl.

Reply, \u00b6 244, citing **C-0005**, Royal Decree 2818/1998, Preamble.\n\n329.\n\nEven though the Claimant admitted that RD 1614/2010 did not have a significant effect on its investment, it was the precursor of Spain\u2019s overhaul. In this context, reference might also be made to Article 5(3) of RD 1614 **/** 2010, which provided that:\n\nNotwithstanding that established by this Royal Decree, for wind technology facilities that come under Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25 May, revisions of tariffs and premiums, both upper and lower, referred to by article 44.3 of the aforementioned Royal Decree will not affect facilities entered definitively in the administrative Register for production facilities operating under the special system and reporting to the Directorate General of Energy Policy and Mines on 7 May 2009 [\u2026].436\n\n**C-0010**, RD 1614/2010, Art. 5(3).\n\n330.\n\nOf particular importance is the Spanish Electric Power Law 54/1997, which was in force until its repeal in 2013. Article 30(4) provided that:\n\nThe remuneration arrangements for electric power generation installations operating under the special regime shall be supplemented by the payment of a premium under statutory terms set out in regulations and in the following cases:\n\n[\u2026]\n\nTo work out the premiums, the voltage level on delivery of the power to the network, the effective contribution to environmental improvement, to primary energy saving and energy efficiency, [\u2026] and the investment costs incurred *shall all be taken into account so as to achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of money on capital markets*.437 (emphasis added)\n\n**C-0004** and **R-0003**, Law 54/1997, Art. 30(4).\n\n331.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this Law stated a coherent general principle and is inconsistent with the thesis that particular Royal Decrees, notably RD 661/2007, stabilized the regime. The 1997 Law was to be implemented by regulations which would likely to change and did change, and not in any uniform direction favouring the recipients.\n\n332.\n\nIn particular, there was no legitimate expectation that subsidies would never be reduced or capped. Some decrees grandfathered existing plants, but others did not, and although grandfathering may be best practice, it is not in the Tribunal\u2019s view required by the ECT. In this regard, this Tribunal disagrees with the tribunal in *Cube* which was of the view that references to a reasonable return did not \u2018signified a limit on the profit that a producer could earn\u2019.438 Nor does the Tribunal accept that the three \u2018grandfather clauses\u2019 cited above established any general principle, as also held by the tribunal in *RREEF*.439\n\n**RL-0090**, *Cube*, \u00b6 293: \u2018293. We do not consider that the references in RD 661/2007 to a \"reasonable return\" were intended to have any application outside the context of reviews of the tariffs and of the upper and lower limits under Article 44.3 RD 661/2007. In particular, we do not consider that the references to a \"reasonable return\" signified a limit on the profit that a producer could earn from any power facility or group of facilities without suffering a reduction or lower-than-normal increase in tariffs, or that the references provided any basis for changes to the 2007 Regime outside the mechanisms set out in RD 661/2007.\u2019\n\n**RL-0088**, *RREEF*, \u00b6\u00b6318-321.\n\n333.\n\nThe Claimant could not have had legitimate expectations to the remuneration of RD 661/2007, since most of its plants were commissioned between March 1997 and May 2006, and only one was commissioned in February 2008. More specifically, four of Claimant\u2019s projects were commissioned after 15 December 2005,440 while the other projects were commissioned between March 1997 and February 2005. From December 2005 onwards, the Supreme Court said that a specific remuneration system could be changed as long as the changes made were within the framework of the 1997 Law.441\n\n**Fonteavia** and **Bidueiros** both commissioned on 26 December 2005 and belonging to the SPC Parques E\u00f3licos de Buio; and **Alto de Abara** commissioned on 24 May 2006 and **Grallas** on 22 February 2008, belonging to the SPC Parque E\u00f3lico Abara SL. See Cl. Mem., Appendix II.\n\n**R-0137**, *2005 Judgment*, eighth legal ground: \u2018There is no legal obstacle that exists to prevent the Government in the exercise of the regulatory powers and of the broad entitlements it has in a strongly regulated issue such as electricity, from modifying a specific system of remuneration as long as [the Government stays] within the framework set out by the ELS [1999 Electricity Law].\u2019\n\n334.\n\nThe parties disagreed sharply on the relationship between the \u2018reasonable return\u2019 provision stated in Article 30(4) of the 1997 Law and the successive subsidy regimes established by royal decree.442 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this is a false dichotomy. Article 30(4) of the 1997 Law stated a general principle and empowered the administration to give effect to it by regulation. The stream cannot rise higher than its source or commit the state to more than the legislative framework allows. A requirement that the remuneration system be such as to allow recipients \u2018to achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of money on capital markets\u2019 is general in its terms, but it is perfectly intelligible and imposes some limits on what can be done.\n\nSee Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 951-959; Cl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 44-49.\n\n***(iii)Were those legitimate expectations violated by the Disputed Measures?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n335.\n\nTurning to the question of breach, it follows from the analysis of legitimate expectations in paragraphs 323-334 above that it is not sufficient for the Claimant to show that certain expectations were impaired or affected by the measures complained of. To recall the point made specifically with regard to subsidies in *Blusun* :\n\n[I]f it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.443\n\n**RL-0074**, *Blusun*, \u00b6 319(5). The tribunal in *RREEF* relied on *Blusun* (\u00b6\u00b6 516, 547).\n\n336.\n\nThus, it is necessary to assess the proportionality of the change in financial arrangements and whether it had due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients of subsidies.\n\n337.\n\nAs to the aim of the Disputed Measures, the primary reason given, then and now, was to address the deficit on the tariff account of the SES (as to which see paragraphs 131-134 above). This had already been declared to be \u2018unsupportable\u2019 in 2009, and by 2013 had reached nearly EUR 40 billion.444 This was not really contested by Eurus, which instead argued that other measures (notably, increased customer tariffs) could have been adopted to deal with the problem, and that the RE producers should not have been required to bear the whole burden of cuts. Eurus also noted that the Respondent had not made a formal plea of necessity as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness under the law of state responsibility.445 That observation, while true, does not exhaust the relevance of the tariff deficit as the major underlying factor leading to the Disputed Measures.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 297ff.\n\nHearing Day 5, p. 7, ll 2-3 (Mr. Turner), referring to Spain\u2019s justification for the introduction of the regulatory regime.\n\n338.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the growing deficit on the energy account was unsustainable. Moreover, it is not for the Tribunal to second guess reasonable measures taken to address the deficit (including measures affecting existing plants), to propose alternative policies that could have been adopted, or to weigh up for itself the competing demands of generators and consumers. If the measures were \u2018not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and [had] due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime\u2019, they would be consistent with the FET standard in Article 10(1). Applying that standard, it is necessary to differentiate between different aspects of the Disputed Measures.\n\n***(iii) (a) Regulatory rather than actual plant life (20 years rather than 25 or 30 years)?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant summarized its expectation as follows: \u2018Eurus expected that the Incentives Regime would not be worsened or taken away in respect of any particular project for the duration of the project\u2019s operational lifetime.\u2019446\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 204.\n\n340.\n\nWith its Memorial, Eurus presented an expert report by Exponent.447 Exponent was asked to evaluate the operational life of wind turbines on the Claimant\u2019s wind farms. Exponent concluded that the Claimant\u2019s wind farms would at a minimum have a 30-year operational life.448 Based on the findings of Exponent, the Claimant instructed Brattle to project future cash flows for each SPC on the assumption that the wind farms would operate for 30-years.449 This instruction of 30-year operational lifetime was confirmed at the hearing by the testimony of the Claimant\u2019s quantum expert Mr. Caldwell,450 as well as by one of the Claimant\u2019s regulatory experts, Mr. Garc\u00eda.451 In its first Regulatory Report, Brattle states that \u2018the New Regulatory Regime limits the financial incentive to wind farms to the first 20 years of operation. In contrast, RD 661/2007 [\u2026] applied for a wind farm\u2019s entire useful life, which in the case of Eurus\u2019 wind farms, we understand is projected to exceed 30 years.\u2019452 The Claimant argues that Spain failed to submit evidence to challenge the 30-year operational lifetime analysis provided by Exponent.453 On cross-examination, with regard to the statement of Brattle\u2019s first Regulatory Report, Mr. Garc\u00eda was asked:\n\nMS. RIVAS KORTAZAR: Do you recall that, as we have seen at the beginning, those 20 years of useful life was the same reference as used by the Renewable Energy Plan from the year 2005-2010?\n\nDR. GARC\u00cdA: No, I wouldn\u2019t agree with that general statement. I would say that it was the regulatory life defined in the Renewable Energy Plans, not necessarily the useful life of the plant. There\u2019s a distinction between the regulatory life and the useful life.\n\nMS. RIVAS KORTAZAR: I agree with that point. Indeed, the disputed measures refer as well to the regulatory life of the plants; do you agree on that? To a regulatory life of 20 years for wind farms?\n\nDR. GARC\u00cdA: Yes.454\n\n**CE-3**, Exponent Report, 18 November 2016.\n\n**CE-3**, Exponent Report, 18 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8.\n\nCl.

The end of the regulatory life sets the time at which a standard facility has reached the reasonable return set by the Regulator, *i.e.* when the standard facility has recovered its investment and operation costs through the subsidies received.457\n\nResp.

C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 798-811.\n\n342.\n\nAt the Hearing, Spain\u2019s expert Mr. MacGregor stated that \u2018[t]he useful life is generally taken from the accounts: they show useful lives of between 18 years and 25 years, but generally 20 years.\u2019 Also, he stated that the financial models produced by the Claimant before undertaking the investments assumed a 20-year life and that Spain\u2019s Renewable Energy Plan looked at a 20-year useful life for wind farms, without there being any support for the 30-year life argued by the Claimant.458\n\nHearing Day 4, p. 34, ll 2-10 (Mr. MacGregor).\n\n343.\n\nOn this issue, the Tribunal is inclined to disagree with the Respondent. Earlier regulations had been clear that the incentives regime would last for longer than 20 years, though possibly at a reduced level.459 There is a case for 25 years as a reasonable target. Although none of the following cases involved wind turbines (but rather CSP plants),460 all the tribunals considered the useful life of renewable energy plants under the Spanish regulatory regime to be 25 years:\n\n\u2022 In *Antin*, the tribunal noticed that the evidence submitted was inconsistent and the assumed lifetime spanned from 20 to up to 40 years. In particular, the Tribunal noted that substantial repairs to the plants had to be made after 25 years, which would affect the subsidy according to Article 4.3 of RD 661/2007. Based on the evidence submitted, the tribunal decided that the useful life of the plants is 25 years.461\n\n\u2022 In *Eiser*, the tribunal was not convinced by the documentary record submitted to it, which was limited and inconsistent. However, the primary document used, an expert due diligence report, was supportive of a 25-year life. Therefore, the tribunal rejected the claim that the plants were designed for a 40-year life.462\n\n\u2022 In the same vein, the *Masdar* tribunal assumed a life of 25 years rejecting the claimant\u2019s claim as to a 40-year operational life based on the weight of the evidence, which contradicted the claimant\u2019s assertion.463\n\n\u2022 Finally, the *RREEF* tribunal agreed with other tribunals that have faced this issue and decided that the useful life of CSP plants should be considered to be 25 years, which corresponds to the claimant\u2019s initial assessments before the dispute arose.464\n\n**CE-1**, Brattle First Regulatory Report, 18 November 2016, \u00b6 23.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the Claimant\u2019s comments on *BayWa* that the findings of other tribunals regarding 25-year lifetime of other technologies are not relevant (See Eurus\u2019 comments on *BayWa*, \u00b6 11.

In the end, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, this aspect of the Disputed Measures did not breach Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 84-88, 198; Hearing Day 1, p. 71, ll 14ff (Mr. Turner).\n\nSee exchanges between Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr. Lapuerta and Spain\u2019s Counsel, Ms. Rivas Kortazar. Mr. Lapuerta recognized that the concept of standard facility was present in the renewable energy plans of 1989, 2000-2010 and 2005-2010 (Hearing Day 3, p. 83, ll 4-25, p. 84, ll 1-9 (Mr. Lapuerta)). As stated at paragraph 100 above, the PFER 1989 to PFER 2005-2010 used the concept of standard facility.\n\n***(iii) (c) \u2018Retrospectivity\u2019 and the claw-back***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Spanish courts held that the Disputed Measures were not retrospective, and that finding is entitled to some deference.467 Moreover, Spain did not claw back money actually paid above the total allowable amount of subsidies: the claw-back was in the nature of a set-off rather than a counterclaim. In the words of the Brattle First Regulatory Report:\n\nOur view is that the New Regulatory Regime reduces the remuneration to those installations that were already operating under the Original Regulatory Regime. Although technically the installations do not have to \u2018pay back any amount\u2019, reducing the future remuneration based on past gains is tantamount to asking to reimburse these gains, since the investors are being forced to offset what they have already earned against the remuneration due under the New Regulatory Regime.468\n\n**R-0154**, Constitutional Court, Judgment of 17 December 2015, 5347/2013, 7th legal ground (a) and (c); **R-0029**, Spanish Supreme Court, Judgment 22 July 2016, appeal 1964/2016. 5th and 6th Legal Grounds; **R-0002**, Supreme Court, Judgment 9 December 2009, referring to **R-0123**, Opinion of the Standing Committee of the Council of State 937/2013, of 12 September 2013 General Comment VI, Document; **R-0156**, Constitutional Court, Judgment 18 February 2016, delivered in appeal of unconstitutionality 5852/2013; **R-0157**, Constitutional Court, Judgment 18 February 2016, delivered in appeal of unconstitutionality 6031/2013. Cf the majority decision of the Supreme Court (Contentious Administrative Division), **R-0089**, Judgment 1260/2016, 1 June 2016, decided by 4-3 with illuminating dissents on the topic of retrospectivity; e.g. Judge Esp\u00edn Templado, p. 37: \u2018The system itself, however, applies as if it had been in force from the very first moment that each facility commenced its regulatory life. In my opinion that retroactive projection, which sets aside the *in tempore* application of the system in force prior to [2014], as though the latter had never existed, and the fact that the new regulation is considerably less favourable for the facilities concerned, amount to a serious abuse of judicial certainty [\u2026]\u2019.\n\n**CE-1**, Brattle First Regulatory Report, 18 November 2016, \u00b6 190.\n\n347.\n\nIn short, the Disputed Measures took into account earlier subsidies for the purpose of assessing future payments, resulting in no entitlements for 11 of the Claimant\u2019s 13 facilities. This is a weaker form of retrospectivity, but the label \u2018retrospective\u2019 is not crucial: what matters is the substance.\n\n348.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Disputed Measures were not retroactive because they did not affect acquired rights:\n\n[T]he Claimant has never had an \u2018*acquired right*\u2019 to a remuneration in the future, *sine die*, by means of a fixed and unchanging FIT, not subject to possible macroeconomic control measures or reforms of the SES. As shown above, the reform contained in RD-Act 9/2013 is only effective in the future, without affecting *acquired rights*.469\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 1056 (emphasis in original).\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees, for reasons already given, that there was no acquired right to remuneration in future, still less to \u2018a fixed and unchanging FIT\u2019. But that is not the point. It is one thing to amend payments for future production with immediate effect, and another to reduce payments that would have otherwise been made by reference to payments lawfully made in the past in respect of past production. Again, what matters is not the label \u2018retrospective\u2019 but the substance.\n\n350.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on the decision of the tribunal in *Nations Energy v. Panama*.470 That was an expropriation claim concerning substantial restrictions on the right to rely on investment tax credits under a new law, which the claimant alleged had retroactive effect, contrary to the Panamanian Constitution. The tribunal held that the claimants did not have the right that they claimed to transfer their tax credits. But even if they had such right, the new legislation did not revoke or cancel it, let alone retroactively: the claimants were still entitled to the full amount of their tax credits. Only the conditions under which they could be relied on were modified, *inter alia* by sharply lowering the annual cap. The tribunal added that the new legislation \u2018would have been retroactive [\u2026] *if it had reincorporated in the tax rate the deductions previously made*, or [\u2026] if it had disavowed existing credits.\u2019471 [Tribunal\u2019s translation]\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 972, citing **RL-0040**, *Nations Energy v. Panama*, \u00b6\u00b6 641, 642, 646.\n\n**RL-0040**, *Nations Energy v. Panama*, \u00b6 647 (emphasis added).\n\n351.\n\nThe decision concerned a situation remote from the present one: it involved an expropriation claim under a BIT, not a claim to breach of the legal stability guarantee in Article 10 of the ECT. The passage italicized above shows, however, that the distinction between immediately operative and retrospective measures is a far from simple one. There is an analogy between a law which disallows deductions already made (affecting future tax liabilities) and a law which deducts subsidies already lawfully paid from future entitlements to subsidies.\n\n352.\n\nDifferent tribunals in Spanish RE cases have reached different conclusions on the retrospectivity point. In *Charanne*, which concerned only the 2010 regulations, the tribunal rejected the retrospectivity argument, which the claimant there had presented in the form of a claim to a vested right that the regulatory framework could not be altered \u2018in any way\u2019. The tribunal formulated the question as being \u2018to what extent the State can modify, with immediate effect, generally applicable regulatory provisions.\u2019472 But although the claimant may have put it in these terms, that is not the question. The Tribunal agrees that there was no contractual right or legitimate expectation to an unchanging subsidy in any form, and it agrees that (subject to considerations of proportionality) Article 10(1) did not preclude new regulations from having immediate effect. But it is one thing to give new regulatory measures immediate effect for existing installations, and quite another to eliminate future subsidies otherwise payable by reference to amounts lawfully paid and received in earlier years on a quite different basis.\n\n**RL-0049**, *Charanne*, \u00b6 545, and see ibid, \u00b6\u00b6 546-548.\n\n353.\n\nThe *Isolux* tribunal took a similar position, also relying on *Nations Energy v. Panama*.473\n\n**RL-0024**, *Isolux*, \u00b6 814, cited in Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 974.\n\n354.\n\nThe matter was central to the decision in *RREEF*. The tribunal there emphasized that the claimants acquired a right to a \u2018general regime guaranteeing the essential advantages they could reasonably expect when they made their investments.\u2019474 Furthermore, the tribunal had \u2018no hesitation to find that the Respondent acted in breach of its obligation to respect the principle of stability\u2019 by applying the Disputed Measures retroactively.475 More precisely, according to the tribunal, the Disputed Measures took into account past remuneration under the previous regime and deducted them from future payments. This has the effect of clawing back remuneration to which the investor had a right at the time the payment was made.476\n\n**RL-0088**, *RREEF*, \u00b6 322.\n\nIbid, \u00b6 325.\n\nIbid, \u00b6\u00b6 328, 329. The tribunal was unanimous on this point.\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of this analysis477 and considers that the subsidies paid in earlier years were duly paid and duly taken into account in the operation of the SPCs, in their financing and (presumably) their taxation arrangements. To claw back those profits on the basis of a subsequent judgment that they were \u2018excessive\u2019 would seem inconsistent with the principle of stability in Article 10(1) of the ECT and has not been shown to have been necessary to resolve the tariff deficit problem, which would have been solved in any event by the Disputed Measures without much further delay and without the element of claw-back. It may have been reasonable to take into account, in calculating subsidies going forward, the 7.398% pre-tax that the Plants were deemed to be entitled to under the Disputed Measures. To count against them the amounts previously earned would be to penalise the Plants for their successful operation during those years. For these reasons, the Tribunal holds that, insofar as the claw-back operation is concerned, Spain breached Article 10(1) of the ECT.478\n\nIt may be observed that in its comment of 17 April 2019 in response to the *RREEF* decision, Spain asserts (without specifically mentioning the claw-back issue) that \u2018the statements and conclusions of the RREEF [d]ecision are applicable to this arbitration\u2019 (\u00b6 2), and refers to its \u2018correct damages approach\u2019 (\u00b6 5). The Claimant states that retroactivity was \u2018obviously a violation of [the] ECT\u2019 (Response of 29 April 2019, \u00b6 5), while arguing that there were other breaches.\n\nFor the impact of EU law, see below, \u00b6\u00b6 391-414. For the implications of this conclusion for quantum, see below, \u00b6\u00b6 415-433.\n\n***(iv) Were the Disputed Measures proportionate?***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***(iv) (a) The RREEF standard on IRR***\n----------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nTurning to the proportionality of the Disputed Measures, it is necessary to analyse their impact on the returns generated by the Claimant\u2019s investments. For reasons already given (paragraphs 354-355 above), this Tribunal agrees with the *RREEF* tribunal that the only legitimate expectation the Claimant could have had was that of a \u2018reasonable return\u2019 in terms of the 1997 Law.479 In particular, the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant had a legitimate expectation to the regime of RD 661/2007, which (a) was not in force when all but the most recent investments were made by the Claimant, (b) was not the subject of a stabilization regime, and (c) was subordinate to the 1997 Law.\n\n**RL-0088**, *RREEF*, \u00b6\u00b6 470, 521.\n\n357.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the decision in *RREEF* that the Claimant is entitled to compensation for unreasonable return on their investments \u2013 if established \u2013 [\u2026] [but] cannot claim full compensation for the total decrease in their profits as a result of the adoption of the new regime by the Respondent; they can only get compensation to the extent that such decrease is below the threshold of a reasonable return.480\n\n**RL-0088**, *RREEF*, \u00b6 523.\n\n358.\n\nThe *RREEF* tribunal conducted its proportionality analysis under the rubric \u2018The Principle of Damages\u2019 in the section of its Decision dealing with quantum. It did so on the ground that \u2018the determination of a violation of the principles of proportionality and reasonableness is inseparable from an assessment of the damages \u2013 if any \u2013 endured by the Claimants as a consequence of the measures taken by the Respondent.\u2019481 The two are closely connected in practice, but nonetheless the question of disproportionality pertains to the merits \u2013 whether there has been a breach in the first place \u2013 and not to issues of quantum, which are consequential. This difference of principle is important in practice because it is only if the breach is identified with precision that the question of reparation for that breach can be approached.\n\nIbid, \u00b6 472.\n\n359.\n\nIt is notable that the Parties and their experts treated the question of quantum in an essentially undifferentiated way, as the amount of loss suffered by the Claimant as a result of the Disputed Measures globally. That led them to identify the amount of reparation owing by reference to an undifferentiated \u2018but for\u2019 situation.482 For the Claimant\u2019s experts this was the *status quo ante*, the regime of RD 661/2007.483 But if the Claimant had no right to the continuation of that regime, it cannot have acquired any such right by reference to the secondary rules of reparation. The venerable dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* does not guarantee the continuation of a factual situation (the Special Regime) to which the Claimant was not otherwise entitled.484\n\nCf **CL-0116**, *Greentech*, \u00b6\u00b6 537, 538 on the undifferentiated character of claims against the Disputed Measures.\n\nIn CE-5, the Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, the Claimant\u2019s expert puts forward two alternative valuations. In the Rebuttal Quantum Report, \u00b6\u00b6 175ff, Brattle changed 6 incorrect parameters used in BDO\u2019s alternative DCF calculation, the most important of which was the application of RD 661/2007\u2019s tariffs, this change alone increases BDO\u2019s assessment of damages from EUR -1 million to EUR 126 million. Furthermore, in the Rebuttal Quantum Report, \u00b6\u00b6 208ff, Brattle assessed the amount of damages that the Claimant would be entitled to in an alternative scenario, where the Claimant would have been entitled to a reasonable return instead of fixed tariffs. Brattle calculated an alternative but-for scenario with a 7% after tax return over a 20-year regulatory useful life period. Brattle then calculated an alternative tariff per MWh produced and applied it to the production forecasted to each SPC. Based on that methodology, Brattle offers two alternative figures: a) damages for EUR 237 million, assuming a but-for scenario where the same tariff applies to all plants; b) damages for EUR 120 million, assuming different tariffs per MWh produced by each SPC, based on the remuneration code assigned to each SPC under the New Regime. This second scenario accepts most of Spain\u2019s assumptions for the calculation of damages.\n\n**CL-0054**, *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Permanent Court of International Justice, Judgment No. 13), Claim for Indemnity \u2013 Merits, 13 September 1928, p. 8.\n\n360.\n\nThe question thus becomes whether the Disputed Measures operated\n\nin a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.485\n\n**CL-0083**, *Blusun*, \u00b6 372, endorsed in **RL-0088**, *RREEF*, \u00b6 547.\n\n361.\n\nTo examine the proportionality of the Disputed Measures, the Tribunal agrees with the *RREEF* tribunal that the relevant measure is the internal rate of return (\u2018**IRR**\u2019):\n\nSince the Tribunal has determined that the only legitimate expectation of which the Claimants could prevail themselves was that of a \u2018reasonable return\u2019, it is appropriate to compare both regimes depending on the IRR that the Claimants can get under each of them. As the *Novenergia* tribunal put it, \u2018the internal rates of return is a relevant measurement for what the Claimant was expecting to get from its investment in the Kingdom of Spain at the time of making the investment.\u2019486\n\n**RL-0088**, *RREEF*, \u00b6 521, citing **CL-0112**, *Novenergia II*, \u00b6 826.\n\n362.\n\nAccording to the Respondent\u2019s experts, the IRR equates to the \u2018reasonable return\u2019 as provided for by the provisions of the Spanish regulatory regime.487 Investors take the IRR into account and compare it to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to decide on the profitability of a potential investment. If the project IRR is higher than the required rate of return it follows that the cash flows generated by the investment will cover the costs associated with the project.488 In principle, the Tribunal agrees with this assessment. If the project IRR exceeds a reasonable return, the Disputed Measures would be proportionate and would not breach Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n**RE-1**, Expert Report of BDO, 11 April 2017, \u00b6 135.\n\n**RE-2**, Second Expert Report of BDO, 21 December 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 185ff.\n\n***(iv) (b) The project IRR under Spain\u2019s Special Regime***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nAs stated by the Parties, there is a difference between the project IRR and the shareholder IRR. Whereas the ECT protects shareholders\u2019 rights and accords different protection standards to them, the Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the relevant IRR targeted by the notion of legitimate expectation to a reasonable return is the project IRR over the useful lifetime of the plants.\n\n364.\n\nYet the Parties do not agree on the project IRR under the Special Regime. This Tribunal needs not determine the exact IRR before the entry into force of the Disputed Measures. Nonetheless, it notes that the IRR under the new incentives regime is lower than under the initial regime, and not surprisingly. As already held by the Tribunal, the Respondent has the right to modify and amend its regulations, *i.e.* the amount of the targeted IRR, as long as they remain reasonable and do not breach the ECT.\n\n365.\n\nThe *RREEF* tribunal calculated a reasonable rate of return at 6.86% including a 1% supplementary premium.489 That is well below the Claimant\u2019s IRR in the present case, even if all of Brattle\u2019s criticisms of BDO\u2019s IRR analysis are accepted.\n\n**RL-0088**, *RREEF*, \u00b6\u00b6 588, 589.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal does not take any position on the exact amount of the reasonable return. This return can change over time depending on various factors. The Respondent emphasizes that the reasonable return is a \u2018dynamic\u2019 concept.490 The Tribunal agrees. The term \u2018reasonable\u2019 allows the state to accommodate a change in these factors instead of fixing the IRR at a certain number. Nonetheless, the Tribunal notes that even if the Claimant had a legitimate expectation of an IRR of 6.86%, the actual IRR clearly exceeded that amount.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 356.\n\n367.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 positions as to the project IRR are set out in the table below:491\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Plant** | **BDO Actual****IRR** | **Brattle****Corrected****Actual IRR** | **But-For according to Brattle IRR** |\n| Paxareiras | 19.3% | 13.2% | 15.3% |\n| Vicedo | 13.5% | 10.5% | 12.5% |\n| A Ru\u00f1a | 19.8% | 16.7% | 18.4% |\n| Virxe do Monte | 16.7% | 13.7% | 15.7% |\n| Adra\u00f1o | 16.5% | 14.1% | 16.5% |\n| Ameixenda y Filgueira | 14.8% | 12.8% | 15.7% |\n| BSI | 14.6% | 12.8% | 15.9% |\n| Curr\u00e1s | 20.9% | 24.7% | 26.2% |\n| Deva | 12.3% | 10.5% | 14.6% |\n| Tea | 11.7% | 10.3% | 14.2% |\n| Buio | 10.0% | 8.8% | 12.2% |\n| Abara | 7.0% | 6.1% | 8.6% |\n| Barbanza | 17.9% | 13.5% | 14.7% |\n|  |\n| **Total** | **15.1%** | **12.5%** | **14.5%** |\n\n**CE-5**, Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, 29 September 2017, \u00b6 70; BDO Workpaper F -financial model.\n\n368.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties do not agree on the total project IRR. However, it is not in dispute that the actual return targeted by the Disputed Measures is a 7.398% pre-tax project IRR.492 According to Brattle\u2019s Rebuttal Report and BDO Workpaper F, the total IRR after the enactment of the Disputed Measures as calculated by BDO is 15.1%.493 The total IRR as calculated by Brattle is 12.5%. The average of both numbers is 13.8%, which is well above the 7.398% target of the Spanish regulator.\n\n**RE-1**, Expert Report of BDO, 11 April 2017, \u00b6 134; **CE-5**, Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, 29 September 2017, \u00b6 52.\n\n**CE-5**, Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, 29 September 2017, \u00b6 70; BDO Workpaper F -financial model.\n\n369.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides that the Respondent has not breached its obligation to ensure a reasonable return. Thus, the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectation to a reasonable return has not been frustrated.\n\n**C. SPAIN\u2019S ALLEGED BREACH OF ARTICLE 10(1) OF THE ECT, THIRD SENTENCE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that the Disputed Measures unreasonably impaired Claimant\u2019s investment, in breach of Article 10(1) third sentence, of the ECT, which provides in relevant part that the investments:\n\n[\u2026] shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.494\n\n**CL-0001**, ECT, Art. 10(1).\n\n**(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a.

Argentina*, where the tribunal held that:\n\nUnilateral withdrawal by Argentina of [the] key components of the Regulatory Framework was from the perspective of the [applicable treaty] unreasonable and it was therefore in breach of [the treaty\u2019s unreasonable measures clause].496\n\n**CL-0047**, *BG Group Plc v.

It argues that the Disputed Measures withdraw key components of the Special Regime and reduced the value of the investment by two-thirds. As a result, the Disputed Measures impaired the investment in an unreasonable way.497\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 291.\n\n374.\n\nThe Claimant also rejects the Respondent\u2019s arguments.

Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 259-295.\n\n375.\n\nAs to Spain\u2019s first argument, the Claimant responds that the Disputed Measures were not necessary to solve the issues arising out of the tariff deficit because the payment of subsidies did not threaten the sustainability of Spain\u2019s electricity system.499 An alternative solution would have been to raise electricity prices.500 Furthermore, Spain cannot rely on changes in the interest rates on government bonds to argue necessity because there were no relevant changes.501\n\nCl.

The costs when making the investment were different from current costs (they were much higher), and therefore current rates of investment were irrelevant for existing investors such as Eurus.507\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 294, 295.\n\n***b. The Respondent***\n-----------------------\n\n378.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Disputed Measures were not discriminatory, unreasonable or disproportionate. In rejecting the claim, the Respondent makes three points.\n\n379.\n\nFirst, the Claimant has the burden of proof of a breach of Article 10(1) third sentence, and, Spain argues, Eurus has failed to meet the standard of proof.508 The worsening of the tariff deficit, required the Respondent to take necessary steps to resolve the situation. The Respondent points also to the principle of sustainability of the SES, the worsening of the economic crisis, the exceptional decline in electricity demand, the existence of overcompensation in the RE sector, and Spain\u2019s bail-out commitments undertaken with the EU. Thus, according to Spain, the measures were reasonable in the circumstances to address the tariff deficit and rebalance the system.509\n\nResp. C.-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1069-1076.\n\nResp. C.-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1069-1080; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 796-799.\n\n380.\n\nSecond, not only did APPA endorse the Disputed Measures but so did most domestic and foreign investors. For example, the Disputed Measures\u2019 remuneration system was in line with that proposed by APPA in the 2009 Draft Law. Also, international organizations made positive assessments of the Disputed Measures. This evidences that the Disputed Measures were a reasonable and proportionate response in the circumstances.510\n\nResp. C.-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1081-1087.\n\n381.\n\nFinally, the Respondent relies on statements of the tribunals in *EDF v. Romania*,511*AES Summit v. Hungary*512 and *Total v. Argentina*513 to support the conclusion that the Disputed Measures were neither discriminatory nor unreasonable.514\n\n**RL-0035**, *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13), Award, 8 October 2009, \u00b6 303.\n\n**RL-0039**, *AES Summit v. Hungary*, \u00b6\u00b6 10.3.7-10.3.9.\n\n**RL-0050**, *Total v. Argentina*, \u00b6 122.\n\nResp. C.-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1091-1121.\n\n382.\n\nRelying on *EDF v. Romania*, Spain submits that the Disputed Measures are compliant with the FET standard because they were (i) adopted to serve the legitimate purpose of solving the imbalance created by the tariff deficit, without burdening consumers in the midst of an economic crisis; (ii) based on the legal standards set out in the applicable regulatory framework and the jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court, and were not on prejudice or personal preference; (iii) adopted to guarantee sustainability, a reason stated in the regulatory framework; and (iv) adopted following due process.\n\n383.\n\nRelying on *AES Summit v. Hungary*, Spain argues that the Disputed Measures are a reasonable response to a public policy objective. They formed macroeconomic control measures to reduce the tariff deficit and ensure the sustainability of the SES. According to Spain, the tribunal in *Eiser v. Spain* supported this view.515 In *Total v. Argentina*, the tribunal found that in sectors involving long-term investment with large amounts of capital, a state\u2019s change of its legal framework complies with the FET standard if the investor can recover its operational costs, amortize its investment and obtain a reasonable rate of return. According to Spain, these criteria are met, since the Disputed Measures affected all operators, offering a reasonable return of 7.398% before tax, in line with Spain\u2019s public policy objectives.516\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 805, referring to **RL-0071**, *Eiser*, \u00b6 371.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1113-1118, referring to **RL-0050**, *Total v. Argentina*, \u00b6 122.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nUnder Article 10(1) third sentence of the ECT, States have to provide on constant protection and security while also ensuring that \u2018the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of the investment is not impaired by unreasonable or discriminatory measures\u2019.\n\n385.\n\nArticle 10(1) third sentence appears to have a twofold sense. In the first place, it obliges the state to ensure the physical protection of the investment, safeguarding it against violence and harassment; in this respect, at least, it is not a re-statement of the fair and equitable treatment standard in different words. This was the view of similar clauses taken by numerous tribunals, including *Noble Ventures v. Romania*,517*Tecmed v. Mexico*,518*APL v. Sri Lanka*,519*Wena Hotels v. Egypt*,520*AMT v. Zaire*521 and *Eureko v. Poland*.522\n\n*Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11), Award, 12 October 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 164-167.\n\n**CL-0024**, *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award, 29 May 2003, \u00b6\u00b6 175-182.\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. v. Republic of Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3), Award, 27 June 1990, \u00b6\u00b6 45-86.\n\n**CL-0088**, *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Award, 8 December 2000, \u00b6 84.\n\n*American Manufacturing & Trading, Inc. v. Republic of* Zaire (ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1), Award, 21 February 1997, \u00b6\u00b6 6.02ff.\n\n**CL-0032**, *Eureko B.V. v. Republic of Poland*, Partial Award, 19 August 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 236, 237.\n\n386.\n\nHere there is no evidence that Eurus\u2019s investment has suffered from any physical harm or deterioration through the Disputed Measures and Eurus has not suggested otherwise. Moreover, there is no evidence that Eurus\u2019s management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of the wind plants, as distinct from its income and thus its value, have been impaired by the change of the Incentives Regime.\n\n387.\n\nSecondly, the provision expressly refers to unreasonable or discriminatory measures. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, unreasonable or discriminatory measures in the general sense are examples of measures that breach the FET standard as contained in Article 10(1), first and second sentences. It agrees with the tribunal in *RREEF*, which analysed the alleged discriminatory character of the Disputed Measures and issues of proportionality and reasonableness as part of the FET claim.523 The *RREEF* tribunal decided that:\n\n[T]here can be no doubt that [\u2026], (iii) non-impairment including (iv) non-discrimination and (v) proportionality and reasonableness, are elements of the FET \u2013 and certainly so under the ECT.524\n\n**RL-0088**, *RREEF*, pp. 136ff. and 145ff.\n\nIbid, \u00b6 260.\n\n388.\n\nNo conclusive evidence was provided to necessitate a finding of unreasonableness or discrimination under those elements of the FET standard, save insofar as the retro-active aspect of the Disputed Measures, in the form of the claw-back clause is concerned. In absence of any persuasive argument to the contrary, no separate finding of unreasonableness or discrimination under Article 10(1), third sentence, can be made.\n\n389.\n\nIn the light of the above, nothing further remains to be decided as regards the claim under Article 10(1), third sentence, of the ECT.\n\n**(3) Conclusions on Article 10(1) of the ECT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunal concludes that to the extent the Disputed Measures were applied clawing back subsidies paid before their adoption, they form a breach of Article 10(1) first and second sentence of the ECT. In all other respects, no breach has occurred. But, as already noted (paragraphs 235-236 above), this conclusion concerns the ECT in the absence of EU law, notably the EU rules concerning state aid. To this the Tribunal turns.\n\n**D. THE EU STATE AID ARGUMENTS**\n---------------------------------\n\n**(1) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n391.\n\nAccording to Spain, EU law has a specific relevance to the claim, in that EU state aid law, which is part of Spanish law, has the effect that the Claimant did not have, and could not have had, any legitimate expectation of receiving Special Regime subsidies, still less that they were fixed at the level of RD 661/2007.525 Moreover, Spain argues that the EC\u2019s decision of 10 November 2017 authorizing the Disputed Measures as permissible state aid526 entails that compliance with any award of this Tribunal requiring Spain to make payments in excess of those provided by those Measures would itself constitute impermissible state aid and would trigger the stand-still obligation in Article 108(3) of the TFEU.527\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 66.\n\n**RL-0073**, EC decision of 10 November 2017.\n\nFor the Respondent\u2019s arguments on state aid see e.g. Resp.

Therefore, in accordance with the consistent jurisprudence of the CJEU, the Claimant could not have had any legitimate expectation that the incentives regime was lawful. This entailed that the Claimant could not have the legitimate expectation that aid be granted.530\n\nEuropean Commission, Application for leave to intervene as non-disputing party, 5 November 2018, \u00b6\u00b6 38-41.\n\n395.\n\nFinally, the EC reiterated that if Spain were to comply with an award in favour of the Claimant, the payment would constitute state aid under Article 108(3) of the TFEU and would be subject to the standstill obligation.531\n\nIbid, \u00b6\u00b6 46-51.\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s response***\n--------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nThe Claimant puts forward three reasons to reject the argument that it could not have developed any legitimate expectations in the matter due to the incompatibility of the Special Regime with EU law on state aid. First, Spain itself never considered the Special Regime to constitute state aid. Second, the possibility that the Special Regime under the 1997 Act could have been reviewed by the EC or the CJEU does not mean that the Claimant cannot rely on the regime until it has been reviewed (which never happened). Third, the state aid issue played no role in Spain\u2019s decision to introduce the Disputed Measures and the risk, in the event unrealised, that subsidies paid under the Special Regime could be considered unlawful state aid and recovered as such did not render the Claimant\u2019s expectations under the ECT illegitimate.532\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments on the European Commission\u2019s Request to intervene, 31 January 2019, \u00b6 3.\n\n397.\n\nAs to the first reason, Spain aggressively promoted the RE Special Regime, stressing the EC\u2019s support of the scheme to attract investors. To all appearances, neither Spain nor the EC believed that the Special Regime could be contrary to EU law, and neither of them acted on that view. The Claimant maintains that by not notifying the regime to the EC, Spain in effect communicated to the investors that the incentives regime was lawful under EU law. Furthermore, the Claimant conducted due diligence as required under the ECT and international law. Although that due diligence did not address EU law on state aid, that very fact (according to the Claimant) is itself consistent with Spain\u2019s and the EC\u2019s initial view that this was not state aid.533\n\nIbid, \u00b6\u00b6 4-17.\n\n398.\n\nAs to the second reason, the Claimant argues that the fact that a measure can be reviewed through domestic processes, including the EC, does not mean that the Claimant cannot rely on that measure. In support, the Claimant refers to the decision in *SPP v. Egypt*, in which the tribunal held that:\n\nIt is possible that under Egyptian law certain acts of Egyptian officials [\u2026] may be considered legally nonexistent or null and void or susceptible to invalidation. However, these acts were cloaked with the mantle of Governmental authority and communicated as such to foreign investors who relied on them in making their investments.\n\nWhether legal under Egyptian law or not, the acts in question were the acts of Egyptian authorities, including the highest executive authority of the Government. These acts, which are now alleged to have been in violation of the Egyptian municipal legal system, created expectations protected by established principles of international law. A determination that these acts are null and void under municipal law would not resolve the ultimate question of liability for damages suffered by the victim who relied on the acts.534\n\n**CL-0016**, *SPP v. Egypt*, \u00b6\u00b6 82, 83. Also relevant there was the finding that the Egyptian authorities subsequently and repeatedly authorised the location of the project: ibid, \u00b6\u00b6 96-99.\n\n399.\n\nSimilarly, by its conduct in promoting and repeatedly affirming the Special Regime, Spain nurtured the Claimant\u2019s expectations as to its lawfulness, and the availability of a review mechanism at EU level does not render those expectations illegitimate.535\n\nClaimant\u2019s Comments on the European Commission\u2019s Request to intervene, 31 January 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 18-21.\n\n400.\n\nThird, the Claimant argues that the fact that the EC could have declared the Special Regime incompatible with EU law is of no importance since this did not happen. For 15 years, Spain did not question the lawfulness of the Special Regime. Even if the Claimant had considered the Special Regime to constitute illegal state aid (which it did not), Spain would still be responsible for any damage caused to the Claimant\u2019s investment, because it would then have failed to provide stable, favourable and transparent conditions for Eurus\u2019s investment.536\n\nIbid, \u00b6\u00b6 22-26.\n\n401.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that an award in Eurus\u2019s favour would not constitute unlawful state aid. This is because by not enforcing such an award, the EU and its member states would violate their obligations under the ECT.537\n\nIbid, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s response***\n----------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nSpain stresses two points in relation to the state aid issue, while generally endorsing the EC\u2019s position.\n\n403.\n\nFirst, Spain reiterates that the Claimant did not have and could not have any legitimate expectations of receiving Special Regime subsidies. The EC has declared the incentives regime to constitute state aid.538 The consequence of this declaration, which is binding on the Tribunal under the applicable law, is not the repayment of the subsidies to Spain but the exclusion of any legitimate expectations to the payment of the state aid.539 Therefore, the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations have not been breached.540\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on the European Commission\u2019s Request to intervene, 31 January 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 11-14.\n\nIbid, \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.\n\nIbid, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.\n\n404.\n\nSecond, Spain emphasises that the EC expressly stated in its decision of 10 November 2017 that any compensation awarded to the Claimant would constitute unauthorised state aid pursuant to Article 108(3) of the TFEU. On that basis, an award in Eurus\u2019s favour could not be enforced, at least within the EU.541\n\nIbid, \u00b6 10.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on state aid**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n***a. EU law on state aid***\n----------------------------\n\n405.\n\nThe analysis that follows is adopted by majority. Arbitrator Garibaldi concurs in the decision to the extent that EU rules on state aid are not an impediment to the Claimant\u2019s claims but dissents in respect of other aspects of the majority\u2019s conclusion and the supporting reasoning. The reasons for the dissent are set forth in his Partial Dissenting Opinion.\n\n406.\n\nThe Tribunal will first summarise what it understands, on the basis of the submissions of the parties and the EC\u2019s request to intervene as a non-party, and the referenced documents, to be the relevant rules of EU state aid law.\n\n407.\n\nArticle 107(1) of the TFEU provides that:\n\n[A]ny aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market.\n\n408.\n\nThere are certain exceptions to the prohibition in Article 107(1), none of them relevant here.\n\n409.\n\nArticle 107(3) sets out criteria to be applied by the EC in approving state aid proposals. If a proposal is not approved, it must be withdrawn or duly modified, an injunction enforceable by the CJEU (Article 108(2)).\n\n410.\n\nArticle 108(1) requires the EC, in cooperation with member states, to \u2018keep under constant review all systems of aid existing in those States\u2019. In accordance with Article 108(3):\n\nThe Commission shall be informed [\u2026] of any plans to grant or alter aid. If it considers that any such plan is not compatible with the internal market having regard to Article 107, it shall without delay initiate the procedure provided for in paragraph 2. The Member State concerned shall not put its proposed measures into effect until this procedure has resulted in a final decision.\n\n411.\n\nAccording to these provisions, state aid which is not notified under Article 108(3), or which is implemented before it is authorised by the EC, is unlawful. Unlawful aid can and in principle should be recovered, as the EC can require its repayment by all recipients to the granting state. But the failure to notify aid, though it makes the aid unlawful, does not entail that the EC may not subsequently find the aid compatible with the internal market: this is what happened with the Disputed Measures, which were notified by Spain only after their implementation. In approving them in its decision of 10 November 2017, the EC confined itself to \u2018lamenting\u2019 the late notification.542 It could have ordered the payment of interest on amounts paid prior to the approval date but did not do so.\n\n**RL-0073**, EC decision of 10 November 2017, p. 33.\n\n412.\n\nThe question whether particular payments constitute aid under EU law is a matter for the EC, national courts, and ultimately the CJEU. The onus lies primarily on the state, whose obligation it is to notify its (planned) aid measures, but also the recipient can be expected to ascertain whether the measures have been notified, which it can do by consulting the on-line register of aid.543 Moreover, it is well established that:\n\n[S]o long as the Commission has not taken a decision approving aid, and so long as the period for bringing an action against such a decision has not expired, the recipient cannot be sure as to the lawfulness of the proposed aid which alone is capable of giving rise to a legitimate expectation on his part.544\n\nEC register of state aid decisions: http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state\\_aid/register/.\n\nCase C-199/06, *Centre d\u2019exportation du livre fran\u00e7ais v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 internationale de diffusion et d\u2019\u00e9dition*, 12 February 2008 (GC), \u00b6 67, citing Case C-91/01 *Italy v. Commission* [2004] ECR I-4355, \u00b6 66.\n\n413.\n\nThis principle is of long-standing. For example, in 1997, the Court held:\n\n[I]n view of the mandatory nature of the supervision of State aid by the Commission under Article 93 [now 108] of the Treaty, undertakings to which an aid has been granted cannot, in principle, entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has been granted in compliance with the procedure laid down in that article. A diligent operator should normally be able to determine whether that procedure has been followed.545\n\nCase C-169/95, *Kingdom of Spain v. Commission*, \u00b6 51, citing earlier authority.\n\n414.\n\nIn the EU state aid context, the relevance of legitimate expectations is that they can, in certain limited circumstances, constitute a defence to a claim for repayment of aid.546\n\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, Art. 14.\n\n***b. The application of state aid law to the Special Regime***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n415.\n\nThe Claimant argues that neither Spain nor the EC initially considered Special Regime subsidies to constitute state aid. Nevertheless, the two Directives on Renewable Energy of 2001 and 2009 both expressly refer to Articles 87-88 TFEU,547 and the EC, in implementing these Directives, has approved a large number of subsidies schemes for renewable energy. The matter was put by the EC in 2005 in the following terms:\n\nAs stated in indent 12 of the pre-amble of Directive 2001/77/EC, the rules of the Treaty, and in particular Articles 87 and 88 thereof, apply to public support. Such support is normally covered by the Community Guidelines on State aid for Environmental Protection and might be economically justified on a number of grounds as the beneficial effects of such measures on the environment outweigh the distorting effects on competition. Since the use of renewable energy sources is a priority in the policy of the Community, the mentioned guidelines are rather generous for such support schemes. On that basis, some 60 State aid schemes supporting renewable energy sources were approved by the Commission during the period 2001 to 2004.548\n\nSee **RL-0015**, Directive 2001/77/EC, 27 September 2001, preambular \u00b6 (12), \u00b6 4 (support schemes \u2018[w]ithout prejudice to Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty\u2019); **RL-0017**, Directive 2009/28/EC, 23 April 2009, \u00b6 3 (support schemes \u2018[w]ithout prejudice to Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty\u2019).\n\n**BRR-130**, EC Report, Communication From The Commission - The Support of Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources, COM(2005) 627 final, 7 December 2005, \u00b6 3.5; **RL-0095**, *BayWa*, \u00b6 562.\n\n416.\n\nIn fact, it does not appear that *any* green energy subsidy scheme was disapproved by the EC during this period. The EC register of state aid lists only five negative decisions, involving Austria (2011549), France (2016550 and 2018551) and Germany (2015552 and 2018553). None of these schemes bore any resemblance to the Spanish Special Regime in force up to 2013.\n\nSA.26036, 8 March 2011 (part of scheme only disapproved), EC decision upheld by General Court, T-251/11, 11 December 2014.\n\nSA.39621, 8 November 2016 (amended scheme approved).\n\nSA.36511, 31 July 2018 (amended scheme approved).\n\nSA.33995, 5 August 2015 (part of scheme only disapproved). On 29 March 2019, the European Court of Justice set aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 10 May 2016, *Germany v. Commission* (T\u201147/15, EU:T:2016:281) and annulled Commission Decision (EU) 2015/1585 of 25 November 2014 in State aid proceedings: CJEU, 2019/C-187/04.\n\nSA.45852, 17 October 2018.\n\n417.\n\nThus, it appears to have been the case that state aid rules were in principle applicable, but that the EC took a \u2018rather generous\u2019 approach to their application,554 consistent with the Guidelines on Renewable Energy.\n\nAccording to uncontradicted evidence of Claimant\u2019s expert Mr. Carlos Lapuerta:  \n[T]he original regime was not notified to the Commission as state aid at the time. It\u2019s not the only one that wasn\u2019t notified at the time. But in total \u2013 I\u2019ve counted \u2013 there are 90 different applications for approval by different European countries submitting renewable energy support schemes for approval by the Commission, and there have been 90 approvals granted. And some of those approvals occurred in the same timeframe as RD 661/2007 was passed, and some of those approvals included regimes that were offering higher returns than Spain offered, and regimes that explicitly grandfathered existing plant from further reviews. So this was just not an issue of concern at the time.  \nHearing Day 3, p. 141, ll 17-25 \u2013 p. 142, ll 1-5 (Mr. Lapuerta).\n\n418.\n\nIt may be pointed out that Spain itself notified certain proposed schemes to the EC under Article 88. The first such notification seems to have been in 2003, well before RD 661/2007.555\n\nN 132/2003 was a notification by Spain in 2003 of a proposed state aid regime involving the regional government of Navarra. The proposed scheme consisted in direct subsidies to cover up to 40% of the investment costs of renewable energy facilities below 100 KW located in Navarra. The EC raised no objection to the scheme.\n\n419.\n\nAs to whether the Special Regime subsidies constitute state aid as defined, the Claimant confined itself to arguing, without further elaboration or documentary support, that at the time of the investment, both Parties and the EC assumed that they did not. Nevertheless, the Guidelines of 2001 point in a contrary direction. Although the cost of the subsidies was intended to be met by consumers, the Spanish state provided for them by law and was closely involved in the operation of the system. In its decision of 10 November 2017, the EC held that the Disputed Measures constituted state aid, and by parity of reasoning so did the Special Regime. The CJEU\u2019s decision in *PreussenElektra*, which is sometimes cited in this context, seems plainly distinguishable.556 The Tribunal concludes that the Special Regime constituted state aid as defined and should have been notified to the EC under Article 108 of the TFEU.\n\n*PreussenElektra AG v. Schleswag AG*, CJEU 2001/C-379/98 (GC), 13 March 2001. This related to a subsidy scheme managed and funded by the private sector without the use of state resources.\n\n420.\n\nThe Claimant points out that the EC never condemned the Special Regime subsidies as state aid, still less did it require their repayment by the large number of recipients of subsidies.557 The Respondent asserts that it follows from the EC\u2019s 2017 decision on the Disputed Measures that the Claimant can have had no legitimate expectation of receiving subsidies in excess of those provided for by those Measures, or indeed at all.558\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 28.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 673-677.\n\n421.\n\nIn its Decision of 10 November 2017, the EC held that payments made under the Disputed Measures from their inception in 2014 until 10 November 2017 were state aid and, not having been notified, were unlawful.559 After examination, it decided that the aid was compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107(3)(c) of the TFEU. As for existing facilities, \u2018payments under the premium economic scheme are covered by the decision in order to assess proportionality, *i.e.* the absence of overcompensation.\u2019560 But it was \u2018not relevant for the scope of this decision to assess whether the originally foreseen payments under the previous schemes would have been compatible or not.\u2019561\n\n**RL-0073**, EC decision of 10 November 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 84-89.\n\nIbid, \u00b6 4.\n\nIbid, \u00b6 156.\n\n422.\n\nA separate question for the Tribunal is the relevance, if any, of the EC\u2019s intimation or decision that compliance with any damages award in the present case would by itself constitute notifiable state aid, subject to the standstill obligation.562 In this regard the Tribunal agrees with the *Vattenfall* tribunal:\n\nWhile the Tribunal is mindful of the duty to render an enforceable decision and ultimately an enforceable award, the Tribunal is equally conscious of its duty to perform its mandate granted under the ECT [\u2026] The enforceability of this decision is a separate matter which does not impinge upon the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.563\n\nIbid, \u00b6 165.\n\n*Vattenfall AB v. Federal Republic of Germany* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12), Decision on the *Achmea* Issue, 31 August 2018, \u00b6 230.\n\n423.\n\nTurning to the substantive question of the interaction of EU law with the ECT, the following observations should be made:\n\n(a) In principle, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation of treatment which is unlawful under the law of the host state, provided that the host state law itself is not acting inconsistently with the treaty under which the tribunal exercises its jurisdiction.564 In an international forum such as the present one, a host state may not rely on its domestic law as a ground for non-fulfilment of its international obligations.565 Investors, for their part, are under an obligation to conduct a due diligence assessment prior to investment to acquaint themselves with the applicable host state law and form their legitimate expectations accordingly.\n\n(b) In the present case, the host state\u2019s law itself (incorporating EU state aid rules) is not inconsistent with the ECT, under which the tribunal exercises its jurisdiction. Although arguably harsh on recipients as they risk bearing the harmful consequences of the subsidizing state\u2019s omission to notify the aid, the EU rules in regard of non-notified aid are clear and have been consistently interpreted. From the standpoint of international law, \u2018municipal laws are merely facts which express the will and constitute the activities of States, in the same manner as do legal decisions or administrative measures.\u2019566 The Tribunal therefore does not interpret EU law as such, but accepts the consistent interpretation of EU law as applied by the relevant institutions.\n\nSee **RL-0074**, *Blusun*, \u00b6\u00b6 264-268; **RL-0078**, *Yukos*, \u00b6 1352; **RL-0034**, *Plama v. Bulgaria*, \u00b6\u00b6 138, 140, 143.\n\nILC, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts 2001, Art. 3.\n\n*Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v. Poland)*, 1926 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 7, \u00b6 52.\n\n424.\n\nThe initial investments at issue in the present case were made in 1997, after a due diligence process that had no regard to EU state aid law.567 As it is at least arguable that state aid law should have been seen as relevant even at that time, the Tribunal finds this omission surprising.\n\nAs admitted by the Claimant\u2019s due diligence witness, Mr. Matsuoka, in response to questions from the Tribunal. See Hearing Day 2, p. 23, ll 2-10 (Mr. Matsuoka):  \nTHE PRESIDENT: [\u2026] Were you advised by Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez of the potential issue of state aid in relation to the incentive regime?  \nA: No, I did not. I did not receive any such advice.  \nTHE PRESIDENT: Did you have any awareness that there was a state aid regime applicable to investments in the European Union?  \nA: No, I did not at that time. However, after I left Eurus, I became aware of such issue.\n\n425.\n\nThe EC, which has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing state aid law, was well-informed as to the Spanish special subsidy regime in its various manifestations under the 1997 Law. Indeed, it extolled the Special Regime as \u2018the main driver for investment in wind energy\u2019 and as \u2018rather well adjusted to generation cost\u2019.568 There is no indication that it did anything to raise with Spain the state aid issue until the Disputed Measures were belatedly raised by Spain itself in December 2014, well after the cessation of Special Regime subsidies and the repeal of the 1997 Law.\n\n**BRR-130**, EC Report, Communication from The Commission - The Support of Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources, COM (2005) 627 final, 7 December 2005, p. 28; **RL-0095**, *BayWa*, \u00b6 569(d).\n\n426.\n\nSpain, an EU member since 1986, ought to have been aware of its notification duty under Article 108(3) of the TFEU and should have acted accordingly. There is, however, no causal link between the omission to notify and the fact that the Claimant has not continued to receive the amount of subsidies provided for in RD 661/2007. The illegality of unnotified Special Regime subsidies played no role in subsequent events, including the enactment of the Disputed Measures, which were driven by purely domestic concerns, notably the tariff deficit.\n\n427.\n\nDespite its detailed knowledge of the Special Regime, the EC for its part has taken no steps to enforce the relevant provisions of EU law against the recipients of subsidies generally. Instead it has elected to try or threaten to block the payment of any award of ECT and BIT tribunals, including this Tribunal, as constituting *de novo* a form of state aid. It will be for the parties through subsequent proceedings to work through the consequences of the Tribunal\u2019s award under EU law and international law, including by reference to the provisions of the ICSID Convention concerning the status and enforcement of awards.569 The Tribunal can do nothing but decide the present case in accordance with the applicable law.\n\nCf *Altmark Trans GmbH et al. v. Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Altmark GmbH*, Case C-280/00, Judgment, ECJ, 24 July 2003; **CL-0104**, *Asteris and others v. Greece and Commission of the European Communities*, Case C-106/87, Judgment, ECJ, 27 September 1988.\n\n428.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal finds by majority that under EU law and the law of Spain, the Claimant could not legitimately have expected that the Special Regime subsidies were, for certain, lawful. Even if the subsidies were lawful, it could not expect, under EU law and the law of Spain, that the amount of state aid granted under these measures would be paid for the lifetime of the plants. The Claimant should have known that these measures had not been notified to, let alone approved by, the EC.\n\n429.\n\nHowever, the EC has equally not rendered a decision that the Special Regime subsidies were unlawful. It merely stated, with full knowledge of the facts, that it was \u2018not relevant\u2019 whether the previous scheme was compatible with EU law. As such, the EC has not created a right (still less a duty) for Spain to procure the reimbursement of amounts of state aid already paid, including to the Claimant\u2019s wind farms and other recipients. Nor, in the light of the record, does the Tribunal believe that EU law required only the level of subsidy provided by the Disputed Measures. The EC, which has quite broad discretion in such matters, made no such finding.\n\n430.\n\nThe Tribunal has already held that no compensation is due to the Claimant for the non-continuation after 2013 of the level of state aid under the Special Regime that was in force before 2013. But the position with respect to claw-back of subsidies paid under the Special Regime is not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, to be treated in the same way. Recipients of such subsidies could not have had a legitimate expectation that they would be continued unchanged. But the subsidies having been paid (and subject to any lawful recovery measures by the EC, which did not occur), they remained entitled to the benefit of the stable regime which Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT promised.\n\n431.\n\nIndeed, the effect of the non-application in practice of the law as to unnotified state aid is that continuing investors such as the Claimant are disadvantaged as compared to those who benefited from the Special Regime subsidies but sold their investment prior to the introduction of the Disputed Measures. In the absence of recovery of the unnotified aid from all recipients (which has not happened), the latter group retain the benefit of the earlier subsidies, as reflected in the sale price, without claw-back.\n\n432.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in its decision of 10 November 2017 (C(2017) No. 7384), the EC did not consider the Spanish Disputed Measures, including their claw-back effects, as a violation of the principle of legal certainty and legitimate expectation. Basing itself on the \u2018principle of interpretation in conformity\u2019, the EC found that the \u2018principle of fair and equitable treatment cannot have a broader scope than the Union law notions of legal certainty and legitimate expectations in the context of a State aid scheme\u2019. However, the focus of the EC decision was on the post-2013 situation, as evidenced by its decision \u2018not to raise objections to the aid [*i.e.* the Disputed Measures, leaving aside the previous regime] on the grounds that it [was] compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107(3)(c) [of the] TFEU\u2019. However, as this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to interpret EU law itself but has to accept the consistent interpretation of EU law as applied by the relevant institutions, so does the EC not have jurisdiction to impose a binding interpretation of the meaning of legitimate expectations *under the ECT* (a treaty to which the EU has acceded as a party thereby agreeing to submit itself to the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal, should any dispute arise, and to comply with the resulting binding awards).\n\n433.\n\nThe question thus becomes one of the implications of these conclusions for quantum. To this the Tribunal turns.\n\n**VIII. DAMAGES**\n-----------------\n\n**(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant\u2019s position***\n--------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nThe Claimant argues that it is entitled to full reparation for the harm suffered because of the Disputed Measures. It claims reparation for a reduction in the fair market value of its shares in the SPCs, compound interest and a tax gross-up.570 To assess the damage the Tribunal must take into account the date the last of the Disputed Measures entered into force.571 In doing so, it must use a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.572 This method has often been applied in ECT disputes by international tribunals, especially to investments with a proven track record.573\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 297, 298.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 301.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 303.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 304, 305.\n\n435.\n\nUnder the full reparation standard, according to the Claimant, its damages consist of four different parts. First, the damage consists of *historical damages*, running from the date the first Disputed Measure entered into force until the date the last Disputed Measure entered into force, *i.e*. 30 June 2014.574 Second, the Claimant claims *lost value damages*, which consist of the difference between the value of its shares in a hypothetical but-for scenario in which the Respondent would not have violated the ECT and the value of its shares on 30 June 2014. Third, the Claimant includes *compound interest* on the first two amounts running from 30 June 2014. Fourth, the Claimant adds *a tax-gross up*, which takes into account the hypothetical payment of taxes on the awarded damages.575\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 311.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 310.\n\n436.\n\nTo calculate historical damages Brattle uses a model setting out what the SPCs\u2019 financial performance would have been between December 2012 and 30 June 2014 if Spain had not adopted the Disputed Measures, but RD 661/2007 would have continued to apply.576\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 315, 316; **CE-2**, Brattle First Quantum Report, 18 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 30-38.\n\n437.\n\nSecond, the Claimant and its experts apply a DCF analysis to quantify the impact of the Disputed Measures on the investment (lost value damages). To do so, Brattle compares two scenarios. In the Actual Scenario, it projects the Claimant\u2019s future cash flows to which the Disputed Measures apply. In the second scenario, called the But-For Scenario, Brattle assumes that Eurus has the right to receive payments under RD 661/2007.577 Hence, the But-For Scenario applies the hypothesis that none of the Disputed Measures ever entered into force.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 317.\n\n438.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant argues that the DCF method is the relevant method for the quantification of its damages. Two facts render the method particularly appropriate for the quantification of damages in ECT arbitrations. First, the investment has a long history of profitability and second, several variables that affect the future profitability of the investment can be applied in a reliable way.578\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 318, 319; **CE-2**, Brattle First Quantum Report, 18 November 2016, \u00b6 41.\n\n439.\n\nTo calculate the lost value damages Brattle first determines the future cash flow of each SPC as of the Valuation Date. The experts also take into account business forecasts and the amount due to Eurus under RD 661/2007 as well as under the Disputed Measures. Finally, various maintenance agreements assist the experts in gaining data on operating and maintenance costs of the investor.579\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 323-327; **CE-2**, Brattle First Quantum Report, 18 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 51-57, Appendix F.\n\n440.\n\nSecond, Brattle takes the regulatory risk and the systematic risk into account, which reduced its projection of the future cash flow. The formula that needs to be applied follows the standard capital asset pricing model: Discount rate = Risk Free Rate + (Risk Adjustment Factor x Market Risk Premium). The outcome of the analysis is a discount rate of 4.84%.580\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 328-333; **CE-2**, Brattle First Quantum Report, 18 November 2016, Sec. V.D.2 and \u00b6\u00b6 102-105.\n\n441.\n\nThird, Brattle adjusts its analysis by deducting the value of each SPC\u2019s outstanding debt and the liquidity levels of Eurus\u2019 interest in each SPC.581\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 322, 334, 335.\n\n442.\n\nIn the Rebuttal Quantum Report, Brattle updated the total amount of damages taking into account new data.582 Based on said report Eurus claims losses, exclusive of interest and tax gross-up, of EUR 173 million.583\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 355.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 337.\n\n443.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant argues that, if the Tribunal held that Claimant was entitled to no more than a \u2018reasonable return\u2019 it would nonetheless be entitled to damages.584 This would mean that Eurus would have been entitled to receive a 7% after-tax return \u2013 as under RD 661/2007 \u2013 over a 20-year \u2018regulatory period\u2019.585 In this regard, Brattle proposed two alternative figures of damages, either EUR 237 million or EUR 120 million.586\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 422-426.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 423.\n\n**CE-5**, Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, 29 September 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 220, 221; Cl. Reply, \u00b6 421.\n\n444.\n\nFinally, the Claimant maintains that in order to comply with the standard of full reparation, the award must include compound interest running from the date of the breach, *i.e.* when Spain enacted the Disputed Measures.587 Moreover, the Claimant points out that Spain did not contest the inclusion of compound interest.588 The basis of claim is Article 13(1) of the ECT, which allows for an interest to be applied at a \u2018commercial rate established on a market basis\u2019. Based on Spain\u2019s sovereign borrowing rate, based on a 10-year bond, Brattle deems it appropriate to apply a rate of 1.16% compounded monthly. This is because according to Brattle, the Claimant has become an \u2018unwilling lender\u2019 since Spain did not pay the compensation promptly. This renders the sovereign borrowing rate an appropriate reference. The claim for pre-award interest is EUR 12 million.589\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 306-309.\n\nCl.

In Japan, Eurus would have to pay taxes on the compensation awarded. However, this would leave the Claimant still out of pocket as compared with the situation where the Respondent had not enacted the Disputed Measures. According to Section 2-1-43 of the Japanese Corporate Tax Act, the applicable rate would amount to 27.8%, which needs to be taken into account by the Tribunal.590\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 366; Cl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 343, 344.\n\n446.\n\nIn total, the Claimant\u2019s compensation amounts to EUR 258 million including damages, interest and the tax gross-up.591\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 430.\n\n***b. The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant has not suffered from any damage. Accordingly, the result of the quantum analysis is that Claimant cannot claim any compensation whatsoever. Further, Spain maintains its argument that Claimant\u2019s quantification is wholly speculative.592 Moreover, the DCF analysis is not an adequate method to quantify the Claimant\u2019s damage, even assuming it had suffered damage.593\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 816-832.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 838.\n\n448.\n\nFirst, the Respondent criticises the calculation method chosen by Brattle. Spain puts forward that none of the alleged damages has been proven, which renders the damages speculative and hypothetical. Moreover, the Spanish Supreme Court has rendered more than one hundred judgments rejecting the speculative quantification methods used by the Claimant. According to the Supreme Court that method \u2018lacks [the] necessary rigour and certainty\u2019.594\n\nResp. C.-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1130, 1134-1150.\n\n449.\n\nFurthermore, Spain argues that the DCF method is inappropriate and the Tribunal should adopt an asset-based method. This is because, according to doctrine, the following circumstances render the DCF method inadmissible and impossible:\n\n(a) The fact that it involves a capital-intensive business, with a significant asset base. Practically all its costs arise from investing in tangible infrastructure. There are no relevant intangible assets to analyse.\n\n(b) The high dependency of the cash flows on external, volatile and unpredictable elements, such as the price of the pool, *inter alia*.\n\n(c) The long-term nature of the forecasts.\n\n(d) The disproportion between the alleged investments (and the alleged assumed risk).595\n\nResp. C.-Mem., \u00b6 1143.\n\n450.\n\nTaken together, these circumstances lead to the conclusion that the DCF method is inapplicable. As a result, the Tribunal must apply an asset-based quantification method taking into account the profitability and book value of the investment.596\n\nResp. C.-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1137-1150; Cl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 415-421.\n\n451.\n\nMoreover, Spain argues that Claimant\u2019s returns have been higher than \u2018the reference rates\u2019 used by Eurus and Brattle. Pursuant to BDO\u2019s calculation, the Claimant\u2019s average IRR amounts to 13.43% before taxes, with a result of 15.15% before taxes for the shareholders. Compared to the return before taxes under the Disputed Measures, which is at 7.398%, there is no negative impact. As a result, Eurus is not entitled to any damages.597\n\nResp. C.-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1151-1153; BDO Expert Report, \u00b6 172 and Table 20; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 833-838; Second BDO Expert Report, Table 15.\n\n452.\n\nNonetheless, BDO performs a subsidiary DCF analysis to show that there has not been any negative impact on the Claimant\u2019s investment. To compare the Actual Scenario with a But-For Scenario, BDO applies similar criteria as Brattle. However, it uses lower revenues and a shorter useful life of the plants, reduced to 20 years. As to the But-For Scenario, BDO changes the parameters of the analysis, reaching a different result compared to Brattle\u2019s analysis. According to BDO\u2019s DCF analysis, the impact of the disputed measures on Claimant\u2019s investment is \u2018neutral or mildly positive for the Claimant\u2019.598\n\nResp. C.-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 1154ff; BDO Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 276ff; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 839-842.\n\n453.\n\nAs to the determination of interest, the Respondent does not object to the application of pre-award interest. However, Brattle calculates interest on the basis of a ten-year Spanish bond, whereas BDO uses a short-term government debt interest rate. Using the ten-year bond artificially inflates the risk and therefore the compensation, which is contrary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the principle laid out by the Court in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case.599\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 843-849.\n\n454.\n\nFinally, Spain maintains that the tax gross-up claim is inadmissible and unjustified. This is for three reasons. First, Article 21 of the ECT contains a tax carve-out, preventing the Claimant from asking for a compensation for any hypothetical taxes it will have to pay. Furthermore, the tax cannot be attributed to the Respondent under the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, as the tax is applied by a third state. As it is not an act of the Respondent, it is not attributable to Spain. Second, the Claimant has not submitted any proof as to their obligation to pay taxes on the award in Japan. In this regard, Spain also argues that Eurus Japan\u2019s alleged damages would flow-through its wholly-owned Dutch subsidiary, Eurus Europe, which may have liabilities, like taxes, loans, etc. But Eurus Japan\u2019s tax gross-up claim fails to account for the corporate layer of Eurus Europe.600 Third, all this renders the claim \u2018speculative, contingent and uncertain\u2019.601 As BDO points out, this conclusion is supported by the fact that Brattle only dedicated three paragraphs to the tax gross-up.602\n\nHearing Day 5, p. 233, 15-25; pp. 234-235 (Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Antu\u00f1a).\n\nResp.

Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 850-895.\n\nBDO Expert Report, \u00b6 311.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n455.\n\nIt follows from the Tribunal\u2019s decisions on jurisdiction and liability that neither of the primary claims of the Parties as to quantum can be accepted.\n\n456.\n\nIn terms of jurisdiction, the Claimant\u2019s primary claim includes an amount on account of TVPEE, which claim the Tribunal has held to be outside its jurisdiction.\n\n457.\n\nIn terms of substance, the Claimant\u2019s experts value the claim on the basis that the Claimant had a \u2018legal entitlement to a specific schedule of tariffs\u2019 reflected in RD 661/2007.603 As put by the Claimant in closing:\n\nThat regime, Royal Decree 661, is our but-for, and it is our but-for scenario however you might choose to parse out the various plants that comprise the Claimant\u2019s investment.604\n\nSee e.g. **CE-5**, Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, 29 September 2017, \u00b6 10.\n\nHearing Day 5, p. 14, ll 2-5 (Mr. Lingard).\n\n458.\n\nThe Tribunal has however held, by majority, that the Claimant\u2019s investments had no right to subsidies at the level of RD 661/2007, and no legitimate expectation to such subsidies either. Moreover, even if there had been such an expectation, the but-for situation would not have been, as the Claimant argues, RD 661/2007, with or without modifications, but something more indeterminate.\n\n459.\n\nIt is not, however, necessary to pursue these issues further. The Tribunal has held that the breach of Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT is limited to the effects of the \u2018retroactive reduction in the allowed return\u2019 (the \u2018**Claw-Back Feature of the Disputed Measures**\u2019),605 and the question is how to value that amount.\n\nTo use the terminology of the CE-5, Brattle Rebuttal Quantum Report, 29 September 2017, \u00b6 10.\n\n460.\n\nLike the *RREEF* tribunal, the present Tribunal has not been able, despite its best efforts, to quantify the amount of this retroactive reduction on the basis of the reports and supporting work papers filed by the Parties\u2019 respective experts.606 It is, however, satisfied that the Parties\u2019 experts are qualified and have sufficient knowledge of the case and that the different results obtained by both experts are a result of the different calculation methods which they applied. Consequently, the Tribunal decides that the Parties, with the assistance of their experts, shall seek to reach an agreement on the impact of the Claw-Back Feature of the Disputed Measures alone, on the basis that those measures were otherwise consistent with the ECT.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Alternative Claim incorporates this amount but does not assist in identifying it: ibid, \u00b6\u00b6 220, 221.\n\n461.\n\nIf the Parties cannot, within 3 months of the date of this Decision, reach agreement on the amount payable in this respect, either Party may request the Tribunal to decide the outstanding issues in dispute, in accordance with a prompt briefing schedule. If the Parties do reach agreement on the amount due, they should report this to the Tribunal in order to enable it to issue an Award incorporating this Decision and dealing with any residual issues identified, including costs, thereby terminating the proceedings.\n\n**(3) The Tax Gross-up Claim**\n------------------------------\n\n462.\n\nOne matter of quantum that can be resolved at this stage is the tax gross-up claim.\n\n463.\n\nThe Claimant seeks compensation for the hypothetical payment of taxes in Japan so that it can receive full reparation.607 The Respondent rejects the claim on the ground that it cannot be held liable to pay for tax measures implemented by a third state.\n\nCl. Reply, \u00b6 1241.\n\n464.\n\nIn this context, it is significant that there appears to be no precedent for the award of a tax gross-up involving taxation of a third state. In five recent cases, *Eiser*,608*Masdar*,609*Antin*,610*OperaFund*,611 and *BayWa*,612 the tribunals rejected the gross-up claims for lack of supporting evidence.\n\n**CL-0079**, *Eiser*, \u00b6 456.\n\n**CL-0113**, *Masdar*, \u00b6 660.\n\n**CL-0114**, *Antin*, \u00b6 673.\n\n**RL-0093**, *OperaFund*, \u00b6 704.\n\n**RL-0095**, *BayWa*, \u00b6 626.\n\n465.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that, on the material now available, there is uncertainty as to the legal position on damages and taxation.613 It is unclear at what point the damages awarded would have been taxed in the normal course and remitted in whole or in part to the Claimant. Eurus also failed to submit a persuasive rebuttal of Spain\u2019s argument that Eurus Japan\u2019s tax gross-up claim fails to account for the corporate layer of Eurus Europe.\n\nHearing Day 1, p. 231, ll 2-16 (Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Antu\u00f1a).\n\n466.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunal rejects the claim for a tax gross-up.\n\n**IX. CONCLUSIONS**\n-------------------\n\n467.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds, by majority:\n\n(a) that the ECT and the European state aid regime apply concurrently to the investment and form part of the applicable law;\n\n(b) that the Claimant did not have a legitimate expectation that the Special Regime subsidies, notably in terms of RD 661/2007, would continue to be paid for the lifetime of its plants;\n\n(c) that the retro-active claw back by Spain, in and after 2013, of subsidies earlier paid at levels in excess of the amounts that would have been payable under the Disputed Measures, had they been in force in previous years, did breach the obligation of stability under Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT;\n\n(d) that there was no other breach of the ECT;\n\n(e) that all other claims must be rejected.\n\n468.\n\nThe Parties shall seek to reach agreement on the impact of the claw-back feature of the Disputed Measures, on the basis that those measures were otherwise consistent with the ECT, taking in due account the reasoning and findings in the present Decision.\n\n469.\n\nIf the Parties do not, within 3 months of the date of this Decision, reach agreement on the amount payable in this respect, either of them may request the Tribunal to decide the outstanding issues in dispute, in accordance with a prompt briefing schedule. If the Parties do reach agreement on the amount due, they should report this to the Tribunal in order to enable it to issue an Award incorporating this Decision and dealing with any residual issues identified, including costs, thereby terminating the proceedings."}]}
