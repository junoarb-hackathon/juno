Yves Fortier, Q.C., Arbitrator\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. DISCLOSURE BY L. YVES FORTIER, Q.C.**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 4 October, 2011, Mr. Fortier wrote by email to the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes \"making [a] disclosure, pursuant to Article 6 of the ICSID Convention, in relation to the announced merger of the firm of which he is a partner, Norton Rose OR LLP, with Macleod Dixon LLP, to become effective on 1 January 2012\".\n\n2.\n\nIn his disclosure, Mr. Fortier stated that it had been brought to his attention, through the conflict checks conducted as part of the due diligence performed in relation to the merger, that the Caracas office of Macleod Dixon LLP, Despacho de Abogados miembros de Macleod Dixon, S.C.: (a) has provided, and continues to provide, legal services to one of the Parties, namely, ConocoPhillips Company; (b) is acting adverse to the interests of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in certain matters, including one where the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is the respondent in an ICSID case filed by Universal Compression International Holdings S.L.U. against Venezuela; and (c) is acting on behalf of ConocoPhillips Company in ICC cases involving the Venezuelan state owned petroleum company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.\n\n3.\n\nMr. Fortier stated that he was making the disclosure at the first possible opportunity, the partners of the two partnerships involved in this merger having been presented with, and called upon to vote on, the potential merger between 1 October and 3 October, 2011, and the merger having been announced on the morning of that same day (4 October, 2011).\n\n4.\n\nMr. Fortier stated his conviction that the facts being disclosed had no bearing whatsoever on his ability to exercise independent judgment in this case. He said that he had no knowledge of the matters set forth in paragraph 2 above, and had had no communication regarding the matter, other than as strictly required for the purposes of his disclosure. However, he had been informed by the General Counsel of Norton Rose OR LLP that, out of an abundance of caution, formal measures were immediately, well before the effective date of the merger, being put into place within Norton Rose OR LLP and Macleod Dixon LLP in order to avoid any communication of information between members of Norton Rose OR LLP who were involved or might become involved in the future in this arbitration and members of Macleod Dixon LLP who were involved or might be involved in the future in any of those matters, or any other matter involving, or which in the future may involve, ConocoPhillips Company or the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\n5.\n\nAt Mr. Fortier\u2019s request, the disclosure was transmitted to his co-arbitrators and the Parties on the same day.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S PROPOSAL TO DISQUALIFY L. YVES FORTIER, Q.C.**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 5 October, 2011, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, in light of the forthcoming merger and the alleged \"extent and depth of Macleod Dixon, S.C.\u2019s involvement in multiple matters adverse to the Republic, PDVSA and its affiliates, including matters for ConocoPhillips\" (\"Proposal for Disqualification\").\n\n7.\n\nOn 6 October, 2011, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken with respect to the Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n8.\n\nOn 12 October, 2011, the President of the Tribunal, having consulted with Professor Abi-Saab, set a timetable for the Parties to submit observations and Mr. Fortier to furnish explanations as provided for under Arbitration Rule 9, as follows:\n\n\u2022 The Claimants were invited to submit a reply to the Proposal for Disqualification by 25 October, 2011;\n\n\u2022 Mr. Fortier was invited to furnish any explanations that he wished to provide by 8 November, 2011; and\n\n\u2022 Within two weeks of the date of any submission by Mr. Fortier, each Party was permitted to submit any further observations that it might wish to make.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of 13 October, 2011, the Respondent raised six factual inquiries of Mr. Fortier and the Claimants and their counsel and provided a list of what it considered to be the relevant precedents (\"the Respondent\u2019s 13 October Submission\"). The inquiries were as follows:\n\n[W]e believe it is important to have a full explanation of (i) the extent of Macleod Dixon\u2019s advice and relationship with ConocoPhillips companies, whether in Venezuela or outside of Venezuela, (ii) the working relationship between Macleod Dixon and Freshfields generally and specifically in the arbitrations brought by ConocoPhillips subsidiaries against Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. under both the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements, including whether any discussions have taken place concerning this ICSID Arbitration or concerning the relationship between those cases and this Arbitration, (iii) Macleod Dixon\u2019s representation of companies in connection with the 2007 migration process, including the identity of those companies and the nature of the assignments, (iv) the approximate percentage of annual revenues of Macleod Dixon\u2019s Caracas office over the last five years derived from matters in which they were adverse to Respondent or to Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. or its subsidiaries, (v) a list of all litigation or arbitration matters of Macleod Dixon against the Respondent or Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. or its subsidiaries, and all assignments preparatory to possible litigation or arbitration, and (vi) the contacts between Mr. Fortier and members of his arbitration team and Macleod Dixon, including any files on which they are or were working together, plans for the coordination of the international arbitration group and the business plan for promoting the combined firm\u2019s expertise in this area.1\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Letter of 13 Oct, 2011 (\"Resp. 13 Oct. Subm.\") at pp. 1-2.\n\n10.\n\nOn 14 October, 2011, the Secretary of the Tribunal, on behalf of Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab, requested that any observations about the factual inquiries in the Respondent\u2019s 13 October Submission, be submitted within the framework of the existing briefing schedule.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 18 October, 2011, Mr. Fortier informed Judge Keith, Professor Abi-Saab and the Parties that, on 17 October, 2011, he had informed the members of the Executive Committee of Norton Rose OR LLP that he had decided to resign from the Firm, effective 31 December, 2011 (\"Fortier Letter of 18 October\"). In his letter, he stated that his relationship with the firm would cease entirely as of that date and provided further details about this. He confirmed that, during the intervening period, the ethical screen in fact put in place on 5 October, 2011, would be maintained.\n\n12.\n\nOn 19 October, 2011, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal stating that, \"[i]n light of the disclosures provided by [Mr.] Fortier in his letter dated October 18, 2011, it is clear that there is no basis for a challenge to the independence and impartiality of [Mr.] Fortier in this arbitration\". The Claimants invited the Respondent to confirm the same.\n\n13.\n\nOn 19 October, 2011, the Respondent stated that it was considering the issue and requested that it receive answers from all concerned to the questions raised in the Respondent\u2019s Submission of 13 October.\n\n14.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated 21 October, 2011, Mr. Fortier provided to Judge Keith, Professor Abi-Saab and the Parties, a Norton Rose OR LLP Press release stating that he would be leaving the firm on 31 December, 2011, to pursue his career independently.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of 24 October, 2011, the Respondent stated its belief that the issue underlying the Proposal for Disqualification had not been resolved by Mr. Fortier\u2019s resignation from Norton Rose OR LLP, and stated that it continued to propose his disqualification and requested his withdrawal from the case (\"the Respondent\u2019s 24 October Submission\"). The Respondent made a further factual inquiry about whether there would be \"any office sharing arrangements, arrangements for the provision of secretarial or other support services, or consulting or billing arrangements between Mr. Fortier and the combined firm\".2\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Letter of 24 Oct., 2011 (\"Resp. 24 Oct. Subm.\") at p. 5.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Disqualification Proposal on 25 October, 2011 (\"the Claimants\u2019 Reply\").\n\n17.\n\nOn 26 October, 2011, the Respondent indicated by email that it would respond to the Claimants\u2019 Reply early the following week. Later on 26 October, 2011, the Claimants requested that the Parties be given specific directions as to the schedule for the remaining submissions on this matter.\n\n18.\n\nOn 27 October, 2011, the Parties were requested to make any further submissions regarding the Proposal for Disqualification within the framework of the briefing schedule established in the letter sent on behalf of Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab on 12 October, 2011.\n\n19.\n\nOn 28 October, 2011, Mr. Fortier requested an extension of the date for submission of his explanations to Friday, 18 November, 2011. On 31 October, 2011, Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab granted the extension requested.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of 17 November, 2011, Mr. Fortier submitted his further explanations in connection with the Proposal for Disqualification (\"Mr. Fortier\u2019s Further Explanations\").\n\n21.\n\nOn 1 December, 2011, Respondent submitted its final observations in response to the Claimants\u2019 Reply and Mr. Fortier\u2019s Further Explanations (\"Respondent\u2019s Final Observations\").\n\n22.\n\nOn 2 December, 2011, the Claimants submitted their Additional Observations Concerning the Respondent\u2019s Disqualification Proposal (\"Claimants\u2019 Additional Observations\").\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS AND MR. FORTIER'S EXPLANATIONS**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that facts exist, including the alleged failure to make disclosure of certain facts, that \"constitute a \"circumstance that might cause [an arbitrator's] reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party'\",3 and warrant the disqualification of Mr. Fortier.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Final Observations dated 1 Dec., 2011 (\"Resp. Final Obs.\") at p. 14 (citing ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2)).\n\n24.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, these facts include the \"targeting by Norton Rose of Macleod Dixon as a merger partner and the importance of Macleod Dixon\u2019s Caracas office in that regard\", and \"the fact that Macleod Dixon saw the arbitration expertise of the Norton Rose arbitration group in Montreal, the most prominent member of which is Mr. Fortier, as a significant advantage of the merger from its viewpoint\".4\n\nResp. Final Obs. at p. 14. *See also* Respondent\u2019s letter proposing the disqualification of Mr. Fortier dated 5 Oct., 2011 (\"Proposal for Disqualification\") at p. 2; Resp. 24 Oct. Subm. at pp. 1-2.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent claims that this is of concern because \"Macleod Dixon is and has been for many years more adverse to Respondent than any other law firm in the world\". That point, it says, has not been contested.5 The Respondent asserts that \"[a] large portion of the business of Macleod Dixon\u2019s Caracas office is representing clients, including international oil companies, in both litigation and pre-litigation dispute matters against the Government, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (\"PDVSA') or its affiliates\".6 In this regard, the Respondent notes that Macleod Dixon is representing ConocoPhillips companies in matters against PDVSA, and asserts that members of the Claimants\u2019 counsel team are also handling certain of these matters.7\n\nResp. 24 Oct. Subm. at pp. 1-2. *See also* Proposal for Disqualification at pp. 2-3; Resp. Final Obs. at pp. 1-2.\n\nResp. 24 Oct. Subm. at pp. 1-2. *See also* Resp. Final Obs. at pp. 1-2.\n\nResp. Final Obs. at pp. 2-3.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the statement of a Macleod Dixon partner that Norton Rose OR and Macleod Dixon have started to work together on some files,8 and states that \"[n]o one has informed us as to the nature of the \"files\u2019 on which lawyers from Norton Rose and Macleod Dixon have already been working together, including whether any of those files involve matters adverse to Respondent or PDVSA or its affiliates, which lawyers are involved, and how long they have been so working\".9 The Respondent states a concern that the ethical screen established on 5 October, 2011, was not set up earlier \"when there had to be considerable contacts between the two firms about their respective practices\".10 The Respondent further asserts that an ethical wall does not \"resolve the fundamental issue of bias, whether conscious or unconscious, which a reasonable person would fear may exist from the moment that Norton Rose targeted Macleod Dixon as a merger partner and entered into serious negotiations with a view to accomplishing that strategic objective\".11\n\nResp. 24 Oct. Subm. at p. 2.\n\n*Id*.\n\nResp. 24 Oct. Subm. at p. 4.\n\n*Id*. at p. 5. *See also* Resp. Final Obs. at p. 12.\n\n27.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, an obligation of disclosure existed \"long before the formal vote on the merger\".12 In the Respondent\u2019s view \"disclosure of the merger negotiations should have been made long before October 4, when Mr. Fortier knew or upon reasonable inquiry would have known, and when his firm obviously knew, of Macleod Dixon\u2019s practice, not after Respondent learned of the merger through the internet\".13 If such a disclosure had been made promptly, as required by the ICSID Rules, the Respondent would have moved immediately to disqualify Mr. Fortier. The Respondent claims that this alleged \"[f]ailure to disclose at a much earlier stage, when serious merger discussions were commenced, constituted a failure to disclose a \"circumstance that might cause [the arbitrator's] reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party'\".14\n\nResp. Final Obs. at p. 10 (citing *In re Eastern Sugar Antitrust Litigation*, F.2d 524 (3d Cir. 1982)).\n\nResp. Final Obs. at pp. 1, 6-9.\n\n*Id*. at p. 6 (citing ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2)).\n\n28.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, Mr. Fortier\u2019s resignation from his firm does not resolve the issue at hand.15 The Respondent asserts that the matters adverse to Venezuela and PDVSA would have been uncovered at a relatively early stage of the merger negotiations, and that disclosure should have been made at that time.16 Specifically, the Respondent claims that because \"Macleod Dixon\u2019s Venezuela office... was a material factor motivating the law firm merger for Norton Rose, and Norton Rose\u2019s international arbitration expertise based in Montreal was a key motivation for Macleod Dixon,\"17 \"[f]rom these facts and common sense, we concluded that Mr. Fortier must have known of Macleod Dixon\u2019s involvement with ConocoPhillips and/or its adverse relationship to Respondent, PDVSA or its affiliates long before October 4, 2011... \".18\n\n*Id*. at p. 3.\n\nResp. 24 Oct. Subm. at pp. 3-4. *See also* Resp. Final Obs. at p. 3.\n\nResp. 24 Oct. Subm. at p. 2. *See also* Resp. Final Obs. at p. 3.\n\nResp. Final Obs. at p. 3.\n\n29.\n\nIn response to Mr. Fortier\u2019s statements that he, in fact, had no knowledge of the breadth and significance of the matters adverse to the Respondent and PDVSA and its affiliates being handled by Macleod Dixon, that he had no involvement in the merger discussions, and that he was only apprised of the professional relationship between Macleod Dixon and ConocoPhillips Company late in the week of 26 September, 2011, the Respondent asserts that \"Mr. Fortier\u2019s lack of involvement in the merger discussions is not relevant to the disqualification proposal\".19 The Respondent asserts that \"[t]he problem is not created by his involvement in those negotiations, but by the failure to disclose promptly - as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) - his firm\u2019s actions\".20 Arbitrators, the Respondent says, are required to conduct conflict checks when a significant event occurs which could change the conclusion reached at the outset of the arbitration that there was no conflict, such as a law firm merger. An arbitrator is under a duty to make reasonable enquiries to investigate any potential conflict of interest.21 \"Mr. Fortier does not say that he was not aware of the merger discussions, and does not say what inquiry, if any, he made as to potential conflicts once he knew that such discussions... were taking place\".22 The Respondent considers that in the circumstances \"disclosure of the merger negotiations should have been made long before October 4, when Mr. Fortier knew or upon reasonable inquiry would have known, and when his firm obviously knew\".23 That failure cannot be cured by the arbitrator\u2019s resignation from the firm as opposed to resignation from the Tribunal.\n\n*Id*. at p. 4.\n\nResp. Final Obs. at p. 10.\n\n*Id*. at p. 4.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*. at p. 6.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that Mr. Fortier\u2019s resignation is not effective until 31 December, 2011, and argues that \"[i]f there was a problem before the announcement of Mr. Fortier\u2019s resignation from his firm, as there surely was, that problem has not gone away, and we do not believe that it evaporates on New Year\u2019s eve, by which time key decisions in the case may have been made... over the course of the last fifteen months since the oral argument in The Hague\".24\n\nResp. 24 Oct. Subm. at p. 4.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"[n]o matter how hard one tries to maintain impartiality when one\u2019s firm has decided on a strategic objective of a merger with another firm so pervasively adverse to a party in a case in which one is sitting as an arbitrator, the serious risk of conscious or unconscious bias exists, which in this case would call into question any decision on any issue on which the Tribunal favors Claimants\u2019 position over that of Respondent\".25 The Respondent asserts that \"[t]he objection in this case is not predicated on any actual lack of independence or impartiality, but on apprehensions of the appearance of impropriety\".26 \"[I]t is clear that the rules regarding conflicts and disclosure obligations are not dependent upon proof of actual impact on the position taken by an arbitrator... The standard is an objective one and many cases speak of the possibility of \"conscious or unconscious\u2019 bias\".27\n\nResp. Final Obs. at p. 12.\n\n*Id*. at p. 13.\n\nResp. Final Obs. at p. 12 (citing various decisions of the Canadian courts).\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts that \"no litigant should be in the position of having as a member of a tribunal an arbitrator who has been forced to take an \"emotional decision' as Mr. Fortier has taken in resigning from his firm after the party was compelled to submit a proposal for disqualification\".28 The Respondent argues that \"the perception of conscious or unconscious bias is exacerbated in such a situation\".29\n\nResp. 24 Oct. Subm. at p. 6.\n\n*Id*.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent concludes its final observations in these terms:\n\nIn this case, there is no question that Respondent\u2019s disqualification proposal is based on \"actual, objective facts\u2019 which are essentially undisputed. Those facts include: (i) the targeting by Norton Rose of Macleod Dixon as a merger partner and the importance of Macleod Dixon\u2019s Caracas office in that regard; (ii) the fact that Macleod Dixon saw the arbitration expertise of the Norton Rose arbitration group in Montreal, the most prominent member of which is Mr. Fortier, as a significant advantage of the merger from its standpoint; (iii) the breadth and significance of Macleod Dixon\u2019s Caracas practice adverse to Respondent and PDVSA and its affiliates, including a major case together with Claimants\u2019 counsel in this case against PDVSA on behalf of ConocoPhillips\u2019s companies arising out of the same association agreements at issue in this case; (iv) the nondisclosure of such circumstances during the course of serious merger negotiations, which obviously took place over a period of months and while the Tribunal has been deliberating; (v) the initial announcement by Mr. Fortier that he thought the merger posed no problem to his remaining a member of the Tribunal; and (vi) the fact that we still have not received answers to the specific questions raised in our prior letters. Collectively, these undisputed facts constitute a \"circumstance that might cause [an arbitrator's] reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party.' The failure to make disclosure warrants disqualification in this extremely important case.30\n\nResp. Final Obs. at at pp. 13-14 (citing ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2)).\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANTS' SUBMISSIONS**\n---------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants contend that there is no ground to disqualify Mr. Fortier under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and request that the Proposal for Disqualification be dismissed.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimants assert that \"[t]he notion of arbitral independence as applied by ICSID tribunals is an objective test for the existence of circumstances that result in a manifest lack of independence on the part of the arbitrator\".31 Accordingly, for disqualification to occur, facts must be adduced that demonstrate such a manifest lack of the required qualities.\n\nCl.

Reply at \u00b6 12.\n\n37.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants assert that the facts demonstrate that: \"(*a*) there is not now and never will be a conflict of interest; (*b*) [Mr.] Fortier has no information in his possession concerning any work done by Macleod Dixon LLP... in relation to the Claimants, the Respondent or any corporations owned by the Respondent; and (*c*) [Mr.] Fortier has had no involvement in the merger between Macleod Dixon and Norton Rose OR LLP... or related negotiations\".33 In their view \"because the disclosures from [Mr.] Fortier conclusively establish that he has never received any information concerning Macleod Dixon\u2019s work for ConocoPhillips or against Venezuela, and also that [Mr.] Fortier will never be associated with Macleod Dixon, the information sought in the Respondent\u2019s letter dated October 13, 2011 is irrelevant\".34\n\nCl.

YVES FORTIER Q.C.'S EXPLANATIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn his disclosure, Mr. Fortier stated that it had been brought to his attention, as a result of the due diligence performed in relation to the proposed merger of Norton Rose OR and Macleod Dixon, that Macleod Dixon: (a) provides legal services to one of the Parties, namely, ConocoPhillips Company; (b) is acting adverse to the interests of the Respondent in certain matters, including in another ICSID case against Venezuela; and (c) is acting on behalf of ConocoPhillips Company in ICC cases involving the Venezuelan state owned petroleum company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. He stated that he had no knowledge of these matters, and had had no communication about them, other than as strictly required for the purposes of his disclosure. Mr. Fortier said he was convinced that the facts being disclosed did not affect his ability to exercise independent judgment in this case. He reported that he had been informed that, out of an abundance of caution, an ethical screen was immediately, well in advance of the effective date of the merger, being put into place within Norton Rose OR and Macleod Dixon.\n\n42.\n\nUpon informing Judge Keith, Professor Abi-Saab and the Parties of his decision to resign from Norton Rose OR, effective 31 December, 2011, Mr. Fortier stated that his decision was motivated by his desire to continue his practice as arbitrator and mediator without having to contend with the risks of conflicts inherent to being a partner in a firm associated with a global law practice.45 He also noted that he had been considering this decision carefully since November 2010 when Ogilvy Renault announced that it would join the Norton Rose Group, and since Norton Rose OR LLP\u2019s announcement that it would merge with Macleod Dixon LLP as of 1 January, 2012.\n\nMr. Fortier\u2019s letter dated 18 Oct., 2011 (\"Fortier 18 Oct. Ltr.\") at p. 1.\n\n43.\n\nMr. Fortier confirmed that he had no entitlement to any retirement benefit from Norton Rose OR. He also stated that, as of 1 January, 2012, he would cease to have any access to the firm\u2019s files and information systems. During the intervening period, the ethical screen put in place on 5 October, 2011, would be maintained. Mr. Fortier confirmed that the only person at Norton Rose OR who had assisted him in the present case - a junior associate - had already signed the undertakings establishing the ethical wall, and that she had not done any work in this matter since August 2011. He also confirmed that he would not call upon that junior associate or any other person from Norton Rose OR to assist him in the case in the future.46\n\nFortier 18 Oct. Ltr. at pp 1-2.\n\n44.\n\nIn response to the inquiries raised in the Respondent\u2019s 13 October Submission, Mr. Fortier confirmed that he had not been involved in any way in the negotiation leading to Norton Rose OR LLP\u2019s future merger with Macleod Dixon. He also stated, in response to the Respondent\u2019s sixth inquiry (*see* paragraph 9 above), that he had \"not taken part in or been privy to the plans (if any) \"for the coordination of the international arbitration group and the business plan for promoting the combined firm\u2019s expertise in this area.'\" Mr. Fortier stated that he had no knowledge of the information sought in the Respondent\u2019s other five inquiries in that submission.\n\n45.\n\nIn Mr. Fortier\u2019s Further Explanations, he responded to the points raised by the Respondent in the Respondent\u2019s 24 October Submission. Specifically, he stated that he has \"no knowledge of any file (if indeed any exists) \"on which lawyers from Norton Rose and Macleod Dixon have already been working together.'\"47 Further, \"[he] can categorically state that [he had] had no involvement in any such file, nor [has he] been made privy to any information about any such file\".48\n\nMr. Fortier\u2019s Further Explanations dated 17 Nov., 2011 (\"Fortier Further Expl.) at p. 1.\n\n*Id*.\n\n46.\n\nIn reply to the Respondent\u2019s assertion that he \"must have known almost a year ago \"the breadth and significance of the matters adverse to the Respondent and PDVSA and its affiliates being handled by Macleod Dixon' and that [he] should have made a disclosure at that time,\"49 Mr. Fortier said that he \"had no such knowledge and had no involvement in the merger discussions between Norton Rose and Macleod Dixon,\" and that he was \"only apprised of the professional relationship between Macleod Dixon and ConocoPhillips Company late in the week of September 26\".50\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id.*\n\n47.\n\nWith respect to the timing of the disclosure, Mr. Fortier stated that \"[i]mmediately after the result of the vote was announced on 3 October, [he] notified the Secretary General of ICSID that [he] would be making a disclosure under Arbitration Rule 6 and [he] made his disclosure on 4 October\".51 He said that \"[he] had no reason whatsoever to make any disclosure prior to that time\".52\n\nFortier Further Expl. at p. 1.\n\n*Id*.\n\n48.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent\u2019s queries about whether there would be \"any office sharing arrangements, arrangements for the provision of secretarial or other support services, or consulting or billing arrangements between Mr. Fortier and the combined firm,\"53 Mr. Fortier responded that he intends to have rental premises that will allow him, \"as of 1 January 2012, to continue [his] practice as an arbitrator and mediator autonomous from Norton Rose OR / Norton Rose Canada\".54 Additionally, he has entered into discussions about joining a set of chambers in London and plans to work occasionally from home.\n\nResp. 24 Oct. Subm. at p. 5.\n\nFortier Further Expl. at p. 1.\n\n49.\n\nFinally, in relation to the Respondent\u2019s reference to his statement in the Norton Rose OR LLP Press Release that his decision to leave the firm was an \"emotional decision\" to take,55 Mr. Fortier stated that \"the source of this emotion was his long association with Ogilvy Renault, which was his home for more than 50 years,\" and that this home changed over a year ago when that firm merged with Norton Rose.56 He asserted that \"these very natural emotions (which are balanced by the exhilaration of embarking on my own venture) do not and will not prevent [him] from continuing to exercise impartial and independent judgement in the present arbitration, about which [he has] always been and remain[s] dispassionate\".57\n\nResp. 24 Oct. Subm. at p. 6.\n\nFortier Further Expl. at p 2.\n\n*Id*.\n\n50.\n\nMr. Fortier \"reiterate[d] [his] profound conviction that [he is], always [has] been and will remain, able to exercise independent judgment in the present arbitration\".58 He also confirmed that he sees no reason to reconsider his decision not to withdraw from the case.59\n\nFortier 18 Oct. Ltr. at p. 2.\n\nFortier Further Expl. at p. 2.\n\n**III. DECISION ON THE PROPOSAL FOR DISQUALIFICATION**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS**\n---------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Convention provides in Article 14(1) that members of panels are to be \"persons of high moral character... who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\". Under Article 57, a party may propose to a Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members \"on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\". In the terms of Article 58, the proposal in this particular case is to be decided by \"the other members of the... Tribunal\" unless they are equally divided.\n\n52.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent emphasises the requirements of ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) under which arbitrators have a continuing obligation promptly to notify the Secretary-General of the Centre of any relationship with the parties or circumstances that might cause an arbitrator\u2019s reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party. In this context, the Respondent also refers to General Standard 7(c) of the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration (2004) which reads as follows:\n\nAn arbitrator is under a duty to make reasonable enquiries to investigate any potential conflict of interest, as well as any facts or circumstances that may cause his or her impartiality or independence to be questioned. Failure to disclose a potential conflict is not excused by lack of knowledge if the arbitrator makes no reasonable attempt to investigate.\n\n53.\n\nWhile we were referred to authorities from a number of international and national jurisdictions on judicial and arbitral independence and impartiality, we have gained most assistance from those which have ruled on challenges to members of ICSID tribunals under the provisions of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules which we too are to apply. The authorities from other jurisdictions relate to different legal rules and standards, established by treaty, law or the rulings of judicial and arbitral bodies, and are to be understood in their particular contexts which also differ.\n\n54.\n\nICSID decisions call attention to a slight difference between the English and French texts and the Spanish text of Article 14(1). The former use the expression \"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\" / \"offre toute garantie d\u2019ind\u00e9pendence dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions\" while the latter refers to a person who \"inspirar plena confianza en su imparcialidad de juicio\" (emphasis added). (The three language texts of Arbitration Rule 6 also include slight differences.) Since all three texts are declared to be equally authentic, and because of their close relationship in principle and in practice, we apply the two standards of independence and impartiality in making our decision. As those decisions also say, independence concerns the lack of relations with a party that might influence the arbitrator while impartiality involves not favouring one party or the other.60\n\n*See Universal Compression International Holdings, S.L.U. v.

Further, the manifest lack of the required qualities, here independence and impartiality of judgment, must appear from objective evidence.61\n\n*Universal* at \u00b6 71; *Suez* at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 40.\n\n57.\n\nAs indicated earlier, the Respondent emphasised what it saw as a conflict of interest in Mr. Fortier\u2019s failure to disclose to the Parties, at a much earlier stage, the negotiations between the two law firms. That contention presents a number of questions of law: what is the extent of that obligation of disclosure? In particular what, if any, obligation does it impose on an arbitrator in the course of a proceeding to inquire into possible conflicts? And what is the consequence of the breach of the obligation to disclose, if it is established?\n\n58.\n\nArbitrators are obliged to disclose information which they see as falling within the text stated in Arbitration Rule 6 if that knowledge actually comes to their notice. But to what extent are they to make inquiries about possible conflicts unknown to them, including the situation where, as here, the arbitration is under way? The Respondent emphasised the IBA General Standard 7(c), quoted in paragraph 52 above, and, in particular, its last sentence: failure to disclose is not excused by a lack of knowledge if the arbitrator makes no reasonable attempt to investigate. Whether there is in any given case an obligation to undertake such an investigation depends very much on the facts which we examine later.\n\n59.\n\nThe IBA General Standards are not law for ICSID tribunals. Moreover, in their own terms, they are \"Guidelines\"; \"they are not legal rules and do not override any... arbitral rules chosen by the parties\". The Working Group which prepared them trusted that \"they would be applied with robust common sense and without pedantic and unduly formalistic interpretation\". Further, the conflict of interest text incorporated in General Standard 2(b) is significantly different from that in Article 57 of the Convention and is easier to satisfy. The standard requires resignation or disqualification \"if facts or circumstances have arisen since the appointment that from a reasonable third person\u2019s point of view, having knowledge of the relevant facts, give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator\u2019s impartiality or independence\" (emphasis added).\n\n60.\n\nTo come to the last question raised in paragraph 57, we do not consider that a non disclosure does in itself result in disqualification. The IBA Guidelines, endorsed by an ICSID decision on this point, say that non disclosure cannot make an arbitrator partial or lacking in independence; it is only the facts and circumstances that he did not disclose that can do so.62 That proposition is, however, subject to this qualification - depending on the particular facts and circumstances, the non disclosure may itself give rise to a reasonable suspicion of bias, whether conscious or unconscious.\n\n*Tidewater* at \u00b6 43.\n\n**B. THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES**\n----------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nAs we begin our consideration of the facts and circumstances, one feature of the Respondent\u2019s submissions is to be recalled. The Respondent stated that, had the merger proposal been disclosed promptly, as required by the ICSID rules, it would have immediately moved at that time to disqualify Mr. Fortier, given the significance and breadth of Macleod Dixon\u2019s adverse relationships to the Respondent, PDVSA and its affiliates, including Macleod Dixon\u2019s ongoing representation of ConocoPhillips itself.63 That position requires us to consider the situation as it was on 4 October, 2011, when Mr. Fortier wrote to the Secretary-General of ICSID and at an earlier time, unspecified, when the Respondent says Mr. Fortier should have made the disclosure.\n\nResp. Final Obs. at p. 1.\n\n62.\n\nAs the Respondent says, there has been no contest in this proceeding to its proposition that there is no firm in the world more adverse to the Respondent and PDVSA and its affiliates than Macleod Dixon. It has continued to provide us with further information, publicly available, about those matters. In that context, the Respondent states that it has not had answers to the questions raised in its letter of 13 October, 2011 (*see* paragraph 9 above), with the exception of an answer by Mr. Fortier concerning his lack of involvement in the coordination of the international arbitration group of the combined firm and the business plan for promoting its expertise.64 That answer is set out in paragraph 44 above and his answer to a further question about arrangements with the combined firm in paragraph 48. We consider those particular answers later.\n\nResp. Oct. 24 Subm. at pp. 5-6; Resp. Final Obs. at pp. 1-2, 5 and 14.\n\n63.\n\nWe recall that the Claimants did not answer the questions put to them by the Respondent. They considered the information sought from them not to be relevant because Mr. Fortier\u2019s disclosures \"conclusively establish that he has never received information concerning Macleod Dixon\u2019s work for ConocoPhillips or against Venezuela, and also that [Mr.] Fortier will never be associated with Macleod Dixon\" (*see* paragraph 37 above). We come to the contentions relating specifically to Mr. Fortier later. For the moment it is enough for us to recognise the very extensive role of Macleod Dixon in Venezuela and its adverse position to the Respondent and PDVSA and its affiliates. We do not need answers to the questions addressed to that matter to be satisfied of that. Our concern is with any involvement which Mr. Fortier may have had within his firm on those matters and any knowledge which he had about them or ought to have had.\n\n64.\n\nMr. Fortier has stated in clear terms in his disclosure letter of 4 October, 2011 that:\n\nI have no knowledge of the issues raised in any of the above matters [about the legal services provided by the Caracas office or Macleod Dixon] and have had no communication regarding these matters other than as strictly required for the purposes of this disclosure.65\n\nHe also stated that he had not been involved in any way in the negotiation, that he had not taken part in or been privy to the plans for the international arbitration group in the combined firm, that he had no knowledge of any file, if any exists, on which lawyers from the two firms had been working together and he \"categorically\" stated that he had no involvement in any such file, nor had he been made privy to any information about any such file. Finally on this matter, he said that he had no knowledge of \"the breadth and significance of the matters adverse to the Respondent and PDVSA and its affiliates\" (the Respondent\u2019s phrase) almost a year earlier and that he was \"only apprised of the professional relationship between Macleod Dixon and ConocoPhillips later in the week of September 26\" (*see* paragraphs 41 and 44-46 above). We note that Mr. Fortier was not asked when he became aware of the \"breadth and significance\" of Macleod Dixon\u2019s practice adverse to the Respondent and PDVSA and its affiliates, or of any such adverse relationship.\n\n*See also* paragraphs 2, 4 and 41 above.\n\n65.\n\nWe have no reason to doubt the accuracy of those statements made by Mr. Fortier.\n\n66.\n\nTwo issues remain. The first is whether Mr. Fortier is in breach of his duty under Rule 6(b) of the Arbitration Rules to make reasonable enquiries into a possible conflict of interest arising from the merger discussions. The Respondent referred us to a decision which placed on the arbitrator a continuous duty of investigation, but the arbitrator was a director of a major international bank: any such arbitrator was required specifically to investigate whether the bank had any connection with or interest in any of the parties in pending arbitrations and also to notify the parties in each arbitration of such a connection or interest.66 In a second case, the duty was one arising from new employment and included the duty to inform the parties of that fact.67 The facts in this case are plainly different and the rulings in those cases inapplicable. The Respondent also referred us to \"a leading case\" from a US Federal Court of Appeals about the merger of a law firm, but that was a case of actual knowledge of a conflict of interest which the Court ruled should have been disclosed to the parties, again a very different case from this one.68\n\n*See* *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for Annulment of the Award rendered on 20 Aug. 2007, dated 10 Aug., 2010 at \u00b6\u00b6 217-228.\n\n*See New Regency Productions, Inc. v. Nippon Herald Films, Inc.*, 501 F.3d 1101 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\n*In re Eastern Sugar Antitrust Litigation*, 697 F.2d 524 (3d Cir. 1982).\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent says that big law firm mergers do not happen overnight and that due diligence, including conflict checks, takes place long before the decision to merge. It is also the case that proposals for mergers sometimes fail. We cannot see that, in the circumstances of this case, there is a sufficient basis for saying that at some point well before 4 October, Mr. Fortier knew or should have known the information in question and hence was under an obligation to disclose. There is no evidence before us on which such a finding could be based.\n\n68.\n\nIt follows that the Proposal for Disqualification is dismissed.\n\n**IV. CONCLUSION**\n------------------\n\n69.\n\nFor the reasons given, we decide that:\n\n1. The Respondent\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification of Mr. L. Yves Fortier as a member of this Tribunal is dismissed;\n\n2. Issues of costs relating to this Decision will be resolved at a later stage in this proceeding; and\n\n3.

I am therefore delivering the Opinion as it stands (*en l'\u00e9tat*), with some of it in form of outline, given that the possibility of filling it in is becoming increasingly moot, and bearing in mind the progress of the proceedings.\n\n3.\n\nThe opinion is in two parts. The first provides essential background that is skirted or only selectively covered in the Majority Decision. The second part consists of a critical analysis of the premises and reasoning of the Majority, spelling out the reasons of my dissent.\n\n**I - BACKGROUND**\n------------------\n\n**A - The Strategic Association Agreements**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nA preliminary question that underlies the whole issue of the negotiations over compensation for nationalization here under consideration - but which the Majority totally eschews and evacuates from its field of vision - is that of the definition *, i.e*. the identification of the legal nature and limits, of the investment protected by the BIT.\n\n5.\n\nTo answer this question, it is necessary to recall the historical origins of the relations between the Parties and the legal framework adopted by them to govern those relations, *i.e*. the Strategic Association Agreements (particularly their compensation clauses), and to clarify their relationship to the BIT.\n\n**1) *The elaboration and typology of the Strategic Association Agreements***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nWhen, at the beginning of the 1990's, Venezuela adopted the policy of \"*Opertura Petrolera\"*, it followed, in negotiating agreements with foreign oil companies, a general trend prevailing at the time in the oil sector. This trend was aptly analyzed by Thomas Waelde and George Noli, who noted in 1996 that :\n\n\"...in the last ten or twenty years, stabilization clauses have undergone a substantial evolution. In the main, contemporary stabilization commitments are negotiated with state enterprises rather than the state as such\"1.  \n They later on add :  \n \"[T]he predominant \u2018modern' stabilization clause no longer looks to the government as such, but makes the state enterprise responsible for unilateral intervention by its own government... The state company promises to compensate the foreign contractor should his financial burden increase due to subsequent government legislation. When viewed from this perspective, the function of the stabilization clause has been effectively converted from an instrument aimed at the government's legislative powers to a risk allocation mechanism in a purely - or mainly - commercial contract with the state company\"2.\n\nThomas Waelde and George Noli, Stabilizing International Investment Commitments : International Law Versus Contract Interpretation, 32 *Texas International Law Journal* (1996), 215 at 218.\n\n*Ibid.* 263-4.\n\n7.\n\nNegotiations along these lines took place between foreign oil companies, including the Claimants - Conoco at that stage, joined by Phillips to become ConocoPhillips (CP) later on - on one side, and the Venezuelan National Oil Company, PdVSA, through its subsidiaries Maraven and Corpoven that would constitute their national partners, on the other side, for the conclusion of Strategic Association Agreements for the exploitation of the extra-heavy oil of the Orinoco Belt.\n\n8.\n\nThe Venezuelan State accompanied these negotiations at one remove, as the ensuing agreements had to be approved by Parliament. In other words, the PdVSA subsidiaries had to get Congressional Authorization to sign them. The conditions that the Congress attaches to its authorization thus constitute parameters of the agreement and are automatically incorporated in it by reference or *renvoi*, apart from actual insertion.\n\n9.\n\nConoco insisted, during negotiations over the terms of the Congressional Authorization, on obtaining certain guarantees, namely a stabilization clause, full compensation for any harmful change of regulation or other prejudicial governmental action and detailed specification of the items of this compensation, as well as the methods of their evaluation in case of nationalization3.\n\nSee Letter from David Griffith, Conoco, Inc. to Alio Rojas (PdVSA subsidiary), Sept. 17, 1992, conveying Conoco's \"Comments on Conditions to Strategic Associations; Heavy Oil Project-Venezuela\" (the initial list of conditions of Congressional Authorization). *Comment on Condition 16* (on compensation by Maraven to foreign partner for harmful discriminatory governmental action or legislation, without prejudice to governmental legislative and regulatory sovereignty) : \"We would like full compensation based on market value, for any discriminatory law rule, or regulation... We would also like an economic stability clause... Finally, we will need to specifically address precisely how the assets and interest of Conoco will be valued and reimbursed in the event of nationalization\" (Ex-R.97).\n\n10.\n\nThese demands were flatly rejected by the Venezuelan party, and instead, the fiscal and regulatory government sovereignty was expressly safeguarded in the Congressional Authorizations, as well as transcribed in the Association Agreements themselves later on.\n\n11.\n\nHowever, the Congressional Authorizations made room for a measure of warranted security by allowing the PdVSA subsidiary to undertake in the Agreement to compensate itself the foreign partner for discriminatory harmful action by government, as well as (in the case of Hamaca) to exercise a buy-out option of the foreign partner's share in the Association in case of dispute over the occurrence of such action or the extent of compensation for it; all of which within clearly defined limits (both thresholds and caps), as discussed at greater length below.\n\n12.\n\nConoco accepted these conditions, including the compensation clauses, and was fully aware of their implications. In fact, these clauses largely followed formulae proposed by Conoco, which were quite favourable to it in the then prevailing economic circumstances.\n\n**2) *The compensation clauses in the Strategic Association Agreements with ConocoPhillips***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nWhat do the Association Agreements provide in case of government action, including new legislation, affecting the rights of foreign partners ? Cutting through the thickness of the texts, their provisions relating to changing laws or other acts of government affecting the rights of the foreign partner can be synthetically summarized as follows :\n\n14.\n\na) Nowhere in the Agreements is there a provision that can be interpreted directly or indirectly as a stabilization clause. On the contrary, the Congressional Authorizations are crystal clear in asserting the freedom of the Venezuelan State to legislate and act in full sovereignty; and that the Association Agreements do not impose limitations on this freedom nor give rise to any liability of the Venezuelan State or any claim against it by a party or a third party for its exercise of this freedom.\n\n15.\n\nThus, for example, the 19th Condition of the Hamaca Congressional Authorization provides :\n\n\"The Association Agreement, the creation and operation of the Entities and the other activities shall not impose any obligation on the Republic of Venezuela or restrict its exercise of sovereign rights, the exercise of which shall not give rise to any claim, regardless of the nature or characteristic of the same, by other States or foreign governments\"4.\n\nEx.R-93, see also the 21st Condition. Similarly, the 16th and 18th Conditions of the Petrozuata Congressional Authorization (Ex.R-92) and the 19th Condition of the Corocoro Congressional Authorization (Ex.R-94)\n\n16.\n\nb) In case of discriminatory governmental action prejudicial to the interest of the foreign partners in the Association, these partners are entitled to claim compensation from the local partner (i.e. the PdVSA subsidiary in the Association) provided that :\n\ni) the action is \"discriminatory\", i.e. not applicable to all similarly situated companies, particularly those in the oil industry; and\n\nii) it produces an \"unjust result\" by causing a \"significant material damage\", above a certain threshold (terms defined in the Agreements, as described below).\n\n17.\n\nThe compensation is calculated on the basis of complicated formulae with a digressive \"sliding scale\", inversely correlated to the price of Brent oil (i.e. the compensation diminishes as the Brent oil price increases), with a limit or a cap beyond which no compensation is due.\n\n18.\n\ni -Thus, the Petrozuata Association Agreement provides in Article 9/7 that if, as a result of Governmental \"discriminatory action\" (defined in Article 15), a Class B shareholder (the foreign partner) suffers a \"significant economic damage\" (also defined in Article 1, as amounting to at least 6.5.million 1994 US dollars in any fiscal year, which thus sets the threshold for compensation), it shall be compensated by the Class A shareholder, i.e. the PdVSA subsidiary. The compensation is calculated on the basis of digressive sliding scale inversely correlated or pegged to the price of a barrel of crude oil : below and up to 18,1994 US dollars the compensation is 100%, progressively diminishing to naught at the price of 25,1994 US dollars.\n\nThis definition corresponds to the generic meaning given in para. 16 above, but goes to great lengths enumerating what actions would fall under it as well as the exclusions *, i.e*. those actions that do not constitute discrimination.\n\n19.\n\nThere is also another cap or limit if the total damage for the fiscal year is greater than 75 million,1994 US dollars; in which case the foreign partner shall get the greater of a) either 25% (one quarter) of the actual damage; or b) the amount resulting from the application of the above formula. In case of dispute between the parties, Article 13 provides for ICC arbitration.\n\n20.\n\nii- Similarly, the Hamaca Association Agreement provides in its Article 14/2 that a governmental discriminatory action (defined at length in Article 14/1/b6) is \"unjust\" if it causes \"material adverse effect\" (i.e. beyond the threshold defined below) to a foreign partner; and that such an \"Affected Party\" shall be compensated by the local partner (the PdVSA subsidiary) within certain limits.\n\nSame as in the precedent note, but with even greater detail particularly of the exclusions, i.e. of what does not constitute discrimination\n\n21.\n\nThese limits are first a threshold of the loss, which must be, in any fiscal year, superior to 5% of the \"reference net cash flow\" for that year, compared to what it would have been in the absence of the discriminatory action.\n\n22.\n\nBut there is also a cap or upper limit, calculated on the basis of a complicated digressive formula which, as in the case of Petrozuata, is inversely correlated (or pegged) to the price of a barrel of crude Brent oil, that is triggered when that price averages 27,1996 US dollars over a period of three consecutive years. The maintenance of such high price for such a long period was thought practically unattainable at the time of the conclusion of the Agreement, as it had not been reached since records were kept, except once during the Iran-Iraq war. It was thus a formula highly favorable to Conoco at the time.\n\n23.\n\niii - If there is disagreement between the Parties (the PdVSA subsidiary and the foreign partner) over \"whether discriminatory actions resulting in material adverse effects occurred\", or on the amendments (of the Agreement to re-equilibrate it by compensating for the effects of the discriminatory action), the foreign partner can go to ICC arbitration. If the arbitral tribunal finds that there was indeed compensable discriminatory action, then at a second stage the local partner (PdVSA subsidiary), can exercise the option (instead of paying compensation on a continuous basis, if the discriminatory action had a continuous effect) of *buying out* the foreign partner's shares at a *buying out* price, to be determined by the arbitral tribunal, \"equal to the commercial value (without taking into account the effect of the Discriminatory Action, but *taking into account the provisions of Article XIV in respect to the Threshold Cash Flow)* of the Affected Party's Project Interest\"7. In other words, the *buying out price* also is subject to the same upper cap, inversely correlated to the price of crude Brent oil.\n\nArticle 14/4/c(B), emphasis added.\n\n24.\n\nWhat is remarkable in these complicated formulae is that compensation is not automatically correlated for example to the percentage change in the rates of royalty or taxes - which would have amounted to stabilization - but pegged inversely to the increase of the price of Brent oil, with an upper cap beyond which no compensation is due. This clearly indicates that their object and purpose was not the freezing of the regulatory framework, but a measure of guarantee of a reasonable rate of return on investment (12 to 15% for Petrozuata, according to the negotiations documentation), or of recovery of the initial investment in case of a buy out.\n\n**3) *The relationship between the Strategic Association Agreements and the BIT***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Strategic Association Agreements were negotiated and concluded well before ConocoPhillips transferred its interests in them into subsidiaries incorporated in the Netherlands in order to bring them under the protection of the BIT between Venezuela and the Netherlands.\n\n26.\n\nWhat can the treaty protect in law and does protect in fact ? In other words, what is the \"protected investment\" *in casu* ? Obviously, it is not the enterprise or project established by the Strategic Association Agreement as such - which is a joint venture between local and foreign partners - but the legal interests in the form of contractual rights that ConocoPhillips subsidiaries have in the enterprise, and which flow from and have as their legal title, the Strategic Association Agreement itself.\n\n27.\n\nThese legal interests or contractual rights have been established and their configuration, including their contents, scope and limits, defined by the Strategic Association Agreements well before the entry of the BIT into the picture. What can the BIT contribute to these already existing legal interests and rights ?\n\n28.\n\nClearly, any new rights or obligations attaching to an already existing investment in the form of contractual rights, which flow from sources extraneous to the contract that serves as legal title to the investment - such as a BIT or general international law (apart from *jus cogens* limitations) -come only as additional guarantees to buttress and reinforce the observance of the terms of the contract, but *in no circumstances* to revise or supplant them. In other words, the BIT can add to the protection of the contractual rights, but cannot change their configuration, *i.e*. their content, scope and limitations.\n\n29.\n\nTo assert, as does the Majority, that the treaty applies, without taking into consideration the terms of the contract, amounts to revising and rewriting the contract (the Association Agreement) by striking out or deleting some of the conditions or limitations that attach to ConocoPhillip's contractual rights, thus changing the dimensions of the protected investment.\n\n30.\n\nTo do so, whether in guise of legal reasoning or interpretation, is even more objectionable when, as *in casu*, the purported change in the dimension of the protected interests had been proposed by one party during the negotiation of the contract and flatly rejected by the other party; and where, instead, express terms - precisely those allegedly displaced by the treaty -were inserted in the contract, providing substantially different solutions to the contingencies constituting the subject-matter of the dispute.\n\n31.\n\nThis fundamental error is the result of a great confusion in the understanding of the distinction between treaty claims and contract claims (itself a controversial distinction), assuming that these two categories are hermetically separated.\n\n32.\n\nAt the risk of repetition, a treaty claim is necessarily based on a right that has been allegedly violated. If this right is created by contract, it is this contract that governs its legal existence and the modalities of this existence, including its contents and limits.\n\n33.\n\nThe treaty claim cannot skirt or by-pass the configuration of this right or some of the conditions or limits of its existence; according to its legal title, the contract, as this right, in its fixed legal configuration, serves as the legal basis underlying the treaty claim. A treaty claim cannot allege a violation of a right, while ignoring the specific legal limits of this right. The treaty may provide added remedies for its possible violations, but the underlying right subject to these violations is defined exclusively by its legal title that governs its existence.\n\n34.\n\nIt clearly follows from the preceding analysis that the calculation of the \"market value\" of the nationalized investment *in casu* - consisting of contractual rights flowing from the Strategic Association Agreements, that constitute their legal title - has necessarily to take into account (i.e. to pass by or be filtered through) the compensation clauses of these Agreements which qualify and limit those rights protected by the BIT.\n\n35.\n\nThis conclusion rests not only on legal, but also on economic grounds. The Claimants, in their Memorial, define \"fair market value\" as :\n\n\"...the price [at which] a willing buyer would buy given goods. and the price at which a willing seller would sell... on condition that none of the two parties [is] under any kind of duress and that both parties have good information about all relevant circumstances involved in the purchase\"8.\n\nClaimants' Memorial (15 September 2008), para. 397. This definition is an adaptation of that given by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal *, Starrett Co. v.Iran, Bank Markazi et al*., 16 Iran-US C.T.R.112\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimants also cite the American Society of Appraisers definition of \"fair market value\" as\n\n\"the price... at which property would change hands between a hypothetical and able buyer and a hypothetical willing and able seller, acting at an arm's length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither is under compulsion to buy or sell and when both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts\"9.\n\nAmerican Society of Appraisers, *The International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms*, (2005), p. 4, cited in Claimants Memorial, para. 397, fn.591.\n\n37.\n\nProceeding from these definitions, how can any *homo economicus* exercising rational choice as a \"willing buyer\" of ConocoPhillips shares or contractual rights in the Strategic Association Agreements, calculate the price he would be willing to pay, without factoring in (or taking into account) the terms of the compensation clauses of the Agreements ? Would it be rational and economically sound to ignore, in his economic calculation, the limits of what he would be entitled to get, according to the Agreements, in case of a dispute with the local partner over what he would consider as State harmful discriminatory action; or disregard the buy-out price at which the local partner can in such a case acquire his interest in the project, according to the Agreement ?\n\n38.\n\nObviously, given the legal and economic reasons expounded above, the calculation of the \"fair market value\" of ConocoPhillips interests in the Strategic Associations, has to \"pass-by\" or rather cannot \"by-pass\", the compensation clauses in the Association Agreements.\n\n39.\n\nThe cardinal error of the Majority Decision, in my submission, is precisely to have evacuated completely these compensation clauses from its reasoning, for no valid objective reason, in order to reach the conclusion it seeks, as shall be shown below (para.134ff)\n\n**B - Negotiations on Migration and Compensation**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Majority describes and analyses the process of these negotiations in paragraphs 382-402 of the Decision. Two reasons impel me to revisit this process. The first is that the Majority's narrative is rather selective, relying very heavily and uncritically on the pleadings and testimonies of the Claimants and their witnesses, while passing over certain elements of significance for the proper understanding of the position of the Respondent and his main witness, Dr. Mommer.\n\n41.\n\nThe second reason for revisiting here the process of negotiations is the adoption by the Majority of a confusing grid of analysis of this process as stretching over two overlapping periods10, leaving room for false impressions and implications.\n\nDecision of 3 September 2013 (hereinafter cited as \"Decision\"), para. 363 : \u00ab The evidence relates to two overlapping periods, the first, from 2006 to early 2007, concerning the proposed migration of the projects to *empresas mixtas* and the second concerning the negotiations both before the taking of the investments, in June 2007, and beyond\". See below, para. 87ff.\n\n42.\n\nThere are indeed two phases, or rather two sets of virtually different negotiations, that should be analytically clearly disentangled. For they are hardly overlapping either in time or in their subject-matter. The first covers negotiations over the possibilities and conditions of \"migration\". It started in 2006 and extended formally until the issue of Decree-Law 5,200 on 26 February 2007. The second phase covers negotiations on compensation for the relinquishment by ConocoPhillips of its interests in the projects, i.e. for \"nationalization\" proper. It started with the issue of Decree-Law 5,200 and extended well into 200811.\n\nIn reality, the watershed point beyond the date of the issue of Decree-Law 5,200. It was the first meeting after the issue of the Decree-Law on 29 March 2007 in which the Parties discussed concretely for the first time compensation for nationalization, and a figured offer was made.\n\n**1) *Negotiations on Migration***\n----------------------------------\n\n**a) Origins of \"migration\"**\n-----------------------------\n\n43.\n\nArticle 97 of Venezuela\u2019s Constitution of 1961 provides :\n\n\"The State may reserve certain industries, exploitations or services of public interest for reasons of national interest, and shall foster the creation and development of a basic heavy industry under its control\".12\n\nThis provision contemplated mainly the hydrocarbon industry.\n\nEx-R.95.\n\n44.\n\nParallel to the nationalization of the hydrocarbon sector in the 1970's (with all claims arising therefrom settled by agreement), Venezuela adopted in 1975 the so-called \"Nationalization Law\" regulating this sector and reserving, in its Article 1, to the State the industry and trade of oil.\n\n45.\n\nArticle 5 of the Law - referring to the possible role of the private sector, including foreign oil companies - provided :\n\n\"1) The State shall carry out the activities indicated in Article 1 of this Law directly through the National Executive or through state-owned entities, being able to enter into operating agreements necessary for the better performance of its functions, but in no case shall such transactions affect the essence of the reserved activities.\n\n2) In special cases and if convenient for the public interest, the National Executive or such entities may, in the exercise of any of the indicated activities, enter into association agreements with private entities, with a participation that guarantees control on the part of the State and with a specified duration. The execution of such agreements shall require the prior authorization of the [Congressional] Chambers in joint session, within the conditions that they establish, once they have been duly informed by the National Executive of all the pertinent circumstances\"13.\n\nEx-R.19.\n\n46.\n\nIn other words, paragraph 1 alludes to the possibility for the concerned public entities to conclude \"service\" or \"operating agreements\" with private entities, within the strictly fixed parameters of the law; while paragraph 2 permits in \"special cases\" the responsible public entities \"to enter into association agreements\" with private entities, including foreign companies, whose terms can vary, with \"Congressional Authorization\".\n\n47.\n\nWhen  Venezuela adopted the policy of \"Apertura Petrolera\" at the beginning of the 1990's, it negotiated with foreign or international oil companies several types of agreements.\n\na) For the extra-heavy oil of the Orinoco Belt, it negotiated four \"Strategic Association Agreements\" with Congressional Authorization, thus falling under the exception of the \"special cases\" of paragraph 2 of Article 5 of the \"Nationalization Law\" of 1975, including the Petrozuata and later on the Hamaca Association Agreements, as described above.\n\nb) Venezuela also concluded eight \"Exploration at Risk and Profit sharing Agreements\", also with Assembly authorization; thus legally falling under the category of \"special cases\" of paragraph 2 of Article 5 of the 1975 \"Nationalization Law\"; including the Corocoro Agreement with ConocoPhillips and other companies.\n\nc) Finally, Venezuela concluded a large number (32) of \"Operating Services Agreements\" without Congressional Authorization, under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the 1975 \"Nationalization Law\", which does not require such authorization, as these agreements involve only the provision of services, for a fee, and not any participation in equity or profits.\n\n48.\n\nAfter the election of President Chavez, the \"Nationalization Law\" of 1975 was replaced by the \"Organic Hydrocarbons Law\" No. 1,503 of 200114. One of the main differences between the two laws is that the latter did not reproduce some of the exceptions provided for in the 1975 law, particularly under Article 5, paragraph 2 of that law (the \"special cases\") concerning the participation of foreign entities in the oil sector through joint ventures with national public companies. These exceptions permitted the waiver, with Congressional Authorization, of the general requirement that the public sector local partner control the operations (\"operatorship\") and the majority equity interest in these joint ventures.\n\nEx-R.18.\n\n49.\n\nThe 2001 Law was not applied retrospectively to those joint ventures based on these exceptions, but which were established legally under the old 1975 Law, with Congressional Authorization.\n\n50.\n\nThis was not, however, the case of the large number of the \"Operating Services Agreements\" (OSA). They did not need special authorization, because the foreign entities were supposed simply to provide service for a fee (Article 5/1 of the 1975 Law). However, according to Dr. Mommer, after the \"Apertura Petrolera\", this form of agreement was used to cover arrangements of participation in profits or delegation of \"operatorship\" to foreign entities.15\n\nDirect Testimony of Dr. Bernard Mommer (24 July 2009), para. 6.\n\n51.\n\nThus, when the Government re-examined them in 2005, they were considered illegal. The Government negotiated with the foreign partners in these 32 foreign projects for *conversion* of these \"Operating Services Agreements\" into *impreses mixtas* or *joint ventures* compatible with the prescriptions of the \"Organic Hydrocarbons Law\" of 2001. This process of *conversion* or *novation* is what has been termed \"migration\" (from one type of association to another).\n\n52.\n\nAgreement was reached on the migration with 30 out of the 32 foreign companies involved. Of the remaining two, one preferred to withdraw with agreed compensation, while the remaining company ENI resorted to arbitration, but the case was settled before the constitution of the tribunal16.\n\n*Ibid*. para 7. ENI was also the partner of ConocoPhillips in the Corocoro project. But unlike its partner, ENI agreed to the migration of that project.\n\n**b) Negotiations on Voluntary Migration, 2006**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nAccording to Dr. Mommer, in light of the successful conclusion of the migration of the \"Operating Services Agreements\" into *impresas mixtas* that started in 2005 :\n\n\"[i]n the second half of 2006, the idea of negotiated migration of the associations emerged. I held several meetings with project participants individually to discuss *possible structures and incentives* for restructuring the projects into mixed companies with expansion of opportunities which would improve the economics of the projects while bringing them into conformity with the 2001 \u2018Organic Hydrocarbons Law', [Dr. Mommer immediately adds the following comment] but ConocoPhillips was not interested in these concepts\".17\n\n*Ibid.* para. 13. Emphasis added.\n\n54.\n\nIt is to be noted that as Venezuela recognized that the Association Agreements (unlike the OSA) were legally established on the basis of Congressional Authorization, these meetings were an invitation to treat; to renegotiate freely a contract. According to Dr. Mommer again, there was no question of nationalization at that stage, but merely the exploration of the possibility of reconfiguring the contracts, i.e the Association Agreements.18\n\nTranscript of Oral Hearings 31 May-12 June, 21-23 July 2010 (hereinafter cited as \"Transcript\"), p. 1905.\n\n55.\n\nThe narrative of these negotiations by the Claimants is totally different. Thus, Mr. Lyons describes them as follows :\n\n\"...in August 2006, PdVSA sent term sheets to ConocoPhillips for the \u2018migration' of its two extra-heavy crude Projects, Petrozuata and Hamaca, to *empresas mixtas* (Exhibit C-231; Exhibit C-232). Although the terms of the proposed transition were not fully spelled out in the two-page term sheets, they clearly showed that Venezuela intended to take the existing interests of ConocoPhillips in those Projects, and offer in return a diminished stake and rights in the new *empresas mixtas*. The term sheets also demanded that we waive any claims in relation to nationalization. Those terms were unacceptable to us, as we made clear in discussions with Dr. Del Pino and Bernard Mommer, the Vice-Minister of Hydrocarbons, during the Fall of 2006\"19.\n\nLyons, Witness Statement (10 September 2008), para.6 ; see also Claimants Memorial, para. 227-228.\n\n56.\n\nHowever, a cursory look at the non-binding term sheets sent by PdVSA reveals a totally different picture from that portrayed by Mr. Lyons. Thus, for example, for Petrozuata, the Term sheet (Ex.C-232) provided (in Article 1) that \"The current project is divided in two parts\" (1) a primary activity Mixed Company incorporated according to Article 33 of the Hydrocarbon Organic Law, i.e. PdVSA owning a minimum of 51% and ConocoPhillips no more than 49% (Article 2); which \"will be the operator of the production of heavy and extra-heavy crude oil\" (Article 3); and (2) an upgrading mixed company, in which PdVSA can be a minority shareholder (Article 2); the up grader can be operated by this mixed company or by ConocoPhillips (Article 3).\n\n57.\n\nPdVSA (which already held 49.9% of the Strategic Association of Petrozuata) was thus offering to buy less than 1% of ConocoPhillips 50% shares in the Association. This of course meant a change in the majority (only for the production, not the upgrading). But the counter-part was a significant expansion of the project : lifting the limits on the size of production and authorizing the expansion of the upgrading to almost the double, etc. ConocoPhillips would thus become a slightly junior partner in a much larger project.\n\n58.\n\nIn the words of Dr. Mommer,\n\n\"... until the end of 2006, we worked on the idea that we would have a negotiated transition in each case, doubling the project or finding ways to increase the total so that there was indeed, a *win-win situation...* There was no idea of forced migration, which was called nationalization. Up to then, it was negotiating, it was offering additional value, but also requiring to give up certain points.\".20\n\nTranscript, p. 1905, emphasis added.\n\n59.\n\nNeither the Claimants narrative nor that of the Majority gives any attention to these incentives offered as counter-part for this proposed \"negotiated migration\"; making it sound like a unilateral diktat of divestment.\n\n60.\n\nAnyway, legally speaking, as the object of these exchanges was a proposed conversion or a novation, i.e. a proposed revision of the Strategic Agreements on a voluntary basis, it would be a patent mischaracterization to present them, as does the Majority, as negotiations over nationalization (following in that uncritically Mr. Lyons\u2019s description and assessment that it largely reproduces in paragraph 382 of the Decision, and builds upon later).\n\n**c) Negotiations on Compulsory Migration, January 2007**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nShortly after his reelection in December 2006, President Chavez announced on 8 January 2007 his new program of \"nationalization\". But, as explained by Dr. Mommer, \"nationalization in this context meant assuming control over the operations through majority ownership in mixed companies\"21. However, the details of this program were specified later on, in Decree-Law No. 5,200, promulgated on 26 February 2007.\n\nMommer's Direct Testimony, para.14.\n\n62.\n\nWhilst this announcement marked a substantial shift in the legal object of the negotiations, from voluntary to compulsory migration to *empresas mixtas* with government majority ownership, it left room for negotiating the other details and modalities of this transition, as explained below.\n\n63.\n\nNegotiations started well before the promulgation of Decree-Law 5,200, on the basis of a model agreement sent by the Venezuelan Government to the foreign partners in the Associations. The Venezuelan Government sent to ConocoPhillips two draft migration contracts for the Petrozuata and the Hamaca Associations on 17 and 19 January 2007 (C-31 and C-32), on which turned the meeting of 31st January, which is reported in Mr. Lyons's witness statement between himself and another ConocoPhillips executive on one side, and Dr. Mommer and several PdVSA officials on the other.\n\n64.\n\nAccording to Mr. Lyons, \"At that meeting, we made clear that the terms being offered to compensate ConocoPhillips for relinquishing its rights in the existing Projects and migrating to the *empresas mixtas* regime were inadequate. *Vice-Minister Mommer made clear, however, that the* *government did not intend to modify these terms.* In the circumstances, as a protective measure, we provided to the government trigger letters\".22\n\nLyons' Witness Statement, para.9 ; emphasis added.\n\n65.\n\nThere was in fact only one letter covering the three projects which, after presenting ConocoPhillilps' contentions and claims, concludes as follows:\n\n\"ConocoPhillips consequently formally notifies Venezuela in writing of the existence of a dispute in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the Foreign Investment Law.  \n In light of *Venezuela stated intention not to negotiate the terms of expropriation with ConocoPhillips*, ConocoPhillips reserves the right to submit the dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the Foreign Investment Law...\". Signed Albert Roy Lyons, dated 31 January 2007.23\n\nEx-C.36; emphasis added.\n\n66.\n\nThe Majority adds at this juncture, after citing Mr. Lyons's testimony and the trigger letter :\n\n\"Dr. Mommer in cross-examination said he did not think that was the breakpoint in the negotiations. The blanks in the model contracts remained negotiable as the success of the negotiations with the other Parties to the Association Agreements showed (1850-51)\".24\n\nDecision, para. 385. What Dr. Mommer said exactly was that the \"model [more than 50% Venezuelan ownership] was not negotiable. But there were blanks in the model, and they were.negotiable\". Transcript, p.1851.\n\n67.\n\nIndeed, it is difficult to see on what basis could Mr. Lyons write \"ViceMinister Mommer made clear... that the government did not intend to modify these terms\", when a cursory look at the draft conversion (migration) contracts (Ex.C-31 and C-32) reveal that the only fixed number figuring in them is that of the ownership by the Government or by companies or entities owned by it, being more than 50% of the capital stock of the mixed company (Article 1.3) (the drafts, as well as the meeting of 31 January pre-dated Decree-Law No.5.200 which fixed the Government's share at 60%). There is no other mention of sums, the size of designated areas and other important items, which were left open for negotiations. Nor was there obviously, any mention of nationalization or *a fortiori* of compensation, the purpose of the draft contracts being the \"migration\" or conversion of the Strategic Associations into *empresas mixtas*, not the total withdrawal of the foreign partners from them.\n\n68.\n\nNor can the reference in the trigger letters to \"Venezuela's stated intention not to negotiate the terms of its expropriation with ConocoPhillips\" be based on what was said during the meeting of 31st January 2007, as these letters were obviously prepared before hand, to be delivered on that occasion.25\n\nLyons' Winess Statement, para. 9.\n\n69.\n\nIt is clear, in my submission, on the basis of the record at our disposal, that at this juncture, i.e. on 31st January 2007, Venezuela was still trying to reach a \"negotiated migration\", *i.e*. the conversion of the Strategic Associations into *empresas mixtas*, with national majority holding, by providing incentives to the foreign partners (expansion of the volume of production, of the designated area, of the types of activities, etc.) through the negotiations of the blanks or dotted lines in the draft conversion contracts. But ConocoPhillips was \"not interested\" in the concept of \"migration\" itself, hence was not very interested in negotiating the details of the \"blanks\" in the model contracts.26 It was speaking instead of nationalization meaning its total withdrawal from the projects or the relinquishment of the totality of its interests in them to the Government. A subject that was not broached in the draft conversion contracts as for Venezuela at that point of time, the subject-matter of negotiations was still the \"migration\".\n\nMommer's Direct Testimony, para. 13; Transcript, p. 1855.\n\n70.\n\nOn 26 February 2006, Decree-Law No.5.200 was promulgated, specifying the details of President Chavez's \"nationalization program\", to bring all joint ventures with foreign companies in the hydrocarbon sector in line with the Organic Hydrocarbon Law of 2001. In short, it mandates the conversion (or migration) of all such existing joint ventures into *empresas mixtas*, in which the national partner (PdVSA affiliate) controls the \"operatorship\" as well as at least 60% of the equity ownership; and gives the partners four months to negotiate the details of the migration within these parameters. Beyond this time limit, if no agreement is reached, the Government would enforce the \"migration\".\n\n71.\n\nThis time limit was set only for reaching agreement on the conversion of the Strategic Associations into *empresas mixtas*. It obviously did not apply to negotiations on compensation for \"nationalization\" in the classical sense of the term, in case the parties failed to reach agreement on migration within the prescribed 4 months time limit, and the foreign partner chose to withdraw totally from the project.\n\n**2) *Negotiations on Compensation for Nationalization***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nAfter the promulgation of Decree-Law 5,200 in February 2007, negotiations turned essentially on compensation for nationalization. The record shows, confirmed by declarations of representatives of both parties, that these negotiations continued well into 2008. This phase can be divided in turn into three sub-periods :\n\na) before the lapse of the time limit for migration\n\nb) after the lapse of the time limit, until the initiation of the present arbitration on 2 November 2007\n\nc) after the start of the present arbitration\n\n**a) Negotiations before the lapse of the time limit for migration**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe first sub-period is mainly characterized by an offer made by Venezuela, in a meeting of 29 March, which is reported in Mr. Lyons' Witness Statement (paragraphs 12-14) and in three letters (identical ones for each project) dated April 12, 2007 (Ex.C241) sent by Mr. Lyons to Dr. Mommer and PdVSA representatives. Both Mr. Lyons' Statement and the letters are abundantly quoted by the Majority (para. 388-391).\n\n74.\n\nThe offer, according to Mr. Lyons and the letters, consists of two alternatives :\n\ni - In case ConocoPhillips accepts to participate in the migration, it would have to transfer to the PdVSA subsidiaries 10.1% of its 50.1% shares in Petrozuata, and roughly 17% of its 40% shares in Hamaca, in exchange of which it would receive US$ 100 millions for Petrozuata,and US$ 370 millions for Hamaca.\n\nii - For the total relinquishment by ConocoPhillips of its interests in the two projects, ConocoPhillips is offered US$ 1.1 billions for Petrozuata and US$ 1.2 billions for Hamaca.27\n\nLyons Witness Statement, para. 12.\n\n75.\n\nIt is interesting to note (as does the Majority in para. 390) the comment of the Claimants' Memorial that this offer \"represented no more than 5% of the real value of the Claimants' investments\".28 But if 2.3 billion US dollars are only 5% of the value, this means that the Claimants value their interests at 46 billion dollars.\n\nClaimants Memorial, para. 309.\n\n76.\n\nMr. Lyons writes in his Statement :\n\n\"We told Mr. Del Pino and Vice-Minister Mommer that these offers were far below the fair market value of our interests in the Projects. Vice-Minister Mommer responded that compensation would not be based on fair market value\".29\n\nLyons Witness Statement, para. 13.\n\n77.\n\nThe three identical letters of 12 April 2007, after describing Venezuela's compensation proposals, add :\n\n\"We were informed during this meeting [of 29 March] that the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela would not compensate ConocoPhillips for the fair market value of its interests...Please confirm that our understanding of the... Government... proposals as stated above is accurate and complete and further that the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela is willing to consider alternative compensation proposals as discussed in the March 31, 2007 meeting. As noted by Mr. Muleva on March 31, 2007, any valuation based upon book value would neither adequately compensate ConocoPhillips for the... Government unilateral changes in commercial terms (royalty and taxes) over the past several years, nor for the additional changes resulting from the Nationalization Decree\".30\n\nEx-C241.\n\n78.\n\nAfter citing extensively the common argumentative parts of these letters, the Majority concludes \"neither the Venezuelan Government nor PdVSA replied to these letters\".31\n\nDecision, para. 391\n\n79.\n\nIt is true that one cannot find a direct written reply to these letters (and their queries) in the documents submitted to the Tribunal by the date it issued its Decision (3 September 2012);32 that is if one does not take into account the testimony of Dr. Mommer, the principal Venezuelan negotiator. For, as the Majority remarks, in the following paragraph :\n\n\"Dr. Mommer in cross-examination twice testified in response to Mr. Lyons\u2019 testimony, that he did not think he had said to the Conoco Philipps representatives that compensation would not be based on market value\".33\n\nIn fact, there was a written response to the three ConocoPhilipps letters of 12 April 2007, in the form of a letter sent the following day, the 13th of April 2007, by Dr. Mommer to Mr. Lyons. But this letter was not before the Tribunal when it took its Decision. See \"Letter from Bernard Mommer to Albert Lyons dated April 13, 2007\", figuring as Annex 2 to \"Respondent\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated September 8, 2013\".\n\nDecision, para. 392\n\n80.\n\nThe Majority, however, hastens to dismiss Dr. Mommer\u2019s response by adding immediately: \"Against that general denial, made only at the hearings and not in the two rounds of written testimony, the Tribunal notes the contrary written testimony of Mr. Lyons\".34\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 393\n\n81.\n\nThis perfunctory account by the Majority of Dr. Mommer\u2019s response is both incomplete and incorrect. It is so fragmentary as to verge on misrepresentation when it encapsulates Dr. Mommer\u2019s response in the sheepish and defensive phrase that \"he did not think that he had said\" what Mr. Lyons attributed to him.\n\n82.\n\nWhat Dr. Mommer did actually say, when the question was first put to him, was an emphatic \"I don't think I ever said something like that\".35 And the Majority omits reporting his more forceful and forthright answer when asked the same question a little while later : \"I think that witness statement [Lyons] is incorrect\".36\n\nTranscript, p. 1858.\n\n*Ibid*, p. 1862.\n\n83.\n\nMore serious still about the Majority's rendering of Dr. Mommer's testimonies is its factual incorrectness. It faults both by omission and by commission when it affirms that Dr. Mommer's refutation of Mr. Lyons' witness statement was \"made only at the hearings and not in the two rounds of written testimony\".37\n\nDecision, para. 393\n\n84.\n\nIt thus passes over Dr. Mommer's (first written) Direct Testimony, of 24 July 2009 (almost a year before the oral hearings), in which he roundly addresses these allegations, in paragraph 20 ; a paragraph that the Majority had paradoxically cited a little earlier in paragraph 385 of its Decision, and which reads :\n\n\"ConocoPhilipps' argument that the Republic never offered to discuss reasonable compensation in connection with the migration is also untrue. At first, we hoped that the ConocoPhillips companies would join the migration. When they refused, we tried in good faith to reach an amicable settlement, as we had done successfully before with other companies. I was present in the settlement discussions with the ConocoPhillips representatives. We were always open to paying reasonable compensation, but ConocoPhillips from the beginning insisted on exorbitant sums that made settlement impossible\".38\n\nMommer's Direct Testimony, para. 20.\n\n85.\n\nLargely on the basis of its truncated and factually erroneous account of Dr. Mommer's testimonies, the Majority, premising that Venezuela \"had not responded in any meaningful way to the points made about the negotiations, in particular in those letters [of 12 April 2007]\", reaches the conclusion \"that Venezuela at that time was not negotiating in good faith by reference to the standard of \"market value\" set out in the BIT... \".39\n\nDecision, para. 394.\n\n86.\n\nThis conclusion is vitiated by a number of serious errors of fact and law, not to mention the series of unverified assumptions the Majority had to make in order to reach or rather jump to this conclusion, in particular the assumption that the Respondent had the obligation, beyond making a reasonable offer of fair compensation, to negotiate compensation in good faith with the Claimants, by reference to the standard of \"market value\" set out in Article 6(c) of the BIT, as interpreted by the Claimants, as well as the implied finding of the Majority that the offer of compensation of 29 March 2007 is so inadequate as to amount to a refusal to pay compensation. These assumptions and findings are discussed in some detail in Part II of this Opinion; with one exception relating specifically to the analysis of the process of negotiations; and thus better suited to be discussed at this juncture.\n\n87.\n\nThis exception concerns a serious error flowing from the artificial and confusing grid of analysis used by the Majority,40 that represents the process of negotiations between the Parties as stretching over \"two overlapping periods, the first from 2006 to early 2007, concerning the proposed migration... and the second from early 2007 concerning the negotiations both before the taking of the investments in June 2007, and beyond\"41, turning obviously on compensation for nationalization.\n\nSee above para. 41-42.\n\nDecision, para. 363.\n\n88.\n\nThe Majority portrays these negotiations as a series of rounds of exchanges between the Parties. It is clear from the Majority's narrative that it considers the offers made by the Respondent in the meeting of 29 March 2007 and their rejection by ConocoPhilipps, particularly in the three identical letters dated 12 April 2007, as constituting the last round of exchanges that closes the first period (leading immediately to its conclusion in paragraph 394 based exclusively on the absence of response by Venezuela to these letters, that Venezuela at that time was not negotiating in good faith).42\n\nDecision, para. 394. That this conclusion relates to what the Majority considers \"the first period of negotiations\" is clearly demonstrated by the opening sentence of the immediately following paragraph 395 of the Decision : \"The Tribunal now turns to the evidence concerning the negotiations from April 2007 before and after the taking of assets\"\n\n89.\n\nIn fact, however, this round of exchanges, in which for the first time compensation was specifically addressed and a quantified offer made by the Respondent, was very marginally related to the first period of negotiations dealing exclusively with migration.\n\n90.\n\nThe only link this round had with the first period of negotiations was the minor of the two alternatives in the offer made by the Respondent at the meeting of 29 March 2007, consisting of the price it proposed for the limited amount of shares that ConocoPhilipps would have had to transfer to their local partners in the two Associations of Petrozuata and Hamaca, within the framework of an agreed migration, to conform to the requirements of Law No.1.503 of 2001. But given the lack of enthusiasm of ConocoPhilipps for (not to say interest in) migration from the beginning, all the attention and efforts were focused on the second alternative, namely compensation for the withdrawal of ConocoPhilipps, or its relinquishment of the totality of its interests in the projects, *i.e*. compensation for nationalization.\n\n91.\n\nIn other words, this round did not represent the closure of the first period of negotiations as portrayed by the Majority, but the beginning of the second period of negotiations which turned on compensation for nationalization.\n\n92.\n\nThis is not a moot question or an innocent and inconsequential confusion, given the far-reaching conclusions the Majority draws from it. This is because reaching the conclusion that a party was negotiating in bad faith requires the observation and scrutiny of the process of negotiations over a certain lapse of time sufficient for the Tribunal to detect a pattern of conduct that clearly reveals - leaving no room for doubt - that the concerned party was not negotiating in good faith.\n\n93.\n\nRepresenting the meetings of 29 and 31 March and the three letters of 12 April 2007 as the last of a series of rounds belonging to the first period of negotiations that started in mid 2006 (rather than the first round of a new period of negotiations over compensation for nationalization) makes it logically possible for the Majority to insinuate (or make us assume) that it had detected such a pattern from conduct of Venezuela, throughout the first period of negotiations; a necessary logical premise for its finding that \"Venezuela at that time [ *i.e*. \"12 April 2007, the date of those letters\"] was not negotiating in good faith by reference to the standard of \u2018market value' set out in the BIT\".43\n\nDecision, para. 394.\n\n94.\n\nApart from the serious legal problem raised by the cavalier manner in which the Majority jumps to this conclusions,44 the conclusion in itself is patently absurd. This is because all the negotiations during the first period in 2006 and 2007 until the meeting of 29 March, turned on seeking mutually acceptable conditions for migration. Even after the reelection of President Chavez and the announcement of his nationalization program in January 2007, which rendered migration compulsory, efforts continued in search for mutually acceptable conditions within the parameters of that program (of national equity majority and operatorship). Thus during all this period of negotiations there was no room for, nor mention of compensation for nationalization, which was not the subject of negotiation; nor were there any sums proposed to be gauged by, or against any standard of compensation. How can then anyone extract from such negotiations any pattern of conduct that is evaluated according to its correspondence to a certain standard of compensation.\n\nThe insinuation and the assumption it carries - of a pattern of conduct revealing bad faith on the part of Venezuela - is made by the Majority without proving at any length its substance as expected and required by international law for the grave accusation of bad faith, according to the exacting standard of proof restated by the Tribunal itself earlier in the same Decision when the allegation of bad faith was addressed to the Claimants (Decision, para. 275 : \" It [The Tribunal] will do that bearing in mind how rarely courts and tribunals have held that a good faith or other related standard is breached. The standard is a high one\". More on this further below.\n\n95.\n\nEven if one accepts *arguendo* the misplacement into the first period of negotiations of the round opened with the Venezuelan offers of 29 March 2007 and its formal rejection in the three letters of 12 April 2007, this round would still be the only relevant episode during the whole first period of negotiations, for assessing the conduct of Venezuela in relation to compensation, as it is the only round where an offer, in fact the initial offer, was made and turned down.\n\n96.\n\nHow can anyone (not to mention seasoned arbitrators) jump from the mere making of the very first offer of compensation by Venezuela to the conclusion that, from the starting blocks, Venezuela was not negotiating in good faith? A conclusion that requires the scrutiny of the whole process of negotiations over compensation, not merely the first act or shot in such a process. Apparently, in its haste to reach the conclusion it seeks, the Majority put the cart before the horse.\n\n**b) Negotiations around and after the lapse of the time limit set for compulsory migration.**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Majority considers that the second period of negotiations, turning on compensation for nationalization, started after the three letters of ConocoPhilipps of 12 April 2007. Thus, in paragraph 395 of the Decision, after stating that \"The Tribunal now turns to... the negotiations from April 2007 before and after the taking of the assets\", it proceeds, in the same paragraph, to quote Dr. Mommer on ConocoPhillips' counter offer of June 2007. However, for the reasons already given, I consider that this classification is wrong and that the negotiations on compensation started with the Venezuelan offer of 29 March 2007 and its rejection by ConocoPhilipps in the three letters of 12 April 2007. The following thus constitutes the second round of these negotiations over compensation.\n\n98.\n\nA few days before the deadline set by Decree-Law 5,200 for enforcing compulsory migration (12 June 2007), ConocoPhilipps put forward a counter offer, reported by Dr. Mommer, in the form of a \"Draft Memorandum of understanding\" dated 15 June 2007 for an \"Exchange of Assets\". According to this proposal, ConocoPhilipps subsidiaries would relinquish all their interests in the Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro projects, in exchange of the interests of PdVSA subsidiaries in two refineries in the US, whose appraised value at the time was approximately 8.2 billion US dollars.45\n\nDr. Mommer\u2019s Direct Testimony, para. 21 and Appendix 4 (the Draft Memorandum of Understanding).\n\n99.\n\nDr. Mommer does not relate Venezuela\u2019s response, if any, to this offer; but reports that two months later (i.e. after the taking over of the projects), by a letter dated 17 August 2007, ConocoPhilipps made a new proposal. That letter starts with the following sentence: \"ConocoPhilipps appreciates the verbal compensation proposal made to Roy Lyons on Monday, August 13, 2007\";46 signifying that Venezuela had made a new offer beyond that of 29 March 2007.\n\n*Ibid.* Appendix 5.\n\n100.\n\nConocoPhilipps\u2019 letter put forward a counter-offer, maintaining the formerly proposed exchange of assets, but adding to it the sum of one and a half billion dollars that it would pay to Venezuela, atop its interests in the three projects, in exchange for the interests of PdPVSA\u2019s subsidiaries in the two US refineries. In other words, it valued its interests in the three projects at 6.7 billion USdollars. But this was still considered exorbitant by Venezuela.\n\n101.\n\nAccording to Dr. Mommer, this offer was \"completely unrealistic because it gave no consideration to the compensation formulae that had been negotiated and agreed at the outset of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects, and did not even reflect the true value of the interests at issue without considering those formulae\".47\n\nMommer\u2019s Direct Testimony, para. 22.\n\n102.\n\nSignificantly, no mention of this counter-offer, whether in its initial or revised form, appears in any of ConocoPhilipps\u2019 written or oral pleadings. Nor was it mentioned by Mr. Lyons or any other ConocoPhilipps' witness.\n\n**c) Negotiations after the initiation of the present arbitration**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal did not dispose of any direct information on offers or counter-offers in the negotiations between the parties after the initiation of the present arbitration on the 2nd of November 2007. To be noted in this regard, that witnesses of both sides invoked a \"confidentiality agreement\" concerning negotiations after the start of arbitration (to be discussed at some length below).\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal knew for certain, however, that negotiations continued well into 2008, via concordant public statements in February 2008 of both Mr. James Muleva, the CEO of ConocoPhilipps48 and the Venezuelan Minister of Energy and Petroleum, Rafael Ramirez,49 who were then both optimistic about the chances of reaching an agreement.\n\nEx-R117, cited in Decision, para. 374.\n\nEx- C190, cited in Decision, para. 399.\n\n105.\n\nAs shall be seen below, the Majority relies heavily on a reference in Minister Ramirez's statement to \"book value\" (\"we should indemnify the book value of those assets\"),50 as one of the grounds enumerated in paragraph 400, on which it bases its final findings and draws their legal consequences in paragraph 401.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n106.\n\nParagraph 401 reads (numbers between square brackets are added) :\n\n\"401 [1] The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Respondent breached its obligations to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT [2] and that the date of the valuation is the date of the Award\".51\n\nThese two findings are taken up again in items (d) and (c) of paragraph 404, the *dispositif* of the Decision, which are the object of my dissent.\n\n107.\n\nThese findings provide the answer to the question which appears as title to Part VIIB(4) of the Decision which reads :\n\n\"Did the Respondent in the Negotiations about Compensation Negotiate in Good Faith by Reference to the Standard in Article 6(c) of the BIT ?\"52\n\nDecision, Title atop, para. 361.\n\n**II - CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE REASONING AND FINDINGS OF THE MAJORITY**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A - False Presumptions and Erroneous Findings**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nIn paragraph 400 of the Decision (the one following immediately that in which it cites Minister Ramirez), the Majority sums up its conclusions, in terms of determinations and assumptions of law and fact, that serve as premises or grounds for its findings on the process of negotiations during the second or \"final period\" (and by implication on that process as a whole).\n\n109.\n\nParagraph 400 reads : (the square brackets are superimposed for clarity)\n\n\"400. [1] The Tribunal does not have before it any evidence at all of the proposals made by Venezuela in this final period. [2] It observes that whatever confidentiality agreement there was has not prevented the submission to it by the Respondent of the ConocoPhillips proposals of June and August 2007. [3] There is no evidence that Venezuela moved from its insistence on book value, a standard confirmed by its Minister's statement in early 2008 at a point when the arbitration had begun. [4] Nor is there any evidence that in this period, the Venezuelan representatives brought the compensation formulas in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements into the negotiations. [5] Finally, at this stage too there was no proposal for compensation in respect of ConocoPhillips' assets in the Corocoro Project as Dr.Mommer appeared to confirm in cross-examination; he was not re-examined on the course of the negotiations\".\n\n110.\n\nMost of these findings and assumptions of law and fact either cover serious errors or are unwarranted, unproven or even proven wrong by other elements in the file, as amply shown in what follows.\n\n111.\n\nFor the clarity of exposition, it is useful to recapitulate these findings and assumptions of law and fact, together with those relating to the first period of negotiations53 - which constitute the chain of reasoning of the Majority - in their logical sequence; before scrutinizing them in the same order.\n\n1. The initial presumption, in the Majority's title-question, of an obligation on charge of the Respondent, beyond providing for fair compensation, to negotiate with the Claimants in good faith by reference to the standard of market value set out in the BIT, as interpreted by the Claimants.\n\n2. The implied finding that the Respondent's initial offer of compensation is illusory, amounting to a refusal to pay compensation.\n\n3. The finding that by the end of the first period of negotiations, Venezuela was not negotiating in good faith by reference of the standard of the Treaty, as\n\na) it did not answer in writing the queries of the Claimants in their letters of 12 April 2007 about the standard of compensation\n\nb) it did not refute (hence admitted, according to the Majority) statements the letters attributed to its representatives during the negotiations\n\ni - that compensation will not be on the basis of market value\n\nii - but of book value\n\n4. The finding that during the second period of negotiations, the Respondent did not budge from its initial position, on the basis of\n\na) continued insistence on book-value\n\nb) no evidence of new proposals\n\nc) the assumption that had there been any new proposals, the Respondent would not have hesitated to submit them, in spite of \"whatever Confidentiality Agreement\"\n\nd) no evidence that the compensation clauses of the Association Agreements were invoked by the Respondent during the negotiations\n\ne) no offer of compensation for the Conocoro project.\n\nSee Decision, para. 394; and this Opinion, para. 86 above.\n\n**1) *The Initial Presumption in the Title-Question of an obligation on* *charge of the Respondent, beyond providing for fair compensation, to negotiate with the Claimants in Good Faith by reference to the Standard set out in the BIT, as interpreted by the Claimants***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) - The title-question of the Majority is wrongly put**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe title-question (para. 107 above) to which the preceding chain of reasoning purports to provide an answer, posits a four-pronged legal presumption of\n\na) a legal obligation on charge of the nationalizing State, here the Respondent, to negotiate in good faith with the Claimants the compensation,\n\nb) by reference to the standard set by the BIT,\n\nc) as interpreted by the Claimants;\n\nd) it being a condition of the legality or lawfulness of the nationalization.\n\n113.\n\nThis question is wrongly put, because the above presumption is false in all its components, having no basis either in the BIT or in general international law.\n\n114.\n\nTo start with the first prong of the presumption a), neither general international law nor the BIT requires negotiations, not to mention negotiations with such qualifications. The conditions of the legality or lawfulness of the act of nationalization itself, in general international law, reiterated in Article 6/a and 6/b, are\n\ni - that it be for a public purpose\n\nii - that it be non-discriminatory.54\n\nThe non-respect of either of these conditions renders the act of nationalization illegal *ab initio*.\n\nArticle 6(b) of the BIT adds a second prohibition, which goes without saying as a species of *lex* *specialis:*  \n*\"* b) the measures are not discriminatory or *contrary to any undertaking which the Contracting Party taking such measures may have given\"* (emphasis added). This provision is modeled after the circumstances of the *Chorzow Factory* case, which is discussed at some length below, para. 255ff of this Opinion.\n\n115.\n\nThe obligation prescribed in Article 6(c) of the BIT that the measures of nationalization be \"taken against just compensation\" reflects the rule of general international law for the generality of cases55 and has to be interpreted in the light of this rule. There is no mention in this text of an obligation to negotiate compensation. Nor can such an obligation be subsumed under, or derived by necessary implication from the rule of general international law underlying it.\n\nThis general rule is subject to qualification, the elaboration of which is not necessary here. See for example, the recent Resolution of the Institute of International Law, adopted on 13 September 2013 during its 76th Tokyo session, entitled \"*Legal Aspects of Recourse to Arbitration by an Investor Against the Authorities of the Host State under Inter-State Treaties*\", Art- 14, para 2 : \"... As to the interpretation and application of the notion of \u2018adequate' compensation, an appropriate balance must be assured between the interests of the investor and the public purpose of the State\"; without forgetting the famous statement of Sir Hersch Lauterpacht in the 8th edition of Oppenheim's *International Law* (1st volume, Peace, edited by H. Lauterparcht, London Longmans, 1955) p. 352 : \"The second modification [of \"the rule... clearly established that a State is bound to respect the property of aliens\"] must be recognized in cases in which fundamental changes in the political system and economic structure of the State or far-reaching social reforms entail interference, on a large scale, with private property. In such cases neither the principle of absolute respect for alien private property nor rigid equality with the dispossessed nationals offer a satisfactory solution of the difficulty. It is probable that, consistently with legal principle, such solution must be sought in the granting of partial compensation\".\n\n116.\n\nAll the obligation to pay just compensation requires is that, at or around the time of nationalization, the State provides for such a payment, for example by establishing a procedure for its determination or by offering a given sum.\n\n117.\n\nIf this is done, the State would have discharged its obligation, even when the offer of the State is contested, thus triggering a dispute over the applicable law (i.e. the legal standard applicable *in casu*), or the quantum of the compensation. Obviously, in such a case, negotiations are one of, and even the first to come to mind among the available means of settlement of such disputes. But it is one of several possible means (that comprise *inter alia* judicial and arbitral procedures), and there is no specific obligation on the State, or for that matter on the other Party, to use it rather than another, in the absence of a *lex specialis* to that effect. That much for the first prong (a) of the Majority presumption.\n\n118.\n\nIn any case (and here I am addressing the fourth prong (d) of the Majority's presumption), neither the process of such negotiations, if they take place, nor their failure or success has anything to do with the legality or lawfulness of the nationalization. This is because, according to international jurisprudence and doctrine, the obligation to pay compensation is not a condition of the legality of the act of nationalization, but a secondary obligation flowing from that act56. In other words, it is situated downstream rather than upstream the act of nationalization.\n\nSee M.Mohebi, *The International Law Character of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal,* Kluwer Law International, Boston, 1999, p. 289 : \"The non-payment of compensation does not, as such, make a taking *ipso facto* wrongful, rather it is a violation by the expropriating state of an independent duty which applies evenly to both unlawful and lawful taking\". Also, A. Mouri, *The International Law of Expropriation as Reflected in the Work of the Iran-U.S Claims Tribunal,* Martinus Nijhoff, 1994, pp. 333334, \"In actuality, no award of the Tribunal considered any expropriation or other measures affecting property rights to be unlawful for want of prompt payment, notwithstanding the Tribunal\u2019s knowledge of the fact that no compensation was affected until the time of the awards and that in most instances no provision was even made in that respect\".\n\n119.\n\nThere is, however, one particular case in which the failure to discharge the obligation to compensate can affect the legality or lawfulness of the nationalization. It is when the State refuses from the outset to pay any compensation, or, in the words of Oppenheim\u2019s classic *International Law*, \"if compensation offered is clearly illusory\",57*i.e*. when it is so negligible as to amount to a refusal to pay compensation. In such a case, nationalization or expropriation become mere confiscation of foreign property, which is illegal under international law.58\n\nOppenheim\u2019s *International Law*, vol.I Peace, 9th edition by Sir Robert Jennings and Sir Arthur Watts, London, Longsman, 1992, p. 921, footnote 35.\n\nThere are admitted exceptions to this rule, for example when confiscation is applied as a penal sanction to a generally recognized crime, and in certain circumstances under the law of war; not to mention the controversy over the legality of confiscation of foreign property as an act of reprisal.\n\n120.\n\nCan it be surmised *prima facie* that the 2.3 billion US dollars offered by the Respondent as compensation for the Petrozuata and Hamaca projects are so negligible a sum as to amount to a refusal to pay compensation, rendering the nationalization of these two projects illegal ? This is the contention of the Claimants that shall be discussed at some length below (para. 142ff).\n\n121.\n\nIt would have been legally more judicious and much easier for all concerned had the Tribunal followed the objective road by putting the question in terms similar to the ones above (i.e. was the offer illusory ?). But the Majority chose another subjective road in the way it drafted the question (*i.e.* did Venezuela negotiate in good faith ?); making the answer turn on the proof of bad faith, a well neigh impossible task in the absence of direct evidence. This led the Majority to overload the question artificially with conditions and qualifications, leading - but only by presumption, conjecture and indirect inference - to the negative answer it seeks to reach, as shown below.\n\n122.\n\nHowever, in the final analysis, the proper legal solution of the issue lies in the answer to the former (objective) question, regardless of the answer to the latter (subjective one). And in both cases, the answer provided by the Majority (implicitly to the first; explicitly for the second, in para. 401 of the Decision) is wrong in my opinion.\n\n**b) The question is also a leading one**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nApart from being wrongly put, by positing on charge of the Respondent an obligation that does not exist either in the BIT or in international law, the title-question of the Majority is a \"leading one\", because it subsumes or at least insinuates the negative answer it seeks to reach; and this through the last clause of the question \" reference to the standard in Article 6/c of the BIT\", when the main contention between the parties is precisely on the determination of the proper standard of compensation as applicable law *in casu* and/or on the interpretation of this standard.\n\n124.\n\nEven if one accepts *arguendo* (that which I obviously do not) the legal existence of such an obligation to negotiate in good faith the compensation, the Majority, by adding the last qualifier clause, assumes (on top of the existence of the obligation) that the only legally possible \"applicable law\" to compensation is the BIT standard, and that merely contesting it or invoking, on credible legal grounds, another applicable law is a sufficient proof of bad faith.\n\n125.\n\nThis latter presumption, which is not expressly articulated, but posited in the question by necessary implication, is a stark aberration. For, if the BIT is *lex specialis* in relation to general international law, there is nothing in law or legal logic that excludes the possible existence of an even narrower *lex specialis* that prevails over the BIT.\n\n126.\n\nMoreover, the drastic legal consequences that the Majority draws on the basis of this false presumption are even a worse legal aberration. To illustrate this, one can give a hypothetical example based on the factual matrix of the present case; supposing that during the negotiations, and contrary to the Claimants, the Respondent maintains, on the basis of reasonable grounds, that the BIT is not the proper \"applicable law\" that governs the standard of compensation,59*e.g*. that as the protected investment is a contractual right, established by a contract that provides for the compensation of the alleged violation, this contract is the proper applicable law.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt I should clarify that this is not exactly my understanding of the position of the Respondent *in casu*, as shall be explained later.\n\n127.\n\nA tribunal is of course free, after due consideration, to endorse or reject such a legal thesis or position. But even if the tribunal rejects it, finding that the standard of the BIT is applicable *in casu*, does this allow that Tribunal, by whatever legal logic, also to find that the mere fact of the Respondent maintaining this position is proof, not to say sufficient proof, of its bad faith during the negotiations?\n\n128.\n\nIn other words, can a tribunal consider that the mere adoption by a party, during prior negotiations, of a position that appears *prima facie* to be legally tenable, with reasonable support in legal opinion, in opposition to the legal position of the other party which it finally endorses, a sufficient proof of bad faith in negotiations ?\n\n129.\n\nIt suffices to articulate such a finding with its logical underpinnings, or rather the total absence thereof, to show its utter legal absurdity; the more so, returning to our case, that the conclusion the Majority reaches on the basis of this presumption, *i.e* that the Respondent has acted in bad faith, is a most serious international delict, to which the Tribunal attributes drastic legal consequences.\n\n130.\n\nTo find that a party that rejects the other party's legal position, or propose an alternative one on the basis of credible legal grounds, that are not spurious, *i.e*. *prima facie* legally untenable; to find that the mere holding of such a position in negotiation or litigation, if it is ultimately rejected by the tribunal, is an act of bad faith of that party and a breach by itself of an independent obligation (whose source is not identified in either the BIT or general international law), apart from being a total legal aberration, would have general catastrophic implications.\n\n131.\n\nIt would mean that no party would dare or at least be at ease defending its legal position for fear of being found in bad faith if it turns out that the tribunal does not endorse it, and being sanctioned independently for merely holding this position, apart from loosing on the merits in the original case.\n\n132.\n\nMoreover, this would open the door to legal extortion. For, unless one concedes to the other party's legal position, even if he considers it wrong, he runs the risk of double jeopardy in case a tribunal upholds the position of his opponent. He would not only lose on the merits, but would be found also at fault simply for upholding, in negotiations or adjudication, what he considered the proper legal position; a fault which could have as a consequence to aggravate even his loss on the merits, as *in casu*.\n\n133.\n\nThe absurdity of this position needs no further demonstration; and this takes care of the second prong of the false legal presumption of the Majority Decision described in para. 112 above.\n\n134.\n\nThe question is also leading because it posits not only that there is only one possible legal standard of compensation, the BIT standard, but also that there is only one possible interpretation of this standard, the Claimants interpretation. This is the third prong (c) of the Majority's false legal presumption (above, paragraph 112). It is not explicitly stated in the question, but underlies the reasoning of the Majority in answering it.\n\n135.\n\nThe unveiling of this presumption needs explanation. : The Respondent's position, as I understand it, and contrary to the hypothetical example I gave above, is not that the compensation clauses in the Association Agreements constitute the proper compensation standard (*i.e*. that the Association Agreements themselves are the proper applicable law) *in casu*. Venezuela's position is rather that these clauses have to be taken into account in assessing the market value, as one of the factors that partake in the determination of that value. In other words, according to the interpretation of the Respondent, the BIT standard of market value, necessarily integrates (presumably for the evident legal and economic reasons given above, para. 25ff.) the compensation clauses of the Association Agreements, as constitutive components or parameters of this market value.\n\n136.\n\nBoth the Claimants and the Tribunal do not make the distinction between considering the compensation clauses as an alternative legal standard to \"market value\", and their consideration as part or parameter of the same legal standard of \"market value\".\n\n137.\n\nThe Claimants chose at the beginning totally to ignore the issue of the compensation clauses in their first written pleadings. But in view of the heavy emphasis by the Respondent from the outset on these clauses, the Claimants summarily dismissed them in their last written pleading, the Reply60, on the basis of the controversial distinction between contract claims and treaty claims. They contend that these compensation clauses have nothing to do with their treaty claim against Venezuela before this Tribunal, as they are part of contracts (the Association Agreements) to which Venezuela is not a party.\n\nReply, 9 Nov. 2009, para 380, 493.\n\n138.\n\nThe Majority chose another facile exit route to eliminate these conditions from its field of vision. It found that it had no evidence that this issue was raised during the negotiations; an erroneous finding, in my submission, as shown below (para. 201ff).\n\n139.\n\nHowever, the point to be noted here is different, namely that, regardless of the correct or erroneous character of the above finding, it reveals the position of the Majority on another important aspect of the issue. It is that the Majority adopts axiomatically, *i.e.* as a given, hence as a presumption, without any further proof than the assertion of the Claimants, their interpretation (or characterization) of the compensation clauses as not being intrinsic determinants of the market value of the protected investment.\n\n140.\n\nThis presumption (being the third prong of the legal presumption carried by the title-question (see above, para.112), is patently false, for the reasons expounded above (para. 134ff). But it is an essential stepping stone in the logical scheme of the Majority to attain the result it seeks to reach. For without presuming, implicitly, that the compensation clauses are not an intrinsic determinant of the market value of the protected investment, it would have been impossible for the Majority to skip or bypass a logically essential first step. This prior missed step is examining whether the initial offer of Venezuela was *prima facie* \"illusory\", *i.e* grossly inadequate, or not; hence whether it could serve as a reasonable basis of discussion or negotiations (*i.e* taking the objective route), rather than jumping directly into the subjective quagmire of fathoming intentions, by inquiring into whether Venezuela was negotiating in good faith or not.\n\n141.\n\nIndeed this presumption that the compensation clauses are not part of the equation determining the market value of the protected investment, allowed the Majority to exclude them at the outset from being taken into consideration.61 By so doing, the Majority was also able to make another implied determination, again on the basis of the mere assertion of the Claimants, hence by way of presumption, (to be dealt with in the next section), namely, that the initial compensation offer of Venezuela (barring the effect of the compensation clauses) was illusory. Together, these two implied presumptions served as a jumping rod for the Majority's leap of faith (faith in the Claimants assertions, without any further verification), into the long and wrong subjective detour leading to its (submittedly erroneous) finding that Venezuela from the outset, *i.e*. at least from its initial offer, was not negotiating in good faith.\n\nThe Majority said that it will examine later on, in the quantum phase of the proceedings, whether these clauses have any relevance in the calculation of this quantum. Decision, para. 402. But this position is logically incongruous, for the issue of the relevance of the compensation clauses is prior in logic to, and determinative of whether the Respondent's initial offer was credible or not and consequently whether it was negotiating in good faith or not.\n\n**2) *The implicit finding that the initial offer of Compensation by the Respondent was \"illusory\" or \"grossly inadequate\", amounting*  *to* a *refusal to pay compensation***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nAccording to the Majority, the first period of the negotiations was closed by the round of exchange consisting of the very first offer of compensation by Venezuela for the total cession (or nationalization) of ConocoPhillips shares in the Petrozuata and Hamaca projects, made in a meeting on the 29th of March 2007, and its rejection by the Claimants' three identical letters of 12 April 2007.\n\n143.\n\nThe Majority found that :\n\n\"Venezuela at that time, [i.e. at the close of that first period of negotiations] was not negotiating in good faith by reference to the standard of \u2018market value' set out in the BIT\".62\n\nDecision, para 394.\n\n144.\n\nThis finding or determination subsumes by necessary implication another one, namely that Venezuela's initial offer was so negligible or trivial, measured against the Treaty standard as to be \"illusory\" or \"confiscatory\",63 amounting to a refusal to pay compensation. In any case, that is the understanding of the Claimants, which comes out clearly from the speech of Claimants Counsel in the closing session of the oral hearings :\n\n\"Now, if Venezuela had actually made a good faith offer of compensation and then provided a reasonable opportunity for the Parties to resolve their dispute, we accept that that would have been a lawful expropriation, *sub modo*, subject to the actual payment of compensation and interest. But that's not what happened\".64\n\nClaimant's Counsel, Transcript, p. 3854.\n\nTranscript, p. 3852. cited also by the Majority in paragraph 397 of the Decision.\n\n145.\n\nWhat would be then, according to the Claimants, a \"good faith\" or \"reasonable offer\"? Here we do not have one, but a large variety, of answers.\n\n146.\n\ni -Thus, in their Memorial, the Claimants contend that Venezuela's offer \"represented no more than five percent of the real value of the Claimants' investments\".65 This means that, according to the Claimants, the fair market value of their investment amounts to 46 billion US dollars. And indeed, if the offer proved to represent no more than 5% of the value of the nationalized assets, it would be \"wholly inadequate\", \"illusory\", hence \"confiscatory\".\n\nClaimants Memorial, para. 309, cited in the Decision, para 390; and in this Opinion, para 75 above.\n\n147.\n\nii - Surprisingly, in the same Memorial, the Claimants demand an open-ended \"award of damages\" of \"US$ 30,305,400,400\".66 However, this claim of 30 billion US dollars includes other items such as the US credit tax deduction and compensation for changes in tax and royalty rates. The \"fair market value of the interests of the Claimants in the Projects, as of August 31, 2008\" is estimated at \"17,576.8\" billion US dollars (including Corocoro).\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 473.\n\n148.\n\niii - Yet, in the Closing session of the oral pleadings, Counsel to the Claimants declared that \"an offer of Fair Market Value would have been of the order of seven to ten times the amount of the offer actually made\".67 This means that it should fall within the range of 16.1 to 23 billion US dollars.\n\nTranscript. p. 3514.\n\n149.\n\niv -Then we have the counter-offer made by the Claimants themselves, in their letter of 17 August 2007 discussed above (para.98ff), in which the Claimants modified their earlier offer of exchange of assets, amounting, if translated into monetary terms, to accepting the equivalent of 6.7 billion US dollars in exchange of their interests in the three projects and the settlement of all their other claims.\n\n150.\n\nWhilst keeping in mind the usual \"without prejudice\" reservation of the letter and its pointing up the transactional character of its modified offer (by adding one and a half billion dollars in cash to the mere barter of assets proposed in the earlier letter of 15 June 2007), this offer by the Claimants remains nonetheless indicative of what they were willing still to accept as \"fair compensation\". For, it is normal in such negotiations to start round the top of the range of one's estimates of the value of his assets. But more indicative of his real evaluation, is where he sets the lower confines of that range.\n\n151.\n\nStill, one has to compare comparables, which requires deducting from the 6.7 billions the value of Corocoro, as well the first and sizeable separate claim of compensation for what Counsel for the Claimants calls the \"expropriation by stages\"68(*i.e*. creeping expropriation) through changes in royalty rates and tax legislation.69\n\nTranscript, p. 3519.\n\nThis claim is rejected unanimously by the Tribunal in para. 404(b) of the Decision.\n\n152.\n\nThis leaves us at best with roughly the double of the 2.3 billions offered by Venezuela, which is a reasonable range of difference between negotiating parties in such situations, very far from the ratio of 1 to 7 or 1 to 10 proposed by Counsel to the Claimants, and already discussed above (para. 148ff).\n\n153.\n\nSuch extremely dispersed estimates - ranging from 46 to significantly less than 6.7 billion US dollars - should have incited the Majority to exercise a modicum of judicial due diligence, by conducting its own *prima facie* verification of the veracity of such estimates, before taking position on the reasonableness of the Respondent's initial offer. This could have been easily done by looking in the file for indices or estimates prepared for internal use or purposes other than being used as part of the pleadings *in casu*, and thus more credit worthy.\n\n154.\n\nHad the Majority cared to exercise this modicum of judicial due diligence, it would have found, with some effort it is true, two such documents which would have settled the matter, at least on a *prima facie* basis, which is all that is needed at this stage.\n\n155.\n\nBoth these documents are part of the exhibits submitted by the Claimants and their accountants (LECG). And both take the form of calculation tables with widespread time series, apparently constructed following the discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology favoured by the Claimants.\n\n156.\n\nThe first table concerns the Petrozuata Project. It is part of a document entitled \"ConocoPhillips RCAT Group, *Building Production Capacity Reserves/Loss of Reserve Area COP\",* dated 14 October 2006.70 The relevant table is on a page entitled \"Project Summary\". It computes the actual value of ConocoPhillips' part in the Petrozuata project (apparently by DCF for the period 2007-2036) under four hypotheses :\n\n*a - With the reserve area*\n\ni - on the basis of 120 b/d (barrel/day) 1,121,706 million US$\n\nii - on the basis of 146 b/d 1,251,219 million US$\n\n*b - Without the reserve area*\n\ni - on the basis of 120 b/d 925,455 million US$\n\nii - on the basis of 146 b/d 945,568 million US$\n\nClaimants' Rebuttal Exhibits, C-474.\n\n157.\n\nIn other words, this internal document emanating from the Claimants, and dating from October 2006, just before the reelection of President Chavez, *i.e*. before the issue of compulsory migration appears, evaluates the interests of ConocoPhillips in the Petrozuata project to range from 1.25.219 (under best conditions) to 925,445 million US dollars. A range within which the offer of the Respondent of 1.1 billion US dollars falls neatly, on its upper reaches.\n\n158.\n\nThe second table concerns the Hamaca Project. It is part of a document entitled \"Petrolara Amareven Model\"71. The relevant table appears on page 551. It bears the following legend : \"2006 Business Plan NP (2007-2037) at Jan.1-07\", and at bottom of the page \"Petrolara Amareven (Hamaca) Model-Calculation Sheet - p. 551 of 566\". Apart from the time series, apparently for DCF purposes, the two relevant entries are\n\n\"2006 BP NPV before debt $3,011.64 2006 BP NPV $2,364.00\"\n\nLECG, *Preliminary valuation Report of Claimants' Investments in Venezuela*, LECG Exhibit No. 129, p. 551 of 566.\n\n159.\n\nThis being the total value of the Project, the 40% share of ConocoPhillips amounts to :\n\n\"2006 Business Plan before debt $1,204,656 2006 Business Plan deducting debt 945.6\"\n\n160.\n\nObviously, it is the net value (after deducting debt) that counts. And here again, 945.6 Million dollars is much less that the 1.2 billion US dollars that the Respondent offered, equivalent in fact to the value of ConocoPhillips' share in the project before deducting debt.\n\n161.\n\nThese two documents of the Claimants should have put the controversy over the \"good faith\" or \"reasonable\" character of the Respondent's initial offer to rest, had the Majority exercised a modicum of judicial due diligence by looking for them or their likes and looking into them. For, it is not enough that a party rejecting an offer of compensation contends that it is \"manifestly and grossly inadequate\"72, for it to be so considered by the Tribunal.\n\nClaimants' Counsel, Transcript p. 3515.\n\n162.\n\nAll that was needed *in casu* was a preliminary search by the Tribunal to verify the assertions of the Claimants against other possible pieces of evidence in the file, in order to reach an independent *prima facie* decision, on the reasonableness of the offer; which is all that is required at this stage, leaving the detailed valuation to the quantum stage.\n\n163.\n\nBut the Majority chose otherwise. It opted for the facile escape route of looking not at the thing itself (the actual amounts estimated and offered), but at its shadow (the label put on it and other nominal quibbles on what was said or not said about it). By so doing, the Majority took the wrong turn substituting for the logically prior, objective and straight forward question \"was the initial offer of compensation reasonable\" -whose answer could have settled the issue from the outset - the subjective question \"was the Respondent negotiating compensation in good faith?\n\n164.\n\nStill, whilst choosing to evade the former question, by shifting to the latter one, the Majority did answer the former question implicitly and in the negative. For absent a negative answer to the former objective question, the latter subjective one would be without object. This negative answer, being inferred by necessary implication, rather than expressly articulated in the Decision, is not supported therein by any justification or explanation, whilst serious legal consequences are drawn on its basis. But, above all, as an implied finding that the initial offer of compensation by the Respondent was \"illusory\" or \"grossly inadequate\" it is a wrong and erroneous determination of fact, for the reasons expounded above.\n\n**3) *The Finding that by the end of the first period of negotiations*, *Venezuela was not negotiating in Good Faith by reference to the Standard of the Treaty***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nConcerning the first negotiations period, that it considers closed with the three identical letters of the Claimants dated 12 April 2007, the Majority \"concludes\" in paragraph 394 of the Decision \"that Venezuela at that time was not negotiating in good faith by reference to the \u2018market value' set out in the BIT\".\n\n166.\n\nThe Majority bases this finding on two grounds :\n\na - that the Venezuelan authorities did not respond in writing \"to the points made about those negotiations in those letters\";73 b - that they \"did not challenge the account the letters gave of the course of the meetings\"74 (hence admitted it, as the language of the Majority seems to infer); in particular\n\ni - they did not reject the position attributed to them that any compensation would not be based on fair market value,75\n\nii - proposing instead \"book value\".\n\nDecision para. 394.\n\n*Ibid.* para. 393.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n167.\n\nEven if one assumes *arguendo* that the Majority's subjective approach is right and consequently that the title-question (with its four pronged legal presumption) is properly put - that which I strongly reject for the reasons given in the preceding two sections - the answer given to that question by the Majority in the form of the above finding of fact, the same as the grounds on which it is built, are, as determinations of fact, wrong, for the following reasons :\n\n168.\n\na) Concerning the first ground of the Majority's finding, *i.e.* the absence of a Venezuelan response to the three letters of 12 April 2007 and their queries about the legal standard of compensation and the statements attributed to the Venezuelan authorities in the course of negotiations, it is true as already mentioned, in paragraph 79 above, that no direct written reply to these letters can be found among the documents submitted to the Tribunal by 3 September 2013, the date the Decision was issued76. The Majority, however, gives excessive weight to written documents, excluding oral answers and explanations that must have been given or exchanged during the various meetings of negotiations.\n\nAs was indicated in footnote 32 above, there was in fact a written response in a letter by Dr. Mommer to Mr. Lyons, dated 13 April 2007 (the day following that of the Claimants' letters of 12 April 2007). But that letter was submitted to the Tribunal after the Decision of 3 September 2013 was issued, and could not have been taken into consideration. In that letter, Dr. Mommer, commenting on the Claimants' letters of the day before writes : \"As in previous communications from ConocoPhillips, these letters are disappointing for both their tone and their content, leading to the unfortunate conclusion that ConocoPhillips is more interested in trying to build a procedural case than in concluding in a satisfactory way the process of migration... We do not deem it necessary or useful to discuss herein the legal issues and the facts alleged in your letters...\" (reference in footnote 32 above).\n\n169.\n\nAnyway, a negotiating party would normally be reluctant to answer such questions in writing, during the sensitive stages of the negotiations, for fear of loosing all flexibility and foreclosing beforehand the outcome of the negotiations, or in case of their failure, of his answers being used somehow against him; i.e. in both cases, for fear of falling into a trap.\n\n170.\n\nThus, the absence of a written answer during an on-going negotiation, cannot be interpreted or taken for an absence of all or any answer. But even in the absence of answer, this cannot be considered in itself, under any system of evidence, as proof of bad faith.\n\n171.\n\nb) The second ground on which the Majority bases its finding is that the Venezuelan authorities did not challenge the account the letters gave of the course of negotiations, and particularly that they did not reject the statements attributed to them in this account, the Majority inferring there from an admission by the Venezuelan authorities of the veracity of this account.\n\n172.\n\nIn the first place, not answering a letter or rejecting the allegations it proffers concerning the recipient, is not an internationally wrongful act, except where a specific obligation (*i.e*. *lex specialis*) requires it. Nor can it be considered by itself, in any procedural system I know of, and in any case not in international procedural law, as an admission of the veracity of the contentions included in such letters. For \"silence is silent\", it does not speak either way; unless context imparts it with significance (\"*le silence circonstanci\u00e9*\"). But here, on the contrary, the context, as described in paragraph 169 above, justifies silence even further.\n\n173.\n\nBe that as it may, neither of the statements or positions attributed by the letters to the Venezuelan authorities bears out the finding of bad faith in negotiations by reference to market value.\n\ni - Invoking \"book value\" is not in itself a rejection of \"market value\". Book value is simply an accounting or actuarial method of computing sums, here compensation, according to whatever legal standard, including the \"market value\" standard. It is discussed at greater length in the next section;\n\nii - The statement allegedly made by Dr. Mommer that \"any compensation would not be based on fair market value\" as well as the misrepresentation by the Majority of Dr. Mommer's strong refutation of it are discussed in paragraphs 79 to 84 above. They are discussed further later on, together with other misinterpretations by the Majority of Dr. Mommer's testimonies and conduct (below, paras. 277-279).\n\n**4) *The Finding that during the second and final period of negotiations, the Respondent did not budge from its initial position, and was thus not negotiating in Good Faith***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThis finding is based on five grounds, enumerated in paragraph 400 of the Decision. They are :\n\na) continued insistence of the Respondent on book value\n\nb) no evidence of new proposals on his part\n\nc) the assumption that had there been any new proposals, the Respondent would not have hesitated to submit them, in spite of \"whatever Confidentiality Agreement\"\n\nd) no evidence that the compensation clauses of the Association Agreements were invoked by the Respondent during the negotiations\n\ne) no offer of compensation for the Conocoro project was made throughout the negotiations.\n\n175.\n\nThe last two grounds pertain to both periods of negotiation. And all of them, with the exception of the last one, are either false presumptions or erroneous determinations of fact, as shown in what follows.\n\n**a) Continued insistence of the Respondent on \"Book Value\"**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\n- Relying on the Claimants narrative of the negotiations as presented in Mr. Lyons' letters of 12 April 2007;77 and particularly on the mention of \"book value\" by Minister Rafael Ramirez in his statement in the National Assembly on 14 February 200878, the Majority finds that :\n\n\"There is no evidence that Venezuela moved from its insistence on book value, *a standard* confirmed by its Minister's statement in early 208 at a point when the arbitration had begun\".79\n\nEX-C-241 : \"any valuation based upon book value would neither adequately compensate ConocoPhillips for.Venezuela's unilateral changes in commercial terms (royalty and taxes) over the past several years, nor for the additional changes resulting from the Nationalization Decree\".\n\nEx-C-190, cited in Decision, para. 399.\n\nDecision, para.400 (emphasis added).\n\n177.\n\nThis finding is used in order to reach the conclusion that Venezuela was not negotiating in good faith on the basis of the standard of market value prescribed in Article 6c of the BIT. The Majority thus considers book value as an equivalent, but antagonistic, legal standard to that of \"market value\"; wherein lies its fundamental conceptual error.\n\n178.\n\nIndeed, far from being a standard, not to mention a legal standard such as \"market value\", \"book value\" is a mere technical accounting method of valuation, which can be used to compute or assess \"current\" or \"fair market value\", as well as any other value determined according to whatever legal standard.\n\n179.\n\nThis is non-controversial common knowledge. And it is as such, *i.e*. as an accounting technique or method, not as a legal standard, that \"net book value\" is treated for example in the ILC commentary on Article 36 (entitled \"Compensation\") of its \"Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts\".80\n\n*Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001,* vol.II, part 2, Commentary on Article 36, para. 24.\n\n180.\n\nSignificantly, the very accounting experts of the Claimants, LECG, treat \"book value\" as one of the \"valuation methodologies\", stating that they \"considered\" but \"rejected the use of the Book Value and Adjusted Book Value approaches to valuation\",81 in favour of \"the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methodology\". This clearly means that they considered it as a mere technical accounting method, among others, of computing the compensation, once determined, and not a legal standard following which this compensation is to be determined.\n\nLECG \"Preliminary Valuation Report of Claimants Investments in Venezuela\", September 12 2008, para. 76.\n\n181.\n\nThus, proposing to use \"book value\" as an accounting method cannot be considered in itself as a rejection of the legal standard of \"current market value\". The difference, if there is one as *in casu*, is not over the legal standard of \"current market value\", but over the accounting methodology of its computation.\n\n182.\n\nNor is the proposal to use the \"book value\" method of valuation an absurdity, as shown by the declaration of the expert accountants of the Claimants, LECG, cited above, that they have considered the use of this methodology but preferred that of DCF over it; which means that they deemed it sufficiently credible to be worthy of consideration, even if they ended up opting for DCF.\n\n183.\n\nIndeed the comparison of the two methodologies - the one asset-based; the other with a future income capitalization approach - reveal that each of them has its merits and shortcomings that contrast with those of the other, and which are magnified or shrunk according to the circumstances of the case, or rather the assumptions that accountants make about the state of the asset and the present and future conditions of the specific market.82\n\nIt also follows from the above observation in the text that depending on those conditions or the assumptions made about them, the book value method may yield, in a given case, less or more than that of the DCF.\n\n184.\n\nThus, the ILC Commentary on Article 36 notes, concerning \"book value method\" that :\n\n\"Its advantages are that the figures can be determined by reference to market costs, they are normally drawn from contemporaneous record, and they are based on data generated for some other purpose than supporting the claim.... The limitations of this method lie in its reliance on historical figures... which tend to undervalue assets, especially in periods of inflation...83.\n\n*Supra* note 80, para 24.\n\n185.\n\nIn other words, the advantage of this method is its certainty and objectivity, while its shortcomings lie in its \u2018backward looking' character (as LECG describes it84), whence its conservative slant, particularly in inflationary environments.\n\n*Supra* note 81, para. 77.\n\n186.\n\nOn the other hand, concerning the DCF method, the ILC Commentary remarks that :\n\n\"Since 1945, valuation techniques have been developed to factor in different elements of risk and probability... Although developed as a tool of assessing commercial value, it [the DCF method] can also be useful in the context of calculating value for compensation purposes. But difficulties can arise in the application of the DCF method to establish capital value in the compensation context. The method analyses *a wide range of inherently speculative elements*, some of which have a significant impact upon the outcome (*e.g*. discount rates, currency fluctuations, inflation figures, commodity prices, interest rates and other commercial risks). This has led tribunals to adopt a cautious approach to the use of the method. Hence, although income-based methods have been accepted in principle, there has been a decided preference for asset-based methods. A particular concern is the risk of double-counting which arises from the relationship between the capital value of an enterprise and its contractually based profits\".85\n\n*Supra* note 80, para. 26 (footnotes omitted).\n\n187.\n\nPut it differently, the DCF method while factoring potential futuregenerated income, in the calculation of value, is based on highly speculative elements86 and has a strong over-estimation bias. That which led a highly authoritative and objective source such as the ILC to underline the cautious approach of tribunals to the use of this method and their \"decided preference for asset-based methods\", and to highlight the risk in using it of \"double-counting\".\n\nCf. *Amoco International Finance Corp. v. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran et al.,* Partial Award No. 310-56-3, July 14, 1987, 15 Iran-US CTR 189 (1987), para. 239 : \"The element of speculation in a short-term projection is rather limited, although unexpected events can make it turn out to the be wrong. The speculative element rapidly increases with the number of years to which a projection relates. It is well known, and certainly taken into account by investors, that if it applies to a rather distant future a projection is a most purely speculative, even if its done by the most serious and experienced forecasting firms, especially if it relates to such a volatile factor as oil prices\".\n\n188.\n\nIndeed, it is worth noting that in most cases, tribunals, after examining the problem, end up using a mix of these methods87 ; and even when they profess using the DCF method, award only a fraction of what the full application of the method would have yielded.88\n\nE.g. *Rumeli Telekom AS and Telsim Mobil Telekomikasyon Hiznetleri AS v. Kazakhtan,* Award, ICSID case No. ARB /05/16, 29 July 2008, paras.8.09 - 8010 and 8013; *National Grid Public Limited Company v. Argentina,* Award, Case 1.09-cv-00248-RBW, 3 November 2008. Ad Hoc Tribunal (UNCITRAL), paras. 276 and 285.\n\nE.g. *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina*, Award, ICSID case No. ARB/01/8, 12 May 2005, paras. 421, 423, 439 - 68; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets LP.v.Argentina*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, 22 May 2007, paras. 405-406, 435.\n\n189.\n\nTurning to the statement of *Minister Rafael Ramirez* in the National Assembly in February 2008, in which he mentioned \"book value\", it is clear from the above examination of the two accounting methodologies in general, that proposing \"book value\" as a method of valuation of the nationalized interests *in casu* is neither a theoretical heresy nor a practical aberration; nor does it imply by itself the rejection of the use of any legal standard, including the fair market value standard, for the determination of the scope of these interests.\n\n190.\n\nIn any case, one should read the statement of Minister Ramirez in its context in order to understand it correctly, rather than cite it out of context and conjecture from it. And the context clearly indicates that Minister Ramirez was referring to \"book value\" by highlighting its virtues not as a legal standard but as a technical accounting method of assessing value, being \"transparent\", \"auditable\", etc.; and this in contrast to the DCF method, which he did not specifically name, but is easily identifiable through his description of it as yielding \"numbers [that] sometimes appear to be fantasies... abusive-or hope to obtain the value of that business in 25 more years of operation under certain scenarios that are beyond anything normally seen in the hydrocarbons market\".89\n\nEx-C. 190, para 23.\n\n191.\n\nIn other words, the Declaration of the Minister reveals a choice or preference for an accounting method of calculation of value, which may be right or wrong, but this does not transform it into a different legal standard, nor its preference into a refusal to pay \"just compensation\".\n\n192.\n\nMoreover, one should ponder on what Minister Ramirez said exactly : \"we should indemnify the book value of those assets\". The use of \"should\" clearly signifies a preference, not a definitive decision (which would have been the case had he said for example \"we will only use\" or indemnify book value\"); which left the matter open to further negotiations.\n\n193.\n\nAnd indeed, Minister Ramirez started that part of his speech by noting that :\n\n\"Unlike ExxonMobil, it [ConocoPhillips] has requested and has maintained communications to an extent that makes it possible to reach an amicable solution to our dispute. We are working on that, and, as the Global CEO of ConocoPhilips expressed in past statements, we are on our way to reaching an agreement\".90 And he closed that part of his speech by declaring that :\"we are working with Conoco to resolve our controversy in these matters, and are closing the gap between our numbers\".91\n\nThat which was confirmed by the concordant statement of Mr. James Muleva, the CEO of ConocoPhillips around the same time, to which Minister Ramirez referred in his speech.92\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nEx-C.196.\n\nPublic statement of Mr. James Muleva, reported by Reuters on 12 February 2008, in which he said : \"We are continuing our discussions with PdVSA and the Venezuelan authorities.I believe we are making progress. It will take time. I would like to see and hope that we can come to some sort of solution to this in 2008.the objective is to reach an amicable solution so as not to follow the [arbitration] process through for a number of years\" (Ex-R.117).\n\n194.\n\nThese two contemporaneous statements clearly show that as late as February 2008, well after the initiation of the arbitration, the situation was not frozen and the positions of the parties were hopefully still moving towards a settlement, whence the mention by Mr. Ramirez that they were \"closing the gap between [their] numbers\". But if Venezuela (the same as ConocoPhillips) was moving from its position towards that of the other parties, \"to close the gap between [their] numbers\", how can it be affirmed, as does the Majority, that \"there is no evidence that Venezuela moved from its insistence on book value\"?93\n\nDecision, para. 400.\n\n195.\n\n*To conclude on \"book value\",* the findings of the Majority incorporate or are based on three presumptions, the first two of law, the last of fact, namely :\n\ni - that \"book value\" is a *legal standard* of compensation, the same as \"market value\";\n\nii - that it is necessarily, i.e. in all cases, a lower standard, yielding a lower outcome, than \"market value\"; and\n\niii - that during the second or \"final period\" of negotiations, Venezuela had not budged from its initial position and offer (of 29 March 2007), as witnessed by its continued \"insistence on book value\", expressed by Minister Ramirez in Parliament in February 2008.\n\n196.\n\nBoth the first two presumptions (of law) are plainly wrong. The above analysis has amply shown, concerning the first assumption\n\na) that \"book value\" is not a standard, and more particularly not a legal standard like market value, but merely an accounting method of computing value, once this value is legally determined in principle according to whatever legal standard; in other words,\n\nb) that this method can be used for the computation of compensation determined according to any legal standard, including that of \"market value\".\n\n197.\n\nMoreover (concerning the second assumption), even if we compare book value not with market value (which would be mixing apples with oranges) but, as should be, with the other accounting methodology chosen by the Claimants, the DCF, the \"book value\" method, in spite of its conservative slant, can yield less or more than the DCF method applied to the same asset or project valued, depending on the specific conditions of the valued asset or project and the assumptions accountants make about the present and future conditions of the particular market involved.\n\n198.\n\nNone of the above was taken into consideration by the Majority, which based its finding on the mere use of the term, comforted in its interpretation by the confusion between the legal standard of compensation and the actuarial methods of its calculation.\n\n199.\n\nIn the final analysis, the controversy over the invocation of \"book value\" may prove barren. For what ultimately counts, beyond nominalism or the label put on the sum of compensation offered (that on which the Majority based its argument), is the actual magnitude of this sum, and whether it reasonably corresponds to a standard of compensation that is *prima facie* objectively and legally credible *in casu*, regardless of the accounting method used to calculate this magnitude.\n\n200.\n\n- Finally, the third assumption (or is it rather a determination ?) made by the Majority, by inference from Minister Ramirez' declaration of \"*preference* for\" (\"*we should*, indemnify book value\"), transformed by the Majority into \"*insistence* on book value\", in February 2008, that Venezuela did not budge during the second period of negotiations from its initial position nor made any new proposals; this assumption goes well beyond the issue of \"book value\". It is addressed in the next section.\n\n**b) - The absence of any evidence of proposals made by Venezuela during the second period of negotiations that bear specifically on compensation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nThe Majority affirms, in the first sentence of paragraph 400 of the Decision, that [1] \"The Tribunal does not have before it any evidence at all of the proposals made by Venezuela in this final period\". From this affirmation, together with what the Majority sees as Venezuela's continued \"insistence on book value\",94 the Majority infers the presumption that during the second and final period of negotiations starting in April 2007, Venezuela did not move, nor did it make any further effort or offer beyond its initial position and proposition of 29 March 2007.\n\nDecision, para. 400, see discussion above, para. 176ff.\n\n202.\n\nThis presumption is factually simply wrong; even if one goes only by what figures in the Majority's narrative of the negotiations. Two examples suffice.\n\n203.\n\n(1) The covering letter of ConocoPhillips of 17 August 2007, transmitting its modified offer of exchange of assets, starts as follows :\n\n\"ConocoPhillips appreciates the verbal compensation proposal made to Roy Lyons on Monday 13 August, 2007. After consideration of this proposal, ConocoPhillips respectfully submits the counter-proposal reflected in the attached term sheet...\".95\n\nDirect Testimony of Dr. Bernard Mommer, July 24, 2009, Annex No.5. See para.99 above.\n\n204.\n\nThe Majority cites only the first sentence in paragraph 397 of the Decision, thus recognizing that a new offer was made by Venezuela. But it hurries immediately to add : \"... that offer does not appear anywhere else in the evidence\", as a prelude to its total disregard in reaching the conclusion that Venezuela did not budge or move from its initial position, which is the same as saying that it did not make any new offers; that which flies in the face of what it had just chronicled.\n\n205.\n\n(2) Addressing the National Assembly on 14 February 2008, Minister Ramirez though advocating (\"we should\") the use of the book value accounting method, underscored, both at the beginning and the close of that part of his speech devoted to the dispute with ConocoPhillips, his optimism as to the success of the (then) ongoing negotiations; an optimism corroborated by the statement of Mr. Muleva, the CEO of ConocoPhillips, a few days earlier.96 Particularly, Minister Ramirez, concludes that part of his speech, which is cited at length b the Majority in paragraph 399 of the Decision, with the following hopeful note : \"We are working with Conoco to resolve our controversy in these matters, and are closing the gap between our members\".\n\nSee *supra*, para,193 and footnote 92 above.\n\n206.\n\nBut if the parties are working together to resolve their controversy and \"are closing the gap between [their] members\", this necessarily means that they are both moving from their initial positions, whatever these positions may have been (or may have been declared to be, in addressing certain audiences).\n\n207.\n\nThese two examples, chronicled by the Majority, clearly show that the position of Venezuela during the second period of negotiations over compensation for nationalization was not frozen at its initial station, but a moving one, making new offers, taking steps, etc., in an on-going negotiation.\n\n208.\n\nIt is true that the Tribunal did not have before it information about the contents of these offers and moves.97 But that does not allow the Majority in logic or in law to feign ignoring that they took place and presume they never existed, in order to reach the result it seeks, namely a determination of fact that Venezuela not only did not move, but also implicitly that it never intended to move, from its initial position, and was thus negotiating all along in bad faith.\n\nThe Tribunal did not have before it when the Decision was issued (3 Sept. 2013), the Wikileaks cables that the Respondent submitted to it soon after, as annexes to his letter of 8 September 2013. One of these cables describes in great detail the substantial moves of the Respondent towards the position of the Claimants. In this cable, dated 4 April 2008 and entitled \"ConocoPhillips Briefs Ambassador on Compensation Negotiations\", the US Embassy in Caracas reports to Headquarters on a meeting held on that day (4 April 2008) in which \"Greg Goff [the Chief ConocoPhillips negotiator then] and... Roy Lyons... briefed the Ambassador on the state of compensation negotiations with BRV [Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela]\". It reports *inter alia* that : \"Goff stated the BRV has accepted that fair market value is the standard for the first claim. He said the BRV has moved away from using book value as the standard for compensation and as agreed on fair market methodology with discount rates for computing the compensation for the expropriated assets. However, given the recent increase in oil prices, the fair market value of the assets have increased... CP has proposed a settlement number and the BRV appears to be open to it\". (EX-R.313, Annex 4). I analyze this cable in greater detail in my Dissenting Opinion appended to the Tribunal's \"Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration\" of 10 March 2014, paras. 25ff.\n\n209.\n\nBesides, if the immobility of Venezuela in its initial position is to be used, as the Majority clearly strives to do, as evidence of Venezuela's bad faith in negotiations, then what counts most, in proving or disproving it, is not so much the contents of any possible new moves or offers by Venezuela as the fact that they did or did not take place.\n\n210.\n\nIn sum, deducing presumptively the absence of new offers by Venezuela during the second period of negotiations from the mere lack of information about their contents, in spite of their proven existence (as chronicled by the Majority itself) is a blatant logical aberration and a gross legal error. The more so as witnesses on both sides have invoked a Confidentiality Agreement concluded between the parties during that period, to decline providing the Tribunal with information about the contents of the negotiations; whence the contrived efforts of the Majority to do away with this Confidentiality Agreement.\n\n**c) - The discarding of the Confidentiality Agreement98**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis section is largely taken from my Dissenting Opinion appended to the Tribunal's \"Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of 10 March 2014. The repetition proves necessary for the completeness and the continuous sequencing of the reasoning.\n\n211.\n\nDuring the oral hearings, both Mr. Goff (ConocoPhillips negotiator)99 and Dr. Mommer (Venezuela's negotiator)100 invoked a Confidentiality Agreement between the parties which prevented them from saying anything about the negotiations during the latter period, apart from Goff saying that they went on for a long time.101\n\nTranscript, p. 684.\n\n*Ibid.* pp. 185 -7-8\n\n*Ibid*. p. 684\n\n212.\n\nThe Majority Decision brushes aside any legal significance and effect of this Confidentiality Agreement when invoked in particular by Dr. Mommer to abstain from providing the Tribunal with any information about the course of the negotiations, necessarily including whatever offers made by Venezuela during that period; and this by adding immediately after the first sentence of paragraph 400 of the Decision : ([1] \"The Tribunal does not have before it any evidence at all of the proposals made by Venezuela in this period\"), the following :\n\n[2] \" It [the Tribunal] observes that whatever confidentiality agreement there was has not prevented the submission to it by the Respondent of the ConocoPhillips proposals of June and August 2007\".\n\n213.\n\nIn other words, the Majority is saying that, notwithstanding the Confidentiality Agreement, had Venezuela made any reasonable offers during that period which could strengthen its position *in casu*, it would not have hesitated to put them before the Tribunal, as it did by submitting to the Tribunal the Claimants' proposals of June and August 2007, in violation of that Agreement.\n\n214.\n\nThis reasoning of the Majority is revealing in more ways than one. Apart from a general attitude vis-\u00e0-vis the Respondent and particularly its principal witness, Dr. Mommer, it reveals an important *error in the establishment of facts* on the part of the Majority, by assuming that the Confidentiality Agreement was in effect in June 2007 (the date of the first counter-offer by ConocoPhillips, revised in August 2007),102 whilst it had on record before it evidence to the contrary. Indeed the question of the date of entry into force of the Confidentiality Agreement was put to Counsel for the Respondent during the oral hearings. His answer was that it did not come into force until November 2007.103 This answer was neither challenged nor contradicted by the Claimants during the Hearings and was even confirmed by them later on.\n\nSee *supra* para. 211ff.\n\nTranscript, p. 3705-6.\n\n215.\n\nThus, the Majority committed a *material error in establishing the facts.* But worse still, it drew from it by inference, a grave legal consequence: not only that the Respondent has breached its confidentiality obligation by submitting to the Tribunal the Claimants offers of June and August 2007, when that obligation had not yet come into being; but also, and *ex hypothesi*, that the Respondent would not have hesitated to do the same, *i.e.* submit to the Tribunal any proposition it would have made during the final period of negotiations, had they existed, in violation of its confidentiality obligation, which indeed covered that final period. In other words, the Majority predicated, not on the basis of positive proof, but by divination or sheer fiat, a presumption - drawn from a single misconceived instance involving an error of fact -of a constant course of conduct attributable to the Respondent, of not hesitating to violate its obligations whenever it suited its purposes.\n\n216.\n\nAnd through this extraordinary speculative reasoning by hypothesis, extrapolated from an erroneously established fact, the Majority makes another affirmative finding of fact over something it admitted knowing nothing about, namely the possible offers Venezuela made or did not make during the final period of negotiations, which was indeed covered by the Confidentiality Agreement; an Agreement that was invoked by witnesses for both parties to justify their refusal to divulge the exchanges and offers made during that period.\n\n217.\n\nThis affirmative finding of fact that the Respondent did not make any new offer, or rather that it stayed put in its initial position during that final period of negotiations, reached through the extraordinary speculative reasoning described above, is at the basis of the even more serious legal finding that Venezuela had not negotiated in good faith during that final period over compensation.\n\n218.\n\nObviously, if the factual premise on which are based these legal findings - reached by speculative chain-reaction reasoning - turns out to be erroneous, as *in casu*, the whole legal edifice built on it crumbles down like a house of cards.\n\n**d) The presumption that the Compensation Clauses of the Association Agreements were not invoked by the Respondent during the negotiations**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nParagraph 400 of the Decision [4] reads :\n\n\"Nor is there any evidence that in this period [the second period of negotiations], the Venezuelan representatives brought the Compensation formulas in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements into the negotiations\".\n\n220.\n\nThis is a finding of fact,104 on the basis of which the Majority posits a presumption\n\ni - that the Compensation Clauses did not play any role, or rather were not at all invoked during the negotiations; and in consequence,\n\nii - that the Tribunal does not have to take them into consideration in answering the title-question of whether Venezuela acted in good faith or not in the negotiations over compensation.\n\nThe Majority made the same finding in paragraph 394 concerning the first period of negotiations : \"There is no evidence at all that the compensation formulas played any part in the negotiations between the Parties\". Thus, the finding and the presumption built on it cover the whole course of negotiations.\n\n221.\n\nThis finding, as well as the presumption built on it, are both wrong, for factual, rational (or logical) and legal reasons.\n\n222.\n\nBut before going into them, it is important to grasp the full import of this finding in the reasoning of the Majority. For if evacuating the Compensation Clauses from the negotiations is a necessary step or condition - as it appears to be in paragraph 400 of the Decision - for reaching the conclusion that Venezuela was not negotiating in good faith, then had they been invoked, this conclusion could not have been reached.\n\nIn other words, their invocation would have signified (or witnessed to) the existence of a *bona fide* dispute between the Parties over either\n\ni - the legal standard of compensation, i.e. whether it is that of the Treaty or that of the Agreements; or over the interpretation of the standard of the Treaty, *i.e*. whether it integrates or not the Compensation Clauses of the Agreements; or\n\nii - over the adequacy of the compensation offered; which implies a *prima facie* estimation by the Tribunal of the reasonableness of the sums offered if the clauses were taken into consideration, hence the good faith of the party that invoked them. In other words, if the offer is *prima facie* reasonable or adequate, measured by the standard (or its interpretation) invoked by the State, even if this standard or its interpretation is contested by the other party, this State is deemed (according to the logic of the Majority) to have acted in good faith, regardless of the final decision of the Tribunal on this issue.\n\n223.\n\nThe presumption this finding is thus making about the conduct of Venezuela throughout the negotiations over compensation, extending over more than a year from 29 March 2007 until well into 2008, is that beyond making an offer of a certain sum, calculated by whatever accounting methodology, Venezuela not only rejected the Treaty legal standard, but also kept silent, or refused to give any indication about the legal standard, or Venezuela's interpretation of it, that underlies and legally justifies its offer.\n\n224.\n\nThis presumption is a tall story indeed. It sounds like a play on the theatre of the absurd or a Pinter scenario of incommunicability. For what were those high-ranking negotiators speaking about during the numerous long meetings they had over more than a year ? And why would the representatives of ConocoPhillips continue, for such a long time, trying to negotiate with a dumb partner (while expressing optimism about the outcome) ?\n\n225.\n\nBesides, the Majority's position is that it found \"no evidence at all\" in the record before it that Venezuela invoked the compensation clauses during the negotiations. This record is composed basically (if one goes by the references in the Decision, and apart from the pleadings of the Parties) of the written and oral testimonies of Dr. Mommer and Mr. Lyons, including the annexed ConocoPhillips' trigger letters and the letters of 12 April 2007. But as the Majority went to enormous trouble to do away with Dr. Mommer's testimony,105 it relied exclusively on the Claimants' narrative of the negotiations.\n\nThis was done by discrediting the Testimony, wrongly, as shown above in para. 79ff; or when that was not possible at all, by brushing it aside as being devoid of any evidentiary value, as shown below, para. 233ff\n\n226.\n\nHowever, both ConocoPhilipps' Counsel and witnesses, principally Mr. Lyons, totally avoided to mention in their narrative anything that might obstruct or deviate its thrust. For example, no one on the Claimants' side even mentioned the counter-offer of ConocoPhilipps in June and revised in August 2007,106 although it was invoked by Dr. Mommer who produced the letters of ConocoPhilipps. This is obviously because the counter-offer shed strong doubt on ConocoPhilipps' claim *in casu* of 30 billion US dollars.\n\nExcept for a very brief allusion to it in the Claimants Counsel's closing in the oral hearings, dismissing it as transactional.\n\n227.\n\nThe same with the compensation clauses which the Claimants totally ignored in the Request of Arbitration and their Memorial; but referred to them very briefly in their Reply, given the strong emphasis on them in the Counter-Memorial of the Respondent. But the fact that the compensation clauses are not mentioned in ConocoPhilipps' letters or by Mr. Lyons, because they are prejudicial to the Claimants' case, does not mean that they were not mentioned during the negotiations.\n\n228.\n\nThe compensation clauses being one of the main arguments of the Respondent throughout the present proceedings, could not have been totally absent from the negotiations that preceded these proceedings. Indeed, although the Claimants' line during the proceedings was to belittle the relevance and importance of these clauses, no one on the Claimants' side contested that they were an outstanding issue or claimed that they were not raised during the negotiations. That last proposition comes directly from the Majority's wand.\n\n229.\n\nBe that as it may, the fourth sentence of paragraph 400, as a finding of fact that there is no evidence (paragraph 394, on the first period of negotiations adds \"at all\") that the compensation clauses were invoked during the negotiations, is *factually*, simply, incorrect. The Tribunal disposed of two indices in the record contradicting the Majority's findings; one direct, the other indirect.\n\n230.\n\n1 -The indirect index is found in the oral testimony of Mr. Jeff W. Sheets, Claimants' witness, who was the treasurer of the Company during the crucial period 2005-2007. He was asked by Counsel to the Respondent \"are you aware of any discussion at that time about these agreements [the Association Agreements] and the compensation provisions of these agreements and how they might relate to anything that was happening in Venezuela?\". He answered \"I was aware that the discussions were happening within the Senior Management, but I was not involved in the detailed discussions about these\".107\n\nTranscript, p. 1547. The Majority refers to this testimony in the Decision, in footnote 394 in the descriptive part of \"The submissions of the Parties\"; but does not revert to it or take it into consideration in its \"assessment of the evidence relating to the negotiations\" (title atop para. 382 of the Decision).\n\n231.\n\nThat it be known to insiders that discussions were taking place within the Senior Management about the Agreements and their compensation provisions while the negotiations were going on, is highly significant in revealing that these compensation provisions were a live and worrying issue for the senior Management of ConocoPhilipps in the negotiations taking place at that time.\n\n232.\n\nOf course, Mr. Sheets' testimony does not give any indication about the contents of these internal discussions or on the way the issue was raised or approached in the negotiations. Still, it indicates that the issue was alive and living as one of the bones of contention in the then ongoing negotiations.\n\n233.\n\n2 - The second, direct, index or rather proof that the compensation clauses were invoked by he Respondent during the negotiations is found in Dr. Mommer's \"Direct Testimony\" of July 24, 2009. Describing in paragraph 22 of this Testimony the revised counter-offer of ConocoPhillips of 15 August 2007,108 he gives the reasons Venezuela rejected this counteroffer as follows :\n\n\"... it was... completely unrealistic because it gave no consideration to the compensation formulas that had been negotiated and agreed at the outset of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects and did not even reflect the true value of the interests at issue without considering those formulas\".\n\nSee above, para.99ff.\n\n234.\n\nGiving no consideration to compensation clauses being the first and foremost reason for Venezuela's rejection of the modified counter-offer, it goes without saying that it was the justification given to ConocoPhillips for this rejection in the course of the negotiations that went on for several months beyond that date. But the Majority chose another interpretation of Dr. Mommer's Testimony, that incites in reaction *the rational (or logical) reasons* confuting the finding and presumption of the Majority.\n\n235.\n\nCommenting on the last sentence of paragraph 22 in Dr.Mommer's Direct Testimony (reproduced in paragraph 233 above) - in which he gives the failure to take into consideration of the compensation clauses as the first and foremost reason for the rejection of ConocoPhillips' modified counter-offer - the Majority writes, in paragraph 396 of the Decision :\n\n\"Except for the final sentence, these paragraphs [21 and 22 of Dr. Mommer's Direct Testimony] do no more than purport to summarise the substance of the two proposals which appear as Appendices to Dr. Mommer's Testimony... It will be observed that his comment in the final sentence is not presented as an account of a reason given by the Venezuelan authorities in June and August 2007 to ConocoPhillips for rejecting the proposals\".\n\n236.\n\nThis statement is a rare (perhaps unique) example in the annals of judicial and arbitral decisions, of whishing away (by fiat ? or magic ?) cumbersome or embarrassing evidence. In fact, what the Majority is saying in this seemingly off-handed remark, is that Dr. Mommer's first hand testimony (he being the chief negotiator for Venezuela), that the failure to take into consideration the compensation clauses was the main reason for Venezuela's rejection of Conocohilipps' counter-offer, should not be taken to mean that this reason was ever expressed or given in the negotiations with ConocoPhilipps to explain or justify this rejection.\n\n237.\n\nThe rationale of this highly imaginative interpretation, is simply that this crucial piece of information, that the Majority describes as a \"comment\" (another mischaracterisation, not to say misrepresentation) was \"presented\", *i.e.* written as a direct statement, rather than taking the form of a scenario or a dialogue of the kind \"we told them\", \"they told us\", which is used in Mr. Lyons' three letters of 12 April 2007 and later on in his \"witness statement\".\n\n238.\n\nApart from the simple answer of difference in style, as witnessed by the terse two written testimonies of Dr. Mommer, and his short incisive answers in cross-examination, the essay of the Majority to explain away this crucial, from the horse's mouth, piece of evidence, is truly baffling. It strives to make us believe that Dr. Mommer, with this issue of the compensation clauses looming large in his mind as one of the strongest economic and legal arguments, if not the strongest one at his disposal as chief Venezuelan negotiator, kept it to himself, mulling over it in his internal forum (*dans son for int\u00e9rieur)* as the French say, but refrained from using it as trump card in negotiating with ConocoPhilipps. This attempt to interpret the compensation clauses out of the Testimony and out of the negotiations flies in the face of the obvious; like trying to play Hamlet without the Prince.\n\n239.\n\nThe last sentence of paragraph 22 in Dr. Mommer's Direct Testimony is also significant in another way. For it reveals the understanding of Venezuela of the relationship between the compensation clauses and the market value. It explains why Venezuela rejected the Claimants' modified offer in the following terms :\n\n\".. because it gave no consideration to the compensation formulas... and did not even reflect the true value of the interests at issue without considering those formulas\".\n\nIn other words, Dr. Mommer considers, as any seasoned economist like him should (for the elementary economic considerations expounded above, paras. 36-37), that the true value of the interests, *i.e.* their market value, includes the taking into consideration of the compensation clauses *i.e.* that these clauses are not an alternative standard to that of the market value, but are an integral part or component of it.\n\n240.\n\nTurning to the *legal considerations* that confute the Majority's presumption described in paragraph 220 above, and more particularly its second part, it may be useful to recall the gist of this part of the presumption; namely that since the Tribunal found that the compensation clauses were not invoked by Venezuela during the negotiations, the Tribunal does not have to take them into consideration in answering the title-question whether Venezuela negotiated compensation by reference to the Treaty Standard in good faith or not.\n\n241.\n\nHowever, in paragraph 402 of the Decision, the Majority makes the following \"without prejudice\" reservation :\n\n\"The Tribunal emphasizes that it does not at this stage make a finding in respect of the relevance, if any, of the compensation formulas included in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Associations Agreements to the determination of the quantum of the compensation payable in this case\".\n\n242.\n\nThe logical and legal contradiction between the two propositions of the presumption and the \"without prejudice\" clause is glaring. For how can the Tribunal decide on the merits, by answering, as envisaged by the presumption, the subjective question of whether Venezuela negotiated the compensation in good faith or not by reference to the Treaty standard, without deciding first, at least on a *prima facie* basis, the legally and logically prior issue that is left open by the without prejudice clause,109 and on the solution of which depends the answer of the subjective question ? But as this point has been already treated (see above para.134ff) there is no need to expatiate on it here any further.\n\nThis without prejudice clause, by expressly leaving the issue of the compensation clauses open, has also reversed the implied earlier finding or presumption by the Majority that the initial offer of the Respondent was \"grossly inadequate\" (following in that the Claimants' contention, without any further verification), which was a necessary precondition for the Majority's bifurcation into the subjective question. See above, para.142ff\n\n**e) No offer of compensation was made during the negotiations for the Corocoro Project**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nParagraph 400[5] of the Decision reads :\n\n\"Finally, at this stage too [ *i.e.* the second period of negotiations, like the first] there was no proposal for compensation in respect of ConocoPhilipps' assets in the Corocoro Project as Dr. Mommer appeared to confirm in cross-examination\".\n\n244.\n\nThis is true. But as Dr. Mommer explained in cross-examination, they were concentrating on the two big projects, Corocoro being much smaller and had not started production when it was nationalized. He also said that they were preparing an offer for Corocoro, but never came to finalize it.110 That which was confirmed by Mr. Lyons in his letter of 12 April 2007, concerning Corocoro, where he relates that in the meeting of 31 March 2007 they (ConocoPhililpps representatives) were told by their Venezuelan opposite members, \"that such an offer would be forthcoming\";111 though finally none came. In other words, the intention was there, but it did not translate into a concrete offer.\n\nTranscript, 1862-3.\n\nEX.C.241.\n\n245.\n\nTwo further remarks on this rather non-controversial point. The first is that as the Project had not started production at the time of nationalization, the computation of the compensation, whatever the legal standard according to which it is determined, can only be by an asset-based methodology. Indeed, in spite the valiant efforts of LECG to prove the contrary, there is a very large consensus among the accountants and the cases that dealt with the subject that income-based methodologies and particularly DCF, are totally unsuitable in such a case, as there is no income yet to calculate on its basis, and any modelings or calculations on their basis would be speculative to an unacceptable degree.112\n\nSee *World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment,* International Legal Materials, Vol. 31, No. 6 (November 1992), pp. 1363-1384 and 1376.

[1] The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Respondent breached its obligations to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhilipps assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT [2] and that the date of the valuation is the date of the Award\".\n\n248.\n\nRemarkable at first glance in these findings is that the Majority attributes to what it considers (in [1]) a breach of an obligation of the BIT113, the legal effect, as it sees it (in [2]) of an unlawful nationalization.114\n\nA highly contestable finding as shown above, para...\n\nDecision, para. 343 : \"...if the taking was unlawful, the date of valuation is in general the date of the award\". Again a highly criticable finding.\n\n249.\n\nEven if one assumes, *arguendo*, the correctness of both statements (which I strongly refute), there remains logically a missing link between them (in fact the major premise in the Majority's legal syllogism, of which [1] and [2] are respectively the minor premise and the conclusion); a link that the Majority forgot or did not dare to articulate. It can be expressed as follows : - that the breach of the presumed obligation (beyond providing for just compensation) to negotiate in good faith the compensation by reference to the standard of the Treaty as interpreted by the Claimants, renders the nationalization illegal. The omission is understandable because of the patent untenability of such a proposition.\n\n250.\n\n1) In the first place, the presumed obligation to negotiate compensation in good faith, by reference to the Treaty standard, as interpreted by the Claimants, has no basis in the BIT or in general international law (above, para. 112ff), hence no legal consequences or sanctions on its own. All the Treaty, as general international law require is that expropriation be against just or fair compensation.\n\n251.\n\nIf the State provides for such compensation, on or around the time of expropriation, by whatever means it chooses, for example by offering a sum or opening a procedure for its determination, it would have acquitted itself of its obligation; whether this has been done within or outside any negotiations, and regardless of how these negotiations were conducted and of their success or failure.\n\n252.\n\nIn other words, the only question that this condition requires a tribunal to answer at the preliminary stage of deciding on the legality of the expropriation, is whether the expropriating State provided for compensation, and if it did, to ascertain that what was offered was not \"illusory\" amounting to a refusal to pay compensation.\n\n253.\n\nIf the answer to these two questions is in the affirmative, the expropriation is lawful (provided it satisfies the other conditions). This remains the case regardless of any dispute that may arise between the parties over the standard or quantum of the compensation115. Such a dispute, or the negotiations that might take place to resolve it, have nothing to do with the legality of the expropriation.\n\nSee *i.a.* *Compania del Desarollo de Aanta Elen SA v. Costa Rica,* Final Award, iCSID Case No ARB/96/1, 17 February 2000, paras. 68-74.\n\n254.\n\n2) Secondly, if the Majority did not make an express finding of illegality of the expropriation, because it could not base it on its first finding (that the Respondent did not negotiate in good faith),while unable to derive its second finding (that the date of valuation is that of the award) directly from, and as a consequence of its first finding; in other words, if there is no way for the Majority to evade making an express finding of illegality in order legally to justify its second finding, on what other legal basis could it have founded such a declaration of illegality ?\n\n255.\n\ni- Invoking the *Chorzow Factory* case,116as does the Majority does not help in that regard. The Majority invokes it to argue that \"the compensation payable in respect of an unlawful taking of an investment\" in breach of a treaty obligation, cannot be determined according to the standard of that treaty set for compensation of lawful expropriations. It refers to the *Chorzow Factory* judgment - according to which the decision in such a case must be according to customary, *i.e.* general international law - in order to reach the result it seeks, namely that the valuation date should be that of the award.117\n\n*PCIJ, Rec.,* Series A No 17, Judgment No. 13 (Merits), (Sept. 13, 1928), pp. 46-47.\n\nDecision, para. 342.\n\n256.\n\nBut this is a pure exercise of circular thinking, for it starts by postulating what it is supposed to establish, namely the illegality of the expropriation. Even if one accepts that in case of an illegal expropriation (which is different from a violation of the treaty), the standard of the treaty for the compensation of expropriation does not apply (a much controverted proposition over which doctrine and cases are divided118), what is the solution provided by general international law ? It can be found in the *Chorzow Factory* judgment itself. It has to start by characterizing the breach itself under general international law, because one cannot characterize an act under one law and attach to it legal effects derived from another law.\n\nThe *Middle East Cement* Tribunal, after concluding that the measures taken by the Respondent were measures the effects of which amounted to expropriation in terms of Art. 4(a) of the BIT because not taken following due process of law, concluded that the Claimants was entitled to compensation in accordance with the standard of Art. 4(c) of the BIT was due by the Respondent (*Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Company SA v. Egypt,* Award, ICSID Case No ARB/99/6, 12 April 2002, paras. 139-144). The *Funnek* otter Tribunal also followed this line of reasoning and clearly stated that the strandard of compensation in the controlling BIT (\"just compensation\" and \"genuine value\" in Art. 6(c) of theNetherlands-Zimbawe BIT) and the standard in customary international law, were identical. See *Bernardus Henricus Funnedotter and oterhs v.Zimbabwe,* Award, ICSID Case No ARB/05/6, 22 April 2009m para, 115. Similarly in *Franz Sedelmayer v. the Russian Federation,* after finding that the Respondent had failed to prove the public purpose of the taking and hence concluding that it had breached Art. 4(1) of the BIT, the Tribunal decided that the Claimant was entitled to compensation in accordance with Art. 4(2) OF THE bit. (*Franz Sedelmayer v. the Russian Federation*, SCC Award, 7 July 1998, pp. 17-18). See also the *Tecmed* case where the Tribunal found that the non-renewal of a permit allegedly due to political pressure, did not fulfill the condition of public interest and hence constituted a breach of Art. 5(1) of the BIT, it applied for the purposes of calculating the awarded compensation, the standard of compensation agreed by the BIT parties in Art. 5(2) of the BIT (*tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA v. Mexico,* Award, ARB/AF/002m 29 May 2003, paras. 128,187,188.\n\n257.\n\nCutting through the maze and mystification that surrounds this old case, the solutions it lays down as being those of customary international law are relatively simple. It distinguishes between two types of breach of treaty obligations in the context of expropriation. The first is where the treaty prohibits the very act of expropriation, as in the *Chorzow Factory* case itself, where the purpose of the treaty was not so much the protection of their economic interests as the guarantee of the continued existence of the German settlers in the newly established States of East Europe after WWI. In this case, expropriation in violation of such prohibitive provisions renders the expropriation illegal *ab initio*, begetting the legal consequences of illegal expropriation. The other case is where the right of the State to expropriate is not limited as such. The Court which seems to confine the term - expropriation- to this case, describes it as one \"to render which lawful only the payment of fair compensation would have been wanting\"119, and defines the fair compensation due in this case as \"limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus interest to the day of payment\".120 Thus, the non-payment of compensation, according to the Court, in cases where the right of the State to expropriate is not restricted, does not entail a change in the standard of compensation, which remains that of fair or just compensation; the expropriated interests to be valued at the time of the taking. In other words, the non-payment of compensation does not render the expropriation illegal, as the Court does not attach to it the legal effects of an illegal expropriation, but the obligation to pay fair compensation remains outstanding.\n\n*Supra*, note 116, p. 46.\n\n*Ibid.* p. 47.\n\n258.\n\nApplied *in casu*, the first case corresponds to the cases provided for in Article 6(b) of the BIT. It is to be recalled that the Tribunal has unanimously rejected the part of the Claimants' claim based on that provision.121 This also means that the expropriation of the interests of the Claimants *in casu* falls under the second case, according to the *Chorzow Factory* analysis.\n\nDecision, paras. 334-352, particularly 352.\n\n259.\n\nii - Moving beyond *Chorzow* up to the present, a survey of the cases where a tribunal declared an expropriation illegal for non-payment of compensation shows that all of them, without any exception, fall in either one of two categories :\n\ni- cases where expropriation was contested by the State party but was found, by the tribunal, to be \"creeping\",122or \"indirect\"123expropriation; or\n\nii - cases where the expropriating State clearly refuses from the outset to pay compensation and consequently makes no offer.124\n\n*Siemens AG v.

Ecuador,* Decision on liability, ICSID Case No ARB/08/5, 14 December 2012, paras. 543-545.\n\n260.\n\nObviously, the expropriation *in casu* does not fall in either of the two above categories. It was not \"creeping\" or \"indirect\" as it was effected through open legal processes and instruments; and was preceded by a concrete offer.\n\n261.\n\niii - Remains, as potential ground of illegality, the Claimants' contention that the offer was \"grossly inadequate\", meaning \"illusory\" or negligible amounting to a refusal to pay compensation and thus falling in the second above category. Apart from the fact that an offer of 2.3 billion US dollars is hardly negligible, and in spite of the wide ranging estimations of the Claimants, it is worth recalling that this offer corresponded almost exactly to the internal estimates of the two Projects by the Claimants themselves, dated October 2006 and January 2007, just a few months before the expropriation (above, para. 154ff).\n\n262.\n\nThis is not, however, the main point here. What is crucial is the fact that this contention has not been examined, verified or pronounced upon in the Decision, though the unfolding reasoning of the Majority left one with the impression that the Majority has admitted it implicitly. But at the penultimate page of the text, the \"without prejudice\" reservation of the Majority in paragraph 402 - that the Tribunal had made no determination on the possible relevance of the compensation clauses to the determination of the quantum of the compensation - negatived this impression of an implicit finding or presumption of illegality of the expropriation (on the basis of the gross inadequacy of the initial offer).\n\n263.\n\nHowever, without a decision of the Tribunal on the question of the relevance of the compensation clauses, it cannot pronounce itself on the adequacy or gross inadequacy of the Respondent's offer, which in turn is needed as prerequisite for any decision it might take on the legality of the expropriation.\n\n264.\n\nWe thus have a Decision the main finding of which - that of the illegality of the expropriation - cannot be found anywhere in its text. It has to be deduced by implication from another finding, an express one this time - that the date of valuation is that of the award - which is an alleged legal effect of an illegal expropriation.\n\n265.\n\nBeing implicit means that this major finding is not given any clear and precise legal justification and grounding in the Decision, *i.e.* any legal \"motivation\". It is true that certain potential grounds, such as the *Chorzhow Factory* judgment are mentioned in discussing the legal issues in general. But as the above survey shows, none of the potential grounds is applicable (or even possible) *in casu*. And in any case none is specifically designated by the Decision as legal ground for its finding that it did not pronounce explicitly and did not include in its *dispositif* of paragraph 404.\n\n266.\n\nThe Decision thus leaves us with an amusing legal riddle, to guess and find for ourselves what can be the legal ground of the non-pronounced determination of illegality of expropriation. Hardly a \"judicial motivation\".\n\n267.\n\nIf one interprets charitably the Decision, considering that it did not make a finding of illegality of the expropriation, as it does not appear in the *dispositif* of paragraph 404, the dilemma remains whole. For, under this interpretation the finding of paragraph 404(e) - that the date of valuation is the date of the award - will be left hanging in the air, without any legal ground to stand on.\n\n**2) *Serious departures from Due Process***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe Decision takes great liberty with the principles and rules of procedure, particularly in relation to evidence and the burden of proof, some of which constitute serious departures from due process. A few examples suffice.\n\n269.\n\na) A glaring example of the temperamental way of the Majority in handling proof, is the variable geometry it showed in dealing with the issue of good faith in two different parts of the Decision. In examining, under jurisdiction, a preliminary objection based on the concept of \"corporations of convenience\", the Tribunal starts its analysis with the following sentence :\n\n\"It [the Tribunal] will do that bearing in mind how rarely courts and tribunals have held that a good faith or other related standard is breached. The standard is a high one\".125\n\nDecision, para. 275.\n\n270.\n\nThis follows closely the classical dictum on the subject in the *Tacna-Arica* Arbitration (1925) :\n\n\"A finding of the existence of bad faith should be supported not bydisputable inferences but by clear and convincing evidence which compels such a conclusion\"126\n\nAnd indeed, the present Tribunal, unanimously, rejected the objection.\n\nR.I.A.A. vol. 2, p. 930.\n\n271.\n\nHowever, when it came to the proof of bad faith of the Respondent in the negotiations over compensation, the Majority relies exclusively on inference from hypothetical premises extrapolated from partly erroneous findings of fact, as abundantly shown above (*e.g.* para.211ff)\n\n272.\n\nb) Another example is provided in paragraph 393 of the Decision, in which the Majority enumerates the indices it uses to conclude, in the following paragraph, that the Respondent did not negotiate in good faith during the first period of negotiations. The indices it cites are basically that the Respondents' representatives did not answer the Claimants' letters of 12 April 2007, and did not reject a statement attributed to them that compensation will not be based on market value. In other words, the Majority posits that not answering letters immediately and not rejecting what they attribute to the recipient, are sufficient proof of the veracity of the contents of those letters; even when these contents are vigorously contested later on in litigation. A truly innovative rule that has no equivalent in any system of procedure and particularly not in international procedural law.\n\n273.\n\nEven more interesting are the last two sentences of the same paragraph 393 of the Decision, which read :\n\n\" The Tribunal does of course recognize, in terms of the ruling made earlier in this decision that the royalty and tax changes are not in its view in breach of the BIT. But that was not known to the Parties at that stage of their negotiations.\"\n\n274.\n\nThis unsolicited defense of the attitude of the Claimants claiming much beyond the market value of the assets in the negotiations, by invoking that they didn't know they had no right to that addition, strongly contrasts with the highly suspicious attitude towards the Respondent. For had the Majority had the same solicitude towards the Respondent, it could have found a parallel excuse on their behalf : that even if Dr.Mommer, had really said that Venezuela would not pay market value (which he forcefully rejected), such a statement could be explained by the fact that he was thinking of the compensation clauses in the Agreements (which he probably was) as qualifying the market value (and which are not ruled upon yet anyway, in contrast to the claim of compensation for royalty and tax charges which was dismissed by the Tribunal).\n\n275.\n\nc) A third example is the treatment by the Majority of the testimonies of Dr. Mommer, which has been described at different junctures of this Opinion.\n\n276.\n\nTo recapitulate briefly, the Majority in reconstituting in its analysis the process of negotiations, limited itself to the documentary evidence put before it specifically for that purpose. And as the Claimants, since their trigger letter of January 2007 were clearly preparing a litigating file, while Venezuela was, probably for the same reason, suspicious of epistolary negotiations, the Majority relied heavily on ConocoPhilipps' sources. All it had before it from the Venezuelan side were the testimonies of Dr. Mommer; and even the letters appended thereto were letters from ConocoPhilipps, not from Venezuelan sources. And it is these testimonies of Dr. Mommer that the Majority systematically discredited, and where it could not, it discarded as irrelevant.\n\n277.\n\nThus, in discrediting Dr. Mommers refutal of the statement attributed to him that Venezuela will not pay market value, the Majority restates his response as \"he did not think he had said [so]\"127. Then the Majority immediately discredits this testimony by describing it as a \"general denial, made only at the hearings and not in the two rounds of written testimony\".128 This expeditive dismissal is based on two basic errors. In the first place, the Majority suddenly forgets a paragraph in Dr.Mommer's first \"Direct Testimony\", filled almost a year before the oral hearings, that the Majority reproduces in the Decision,129three pages before, in which he generally but firmly rejects such allegations. The second error is in reporting Dr. Mommer's answers in cross-examination, which verges on misrepresentation of his twice forceful answers, first politely \"I don't think I ever said something like that\", then more directly \"I think that witness statement [Lyons'] is incorrect\" (see above, para. 79ff).\n\nDecision, para. 392.\n\nDecision, para. 393.\n\nDecision, para. 385.\n\n278.\n\nThen again, in trying to prove that the Confidentiality Agreement would not have restrained Venezuela from submitting to the Tribunal any new proposals it would have made during the second period of negotiations, had it made any; the Majority gives as proof the fact that Dr. Mommer submitted as annexes to his first testimony the two letters of ConocoPhillipps containing their counter-offers of June and August 2007. The Majority was thus assuming that these counter-offers were covered by the Confidentiality Agreement, and were submitted all the same. It extrapolates from this a presumption of a constant course of conduct on the part of Venezuela that it would not hesitate to act in violation of its obligations, in order to advance its interests. But all that hypothetical construction is built on an error of fact, as the Confidentiality Agreement had not been concluded yet when the two letters of ConocoPhilipps were sent in June and August 2007 (see above, para. 211ff above).\n\n279.\n\nFinally, the explanation in Dr. Mommer's first \"Direct Testimony\" that the first and foremost reason for Venezuela's rejection of ConocoPhilipps' counter-offers was that they did not take into consideration the compensation clauses in the Associations Agreements, could not logically be discredited. But the Majority discarded it all the same as irrelevant, on the artificial argument that his explanation that this was an overriding consideration for Venezuela's rejection of the counteroffer, does not mean that it was invoked or mentioned in the negotiations (above para. 219ff).\n\n280.\n\nAll these inferential acrobatics and liberties taken with the rules of evidence and procedure were necessary for the Majority to eliminate the main obstacle to attain the result it sought to reach, namely that the initial offer of Venezuela was wanting and that no other effort was made later on.\n\nd) a fourth example is also given in paragraph 284 below.\n\n**3) *The Decision is* Ultra Petita *hence* Ultra Vires**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nIn paragraph 404, constituting the *dispositif* of the Decision, the Majority finds that :\n\n\"... (d) the Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhilipps assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT\".\n\n282.\n\nThis is the very first time in the huge record of this case, comprising hundreds of thousands pages of written and oral proceedings, that the issue of good faith of the Respondent in the negotiations over compensation appears; in the Decision on the Merits. No such claim of bad faith appears in any of the Claimants' submissions, from the Request of Arbitration to the post-hearings briefs. Nor was it raised or contended by any of their Counsel and witnesses in the oral hearings. Nor was it raised by way of question to the Parties from the bench. An utter decision by surprise.\n\n283.\n\nAs it does not respond to any submission of the Parties, this finding is *ultra petita*, *i.e.* it lies beyond the requests of the Parties which define *inter alia* the ambit and limits of the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of a tribunal in a given case; and as such the decision bearing this finding is *ultra vires*.\n\n284.\n\nBesides, considered from a procedural point of view, the manner in which this matter was handled leaves much to be desired. The Majority centered its decision on an issue that had not been raised or addressed by the Parties, and to which their attention was not drawn by the Tribunal to illicit their opinion. In particular, the Respondent, who was found responsible for a most serious internationally wrongful conduct on that basis, was not given the opportunity to present its position on the matter.\n\n285.\n\nBy proceeding in this manner, the Majority committed a serious violation of the procedural rights of the Parties, particularly the Respondent, and of the fundamental principle of even handedness and equality of arms between the Parties; that which constitutes a serious departure from due process.\n\nFor all these reasons, I dissent from the findings of the Tribunal under (d) and (e) of paragraph 404 of the Decision"}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits\n-----------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **GLOSSARY OF ABBREVIATIONS** | |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| Association Agreement for the Corocoro | Association Agreement between Corporation |\n| Project | Venezolana del Petr\u00f3leo, S.A. and Conoco Venezuela B.V. dated 10 July 1996 |\n| BPD | Barrels per day |\n| Bicameral Report | Report Approved by the Bicameral Commission for the Study of the Strategic Associations of PdVSA concerning the Projects Maraven-Conoco and Maraven-Total-Itochu-Maruveni for the Exploitation and Upgrading of Extra-Heavy Petroleum of the Orinoco Oil Belt, dated 12 August 1993 |\n| BIT or Treaty | Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela signed on 22 October 1991 |\n| Claimants | ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V., ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. and ConocoPhillips Company, collectively |\n| Cl.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of (a) the Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments *(Decreto con Rango y Fuerza de Ley de Promotion y Protection de Inversiones)* published on 22 October 1999 (the \"Investment Law\");1 and (b) the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela signed on 22 October 1991 (the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\"),2 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 18 March 1965 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\nEx. C-l and Ex. R-12, *Decreto N\u00b0 356, Decreto con Rango y Fuerza de Ley de Promotion y Protection de Inversiones* (Decree No. 356, Decree with Rank and Force of Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments) (the \"Investment Law\" or the \"Decree Law\"), Official Gazette No. 5,390 (Extraordinary), published 22 October 1999.\n\nEx. C-2 and Ex. R-13, Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela (with Protocol) signed on 22 October 1991, entered into force 1 November 1993, 1788 U.N.T.S. 45.\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute concerns the interests of Claimants in two extra-heavy oil projects located in the region in Venezuela known as the Orinoco Oil Belt *(Faja Petrol\u00edfera del Orinoco) -* the \"Petrozuata Project\" and the \"Hamaca Project\", and in an offshore project for the extract of light to medium crude oil - the \"Corocoro Project\".\n\n3.\n\nThe Petrozuata Project was conducted through the Petrozuata Association, which was granted the rights to engage in the exploration, development, production, exploitation, transportation and upgrading of extra-heavy crude oil, and the marketing of the resulting crude oils and products, in the Zuata area of the Orinoco Oil Belt.3\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration dated 2 November 2007 (\"RFA\") \u00b6 41(a).\n\n4.\n\nThe Hamaca Project was conducted through the Hamaca Association, which held the rights to engage in the exploration, development, production, exploitation, blending, industrialisation, transportation, refining and upgrading and commercialisation of extra-heavy crude oil, and the transportation and use or disposal of by-products, in the Hamaca area of the Orinoco Oil Belt.4\n\nRFA \u00b6 41(b).\n\n5.\n\nThe Corocoro Project was one of eight joint ventures for the exploration and production of conventional crude oil under Profit Sharing Agreements.5 The Corocoro Project was conducted through the Corocoro Development Consortium, which had the rights to explore, discover, evaluate, develop and exploit commercial hydrocarbons reservoirs within the Gulf of Paria West, including the handling of any production from such reservoirs and the transportation of production.6\n\nCounter-Memorial of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela dated 27 July 2009 (\"Resp. C-Mem\") \u00b615.\n\nRFA \u00b6 40(c).\n\n6.\n\nThe principal events on which the Claimants base their claims for compensation under the Investment Law and the Treaty include the following:7\n\na. Venezuela through various actions increased the effective royalty rate applicable to the extra-heavy oil production of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Associations from one percent to 33.33 percent.\n\nb. Venezuela amended the tax law so that the tax on income derived from extraheavy oil production was raised from 34 percent to 50 percent.\n\nc. Venezuela by Decree Law (i) mandated PdVSA to assume operational control of oil projects, including the Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro Projects, and (ii) provided for cancellation of the exploration, production and commercialisation rights of the Associations and the Corocoro Project, and the transfer of such rights to mixed companies controlled by PdVSA - *\"Empresas Mixtas' -* on terms to be agreed by 26 June 2007. The compensation provided for in the Decree Law was a minority interest in the Empresas Mixtas.\n\nd. On 1 May 2007, a PdVSA subsidiary took control over operations at the Projects.\n\ne. On 26 June 2007, the four-month period for reaching agreement set in the Decree Law expired and Venezuela nationalised ConocoPhillips\u2019 interests in the Projects.\n\nThe factual context and details of these measures are discussed further at Section IV.F below.\n\nRFA \u00b6\u00b6 9-13.\n\n**II.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n10.\n\nOn 2 November 2007, the Claimants submitted to the Centre a Request for Arbitration against Venezuela pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n11.\n\nThe proceeding was brought under (a) the Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments *(Decreto con Rango y Fuerza de Ley de Promotion y Protection de Inversiones)* published on 22 October 1999; and (b) the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela signed on 22 October 1991.\n\n12.\n\nOn 13 December 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and Rules 6(l)(a) and 7(a) of the Institution Rules. Pursuant to Rule 7(d) of the Institution Rules, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed as soon as possible with the constitution of the tribunal in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 12 February 2008, the Claimants requested that \u2014 in the absence of an agreement on the procedure for constitution of the tribunal \u2014the tribunal be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. By separate letter to the Respondent, the Claimants nominated, Mr L. Yves Fortier, CC, QC, a national of Canada, as arbitrator and proposed the appointment of Mr Emmanuel Gaillard, a national of France, as President of the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated 20 February 2008, the Centre notified the Parties that Mr Fortier had accepted his appointment as arbitrator and provided a copy of Mr Fortier\u2019s declaration made in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2).\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated 11 March 2008, the Respondent agreed that the tribunal would be composed of three arbitrators, the first two to be appointed by the parties and the president to be appointed by agreement of the parties, in consultation with the two party-appointed arbitrators. The Respondent noted that it did not agree with the proposed appointment of Mr Gaillard as president of the tribunal, and requested additional time to designate its party-appointed arbitrator.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated 13 March 2008, the Claimants objected to the Respondent\u2019s request for the extension of the deadline for appointment of its party-appointed arbitrator. The Claimants also indicated that they did not consent to the Respondent\u2019s proposed procedure for appointment of the president of the tribunal and requested that, in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, the Chairman of the Administrative Council appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the Respondent and a president of the tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter dated 14 March 2008, the Centre informed the Parties that, pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, they would soon be consulted with respect to the appointment of the remaining arbitrators. The Centre also confirmed that, until the process for appointment under Article 38 was completed, the missing arbitrators could be appointed in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention.\n\n18.\n\nOn 31 March 2008, the Respondent designated Sir Ian Brownlie, CBE, QC, a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator. By letter dated 3 April 2008, ICSID informed the Parties that Sir Ian Brownlie had accepted his appointment as arbitrator and provided a copy of Sir Ian Brownlie\u2019s declaration and accompanying statement made in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2).\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated 15 April 2008, the Respondent stated that it was hopeful that the Parties would reach agreement on an appointee for president of the tribunal and suggested that ICSID refrain for a reasonable period of time from proposing a candidate. On 16 April 2008, the Claimants objected to any further delay in the appointment of a president of the tribunal and urged the Chairman of the Administrative Council to proceed with that appointment. On 2 May 2008, each Party informed the Centre that no agreement had been reached for the appointment of a presiding arbitrator.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated 8 May 2008, the Centre informed the Parties that the Permanent Court of Arbitration would be asked to provide the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council with a recommendation on the appointment of the presiding arbitrator.\n\n21.\n\nOn 29 May 2008, the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration invited the Parties to provide their views regarding the profile of an appropriate presiding arbitrator. Each Party provided its observations on 5 June 2008.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated 13 June 2008, the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration informed the Parties of its intention to recommend to the Chairman of the Administrative Council that Judge Kenneth Keith, a national of New Zealand, be appointed as presiding arbitrator, and invited them to make comments on this proposal.\n\n23.\n\nOn 1 July 2008, the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration recommended to the Chairman of the Administrative Council that he appoint Judge Keith as the presiding arbitrator. On 11 July 2008, the Centre informed the Parties that the Chairman of the Administrative Council had appointed Judge Keith as the president of the tribunal. By letter dated 18 July 2008, Judge Keith accepted his appointment as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter dated 23 July 2008, the Centre informed the Parties that all of the arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceeding to have begun on that date. Mr Gonzalo Flores, ICSID, was designated by the Secretary-General of ICSID to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n25.\n\nOn 10 September 2008, Ms Katia Yannaca-Small, ICSID, was appointed as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n26.\n\nThe First Session of the Tribunal was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague on 13 September 2008.

The Tribunal also requested the Parties to consult about the timetable for the filing of further written pleadings and to report to the Tribunal on their proposals.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter dated 26 January 2009, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal reconsider its decision in Procedural Order No. 1 not to bifurcate the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration from the merits and quantum, and requested a hearing on the issue of bifurcation.\n\n34.\n\nOn 29 January 2009, the Claimants objected to the Respondent\u2019s requests in its letter of 26 January 2009 and submitted that the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Procedural Order No. 1 should stand.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter dated 29 January 2009, the Respondent submitted further observations on its request for reconsideration of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n36.\n\nOn 9 February 2009, the Centre informed the Parties that the Tribunal had confirmed its decision in Procedural Order No. 1 and saw no reason to have a hearing on the matter. The Tribunal also requested the Parties to consult about the timetable on the filing of further written pleadings.\n\n37.\n\nOn 19 February 2009, the Respondent proposed a briefing schedule to the Tribunal. The Claimants made a counter-proposal on 20 February 2009.\n\n38.\n\nOn 26 February 2009, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had fixed the following timetable: (a) the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial to be filed by 24 July 2009; (b) the Claimants\u2019 Reply to be filed by 23 October 2009; and the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder to be filed by 22 January 2010. The Tribunal also confirmed that the hearing dates would be determined at a later stage.\n\n39.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 observations, the Tribunal, by letter dated 7 May 2009, proposed to hold a two-week hearing in The Hague, from 31 May 2010 to 11 June 2010. These dates were later confirmed by the Tribunal.\n\n40.\n\nOn 7 July 2009, the Tribunal agreed to the Parties\u2019 request of 6 July 2009 to amend the briefing schedule.\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on 27 July 2009.\n\n42.\n\nOn 24 August 2009, the Claimants submitted their First Request for the Production of Documents.

The Centre also confirmed that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 12, the proceeding had resumed as of that day.\n\n46.\n\nOne consequence of the replacement of an arbitrator at that stage of the proceedings was that the deliberations of the members of the Tribunal, following the hearings scheduled for May to July 2010, could not begin until early 2011.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on 1 February 2010.\n\n48.\n\nBy letter dated 24 February 2010, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to hold a pre-hearing conference for purposes of discussing hearing procedures.\n\n49.\n\nA pre-hearing telephone conference was held on 11 March 2010.\n\n50.\n\nOn 19 March 2010, the Claimants submitted their Second Request for the Production of Documents.\n\n51.\n\nOn 23 March 2010, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, which established a provisional agenda for the hearing scheduled to take place from 31 May to 12 June 2010. Procedural Order No. 2 also provided that a hearing would be scheduled for the presentation of closing arguments on 21 and 23 July, 2010 in The Hague.

Mr Fortier stated that it had been brought to his attention as a result of conflict checks that had been conducted that Macleod Dixon LLP had provided and continued to provide legal services to ConocoPhillips Company, and was also acting adverse to the interests of the Respondent in other matters, including in a separate ICSID arbitration. On the same day, the Centre communicated Mr Fortier\u2019s disclosure to the Parties.\n\n69.\n\nBy letter dated 5 October 2011, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr Fortier pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n70.\n\nOn 6 October 2011, the Centre informed the Parties that the proceeding was suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n71.\n\nOn 12 October 2011, the President of the Tribunal, having consulted with Professor Abi-Saab, set a timetable for the Parties to submit observations and Mr Fortier to furnish explanations as provided for under Arbitration Rule 9.\n\n72.\n\nOn 13 October 2011, the Respondent made a further submission and provided details of the legal authorities upon which it relied in support of its disqualification proposal.\n\n73.\n\nOn 14 October 2011, the Parties were requested by Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab to submit any observations that they wished to make within the framework of the existing briefing schedule.\n\n74.\n\nOn 18 October 2011, Mr Fortier informed Judge Keith, Professor Abi-Saab and the Parties of his decision to resign from the firm Norton Rose OR LLP effective as of 31 December 2011. Mr Fortier confirmed that, as of that date, his relationship with the firm would cease entirely.\n\n75.\n\nBy letter dated 19 October 2011, the Claimants asserted that, in light of Mr Fortier\u2019s 18 October 2011 letter, no basis remained for the Respondent\u2019s proposal to disqualify Mr Fortier and invited the Respondent to confirm the same.\n\n76.\n\nOn 19 October 2011, the Respondent stated that it was considering the issue and requested responses to the questions raised in its 13 October 2011 submission.\n\n77.\n\nBy letter dated 24 October 2011, the Respondent stated that it continued to propose the disqualification of Mr Fortier as an arbitrator.\n\n78.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Disqualification Proposal on 25 October 2011.\n\n79.\n\nOn 27 October 2011, in view of the Parties\u2019 correspondence of 26 October 2011, the Parties were requested to make their further submissions within the timetable established by Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab on 12 October 2011.\n\n80.\n\nOn 28 October 2011, Mr Fortier requested an extension of the date for submission of his explanations. On 31 October 2011, Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab granted the extension requested.\n\n81.\n\nOn 18 November 2011, Mr Fortier submitted his further explanations in connection with the Respondent\u2019s disqualification proposal.\n\n82.\n\nOn 1 December, 2011, the Respondent submitted its final observations in response to the Claimants\u2019 submission of 25 October 2011 and Mr Fortier\u2019s explanations of 18 November 2011.\n\n83.\n\nClaimants submitted their Additional Observations Concerning the Respondent\u2019s Disqualification Proposal on 2 December 2011.\n\n84.\n\nIn their decision dated 27 February 2012, Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab rejected the Respondent\u2019s proposal for disqualification of Mr Fortier. By letter of even date, the Centre informed the Parties that the proceeding was no longer suspended and had resumed.\n\n85.\n\nThe challenge and the process leading to its determination had as a consequence a further delay in the deliberation of the members of the Tribunal.\n\n86.\n\nOn 28 February 2012, the Respondent submitted evidence regarding recent developments that it claimed had a bearing on issues in the case relating to quantum. On the same day, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to rule that the Respondent\u2019s submission was inadmissible and otherwise to have an opportunity to respond. Later that day, the Respondent made observations regarding the Claimants\u2019 request to declare the Respondent\u2019s submission inadmissible. By letter dated 2 March 2012, the Tribunal admitted the Respondent\u2019s submission and invited the Claimants to submit observations on the recent developments that the Respondent\u2019s submission addressed. On 16 March 2012, the Claimants submitted observations on the Respondent\u2019s submission. On 18 March 2012, the Respondent submitted further observations on its submission. On 19 March 2012, the Claimants objected to the Respondent\u2019s most recent observations and requested an opportunity to respond. By letter dated 20 March 2012, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to provide any further comments that they might have. On 27 March 2012, the Claimants filed their supplemental observations. On 28 March 2012, the Respondent indicated that it would be ready to conduct a further hearing on quantum issues should the Tribunal have questions regarding the materials that it had submitted.\n\n87.\n\nBy letter dated 25 May 2012, the Claimants requested permission from the Tribunal to submit new information. By letter dated 8 June 2012, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Claimants\u2019 request. On 4 July 2012, the Tribunal granted the Claimants\u2019 request and set a timetable for the Claimants to submit the relevant evidence and for the Respondent to submit a response to that evidence. The Claimants filed their new evidence on 11 July 2012. On 25 July 2012, the Respondent provided its responsive observations. On 3 August and 5 August 2012, the Claimants and the Respondent, respectively, submitted further observations. By letter dated 7 August 2012, the Tribunal indicated that it did not at that time require additional information but would revert to the Parties should the need arise.\n\n88.\n\nOn 22 October 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had made significant progress in its decision-making and envisaged issuing findings early in 2013.\n\n89.\n\nOn 21 November 2012, Mr Gonzalo Flores was re-appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal, following Ms Janet Whittaker's departure from ICSID\u2019s Secretariat.\n\n90.\n\nBy letter of 27 December 2012, Respondent brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention a decision on liability issued on 14 December 2012 in ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5 *(Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador).* Claimants\u2019 submitted observations to Respondent\u2019s letter on 3 January 2013. By letter of 4 January 2013, Respondent replied to Claimants\u2019 letter of 3 January 2013.\n\n91.\n\nBy letter of 11 February 2013, Respondent brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention a decision on jurisdiction issued of 8 February 2013 in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 *(Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela).* Claimants\u2019 submitted observations to Respondent\u2019s letter on 18 February 2013 and, on that same date, Respondent submitted a brief reply.\n\n92.\n\nBy letters of 26 March and 26 July 2013, the Tribunal reported further on the progress made with respect to its deliberation, informing the parties of a medical proceeding undergone by Professor Georges Abi-Saab and of the impact of such proceeding in the progress of the Tribunal\u2019s work.\n\n**IV.

In order to improve Venezuela\u2019s oil production, it was considered necessary to: (a) encourage private investment in the oil sector; (b) rejuvenate existing fields; (c) develop Venezuela\u2019s oil resources of extra-heavy crude oil; and (d) explore new fields of light and medium crude.32\n\nCl.

The Petrozuata Project**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1) Overview of the Petrozuata Project**\n------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Petrozuata Project was a vertically integrated project in the Orinoco Belt involved in the extraction, transportation, refining of extra-heavy crude oil, and the marketing of the upgraded crude oil (known as \"syncrude\").38 ConocoPhillips held a 50.1 percent interest in the Petrozuata Project, with the remaining 49.9% held by a PdVSA affiliate. The Petrozuata Project was designed to extract about 120,000 barrels per day (\"BPD\") of extra-heavy crude and to upgrade it into 104,000 BPD of syncrude. The Project\u2019s term was 35 years. Petrozuata syncrude was sold to ConocoPhillips under an offtake agreement for further refining at its Lake Charles refinery, which ConocoPhillips reconfigured to process Petrozuata syncrude.39 Further details about the Petrozuata Project are set forth below.\n\n*See generally* Cl. Closing Skeleton, Annex, \"An Overview of the Projects\".\n\nThe Claimants assert that Conoco invested hundreds of millions of dollars to modify its Lake Charles refinery so that it could process the Petrozuata syncrude. *See* Cl.

The Claimants\u2019 Requests for Relief**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nIn their Request for Arbitration, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal:217\n\n(a) DECLARE that Venezuela has breached:\n\n(i) Article 11 of the Foreign Investment Law and Article 6 of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating and/or taking measures equivalent to expropriation with respect to ConocoPhillips\u2019 investments in Venezuela;\n\nand\n\n(ii) Articles 1 and 6 of the Foreign Investment Law and Article 3 of the Treaty by failing to accord ConocoPhillips\u2019 investments in Venezuela fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, and by taking arbitrary and discriminatory measures impairing the use and enjoyment of its investments in Venezuela;\n\n(b) ORDER Venezuela to pay damages to ConocoPhillips for its breaches of the Foreign Investment Law and the Treaty in an amount to be determined at a later stage in these proceedings, including by payment of compound interest at such a rate and for such period as the Tribunal considers just and appropriate;\n\n(c) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate; and\n\n(d) ORDER Venezuela to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including ConocoPhillips\u2019 legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID\u2019s other costs.\n\nRFA \u00b6 130.\n\n213.\n\nIn their Memorial, the Claimants reiterated that:218\n\nVenezuela\u2019s persistent and intentional breaches of its obligations to ConocoPhillips have given rise to the claims asserted herein. Venezuela has violated its obligations to ConocoPhillips Company under the Foreign Investment Law. Venezuela has also violated its obligations to the Dutch subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips Company -CPZ, CPH and CGP - under the bilateral investment treaty between the Netherlands and Venezuela.\n\nCl.

The Respondent\u2019s Requests**\n--------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nIn its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent asserts that:221\n\nWith respect to the jurisdictional objections, the claims set forth in the Request should be dismissed in their entirety inasmuch as: (i) Article 22 of the Investment Law does not provide a basis for finding \"consent\" on the part of the Republic to arbitration of this dispute; (ii) ConocoPhillips does not qualify as an \"international investor\" as defined in the Investment Law Regulation, and thus would not be entitled to bring claims under the Investment Law concerning the Projects even if Article 22 did constitute a consent to jurisdiction; (iii) Claimants CPZ, CPH and CGP are merely corporations of convenience created for the purpose of obtaining ICSID jurisdiction in this case in an abuse of the corporate form and therefore jurisdiction under the Dutch Treaty should be rejected; and (iv) the interests held by Claimants CPH and CGP in any event are indirect investments which do not qualify for protection under the Dutch Treaty.\n\nResp. Mem. on Objections to Jurisdiction \u00b6 183.\n\n217.\n\nThe Respondent, in its Counter-Memorial reiterated that \"[f]or the reasons set forth above and in the Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, the claims should be rejected in their entirety for lack of jurisdiction\".222 The Respondent further stated that:223\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal were to find jurisdiction on any of the claims asserted, those claims should nevertheless be dismissed for the substantive reasons set forth above. In the event that the claims are not rejected in their entirety for lack of jurisdiction or on the merits, the aggregate amount of compensation in respect of the three Projects should not exceed US$583 million, with simple interest. In addition, Claimants should be ordered to reimburse Respondent for all reasonable costs and expenses, including legal fees, relating to this Arbitration.\n\nResp. C-Mem.\u00b6 351.\n\nResp.

Further, the Respondent stated that, if the claims are not rejected in their entirety, \"the aggregate amount of compensation in respect of the three Projects should not exceed US$570.5 million, with simple interest\".224\n\nRejoinder of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela dated 1 February 2010 (\"Resp. Rej.\") \u00b6 577.\n\n**VI. JURISDICTION**\n--------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe preamble to the ICSID Convention declares that a Contracting State by the mere fact of ratifying, accepting or approving the Convention is not under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration. Under Article 25 of the Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre extends to a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State that the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\n\n220.\n\nOn the adoption of the Convention, the Executive Directors of the World Bank in their report of 18 March 1965 affirmed that \"[c]onsent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre\".225 That consent of the two parties they said and, as subsequent decisions have confirmed, need not be expressed in a single instrument: in particular, \"a host State might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit disputes arising out of certain classes of investments to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and the investor might give his consent by accepting the offer in writing\".226\n\nReport of the Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention\"), \u00b6 23.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention, \u00b6 24.\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimants gave their consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre over their claims, which are the subject of this proceeding, in their letter of 31 January 2007 advising the Minister of Energy and Petroleum, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General of Venezuela of the existence of a dispute arising in relation to the measures taken by Venezuela.227\n\nEx. C-36 *supra* at fn. 198.\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Venezuela gave its consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre under:\n\na. Article 22 of the Investment Law;228 and\n\nb. Article 9 of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT.229\n\nEx. C-l and Ex. R-12, Investment Law, Art. 22.\n\nEx. C-2 and Ex. R-13, Treaty, Art. 9.\n\n223.\n\nIn their Memorial, the Claimants invoke:230\n\n\u2022 the Investment Law as the basis for jurisdiction over the claims made by ConocoPhillips Company, a national of a State Party to the Convention (the United States of America), and Venezuela, also a State Party to the Convention; and\n\n\u2022 the BIT as the basis of jurisdiction over the claims made by the three Dutch Claimants.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 261-88.\n\n224.\n\nThe Respondent objects to both the Investment Law and the BIT as bases for jurisdiction.\n\n**B. Article 22 of the Investment Law**\n---------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nArticle 22 of the Investment Law provides as follows:\n\n*Las controversias que surjan entre un inversionista internacional, cuyo pais de origen tenga vigente con Venezuela un tratado o acuerdo sobre promotion y protection de inversiones, o las controversias respecto de las cuales sean aplicables las disposiciones del Convenio Constitutivo del Organismo Multilateral de Garant\u00eda de Inversiones (OMGI - MIGA) o del Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de Otros Estados (CIADI), ser\u00e1n sometidas al arbitraje internacional en los t\u00e9rminos del respectivo tratado o acuerdo, si as\u00ed este lo establece, sin perjuicio de la posibilidad de hacer uso, cuando proceda, de las v\u00edas contenciosas contempladas en la legislation venezolana vigente.*\n\nThe translations into English provided by the Parties differ in detail. Venezuela\u2019s translation is as follows:231\n\nDisputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and protection of investments, or disputes to which are applicable the provisions of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI-MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides, without prejudice to the possibility of making use, when appropriate, of the dispute resolution means provided for under the Venezuelan legislation in effect.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 translation is to this effect:232\n\nDisputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in effect a treaty or agreement for the promotion and protection of investments with Venezuela, or any disputes to which apply the provisions of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration under the terms provided for in the respective treaty or agreement, should it so provide, without prejudice to the possibility of using, when applicable, the systems of litigation provided for in the Venezuelan laws in force.\n\nWhile there are small differences between those translations the Parties do not see them as significant.233 Nor does the Tribunal.\n\nEx. R-12, Investment Law, Art. 22.\n\nEx. C-l, Investment Law, Art. 22. *See supra* fh. 174.\n\nSee, e.g., Tr. Day 1:81-82.\n\n226.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Venezuela gave its consent to jurisdiction through Article 22; Venezuela rejects that interpretation. Venezuela also submits that, wholly apart from the question of consent, jurisdiction over the claims made by ConocoPhillips Company is lacking because it does not qualify as an \"international investor\" under the Investment Law and therefore is not within the scope of Article 22.234 The Claimants reject that contention.\n\nResp.\u2019s Mem. on Objections to Jurisdiction \u00b6 126.\n\n227.\n\nThe Parties agree, as indeed Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, reflecting a long and well established principle, makes clear, that \"the Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence\".\n\n228.\n\nThe Parties disagree, however, on the following matters relating to the interpretation of Article 22 of the Investment Law:\n\na. the starting point : must Article 22 state the consent of Venezuela clearly and unequivocally, or is the provision to be interpreted objectively and in good faith?\n\nb. the applicable law : is Article 22 to be interpreted in accordance with Venezuelan law or international law or on some other basis? If international law is applicable, is it the law relating to the interpretation of treaties or some other area of international law that is to be applied?\n\nc. the text of Article 22 : in the light of the answers to the two preceding questions, what is the meaning of the text?\n\n229.\n\nIn relation to the third issue, the Parties addressed: the words and structure of Article 22, its plain or ordinary meaning, its object and purpose, its context, both immediate and over a longer period, including the Respondent\u2019s attitude to international arbitration and to arbitration generally; the opinions of commentators, including those said to be involved in the preparation of the Investment Law; and the discussion of those issues in decisions of tribunals in other ICSID cases holding that Article 22 did not incorporate a unilateral consent by Venezuela to ICSID arbitration.235\n\n*Mobil Corporation et al. v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction dated 8 February 2013 *(\"Tidewater\")*\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal will now address those issues and, in the light of its conclusions on them, particularly the third issue, to which the Parties gave most attention, determine whether the Respondent, by enacting Article 22 of the Investment Law, has given its consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n**(1) The Starting Point**\n--------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Respondent contends that to satisfy the requirement of consent in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the statement of consent must be \"clear and unequivocal\" and not merely arguable from ambiguous language.236 In support of that proposition, it cites ICSID decisions and ICSID commentaries including a statement by the drafters of the ICSID Model Clauses recording consent: \"[t]he one basic requirement that any consent clause must fulfil is that it should unequivocally show submission to the jurisdiction of the Centre of a particular dispute or class of disputes\".237 It also refers to a statement by the International Court of Justice to the effect that the consent to the jurisdiction of that Court must be \"voluntary and indisputable\",238 and to commentators similarly urging the Court to be cautious in assuming jurisdiction.239\n\nResp.

Reply \u00b6 217.\n\n**(2) The Applicable Law**\n--------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Investment Law, as part of the law of Venezuela, must be interpreted in light of principles of Venezuelan law.241 It is well established under that law that consent to arbitration must be clear and unequivocal.242 As will appear, it also contends that the plain language of Article 22 does not, in any event, provide for consent.\n\nResp. Mem. on Objections to Jurisdiction \u00b6 87.\n\nResp. Mem. on Objections to Jurisdiction \u00b6 88.\n\n234.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the question whether the Respondent consented to ICSID arbitration under Article 22 is a matter of international law: \"[b]y referring to consent under the ICSID Convention, Venezuelan law incorporates a *renvoi* to international law in relation to that question\".243 The question whether Venezuela consented to ICSID arbitration in its national law, the Claimants continue, is a matter to be determined within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and, thus, under international law, not Venezuelan law.244 In support of its contentions, each Party has referred the Tribunal to decisions of ICSID Tribunals.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 225.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 230.\n\n235.\n\nAn ICSID Tribunal reviewed the range of ICSID decisions on the issue of the governing law when consent is claimed to have been given in the national law. It provided this summary:\n\nFrom this review of ICSID case law, it results that in four cases, the question was not dealt with. In *SPP v. Egypt,* the tribunal decided to apply \u2018general principles of statutory interpretation,\u2019 \u2018taking into consideration relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations.\u2019 In *CSOB v. Slovak Republic,* the Tribunal took its decision only on the basis of the latter principles. In *Zhinvali v. Georgia,* it opted for domestic law \u2018subject to ultimate governance by international law\u2019.245\n\n*Cemex* \u00b6 76.\n\n236.\n\nIt commented that, in those cases, the States\u2019 (claimed) consent to arbitration \"was not contained in a treaty to be interpreted according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties... but in a unilateral offer made by that State in one form or another\".246 \"[T]hat very problem\", it continued, arose when the International Court of Justice interpreted unilateral declarations accepting its jurisdiction under Article 36(2) of its Statute. Those international instruments, according to the Court, \"must be interpreted by reference to international law\".247 That Tribunal said that it shared this analysis:248\n\nUnilateral acts by which a State consents to ICSID jurisdiction are standing offers made by a sovereign State to foreign investors under the ICSID Convention. Such offers could be incorporated into domestic legislation or not. But, whatever may be their form, they must be interpreted according to the ICSID Convention and to the principles of international law governing unilateral declarations of States.\n\n*Cemex* \u00b6 77.\n\n*Cemex* \u00b6 78.\n\n*Cemex* \u00b6 79\n\n237.\n\nThat Tribunal then considered \"the rules of interpretation\" as fixed by the International Court when interpreting unilateral declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court under Article 36(2) of its Statute.249 It concluded in these terms:250\n\n[T]he International Court of Justice interprets \u2018the relevant words of a declaration including a reservation contained therein in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State concerned.\u2019 The Court does so by starting with the text and, if the text is not clear, by giving due consideration to the context and examining the \u2018evidence regarding the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served.\u2019 Thus the intention of the declaring State must prevail.\n\n*Cemex* \u00b6\u00b6 83-87.\n\n*Cemex* \u00b6 87.\n\n**(3) The Text of Article 22**\n------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe task of the Tribunal in this case is to determine whether Venezuela in enacting Article 22 has given its consent to ICSID jurisdiction. Has it made a standing offer to foreign investors under the ICSID Convention? It is only when that question has been answered that the need to determine the extent of the consent might arise.\n\n239.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal now addresses the question just asked by reference to the words and structure of Article 22, its ordinary meaning, its object and purpose and its context, both immediate and long term, along with the other matters mentioned in paragraph 237 above.\n\n240.\n\nThe Claimants make their submissions relating to the words and structure and ordinary meaning of Article 22 by emphasising two different versions of the article. In the first, they address the following parts of the provision:\n\n... disputes to which are applicable the provisions of... the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides....\n\n241.\n\nIn relation to that text, the Claimants\u2019 first contention was that the express reference in Article 22 to the ICSID Convention is significant. Under the principle of effective interpretation, \"a fundamental principle of interpretation\", a legal text should be interpreted in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to every word in the text.251 Second, the Claimants emphasise the mandatory wording of the provision: certain categories of dispute \"shall be submitted to international arbitration\". That mandatory wording, they say, is to be contrasted with the permissive terms of the provision at the end of Article 22 relating to litigation in Venezuelan courts and of Article 23 about Venezuelan national courts and arbitral tribunals.252 The third argument relates to the final phrase of the provision as quoted above \u2014 the arbitration is to be carried out \"under the terms provided for in the respective treaty or agreement, should it so provide\".253 There is no question, according to the Claimants, that the ICSID Convention provides for arbitration, as well as the rules for conducting the arbitration. In answer to the Respondent\u2019s argument that \"if it so provides\" means \"if the respective treaty or agreement establishes, by its terms, that the dispute shall be submitted to international arbitration\", the Claimants contend that the essence of such an interpretation would be that Article 22 is pointless from start to finish.254 That argument returns to the effectiveness argument.\n\nCl.

Reply \u00b6 258 (citing Legal Expert Opinion of Enrique Urdaneta Fontiveros dated 28 November 2008, \u00b6 14).\n\n242.\n\nThe Respondent, in answer to the Claimants\u2019 first point about the principle of effective interpretation, contends that that principle does not permit the reading out of the statute words that are there or reading in words that are not there. The Claimants\u2019 reading would deny effect to the words \"if it so provides\". In the opinion of the Respondent, those words, to move to the second and third submissions made by the Claimants, state a condition which has to be satisfied and which has not been: Article 25 of the ICSID Convention requires that the Parties to the dispute consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre and Venezuela has not given that consent. Moreover, submits the Respondent, Article 22 does serve a useful purpose in making clear that Venezuela intended to honour all existing international commitments it had undertaken for international arbitration. In the context of \"the traditional Venezuelan hostility to international arbitration\" that affirmation was significant.255\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 36.\n\n243.\n\nBefore it considers those contextual matters to which the Parties gave considerable attention and the opinions of commentators on the Investment Law, including those said to have been involved in the preparation of the Law, the Tribunal sets out the second way in which the Claimants present Article 22 in support of their argument that, by that provision, Venezuela has consented to ICSID jurisdiction:\n\n... disputes to which are applicable the provisions of... the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration....\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 contention that Article 22 should be read in this abbreviated way is based in significant part on the use of the words \"treaty or agreement\" both at the beginning of the Article and towards its end, by contrast to the word \"Convention\" which is used twice in relation to identified texts, one of them being the ICSID Convention. The submission is that the words \"treaty or agreement\" are used as abstract categories, to be distinguished from the two specified Conventions, and, in the context of Article 22, do not include those two Conventions. Accordingly, the Claimants continue, in terms of the version of Article 22 set out above, disputes to which the provisions of the ICSID Convention apply \"shall be submitted to international arbitration\". There is no need to read on. Indeed it would be \"nonsense\" if the words \"if it so provides\" were \"supposed to reach back to modify the ICSID Convention. It would be foolish to ask whether the ICSID Convention provides for arbitration. That is what the ICSID Convention is all about\".256\n\nSee Tr. Day 1:87-89.\n\n245.\n\nIt is convenient to consider at this stage the Claimants\u2019 argument based on the abbreviated text (as set out in paragraph 243) \u2014 an argument, which was not made in the two earlier cases on Article 22 and that was mainly developed in the oral hearings.\n\n246.\n\nIt is true that the argument gains some support from the literal terms of Article 22 and its possible distinction between treaties and agreements on the one side and the two specified Conventions on the other. It does, however, face what, in the opinion of the Tribunal, is an insurmountable hurdle when the provisions of those two Conventions dealing with disputes are considered. The MIGA Convention establishes procedures for the settlement of four different types of disputes:257\n\na. questions of interpretation and application of the Convention arising between the Agency and a member State or between members: they are to be decided by the Board of the Agency, with a right of appeal by any member to the Council of the Agency (Article 56);\n\nb. disputes arising under a contract of guarantee or reinsurance between the Agency and the other Party: they are to be submitted to final arbitration in accordance with the rules in the contract of guarantee or reinsurance (Article 58);\n\nc. disputes between the Agency as subrogee of an investor and a member: they are to be settled in accordance with the procedure laid down either in Annex II to the Convention or in an agreement between the Agency and the member for an alternative method or methods of dispute settlement. Annex II provides for negotiation, and, if it fails, for arbitration on the submission of either party, or for conciliation if they agree; the conciliation and arbitration processes are regulated in some detail, by reference to the parallel provisions in the ICSID Convention (Article 57(b)); and\n\nd. any dispute other than those in (a), (b) and (c) above between the Agency and a member or former member (or an agency thereof): they are also to be settled in accordance with Annex II (Article 57(a)).\n\nEx. R-62, Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, October 11, 1985, 24 I.L.M. 1605 (1985).\n\n247.\n\nThe detail of those processes, including the use of arbitration in some cases but not in others, indicates plainly that \"disputes to which are applicable the provisions of the [MIGA] Convention... shall be submitted to international arbitration\" only \"according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement [here the MIGA Convention]\".258 That final phrase, omitted in the Claimants\u2019 abbreviated version, cannot be ignored in considering the reference to that Convention in Article 22. Those words are not to be read out of the text.\n\nEx. C-l and Ex. 12, Investment Law, Art. 22 (emphasis added).\n\n248.\n\nThe same is true when the provisions for the settlement of disputes included in the ICSID Convention are considered. The first point is that investment disputes to which are applicable the provisions of the Convention may be submitted to conciliation under its Chapter III rather than to arbitration under Chapter IV. Second, \"[a]ny dispute arising between Contracting States concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention which is not settled by negotiation shall be referred to the International Court of Justice by any party to the dispute unless the States concerned agree to another method of settlement\"259. As with the provisions of the MIGA Convention, those provisions make it clear that it is not enough, as the abbreviated version of Article 22 would have it, to say that \"disputes to which are applicable the provisions of... [the ICSID Convention] shall be submitted to international arbitration. The submission has to be \u2018according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement [here the ICSID Convention, Chapter IV]\"\u2019.\n\nICSID Convention, Art. 64.\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 argument based on the abbreviated version of Article 22 must therefore fail.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly returns to the fuller version of Article 22 set out in paragraph 225 above on which the Parties placed their primary emphasis. As already indicated, in addressing the meaning of that text, they gave considerable attention to the context, especially Venezuela\u2019s attitude to international arbitration over the last 100 or more years and more recently.\n\n251.\n\nThe most immediate context to the parts of Article 22 being considered is the final phrase of that provision and Article 23 and Article 1. The final phrase saves the existing rights of the investor or the State to bring proceedings under Venezuelan Law. Article 23 similarly recognises the right of the investor to submit a dispute arising in connection with the application of the Law, once it has exhausted administrative remedies, to national courts or arbitral tribunals of Venezuela, that is to say to bring proceedings unilaterally. The clear grant or recognition of those unilateral powers to initiate proceedings under national law provides a sharp contrast to the provisions of Article 22 relating to international arbitration, according to the Respondent. The Claimants comment in respect of Article 23 that it uses the permissive word may as opposed to the mandatory shall that is used in Article 22.260 The reply of the Respondent is that this is a misreading of Article 23, which provides for national, not international, arbitration at the option of the investor; the permissive \"may\" becomes mandatory once the investor exercises that option.261\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 252.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 31, fh. 71.\n\n252.\n\nIt is the Claimants who emphasise Article 1 of the Investment Law:\n\nThis Decree-Law is intended to provide investments and investors, both domestic and foreign, with a stable and predictable legal framework whereby the former and the latter may work in a secure environment, by regulating the actions of the State towards these investments and investors so as to bring about the increase, diversification and harmonic complementarity of investments in favour of the national development goals.262\n\nArticle 22, they submit, must be interpreted with the purpose of realising the goals, expressed in Article 1, of promoting and protecting foreign investment.263 The Respondent submits that it is the final phrase of Article 1, with its emphasis on advancing the objective of national development, which expresses the purpose of the Investment Law. Further, such a purposive provision does not itself have substantive effect.264\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 267.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 267-68.\n\nSee Tr. Day 2:366.\n\n253.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 submissions on the external context, beyond the terms of the Investment Law itself, addressed traditional and more recent Venezuelan attitudes toward arbitration, both national and international, and the particular background to the enactment of the Investment Law. In respect of that last matter, they gave close attention to the opinions of a number of commentators including some said by the Claimants to be the drafters, or involved in the drafting, of the Law. The Tribunal has not found this material helpful. It does not lead to a clear result.265 What is critical for the Tribunal is the wording of Article 22 read in the immediate context in accordance with accepted principles of interpretation which appear to be the same in international law and Venezuelan law.266\n\nWith respect to the history of the drafting of the Investment Law and, in particular, the lack of clarity that Venezuela, in adopting Article 22, intended to give its consent to ICSID arbitration in the absence of a bilateral investment treaty, *etc., see* *Mobil* \u00b6 131 (\"[T]he Tribunal cannot draw from this general evolution in favour of BITs the conclusion that Venezuela, in adopting Article 22, intended to give in advance its consent to ICSID arbitration in the absence of such BITs\".).\n\n*See, e.g.,* Resp. Rej. \u00b6 25 (stating that the Investment Law \"bears no resemblance to any of the other consents to arbitration in any of Venezuela\u2019s treaties or to the model ICSID clauses for consent to arbitration.\").\n\n254.\n\nAgainst that background, the Tribunal returns to the terms of Article 22 to determine their meaning. It begins with the difference between the Parties about the question whether the consent of Venezuela must be stated clearly or unequivocally or the provision is to be interpreted objectively and in good faith. Given that States are subject to binding third party dispute settlement procedures only if they so consent and, given the weight of authority referred to earlier, particularly as found in decisions of the International Court of Justice and in the particular ICSID context, the Tribunal considers that its approach should be cautious. In the words of the International Court of Justice in considering the very first challenge made to its jurisdiction, the consent must be \"voluntary and indisputable\",267 and in the words of both ICSID tribunals \"clear and unambiguous\".268 The necessary consent is not to be presumed. It must be clearly demonstrated. As will be seen, the difference on this issue may not be significant.\n\n*See supra* fh. 238.\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction dated 8 February 2005, \u00b6 198 (\"It is a well-established principle, both in domestic and international law, that [an agreement to arbitrate] should be clear and unambiguous\".). *See also* *Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award dated 8 December 2008, \u00b6 167.\n\n255.\n\nThat also appears to be the case with the Parties\u2019 initially different positions on the applicable law. By the end, they were in broad agreement that the meaning of Article 22 was to be determined by considering its terms in context and in the light of their purpose.269 The Tribunal is of the same opinion. No significant difference is to be seen between Venezuelan law as found in Article 4 of the Civil Code and decisions of the Supreme Court of Venezuela, the law reflected in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the statements to be found in relevant decisions of international courts and tribunals. They all call for particular attention to be given to the text, along with the other matters. The question remains: did Venezuela in Article 22 of the Law give its consent to international arbitration under ICSID?\n\n*See, e.g.,* Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 246-47; Resp. Rej., \u00b6 23, &. 55; Tr. Day 14:3797:12-16 (Claimants\u2019 Counsel); Tr. Day 14:3919-20 (Respondent\u2019s Counsel).\n\n256.\n\nSo far as the text is concerned, the Respondent, it will be recalled, gave particular weight to the phrase \"according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides\". The final four words, it said, state a condition. The treaty \u2014 in this case the ICSID Convention \u2014 does not, according to the Respondent, itself \"provide\" for international arbitration. On the contrary, in its Article 25, the ICSID Convention expressly requires that the State consent to jurisdiction. That condition has not been satisfied. For the Claimants, that contention was answered by the fact that ICSID does provide for international arbitration: it regulates all the necessary elements.\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that those four words \u2014 if it [the treaty or agreement] so provides [should it so provide] \u2014 present the essential issue to be determined. They do state a condition \u2014 as indeed the Claimants\u2019 expert on Venezuelan law accepted. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, that condition has not been satisfied. It is not enough, as the Claimants contend, that the ICSID Convention provides for international arbitration. That treaty must itself manifest Venezuela\u2019s consent to arbitration; but that treaty does not do that, as its Article 25 and preamble make clear. The ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 22, and especially of the condition, leads the Tribunal to the conclusion that Venezuela does not by that means consent to international arbitration under the ICSID Convention. Other considerations support that conclusion.\n\n258.\n\nIf the Claimants\u2019 position was correct, it would follow that, if Venezuela in a future investment treaty were to accept the possibility of international arbitration but not to consent to it in that treaty, the Investment Law, by way of Article 22, would provide for that consent notwithstanding the deliberate choice of the State Parties to the treaty and the absence of reciprocity that that reading would introduce. That cannot be correct. A further possible difficulty with the Claimants\u2019 reading of Article 22 is that the consent of the investor would also apparently not be required: the State would have a unilateral right to initiate the process against the investor and the investment dispute \"shall be submitted to international arbitration\", notwithstanding the plain terms of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.270 If that is not a direct consequence of the \"mandatory\" reading, then Article 22 leaves the investor with an option.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 32.\n\n259.\n\nThe Claimants, it will be recalled, invoke the principle of the effective interpretation of treaties: a reason and meaning is to be attributed to every word in the text. In their view, the Respondent\u2019s interpretation would deprive the reference to ICSID in Article 22 of all effect. The Respondent submits, to the contrary, that the Claimants\u2019 proposed interpretation would deprive the expression \"if it so provides\", also included in Article 22, of all effect. The principle of effective interpretation does not enable a court or tribunal to rewrite the provision that it is interpreting, in particular, by writing words out of the text. The Respondent also submits that, on its reading of Article 22, the reference to ICSID, along with the reference to the other treaties and agreements, does have a useful purpose: it made it clear that Venezuela intended to honour all existing international commitments that it had undertaken for international arbitration, including those in particular BITs in which it plainly had already accepted that investors had the option to bring international arbitration proceedings against it. In the context of the traditional Venezuelan hostility to international arbitration, that affirmation, it says, was significant.271 The Respondent points out that other provisions of the Investment Law, relating to sectors of economic activity reserved by law to the State or to Venezuelan investors, and the law and policy regulating the entry and stay of foreigners and labour legislation,272 are not necessary as a matter of Venezuelan law: they do no more than replicate provisions of the constitution and other laws, and appear in a general law which gives a more comprehensive sense of the law applying to investments made by national investors and foreign investors. The Claimants\u2019 expert agreed.273 There is the further consideration, to quote from the ICSID decision in the *Biwater Gauff* case, that a provision such as Article 22 may have some effect by clearing the way for the State to conclude specific types of dispute resolution agreements without internal issues such as *ultra vires* arising and as such it provides a sense of certainty for investors.274\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 36.\n\n*See* Ex. C-l and Ex. R-12, Investment Law, Arts. 7 and 14.\n\nTr. Day 9:2365-66.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award dated 24 July 2008, \u00b6 331.\n\n260.\n\nGiven its broad scope and general nature, the 1999 Decree is not, in the opinion of the Tribunal, the kind of law to every provision of which distinct legal effect is necessarily to be given. In that respect it differs from legal instruments with a single purpose such as declarations accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice under Article 36(2) of its Statute. Accordingly, on the matter of effective interpretation, the Tribunal agrees with the contentions made by the Respondent.\n\n261.\n\nAs the Tribunal has already indicated, the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 22 leads it strongly to the conclusion that Venezuela has not consented to ICSID jurisdiction by enacting that provision. The immediate context provided by the proviso to Article 22, by other provisions of the Investment Law, particularly Article 23, point in the same direction. The broader context, along with the commentaries, does not affect that conclusion. Nor do the contentions based on the principle of effective interpretation; if anything that principle supports the conclusion.\n\n262.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that it does not have jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Investment Law. It follows that it need not consider the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over ConocoPhillips Company\u2019s claims on the basis that ConocoPhillips Company is not an \"international investor\" under Article 22 of the Law.\n\n263.\n\nAnother consequence of the ruling that Venezuela by way of Article 22 does not consent to international arbitration is that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claim made by ConocoPhillips Company based on its loss of future tax credits. It will be recalled that only ConocoPhillips Company and not the Dutch companies made that claim and that ConocoPhillips Company is not able to claim under the Dutch BIT. In any event, after the present Tribunal has issued its Award, ConocoPhillips Company will be at liberty to consider any measure which Venezuela may adopt with respect to any element of the Award that has a bearing on US tax credits of ConocoPhillips Company and then decide whether such measures give rise to any claim before an appropriate forum.\n\n**C. Article 9 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty Between the Netherlands and Venezuela**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nArticle 9, paragraphs (1), (3), (4) and (5) of the Treaty provide as follows:\n\n1. Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter, shall at the request of the national concerned be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965.\n\n3. The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of obligations has caused damages to the national concerned, and, if such is the case, the amount of compensation.\n\n4. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in Paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n5. The arbitral award shall be based on:\n\n- the law of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n- the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant Agreements between the Contacting Parties;\n\n- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments;\n\n- the general principles of international law; and\n\n- such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties to the dispute.\n\n265.\n\nThe three Dutch claimants contend that Venezuela has consented to ICSID arbitration under Article 9(1) in respect of their claims:\n\n(1) CPZ, CPH and CGP are Dutch nationals within the definition of \"nationals\" in Article 1(b) of the BIT:\n\n[t]he term \"nationals\" shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party... (ii) legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party.\n\n(2) The dispute concerns qualifying investments of the three companies in Venezuela within the meaning of Article 1(a) and 9(1). \"Investments\" include \"rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interest in companies and joint ventures\".\n\n(3) A dispute in relation to an investment as defined in Article 9(1) is present here. The claims in the arbitration concern Venezuela\u2019s obligation under the Treaty and international law in relation to the investments of CPZ, CPH and CPB in the Venezuelan hydrocarbons sector.275\n\nSee Cl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 284-88.\n\n266.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the three companies cannot gain access to ICSID under the Dutch Treaty for two reasons:\n\n(1) the claimants are \"corporations of convenience\" created in anticipation of litigation against the Respondent for the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID; and\n\n(2) the investments relied on by CPH and CGP are indirect investments and fall outside the definition of an investment, which does not extend to investments in Venezuela owned or controlled indirectly by Dutch nationals through one or more intermediaries.276\n\n*See* Resp. Mem. on Objections to Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 136-181.\n\n267.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that, even if those arguments do not succeed, several of the claims would fail because, at the time the particular measure that was at the basis of the claim was taken, the Dutch claimants were not in existence or had not been inserted into the corporate chain of ownership.277 It will be seen that the facts relating to this argument and the argument about \"corporations of convenience\" overlap.\n\n*See* Resp. C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 124-45.\n\n**(1) \"Corporations of Convenience\"**\n-------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe Respondent cites a number of ICSID decisions in support of its argument that, notwithstanding that the claimants in those cases technically met the nationality requirements of the relevant treaties, the tribunals refused, or considered refusing, the claims. The basis for such refusals was, in the Respondent\u2019s terms, abuse of the corporate form and blatant treaty or forum shopping, which should not be condoned. On the facts, it says that ConocoPhillips had no valid business purpose for this corporate restructuring and the Tribunal should find that it has no jurisdiction under the BIT.\n\n269.\n\nThe Claimants have two responses. The first relates to the facts, including the timing of the restructuring of their investments in Venezuela which, they say, occurred before the dispute arose. They made those investments before the changes were made in the tax law and before the investments were confiscated. Second, there is no principle of law, they contend, which precludes a corporation from altering its form, by creating subsidiaries or reincorporating to benefit from the protection of another country\u2019s laws.278\n\nCl. Reply Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 294-97.\n\n270.\n\nThat last contention of the Claimants is supported, in their view, by the relevant part of the definition of \"nationals\" \u2014 they are \"legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party [the Netherlands]\". The Parties in determining the personal scope of the BIT did not include any additional element of control, as provided in subparagraph (iii) of the definition of nationals for legal persons constituted under the law of a third State, a test which is elaborated in the Protocol to the Treaty but only in respect of that specific part of the definition of a national.279\n\n*See* Ex. C-2, Treaty, Art. 1 (b)(ii).\n\n271.\n\nFour of the cases cited by the Parties share two significant features. The first is that the definition, or its relevant part, of \"investors\", \"legal persons\" and \"companies\" is essentially to the same effect as the definition of nationals in Article 1 (b)(ii) of the BIT:280\n\na. an \"investor\" includes an entity established in the territory of the Ukraine in conformity with its laws and regulations.281\n\nb. \"nationals\" include legal persons constituted in accordance with the law of that Contracting Party...,282\n\nc. \"investor\" includes \"legal entities incorporated or constituted in accordance with Israel\u2019s laws and having their permanent seat in the territory of the State of Israel.283\n\nd. definition applicable in this case, in the *Mobil* case.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 265\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e8s v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction dated 29 April, 2004 (considering the Lithuania-Ukraine bilateral investment treaty).\n\n*Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v. Republic of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction dated 21 October 2005 (considering the Netherlands-Bolivia bilateral investment treaty).\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award dated 15 April 2009 (considering the Czech Republic-Israel bilateral investment treaty).\n\n272.\n\nThe second significant feature is that, in those cases, the tribunals deciding the challenges to jurisdiction did not dismiss the challenges simply on the basis that those formal requirements were met \u2014 as they were, and, as the Respondent accepts, they were here.284 The tribunals went on to consider whether the objection to jurisdiction should be upheld on a distinct broader basis. In the third case, the tribunal did in fact uphold that challenge. In another case, *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. (\"Aucoven\") v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,*285 which turned on the definition of \"national of another Contracting Party State\" in Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention itself, the tribunal similarly did not limit itself to the parties\u2019 definition of foreign control in their concession agreement \u2014 the expression used in Article 25(2)(b). While accepting that it could not discard the criterion which the parties had established, it did qualify that proposition in the event that the criterion proved \"unreasonable\".286 It then considered matters of fact similar to those considered in the other four cases mentioned and those which are taken up later in this Decision.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 104.\n\n*Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. (\"Aucoven \") v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5, Decision on Jurisdiction dated 27 September 2001.\n\n*Aucoven* \u00b6 120.\n\n273.\n\nThe principal reason that tribunals have given for not treating compliance with formal or technical requirements as being sufficient is to avoid the misuse of power conferred by law. The *Mobil* tribunal observed that \"in all systems of law, whether domestic or international, there are concepts framed in order to avoid misuse of the law\".287 It referred to good faith, *d\u00e9tournement de pouvoir* and abuse of right. In support of that proposition, it referred to decisions of the International Court of Justice, the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organisation, other international tribunals and other ICSID tribunals.288 A decision related those broad principles to the ICSID process itself:289\n\nThe Tribunal is concerned here with *the international principle of good faith as applied to the international arbitration mechanism of ICSID.* The Tribunal has to prevent an abuse of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention, in ensuring that only investments that are made in compliance with the international principle of good faith and do not attempt to misuse the system are protected.\n\n*Mobil* \u00b6169.\n\n*See* *Mobil* \u00b6\u00b6 169-76. *See also* *Case Concerning Certain Questions in Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France),* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, 4 June 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 145-48.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award dated 15 April 2009, \u00b6 113 (emphasis in the original). *See also Tokios Tokel\u00e8s v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Dissenting Opinion of Prosper Weil dated 29 April 2004, \u00b6 25.\n\n274.\n\nIt may be observed that, apart from the ICSID cases, the authorities cited concern claims that States have abused their powers or acted in bad faith. In the present context, the doctrine is being invoked in relation to the actions of a corporate body, not of a State, but it is a corporate body seeking to make use of a procedure of an international character to settle a dispute with a State, set up by States which drafted, concluded and accepted the Convention. That Convention has as its purpose to establish a \"Centre... to provide facilities for conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States in accordance with the provisions of the Convention\".290 There is jurisdiction only if the parties to the dispute have each consented and throughout the process each is treated on an equal footing, as indeed the principles of due process and natural justice require. That equality of position in the present context is, in this Tribunal\u2019s view, a further factor supporting the growing body of decisions placing some limits on the investor\u2019s choice of corporate form, even if it complies with the relevant technical definition in the treaty text.\n\nICSID Convention, Art. 1(2).\n\n275.\n\nWhether those limits have been breached must turn on a close examination of all of the circumstances of the case, circumstances to which the parties in this arbitration have given particular attention. The Tribunal now turns to that examination. It will do that bearing in mind how rarely courts and tribunals have held that a good faith or other related standard is breached. The standard is a high one.\n\n276.\n\nThe facts relating to the incorporation of the Dutch companies and their placing in the chain of ownership of the projects appear earlier in this Decision. In brief:\n\na. The three projects began in the 1990s. The Petrozuata and Hamaca projects were set up through US companies in 1995 and 1997 and, although the Corocoro project was undertaken initially in 1996 through a Dutch company (Conoco Venezuela BV), those interests were transferred three years later to a Venezuelan company (Conoco Venezuela CA).\n\nb. The Dutch companies were incorporated and took interests in the projects as follows:\n\n\u2022 CPZ was incorporated on 26 July 2005 and the relevant ownership interest was transferred to it on 27 July 2005;291\n\n\u2022 CGP was incorporated on 26 July 2005 and the relevant ownership interest was transferred to it on 11 August 2005;292 and\n\n\u2022 CPH was incorporated on 17 July 2006 and the relevant ownership interest was transferred to it on 22 September 2006.293\n\nc. The record includes notifications to the Venezuelan Mercantile Registry in respect of CPZ on 3 November 2005294 and on 9 January 2007,295 and to PdVSA on 25 September 2006;296 and in respect of CGP on 11 January 2007.297\n\nResp. Mem. on Objections to Jurisdiction, p. 40. On 11 August 2005, a subsidiary of CPZ, through which CPZ owned its interest in Petrozuata, transferred its interest in Conoco Venezuela Holding C.A. to CPZ. The effect was to remove Conoco Venezuela Holding, C.A. from the chain of ownership. Subsequently, CPZ indirectly owned a 50.1 percent stake in Petrozuata through Conoco Venezuela Holding, C.A., a Venezuelan company. *See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 138-140.\n\nResp.

C-36, *supra* at fh. 198. *See also* Ex. C-30 and C-30A, Letter from A. Roy Lyons, President, ConocoPhillips Latin America to Dr Bernard Mommer, Vice Minister of Hydrocarbons dated 29 November 2006.\n\n278.\n\nAgainst that chronology and bearing in mind the matters weighed by other tribunals considering objections to jurisdiction made on the basis of \"treaty abuse\", this Tribunal makes a number of observations. The first is that the transfers of ownership in 2005 and 2006 did not attempt to transfer any right or claim arising under ICSID or a BIT from one owner to another. Indeed, at the time of the transfers, ConocoPhillips had withdrawn its only claim of breach and had done that in the clearest of terms. It was not until May 2006 that the first of the actions, which were later to be the subject of the letters from ConocoPhillips notifying the Venezuelan government of a dispute, was taken. The Tribunal later considers the significance of the date of that measure and of 29 August 2006 for the CPH claim.\n\n279.\n\nIt is the case, to turn to a second matter, that the only business purpose of the restructuring, as acknowledged by the Claimants\u2019 principal witness on this matter, was to be able to have access to ICSID proceedings.299 But as against that, as already noted, no claim had been made at the time of the restructuring and, subject to the qualification made in respect of the claims by CPH about the two measures taken in 2006, none was in prospect at the times of the restructurings.\n\nTr. Day 3:552:4-9 (Goff).\n\n280.\n\nOne major factor indicates that ConocoPhillips wished to continue to carry out the projects and that proceedings under the BIT were not in prospect at that time. That factor, a very weighty one in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, is ConocoPhillips\u2019 continuing expenditure on the projects. According to its evidence, which was not challenged, ConocoPhillips invested approximately U.S.$ 434 million on the three projects after the decision to restructure was made in mid-2OO5.300 The total ConocoPhillips\u2019 expenditure after the enactment of the Investment Law was U.S.$ 5.3 billion.301 For the Tribunal, this continued substantial involvement in the development and operation of the projects is evidence telling strongly against any finding of treaty abuse.\n\nTr. Day 14:3817:11-16 (Claimants\u2019 Counsel).\n\nTr. Day 14:3817:21-22 (Claimants\u2019 Counsel).\n\n281.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects that challenge to jurisdiction.\n\n**(2) Indirect Investment**\n---------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThe Respondent contends that because two of the Dutch companies \u2014 CPH and CGP \u2014 have only indirect investments held through subsidiaries, their claims under the Treaty must be dismissed. The Respondent points out that several bilateral investment treaties concluded by both Venezuela and the Netherlands expressly cover both direct and indirect investments, language not used in the Netherlands-Venezuelan BIT. To read the present non-express BIT wording as covering indirect investments would make that careful elaboration unnecessary and ignore the limit arising from the ordinary meaning of the words of the Treaty, taken in light of its object and purpose.302\n\nResp. Mem. on Objections to Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 172-81.\n\n283.\n\nThe Claimants invoke \"the plain language of Article 1 of the Treaty [which] contains the broadest definition of investment possible: every kind of investment\".303 Both the Respondent and the Claimants refer in support of their contentions, in addition to other treaty practice, to decisions of other ICSID tribunals.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 361.\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal remarks in respect of treaty practice that this demonstrates that there is no single way of drafting definitions. Different formulations may have precisely the same effect. Drafting practice varies. While, as the Respondent notes, some of the Dutch bilateral investment treaties use a different formula, its model bilateral investment treaty, along with very many others, uses exactly the wording to be found in the treaty with Venezuela. The one case which is directly in point \u2014 *Fedax \u2014* also supports the Claimants\u2019 \"plain meaning\".304\n\n*Fedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction dated 11 July 1997.\n\n285.\n\nFor the Tribunal the words of the definition are clear beyond question. They are written in broad terms, as indeed the Respondent accepts.305 In the words of Vattel, there is no need to interpret that which has no need of interpretation.306\n\nResp. Mem. on Objections to Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 174, 180.\n\nEmer de Vattel, *Le Droit des Gens, ou Principes de la Loi Naturelle* (1758) \u00b6 263.\n\n286.\n\nAccordingly, this objection to jurisdiction in respect of the claims of CPH and CGP fails.\n\n**(3) Ratione Temporis**\n------------------------\n\n287.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claims made by CPH in respect of the extraction tax that was enacted in May 2006 and the amendment to the Income Tax Law enacted in August 2006 before that company was inserted in September into the corporate chain relating to the Hamaca project. The Claimants and CPH in particular do not challenge the principle that the Dutch companies have no claims in respect of actions taken by Venezuela before they had acquired the relevant interest.\n\n288.\n\nThe law increasing the extraction tax to 33% percent came into force on 24 May 2006 and, accordingly, CPH can make no claim in respect of it.\n\n289.\n\nWhile the income tax increase was enacted before CPH was inserted into the chain of ownership in the following month, September 2006, the increase did not come into effect until 1 January 2007.307 Which date is decisive? The date of the enactment of the law providing for the increase or the date it took effect in the law? In principle, the Tribunal considers that a breach of obligation does not occur until the law in issue is actually applied in breach of that obligation and that cannot happen before the law in question is in force.308 In this particular context the relevant date was 1 January 2007, some months after CPH acquired its ownership interest. Accordingly the Respondent\u2019s objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over CPH\u2019s claim based on the increase in income tax must be rejected.\n\nTr.

Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n290.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the Tribunal decides that:\n\na. It does not have jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Investment Law and that accordingly the claims by ConocoPhillips Company are dismissed; and\n\nb. It has jurisdiction under Article 9 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty over:\n\ni. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV, ConocoPhilips Hamaca BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of (1) the increase in the income tax rate which came into effect on 1 January 2007 and (2) the expropriation or migration; and\n\nii. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of the increase in the extraction tax in effect from 24 May 2006.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that one consequence of its decision above relating to Article 22 of the Investment Law is that it does not have jurisdiction over the claim by ConocoPhillips Company based on its loss of future tax credits.309\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 263.\n\n**VII. MERITS**\n---------------\n\n**A. Claims for Breach of the Obligation of Fair and EquitableTreatment: Articles 3 and 4 of the Netherlands-Venezuela Treaty**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Claimants base their claims of breaches by the Respondent of its obligation to accord their investments fair and equitable treatment on the requirements to that effect included in the Investment Law and the Treaty. Since the Tribunal has held that it has no jurisdiction over the claims brought under the Investment Law, this section of the Decision is concerned only with the obligations owed to the Dutch companies and arising under the Treaty.\n\n292.\n\nArticle 3 of the Treaty places an obligation on each Contracting Party to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party. It is in these terms:310\n\n(1) Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by arbitrary or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.\n\n(2) More particularly, each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full physical security and protection which in any case shall not be less than that accorded either to investments of its own nationals or to investments of nationals of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the national concerned.\n\n(3) If a Contracting Party has accorded special advantages to nationals of any third State by virtue of agreements establishing customs unions, economic unions, monetary unions or similar institutions, or on the basis of interim agreements leading to such unions or institutions, that Contracting Party shall not be obliged to accord such advantages to nationals of the other Contracting Party.\n\n(4) Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to the treatment of investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party. If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contacting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such regulation shall to the extent that it is more favourable prevail over the present Agreement.\n\nIn a Protocol to the Treaty signed on the same day as the Treaty as \"an integral part\" of it, the Contracting Parties agreed to the following:311\n\n2. Ad Article 3(1):\n\nThe Contracting Parties agree that the treatment of investments shall be considered to be fair and equitable as mentioned in Article 3, paragraph 1, if it conforms to the treatment accorded to investments of their own nationals, or to investments of nationals of any third State, whichever is more favorable to the national concerned, as well as to the minimum standard for the treatment of foreign nationals under international law.\n\nEx. C-2 and Ex. R-13, Treaty, Art. 3.\n\n*Id.* Protocol, Section 2 (Ad Article 3(1)).\n\n293.\n\nThat detailed specification of the fair and equitable treatment standard constitutes one departure from the model Netherlands BIT, a model followed in scores of other Dutch treaties. A second departure is the use of the word \"arbitrary\" instead of \"unreasonable\" in the second limb of Article 3(1): the obligation not to impair, by arbitrary or discriminatory measures, the operation... of the investments by the nationals of the other Party. There is also a third departure, namely, the specification of the applicable law included in paragraph (5) of Article 9 on applicable law beginning with the law of the Contracting Party concerned, an addition to the model. It does not appear to have a particular significance in this case, but it is to be related to the general position of Venezuela in the negotiation of the BIT, discussed in the next paragraph.\n\n294.\n\nThe reporting by both Contracting Parties to their legislatures, when seeking approval of the ratification of the Treaty, makes it clear that these changes were made at the request of the Venezuelan negotiators and to respond to their concerns. The letter from the Netherlands\u2019 Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Dutch Parliament explained that:312\n\nThe Venezuelan delegation had problems with the [usual] formulation of [the general article for the treatment of investors]. Because the carrying out of obligations under this article can also be the subject of disagreements between an investor and a host country which can be presented for international arbitration, the Venezuelan delegation feared that under the wording of this article the scope of the international arbitration provision was not narrow enough and thus opened the possibilities for misuse. To appease these objections, the word \u2018arbitrary\u2019 has been substituted for \u2018unreasonable\u2019. Also, a protocol-text (section 2) has been laid down in which the basic treatment is further defined as containing either national treatment, or most-favored-nation treatment, depending on which of the two treatments is the most favorable for the investor. Apart from that, the treatment must fulfill the minimum standard under international law for the treatment of foreigners.\n\nThe letter goes on to explain that the paragraph about applicable law was added in response to \"fundamental objections\" initially presented by Venezuela to international arbitration, based on the Calvo doctrine. The agreed text \"can be seen as a break-through\".313 The Explanatory Statement to the Venezuelan Congress is to the same effect:\n\nTreatment not inferior to the minimum required by International Law for the treatment of foreign nationals. This is, by definition, a pre-existing obligation of the Parties, independently of the Agreement. Its express inclusion in the Protocol which is an integral part of the Agreement has, however, a great importance because it specifies expressions such as \u2018fair and equitable treatment,\u2019 and thus limits the discretion of eventual arbitrators when examining the behaviour of any of the Parties.314\n\nEx.

R-229, Explanatory Statement for the Dutch Treaty presented to the Congress of the Republic of Venezuela, dated November 19, 1991.\n\n**(2) The Relationship between Articles 3 and 4**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nThe claims based on Article 3 were at first put in terms of what the Claimants saw as guarantees of fiscal stability given by the Respondent in respect of their investments in the three projects. Later, as will appear, the submissions emphasised what the Claimants saw as breaches by the Respondent of their reasonable or legitimate expectations based on regulatory frameworks, breaches caused by various increases in income tax and royalties or extraction tax.\n\n296.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the factual and legal bases of the contentions advanced by the Claimants under Article 3. The Respondent also submits that, as a matter of interpretation of the BIT, the various changes in tax and royalty rates that it introduced do not fall within the scope of Article 3; rather they are to be assessed by reference to Article 4. As a matter of convenience and logic that submission is considered first.\n\n**(3) The Effect of Article 4**\n-------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the \"fair and equitable\" treatment obligation imposed by Article 3 of the Dutch Treaty does not apply to tax and fiscal measures. Article 4, it says, sets out a specific standard of treatment with respect to tax and fiscal measures.315\n\nArticle 4 reads as follows:\n\nWith respect to taxes, fees, charges, and to fiscal deductions and exemptions, each Contracting Party shall accord to nationals of the other Contracting Party with respect to their investments in its territory treatment not less favourable than that accorded to its own nationals or to those of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the nationals concerned. For this purpose, however, there shall not be taken into account any special fiscal advantages accorded by that Party:\n\na) under an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation; or\n\nb) by virtue of its participation in a customs union, economic union, or similar institutions; or\n\nc) on the basis of reciprocity with a third State.\n\nUnder those express terms, the Respondent\u2019s argument continues, \"foreign investors in Venezuela are entitled to be treated in the same manner as Venezuelan nationals and nationals of third States\".316 So long as its tax and fiscal measures were applied to the Dutch companies in a non-discriminatory manner, which is undisputed in this case, there is no violation of its obligations under the Treaty in relation to such measures.317\n\nResp. C-Mem. \u00b6 217.\n\nResp. C-Mem. \u00b6 218.\n\nResp. C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 217-18.\n\n298.\n\nThe Claimants reply that the Respondent is not relieved of liability by Article 4 of the Treaty. It is not, they contend, a tax \"carve-out\" provision. The Respondent, they continue, misconstrues the clear language of Article 4 to suggest that the Dutch Claimants may not bring a fair and equitable treatment claim with respect to any tax and fiscal measures under the Treaty. According to the Claimants, Article 4 simply states that a foreign investor cannot bring a claim for discrimination under either the national treatment or most favoured nation (MFN) treatment standards due to more favourable provisions in tax treaties or economic unions that either the Netherlands or Venezuela has entered into with third States.318\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 472-5.\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the special treatment of tax and fiscal measures in the Dutch Treaty is consistent with the overwhelming authority discussed in its Counter-Memorial, recognising that taxation is a quintessential sovereign right. It is not unusual, according to the Respondent, for investment treaties to exclude taxation matters from the fair and equitable treatment standard. It cites a number of examples and tribunal rulings applying provisions making such exclusions.\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimants respond that a true tax carve-out provision, as in issue in a number of those cases, would exempt tax measures from the protection afforded by a treaty in terms such as the following included in Article X of the US-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty:319\n\n(1) With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investments of nationals and companies of the other Party.\n\n(2) Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Articles VI and VII [concerning dispute settlement], shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following: (a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III; (b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or (c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment Agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VI(1) (a) or (b), to the extent that they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable period of time.\n\nThat provision was in issue in *Duke Energy,* one of the cases discussed by the Parties.320\n\nCl.

Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award dated August 18, 2008 at \u00b6\u00b6 171-89).\n\n**(4) The Ordinary Meanings and Purposes of Article 3 and Article 4**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with the ordinary meanings of the terms of Article 3 and Article 4. It gives particular attention to the differences between them. Article 3 is the more general in scope being concerned with the \"treatment of investments\"; Article 4 deals with more specific matters: \"taxes, fees, charges, and... fiscal deductions and exemptions\".\n\n302.\n\nParagraph (1) of Article 3 begins by requiring each Contracting Party to \"ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party\". That obligation is the subject of the Protocol to the Agreement in which the Contracting Parties agree that the treatment of investments shall be considered to be fair and equitable if the treatment conforms to national treatment and to MFN treatment, as well as to the minimum standard for the treatment of foreign nationals under international law. Paragraph (2) of Article 3 \"more particularly\" requires that such investments be accorded full physical security and protection which is not to be less than that accorded on a national or MFN basis. Paragraph (3) provides for exceptions to the MFN treatment obligation, the details of which the Tribunal considers later. Finally, paragraph (4) of Article 3 requires compliance with any other obligations a Contracting Party may have with regard to the treatment of investments of nationals of the other Party, if those obligations require treatment more favourable than that provided in the Treaty. Like the Parties, the Tribunal does not see that final paragraph as relevant in this case.\n\n303.\n\nArticle 4 requires each Contracting Party \"with respect to taxes, fees, charges, and to fiscal deductions and exemptions\" to accord the nationals of the other Contracting Party national or MFN treatment; however, by contrast to Article 3, it says nothing about \"fair and equitable treatment\". That more specific obligation is subject to three particular exceptions, two of which are not included in Article 3(3) and which are also considered later.\n\n304.\n\nTo summarise, there are three significant differences between Article 3 and Article 4, as follows:\n\na. Article 3 imposes obligations relating to the treatment of investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party in general, while Article 4 imposes obligations \"with respect to taxes\" and related charges imposed on the nationals of the Contracting Party.\n\nb. Article 3 requires fair and equitable treatment and national and MFN treatment (the latter repeated in the Protocol), while Article 4 requires only national and MFN treatment.\n\nc. Article 4 includes exceptions not included in Article 3(3).\n\n305.\n\nThe Claimants point out that the Treaty makes no explicit link between Article 3 and Article 4. Thus the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 3(1) is not expressly made \"subject to Article 4\" nor does Article 4 begin with the words \"notwithstanding Article 3(1)\", (only) national and MFN treatment is to be accorded in respect of taxes and charges. Article 4 is not, in their opinion, a tax \"carve-out\" provision such as that which they quoted from other BITs.321\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 300.\n\n306.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the drafters in this case did not use a \"carve-out\" approach because they did not need to. Rather they dealt in successive provisions with the general case in Article 3 and the specific case in Article 4. The specific provision must, its argument continues, within its area of operation, exclude the general one. What role could the specific provision play if the matters that it regulates were also to fall within the broader terms of Article 3(1) with its more extensive obligations, notably the obligation to ensure fair and equitable treatment? The Respondent also emphasises the significance in this context, as in others, of the care the Parties to the Treaty, and especially the Respondent itself, had taken in the drafting of Article 3 and the Protocol to prevent a broad reading being given to the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment.322\n\n*See* Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 377-380.\n\n307.\n\nThe Claimants respond that Article 4 does have a role while standing alongside and independently of the fair and equitable treatment obligation in Article 3. The overlap which they see relates only to discriminatory treatment on grounds of nationality in respect of taxes; in that case alone Article 3(3) would defer to Article 4. Article 4 does not occupy the field with respect to all Treaty issues relating to taxes.323\n\n*See* Tr. Day 14:3824:18-22 (Claimants\u2019 Counsel); Cl. Reply \u00b6 473.\n\n**(5) The Exceptions to Article 3 and Article 4**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nThe Tribunal now addresses the detail of the two sets of exceptions included in Article 3(3) and in Article 4 to the obligations which each of those articles imposes. Article 3(1), when read with the Protocol, requires, among other things, national and MFN treatment. Article 3(2) also requires such treatment. Article 3(3) then makes the following exceptions to the MFN treatment obligations:\n\nIf a Contracting Party has accorded special advantages to nationals of any third State by virtue of agreements establishing customs unions, economic unions, monetary unions or similar institutions, or on the basis of interim agreements leading to such unions or institutions, that Contracting Party shall not be obliged to accord such advantages to nationals of the other Contracting Party.\n\nThat list is to be compared with that included in Article 4, which sets out exceptions to the non-discrimination obligations that it imposes in respect of taxes and fiscal matters. In addition to the exceptions in respect of customs unions, economic unions or similar institutions, Article 4 contains a further exception: it excludes from the effect of the non-discrimination obligations special fiscal advantages accorded to a third Party by agreements for the avoidance of double taxation or on a reciprocal basis.\n\n**(6) Effective Interpretation**\n--------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nIf paragraph (1) of Article 3 (read with the Protocol) and paragraph (2) of that article applied generally to taxation measures, the MFN treatment requirements of the provisions would require that the benefit of those tax agreements with third States or that reciprocity be accorded to the other Party to the BIT. As noted,324 the Claimants, recognising that point, contend that to that extent but to that extent only Article 4 would override Article 3(3). But, on that reading, the remainder of Article 4 would have no effect at all and the provision would impose no obligation. That would be so notwithstanding the expressly mandatory terms of Article 4: each Contracting Party, it declares, \"shall accord\" national and MFN treatment. It would unnecessarily repeat those obligations that are already to be found in Article 3 along with the related provisions of the Protocol. It is a well-established principle for the interpretation of provisions of a treaty that they should if possible be interpreted so that they do not become devoid of effect.325 Further, if the drafters had intended the reading proposed by the Claimants, the direct way of achieving that would have been simply to include the double taxation exception in Article 3 and not to have included Article 4 at all. The Claimants\u2019 interpretation would transform a provision, which on its face places defined obligations on the Contracting Parties with carefully stated exceptions when they exercise their powers to impose taxes and charges, into nothing more than a provision adding further exceptions to an obligation imposed by another article which itself already contains specific exceptions, also included in the tax provision. That would be remarkably awkward drafting.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 307.\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Corfu Channel Case (Merits),* Judgment, 9 April 1949, I.C.J. Reports 1949, p. 4 at p. 24; *Case Concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation), Preliminary Objections,* Judgment, 1 April 2011, \u00b6 133.\n\n**(7) The Broader Context**\n---------------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe improbability of the Claimants\u2019 proposed reading of Article 4 as merely providing further limits on the Parties\u2019 non-discrimination obligation additional to those already to be found in Article 3(3) is increased by two contextual matters: the first specific to one of the Contracting Parties to the Treaty; and the second more general. The first is that the Netherlands\u2019 model bilateral investment treaty includes Article 3 and Article 4 in essentially the same form as they appear in the Netherlands-Venezuela Treaty, with the qualifications, already noted, of the inclusion of the Protocol relating to Article 3(1) and the replacement of the word \"unreasonable\" by \"arbitrary\". Further, that format and wording is adopted in the majority of the almost one hundred bilateral investment treaties which the Netherlands has signed. In a number of those Netherlands\u2019 bilateral investment treaties that do not have a separate provision about taxation along the lines of the standard Article 4, such as those with Chile, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Lebanon, Mexico, Mongolia, the Russian Federation and Slovakia, the double taxation agreement exception is included in the general provision requiring fair and equitable protection and non-discrimination which in other respects otherwise takes the standard Article 3 form.326 That drafting is one direct way of achieving the result which the Claimants seek.\n\nAgreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Chile, 30 November 1998; Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, 26 November 2001; Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, 29 April 1991; Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Hungarian People's Republic for the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments, 2 September 1987; Agreement between the Republic of India and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the promotion and protection of investments, 6 November 1995; Agreement on the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Lebanese Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, 2 May 2002; Agreement on promotion, encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United Mexican States, 13 May 1998; Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Mongolia, 9 March 1995; and Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Russian Federation, 5 October 1989.\n\n311.\n\nThe second contextual point is that, in at least five model bilateral investment treaties which have no separate taxation provision, double tax agreements are expressly excluded from the application of the non-discrimination obligations; *see, for instance,* the model bilateral investment treaties of the People\u2019s Republic of China (Article 8(3)), France (Article 4), Germany (Article 3), India (Article 4), and the United Kingdom (Articles 3 and 7).327\n\n2003 China Model BIT; 2006 France Model BIT; 2008 Germany Model BIT; 2003 India Model BIT; 2005 United Kingdom Model BIT, with 2006 amendments.\n\n312.\n\nThe Parties referred the Tribunal to a number of decisions in which investors made claims which the host State said were related to taxation and in terms of the relevant bilateral investment treaty fell outside the scope of its protection. Some of the decisions confirm the proposition, which both Parties accept, that the power to tax is in principle within the customary regulatory or sovereign powers of the State.\n\n313.\n\nThat proposition is reflected in many treaties by the exclusion from their coverage of matters of taxation, sometimes with exceptions to that exclusion, for instance when taxation measures amount to an expropriation. Such exclusions are to be found for instance in the model bilateral investment treaties of Canada (Article 16), the United States (Article 21), the US-Ecuador Treaty quoted earlier (Article X), the Energy Charter Treaty (Article 21) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Article 2103).328 The exclusions are also to be related to the very extensive body of treaties dealing specifically with the issues of taxation \u2014 a separate, large and highly technical field. All of the cases to which the Parties referred, as they also acknowledge, essentially turn on the specific way in which tax matters are regulated by the investment treaty in question. Those provisions are all markedly different from those in issue in this case. In particular, they all expressly address the relationship between the Parties\u2019 undertakings and matters of taxation by providing, for instance, that nothing in the Agreement in question applies to taxation or that only certain provisions, especially the prohibition on expropriation, apply. The Claimants emphasise the express terms of those provisions by contrast to the silence on that matter of Articles 3 and 4 of the Dutch Treaty. That silence, they contend, indicates that the two provisions are to operate alongside one another.\n\nEx. R-143, 2004 Canada Model BIT; Ex. R-142, 2004 US Model BIT; Ex. R-146, Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, 27 August 1993; Ex. R-140, Energy Charter Treaty; Ex. R-141, NAFTA.\n\n314.\n\nBecause of the different formulations of the taxation provisions at issue in those cases to the provisions in issue in this case, the Tribunal does not find them helpful except for their recognition of the special character of the State power of taxation.\n\n**(8) Conclusion Regarding the Scope of Article 3 and of Article 4**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nWhat is critical for the Tribunal is the wording and structure of Article 3 and Article 4. The wording and structure lead the Tribunal to the conclusion that matters of taxation, fees, charges and fiscal deductions and exemptions are subject only to the obligations stated in Article 4 and not to the more generally worded fair and equitable treatment obligation included in Article 3. This conclusion, in summary, follows from three features of the provisions. First, Article 3 imposes an apparently general treatment obligation in respect of investments, but is immediately followed by a provision, Article 4, specifically dealing with taxation and related measures in respect of investments. Second, Article 3 imposes the broad and absolute obligation of fair and equitable treatment (although qualified by the Protocol), while Article 4 imposes only the contingent obligations of national and MFN treatment, obligations already included in Article 3 along with the fair and equitable treatment standard. That repetition by itself indicates that each provision stands alone. That also appears from the third feature of the two Articles. While Article 3(3) excepts from the MFN treatment obligation stated in Article 3 special advantages accorded to nationals of a third state by virtue of agreements establishing customs unions, economic unions, monetary unions and similar bodies, it does not, by contrast to Article 4, exclude \"special fiscal advantages\" accorded under double taxation agreements or on the basis of reciprocity with a third State.\n\n316.\n\nThe determination of the meaning of the provisions must also have regard both to the evident concern of Venezuela to limit its obligations under Article 3 and to the special character of the power of a State to impose taxation. Other significant contextual matters supporting the interpretation are, first, the near consistency of the wording of the Venezuelan Treaty with that of many of the Netherlands\u2019 bilateral investment treaties.329 A second contextual matter is the way in which the model bilateral investment treaties of a number of other States deal with taxation - some expressly exclude matters of taxation largely or entirely. If they do not make that express exclusion, but rather leave matters of taxation within the scope of general fair and equitable treatment and MFN treatment obligations, they make express exceptions for double taxation and other fiscal agreements.\n\n*See supra \u00b6310.*\n\n317.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the changes made to the Venezuelan law challenged by the Claimants \"with respect to taxes, fees, charges, and to fiscal deductions and exemptions\" do not fall within the scope of Article 3. As already noted,330 the Claimants do not contend that any of those changes breach the non-discrimination prohibitions included in Article 4.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 307.\n\n**(9) Do the Measures Adopted by Venezuela Relating to Taxes and Royalties Fall Within Article 4 of the BIT?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nOne of the measures challenged by the Claimants, namely, the Law Partially Reforming the Income Tax Law dated 29 August 2006,331 amends the Income Tax Law by increasing the applicable rate of income tax from 34 percent to 50 percent. There cannot be any doubt that that is a measure with respect to \"taxes\". But are royalties, such as those changed in the Law Partially Reforming Decree No. 1,510 with Force of the Organic Hydrocarbons law of 16 May 2006,332 to be seen differently? That question would also arise in respect of the proposed increase in royalties announced on 10 October 2004,333if that were relevant notwithstanding the Claimants\u2019 withdrawal of its reservation of its rights on 14 January 2005.334\n\nEx.

The Executive Branch was given the authority both to lower the tax to make commercial production possible and to raise the previously lowered production tax to the original rate when it deemed that the reasons for lowering it no longer existed. Article 41 and all of the other provisions in that Part use the word \"tax\" to refer to the regulation and calculation of the royalty, as well as to refer to other taxes.\n\nEx. C-50, *Ley de Reforma Partial de la Ley de Hidrocarburos* (Law Partially Reforming the Hydrocarbons Law), Extraordinary Official Gazette No. 1,149, published 15 September 1967.\n\n321.\n\nArticle 1 of the Royalty Agreement of the Strategic Associations of the Orinoco Oil Belt between the Ministry of Energy and Mines336 and PdVSA of 29 May 1998 provides as follows:337\n\nThe object of this Agreement is to set the basis for the calculation of the exploitation tax contemplated in Article 41 of the Hydrocarbons Law (hereinafter the \"Royalty\") and applicable to the exploitation of extra heavy crudes from the Orinoco Oil Belt by Participants, in the above associations or projects (hereinafter the \"Association\"), pursuant to Article 5 of the Organic Law that Reserves for the State the Industry and Commerce of Hydrocarbons, in the areas determined to that effect by the Ministry.\n\nThe covering letter from the Ministry to PdVSA of 11 June 1998, (enclosing 11 copies of the Agreement) states that the Agreements \"will apply in the Strategic Associations approved by the Sovereign Congress of the Republic for the exploitation and upgrading of crude from the Orinoco Oil Belt\". The letter concludes by saying that \"it is important that the participants of the associations indicate in writing their \u2018intention to adhere to such Agreements\u2019\". The Royalty Agreements were to be in force for up to nine years.338\n\nThe name of the Ministry of Energy and Mines was changed in 2005 to the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum and again, in 2007, to the People\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum. *See* Cl.

The Venezuelan legislation, the agreements and the adherences all treat the royalty payments as a tax.\n\n(b) The Presentation of the Claimants\u2019 Case With Respect to the Relevant Measures\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal now considers the section of the Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration headed as follows:\n\n**In 2005 And 2006, Venezuela Abrogated Its Commitments With Respect To**  **The Fiscal Regime**  **Applicable To The Petrozuata And Hamaca Associations (Emphasis added.)**\n\nIt specified the breaches in this way:342\n\n[...] Most significantly, on May 16, 2006, the Venezuelan National Assembly implemented an \u2018extraction tax\u2019 of one-third of the value of all hydrocarbons extracted. This extraction tax functions in a manner identical to a royalty. Indeed, the law specifically provides that royalty payments could be credited against amounts owed for the extraction tax. Thus, whereas Venezuela had originally used the promise of a nine-year royalty of one percent and a maximum royalty of 16.66 percent to induce ConocoPhillips to invest in Venezuela, the extraction tax required that ConocoPhillips pay in substance a royalty of 33.33 percent for all extra-heavy oil produced.\n\nThe dismantling of the fiscal regime promised to ConocoPhillips was completed shortly thereafter when, on August 29, 2006, the National Assembly approved a change in the income tax law that increased the tax rate for the extra-heavy oil projects, including the Petrozuata and Hamaca Associations, from 34 to 50 percent, effective January 1, 2007.\n\nRFA \u00b6\u00b6 70, 72 (emphasis added).\n\n326.\n\nIn the relevant part of their Memorial, headed \"Total Abrogation by Venezuela of its Fiscal Commitments to ConocoPhillips in 2005 and 2006\", the Claimants, after referring to the increase in the income tax rate,343 referred to \"the next confiscatory \u2018step\u2019: The Extraction Tax\".344 In their description of that measure, they mention the announcement by the Venezuelan President of a new \"Extraction Tax\" and the National Assembly\u2019s prompt approval of it. The Memorial then says the following:345\n\nThe new Extraction Tax effected a *de facto* increase in the existing production tax (royalty) regime. The new tax functioned in a manner identical to the royalty required under the production tax because; *(a)* it was calculated on the value of liquid hydrocarbons extracted; (b) the taxpayer had the right to deduct any amount paid as royalty from the amount of Extraction Tax owed; and (c) the calculation method was the same as that set out in the New Hydrocarbons Law for calculating royalty payments in cash. Minister Ramirez, Vice Minister Mommer and President Ch\u00e1vez have all affirmed that the introduction of the Extraction Tax raised the effective royalty rate to 33 1/3 percent. For the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects, this meant that within a period of 18 months, the applicable royalty rate had been taken from one percent to 33 1/3 percent.\n\nThe Claimants conclude this part of the Memorial by quoting from a speech of 29 July 2007 by the Venezuelan President in which, in their words, he described \"the Extraction Tax as another \u2018step\u2019 in his administration\u2019s plan to confiscate the interests of ConocoPhillips\".346 The Memorial, referring again to the Income Tax increase, states that, with that change, \"Venezuela accomplished the full and final dismantling of the fiscal regime guaranteed to ConocoPhillips in respect of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects\". The Memorial then refers to the letter of protest of 29 November 2006 sent by ConocoPhillips to the Hydrocarbons Vice-Minister.347 That letter included this passage:348\n\nIn particular, we note that in recent months, the government of Venezuela has (i) amended the Hydrocarbons Law (amendments published in the Official Gazette on May 24, 2006), creating an extraction tax of 33.33% applicable to all hydrocarbons extracted by ConocoPhillips, (ii) increased the income tax from 34% to 50%, effective January 1, 2007; and (iii) adopted Orders Nos. 313 and 314 of the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum (published in the Official Gazette on November 14, 2006), which involve the imposition of royalties of 30% on associated gas, condensate, liquid hydrocarbons, sulphur and coke produced by ConocoPhillips in Venezuela.\n\nThese changes, among others, negatively affect and will continue to negatively affect ConocoPhillips\u2019 legitimate expectations, based on the guarantees offered by the Venezuelan State.\n\nCl.

Day 14:3827:13.\n\n329.\n\nThe Respondent in its argument similarly treated the changes to the tax and royalty rates in terms of the provisions of the BIT without distinguishing between them. Given the way that the Claimants presented their claims, the Respondent had no reason to make any distinction. The Respondent contended that those changes were \"tax and fiscal measures\", which, if governed by Article 4, were not in breach of that provision since the changes were not discriminatory.352 In its opinion, stated in its Rejoinder, \"as Claimants\u2019 fair and equitable treatment claims relate solely to the changes in the tax and royalty rates, the provisions of Article 4 govern\".353 It argued in the alternative that if the measures were not exclusively governed by Article 4, the \"tax and fiscal measures\" did not in any event breach the fair and equitable standard set forth in the BIT.354 That is to say the Respondent, on its view of Article 4, does not argue that the royalty payments are \"taxes\" according to some specific definition of the word.\n\nResp. C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 217-26.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 392.\n\nResp. C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 227-35.\n\n(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion That the Relevant Measures Fall Within Article 4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nThe positions of the Parties as presented by the Parties during the course of the arbitration indicate that the tax and royalty measures constitute a \"fiscal regime\". That understanding of the opening phrase in Article 4 is supported by the first meaning of \"fiscal\" in the Oxford English Dictionary:\n\n\"of or pertaining to the fisc or treasury of a State or Prince; pertaining to the public revenue\".\n\nTo go to the noun, the applicable definition of \"fisc\" is the State treasury. Royalties such as those in issue here are payable to the State. The royalties, along with the taxes, are part of the public revenue.\n\n331.\n\nIt may also be noted that in terms of standard legal definitions of tax, such as those in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary and Thomas M Cooley\u2019s writings on taxes and constitutional law, royalties such as those here may well qualify as taxes. Those definitions involve a charge levied by the State by virtue of its sovereignty to yield public revenue for the support of government and for all public needs. The Tribunal need not, however, decide that issue since royalties appear without any question to fall within the compendious phrase used at the beginning of Article 4 and in particular within \"fiscal deductions\".\n\n332.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the measures taken in May and August 2006 do not fall within the scope of Article 3. It follows that the Tribunal need not go on to consider whether those measures breached the fair and equitable treatment standard set out in that provision and elaborated in the Protocol to the BIT. As already noted, the Claimants accept that the measures did not breach Article 4.\n\n**B. Claims for Breach of the Obligation Not to Expropriate Under Article 6 of the Netherlands-Venezuela Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined in the previous section of this Decision that the Dutch Claimants are unable to base their claims on the fair and equitable treatment standard included in Article 3 of the BIT. It accordingly now turns to Article 6 of the BIT which the Claimants contend has also been breached by the Respondent. It provides as follows:\n\n\"Article 6\n\nNeither Contracting Party shall take any measures to expropriate or nationalise investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party or take measures having an effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation with regard to such investments, unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\n(b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the Contracting Party taking such measures may have given;\n\n(c) the measures are taken against just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the market value of the investments affected immediately before the measures were taken or the impending measures became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier; it shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.\"\n\n334.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 submissions and evidence relating to this provision raised several issues. At this stage, the Tribunal proposes to make rulings on four of them:\n\n(1) the date of the valuation it is to make; is it the date of the taking, 26 June 2007, or the date of the Award?\n\n(2) were the measures taken by the Respondent expropriating or nationalizing the investments unlawful as a breach of Article 6(b) because they were contrary to any undertaking which the Respondent gave?\n\n(3) did the measures taken by the Respondent between 2004 and 2007 amount to a single taking and, as a consequence, was the taking unlawful, with the valuation of the investments being measured by applying the original royalty rate and income tax rate?\n\n(4) did the Respondent in the negotiations with the Claimants concerning the compensation payable in respect of the taking of the Claimants\u2019 investments negotiate in good faith in accordance the standard stated in Article 6(c) of market value of the investments immediately before the measures were taken or the impending measures became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, and were its actions accordingly lawful?\n\n335.\n\nThe Claimants, to quote their Memorial, have not challenged and in the arbitration do not challenge, the Respondent\u2019s sovereign prerogative to nationalize. But, they continue, the Respondent must exercise that prerogative lawfully.355. They contend, in brief, that the takings were unlawful for one or more of the reasons indicated in questions (2)-(4) in paragraph 334 above, and that because of that unlawfulness the value is to be determined at the date of the Award. The Respondent submits that the takings were lawful and that, whether the taking is lawful or not, it is the date of taking that is the date of valuation.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 19.\n\n336.\n\nIt is convenient to consider the issue of the valuation date ahead of the three issues of lawfulness: if the date of the taking is the valuation date whether the taking is lawful or not, the Tribunal would not need to consider those three issues.\n\n**(1) The date of valuation of the investment taken by the Respondent**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Claimants contend, on the basis of principle and the authorities, that if the taking is unlawful then the date of the award and not the date of the taking is in general the date of valuation.356 That submission is supported by the fact that \"as a result of improving market conditions in the energy sector, the [three projects] have increased in value since the final act of confiscation by Venezuela on June 26, 2007\"357. The Claimants submit that the Treaty is silent on the standard of reparation for takings carried out other than in accordance with the conditions specified in Article 6 of the BIT; \"in these circumstances,\" they continue, \"it is well settled that tribunals must look to customary international law for the applicable standard of reparation\"358. They cite a number of authorities in support of this submission. The first in time is the Judgment of the Permanent Court of International Justice in *Chorz\u00e1w Factory* (Merits) PCIJ Pubs A17, where the taking in issue was unlawful; it was in breach of Poland\u2019s obligations:\n\nThe action of Poland which the Court has judged to be contrary to the Geneva Convention is not an expropriation \u2014 to render which lawful only the payment of fair compensation would have been wanting; it is a seizure of property, rights and interests which could not be expropriated even against compensation, save under the exceptional conditions fixed by Article 7 of the said Convention. As the Court has expressly declared in Judgment No. 8, reparation is in this case the consequence not of the application of Articles 6 to 22 of the Geneva Convention, but of acts contrary to those articles. (A No. 17, p. 46.)\n\nThe Court continued in terms of principle:\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act \u2014 a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals \u2014 is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it \u2014 such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law. (A No. 17, p. 47; see also p. 29.)\n\nAt an earlier stage in the case, it had said this:\n\nIt is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form. Reparation therefore is the indispensable complement of a failure to apply a convention and there is no necessity for this to be stated in the convention itself. (A No. 9, p. 21.)\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6 388\n\n338.\n\nThe Claimants seek support from decisions to the same effect of other ICSID tribunals, the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, the European Court of Human Rights and *ad hoc* international tribunals, scholarly writing and the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001). Article 31 (1) of that text, headed Reparation, provides that:\n\nThe responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n339.\n\nIn support of that provision, the Commission cited passages from the *Chorz\u00f3w* judgment including those quoted above. \"Full reparation\" may take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction either singly or in combination (Article 34). Under Article 36(2) \"The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\" Those ILC Articles, supported in their commentaries by reference to the authorities, have been regularly referred to in subsequent decisions, including ICSID awards and decisions, as codifying or declaring customary international law, *e.g. ADC v. Hungary359, LG&E* v. *Argentine Republic360', CMS Gas Transmission Company* v. *Argentine Republic361,* and *Siemens AG* v. *Argentine Republic362,* and other decisions and awards summarised in the UN Secretariat Reports A/62/62, paragraphs 103-115, and A/65/76, paragraphs 28-43). A number of those cases, in addition to citing the ILC articles and *Chorz\u00e1w Factory,* refer to a consistent body of earlier decisions including *Texaco* v. *Libya* (1977)363 and *Amoco* v. *Iran* (1987).364.\n\n*ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v.

From the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case it refers particularly to the proposition that \"in the normal case, failure to pay compensation does not change the valuation date\"366. That, it says, is the teaching of basically all the decisions. It cites the Tribunal in the *LIAMCO* case which, after discussing *Chorzow Factory,* said this:\n\nin a lawful expropriation where the only wrongful act was the failure to pay the just price of what had been expropriated, the compensation due should be the value of the undertaking at the time of dispossession.367\n\nResp.

Costa Rica368*, in which the Tribunal determined the value of the property expropriated as at the date of its taking. The Claimants, in response, submit that the *Santa Elena* and *LIAMCO* cases involved lawful takings, while the takings in this case were unlawful (referring also to *Vivendi v. Argentina)369*\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v.

Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3) Award of 20 August 2007, at \u00b6\u00b6 8.2.1-8.2.7.\n\n342.\n\nThe Tribunal, coming back to the terms of the BIT, does not consider that the extent of the compensation payable in respect of an unlawful taking of an investment, for instance because it is in breach of an \"undertaking\" in terms of Article 6(b), is to be determined under Article 6(c): that provision establishes a condition to be met if the expropriation is in all other respects in accordance with Article 6. So, in the *Chorzow* case, the Court did not determine reparation in accordance with the provisions of the Convention before it, because it was concerned with a dispossession in breach of those provisions. It decided in accordance with \"the essential principle\" quoted earlier, that is a principle of customary international law, not dependent on the Convention provisions. The other cases cited are also to be understood in that way. Next, the cases cited by the Respondent in which the Tribunal fixed the compensation by reference to the value of the property at the time of the taking are cases where the taking was lawful and the only allegedly wrongful act was the claimed failure to pay the value of the investment to be fixed, either in terms of the relevant treaty or customary international law, at the time of the taking;370 in *Santa Elena,* the valuation submissions by the Parties and the tribunal\u2019s assessment related only to the date of taking; the Respondent also refers to *Mondev* v. *The United States of America371*, but there too the dictum relates to lawful expropriation.\n\n*LIAMCO, Santa Elena, In the Matter of an Arbitration between the Government of the State of Kuwait and The American Independent Oil Company (Aminoil),* 21 International Legal Materials 976 (1982) Award of 24 March 1982, *Antoine Goetz and others v.

United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award of 11 October 2002, at \u00b6 71.\n\n343.\n\nThe Tribunal, on the basis of principle and the authorities reviewed above, concludes that if the taking was unlawful, the date of valuation is in general the date of the award. The Tribunal accordingly turns to the contentions of the parties about the lawfulness of the taking of the investments, as listed in paragraph 334 (2)-(4) above.\n\n**(2) Did the Respondents taking of the Claimants\u2019 investments breach an \"undertaking\" in terms of Article 6(b) of the BIT?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article 6 provides that neither Contracting Party shall take any measures to expropriate or nationalize investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party unless, among other things,\n\n(b) \"the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the Contracting Party taking such measures may have given.\"\n\n345.\n\nIn the final stage of the hearings the Claimants\u2019 argument had moved away from the submissions made in the written pleadings and at the opening of the hearings that the Respondent had abrogated fiscal guarantees372. Even in the absence of express stabilization, their counsel contended, international law provided protection for \"commitments made by a State to induce an investment where the commitment is relied upon by the Investor\"373. Counsel cited investment arbitration cases as demonstrating that the State did not have a magic eraser that could erase the terms on the basis that there were no legitimate expectations unless there exists a stabilization agreement. Several cases were cited in support of the proposition that\n\nwhere there is a relationship, a specific relationship and negotiated relationship between the State and a foreign investor on the strength of which investment occurs, the foreign investor changes its position, commits itself to the State, makes an investment in the territory of the State, the consequence is not a treaty, not a reversal of the principle of sovereignty, but a legitimate expectation entitled to respect.374\n\nCl. Reply, at IV.B.l.\n\nSee Tr. Day 13:3497.\n\nSee Tr. Day 13:3499.\n\n346.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent submitted that those cases did not support the Claimants\u2019 position in law and in fact. He also cited other cases which in his view supported the Respondent\u2019s position.375\n\nSee Tr. Day 13:3667-3671.\n\n347.\n\nThe cases in which the particular claimants alleged breaches of their legitimate or reasonable expectations turned on fair and equitable treatment obligations included in the relevant treaty or on provisions requiring decisions in accordance with \"international law\" among other sources. Given the ruling which the Tribunal has already made that the claims in respect of the tax measures do not fall within the scope of the FET provision of Article 3 but within Article 4 concerned with taxation and related matters, no breach of which is alleged, those cases are not relevant. Rather what has to be determined in this case is whether Venezuela has given \"an undertaking\" which it has breached by its taking of the Claimants\u2019 assets.\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal understands the word \"undertaking\" to bear its ordinary meaning of a promise. In the context of a binding international agreement, the promise is one which is binding in law on the person who has made it. That meaning gains further support from the careful particularity of the statements of obligation included in the substantive provisions of the agreement and its protocol both of which, as already noted, depart in important ways from the Netherlands model investment treaty.\n\n349.\n\nHave the Claimants demonstrated on the basis of the evidence presented to the Tribunal that the Respondent gave undertakings to the Claimants or their predecessors in respect of the tax and related measures which were breached by the changes made to those measures and by the taking of the Claimants\u2019 assets?\n\n350.\n\nThe Claimants, through their counsel at the final stages of the hearing, effectively provided the answer, a negative one, to that question. Their argument, as noted, was no longer in terms of guarantees or express stabilization provisions but was made by reference to legitimate or reasonable expectations, with at best passing and unsupported references to \"commitments\".376 But such expectations cannot themselves establish a commitment of the kind contemplated by Article 6(b). At best, they might fall within the scope of the fair and equitable cause in Article 3, but, for the reasons already given that is not available to the Claimants in this case.\n\nSee Tr. Day 13:3414 and Tr. Day 14:3831.\n\n351.\n\nIn any event, as the cross-examination of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses by reference to the documentary record so clearly showed, no undertaking can be found in that record.377.\n\nSee Tr. Day 13:3645-3653.\n\n352.\n\nAccordingly, this part of the claim fails.\n\n**(3) Did the measures taken by the Respondent between 2004 and 2007 amount to a single taking and, as a consequence, was the taking unlawful, with the valuation of the investments being measured by applying the original royalty rate and income tax rate?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nThe Claimants contend the Respondent must compensate them for the value of their investments excluding the effect of all of its unlawful and expropriatory measures.378 The \"single taking\", they submit, is established as a matter of fact by statements made by President Chavez on 29 July 2007 and by Minister Ramirez on 8 February 2008. Each of the five progressive steps, consisting of incremental breaches of the promised fiscal regime, was interconnected by design. The interconnected nature of the Respondent\u2019s actions was detailed by none other than President Chavez in that speech in which he revealed the plan put in place years before the projects went into commercial operation.379 The Claimants conclude their discussion of the facts in this way:\n\nIn asking the Tribunal to consider Venezuela\u2019s measures from 2004 to 2007 as a single taking, ConocoPhillips has asked the Tribunal to consider those measures in the very same manner as President Chavez and Minister Ramirez have publicly described them: as progressively giving Venezuela a greater take of ConocoPhillips\u2019 investments until it finally \"buried\" them. Venezuela would understandably prefer that the Tribunal only consider ConocoPhillips\u2019 investments at the burial stage so that it may be rewarded with a discount for expropriating ConocoPhillips\u2019 investments.380\n\nCl. Reply at IV; C-Mem at IV A.\n\nCl. Mem. at \u00b6 297.\n\nCl. Reply, at \u00b6 424.\n\n354.\n\nOn the law, the Claimants contend that the cases they cite stand for the proposition that a tribunal does not merely look at the last and final act in order to assess liability and the nature of the expropriation.381 Because the measures were interconnected, the value of the confiscated interests of the Claimants must be measured according to the value of the investments applying the royalty rate and income tax rate the Respondent had guaranteed to induce the investments.382\n\nCl. Reply, at \u00b6 426.\n\nCl.

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent points out that the Claimants in their Reply did not even try to rehabilitate or justify their inaccurate portrayal of the cases they cited.385 In the Rejoinder the Respondent provides a further review of the cases cited by the Claimants.386\n\nResp.

Rej. at\u00b6\u00b6 454-470.\n\n356.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimants hope by this argument to impose liability for measures which were themselves entirely lawful.387 All of those measures taken from 2004 to 2006, were non-discriminatory and non-confiscatory, and none of them deprived the Claimants of the \"fruits\" of their investment or forced them to abandon their interests.388\n\nResp. Rej. at\u00b6 451.\n\nResp. Rej. at \u00b6 468.\n\n357.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Claimants\u2019 \"single taking\" theory has no basis in fact. The speeches they cite were not some sort of confession of a single plan in existence years before the February 2007 Decree. Rather, they were simply a review of the measures taken. The history shows the opposite of what the Claimants submit. It was not until January 2007 that the decision was made to require migration:\n\nUntil then, the policy had been to correct what the Government considered to be irregularities in the associations and to ensure fairness in the royalty and tax regime. Claimants\u2019 pure speculation that the Government had something else in mind all along flies in the face of the entire record in this case.389\n\nResp. C-Mem. at \u00b6 268; Resp. Rej. at \u00b6\u00b6 472-474.\n\n358.\n\nAt the opening of the hearings, counsel for the Claimants played a video of President Ch\u00e1vez\u2019 speech and recalled the speeches of Minister Ramirez ;390 he also referred to the cases cited in the pleadings, but without responding to the Respondent\u2019s review of those cases.391 Counsel for the Respondent referred to that review and its understanding of the cases; he also contended, citing relevant authorities, that government officials are presumed to be acting in good faith.392 The Respondent came back to the good faith issue in the final rounds,393 when the matter was otherwise the subject of only limited attention.\n\nSee Tr. Day 1:57; Tr. Day 1:194-200.\n\nSee Tr. Day 1:200-201.\n\nSee Tr. Day 2:445-446.\n\nSee Tr. Day 13:3690-3691.\n\n359.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that it has decided that the challenges by the Claimants to changes in the tax and royalty law fail. These changes were not taken in breach of Article 4 which excludes the application of Article 3 in its field of application. Accordingly, for that reason alone, the single taking contention, insofar as it would characterise those changes as unlawful and make them relevant to the calculation of quantum, must fail.\n\n360.\n\nIt follows that the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to resolve the other issues of fact and law presented by this submission.\n\n**(4) Did the Respondent in the negotiations about compensation negotiate in good faith by reference to the standard in Article 6(c) of the BIT?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nArticle 6 provides that neither Contacting Party shall take any measures to expropriate or nationalise investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party unless, among other things:\n\n(c) the measures are taken against just compensation. Such compensation shall represent the market value of the investments affected immediately before the measures were taken or the impending measures became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier; it shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment and shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without undue delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants are nationals or in any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.\n\n362.\n\nThe requirements for prompt payment and for interest recognise, in accordance with the general understanding of such standard provisions, that payment is not required at the precise moment of expropriation. But it is also commonly accepted that the Parties must engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the standard set, in this case, in the BIT, if a payment satisfactory to the investor is not proposed at the outset.\n\n(a) The submissions of the Parties\n----------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with the Parties\u2019 submissions which were based on the evidence they presented about the negotiations by way of documents and written testimony by witnesses who were subject to examination before the Tribunal. It then examines and assesses that evidence in detail. The evidence relates to two overlapping periods, the first, from 2006 to early 2007, concerning the proposed migration of the projects into *empresas mixtas* and the second from early 2007 concerning the negotiations both before the taking of the investments, in June 2007, and beyond.\n\n364.\n\nThe witnesses who testified about the negotiations were Mr A. Roy Lyons, President of ConocoPhillips Venezuela from 2005 to June 2008 called by the Claimants; and Dr Bernard Mommer, the Venezuelan Vice-Minister of Hydrocarbons from January 2005 to June 2008, called by the Respondent394. The documentary evidence consists of the Respondents\u2019 non binding term sheets of August 2006 relating to the migration of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Associations395, the Respondent\u2019s draft contracts of 17 and 22 January 2007 for the migration of the three Associations, the three ConocoPhillips \"trigger\" letters of 31 January 2007396, its three letters of 12 April 2007 responding to oral proposals made on 29 and 31 March 2007397, three requests by the Ministry in May 2007 for comments by ConocoPhillips on a draft contract for the conversion of Hamaca to an *empresa mixta* which was attached to the first request, but which was not included in that exhibit submitted to the Tribunal398, the two written proposals made by ConocoPhillips in June and August 2007399,and various public statements made in 2007 and 2008 by ConocoPhillips officials and Venezuelan Ministers. The limited extent of the documentation may be explained by a confidentiality agreement referred to in the proceedings, but not documented or given any precision400 or by the fact that offers stated expressly that they were made without prejudice, or both.\n\nGregory Goff testified very briefly that he was heavily involved in the compensation negotiations, that he had signed a confidentiality agreement and that the negotiations went on for a long time; *(See.* Tr.

Jeff W Sheets testified that he was aware of discussions within senior management in 2005, 2006 and 2007 about the Association Agreements and their compensation provisions but was not involved in them *(See.* Tr.

In fact, ConocoPhillips would have to pay a bonus in order to participate in the new **empresas mixtas,** and would also have to waive all claims arising from the expropriation.402\n\nCl.

Mem. at \u00b6 228.\n\n366.\n\nOn 16 January 2007 Rafael Ramirez, the Minister of Hydrocarbons, was reported as saying that the Government was initiating a new phase in discussions on the partnership agreements for companies operating in the Orinoco Oil Belt through a nationalization law. In 2006 it had not been possible to reach agreements with the foreign oil companies:\n\nThe Minister said that once the nationalization law is issued, we can provide details on the time frames. For now, we are calling on all partners to discuss separately what their future will be in these strategic partnerships.\n\n367.\n\nMr Lyons, in his testimony, said that the August 2006 terms were unacceptable to ConocoPhillips and that with his colleagues he made that clear in discussions with Mr Del Pino, a PdVSA executive, and Dr Bernard Mommer, Vice-Minister of Hydrocarbons. On 17 and 22 January 2007, ConocoPhillips received copies of draft contracts for the conversion of each of the three Associations into an *empresa mixta.* Under their terms ConocoPhillips would, according to the submissions, in relation to the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects, (1) have a reduced stake in the new **empresa mixta,** (2) contribute an extra amount to the capital of the **empresa mixta,** (3) transfer all assets to the body, (4) receive no compensation, and (5) waive all claims. In the case of Hamaca, ConocoPhillips was also to pay a bonus403. According to the Claimants:\n\n[i]n sum, the migration comprised expropriation, minimal compensation in the form of a reduced participation in the resulting *empresa mixta* and waiver of all claims arising from the expropriation. But for the waiver requirement (which was unacceptable), ConocoPhillips might have been able to accept the terms of the migration in order to mitigate damages, knowing that it could sue to obtain further compensation for the expropriation. However, Venezuela never relented with respect to its waiver demand.404\n\nCl. Mem. at \u00b6\u00b6 229-231.\n\nCl.

C-Mem. at \u00b6 209.\n\n369.\n\nDr Mommer also testified that under the proposals the projects were to be doubled in area.406\n\nSee. Tr. Day 7:1848\n\n370.\n\nOn 31 January 2007, representatives of CoconoPhillips, including Mr Lyons, met representatives of the Venezuelan Ministry of Hydrocarbons, including Vice-Minister Mommer, and of PdVSA. Mr Lyons said that the Venezuelan officials were informed that the terms they proposed were inadequate. Accordingly, the waiver of all legal claims to additional compensation was plainly unreasonable. But, he says, Dr Mommer made it clear that the government did not intend to modify the terms. \"In the circumstances, as a potential measure, we provided to the government trigger letters invoking our rights under the Foreign Investment Law and the applicable bilateral investment treaty.\"407\n\nEx. C-36 *supra* at fn. 198.\n\n371.\n\nFollowing the making of the \"Nationalization Decree\" on 26 February 2007 ConocoPhillips says that its executives attended a number of meetings with the President of the PdVSA subsidiary, Minister Ramirez and Vice-Minister Mommer among others. The Claimants considered that the latter made it clear that Venezuela had no intention of compensating ConocoPhillips adequately for the forced transfer of the projects. ConocoPhillips informed Venezuela that it would not relinquish its rights and interests without adequate compensation.408 At a meeting held on 29 March 2007, Venezuela, ConocoPhillips says, made offers in respect of its interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca projects but not in respect of Corocoro. These offers, according to the Claimants, came nowhere close to reflecting the fair market value of those interests. On 12 April 2007 Mr Lyons wrote letters in respect of each of the three projects to the Minister, the Vice-Minister and the President of the PdVSA subsidiary referring to that meeting and another held on 31 March. In those letters, ConocoPhillips stated it \"would like to continue efforts to negotiate in good faith the possibility of an agreement with respect to the terms on which ConocoPhillips will participate in the migration of [each] Project with a mixed company... pursuant to [the 26 February 2007] Decree...\". There remained, however, fundamental differences between ConocoPhillips and the Government about the terms for nationalization. In that context the letters referred to two verbal compensation proposals made at a meeting of 29 March 2007. Mr Lyons asked for confirmation of the proposals in several respects.409\n\nCl. Mem. at \u00b6 238.\n\nEx. C-241, *supra* fn. 397.\n\n372.\n\nMr Lyons in his testimony says that from March to June 2007 he participated in further meetings with Ministry and PdVSA officials, in which, together with other ConocoPhillips personnel, he attempted to engage in good faith negotiations for fair compensation. He referred in particular to the meeting of 29 March and the ConocoPhillips responses to the offers made by the PdVSA official. The last meeting, of at least nine held since January before the final deadline of 26 June 2007 fixed in the February 2007 Decrees, was held on 20 June. On 26 June, Venezuela, he says, took the three ConocoPhillips investments in their entirety without providing any compensation at all.\n\n373.\n\nThe Respondent submits that\n\nIn an attempt to reach agreement on an orderly and amicable migration, representatives of the ConocoPhillips companies were called to several meetings to discuss drafts of the documents for conversion of the associations to mixed companies. However, unlike the other companies, including its own partners in the Hamaca Project (Chevron) and the Corocoro Project (Eni), ConocoPhillips refused to participate in the negotiation process in any meaningful manner. The meetings did proceed with the other companies, and, in most cases, reached a successful conclusion, much like the earlier process for the migration of the Operating Service Agreements.410\n\nThe indispensable fact remains that ConocoPhillips is one of only two exceptions and that virtually the entire international oil industry continues to do business and seek new business opportunities in Venezuela411.\n\nResp. C-Mem. \u00b6 112.\n\nResp. C-Mem. at fh. 211.\n\n374.\n\nThe Respondent continues that although ConocoPhillips refused to participate in any meaningful way in the migration process, the Venezuelan Government agreed to discuss reasonable compensation. As reported in the press, \"those discussions proceeded in good faith on an amicable basis for some time\". It quoted the ConocoPhillips CEO, Mr Mulva, speaking in early 2008:\n\nWe continue our discussions with PdVSA and the Venezuelan authorities... I believe that we are making progress. It will take time. I would like to see and hope that we can come to some sort of solution to this in 2008...\n\nWe\u2019re going to do this in a very deliberate way[;] the objective is to reach an amicable solution so as not to follow the (arbitration) process though for a number of years.412\n\nResp. C-Mem. \u00b6 113.\n\n375.\n\nIt refers to the two written proposals made by ConocoPhillips on 15 June 2007 and 17 August 2007 referred to in Dr Mommer\u2019s evidence. He says of the second of those proposals, a modification of the first, that it was completely unrealistic because it gave no consideration to the compensation formulas negotiated at the outset and applicable to the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects and did not refer the true value of the interests at issue without considering those formulas. Dr Mommer refers to the settlement discussions in these terms: \"we were always open to paying reasonable compensation, but ConocoPhillips from the beginning insisted on exorbitant sums that made settlement impossible\".413 The Respondent says of the ConocoPhillips proposals that they were based on unrealistic assumptions regarding both valuation and legal issues and totally disregarded the express limitations of liability provided for under both the Congressional Authorizations and the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association agreements. Those elaborate compensation provisions were negotiated at great length more than a decade earlier. In short neither the amounts sought then or in this case has ever been a serious compensation demand.414 It emphasises, especially in its Rejoinder, the Claimants\u2019 failure to call attention to the compensation provisions.415\n\nDirect Testimony of Dr Bernard Mommer, 24 July 2009 \u00b6 20.\n\nResp.

Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 15,240-243.\n\n376.\n\nThe Respondent, later in its Counter-Memorial, develops its argument that the claims of the Claimants relating to the two major projects, Petrozuata and Hamaca, have to be dismissed in any event because they fall foul of the carefully structured compensation provisions of the Congressional Authorizations and the Association Agreements governing those projects.416 Non economic measures, such as the change of operatorship, were not covered and \"significant economic damage\" had to be caused. The structure flowed from the condition of the Congressional Authorizations reserving the State\u2019s sovereign right to take action affecting the Projects but allowing Maraven and Corpoven to provide compensation in certain circumstances. Further, the February 2007 Decree was non-discriminatory in nature.\n\nResp. C-Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 146, 153, 156.\n\n377.\n\nThe Claimants, in their Reply, in response to the Respondent\u2019s contention that they were uncooperative in the compensation negotiations, quote public statements by Minister Ramirez in August 2007, February 2008 and September 2008 indicating that the Parties were in fact continuing to seek an amicable solution.417\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 133-134.\n\n378.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the Association Agreements cannot alter Venezuela\u2019s obligations to the Claimants under international law and that the compensation provisions are irrelevant to their claims.418 The Tribunal\u2019s interest at this stage is not with the substance of this difference between the Parties but rather with the role that the compensation provisions did or did not play in the negotiations from mid-2006 to 2007 and beyond.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 388, 391.\n\n379.\n\nAt the end of the hearings the Claimants submitted that:\n\nNow, if Venezuela had actually made a good faith offer of compensation and then provided a reasonable opportunity for the Parties to resolve their dispute, we accept that that would have been a lawful expropriation, sub modo, subject to the actual payment of compensation and interest. But that\u2019s not what happened.419\n\n*See.* Tr. Day 14:3852.\n\n380.\n\nThey recalled, from the migration period, Venezuela\u2019s failure to make any written compensation offer, its oral offers as set out in Mr Lyons\u2019 testimony, an account not contradicted by Venezuela, Mr Lyons\u2019 three April 2007 letters to which Venezuela did not reply, and Mr Lyons\u2019 evidence that Vice-Minister Mommer stated that compensation would not be based on fair market value; and, from the settlement negotiations period, when ConocoPhillips had decided not to migrate, the two proposals which ConocoPhillips made.420\n\n*See.* Tr. Day 14:3853-3855.\n\n381.\n\nThe Respondent countered by recalling that Dr Mommer had testified that it had offered and did discuss compensation in terms of market value in good faith and mentioning the impact of the compensation provisions. Further, the Respondent contrasted the claim of $30 billion made in the arbitration with the $6 or $7 billion offered by the Claimants. Further, there was over a year of intensive negotiations - a fact that in itself indicates a negotiation in good faith involving serious offers.421\n\n*See.* Tr. Day 14:3977-3979.\n\n(b) The Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the evidence relating to the negotiations\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n382.\n\nThe Tribunal now sets out the evidence more fully and makes its assessment of it. It begins with the evidence given by Mr Lyons and Dr Mommer. Mr Lyons states that he and his colleagues made it clear to Mr Del Pino of PdVSA and to Vice-Minister Mommer that the proposals made in the August 2006 term sheets for the migration were not acceptable.\n\nAlthough the terms of the proposed transition were not fully spelled out in the two-page term sheets, they clearly showed that Venezuela intended to take the existing interests of ConocoPhillips in those Projects, and offer in return a diminished stake and rights in the new *empresas mixtas.* The term sheets also demanded that we waive any claims in relation to the nationalization.422\n\nWitness Statement of A. Roy Lyons, 10 September 2008, at \u00b6 6.\n\n383.\n\nAlthough called as a witness, Mr Lyons was not cross-examined on this statement or indeed on any part of his written testimony about the negotiations from August 2006 until June 2007. (He held his position in Venezuela until June 2008.) Following the receipt of the draft contracts of 17 and 19 January 2007, Mr Lyons testifies that with a colleague he attended a meeting with Vice-Minister Mommer and several PdVSA officials:\n\nAt that meeting, we made clear that the terms being offered to compensate ConocoPhillips for relinquishing its rights in the existing Projects and migrating to the *empresas mixtas* regime were inadequate. Vice Minister Mommer made clear, however, that the government did not intend to modify these terms. In the circumstances, as a protective measure, we provided to the government trigger letters invoking our rights under Venezuela\u2019s Foreign Investment Law and applicable bilateral investment treaty.423\n\nEx. C-36 *supra* at fn. 198.\n\n384.\n\nThose \"trigger letters\" contained this passage:\n\nIn light of Venezuela\u2019s stated intention not to negotiate the terms of its expropriation with ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips reserves the right to submit the dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the Foreign Investment Law at any time necessary to protect its legal interests. In this context, ConocoPhillips accepts Venezuela\u2019s offers to submit this dispute to ICSID arbitration, as set forth in the Treaty and the Foreign Investment Law.424\n\n*Id.*\n\n385.\n\nDr Mommer in cross-examination said that he did not think that that was the breakpoint in the negotiations. The blanks in the model contracts remained negotiable as the success of the negotiations with the other Parties to the Association Agreements showed.425 Dr Mommer\u2019s testimony becomes specific, in terms of the sums proposed, only in respect of the proposals made by ConocoPhillips in June and August 2007, considered later426. In respect of the migration proposals of the second half of 2006 he says that he had various meetings with the project participants about restructuring with expansion opportunities but \"ConocoPhillips was not interested in these concepts\".427 In cross-examination, in response to the proposition that ConocoPhillips did seek to negotiate in that period, he said that they were less interested than the other two companies, but he would never say they were not interested.428 In his testimony he makes this general statement about the negotiations:\n\nConocoPhillips\u2019 argument that the Republic never offered to discuss reasonable compensation in connection with the migration is also untrue. At first, we hoped that the ConocoPhillips companies would join the migration. When they refused, we tried in good faith to reach an amicable settlement, as we had done successfully before with other companies. I was present in the settlement discussions with the ConocoPhillips representatives. We were always open to paying reasonable compensation, but ConocoPhillips from the beginning insisted on exorbitant sums that made settlement impossible.429\n\nSee. Tr. Day 7:1851.\n\n*Supra in.* 399, at \u00b6 28 and \u00b6 395.\n\n*Supra* fh. 399, at \u00b6 13.\n\n*See.* Tr. Day7:1855.\n\n*Supra* fh. 399, at \u00b6 20.\n\n386.\n\nHe also says:\n\nOf all the companies involved in the associations, ConocoPhillips exhibited the least interest in discussing migration. I had to call representatives many times to request their participation and comments. However, to my recollection, ConocoPhillips is the only company not to send a mark-up of the draft agreements for any of the three projects involved in this case. By contrast, the other partners in the Hamaca and Corocoro Projects (Chevron in the Hamaca Projects and Eni in the Corocoro Project) participated constructively, providing mark-ups of the documents and negotiating the terms and conditions of the migration. Both successfully completed the migration and now participate as shareholders in new mixed companies for those projects under the 2001 Organic Hydrocarbons Law. There was no migration of the Petrozuata Project because a ConocoPhillips subsidiary was the only foreign party participating in that project. In addition to ConocoPhillips\u2019 former partners, Chevron and Eni, the other companies successfully participating in the migration process for the associations included Total, Statoil, BP and Sinopec.430\n\n*Supra* fh. 399, at \u00b6 17.\n\n387.\n\nIn his supplemental testimony he does not address the negotiations and in particular Mr Lyons\u2019 testimony about ConocoPhillips\u2019 response to the August 2006 migration proposals or the positions ConocoPhillips took in January 2007 and in its letters of 12 April 2007, including the question asked by ConocoPhillips in respect of the position of the Venezuelan Government on book value.\n\n388.\n\nMr Lyons testifies that in March and April 2007, in further meetings, the ConocoPhillips representatives\n\nattempted to engage in good faith negotiations for fair compensation for the interests in the three Projects that would be taken away. While the Venezuelan side always acknowledged that the Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro Projects (and the underlying contracts) were fully legal and binding, they declined to offer anything approaching fair value for the investment interests that Venezuela would be taking. We made equally clear that ConocoPhillips would not relinquish its investments without fair compensation.431\n\n*Supra* fh. 422, at \u00b6 11.\n\n389.\n\nHe gives the example of a meeting on 29 March 2007 in which Mr Del Pino was accompanied by Vice-Minister Mommer.\n\nAt a meeting on March 29, 2007... Mr Del Pino, accompanied by Vice-Minister Mommer, made verbal offers for the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects. In each case, these offers included one amount (US$100 million for Petrozuata. US$370 million for Hamaca) if ConocoPhillips accepted an unprotected minority interest in the new *empresas mixtas* (40 percent for Petrozuata; 22.85 percent for Hamaca); or in the alternative, a higher amount (US$1.1 billion for Petrozuata, US$1.2 billion for Hamaca); if ConocoPhillips entirely relinquished its interests in the Projects. The offers also sought a full waiver from ConocoPhillips of its right to bring claims for adequate compensation. Venezuela made no offer at all with respect to the Corocoro Project.\n\nWe told Mr Del Pino and Vice-Minister Mommer that these offers were far below the fair market value of our interests in the Projects. Vice-Minister Mommer responded that compensation would not be based on fair market value.\n\nIn three letters (one for each Project) to Minister Ramirez, Vice-Minister Mommer and Dr. Del Pino dated April 12, 2007, ConocoPhillips restated the fundamental differences between the parties in the negotiations for compensation. We noted that any valuation based upon book value would neither adequately compensate ConocoPhillips for... Venezuela\u2019s unilateral changes in commercial terms (royalty and taxes) over the past several years, nor for the additional changes resulting from the Nationalization Decree. Moreover certain critical provisions were missing from the proposed migration contracts, including, among others, adequate minority governance rights and the right to recourse to international arbitration.432\n\n*Supra* fh. 422 \u00b6\u00b6 12-14; *See also.* Cl. Mem. at \u00b6 239.\n\n390.\n\nIn their Memorial the Claimants state that the 29 March verbal offer represented no more than 5 % of the real value of their investments and, therefore was totally inadequate.433\n\n*Id.*\n\n391.\n\nFollowing that and other meetings ConocoPhillips wrote on 12 April 2007 to the Minister, Vice-Minister and PdVSA Official in respect of each project (see *supra* \u00b6 371). The letters said that at the meeting of 29 March 2007:\n\nConocoPhillips received two verbal compensation proposals based upon book value less depreciation for its interests in the Petrozuata Project. The first compensation proposal, which contemplated ConocoPhillips holding a 40% interest in the Petrozuata Project post nationalization, was in the amount of U.S.$100,000,000. The second compensation proposal in the amount of U.S.$1,100,000,000 contemplated a complete exit of ConocoPhillips from the Petrozuata Project. We were informed during this meeting that the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela would not compensate ConocoPhillips for the fair market value of its interests in the Petrozuata Project. Please confirm that our understanding of the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela\u2019s compensation proposals as stated above is accurate and complete and further that the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela is willing to consider alternative compensation proposals as discussed in the March 31, 2007 meeting. As noted by Mr Mulva on March 31, 2007, any valuation based upon book value does not adequately compensate ConocoPhillips for the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela\u2019s unilateral changes in commercial terms (royalty and taxes) over the past several years nor for the additional changes resulting from the Nationalization Decree.\n\nIn addition to prompt, adequate and effective compensation for the unreduced fair market value of all losses, damages and other diminutions in value suffered by ConocoPhilips, in order to agree to participate in the migration of the Petrozuata Project ConocoPhillips will require that it be afforded adequate governance rights for a minority interest owner and the right to resolve disputes by international arbitration in a neutral forum, among other customary terms and conditions for these types of transactions.434\n\nNeither the Venezuelan Government nor PdVSA replied to these letters.\n\n*Supra* fh. 397.\n\n392.\n\nDr Mommer in cross-examination twice testified, in response to Mr Lyons\u2019 testimony, that he did not think he had said to the ConocoPhilips representatives that compensation would not be based on fair market value.435\n\nSee Tr. Day 7:1858, Tr. Day 7:1861-62.\n\n393.\n\nAgainst that general denial, made only at the hearings and not in the two rounds of written testimony, the Tribunal notes the contrary written testimony of Mr Lyons who was not cross-examined on this point. The Tribunal considers most significant in this respect the written account which the three letters give of the meetings of 29 and 31 January 2007, with their precise questions about the basis for valuation. The letters make it clear that ConocoPhillips rejects a valuation based on book value. That would not adequately compensate it. The Tribunal recalls that the Venezuelan authorities, which had received the trigger letters just 12 days earlier in which ConocoPhillips reserved all its legal rights under the Investment Law and the BIT, made no reply to those letters, they did not challenge the account the letters gave of the course of the meetings, and, in particular, they did not reject the position attributed to them that any compensation would not be based on fair market value. The Tribunal does of course recognise, in terms of the ruling made earlier in this decision that the royalty and tax changes are not in its view in breach of the BIT. But that was not known to the Parties at that stage of their negotiations.\n\n394.\n\nConsidering the situation after 12 April 2007, the date of those three letters, the Tribunal, on the basis of the evidence before it, concludes that Venezuela at that time was not negotiating in good faith by reference to the standard of \"market value\" set out in the BIT. It had not responded in any meaningful way to the points made about those negotiations, in particular in those letters. Two further important features of the negotiations support that conclusion. The first is that Venezuela had not yet made a proposal for compensation in respect of the Corocoro Project. The second is that there is no evidence at all that the compensation formulas played any part in the negotiations between the Parties.\n\n395.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the evidence concerning the negotiations from April 2007 before and after the taking of the assets. As already noted, Dr Mommer makes specific reference to the two ConocoPhillips proposals for compensation. The following paragraphs follow his general assessment of the course of the negotiations quoted earlier (\u00b6\u00b6 385 and 386 *supra):*\n\nConocoPhillips at first sought as compensation an asset exchange pursuant to which (a) the ConocoPhillips subsidiaries would relinquish all of their interests in Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro Projects and (b) ConocoPhillips would receive the interests of PdVSA subsidiaries in a refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana and a joint venture with ConocoPhillips at the Merey Sweeney refinery in Texas. At the time, the entire appraised value of the interests to be transferred to ConocoPhillips under this proposal was approximately US$8.2 billion. This proposal was made in a June 15, 2007 draft Memorandum of Understanding which is attached hereto as Appendix 4.\n\nJust two months later, by letter dated August 17, 2007 (a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix 5), ConocoPhillips made a new proposal. While the assets to be exchanged remained the same, this proposal included a cash payment of US$1.5 billion from ConocoPhillips to the Republic in recognition that the value of the refinery interests to be transferred by the PdVSA subsidiaries far exceeded the value of the ConocoPhillips subsidiaries\u2019 interests in Venezuela. The value of this proposal was approximately US$6.7 billion. Even though that amount is far below US$30billion that the ConocoPhillips entities are seeking in this Arbitration, it was nonetheless completely unrealistic because it gave no consideration to the compensation formulas that had been negotiated and agreed at the outset of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects and did not even reflect the true value of the interests at issue without considering those formulas.436\n\n*Supra* fii. 399 at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n396.\n\nExcept for the final sentence, these paragraphs do no more than purport to summarise the substance of the two proposals which appear as Appendices to Dr Mommer\u2019s testimony. He was not cross-examined on them. It will be observed that his comment in the final sentence is not presented as an account of a reason given by the Venezuelan authorities in June and August 2007 to ConocoPhillips for rejecting the proposals. That comment was not the subject of cross-examination.\n\n397.\n\nConocoPhillips in its covering note to the first proposal said that it was making it without prejudice to its existing legal rights in continuance of its good faith efforts to reach an amicable solution with Venezuela. It reserved the right to change the terms of the proposal and its rights under, *inter alia,* the BIT and the Investment Law. The covering letter to the second proposal \"appreciates the verbal compensation offer made to Roy Lyons on Monday August 13, 2007\"; that offer does not appear anywhere else in the evidence. After consideration, the letter continues, ConocoPhillips submitted the counterproposal attached and concluded:\n\nWe trust you will understand that the terms of this proposal reflect significant movement from ConocoPhillips\u2019 previous position and are made in a good faith effort to resolve our differences and reach agreement amicably and without the necessity of third party dispute resolution.\n\n398.\n\nMr Lyons in his evidence says only this about that final period, stopping short of the period after 26 June 2007 when the taking occurred:\n\nNegotiations continued throughout May and June 2007, but without producing an agreement. At a meeting that I attended on June 11, 2007, we again reiterated that the compensation being offered was a fraction of the true value of our investment interests, which we could not accept. Mr Del Pino made clear, however, that the nationalization process was nonnegotiable and would move forward on the government\u2019s terms, with or without ConocoPhillips.\n\nOur last meeting before the final deadline established in the Nationalization Decree took place on June 20, 2007. At that meeting, Vice Minister Mommer informed us that no new offer of compensation would be forthcoming prior to the June 26, 2007 deadline. He added that after that date, ConocoPhillips would no longer own any interest in the three Projects. Consistent with his statement, on June 26, 2007, Venezuela took our three investments in their entirety, without providing any compensation at all.437\n\n*Supra* fn *.* 422 at \u00b6\u00b6 18-19\n\n399.\n\nThe only other evidence before the Tribunal about the later phase of the negotiations appears in reports of public statements made by the ConocoPhillips CEO on 12 February 2008 quoted earlier *(supra* \u00b6374) and the Venezuelan Minister of Hydrocarbons on 8 and 14 February 2008. In the first, the Minister said that they were in a negotiating process with ConocoPhillips in spite of having entered into the process of arbitration; currently teams for both countries are establishing the terms to approach a friendly agreement in this dispute.438 In the second statement, a detailed account given in an address to the National Assembly, the Minister said this:\n\nThere are two remaining arbitrations pending, two U.S. multinational corporations. Conoco-Phillips has filed an arbitration against the Republic but unlike Exxonmobil, it has requested and has maintained communications to an extent that makes it possible to reach an amicable solution to our dispute. We are working on that, and, as the Global CEO of Conoco-Phillips expressed in past statements, we are on our way to reaching an agreement.\n\n[...]\n\nAnd we, the Republic, as the United Nations declarations state [the Minister had earlier quoted from General Assembly resolution 1803 (XVII) of 1962], and in the spirit of our legislation, have not refused to indemnify the companies that withdraw from the country, but, of course, we should indemnify the book value of those assets, values that can be fully examined, values that are auditable, values that are transparent, so that there is no possibility whatsoever of a settlement between the parties beyond what is justified.\n\nThis is an action of nationalization, a sovereign act of the Venezuelan State. Accordingly, we are working with Conoco to resolve our controversy in these matters, and are closing the gap between our numbers.439\n\n*Supra* fn. 216.\n\nEx. C-190, Transcript of Speech by Rafael Ramirez before the Venezuelan National Assembly, February 14, 2008.\n\n400.\n\nThe Tribunal does not have before it any evidence at all of the proposals made by Venezuela in this final period. It observes that whatever confidentiality agreement there was has not prevented the submission to it by the Respondent of the ConocoPhillips proposals of June and August 2007. There is no evidence that Venezuela moved from its insistence on book value, a standard confirmed by its Minister\u2019s statement in early 2008 at a point when the arbitration had begun. Nor is there any evidence that in this period, the Venezuelan representatives brought the compensation formulas in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements into the negotiations. Finally, at this stage too there was no proposal for compensation in respect of ConocoPhillips\u2019 assets in the Corocoro Project as Dr Mommer appeared to confirm in cross-examination; he was not re-examined on the course of the negotiations.440\n\nSee. Tr. Day 7:1867.\n\n401.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT, and that the date of the valuation is the date of the Award.\n\n402.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasises that it does not at this stage make a finding in respect of the relevance, if any, of the compensation formulas included in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements to the determination of the quantum of compensation payable in this case. What it does find in respect of those formulas is that they were not, on the evidence before it, brought into the negotiations about compensation, in particular by the Venezuelan authorities.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n403.\n\nThe costs are reserved for consideration at the conclusion of a later phase of this arbitration proceeding and there shall accordingly be no order as to costs at this time.\n\n**IX. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION**\n-------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. It does not have jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Investment Law and accordingly the claims by ConocoPhillips Company are dismissed; and\n\nb. It has jurisdiction under Article 9 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty over:\n\ni. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV, ConocoPhilips Hamaca BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of (1) the increase in the income tax rate which came into effect on 1 January 2007 and (2) the expropriation or migration; and\n\nii. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of the increase in the extraction tax in effect from 24 May 2006.\n\nc. All claims based on a breach of Article 3 of the BIT are rejected.\n\nd. The Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT.\n\ne. The date of valuation of the ConocoPhillips assets is the date of the Award.\n\nf. All other claims based on a breach of Article 6(c) of the BIT are rejected.\n\ng. All other questions, including those concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the parties\u2019 determination are reserved for future determination.\n\nItems (a), (b)(i), (b)(ii), (c), (f) and (g) above have been decided unanimously by the Tribunal.

(EX-R313).\n\n2.\n\nThe Majority rejects this request, for reasons I find wanting; whence this dissenting opinion, as explained below.\n\n3.\n\nThe Majority, after rapidly examining the relevant articles of the ICSID Convention and the Rules of Arbitration, does not find in them any basis for exercising the power needed to reconsider certain of its findings in its Decision of 3 September 2013. In this respect it states :\n\n\"... this Decision is limited to answer the question whether the Tribunal has the power which the Respondent would have it exercised. The Decision does not address the grounds the Respondent invokes for reconsidering the part of the Decision which it challenges and the evidence which it sees as supporting those grounds. The power must be shown to exist before it can be exercised\" (para. 9)\n\n4.\n\nIf the last proposition (that \"power must be shown to exist before it can be exercised\") is correct, the proposition implied in the penultimate sentence (that this can, or rather has to be done in isolation from and prior to addressing the grounds invoked for exercising the power) is not.\n\n5.\n\nThis is because the power we are speaking of here is not a mere undifferentiated entitlement, a right, its holder having the faculty to exercise it or not, for whatever purpose he may have in mind (within certain limits all the same such as the principle of \"abuse of right\").\n\n6.\n\nThe power envisaged here is legal power, translated in the context of a tribunal in terms of jurisdiction to do certain things, in the course of discharging its overall adjudicative function. The empowerment as part of a function, carries with it a duty or obligation to exercise this power to achieve certain specific purposes or to fulfil certain specific legal tasks within the framework of the larger function.\n\n7.\n\nThe existence of the power may thus depend on, and its extent can vary with the specific legal purpose or task for the fulfilment of which the power is provided. The power may thus exist for achieving certain purposes but not for others.\n\n8.\n\nIn other words, as with the ascertainment of jurisdiction in general, a tribunal has to look into the grounds or reasons invoked for the exercise of the power, i.e. the specific legal purpose, task or operation for the fulfilment of which the exercise of power is sought, in order to be able to determine :\n\na - whether *prima facie,* these grounds are possibly applicable to the underlying contended facts, if proven; and, in the affirmative,\n\nb - whether these grounds legally found or justify the exercise of the power requested in that particular case.\n\n9.\n\nIn *casu,* the specific purpose (or legal ground) for which the Tribunal is requested to exercise the power of limited reconsideration of its prior partial Decision of 3 September 2013, while the case is still pending before it, is that of correcting a claimed material error committed by the Tribunal itself in establishing the facts, as well as in the legal conclusions and consequences it drew from or built on these erroneously established facts.\n\n10.\n\nIn order for the Tribunal to be able to respond to the request of reconsideration of which it is seized, the Tribunal has thus, for the reasons explained in paragraph 8 above, to answer the following questions :\n\n1 - Does the Tribunal have before it sufficient elements, or evidence *prima facie* of a possible material error in its establishment of facts; and if the answer is positive,\n\n2 - does the Tribunal have a general power of reconsideration of partial decisions while the case is still pending before it, that cover *inter alia* (or as a specific application) reconsideration on the grounds invoked *in casu,* but if the answer is negative,\n\n3 - does the Tribunal all the same have a specific power of reconsideration covering the particular legal ground invoked *in casu ?*\n\nThese three questions are addressed, in that order below.\n\n**I -** ***Prima facie*** **evidence of the material error committed by the Majority Decision of 3 September 2013 and consequently in the legal conclusions it drew from it**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nIn order to answer the first of the questions set forth in the preceding paragraph, it is necessary first to recall the premises on which the Majority based its findings concerning the issue of negotiations over compensation in the Decision of 3 September 2013. These premises consist mainly of a series of presumptions of fact, drawn from what the Majority considered as valid evidence before it, namely :\n\na - that the offer of compensation made by Venezuela before nationalization, and submitted to the Tribunal by the Claimants, for the two big projects of Petrozuata and Hamaca was derisory and far below the standard required by the BIT (a presumption I need not address here, but which I rebut at length in my dissenting opinion from the 3 September 2013 Majority Decision); and\n\nb - that Venezuela had not budged from that position or made any other offer in the negotiations that preceded or followed the nationalization and continued even after the beginning of this arbitration in November 2007 and which went on well into 2008.\n\n12.\n\nIt is to be noted that the latter part of the negotiations was covered by a Confidentiality agreement which was invoked by both Mr. Goff (Conoco negotiator)2 and Dr. Mommer (Venezuela)3 to abstain from saying anything about negotiations during the latter period in their oral testimony before the Tribunal, apart from Goff saying that it went on for a long time4.\n\nHearingsTr. (day 3) p. 684.\n\nHearingsTr. (day 7) pp. 1857-8\n\nHearingsTr. (day 3) p. 684.\n\n13.\n\nThe Majority Decision thus assumed, without having \"any evidence at all of the proposals made by Venezuela in this final period\"5, that during that period Venezuela had not budged from its initial proposition, inferring from this presumed intransigence that the Respondent did not engage or intend to engage in good faith negotiations over compensation.\n\nDecision of 3 September 2013, para. 400.\n\n14.\n\nThe Majority Decision supports this inference by two arguments :\n\na - the first, already mentioned, is that \"The Tribunal does not have before it any evidence at all of the proposals made by Venezuela in this period\"6. It thus brushes aside and gives no credence at all to the general statements of Dr. Mommer in his written and oral testimonies to the effect that Venezuela was always willing to pay just compensation, attributing the failure of the negotiations to the exaggerated and intransigent demands of the Claimants.\n\nb - The Majority decision also brushes aside any legal significance and effect of the Confidentiality agreement when invoked by Dr. Mommer in his oral testimony to abstain from providing the Tribunal with any information about the course of the negotiations, necessarily including whatever offers made by Venezuela during that period; and this by adding immediately after the first sentence of paragraph 400, quoted above (under a), the following :\n\n\"It [the Tribunal] observes that whatever confidentiality agreement there was has not prevented the submission to it by the Respondent of the ConocoPhillips proposals of June and August 2007\"7.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n15.\n\nIn other words, the Majority Decision is saying that, notwithstanding the Confidentiality agreement, had Venezuela made any reasonable offers during that period that could favour its position *in casu,* it would not have hesitated to put them before the Tribunal, as it did by submitting to the Tribunal the Claimants proposals of June and August 200 7, in violation of that agreement.\n\n16.\n\nThis reasoning (ground, *motif)* of the Majority Decision is revealing in more ways than one. Apart from a general attitude vis-\u00e0-vis the Respondent, it reveals an important *error in the establishment of facts* on the part of the Majority Decision, by assuming that the Confidentiality agreement was in effect in June 2007, while it had on record before it evidence to the contrary. Indeed, the question of the date of entry into force of the Confidentiality agreement was put to Counsel for the Respondent during the oral hearings. His answer was that it did not come into force until November 20078. This answer was neither challenged nor contradicted by the Claimants during the Hearings and was even confirmed by them later on9.\n\nHearingsTr. (day 13) pp. 3705-6.\n\nClaimants\u2019 *Second Submission on Respondent\u2019s Application for Reconsideration* (Claimants\u2019 Second Submission) (25 November 2013) p. 15, para. 15 : \"Given that the Confidentiality agreement did not take effect until the arbitration began... \"\n\n17.\n\nThus, the Majority Decision committed *a material error in establishing the facts.* But worse still, it drew from it by inference, a grave legal consequence : not only that the Respondent has breached its confidentiality obligation by submitting to the Tribunal the Claimants offers of June and August 2007, when that obligation had not yet come into effect; but also, and *ex hypothesi,* that the Respondent would not have hesitated to do the same, i.e. submit to the Tribunal any proposition it would have made during the final period of negotiations, had they existed, in violation of its confidentiality obligation which indeed covered that final period. In other words, the Majority Decision predicated, not on the basis of positive proof, but by divination or sheer fiat, a presumption - drawn from a single misconceived instance involving an error of fact - of a constant pattern of conduct attributable to the Respondent, of not hesitating to violate its obligations whenever it suited its purposes.\n\n18.\n\nAnd through this extraordinary speculative reasoning by hypothesis, extrapolated from an erroneously established fact, the Majority Decision makes another positive finding of fact over something it admitted knowing nothing about, namely the possible offers Venezuela made or did not make during the final period of negotiations, which was indeed covered by the Confidentiality agreement; an agreement that was invoked by witnesses for both parties to justify their refusal to divulge the exchanges and offers made during that period.\n\n19.\n\nThis positive finding of fact that the Respondent did not make any new offer, or rather that it stayed put on its initial position during that final period of negotiations, reached through the extraordinary speculative reasoning described above, is at the basis of the even more serious legal finding that Venezuela had not negotiated in good faith during that final period over compensation.\n\n20.\n\nObviously, if a factual premise on which are based these legal findings - reached by speculative chain reaction reasoning - turns out to be erroneous, the whole edifice crumbles down like a house of card.\n\n21.\n\nThis is exactly the situation *in casu,* as there is no room for doubt, as shown above, that on the basis of the record as it stood at the time of its issue, the Majority Decision of 3 September 2013 committed an error in determining the scope of applicability of the Confidentiality agreement in time, from which it drew by inference equally vitiated legal conclusions and findings.\n\n22.\n\nIt is worth noting in this regard that, in order to reach its conclusions concerning the final period of negotiations, the Majority Decision, having admitted possessing no evidence at all for that period, had to make a leap of faith, encompassing three steps, a) relying almost exclusively and uncritically on the affirmations and representations of the Claimants throughout the proceedings, insisting that they did not receive any offer beyond the initial one concerning the Petrozuata and the Hamaca projects. But in order for this version to prevail, the Majority Decision had to neutralize any contradictory evidence by b) shedding away as lacking credibility the general statements of Dr. Mortimer in his written and oral testimonies that Venezuela was always willing to pay just compensation, and that the negotiations failed because of the intransigent and exaggerated demand of the Claimants; as well as c) denying any legal significance and effect to \"whatever confidentiality agreement there was\"10\n\n*Loc.cit. supra* note 5, para. 400.\n\n23.\n\nThe error committed by the Majority Decision as described above, was easily detectable from the record at the disposal of the Tribunal at the time that Decision was issued. It confounds the third step covered by the leap of faith of the Majority Decision i.e. denying any significance and effect to the Confidentiality agreement. As such, it suffices as an affirmative answer to the first of the three questions set forth in paragraph 10 above, namely whether the Tribunal has before it sufficient elements or evidence *prima facie* of a possible material error in the establishment of facts; i.e. whether there is a valid ground or cause for reconsideration\n\n24.\n\nHowever, with the revelations of the Wikileaks cables submitted to the Tribunal as annexes to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 8 September 2013 (see paragraph 1 above) the ground or cause for reconsideration changes radically in dimension and importance. For, these cables administer a flagrant refutation to the remaining steps - a) and b) - covered by the leap of faith of the Majority Decision.\n\n25.\n\nIndeed, in a cable dated 4 April 2008 and entitled \"ConocoPhillips Briefs Ambassador on Compensation Negotiations\"11, the US Embassy in Caracas reports to Headquarters on a meeting held on that day (4 April 2008) in which \"Greg Goff [the Chief ConocoPhillips negotiator then] and...Roy Lyons...briefed the Ambassador on the state of compensation negotiations with BRV [Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela]\".\n\nEX-R 313, Annex 4\n\n26.\n\nThe cable starts by noting (in paragraph 1) that \"ConocoPhillips (CP) is guardedly optimistic on the state of negotiations on compensation\", and that \"CP and the BRV have reached agreement on the methodology for determining the fair market value of CP\u2019s assets\".\n\n27.\n\nThen (in paragraph 4) it relates Mr. Goff's description of the state and progress of the negotiations and the positions of the parties in them *(pace* the Confidentiality agreement) in the following terms :\n\n\"According to Goff, CP has two basic claims : a claim for compensation for its expropriated assets and a claim based on the progressive expropriation of the underlying assets. Goff stated the BRV has accepted that fair market value is the standard for the first claim. He said the BRV has moved away from using book value as the standard for compensation and has agreed on a fair market methodology with discount rates for computing the compensation for the expropriated assets. However, given the recent increase in oil prices, the fair market value of the assets have increased. As for the claim based on the progressive expropriation of the assets, Goff said the claim was on top of the fair market value of the assets. CP has proposed a settlement number and the BRV appears to be open to it. Goff added that CP also plans on increasing the settlement number for the second claim due to recent increases in oil prices\".\n\n28.\n\nThis description, from the horse\u2019s mouth, clearly reveals\n\n1 - that Venezuela had moved from its initial position on the methodology of evaluating the current market value, from \"book value\" to a \"discounted (cash flow) rate\" methodology;\n\n2 - that ConocoPillips was prosecuting two claims of compensation the first for its expropriated assets and the second for \"progressive expropriations\", i.e. what is sometimes called \"creeping nationalization\", *in casu* changes in the tax and royalty regime. (This latter claim was dismissed by this Tribunal in its Decision of 3 September 2013, as unfounded either in the BIT or in general international law);\n\n3 - that for both claims ConocoPhillips was claiming compensation reflecting automatically any post-nationalization increases in the price of oil.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants did not contest the veracity of the contents of these cables in their two briefs submitted in the present phase of the procedure, though they questioned their relevance and admissibility. Of course, these questions would have constituted one of the first items on the agenda of the \"short concentrated hearing\" requested by the Respondent had the Tribunal acceded to this request.\n\n30.\n\nHowever, the Majority bars the road from the outset to any such examination, arguing, as has been discussed in paragraph 3 above, that \"the power must be shown to exist before it can be exercised\", which prevents the Tribunal, according to the Majority, from examining the grounds invoked by the request and attendant evidence, before the showing of the existence of the power.\n\n31.\n\nThe Majority follows with a very summary, pro-forma examination (in 5 paragraphs) of the question whether or not the Tribunal is possessed in general of the power to reconsider its prior partial decisions in cases still pending before it. It does so by interpreting the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules in a narrow, formal and abstract manner, detached from any context, particularly the grounds invoked for the exercise of the power, not to mention the larger context and the general purposes of all systems of procedure; reaching quickly the conclusion that the Tribunal does not posses such power.\n\n32.\n\nI have explained in paragraphs 4 to 10 above, the reasons why I consider this manner of proceeding wanting. Be that as it may, even if one follows the narrow, formal, method of interpretation of the Majority, a very strong case can be made for an affirmative answer to the question, contrary to that reached by the Majority, as shown below.\n\n**II - Is the Tribunal Possessed of a General Power to Reconsider Its Prior Partial Decisions in Cases still Pending before it ?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe answer to this question turns on whether one considers the Decision of 3 September 2013 \"final\", hence *\"res judicata\",* or not and consequently subject to reconsideration by the Tribunal while the case is pending before it; certain aspects of the merits (particularly the relevance of the compensation clauses in the Association Agreements) and the whole quantum issue being still awaiting consideration.\n\n34.\n\nThe Majority starts by admitting that the Decision of 3 September 2013 is not an \"Award\", in the sense given to the term in the ICSID Convention and that consequently, Article 53 of the Convention that provides in paragraph 1, \"The Award shall be binding on the Parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except for those provided for in the Convention\" (i.e. the binding character and finality that make up *res judicata)* is \"not directly applicable\". But if hastens to add that this \"does not mean that it may not be relevant in a more general sense\" (paragraph. 19); and proceeds to build up an argument purporting to show that the Decision of 3 September 2013 is after all final and binding and bearing *res judicata* authority; a discourse that is critically analysed in what follows.\n\n35.\n\nThe  Majority starts by refuting the Respondent\u2019s characterization of the Decision of 3 September 2013 as \"interim\" or \"preliminary\", stating that \"The Decision does not...take an interim or preliminary form in respect of the matters on which it rules\", reciting as proof different statements of the Decision, in which the Tribunal \"concludes\", \"finds\" or \"decides as follows...\" (paragraph 20).\n\n36.\n\nHowever, the fact that a Tribunal reaches conclusions, makes findings or takes decisions does not mean that they are or make them, by any logical or legal necessity, \"final\" or \"binding\", particularly on the Tribunal itself (if it becomes aware for example that it has committed an error).\n\n37.\n\nThe Majority tries to fill this logical gap with two succinct sentences, namely :\n\n\"1) Those decisions *in accordance with practice* are to be incorporated in the Award.\n\n2) It is *established as a matter of principle and practice* that such decisions that resolve points of dispute between the Parties have *res judicata* effect\"12.\n\nThese assertions call for close scrutiny, as they go to the very nature and specificity of the ICSID procedural system. The first needs to be qualified, whilst the second takes as given what it is supposed to prove.\n\n*Loc.c\u00ect.spra* note 5, para.20. Emphasis added. The Majority concludes with a quote from a recent Decidion of another Tribunal which is addressed in para. below.\n\n38.\n\nRegarding the first of these two assertions, it is to be noted that the incorporation of such interlocutory decisions in the final Award is not only a matter of practice as stated therein. It is a matter of legal necessity and obligation, given the specificity of the procedural system of ICSID. Indeed, Article 48, paragraph 3 of the ICSID Convention provides : \"The award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal...\". In other words, this provision mandates that the award incorporates any conclusions (findings, decisions) on a question submitted to the Tribunal that it would have formulated before the final award.\n\n39.\n\nIf an award is incomplete, in the sense of not integrating earlier decisions on certain questions put to the tribunal, or otherwise omitting to deal with some such questions, it would not correspond (or not as yet) to the substantive definition of the \"award\" in article 48/3 of the Convention. In other words, it would not be the \"final\" award envisaged in that definition; \"final\" being understood not only in its chronological current meaning of \"last\" (though under the ICSID Convention it should also be); but in its technical procedural meaning of \"definitive\", signifying that the Tribunal has deployed and totally discharged its adjudicative function vis-\u00e0-vis the treated matter, putting an end to the dispute before it on that matter, and deseizing the Tribunal of it, except for post-adjudicative tasks (unless otherwise provided).\n\n40.\n\nIf the award cannot be considered final unless and until it incorporates the prior partial decisions - finality being attached to the all-inclusive character of the instrument - these interlocutory partial decisions *a fortiori* cannot be considered final until they are thus incorporated as part of the whole. Nor can they be subject to (i.e. benefit from the status conferred by) article 53, which is the ICSID rendering of the principle of *res judicata,* of which finality is one of the two pillars (together with the binding character on the parties); contrary to the second assertion of the Majority (quoted in paragraph 35 above), on which more later.\n\n41.\n\nFinality is important in another respect as it opens the door to post-judgment remedies, which are in the ICSID system those of articles 50 to 52 of the Convention. But these are available only against \"awards\", to the exclusion of pre-award interlocutory or partial decisions, whether on preliminary objections or certain aspects of the merits; that which comforts the position that these latter decisions are not \"final\" in the technical sense of the term.\n\n42.\n\nThis is a \"peculiarity\" of the ICSID procedural system, singled our by several important authors13, and referred to in some awards. It distinguishes it from most other international procedural systems such as those of the ICJ, the International Criminal Court and Tribunals, the European Court of Human Rights and other international arbitration systems; which means from general international law on the subject. All these systems and rules provide for interlocutory decisions, particularly on preliminary objections, not to mention partial decisions on certain aspects of merits, in the form of final judgments or awards, open to whatever remedies are available in these diverse systems against defective judgments or awards. In other words, the ICSID procedural rules, constitute a *lex specialis* in this regard. The second assertion of the Majority (see paragraph 37 above) is true under general international law and these other systems, but it does not tally with the ICSID *lex specialis.*\n\nE.g. Fouchard, Gaillard & Goldman, *International Commercial Arbitration* (1999), p. 739, from whom the term \"peculiarity\" is borrowed.\n\n43.\n\nIt appears that the rationale or philosophy underlying this peculiarity of the ICSID procedural system14 is to have all the controverted issues of a case resolved in a kind of a package deal; probably to ensure that while deciding in law, a tribunal will have at the back of its mind the total balance of equities.\n\nThis is apart from the dissuasive example of the drawn out proceedings on preliminary objections before the ICJ, which was also invoked during the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires.*\n\n44.\n\nFinality thus comes with the closure of this all inclusive package in the form of an instrument it calls \"award\"; and attaches to the whole as well as to its constitutive parts simultaneously; but only from that moment on. Until that moment, according to the inner logic of this chosen system or *lex specialis,* all the components of the package, whether decided upon or not, remain on the table (or the Bench), amenable to rectification and adjustment by the Tribunal, in order to fit better in, and to perfect as much as possible the final product, which is the package as a whole.\n\n45.\n\nIn this respect, rules of procedure are like the rules of traffic. They can be to the left or to the right, but they have to be consistent. They cannot be to the left for some purposes, uses or users, but at the same time to the right for others. The same applies to a procedural system. It cannot consider interlocutory decisions on preliminary objections or certain aspects of the merits as final for certain purposes such as the prohibition of their reconsideration by the Tribunal; while at the same time considering them non-final when it comes to post-judgment remedies.\n\n46.\n\nThis brings me back to the second assertion of the Majority that \"It is established as a matter of principle and practice that such [interlocutory] decisions that resolve points of dispute between the Parties have *res judicata* effect\". As mentioned above, while this statement sounds true for general international law and its codification in diverse statutes that consider interlocutory judgments final and open to post-judgment remedies, it does not for the ICSID *lex specialis.*\n\n47.\n\nAs a matter of principle, by which I understand \"according to straight legal reasoning and logic\", I submit that the case for the refutation of this assertion, as far as ICSID *lex specialis* is concerned, is sufficiently made above. As for practice, positions are divided. Thus, while some tribunals consider that such interlocutory decisions are \"final\" (see below, paragraph 50), others declare that:\n\n\"the ICSID Arbitration Rules contain no provisions which permit or even contemplate \"Partial\" or \"Interim\" awards, indeed, it seemed to the Tribunal that the Rules contemplated only one, Final Award\"15.\n\n*Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd v. Independent Power Tanzania Ltd.* (ICSID case No. ARB/98/8), Final Award of 22 June 2001, para. 32).\n\n48.\n\nSimilar divisions are found in the writings on the subject. There seems to be a wide consensus that there is only one final decision in the ICSID system, the Award that puts an end of the dispute before the Tribunal. Thus, in a scholarly publication, three senior Counsel for the Claimants *in casu* write :\n\n\"...not all ICSID decisions are awards, let alone final awards. Pursuant to Convention Article 48(3), an award is final if it disposes of all questions put to the tribunal\"16.\n\nThis means by necessary implication that all interlocutory decisions other than the all comprehensive Award, are not final, nor consequently *res judicata.* However, some of those who take the position that only the comprehensive Award is final maintain that interlocutory decisions are not open for reconsideration by the same Tribunal before the award.. A perfect example of blowing hot and cold at the same time, and the telling proof of the fallacy of the thesis of the finality of interlocutory decisions in ICSID as well as the second assertion of the Majority.\n\nLucy Reed, Jan Paulson and Nigel Blackaby, *Guide to ICSID Arbitration,* (2nd ed., Kluwer 2011) p. 182.\n\n49.\n\nAfter making the two assertions reproduced above in paragraph 37 above, the Majority concludes with a quotation from a recent interlocutory Decision of an ICSID tribunal, which describes the \"several decisions and reasons\" on jurisdiction and merits contained therein in the following terms : \"they are intended to be final and not to be revisited by the Parties or the Tribunal in any later phase of these arbitrations proceedings17.\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary,* ICSID case No. ARB 07/19), Decision of 30 November 2012, para. 10.1-\n\n50.\n\nFirst of all, one notes a freudian slip by omission in the quotation by the Majority. Indeed, the original reads : \"[they] are intended *by the Tribunal* to be final...\". That Tribunal was cautious enough not to say, as infers the Majority here, that they are intended by principle and practice, by the drafters of the Convention or by law. That Tribunal limits its intention or contention to itself. And as mentioned before, opinions are divided on that matter.\n\n51.\n\nAll the same, I dare presume, with all due respect to the eminent members of that Tribunal, that if they become aware, before the final award, that they have made a crucial error of fact or of law that led them astray in their findings, or of new evidence or changing circumstances to the same effect, they may not hesitate to revisit their decisions, for reasons further developed below.\n\n**III - Is the Tribunal possessed of a Specific Power Covering the Particular Legal Ground invoked** ***in casu ?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nIn paragraph 32 above, I said that a strong case can be made for the existence of a general power of reconsideration by an ICSID tribunal of its interlocutory decisions (within certain limits or under certain conditions all the same) in a case still pending before it. However, if the answer to the question whether such a power exists or not were to be in the negative, there remains the possibility (alluded to in paragraph 10 above) that the Tribunal possess a specific power for dealing with requests based on a particular or certain particular legal grounds.\n\n53.\n\nThe Majority examines, in paragraph 22, two provisions invoked by the Respondent, article 44 of the Convention and Rule 38/2 of the Arbitration Rules, as possible sources of the power sought, and summarily dismisses them as being of a purely procedural nature. Thus, while admitting that article 44 confers on the tribunals a subsidiary power to fill procedural gaps, \"it cannot be seen [according to the Majority] as conferring a broad unexpressed power of substantive decision\"18. As to Rule 38/2, it is dismissed in one short sentence as having \"a much more limited function\"19.\n\nI concur in general with this statement. But the argument of the Respondent is not that the power emanates from article 44, but that article 44 is needed to provide the modalities of its exercise.\n\nThe Majority avoids even reciting this Rule not to say examining its contents, although (or is it because ?) the \"exceptional circumstance\" or \"ground\" it envisages is exactly that invoked *in casu,* and for which it provides : \"Exceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the award [not any decision] has been rendered, reopen the proceeding [which has not been closed *in casu,* making the Rule *a fortiori* applicable] on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points\". The Majority adds (in para. 23) another reason, apart from their purely procedural nature, to dismiss the relevance of these two provisions, namely that the provisions of the Convention and its overall structure, leave no room for a power gap to be filled; a highly debatable proposition. Anyway, both reasons given by the Majority fall if the interlocutory decisions are not final, hence not *res judicata,* as has been demonstrated above.\n\n54.\n\nArticle 44 is examined by the Majority, however, in the context of establishing whether or not the Tribunal has a general power of reconsideration. But this article is relevant *in casu* in another meaningful way, as a partial codification and specific application of the *inherent jurisdiction or powers* of any judicial or adjudicative organ. A jurisdiction which was first incarnated by and evolved through the development of the general principle of *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* (la competence de la competence), but which transcended this principle, to a much wider ambit, as articulated particularly by the ICJ.\n\n55.\n\nThus, in the *NorthernCameroons* case (1963), the Court refers to \"the duty of the Court to maintain its judicial character\", before adding : \"The Court itself, and not the parties, must be the guardian of the Court\u2019s judicial integrity\"20. Later on, in the *Nuclear Tests* case (1974), the Court gives a fuller rendering of its understanding of the concept:\n\n\"...the Court possesses an inherent jurisdiction enabling it to take such action as may be required, on the one hand to ensure that the exercise of its jurisdiction over the merits, if and when established, shall not be frustrated, and on the other, to provide for the orderly settlement of all matters in dispute, to ensure the observance of the \u2018inherent limitations on the exercise of the judicial function\u2019 of the Court, and to \u2018maintain its judicial character\u2019 (*Northern Cameroons, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1963,at* p. 29). Such inherent jurisdiction, on the basis of which the Court is fully empowered to make whatever findings may be necessary for the purposes just indicated, derives from the mere existence of the Court as a judicial organ established by the consent of States, and is conferred upon it in order that its basic judicial function may be safeguarded\"21.\n\n*ICJRep. 1963,* p. 29.\n\n*ICJRep. 1974,* pp. 259-260, para. 23.\n\n56.\n\nThus, inherent jurisdiction accrues to any body or organ by the mere fact of it being possessed of the adjudicative function. It brings with it powers as well as duties and responsibilities. The powers enable the organ to exercise its principal jurisdiction over the subject-matter (the merits) in a proper, efficient and equitable manner; by asserting the independence of the organ from the parties in the exercise of its function, while drawing its jurisdiction ultimately from their consent, through the principle of *Kompetenz-Kompetenz',* and by allowing the organ to fill procedural gaps, a power often codified in statutory provisions such as article 44 of the ICSID Convention, but which can be exercised even in the absence of such provisions22; as well as all the other powers necessary for the organ to discharge its duties and responsibilities which are part of the inherent jurisdiction. These are \"to maintain its judicial character\", \"safeguard its basic judicial function\" and be \"the guardian of [its] judicial integrity\"; in short to ensure and safeguard the efficiency, credibility and integrity of the adjudicative function and the adjudicative character of the organ, whose first and foremost task is to seek the truth and to dispense justice according to law on that basis.\n\nCf. ConstantinosSalonidis, \u00ab Inherent Powers in ICSID Arbitration \u00bb, *in* 5 *Investment Treaty Arbitration and International* Law(Laird & Weiler, eds. Vew *York, Juris,* 2012, p. 43 at 52 ; \"Arbitral tribunals have typically exercised their powers under Article 44 by declaring that in doing so they are also exercising powers that inhere in their judicial function and status as international tribunals\".\n\n57.\n\nIt is precisely in fulfilling this task and discharging its duty of safeguarding the credibility and integrity of its adjudicative function, that lies the power of a tribunal to reconsider a prior decision whether interlocutory or not, whether it is considered final or not, and whether such a reconsideration is provided for in its statute or not, i.e. regardless of all these distinctions; if the tribunal becomes aware that it had committed an error of law or of fact that led it astray in its conclusions, or in case of new evidence or changed circumstances having the same effect. This was done by a large spectrum of tribunals governed by a wide variety of Statutes (the European Court of Human Rights, ICTY, ICC arbitral tribunals, etc.) on the basis of the inherent jurisdiction of the organ, whether articulated in these terms or simply, \"in the interests of justice\", in order to safeguard the credibility and integrity of the tribunal. A couple of examples suffice.\n\n58.\n\nIn the *Hostages* case (1933) before the US-Germany Mixed Claims Commission, the Umpire, Owen Roberts (deciding on a request for rehearing after final judgment) wrote :\n\n\"I think it clear that where the Commission has misinterpreted the evidence, or made a mistake in calculation, or where its decision does not follow its fact findings, or where in any other respect the decision does not comport with the record as made, or where the decision involves a material error of law, the Commission not only has power, but is under the duty upon a proper showing, to reopen and correct a decision to accord with the facts and the applicable legal rules\"23.\n\n8UNRIAA, p. 160 at 188.\n\n59.\n\nIn the same vein, the European Court of Human Rights, in *Waltraud Storck v. Germany* case, declared :\n\n\"The Court concedes that neither the Convention, nor the Rules of Court expressly provide a reopening of proceedings before the Court. However, in exceptional circumstances, where there has been a manifest error of fact or in the assessment of the relevant admissibility requirements, the Court does have, in the interest of justice, the inherent power to re-open a case which had been declared inadmissible and to rectify those errors\"24.\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Decision on Admissibility, dated 26 October 2004, pp. 13-14.\n\n60.\n\nSimilarly, in doctrine, several authors reach identical conclusions. For example, James Castello, commenting UNCITRAL Rules, wrote :\n\n\"Even though it is often said that a tribunal is *functus officio* with respect to any issue that it has resolved on the merits by partial award, nevertheless - in a few cases - tribunals have held that they may revisit such issues when, for example, they believe a change in circumstances or in the factual record renders the initial award untenable\"25.\n\nJames Castello, \u00ab UNCITRAL Rules \u00bb, *in, Practitioner Handbook on International Commercial Arbitration,* Weigand ed.. OUP, 2010, p.1403, at 1512, para. 16,336. See also Eric Schwartz, \"Thoughts on the Finality of Arbitral Awards\", in *Liber Amicorum en l\u2019Honneur de Serge Lazareff,* L.L\u00e9vy and Y. Derains eds,, Pedone 2011, p. 569 at 576.\n\n61.\n\nIn sum, in certain contingencies which put or risk putting the credibility and integrity of the tribunal into question - such as its becoming aware that it had committed an error in interpreting evidence or in establishing the facts that led it astray in its legal findings; that the decision did not follow from the facts as determined; that new credible evidence demonstrate that the facts as established by the tribunal were based on wrong premises; or that changed circumstances have rendered the decision otherwise untenable - inherent jurisdiction empowers and even mandate the tribunal to reconsider the prior decision.\n\n62.\n\nThe tribunal is called on to act either *proprio motu* or on showing good cause (ground) and credible *prima facie* evidence by a requesting party, at any stage of the proceedings, and even after a final judgment if the tribunal is still in existence, with a view to correcting the error and all the consequences it drew from it.\n\n63.\n\nThis is exactly the situation *in casu;* as there is no doubt that on the basis of the record as it stood at the time of the issue of the Decision of September 3, 2013, the Tribunal committed an error relating to the temporal ambit of the Confidentiality Agreement, from which it drew far reaching conclusions, through speculative *ex hypothesi* reasoning and extrapolation (see paragraphs 12 to 20).\n\n64.\n\nHowever, the revelations of Wikileaks cables change the situation radically in dimension and seriousness. Here we have a full narrative of the negotiations, with a high degree of credibility, given the level of detail that tallies perfectly with what we know of the rest of the record. It is a narrative that radically confutes the one reconstructed by the Majority, relying almost exclusively on the assertions of the Claimants throughout their pleadings that the Respondent did not budge from its initial offer (see paragraphs 24-29 above).\n\n65.\n\nIt reveals, once verified by the Tribunal to be true (but its veracity was not contested by the Claimants, only its relevance and admissibility), that if there was bad faith, it is not attributable to the Respondent, but to the Claimants who misled the Majority by their misrepresentations, in full awareness of their falsity\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\n66.\n\nIn these circumstances, I don\u2019t think that any self-respecting Tribunal that takes seriously its overriding legal and moral task of seeking the truth and dispensing justice according to law on that basis, can pass over such evidence, close its blinkers and proceed to build on its now severely contestable findings, ignoring the existence and the relevance of such glaring evidence.\n\n67.\n\nIt would be shutting itself off by an epistemic closure into a subjective make-believe world of its creation; a virtual reality in order to fend off probable objective reality; a legal comedy of errors on the theatre of the absurd, not to say travesty of justice, that makes mockery not only of ICSID arbitration but of the very idea of adjudication."}], "Content": "Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 2 November 2007, Claimants submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\" **ICSID** \" or \" **the Centre** \") a Request for Arbitration against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\" **Venezuela** \" or \" **the Respondent** \") pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention. On 13 December 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on 23 July 2008. Its members were Judge Kenneth Keith, President, appointed by the Chairman of ICSID Administrative Council pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention; Mr L. Yves Fortier, CC, QC, appointed by the Claimants; and Sir Ian Brownlie, CBE, QC, appointed by the Respondent. On 1 February 2010, the Tribunal was reconstituted, with Professor Georges Abi-Saab being appointed by Respondent, following Sir Ian Brownlie's passing.\n\n3.\n\nOn 3 September 2013, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, concluding as follows:\n\n\"... For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. It does not have jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Investment Law and accordingly the claims by ConocoPhillips Company are dismissed; and\n\nb. It has jurisdiction under Article 9 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty over:\n\ni. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV, ConocoPhilips Hamaca BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of (1) the increase in the income tax rate which came into effect on 1 January 2007 and (2) the expropriation or migration; and\n\nii. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of the increase in the extraction tax in effect from 24 May 2006.\n\nc. All claims based on a breach of Article 3 of the BIT are rejected.\n\nd. The Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT.\n\ne. The date of valuation of the ConocoPhillips assets is the date of the Award.\n\nf. All other claims based on a breach of Article 6(c) of the BIT are rejected.\n\ng. All other questions, including those concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the parties' determination are reserved for future determination.\n\nItems (a), (b)(i), (b)(ii), (c), (f) and (g) above have been decided unanimously by the Tribunal. Items (d) and (e) have been decided by majority, with Arbitrator Georges Abi-Saab, dissenting.\"\n\n4.\n\nOn 8 September 2013, counsel for Respondent submitted a letter requesting a clarification and further explanations from the Tribunal regarding certain findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits (\" **the September 8 letter** \"). In its letter, counsel for Respondent also requested \"a limited and focused hearing\" to address the specific issues raised.\n\n5.\n\nCounsel for the Claimants replied to the September 8 letter on 10 September 2013. Claimants opposed Respondent's requests and proposed instead a briefing schedule for submissions on *quantum*.\n\n6.\n\nOn 11 September 2013, Respondent submitted further comments, to which Claimants replied on 12 September 2013. Additional comments were received from Respondent on 12, 16 and 23 September 2013 and from Claimants on 23 September 2013.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 1 October 2013, the Tribunal fixed a schedule for the parties to file submissions on: (i) the Tribunal's power to reconsider the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 September 2013; and (ii) a possible scheduling for *quantum* briefs.\n\n8.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule, the Parties simultaneously filed briefs on 28 October and 25 November 2013\n\n**B. PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n-------------------------\n\n9.\n\nSo far as the first matter set out in paragraph 7 is concerned, this decision is limited to answering the question whether the Tribunal has the power which the Respondent would have it exercise. The decision does not address the grounds the Respondent invokes for reconsidering the part of the Decision which it challenges and the evidence which it sees as supporting those grounds. The power must be shown to exist before it can be exercised.\n\n10.\n\nThe Parties referred to a number of provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, as well as to commentaries, matters of principle and decisions of various international courts and tribunals. It is convenient to set out the relevant ICSID provisions at this stage:\n\nConvention, **Article 43**\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it deems it necessary at any stage of the proceedings,\n\n(a) call upon the parties to produce documents or other evidence, and\n\n(b) visit the scene connected with the dispute, and conduct such inquiries there as it may deem appropriate.\n\nConvention, **Article 44**\n\nAny arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\n\nConvention, **Article 53**\n\n(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.\n\nEach party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52. Arbitration Rules, **Rule 38(2)**\n\n(2) Exceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, reopen the proceeding on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points.\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent places major emphasis on Article 44 of the Convention and in particular on its second sentence. That provision, it says, recognises the well-established principle that tribunals have inherent powers to make decisions regarding the conduct of proceedings going beyond the specific rules under which they are constituted provided that such decisions do not contradict those specific rules. It quotes a well known commentator: \"An ICSID tribunal's power to close gaps in the rules of procedure is declaratory of the inherent power of any tribunal to resolve procedural questions in the event of *lacunae* \".1 In support of the proposition that under Article 44, or the inherent powers reflected in it, the Tribunal has power to reconsider the Decision, it cited a number of cases. The Tribunal will return to them.\n\n*First Brief of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela Pursuant to the Tribunal's request of October 1, 2013*, of 28 October 2013 \u00b619 (\" **Respondent's First Brief** \"), quoting C. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention, Second Edition (2009), p. 880.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that a tribunal that is still in session can always revise its \"interim\" and \"preliminary\" decisions.2 It sees the Decision as an interim one rendered far before the closure of proceedings. Under article 44 of the Convention, it says, the Tribunal remains free to examine evidence up to the time it renders its award.3\n\n*Second Brief of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela Pursuant to the Tribunal's request of October 1, 2013*, of 25 November 2013 \u00b6\u00b62.13 and 25 (\" **Respondent's Second Brief** \").\n\n*Id.* \u00b625, quoting C. Schreuer *supra* note 1 p. 650.\n\n13.\n\nIn relation to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(2) which enables the tribunal to reopen even a closed proceeding before an award is rendered on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming or certain points must be clarified, the Respondent quotes this passage from the ICSID official commentary:\n\n\"Closure of the proceeding is considered to be without prejudice to the discretionary power of the Tribunal to re-open it on its own initiative or on motion of either party. However, paragraph (2) emphasises the exceptional character of re-opening. Since the new evidence, or the need for clarification, may require both further written and further oral procedures, it is the \u2018proceeding' that may be re-opened.\"4\n\n*ICSID REGULATIONS AND RULES (ICSID 1975), Commentary to Rule 38(2)*, Ex. R-320 to Respondent's First Brief, at footnote 35.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent continues in these terms: \"if an ICSID Tribunal has the power to reopen even a closed proceeding, there can be no question that it has the power to reconsider an interim decision rendered far before the closing of the proceedings.\"5\n\nRespondent's First Brief \u00b618; Respondent's Second Brief \u00b625.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants submit in respect of Article 44 of the Convention that it \"is no licence for a Tribunal to adopt procedures at variance with the ICSID system\"6 and that \"gapfilling cannot be used to overcome an express prohibition in the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\"7 That prohibition is seen as arising from article 53: \"the ordinary meaning of this provision favors the finality of decisions on merit issues\"8. Further, \"when the ICSID Convention provides that there are no appeals, it means that there are no appeals... [T]he limited review that is permissible is reserved for after the final award is issued.\"9 While the Claimants recognised that Article 53 does not explicitly prohibit Parties from appealing decisions rendered in an intermediate phase, that does not mean that there is a \"gap\" in the rules to be filed using Article 44. \"There is an outright prohibition that Venezuela seeks to elide.\"10\n\nClaimants' *Submission on Respondent's Application for Reconsideration of the Decision on Jurisdiction and the* *Merits and Suspension of the Quantum Proceedings* of 28 October 2013 (\" **Claimants' First Brief** \") \u00b69.\n\nClaimants' First Brief \u00b64.\n\n*Id.* \u00b610.\n\n*Id.* \u00b611.\n\n*Id.* \u00b613.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants next submit that to grant the Respondent the relief it seeks would treat the Parties unequally. For instance, had the Respondent prevailed on jurisdiction or the merits, the Tribunal would have issued an award dismissing the claim and the Claimants would have had no right of appeal.11\n\n*Id.* \u00b614.\n\n17.\n\nFurther, the Claimants submit that the Respondent's analogy to the power to reopen under Rule 38(2) is groundless; the stage which that provision refers to has passed: the Tribunal has rendered a decision resolving the merits issues submitted to it.12\n\n*Id.* \u00b615.\n\n18.\n\nBy contrast to the Respondent's characterisation of the decision as interim or preliminary, the Claimants see it as having res judicata effect and challengeable only through the post award remedies provided for in Articles 49 to 52 of the Convention.13 It points out that the relief the Respondent is seeking is unprecedented in ICSID practice.14 The ICSID system, they say, \"forbids appeal entirely, and restricts even the extraordinary review mechanisms provided for in the Convention until after a final award is issued.\"15 It provides this background:\n\nThat is not the result of accident or oversight. Unlike other systems of international arbitration, the drafters of the Convention consciously chose to permit only one instrument called an award and to defer any remedies until after its issuance.\n\nThe Convention's drafters expressly contemplated, for example, that Tribunals could issue decisions on jurisdictions prior to the award. They just as consciously rejected proposals to permit applications for the annulment or challenge of jurisdictional decisions. Among the reasons for this deliberate choice was to avoid the \"unfortunate\" circumstance of \"open[ing] endless possibilities of one Party to frustrate or delay the proceedings\". Thus decisions - be they on jurisdiction or the merits - are meant finally to settle a subset of issues that are later incorporated in the final award, and may then, and only then, be subject to review as part of the award.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe drafters of the Convention themselves stressed \"[T]he binding character of any decision by [an arbitral tribunal] on preliminary questions or merits.\"16\n\nClaimants' *Second Submission on Respondent's Application for Reconsideration of the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, and Suspension of the Quantum Proceedings* \u00b64 (\" **Claimants' Second Brief** \").\n\n*Id.* \u00b69 and footnote 6.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.* \u00b6\u00b610-12, **CL-269**, *History of The ICSID Convention*, Volume II-1, at 408 (1968).\n\n**C. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with the elements of the question which it is to answer. The question relates to the \"Decision of 3 September 2013\". It does not relate to an award, which, in terms of the Convention, is the form of the decision reached at the end of the whole proceeding; as the second issue put to the Parties in the letter of October 1, 2013 confirms, the proceeding has still to reach that stage. Accordingly, the provisions of Article 53 of the Convention, within a Section headed *Recognition and Enforcement of the Award*, which provides that \"[T]he Award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except for those provided for in the Convention\", are not directly applicable. There are the further points that what the Respondent is seeking is not an \"appeal\" but a \"reconsideration\" and not by a distinct appeal body, but by the original tribunal. While those points may also indicate that Article 53 is inapplicable, given the limited meaning of the word \"Award\" in the Convention, the Tribunal need not address them. But the fact that Article 53 and other provisions in Section 5 of Part IV of the Convention do not apply in a direct sense does not mean that it may not be relevant in a more general sense. The Tribunal will return to that matter.\n\n20.\n\nAs noted, the Respondent characterises the Decision as \"interim\" or \"preliminary\" and, accordingly, capable of being reconsidered, perhaps on an informal basis. The only reason suggested in its submissions is the temporal one: a further stage in the proceedings, relating to *quantum*, remains. The Decision does not however take an interim or preliminary form in respect of the matters on which it rules. To the contrary, the Tribunal:\n\n(i) in paragraph 262 \"concludes that it does not have jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Investment Law\"; one consequence is that it does not have jurisdiction over certain tax matters (para. 263);\n\n(ii) in paragraphs 281, 286 and 289 finds that certain objections to jurisdiction under the BIT fail (see also para. 290);\n\n(iii) in paragraph 332 \"concludes\" that certain measures do not fall within the scope of Article 3 of the BIT;\n\n(iv) in paragraph 343 \"concludes\" that if the taking was unlawful, the date of valuation is in general the date of the Award;\n\n(v) in paragraph 352 finds that the part of the claim based on \"undertakings\" fails;\n\n(vi) in paragraph 359 finds that the single taking contention fails;\n\n(vii) in paragraph 401 concludes that the Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith on the basis of market value.\n\nUnder the heading **The Tribunal's Decision**, paragraph 404 begins with these words.\n\n\"For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:...\"\n\nThe paragraph then lists seven matters, including those listed above.\n\n21.\n\nThose decisions in accordance with practice are to be incorporated in the Award. It is established as a matter of principle and practice that such decisions that resolve points in dispute between the Parties have *res judicata* effect. \"They are intended to be final and not to be revisited by the Parties or the Tribunal in any later phase of their arbitration proceedings.\"17\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB 07/19), Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability of 30 November 2012 \u00b610.1\n\n22.\n\nDo the provisions of the Convention and Rules to which the Respondent referred make any difference to that position? The Tribunal does not think so, for two reasons. The first is that those provisions are about procedural matters. Article 44 of the ICSID Convention makes explicit the tribunal's powers to address procedural issues not dealt with in the Convention or the Rules. And ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(2) has a much more limited function. Their essentially procedural character appears from the cases on which the Respondent relied. Those concerning Article 44 were about stay, allowing *amicus curiae* submissions and participation of counsel.18 Article 44, it is frequently said, is designed to enable gaps in the procedure to be filled. It cannot be seen as conferring a broad unexpressed power of substantive decision.\n\nRespondent's First Brief, footnotes 42 and 43\n\n23.\n\nThat gap filling character of the provision relates to the second reason for the Tribunal's conclusion that those procedural provisions cannot be the source of a power to reconsider. The overall structure and the detailed provisions of the ICSID Convention were plainly designed to provide for review or actions in respect of decisions of a tribunal only once the Award was rendered. There is no gap to be filled by the power proposed here. Section 3 of Part IV of the ICSID Convention sets out the Powers and Functions of the Tribunal, with nothing among its provisions even hinting at such a power. Section 4 deals succinctly with the Award itself. And it is only in Section 5 that powers are conferred on the Tribunal to interpret and revise the Award and on an *ad hoc* Committee to annul an Award on prescribed grounds. It is in those ways and those alone that decisions such as that in September 2013 can be questioned, changed or set aside. Those various post-award remedies are, of course, available to both Parties. Those provisions and that structure exclude the possibility of the proposed powers of reconsideration being read into the Convention. That reading of the Convention is also supported by the drafting history mentioned above (paragraph 18).\n\n**D. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n24.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that it does not have the power to reconsider the Decision of 3 September 2013, with Professor Georges Abi-Saab dissenting.\n\n25.\n\nThe following schedule for *quantum* briefs is fixed:\n\na. The Claimants shall file a Memorial on *Quantum* (including all supporting evidence and legal authorities) within ten (10) weeks from the date of the present Decision;\n\nb. Respondent shall file a Counter-Memorial on *Quantum* within ten (10) weeks from their receipt of Claimants' full Memorial on *Quantum* (including all supporting evidence and legal authorities);\n\nc. Claimants shall file a Reply on **Quantum** within four (4) weeks from their receipt of Respondent's full Counter- Memorial on **Quantum** (including all supporting evidence and legal authorities); and\n\nd. Respondent shall file a Rejoinder on **Quantum** within four (4) weeks from their receipt of Claimants' full Reply on **Quantum** (including all supporting evidence and legal authorities).\n\ne. The Tribunal will fix a date for a hearing on *quantum*, in consultation with the parties, in due course.\n\n26.\n\nCosts are reserved for future determination."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2014-05-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimants are ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V., three companies incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands (jointly, \"**ConocoPhillips\"** or \"**the Claimants**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"**Venezuela**\" or the \"**Respondent**\").\n\n**B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn November 2, 2007, the Claimants submitted a Request for Arbitration against Venezuela to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention. On December 13, 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on July 23, 2008. Its members were Judge Kenneth Keith, a national of New Zealand, appointed as president pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention; Mr L. Yves Fortier, CC, QC, a national of Canada appointed by the Claimants; and Sir Ian Brownlie, CBE, QC, a national of the United Kingdom, appointed by the Respondent. On February 1, 2010, the Tribunal was reconstituted, with Professor Georges Abi-Saab, an Egyptian national, being appointed by the Respondent, following Sir Ian Brownlie's passing.\n\n5.\n\nOn September 3, 2013, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits (\"**Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits**\"). It found the Respondent in breach of its international obligation to negotiate compensation in good faith for its taking of ConocoPhillips' assets in three oil projects in Venezuela, and rejected all other claims submitted by the Claimants. Professor Abi-Saab dissented from this Decision, but he has not yet provided the text of his dissent.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 8, 2013, the Respondent requested a clarification and further explanations from the Tribunal regarding certain findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits (\"**the****September 8 letter**\"). In its letter, the Respondent also requested \"a limited and focused hearing\" to address the issues raised.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of September 10, 2013, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's requests and instead proposed a briefing schedule for submissions on *quantum*. The parties exchanged further correspondence on the matter on September 11, 12, 16 and 23, 2013.\n\n8.\n\nOn October 1, 2013, the Tribunal fixed a schedule for the parties to file written submissions on: (i) the Tribunal's power to reconsider the Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits; and (ii) a possible schedule for quantum briefs. In accordance with the schedule, the parties simultaneously filed briefs on October 28 and November 25, 2013.\n\n9.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, the Tribunal issued a majority decision rejecting Respondent's Request for Reconsideration (the \"**Decision on Reconsideration**\"). Professor Abi-Saab appended a Dissenting Opinion.\n\n10.\n\nOn March 11, 2014, Venezuela proposed the disqualification (the \"**Proposal**\") of Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier (the \"**Challenged Arbitrators**\") \"on grounds of lack of the requisite impartiality under Article 14 of the ICSID Convention.\"\n\n11.\n\nOn March 13, 2014, the Centre informed the parties that the proceeding was suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Centre also established a procedural calendar for the parties' submissions on the Proposal.\n\n12.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural calendar, the Respondent submitted a brief with its arguments on the disqualification proposal on March 21, 2014. The Claimants submitted a Reply to the Respondent's disqualification proposal on March 28, 2014.\n\n13.\n\nOn March 30, 2014, the Respondent submitted a letter commenting on the Claimants' Reply to the Respondent's disqualification proposal and asking several questions to the challenged arbitrators. On March 31, 2014, the Claimants replied to Respondent's March 30 letter.\n\n14.\n\nOn April 4, 2014, Mr. Fortier furnished explanations pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). On that same date, Judge Keith declined to furnish explanations, also in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).\n\n15.\n\nAs scheduled, both parties submitted additional comments on the Proposal on April 14, 2014.\n\n**C. PARTIES' ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE PROPOSAL TO DISQUALIFY JUDGE KEITH AND MR. FORTIER AND THE ARBITRATORS' EXPLANATIONS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Venezuela's Proposal for Disqualification**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nVenezuela's arguments on the proposal to disqualify Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier were set forth in its submissions of March 21 and April 14, 2014 and supplemented by its communication of March 30, 2014. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n17.\n\nVenezuela bases the challenge to Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier on \"their steadfast refusal to entertain an application for reconsideration of the [Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits] on an important issue that they decided based on what has been proven beyond doubt to be false premises and their negative 'general attitude vis-\u00e1-vis the Respondent,' their propensity to decide by 'sheer fiat,' their adoption of 'a presumption... of a constant pattern of conduct attributable to the Respondent, of not hesitating to violate its obligations whenever it suited its purposes,' and their 'relying almost exclusively and uncritically on the affirmations and representations of the Claimants throughout the proceedings [which] have evinced a lack of the requisite impartiality under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"1\n\nMemorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators of March 21, 2014 \u00b63.\n\n18.\n\nVenezuela claims that the finding in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits that the Respondent failed to negotiate compensation for the 2007 oil nationalization in good faith was based on improper inferences drawn from false factual premises, and it was manufactured by the Challenged Arbitrators as the Claimants never accused Respondent of bad faith negotiation..2\n\nMemorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators \u00b65. Respondent's Second Submission of April 14, 2014 (\"**Respondent's Second Submission**\") page 5.\n\n19.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Challenged Arbitrators inferred that the Claimants' allegations concerning the compensation negotiations were true because the Respondent did not present evidence of what had occurred during the critical negotiating period. Venezuela further claims that the Challenged Arbitrators ignored the Confidentiality Agreement between the parties to the compensation negotiations, because Respondent had commented on earlier negotiations. Therefore, the Challenged Arbitrators assumed that Venezuela did not feel bound by the Confidentiality Agreement and should have provided additional evidence. Venezuela states that \"while as a matter of law it is never appropriate to infer bad faith negotiation on the part of the State, as a matter of logic the Challenged Arbitrators were obviously wrong in drawing an inference from the purported lack of evidence in this case.\"3\n\nMemorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators \u00b69.\n\n20.\n\nVenezuela also refers to U.S. Embassy cables - part of the WikiLeaks released after the hearing on the merits held in 2010 - submitted by the Respondent with the September 8 letter, to demonstrate that the Claimants made misrepresentations of fact at the hearing that proved decisive to the Challenged Arbitrators.4 Venezuela claims that these cables prove that the Claimants made false representations to the Tribunal, upon which the decision of the Challenged Arbitrators on the lack of good faith negotiation was based.5\n\nMemorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators \u00b610.\n\nMemorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators \u00b611.\n\n21.\n\nVenezuela asserts that a decision based on misrepresentations would not comport with basic principles concerning the administration of justice and could not be made by arbitrators having the requisite impartiality under the ICSID Convention.6 Venezuela adds that \"no legal system can endorse the position that an arbitrator has no power in a case still pending before him to rectify an obvious mistake, irrespective of whether its original opinion was based on misrepresentation, fraud, forged documents, false testimony or any other egregious misconduct\" and that \"this is the effect of the Challenged Arbitrator's blanket refusal to even consider the facts on Respondent's Application for Reconsideration.\"7\n\nMemorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators \u00b616.\n\nRespondent's Second Submission page 5.\n\n22.\n\nVenezuela maintains that the Challenged Arbitrators did not seriously entertain Respondent's application for reconsideration, refused to engage in any analysis of the facts, reached their conclusions in the Reconsideration Decision without addressing the arguments made or authorities cited by the Respondent, and refused to hold the hearing requested by the Respondent. It submits that this conduct evidences \"an unwavering determination by the Challenged Arbitrators to maintain their finding no matter what the circumstances and no matter how erroneous the finding may be.8\n\nMemorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators \u00b635-36. Respondent's Second Submission page 5.\n\n23.\n\nVenezuela maintains that this challenge involves more than the \"mere existence of an adverse ruling,\" and that \"although mere mistakes of procedure or law normally do not constitute sufficient proof of an arbitrator's bias, there is a widely-recognized exception for 'particularly serious or recurring errors, which would constitute a blatant breach of his obligations.\" In Venezuela's submission \"this case involves a decision of the Challenged Arbitrators on a fundamental issue that directly and dispositively affects liability, coupled with a steadfast refusal by the Challenged Arbitrators to even consider the facts establishing that their decision was based upon false factual premises and misrepresentations of a party, an untenable position for any arbitrator to take. To the best of Respondent's knowledge, no proposal of this kind has ever been presented to ICSID.\"9\n\nMemorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators \u00b647 and footnote 73.\n\n24.\n\nVenezuela also maintains that an impartial arbitrator cannot ignore the facts and circumstances of a case and that a tribunal cannot refuse to review its own decision where it is demonstrated to be based on patently false factual premises and misrepresentations. It submits this is particularly evident where the case is still pending before the tribunal with an entire phase left to unfold, \"a phase that will be based on and infected by the very decision that was founded upon those patently false premises and misrepresentations.\"10 Venezuela adds that the issue here is whether the manner in which the Challenged Arbitrators approached Venezuela's Application for Reconsideration creates the appearance of a lack of the requisite impartiality.11\n\nMemorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators \u00b650. Respondent's Second Submission page 4.\n\nRespondent's Second Submission page 3.\n\n25.\n\nVenezuela maintains that it is not asking the Chairman to determine the merits of the case, but only the merits of the challenge and it requests an oral hearing on this matter before the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.12\n\nMemorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators \u00b652; Respondent's Second Submission pages 2 and 7.\n\n26.\n\nFinally, Venezuela submits that Judge Keith's and Mr. Fortier's communications of April 4, 2014 do not address the issues raised in its submissions or in its March 30 letter.13\n\nRespondent's Second Submission page 1.\n\n**2. Claimants' Observations**\n------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants' arguments on the proposal to disqualify Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier were set forth in their submissions of March 28 and April 14, 2014, supplemented by their communication of March 31, 2014. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Proposal is patently frivolous and that it is part of a series of meritless and desperate delaying tactics by Venezuela.14 The Claimants maintain that Venezuela, while disagreeing with some of the factual and legal conclusions reached by the Challenged Arbitrators, has failed to show bias or misconduct on their part.15 The Claimants add that the Proposal is \"founded on nothing more than the Respondent's unhappiness with the Procedural Decision.\"16\n\nClaimants Reply to Respondent's Proposal to disqualify Judge Kenneth Keith and Maitre L. Yves Fortier of March 28, 2014 (\"**Claimant's Reply**\") \u00b61.\n\nClaimant's Reply \u00b62.\n\nClaimant's Reply \u00b610.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants note that Venezuela is not challenging the independence of the Challenged Arbitrators but their impartiality, claiming that Venezuela's allegations fall far short of satisfying that ground for disqualification.17\n\nClaimant's Reply \u00b616.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants argue that this challenge is precluded by well-established principles and the fact that the Majority ruled against Venezuela in a reasoned decision, after deliberation, cannot give rise to a successful challenge.18 The Claimants allege that \"it is unquestionable that [in the Reconsideration Decision] the Majority considered the parties' arguments and reached a reasoned decision on the basis of those arguments. There is no evidence to support the accusation that the resulting decision evinced any degree of partiality. A fortiori, an objective third party could not conclude in these circumstances that the Majority's finding demonstrated a 'manifest lack' of impartiality towards the Respondent.\"19\n\nClaimant's Reply \u00b6\u00b616, 22.\n\nClaimant's Reply \u00b628.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the failure to hold the oral hearing requested by Venezuela does not establish manifest lack of impartiality by the Challenged Arbitrators.20\n\nClaimant's Reply \u00b629.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent is postulating a \"non-existent challenge standard of 'particularly serious or recurring errors' of procedure or law\" as the basis to uphold this challenge.21\n\nClaimant's Reply \u00b619.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants state that the Chairman of the Administrative Council is \"neither in a position to, nor mandated to, scour the factual record to determine, for example, what the WikiLeaks cables should be understood to mean, or whether the Majority relied more heavily on the witness testimony offered by one party. And that is precisely why evidence of arbitrator bias must be 'obvious' and 'discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis.' Were it otherwise, arbitrator challenges would turn into full blown legal and evidential appeals - a result antithetical to the ICSID system, but precisely what the Respondent is attempting to manufacture here.\"22\n\nClaimant's Reply \u00b621.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants refute Venezuela's contention that the majority had reached its Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits as a result of certain misapprehensions. The Claimants state that they have consistently disputed the allegation that the Tribunal's finding of an illegal expropriation was based on a misapprehension and have refuted Venezuela's contention that the facts not contested by the Claimants were undisputed. The Claimants argue that the Respondent is now seeking to transform their explicit and principled stance \"into a form of unspoken acquiescence, referring wishfully to the supposedly undisputed fact that the arbitrators erred.\"23\n\nClaimant's Reply \u00b632.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they placed the issues of illegality of the expropriation and good-faith negotiations before the Tribunal and that these points were argued in multiple rounds.24\n\nClaimant's Reply \u00b634.\n\n36.\n\nFinally, the Claimants maintain that Venezuela's assertions concerning the Confidentiality Agreement and the WikiLeaks cables are legally irrelevant, as they pertain to the period after the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration.25\n\nClaimant's Reply \u00b636.\n\n**3. Arbitrators' Explanations**\n--------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nBy communications of April 4, 2014, Judge Keith advised that he did not wish to furnish any explanations on the Proposal and Mr. Fortier declared the following:\n\n*Having read carefully the parties' submissions of 21 March and 28 March respectively, I believe that you have been well and sufficiently briefed. Accordingly, today, I only offer the following comments.*\n\n*For more than 10 years now, I have been practicing law exclusively as an arbitrator. I consider arbitration a very noble profession and I am extremely proud to be a member of that profession.*\n\n*When I ceased, after many years at the Bar, to act as counsel, I no longer represented clients. I became an adjudicator who, whether as party appointed or chairman of arbitral tribunals, had no case to win or lose. I pledged to myself that I would always be independent and impartial and decide all cases submitted to tribunals on which I sat strictly on the basis of the factual evidence and the applicable law. I am convinced that I have always honored my pledge.*\n\n*The present case is no exception.*\n\n**D. DECISION BY THE CHAIRMAN**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. Timeliness**\n-----------------\n\n38.\n\nArbitration Rule 9(1) reads as follows:\n\n*A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.*\n\n39.\n\nAs the ICSID Convention and Rules do not specify a number of days within which a proposal for disqualification must be filed, the timeliness of a proposal must be determined on a case-by-case basis.26\n\nSee *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a (December 13, 2013) \u00b673 (\"**Burlington**\"); *Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal (February 4, 2014) \u00b668 (\"**Abaclat**\").\n\n40.\n\nIn this case, Venezuela filed the Proposal on March 11, 2014. It arose from a March 10, 2014 Tribunal ruling on Venezuela's request for reconsideration of the September 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits. This disqualification proposal was filed promptly for the purposes of ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n**2. Request for Oral Hearing before the Chairman**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nArticle 58 of the ICSID Convention states that the decision on any proposal to disqualify the majority of arbitrators shall be taken by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent requested that the Chairman of the Administrative Council hold a hearing on the Proposal.27 The Claimants have not advanced a position in this regard.\n\nMemorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators \u00b652; Respondent's Second Submission page 7.\n\n43.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Chairman has discretion to determine the procedure that will be followed in deciding a disqualification proposal before him. The sole procedural guidance in the Rules is that the Chairman shall use his best efforts to take the decision within thirty days after he has received the proposal.\n\n44.\n\nThe Chairman notes that the parties have been given a full opportunity to argue their positions with respect to the Proposal. The parties have comprehensively briefed the Chairman on the relevant facts and law and an oral hearing is not necessary in these circumstances.\n\n45.\n\nAccordingly, the Chairman has decided the Proposal on the basis of the written submissions presented by the parties and the explanations provided by the Challenged Arbitrators, as required by Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules.\n\n**3. Merits**\n-------------\n\n46.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n*A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.*\n\n47.\n\nA number of decisions have concluded that the word \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the Convention means \"evident\" or \"obvious,\"28 and that it relates to the ease with which the alleged lack of the required qualities can be perceived.29\n\n*Burlington supra* note 26 \u00b668, footnote 83; *Abaclat* supra note 26 \u00b671, footnote 25; *Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20), Decision on the Parties' Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal (November 12, 2013) \u00b661, footnote 43 (\"**Blue Bank**\"); *Repsol, S.A. and Repsol Butano, S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/38), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal (December 13, 2013) \u00b673, footnote 58 (\"**Repsol**\").\n\nC. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention, Second Edition (2009), page 1202 \u00b6\u00b6134-154.\n\n48.\n\nThe disqualification proposed in this case alleges that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier manifestly lack the impartiality required by Article 14(1).\n\n49.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.*\n\n50.\n\nWhile the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to \"*independent judgment*,\" and the French version to \"*toute garantie d'ind\u00e9pendance dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions*\" (guaranteed independence in exercising their functions), the Spanish version requires \"*imparcialidad de juicio*\" (impartiality of judgment). Given that all three versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both impartial and independent.30\n\nThe parties agree on this point: Memorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrators \u00b644.

Independence is characterized by the absence of external control. Independence and impartiality both \"protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case.\"31\n\n*Burlington supra* note 26 \u00b666; *Abaclat supra* note 26 \u00b675; *Blue Bank supra* note 28 \u00b659; *Repsol supra* note 28 \u00b671.\n\n52.\n\nArticles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather, it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.32\n\n*Burlington supra* note 26 \u00b666; *Abaclat supra* note 26 \u00b676; *Blue Bank supra* note 28 \u00b659; *Repsol supra* note 28 \u00b671.\n\n53.\n\nThe legal standard applied to a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator is an \"objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.\" As a consequence, the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.33\n\n*Burlington supra* note 26 \u00b667, *Abaclat supra* note 26 \u00b677; *Blue Bank supra* note 28 \u00b660, *Repsol supra* note 28 \u00b672.\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent is dissatisfied with the majority's Decision on Reconsideration and with the procedure that led to it, in particular, the Tribunal's failure to convene an oral hearing on the request for reconsideration.\n\n55.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal adopted a reasonable procedure that was within its discretion to regulate the conduct of the proceeding. Similarly, there is nothing in the reasoning or conclusions of the Decision on Reconsideration that suggests an absence of impartiality.\n\n56.\n\nIn the Chairman's view, a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the facts in this case, would not conclude that they indicate a manifest lack of the qualities required under Articles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, the disqualification proposal must be rejected.\n\n**E.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn November 2, 2007, the Claimants submitted a Request for Arbitration against Venezuela to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention. On December 13, 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on July 23, 2008. Its members were Judge Kenneth Keith, a national of New Zealand, appointed as President pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention; Mr. L. Yves Fortier, a national of Canada, appointed by the Claimants; and Sir Ian Brownlie, a national of the United Kingdom, appointed by the Respondent. The Tribunal was reconstituted on February 1, 2010, with Prof. Georges Abi-Saab, a national of Egypt, appointed by the Respondent following Sir Ian Brownlie's death.\n\n5.\n\nOn October 5, 2011, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier following his disclosure that Norton Rose OR LLP (\"**Norton Rose**\"), the law firm in which he was then a partner, proposed to merge with Macleod Dixon LLP, effective January 1, 2012 (\"**First Proposal for Disqualification**\"). On October 18, 2011, Mr. Fortier submitted a disclosure (the \"**October 2011 disclosure**\") in which he informed Judge Keith, Prof. Abi-Saab and the parties that he was resigning from Norton Rose to establish his own arbitration practice.\n\n6.\n\nEach party filed written submissions addressing the First Proposal for Disqualification and Mr. Fortier furnished explanations as envisaged by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). Judge Keith and Prof. Abi-Saab rejected the First Proposal for Disqualification on February 27, 2012 (\"**Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L. Yves Fortier, QC, Arbitrator**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn September 3, 2013, the Tribunal issued a majority **Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits**. It found the Respondent in breach of its international obligation to negotiate compensation in good faith for its taking of ConocoPhillips' assets in three oil projects in Venezuela. The Tribunal rejected all other claims submitted by the Claimants. Prof. Abi-Saab dissented from this Decision, but did not provide the text of his dissenting opinion to the ICSID Secretariat until February 19, 2015 (\"**Prof. Abi-Saab's** **Dissenting Opinion** **of February 19, 2015**\").1\n\nSee \u00b616 *infra.*\n\n8.\n\nOn September 8, 2013, the Respondent requested a clarification and further explanations from the Tribunal regarding certain findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits. On October 1, 2013, the Tribunal fixed a schedule for written submissions on this request and the parties simultaneously filed briefs on October 28 and November 25, 2013.\n\n9.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, the Tribunal issued a majority decision rejecting the Respondent's request for clarification and further explanations (\"**Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration**\"). Prof. Abi-Saab appended a dissenting opinion to the Decision on the Respondents' Request for Reconsideration (\"**Prof. Abi-Saab's** **Dissenting Opinion** **of March 10, 2014**\").\n\n10.\n\nOn March 11, 2014, Venezuela proposed the disqualification of Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier based on their alleged general attitude toward the Respondent (\"**Second Proposal for Disqualification**\"). The parties filed written submissions and Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier furnished explanations. On May 5, 2014, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council rejected the Respondent's Second Proposal for Disqualification (\"**Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal**\").\n\n11.\n\nOn May 19, 2014, the Claimants submitted their Memorial on Quantum of damages. On August 18, 2014, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on Quantum. On October 13, 2014, the Claimants submitted their Reply on Quantum and on January 7, 2015, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Quantum. A hearing on quantum was scheduled to be held in Washington D.C. in the week of April 13, 2015.\n\n12.\n\nOn January 29, 2015, the Respondent sent the Tribunal two articles published in Global Arbitration Review on January 27, 2015. These articles highlighted the participation of Mr. Martin J. Valasek, a Norton Rose partner, as the tribunal assistant in the Yukos v. Russian Federation arbitrations (the \"**Yukos arbitrations**\") presided over by Mr. Fortier. The Respondent asked Mr. Fortier to provide further explanations as to the extent of his relationship with Norton Rose since January 1, 2012.\n\n13.\n\nMr. Fortier replied to Respondent's request on February 3, 2015, as follows:\n\n*[I] have seen your letter of 29 January 2015 addressed to all members of this ICSID Tribunal.*\n\n*Nothing has changed since 31 December 2011 when I resigned as a partner of Norton Rose OR LLP. I ceased then to have any professional relationship with the firm (now Norton Rose Fulbright).*\n\n*As I wrote to my co-arbitrators on 18 October 2011, there were then members of Norton Rose OR LLP who assisted me in certain files in which I served as an arbitrator (principally as Chairman) and whom I have continued to call upon for assistance after 1 January 2012.*\n\n*Since 1 January 2012, I have pursued my career independently as an arbitrator and mediator in premises which I lease from Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge at Suite 2822 at Place Ville Marie in Montreal. I am also a door tenant at 20 Essex Street in London and arbitrator-member of Arbitration Place in Toronto.*\n\n14.\n\nOn February 6, 2015, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier, alleging that he had an ongoing relationship with Norton Rose which demonstrated his lack of independence and impartiality in this case (\"**Proposal**\"). On the same date, the Centre informed the parties that the proceeding was suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n15.\n\nOn February 9, 2015, the Claimants replied to the Respondent's Proposal. On February 10, 2015, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimants' Reply and on February 12, 2015, the Claimants replied to the Respondent's February 10 comments. On February 13, 2015, Mr. Fortier furnished explanations on the Proposal pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). Both parties submitted additional comments on the Proposal on February 16, 2015.\n\n16.\n\nOn February 19, 2015, Prof. Abi-Saab submitted the text of his Dissenting Opinion on the 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits to the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n17.\n\nOn February 20, 2015, Prof. Abi-Saab submitted his resignation from the Tribunal with immediate effect. Copies of Prof. Abi-Saab's Dissenting Opinion and Letter of Resignation were transmitted to the parties, Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier on that same date.\n\n18.\n\nAt the time of Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation, he and Judge Keith had not yet decided the Respondent's pending proposal to disqualify Mr. Fortier.\n\n19.\n\nOn February 21, 2015, following Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation, the Claimants asked ICSID to submit the proposal for disqualification to the Chairman of the Administrative Council for decision. In addition, the Claimants inquired whether the Tribunal had consented to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation for purposes of Article 56 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent opposed these requests by email of February 23, 2015, indicating that it expected to appoint a replacement arbitrator within 30 days. On the same day, the parties were invited to simultaneously file observations concerning Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation by February 24, 2015. The Respondent replied, asking the Centre to explain the purpose and basis of this invitation.\n\n21.\n\nOn February 24, 2015, the parties were advised that the invitation to comment on Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation sought to ensure that both parties were offered an equal opportunity to state their views on this matter and that the President of the Tribunal considered that such observations could assist the Tribunal. The parties were asked to submit any such observations by noon on February 25, 2015. The Respondent replied by email on February 24, 2015, reiterating its view that there was no basis for the parties to comment on this matter.\n\n22.\n\nOn February 25, 2015, both parties submitted their position concerning Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation.\n\n23.\n\nBy email of February 26, 2015, the Respondent requested an opportunity to respond to the Claimants' comments of February 25, 2015. The Claimants objected to this request on the basis that both parties had been given an equal opportunity to file comments simultaneously and had availed themselves of this opportunity.\n\n24.\n\nBy further email of February 26, 2015, the Respondent provided additional observations on the procedure to be followed.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter of March 4, 2015, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the parties that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier had considered Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation and decided not to consent to it. The Secretary's letter conveyed the following explanation from Judge Keith:\n\n*The two arbitrators, following the resignation of Professor Abi-Saab, have considered the matter of their consent to the resignation in terms of Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 8(2) of the Arbitration Rules. They have also considered the comments on that matter submitted by the Parties.*\n\n*Over a very lengthy period the two Arbitrators, particularly the President, have urged Professor Abi-Saab to complete his dissent and then, as he had himself indicated, to resign from the Tribunal so that the Respondent could appoint a replacement arbitrator. The President kept stressing the urgency of the matter and Professor Abi-Saab in mid-November, while saying that he still expected to complete the dissent by the end of that month, indicated that if he had not completed by the end of the year, he would have to resign in any event. In the course of those exchanges, the two arbitrators plainly did consent to the proposed resignation.*\n\n*The two arbitrators did not however consent to a resignation in late February when the quantum hearing was only seven weeks away and a challenge to one of the arbitrators was pending.*\n\n26.\n\nThe letter of March 4, 2015 also informed the parties that, in these circumstances, the Chairman of the Administrative Council would proceed to appoint an arbitrator to fill the vacancy caused by Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation pursuant to Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 11(2)(a). The letter also advised that the dates scheduled for the hearing on quantum had been vacated, and that once the vacancy was filled, the Proposal would be addressed by Judge Keith and the arbitrator appointed to replace Prof. Abi-Saab.\n\n27.\n\nOn March 4, 2015, the Respondent objected to the Chairman filling the vacancy on the Tribunal. Noting the reasoning in the decision, the Respondent requested copies of any documents reflecting the consent of Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier to Prof. Abi-Saab's proposed resignation. The Respondent also asked that Prof. Abi-Saab be called to provide his understanding of prior exchanges with his co-arbitrators concerning his proposed resignation. Finally, the Respondent asked Judge Keith for clarification of the decision not to consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation.\n\n28.\n\nThe parties submitted further correspondence on this matter on March 6, 7, 12, 13 and 14, 2015. The Respondent also reiterated its March 4, 2015 requests by email of March 17, 2015 addressed directly to Judge Keith, Mr. Fortier and Prof. Abi-Saab.\n\n29.\n\nOn March 23, 2015, Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier advised the parties that the correspondence requested by the Respondent could not be released as it was protected by the confidentiality of the internal deliberations of the Tribunal.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of March 25, 2015, Venezuela amended its proposal for disqualification by adding a request to disqualify both Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier on the basis of their general negative attitude toward the Respondent.\n\n31.\n\nOn March 26, 2015, the Centre set a schedule for the parties' further submissions on the Proposal.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its arguments on April 2, 2015 (\"**Respondent's Submission of April 2, 2015** \"). Venezuela also requested (a) an in-person hearing on the Proposal; and (b) a recommendation from a third party on the Proposal. The Claimants submitted a Reply on April 9, 2015 (\"**Claimants' Reply of April 9, 2015**\").\n\n33.\n\nOn April 16, 2015, Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier furnished explanations pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).\n\n34.\n\nOn April 23, 2015, both parties submitted additional comments on the Proposal.\n\n35.\n\nIn addition to the submissions filed by the parties pursuant to the schedule *,* the Respondent submitted emails concerning the Proposal on April 29, May 27 and June 1, 3, 16 and 18, 2015, and the Claimants submitted a letter on June 3, 2015. Mr. Fortier furnished additional explanations on June 1 and 18, 2015.\n\n**C. OVERVIEW**\n---------------\n\n36.\n\nVenezuela has applied to disqualify Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier on the basis of their lack of independence and impartiality, citing their negative attitude toward the Respondent, in particular in connection with the events surrounding Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation.\n\n37.\n\nVenezuela also seeks to disqualify Mr. Fortier on the basis of his lack of independence and impartiality, citing his ongoing relationship with Norton Rose. The parties' arguments are described below.\n\n**1. VENEZUELA'S ARGUMENTS CONCERNING THE ALLEGED NEGATIVE ATTITUDE OF JUDGE KEITH AND MR. FORTIER**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nVenezuela's arguments on the proposal to disqualify Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier were set forth in its submissions of March 25 and April 2 and 23, 2015.\n\n39.\n\nVenezuela claims that the events surrounding the resignation of Prof. Abi-Saab demonstrate that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier lack the requisite independence and impartiality to continue serving on this Tribunal.2\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b628.\n\n40.\n\nVenezuela claims that Prof. Abi-Saab confirmed that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier had a negative attitude toward the Respondent in his Dissenting Opinion of March 10, 2014 and in his Dissenting Opinion of February 19, 2015.3 It submits that Prof. Abi-Saab's observations are an \"undeniable indication that something was very wrong in the manner in which the Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits was reached.\"4\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b628. See also Respondent's Additional Comments of April 23, 2015 \u00b67.\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b631.\n\n41.\n\nVenezuela further alleges that this predisposition led Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier to advance the Claimants' interests throughout the proceedings, to rely almost exclusively and uncritically on the Claimants' affirmations and representations, and to systematically discredit and ignore the Respondent's evidence.5\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b630, quoting from Prof. Abi-Saab's Dissenting Opinion of March 10, 2014, \u00b6\u00b616, 22.\n\n42.\n\nVenezuela states that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier's refusal to consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation was a \"shocking decision\", lacking any \"rational explanation\" other than \"retaliation against Respondent.\"6 Venezuela further claims that \"[i]t is universally recognized that the purpose of [Article 56 of the ICSID Convention] is to prevent a party and its party-appointed arbitrator from obstructing or frustrating the proceeding by orchestrating a resignation; it is not to penalize a party be [sic] depriving it of the right to appoint a replacement arbitrator when the arbitrator it appointed resigns for serious health reasons.\"7\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b63.\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b633.\n\n43.\n\nIn Venezuela's submission, the partiality of the challenged arbitrators is demonstrated by the fact that such decision: \"(i) was taken [together with Mr. Fortier] when the entire proceeding was suspended and when Mr. Fortier could not have had any role to play since he was already challenged; (ii) was taken after Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier had 'plainly' consented to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation; and (iii) was unprecedented, given Prof. Abi-Saab's health issues, which were well known to Judge Keith, Mr. Fortier and ICSID.\"8 Venezuela also asserts that the challenged arbitrators did not address these points in their communications of March 4 and 23, 2015.9\n\nRespondent's Additional Comments of April 23, 2015 \u00b62. See also Respondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b640.\n\nRespondent's Additional Comments of April 23, 2015 \u00b64.\n\n44.\n\nVenezuela concludes that any third party would have \"justifiable doubts\" as to the impartiality of the challenged arbitrators in this case.10\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b639.\n\n**2. CLAIMANTS' REPLY**\n-----------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants' arguments on the proposal to disqualify Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier were set forth in their submissions of April 9 and 23, 2015.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the fact that a ruling is adverse to a party is not a ground for disqualification. The Claimants further contend that even if the mere issuance of an adverse decision could justify disqualification, Venezuela would have had to prove that no unbiased arbitrator could have refused to consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation. In the Claimants' view, Venezuela has not met this burden.11\n\nClaimants' Reply of April 9, 2015 \u00b6\u00b616-20.\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimants state that the relevant circumstances had changed by the time Prof. Abi-Saab resigned on February 20, 2015, and that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier had valid reasons on March 4, 2015 to refuse consent to the resignation of Prof. Abi-Saab.12\n\nClaimants' Reply of April 9, 2015 \u00b624.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants challenge Venezuela's suggestion that consent to resign can be withheld only due to collusion between the arbitrator and its appointing party. They argue that Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention is not limited to this single fact situation.13\n\nClaimants' Reply of April 9, 2015 \u00b631.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that Venezuela's complaints about procedural aspects of the replacement of Prof. Abi-Saab are wrong in law and irrelevant to the independence and impartiality of Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier. In addition, they note that Venezuela's approach creates a \"Catch-22\" situation that would place the proceeding in permanent suspension.14\n\nClaimants' Reply of April 9, 2015 \u00b646.\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimants note that even if Venezuela's position on Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention were correct, the outcome would have been the same: in either case, there would be no consent to the resignation of Prof. Abi-Saab and the Chairman would have been required to fill the vacancy on the Tribunal.15\n\nClaimants' Reply of April 9, 2015 \u00b645.\n\n51.\n\nFinally, the Claimants note that most of the facts relied upon by Venezuela in this Proposal were already addressed in the First and Second Proposals and that the First and Second Proposals were rejected.16\n\nClaimants' Reply of April 9, 2015 \u00b6\u00b647-54.\n\n**3. VENEZUELA'S ARGUMENTS CONCERNING MR. FORTIER'S ALLEGED RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTON ROSE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nVenezuela's arguments on the proposal to disqualify Mr. Fortier on the basis of his alleged ongoing relationship with Norton Rose were set forth in its submissions of February 6, 10 and 16, April 2 and 23 and June 1, 3, 16 and 18, 2015.\n\n53.\n\nAccording to Venezuela, Mr. Fortier maintained professional and emotional ties with Norton Rose after his resignation in 2011. It cites his continuing contact with Norton Rose attorneys, the fact that three Norton Rose attorneys have acted as tribunal assistants for Mr. Fortier in other cases and the proximity of Mr. Fortier's office to Norton Rose offices in Montreal.17\n\nRespondent's Submission of February 6, 2015, pages 2-4; Respondent's letter of February 10, 2015, page 2. Respondent's letter of February 16, 2015, pages 2-6; Respondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b6\u00b63, 15-22. Respondent's Submission of April 23, 2015 \u00b6\u00b69-17; Respondent's emails of June 1, 3, 16 and 18, 2015.\n\n54.\n\nVenezuela argues that Mr. Fortier's October 2011 disclosure that he might continue to work with certain attorneys already appointed as administrative assistants in ongoing arbitrations is not \"a license to maintain an ongoing, substantive professional relationship with Norton Rose senior attorneys, including in cases involving the same issues as are at issue here.\"18\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b614.\n\n55.\n\nVenezuela further states that Mr. Valasek's participation in the Yukos arbitrations \"apparently went beyond the role of an administrative secretary and was argued by Russia to be the equivalent of participation in the deliberations of the tribunal as a 'fourth arbitrator'\".19 It also claims that Mr. Valasek's role in the Yukos arbitrations \"did not fit with the description of administrative assistant\" to which Mr. Fortier had referred in his October 2011 disclosure.20 Venezuela rejects Mr. Fortier's February 13, 2015 explanations that the role of tribunal assistant was \"an obvious example\" of the roles covered by his disclosure.21\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b615.\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b618. See also Respondent's Submission of February 6, 2015, page 3.\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b618.\n\n**4. CLAIMANTS' REPLY**\n-----------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants' arguments on the proposal to disqualify Mr. Fortier on the basis of his alleged ongoing relationship with Norton Rose were set forth in their submissions of February 9, 12 and 16, April 9 and 23 and June 3, 2015.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Russia's effort to vacate the Yukos awards on the basis that Mr. Fortier's tribunal assistant exceeded the proper scope of his role is irrelevant to Mr. Fortier's independence and impartiality in this proceeding.22\n\nClaimants' Letter to the Tribunal of February 9, 2015, page 2; See also Claimants' Reply of April 9, 2015 \u00b6\u00b69-10.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Venezuela did not object to Mr. Fortier's October 2011 disclosure at the relevant time,23 and that Mr. Valasek's function in the Yukos arbitrations falls within the scope of the October 2011 disclosure.\n\nClaimants' Letter to the Tribunal of February 9, 2015, pages 3-4.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that Mr. Valasek's compensation as a tribunal assistant in the Yukos arbitrations is not evidence of any improper professional relationship between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose and that \"Venezuela has failed to explain how Mr. Valasek's service *to the tribunal* in an unrelated case could prove that Maitre Fortier lacks independence or impartiality in this case\"24 (emphasis in the original).\n\nClaimants' Letter to the Tribunal of February 12, 2015, page 2; See also Claimants' Letter to the Tribunal of February 9, 2015, page 5.\n\n**D. ARBITRATORS' EXPLANATIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1. Explanations furnished by Mr. L. Yves Fortier**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nMr. Fortier furnished explanations pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3) on February 13, 2015 (Annex A), on April 16, 2015 (Annex B), and on June 1 and 18, 2015 (Annex C).\n\n**2. Explanations furnished by Judge Kenneth Keith**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nJudge Keith furnished explanations pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3) on April 16, 2015 as follows:\n\n*In accordance with the schedule set by the ICSID Secretariat, I provide the following explanation relating to the Respondent's new proposal to disqualify Mr Fortier and myself.*\n\n*The Respondent, at the end of its Submission, concludes that I should be disqualified from continuing to act as an arbitrator in the present case because I have, together Mr Fortier, exhibited an attitude towards Respondent that in the reasonable evaluation of a third party would give rise to the appearance of a lack of the requisite impartiality (p 53).*\n\n*I have only this to say. It is over thirty years ago since I first took a judicial oath to do right to all manner of people according the laws and usages of the particular jurisdiction, without fear or favour, affection or ill will (the terms of the New Zealand oath, earlier Western Samoa, the Cook Islands and Niue and later in Fiji all to similar effect). I have made comparable oaths and solemn declarations to act impartially and conscientiously in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, arbitral tribunals and the International Court of Justice. I have always done my very best to meet those serious responsibilities. That is also true in the present case.*\n\n**E. DECISION BY THE CHAIRMAN**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. Timeliness**\n-----------------\n\n62.\n\nProposals to disqualify an arbitrator under the ICSID Convention and Rules must be submitted promptly. Arbitration Rule 9(1) reads as follows:\n\n*A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.*\n\n63.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and Rules do not specify a number of days within which a proposal for disqualification must be filed. Accordingly, the timeliness of a proposal must be determined on a case-by-case basis.25\n\nSee *F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/21), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal (June 16, 2015) \u00b640 (\"**Favianca**\").\n\n64.\n\nThe parties do not dispute the timeliness of filing the proposal to disqualify Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier based on the circumstances surrounding Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation. In any event, this aspect of the Proposal was clearly timely-filed for the purposes of ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the proposal to disqualify Mr. Fortier based on his relationship with certain members of Norton Rose acting as tribunal assistants, including Mr. Valasek, is untimely.26\n\nClaimants' Reply of April 9, 2015 \u00b652\n\n66.\n\nThe fact that certain members of Norton Rose were acting as tribunal assistant in arbitrations presided over by Mr. Fortier has been known since 2011 and was included in his disclosure of October 2011. This was raised in 2011 in the First Proposal, which proposal was rejected by Judge Keith and Prof. Abi-Saab. The Respondent has provided no new facts in this respect. Accordingly, to the extent the current Proposal is based on this assertion, it is untimely and is rejected.\n\n67.\n\nThe only new information relating to Mr Fortier's relationship with Norton Rose attorneys stems from two Global Arbitration Review articles published in January 2015. This information suggests that Mr. Valasek exceeded the proper scope of a tribunal assistant in the Yukos arbitrations, a ground advanced by Russia in the Yukos set-aside application. To the extent that this Proposal is based on this new information, it is timely-filed and is addressed in paragraphs 94 and 95 of this Decision.\n\n**2. Request for Recommendation**\n---------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nVenezuela has asked the Chairman to request a recommendation from a third party on the proposal to disqualify Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier. The bases for this request are: (a) that Mr. Fortier is currently an External Member and the Chair of the World Bank Group Sanctions Board; and (b) ICSID's involvement in some of the events giving rise to the disqualification proposal.27 The Claimants have opposed this request.28\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b66.\n\nClaimants' Reply of April 9, 2015 \u00b6\u00b655-64.\n\n69.\n\nArticle 58 of the ICSID Convention states that the decision on a proposal to disqualify the majority of arbitrators shall be taken by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.\n\n70.\n\nWhile the Chairman has discretion to request a recommendation on a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator, he has only done so on rare occasions in the past.29 In all cases, the final decision is solely that of the Chairman.30\n\nSee the cases cited by the Respondent and the Claimants in: Respondent's Submission of April 2, 2015, \u00b6 5 foonotes 6-7 and Claimants' Reply of April 9, 2015 \u00b658 footnote 55.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, *Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal (February 4, 2014) \u00b6\u00b664-66 (\"**Abaclat**\"); *Repsol, S.A. and Repsol Butano, S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/38), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal (December 13, 2013) \u00b667 (\"**Repsol**\").\n\n71.\n\nA request for a recommendation must be justified by the specific circumstances of the case at issue. As to circumstance (a) above, Mr. Fortier has never been and is not currently a staff member of the World Bank Group. As an External Member and Chair of the World Bank Group Sanctions Board, he is an independent decision-maker.\n\n72.\n\nAs to circumstance (b) above, ICSID was not involved in the events giving rise to the disqualification proposal other than to act as an impartial institution administering the case under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. The Convention and Rules do not address the situation that arose in this case where an arbitrator resigned without deciding the disqualification proposal that was pending before him.\n\n73.\n\nThe parties did not agree on the procedure to be followed and presented inconsistent solutions. The Respondent stated that \"...the reality is that we are in a situation that is unprecedented and beyond the scope of the rules.\"31 The Respondent's solution was that \"the first order of business\" was that it appoint the replacement for Prof. Abi-Saab and then the pending disqualification could be decided by Judge Keith and the Respondent's appointee.32 The Claimants proposed an incompatible course of action. They stated that \".as a first and essential step.[t]he only defensible and practical approach\"33 was to have the Chairman decide the pending challenge of Mr. Fortier and then have the Chairman appoint the replacement for Prof. Abi-Saab.34\n\nRespondent's e-mail of February 26, 2015.\n\nRespondent's letter of February 23, 2015.\n\nClaimants' letter of February 21, 2015.\n\nClaimants' letter of February 25, 2015 pp. 1-2.\n\n74.\n\nIn light of the unique situation that had arisen, and the parties' failure to agree on how to proceed, ICSID submitted the matter to the Tribunal. It was then for the Tribunal to determine whether it had authority to address the resignation, and if so, whether it would accept the resignation.\n\n75.\n\nThe circumstances raised by the Respondent do not justify a request for a third party recommendation. The Chairman therefore rejects this request.\n\n**3. Request for Oral Hearing**\n-------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent has asked the Chairman of the Administrative Council to hold an in-person hearing on the Proposal.35 The Claimants have not advanced a position in this regard.\n\nRespondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b642; Respondent's Submission of April 23, 2015 \u00b620. Respondent's emails of April 29, May 27 and June 18, 2015.\n\n77.\n\nThe parties have been given a full opportunity to argue their positions with respect to the Proposal and they have fully availed themselves of this opportunity. The parties have comprehensively briefed the Chairman on the relevant facts and law, with the Claimants submitting 11 communications and the Respondent submitting 26 communications from February 6 through June 18, 2015. In the circumstances, an oral hearing is not required to determine this proposal and the Chairman declines this request.\n\n**4. Merits**\n-------------\n\n78.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n*A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.*\n\n79.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.*\n\n80.\n\nWhile the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to \"*independent judgment*,\" and the French version to \"*toute garantie d'ind\u00e9pendance dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions*\" (guaranteed independence in exercising their functions), the Spanish version requires \"*imparcialidad de juicio*\" (impartiality of judgment). Given that all three versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both impartial and independent.36\n\nThe parties agree on this point: Respondent's Submission of April 2, 2015 \u00b62; Claimants' Reply of April 9, 2015 \u00b616. So does ICSID jurisprudence: *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Professor Francisco Orrego (December 13, 2013) \u00b665 (\"**Burlington**\"); *Abaclat supra* note 30 \u00b674; Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v.

Independence is characterized by the absence of external control. Independence and impartiality both \"protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case.\"37\n\n*Burlington supra* note 36 \u00b666; *Abaclat supra* note 30 \u00b675; *Blue Bank supra* note 36 \u00b659; *Repsol supra* note 30 \u00b671.\n\n82.\n\nA number of decisions have concluded that the word \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the Convention means \"evident\" or \"obvious,\"38 and that it relates to the ease with which the alleged lack of the required qualities can be perceived.39\n\n*Burlington supra* note 36 \u00b668, footnote 83; *Abaclat* supra note 30 \u00b671, footnote 25; *Blue Bank supra* note 36 \u00b661, footnote 43; *Repsol supra* note 30 \u00b673, footnote 58.\n\nC. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention, Second Edition (2009), page 1202 \u00b6\u00b6134-154.\n\n83.\n\nArticles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather, it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.40\n\n*Burlington supra* note 36 \u00b666; *Abaclat supra* note 30 \u00b676; *Blue Bank supra* note 36 \u00b659; *Repsol supra* note 30 \u00b671.\n\n84.\n\nThe legal standard applied to a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator is an \"objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.\" As a consequence, the subjective belief of the party proposing the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.41\n\n*Burlington supra* note 36 \u00b667, *Abaclat supra* note 30 \u00b677; *Blue Bank supra* note 36 \u00b660, *Repsol supra* note 30 \u00b672.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent claims that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier lack the independence and impartiality required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. It states that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier harbor a general negative attitude toward the Respondent.\n\n86.\n\nVenezuela's position is that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier did not have authority to discharge their functions under Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2) because of the Respondent's then pending proposal to disqualify Mr. Fortier. For Venezuela, the fact that they discharged their functions under these provisions could only be explained by concluding they were biased.\n\n87.\n\nThis conclusion of bias ignores the record in this case. Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier sought comments from the parties on the resignation and received conflicting views on the correct procedure and the correct outcome. Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier considered these views when rendering their March 4, 2015 decision and reached an informed decision that they could discharge their function under the Convention and Rules.\n\n88.\n\nSimilarly, Venezuela argues that the decision to refuse consent to the resignation could only have been motivated by the desire to retaliate against the Respondent and its nominee. It states that the sole legal basis to refuse such consent is the existence of collusion between the resigning arbitrator and its appointing party. Since Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier did not find collusion between the Respondent and Prof. Abi-Saab, Venezuela asserts that their refusal could only be explained by concluding they were biased.\n\n89.\n\nAgain, this conclusion of bias ignores the reasons of Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier in the March 4, 2015 letter which expressly cite the changed circumstances prevailing by March 2015. In their reasons Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier noted that Prof Abi-Saab had indicated he would complete his dissent by the end of November and that he would resign by the end of 2014 in any event. However, the dissent was not issued until February 19, 2015 and the resignation was not tendered until February 20, 2015. Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier also noted that by February 20, 2015 the quantum hearing was only seven weeks away and the challenge to Mr. Fortier was still pending decision by Judge Keith and Prof. Abi-Saab.\n\n90.\n\nIt is evident that the Respondent and the challenged arbitrators differ on the appropriate procedure and the circumstances that would warrant a refusal to consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation under Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2). However, this difference of views does not demonstrate apparent or actual bias on the part of Judge Keith or Mr. Fortier.\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on statements in Prof. Abi Saab's two Dissenting Opinions. Prof. Abi Saab's Dissenting Opinions reveal profound disagreement among the Tribunal on points of law and assessment of evidence. Such disagreement is not proof that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier harbored a general negative attitude toward Venezuela. At most, it reflects strongly held differences of opinion among highly experienced arbitrators.\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent claims that Mr. Fortier should be disqualified on the additional basis of his alleged ongoing relationship with Norton Rose. It bases this allegation in particular on three facts: (a) that certain members of Norton Rose (including Mr. Valasek) acted as tribunal assistants for Mr. Fortier in other arbitrations; (b) that Mr. Valasek exceeded his proper role when he acted as assistant to the tribunal in the Yukos arbitrations presided over by Mr. Fortier; and (c) the physical proximity of Mr. Fortier's office with Norton Rose offices in Montreal.\n\n93.\n\nThe arguments with respect to (a) above have already been rejected as they were not filed promptly (see *supra* \u00b6 66).\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent's argument with respect to (b) above is unsubstantiated. There is no evidence that Mr. Valasek acted beyond his stated role. All that currently exists is an allegation by Russia in the Yukos set-aside proceedings to the effect that Mr. Valasek acted as a \"fourth arbitrator\". These allegations are insufficient to demonstrate the extent of Mr. Valasek's involvement in the Yukos arbitrations.\n\n95.\n\nEven if proved, Mr. Valasek's involvement in the Yukos arbitrations is irrelevant to a determination of Mr. Fortier's independence or impartiality in this case. The Yukos arbitrations involved different parties, different facts, and different treaties than the present case. Accordingly, the facts concerning Mr. Valasek's involvement in the Yukos arbitrations are irrelevant to Mr. Fortier's independence and impartiality in this case.\n\n96.\n\nFinally, with respect to (c) above, the proximity of office space is irrelevant to determining Mr. Fortier's independence and impartiality.\n\n97.\n\nA third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the facts in this case would not conclude that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier lack the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, the Proposal is rejected.\n\n**F. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n98.\n\nHaving considered all of the facts alleged and the arguments submitted by the parties, and\n\nfor the reasons stated above, the Chairman:\n\n(a) rejects the request for a recommendation on the Proposal from a third party;\n\n(b) rejects the request for an oral hearing on the Proposal; and\n\n(c) rejects the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela's Proposal to Disqualify Judge Kenneth Keith and Mr. L.

On December 13, 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on July 23, 2008. Its members were Judge Kenneth Keith, appointed as President pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention; Mr. L. Yves Fortier, appointed by the Claimants; and Sir Ian Brownlie, appointed by the Respondent. The Tribunal was reconstituted on February 1, 2010, with Prof. Georges Abi-Saab, appointed by the Respondent following Sir Ian Brownlie\u2019s death.\n\n4.\n\nOn October 5, 2011, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier after he disclosed that Norton Rose OR LLP (\"**Norton Rose**\"), the law firm in which he was then a partner, proposed to merge with Macleod Dixon LLP, effective January 1, 2012 (\"**First Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n5.\n\nOn February 27, 2012 Judge Keith and Prof. Abi-Saab rejected the First Proposal for Disqualification (\"**Decision on the First Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n6.\n\nOn September 3, 2013, the Tribunal issued a majority **Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits**. The Majority found the Respondent in breach of its international obligation to negotiate compensation in good faith for its taking of the Claimants\u2019 assets in three oil projects in Venezuela. Prof. Abi-Saab dissented from this Decision and provided his **opinion** on February 19, 2015.\n\n7.\n\nOn September 8, 2013, the Respondent requested a clarification and further explanations from the Tribunal regarding certain findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits. On March 10, 2014, the Tribunal issued a majority decision rejecting the Respondent\u2019s request (the \"**Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration**\"). Prof. Abi-Saab appended a **dissenting opinion** to the Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration.\n\n8.\n\nOn March 11, 2014, Respondent proposed the disqualification of Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier based on their alleged general attitude toward the Respondent (\"**Second Proposal for Disqualification**\").

RESPONDENT'S FOURTH PROPOSAL TO DISQUALIFY L. YVES FORTIER**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of October 26, 2015, Respondent brought to the attention of the Tribunal a report of a linguistics expert filed by the Russian Federation in the set-aside proceedings of the *Yukos* awards pending before the District Court of The Hague and in the enforcement proceeding before the U.S. District Court, Washington, D.C. According to the report, it was \"[e]xtremely likely that Mr. Valasek wrote significant portions\" of the substantive sections of the *Yukos* decisions.1 If that report is correct, Mr. Valasek\u2019s role in the *Yukos* arbitrations would not comport with the description of that role provided earlier by Mr. Fortier. The Respondent called on Mr. Fortier to clarify that point.\n\nSee Annex 2 of Respondent\u2019s Letter of October 26, 2015, entitled \"Expert Report Regarding Authorship of the Final Awards prepared by Carole E. Chaski, Ph.D., dated September 11, 2015, *Hulley Enterprises Ltd. et al. v. Russian Federation*, Case No. 1:14-cv-01996-ABJ, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Excerpt)\".\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants replied to this letter on October 28, 2015, arguing that Respondent\u2019s allegations were irrelevant and merely dilatory. Respondent answered that same day, rejecting Claimants\u2019 statements and reiterating its request.\n\n17.\n\nOn October 30, 2015, Mr. Fortier replied to Respondent\u2019s letters, as follows:\n\nMesdames, Gentlemen,\n\nI have seen the Respondent\u2019s letters of 26 and 28 October to the Tribunal and attachments. I have also seen the Claimants\u2019 letter of 28 October.\n\nAs you know, the *Yukos* tribunals are *functus officio* and not parties to the set aside proceeding in the *Yukos* cases presently pending in the District Court of The Hague or the proceeding relating to the *Yukos* awards in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Therefore, I cannot comment on any evidence which may have been submitted to these two courts.\n\nAs for the \"clarification\" which the Respondent seeks, I reiterate what I wrote in paragraph 6 of my Explanations of 16 April 2015:\n\n\"[...] Mr. Valasek undertook numerous tasks assigned to him by the Tribunals, including summarizing evidence, researching specific issues of law and organizing the massive case file. Notwithstanding any press reports to the contrary and the speculation of the Respondent, Mr. Valasek was not involved and did not play any role in the Tribunal\u2019s decision-making process.\" This is a true and correct description of Mr. Valasek\u2019s role in the *Yukos* cases.\n\nI note that, in its letter of 28 October 2015, the Respondent refers again to \"[my] ongoing relationship with Norton Rose.\" In this connection, I reiterate again what I wrote in paragraph 2 of my Explanations of 16 April 2015:\n\n\"I affirm on my conscience and honour that I severed all of my professional links with Norton Rose as of 31 December 2011.\"\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of October 30, 2015, Respondent rejected Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations and requested Mr. Fortier to provide a clear answer to the question whether Mr. Valasek did in fact write the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning and conclusions of the *Yukos* awards.\n\n19.\n\nOn November 6, 2015, Mr. Fortier replied to Respondent as follows:\n\nMesdames, Gentlemen,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of the Respondent\u2019s letter of 30 October 2015.\n\nI have answered the Respondent\u2019s question in my letter of 30 October. Mr. Vala-sek\u2019s role in the *Yukos* cases was as I described it in my previous explanations of 16 April 2015 and 30 October 2015.\n\nThe Respondent says it is irrelevant that the *functus officio Yukos* tribunals are not parties to the *Yukos* court proceedings. I beg to differ. If I were to assert that \"the expert report regarding the authorship of the *Yukos* decision\" was incorrect, I would be commenting on evidence which has been submitted to these two courts and I would be breaching the confidentiality of the tribunal\u2019s deliberations. This, I cannot do.\n\nWith the greatest of respect for Respondent\u2019s Counsel, I will now put an end to our correspondence.\n\n20.\n\nOn November 9, 2015, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier (the \"**Proposal**\" or \"**Respondent\u2019s Submission of November 9, 2015**\").\n\n21.\n\nOn November 10, 2015, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken with respect to the Proposal.\n\n22.\n\nOn the same date, the President of the Tribunal, having consulted with Professor Bucher, set a timetable for the parties\u2019 submissions and for Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants filed a submission on November 12, 2015 (\"**Claimants\u2019 Reply Submission of November 12, 2015**\") and Mr. Fortier furnished his explanations on November 20, 2015 (\"**Mr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of November 20, 2015**\").\n\n24.\n\nOn November 27, 2015, both parties submitted additional observations on the Proposal (\"**Respondent\u2019s Additional Observations**\" and \"**Claimants\u2019 Additional Comments**\", respectively).\n\n**B. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS AND MR. FORTIER'S EXPLANATIONS**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. RESPONDENT'S PROPOSAL OF NOVEMBER 9, 2015**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent makes its Proposal in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. It recalls at the outset its concern, expressed to the Tribunal since 2011, about Mr. Fortier\u2019s relationship with Norton Rose which, through its merger with McLeod Dixon in 2011, became the firm more adverse to Venezuela and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (\"**PDVSA**\") than any other in the world. That concern included the materiality of the connections between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose attorneys, including Mr. Martin Valasek, given that (i) Norton Rose represented ConocoPhillips companies in cases against PDVSA arising out of the same association agreements that are involved in this case and (ii) Mr. Fortier\u2019s ongoing relationship with Mr. Valasek was in connection with cases that involved some of the same critical issues that are involved in this case, such as the proper valuation date in the case of expropriation, at the same time as those issues were being litigated here.\n\n26.\n\nAfter referring to a statement made by Mr. Fortier in 2011 about severing his ties with Norton Rose by the end of 2011 in which he said that he \"may\" continue to call upon members of Norton Rose for assistance after January 2012 and a related statement made by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in his decision of July 1, 2015,2 the Respondent turns to the proceedings in The Hague and Washington D.C. relating to the *Yukos* awards and the exchanges involving Mr. Fortier in respect of those proceedings.3 It understands the sentence at the end of Mr. Fortier\u2019s message of November 6, 2015, as meaning that he will not be answering Respondent\u2019s direct question or providing any further clarification. It continues:\n\nUnder the circumstances, Respondent is constrained to propose the disqualification of Mr. Fortier on the ground that he has made incomplete, inaccurate and/or misleading statements concerning his ongoing relationship with Norton Rose attorneys. As pointed out in our letter of October 30, 2015, there is an obvious and material distinction between: (i) everything Mr. Fortier has disclosed about the role of Norton Rose attorneys in his cases (including both the role he described in his original disclosure in October of 2011, when he stated that he may \"continue to call upon\" Norton Rose attorneys who had assisted him with certain files \"e.g. by acting as Administrative Secretary to the Tribunal\" and the tasks of Mr. Valasek that Mr. Fortier described in his explanations submitted on April 16, 2015, and reiterated on October 20, 2015); and (ii) writing the reasoning and conclusions of the awards in the *Yukos* cases.4\n\nSee \u00b613 above.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 15-19 above.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission of November 9, 2015, \u00b610.\n\n27.\n\nThe Proposal addresses, by reference to commentaries, the distinction between the tasks of an administrative secretary or assistant and writing the substantive portions of an award. It then states that the \"only remaining question... is whether as a matter of fact Mr. Valasek\u2019s activity in the *Yukos* cases did indeed include writing the reasoning and conclusions of the *Yukos* awards. That is the question we have posed to Mr. Fortier. The answer is obviously within his personal knowledge and it does not take long to say either 'yes\u2019 or 'no'. Since he has refused to answer, we assume, and we believe a reasonable third party would assume, that the answer is 'yes\u2019 which means that the description provided by Mr. Fortier on April 16, 2015, and reiterated on October 30, 2015, did not fulfil his duty to provide full and accurate disclosure in this case\".\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent continues by saying that the foregoing should be viewed against the background of incomplete, inaccurate and misleading disclosures made by Mr. Fortier from the beginning concerning his relationship with Norton Rose. It gives seven examples from October 18, 2011, to June 18, 2015.\n\n29.\n\n\"In sum\", the Proposal says:\n\n[G]iven Mr. Fortier\u2019s refusal to answer the direct question regarding the authorship of the substantive portions of the *Yukos* awards, his disclosures in this case have been incomplete, inaccurate and/or misleading, which constitutes a clear ground for his disqualification to serve as arbitrator in this case. A reasonable third party observer would simply not equate the tasks described in any of Mr. Fortier\u2019s disclosures with the writing of a tribunal\u2019s reasoning and conclusions. Moreover, even if Mr. Valasek did not write the *Yukos* tribunal\u2019s reasoning and conclusions, Mr. Fortier\u2019s failure to answer the direct question posed would itself constitute grounds for disqualification inasmuch as none of his reasons for not answering the question is tenable. In particular: (i) the fact that the *Yukos* tribunals are *functus officio* and are not parties to the *Yukos* court proceedings is irrelevant; (ii) there is no bar to Mr. Fortier\u2019s commenting on the expert report submitted in the *Yukos* court proceedings; (iii) Respondent\u2019s straightforward question can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" without referring to the expert report in the *Yukos* court proceedings; and (iv) the confidentiality of tribunal deliberations relates to the exchange of views among the arbitrators, not to information unrelated to the deliberations.5\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission of November 9, 2015, \u00b616.\n\n**2. CLAIMANTS' REPLY SUBMISSION OF NOVEMBER 12, 2015**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants in their reply contend that the new challenge is frivolous and brought in bad faith. They request that the unchallenged members (a) promptly reject the proposal, (b) order the Respondent to bear the Claimants\u2019 costs in addressing this proposal, to be paid immediately, and (c) dismiss any further proposals to disqualify Mr. Fortier based upon events on the unrelated *Yukos* proceedings.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Proposal rests on a regurgitation of arguments already rejected in earlier challenges to Mr. Fortier. The Claimants also reject the Respondent\u2019s contention that arbitrators answer every query a party chooses to put to them, however irrelevant, on pain of disqualification.\n\n**3. L. YVES FORTIER'S EXPLANATIONS OF NOVEMBER 20, 2015**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nMr. Fortier provided his explanation on November 20, 2015 (Annex A).\n\n**4. RESPONDENT'S ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS OF NOVEMBER 27, 2015**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent, in its additional observations, concluded by agreeing with Mr. Fortier that there are two bases for its Proposal:\n\n(i) that he failed to answer the question posed to him by Respondent as to the authorship of the *Yukos* awards; and (ii) that his disclosures in this case have been incomplete, inaccurate and/or misleading. On the first ground, after stating categorically that he would not and could not answer the question referred to in (i) above and advising that he was bringing the correspondence to a close, he did provide an answer, but one that only gives rise to additional questions, such as whether Mr. Valasek wrote any substantive part of the *Yukos* awards or only prepared drafts, as opposed to the final awards themselves. On the second ground, Respondent submits that a reasonable third party would conclude that Mr. Fortier\u2019s disclosures regarding his relationships with Norton Rose and its attorneys, which he has dribbled out begrudgingly only after repeated requests by Respondent, do not meet the standard of \"complete and accurate\" disclosure set forth in Mr. Fortier\u2019s own explanations. Even the answer belatedly provided to the question regarding authorship of the *Yukos* awards has to be weighed against the findings of the forensic linguistic expert that \"it is extremely likely that Mr. Valasek wrote the majority\" of the sections of the awards on preliminary objections, liability and quantum, and viewed against the background of Mr. Fortier\u2019s other disclosures reviewed above. Respondent therefore again urges Mr. Fortier to reconsider his decision not to resign, but if he does not, Respondent respectfully submits that the \"accumulation of circumstances\" requires his disqualification and requests that you so decide.6\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Observations of November 27, 2015, p. 11.\n\n**5. CLAIMANTS' ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OF NOVEMBER 27, 2015**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants, in their additional comments, \"in light of Mr. Fortier\u2019s response\", seek the immediate relief set out in their submissions.7\n\nSee \u00b630 above.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent makes its Proposal for disqualification in terms of Article 57 of the ICSID Convention (which refers back to Article 14) and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. They provide as the ground for disqualification a manifest lack of the qualities required on appointment. That quality which is relevant here is that the arbitrator may be relied upon to exercise \"independent judgment\". The Spanish version of Article 14 requires \"imparcialidad de juicio\" (impartiality of judgment) and the French \"toute garantie d\u2019ind\u00e9-pendance dans leurs fonctions\" (guaranteed independence in the exercise of their functions). Given that all language versions of the Convention are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be impartial and independent. In relation to disqualification, the judgment whether the arbitrator is manifestly lacking in the ability to act independently and impartially is to be made objectively, as if by a reasonable third person.\n\n36.\n\nAlthough the Respondent in the first sentence of its Proposal of November 9, 2015, bases its Proposal on Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Two Members note that the Respondent does not ever set out the standard those provisions state nor does it directly address it, either in general terms or by reference to the particular facts to which it refers. In its additional observations it does refer to a failure to disclose facts that \"in the eyes of the parties\" might create doubts as to the arbitrator\u2019s impartiality or independence. The reference is to the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration adopted in October 2014. The Respondent reads this guideline in this subjective way: it is for the Respondent to determine what it might in good faith consider relevant for disclosure and, once it had, it was incumbent upon Mr. Fortier to make complete and accurate disclosure.8\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Additional Observations of November 27, 2015, pp 6-8, para (i); Respondent\u2019s Submission of November 9, 2015, p.5 n.12, also refers to the Explanation to the relevant Guideline.\n\n37.\n\nThe Two Members consider in turn the two grounds for disqualification identified by the Respondent and Mr. Fortier, beginning with the allegation about his disclosures -that they have been incomplete, inaccurate and/or misleading. The allegations relating to Mr. Valasek\u2019s role in the *Yukos* cases are considered later. As just noted, the Respondent gives some emphasis to the 2014 IBA Guidelines.9 More relevant in this context is the continuing obligation of arbitrators in ICSID cases under Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules promptly to notify the Secretary-General of the Centre of (a) any relationships with the parties or (b) any other circumstances that may cause the arbitrator\u2019s reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party that arises during the proceedings. No specific breach of that obligation to inform the Secretary-General is alleged. All the facts relating to this ground as presented in seven groups set out in the Proposal occurred from October 18, 2011, to June 18, 2015.10 All of that material and related comments and submissions by the parties were before the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council when, in his decision of July 1, 2015, he rejected the Proposal of the Respondent to disqualify a majority of the Tribunal. In the light of that decision, a challenge based on the same facts cannot be presented again, either individually or cumulatively. The Two Members also recall the requirement in Arbitration Rule 9(1) that proposals for disqualification be filed promptly. This has been done in the past but cannot be complied with again now in relation to the same facts. This ground for disqualification accordingly fails.\n\nWhile Respondent is correct in noting that General Standard 3(a) refers to \"the eyes of the parties\", it is not clearly stated that the IBA Guidelines are promoting a subjective test, which may be based on the views of one party only. The standard refers to facts or circumstances that may \"give rise to doubts as to the arbitrator\u2019s impartiality or independence\", and General Standard 2(b) further states that the test for disqualification is \"an objective one\".\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Submission of November 9, 2015, \u00b615.\n\n38.\n\nThat is to say, the Two Members cannot accept that they can be seized with a \"cumulative record\" of this and all prior proposals for Mr. Fortier\u2019s disqualification, as claimed by the Respondent in its additional observations, submitting that these prior proposals are incorporated into the present Proposal.11 The Two Members are seized only with the Proposal made on November 9, 2015. The Proposal does not allege new facts requiring them to reconsider the facts alleged in relation to prior requests for disqualification.\n\n*Id*, \u00b61.\n\n39.\n\nThe Two Members now consider the other ground invoked by the Respondent for the disqualification of Mr. Fortier - that he failed to answer the question posed to him by the Respondent as to the authorship of the *Yukos* awards. In the opinion of the Two Members, Mr. Fortier has in fact fully answered that question. In his explanations,12 he first recalls what he said in his April 16, 2015, explanations; \"Mr. Valasek was not involved in and did not play any role in the [ *Yukos* ] tribunal\u2019s decision-making process\". Second, he says, \"my answer to the Respondent\u2019s question is NO. Mr. Valasek did not write the tribunal\u2019s reasoning and conclusions of the *Yukos* awards\". The Two Members understand that, in this statement, Mr. Fortier fully answers the Respondent\u2019s question to him about the authorship of the *Yukos* tribunal\u2019s reasoning and conclusions of the awards. They note that the Respondent did not comment on the part of the explanation in which Mr. Fortier said \"my answer to the Respondent\u2019s question [seeking a simple 'Yes\u2019 or 'No'] is NO\".\n\nSee \u00b632 above and Annex A.\n\n40.\n\nThe Two Members also note that the Respondent\u2019s submission on this matter depends on an assumption which, as it acknowledges, is yet to be established. The assumption is based on the expert advice so far presented by one side (and only some portion of which is before the Two Members). That is not a basis on which the Two Members can depend, particularly in the face of the statement clearly made by Mr. Fortier. The allegation, assuming it can be established, must be capable of being related to the present case - that is, that the particular collaboration with Mr. Valasek gives rise to a manifest lack of independence and impartiality in this case. The Two Members conclude that the challenge under this heading also fails. The Respondent has not established that Mr. Fortier manifestly lacks the ability to act independently and impartially in the current arbitration.\n\n**D. COSTS**\n------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Two Members see no reason to depart from the standard practice of determining costs issues at the end of the proceeding.\n\n**E. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n42.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Two Members:\n\n(1) decide to dismiss the Proposal made by the Respondent to disqualify Mr. Yves Fortier as Arbitrator, and\n\n(2) decide to defer the application made by the Claimants for an order for costs to a later stage in the proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2016-02-09T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Andreas Bucher", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2016-02-09T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Andreas Bucher\n------------------------------------\n\n*I. Introduction*\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nMy welcome as a member of the Tribunal freshly reconstituted on August 10, 2015 was marked by the filing, the very same day, of Respondent\u2019s Application for Reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Respondent\u2019s [first] Request for Reconsideration of March 10, 2014 (the \"Majority Reconsideration Decision\"). This Second Application caused Claimants to respond in their letter of August 12, 2015, followed by comments contained in Respondent\u2019s letter of the same day, which was addressed in turn by Claimants\u2019 response by letter of August 13, 2015, again answered by Respondent through its email of August 14, 2015. It is common knowledge that Respondent\u2019s initial and renewed requests relate to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits dated September 3, 2013 (the \"Majority Merits Decision\"). My learned Colleagues on the Tribunal\u2019s bench have decided to maintain their initial position taken in the \"Majority Reconsideration Decision\", well aware (in light of my notes submitted on August 18 and September 9, 2015) that it will again remain a majority ruling, associated to a new dissent as stated below, which adds support to Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion of March 10, 2014. The refined thoughts contained in a recent article1, on which the Parties have filed comments on January 22, 2016, did not have the effect of changing my Colleagues\u2019 categorical position, resulting in the Majority\u2019s Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of 10 March 2014, dated February 9, 2016 (the \"Second Majority Reconsideration Decision\", or the \"Renewed Version\").\n\nCharles N. Brower/Paula F. Henin, Res judicata, *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, *in* Building International Investment Law, The First 50 Years of ICSID, ed. by Meg Kinnear *et al,,*  Alphen aan den Rijn 2016, p. 55-69.\n\n*II. Scope of Opinion*\n----------------------\n\n2.\n\nAs I understand from the Respondent\u2019s Application for Reconsideration dated August 10, 2015, the Tribunal is seized, and has been seized through the earlier Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration of September 8, 2013 with a factual pattern that allegedly points to \"certain obvious factual, legal and logical errors\" in the Majority Merits Decision of September 3, 2013, \"the correction of any one of which would require a change in the majority\u2019s conclusion on the issue of good faith negotiation\" (Respondent\u2019s Application, page 2).\n\n3.\n\nWhen it was seized with the matter in September 2013, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that \"it does not have the power to reconsider the Decision of 3 September 2013\" The conclusion thus reached in the Majority Reconsideration Decision means that the Tribunal did not enter into any examination of the relief Respondent was seeking through its September 8, 2013 Request.\n\n4.\n\nI understand that Respondent\u2019s objective expressed in its August 10 Application is limited to request the Tribunal to accept that its Decision of March 10, 2014 may be revisited. The Tribunal is only asked to declare being capable of revisiting the Majority Merits Decision of September 3, 2013 on the basis of Respondent\u2019s allegations contained in its two requests for reconsideration, these allegations being subject of further development once a ruling is made that such proceeding is opened.\n\n5.\n\nWhen considering the here relevant part of the Majority Merits Decision of September 3, 2013 that the Majority places beyond its power of judgment any further, I would suggest to examine the matter from two different perspectives: (1) the content and effects of the decision (III, paras. 6-22) and (2) its purported binding effect (IV-VII, paras. 24-80).\n\n*III. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nIt is worth recalling the precise terms of the *dispositif* of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits:\n\n\"404. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. It does not have jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Investment Law and accordingly the claims by ConocoPhillips Company are dismissed; and\n\nb. It has jurisdiction under Article 9 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty over:\n\ni. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV, ConocoPhilips Hamaca BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of (1) the increase in the income tax rate which came into effect on 1 January 2007 and (2) the expropriation or migration; and\n\nii. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of the increase in the extraction tax in effect from 24 May 2006.\n\nc. All claims based on a breach of Article 3 of the BIT are rejected.\n\nd. The Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT.\n\ne. The date of valuation of the ConocoPhillips assets is the date of the Award.\n\nf. All other claims based on a breach of Article 6(c) of the BIT are rejected.\n\ng. All other questions, including those concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the parties\u2019 determination are reserved for future determination.\"\n\n7.\n\nUnder letter b), the decision is grounding its jurisdiction on claims made by Claimants on the basis of the BIT only.\n\n8.\n\nFor present purposes, the claims related to increases in taxes as referred to under letter a (i) and (ii) are not to be considered, as they are unrelated to Article 6 of the BIT and particularly to Article 6(c). The claim to be looked at is what the Tribunal identified as the \"claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV, ConocoPhillips Hamaca BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of [(1)... and] (2) the expropriation or migration\".\n\n9.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request for relief raised in this latter respect reads, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n\"(a) DECLARE that Venezuela has breached:\n\n(i) Article 11 of the Foreign Investment Law and Article 6 of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating and/or taking measures equivalent to expropriation with respect to ConocoPhillips\u2019 investments in Venezuela;\n\n[...]\n\n(b) ORDER Venezuela to pay damages to ConocoPhillips for its breaches of the Foreign Investment Law and the Treaty in an amount to be determined at a later stage in these proceedings, including by payment of compound interest at such a rate and for such period as the Tribunal considers just and appropriate;\n\n(c) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate;\n\n[...]\"\n\n10.\n\nIn light of these references, Claimants\u2019 claims that are to be retained for present purposes are the claim for a declaration on a breach of Article 6 of the BIT in matters of expropriation and migration, followed by a claim to pay damages for Respondent\u2019s violation of the Treaty, *i.e.* Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the Merits has affirmed Respondent\u2019s breach of its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation based on the market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT. It can be easily verified that no such claim was contained in Claimants\u2019 Request for Relief. It is my understanding that no such claim has ever been made by Claimants elsewhere in the course of this proceeding.2\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the Merits states in paragraph 335 (including footnote 355) that Claimants contend in paragraph 19 of their Memorial on the Merits of September 15, 2008 that the takings were unlawful \"for one or more of the reasons indicated in questions (2)-(4) in paragraph 334 above\", thus including a claim based on Respondent\u2019s failure to negotiate in good faith. Nothing is correct in this statement. At the referenced paragraph, Claimants state that Venezuela must exercise the prerogative to nationalize in accordance with national and international law, and that this includes the duty to provide for compensation. None of the reasons outlined by the Tribunal\u2019s Decision in paragraph 334 can be found there.\n\n12.\n\nSuch claim is not contained either in the relief requesting the Tribunal to \"Award such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate\". In any event, even if this would be the case, such relief is not included in the claims over which the Tribunal asserted its jurisdiction.\n\n13.\n\nIt may also be noted that in its Procedural Order No. 3 of June 12, 2010, the Tribunal did not consider the matter relevant for being dealt with as an issue to be added to the \"claims\" not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. This addition was made in paragraph 334 of the Decision at the Tribunal\u2019s own initiative, and it was identified as nothing more than one of \"four issues\" to be dealt with as part of \"several issues\" arising out of Article 6 of the BIT. Such \"issue\" did not represent or reflect a dispute dividing the Parties and calling for a legal determination.\n\n14.\n\nIf these observations are taken as the basis for the analysis of the conclusion under letter d) of the **dispositif** it appears that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction and no mission to make any such ruling. Indeed, the Tribunal\u2019s **dispositif** on the scope of its jurisdiction is based directly, in relevant part, on the claims raised by the three ConcocoPhillips Parties in respect of \"expropriation or migration\". A decision in respect of Respondent\u2019s purported obligation to negotiate in good faith has not been included in the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and has therefore been rendered *ultra vires.* If the topic is shifted from its jurisdictional character to the merits, the Tribunal acted *ultra petita* given the fact that none of the Parties asked the Tribunal to render such a decision. If this latter fact would be taken for what it means, it would appear that any discussion about *res judicata -* as argued by Claimants and acknowledged in the Majority Reconsideration Decision - is devoid of any substance because there was no *res judicatum* anyhow, the Tribunal having affirmed a decision on a question that it was not asked to rule upon.\n\n15.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 briefs on *quantum* were designed to draw the consequences in respect of damages based on the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits. The Tribunal, when ordering the Parties to submit such briefs in its Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration of March 10, 2014, did not determine or qualify the violation of the legal obligation in relation to which the damages are to be quantified. There can hardly be an assessment of damages without reference to the underlying liability and the causal link required between both of them.\n\n16.\n\nGiven the fact that the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits identifies only one breach of a nature to allow consequential damage requests, the *quantum* to be determined must relate to the violation of an obligation to negotiate in good faith. This would mean as a matter of principle that the assessment of damages must have as its goal to wipe out the economic consequences of the breach of such an obligation.\n\n17.\n\nThis is not, however, what the Parties understand and take as the very basis of their statements on *quantum'.*\n\n18.\n\nClaimant\u2019s position is as follows:\n\n\"In its September 2013 Decision, the Tribunal\u2019s ultimate and unassailable conclusion was that Venezuela acted unlawfully in expropriating the three Projects. That breach of international law requires Venezuela to make full reparation to the Claimants for the investment taken, which is the matter now before the Tribunal.\"3\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on Quantum of 19 May 2014, para. 8. Similar statements are contained in Claimants\u2019 Reply on Quantum of 13 October 2014, paras. 2, 16, 87. Accordingly, Claimants\u2019 Experts Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller state in their Report dated May 19, 2014 as follows: \"Our calculation of damages is based on the fair market value that the Claimants would have derived from the Projects but for their unlawful expropriation.\"\n\n19.\n\nWhen reading Respondent\u2019s explanations, it is easy to understand that it is opposing Claimants\u2019 presentation. It joins however Claimants\u2019 view in as much as it understands that the Tribunal\u2019s Majority Decision contains a \"finding of unlawful nationalization\"4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Quantum of 18 August 2014, paras. 8 (page 6), 36.\n\n20.\n\nWhen the view is, as it should be, that the assessment of damages must be connected to the breach as it was identified in the **dispositif** of the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits (letter d), these both positions are not correct. On the other hand, however, they are perfectly correct when the liability to be considered is based on Article 6 of the BIT as this had been claimed by Claimants.5 However, this is precisely the breach of the BIT that is not affirmed in the **dispositif** of the Decision.6 The Majority of the Tribunal decided to proceed (exclusively) with the examination of damages without ruling about the underlying liability.7\n\nClaimants also submit that international law requires the Respondent to restore the Claimants \"to the position they would have enjoyed but for the confiscation\": Claimants\u2019 Reply on Quantum of 13 October 2014, Title II/A before para. 16. The situation in which Claimants should be restored is that just before the taking and not that when the breach of the obligation to negotiate in good faith occurred.\n\nThis has been stated already by Professor Abi-Saab in his Dissenting Opinion on Jurisdiction and the Merits of February 19, 2015, paras. 264-267. \"We thus have a Decision the main finding of which - that of the illegality of the expropriation - cannot be found anywhere in its text.\" (para. 264)\n\nIn its Note attached to the Renewed Version, the Majority provides an unsollicitated interpretation of letter d of para. 404 of the **dispositif** of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, concluding that this provision was \"precisely\" stating that \"Venezuela has breached Article 6 of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating\" Claimants\u2019 investments in Venezuela. However, letter d of the **dispositif** addresses exclusively Respondent\u2019s breach of its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation, which the Decision identified as being \u00ab commonly accepted \u00bb, omitting to refer to any grounding in Article 6 of the BIT (para. 362, quoted in the Note). This obligation was not - and could not be - based on Article 6(c). This provision was referred to merely as providing the standard on which good faith negotiations had to be based (see paras. 334(4), 404(d)). In Claimants\u2019 briefs on the Merits, the assertions on the unlawfulness of the expropriation have been heavily supplied by the absence of any reasonable compensation on Respondent\u2019s part, however without relying on a violation of an obligation to negotiate in good faith (cf. Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits of September 15, 2008, paras. 297-320; Claimants\u2019 Reply on the Merits of November 2, 2009, paras. 375-391, 415-427, 432-437). Therefore, Claimants\u2019 claim for a declaration that Venezuela had breached Article 6 has not been based on such violation.\n\n21.\n\nThe interim assessment is therefore that the issue relating to the nature and legality of the disputed nationalization has not yet been ruled upon. In this respect, the ruling made under letter d) of the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits has no impact. Indeed, no \"obligation to negotiate in good faith\" is contained in Article 6 of the BIT or more particularly in its letter c) and the Tribunal does not mention any. This letter states that \"the measures are taken against just compensation\" that shall represent the market value. The requirement for compensation is one of three conditions to be complied with in order to authorize a Contracting Party to take any measure to expropriate or nationalize, as stated in the introductory part of Article 6. Therefore, the third condition stated in letter c) has as its objective to permit expropriation or nationalization if the two other conditions under letters a) and b) are met. This means that the \"just compensation\" is one of the conditions for avoiding a breach under Article 6 of the BIT to occur. It is neither a condition stated in that provision, nor is it, more importantly, stated as a Contracting Party\u2019s obligation under the BIT. Article 6 of the BIT is on breach for expropriation or nationalization. It is not on any other potential ancillary obligation as the conduct of negotiation based on good faith. Such obligation is just not there.8\n\nThe Tribunal may not ignore the clear assessment of Professor Abi-Saab in its Dissenting Opinion of February 19, 2015 (para. 115): \"There is no mention in this text of an obligation to negotiate compensation.\"\n\n22.\n\nGiven that the Tribunal has not decided upon the alleged breach of Article 6, the presentation of submissions of the Parties as to the factual allegations to be made in that respect remains open. This is all the more so as the Tribunal has not declared the proceeding closed according to Arbitration Rule 38(1). This further means that the factual assessment underlying the ruling on the matter of good faith negotiation, while decisive in this latter respect, is not precluding Respondent from arguing and submitting evidence as a defence to presently outstanding claims on liability and damages, if any. Even when considering such ruling as binding in any way, such effect does not extend to the underlying reasons, which are subject to reexamination in respect of any other issue on the merits, for which such reasons or facts may be relevant.9 Claimants seem to share this view when stating that the Tribunal \"may therefore wish to address this matter as part of its quantum determination\".10 In light of such an assessment, it would appear to me that consideration of Respondent\u2019s Application for Reconsideration could be deferred at a later stage when the issue of an alleged breach of the BIT is dealt with in terms encompassing all of the elements pertinent under Article 6 of the BIT.11 In this respect, I am respectfully dissenting from my Colleagues\u2019 majority position that the matter shall now be decided.\n\nAnother illustration may be given in respect of para. 402 of the Majority Merits Decision where it is emphasized that the Tribunal \"does not at this stage make a finding in respect of the relevance, if any, of the compensation formulas included in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements to the determination of the quantum compensation payable in this case\", while it had decided that there was not \"any evidence that in this period [April-June 2007], the Venezuelan representatives brought the compensation formulas in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements into the negotiation\" (para. 400).\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter of January 22, 2016.\n\nIn the same vein, consideration may be given to the \"several issues\" the Tribunal referred to but did not propose to decide (para. 334), nor identify in its Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits and which are part of the \"all other questions\" reserved for further examination under letter g) of the *dispositif* and not related to *quantum*  or costs.\n\n23.\n\nI will then turn to the question that represents the focus of Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration and of the Majority\u2019s Denial of Power for Review.\n\n*IV. Applicable Rules on the Binding Effect of ICSID Decisions*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIt would seem superfluous to recall the applicable rules to this proceeding. They are, of course, the provision of the ICSID Convention (Art. 36-52) and those contained in the Arbitration Rules.\n\n25.\n\nIt appears useful, however, to add the set of rules adopted by the ICSID Secretariat based on its administrative power and observed by ICSID Tribunals and Annulment Committees as if they were rules having a normative basis while in reality they have normative effects only. These effects are a reality prevailing over Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, stating that any question of procedure not answered by the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules shall be decided by the Tribunal.\n\n26.\n\nThis can be illustrated by the most famous of such rules, which is the Secretariat\u2019s position, adopted by Mr. Shihata (Secretary General at the time) that Decisions affirming a Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction do not qualify as an award and therefore cannot be addressed through an application for annulment filed after they had been rendered.12 This was a policy decision of the Centre, the pros and cons are not to be discussed here. It can hardly be disputed that there does not exist any provision in the Convention or in the Arbitration Rules providing for such a solution. The Rules merely address the case of a negative decision on jurisdiction, which has to take the form of an award (Rule 41(6)). The hypothesis of an affirmative incidental ruling on jurisdiction is not addressed by the Convention and the Rules.13 The Centre\u2019s position, while not based on any norm in the Convention and the Arbitration Rules, is nevertheless a norm in its effects, because it is put in efficient operation through the refusal of the Centre to provide for the constitution of an Annulment Committee in case an applicant would like to request that the Decision adopting a Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction shall be reviewed by such a Committee. There is nothing else to be mentioned as the foundation of the refusal by the Centre to submit such application to an annulment proceeding than \"the standard practice\" actually followed.\n\nChristoph Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2nd ed., Cambridge 2009, Art. 41 No. 26, Art. 52 No. 66.\n\nThis seems also implicit in Arbitration Rule 41(2), authorizing the Tribunal to raise a jurisdictional issue \"on its own initiative\", and this \"at any stage of the proceedings\". While the wording would permit to rise a jurisdictional matter whatever decisions have already been made, this is not the prevailing understanding of the purpose of the rule.\n\n27.\n\nOne of the side rules that the Centre had to add later was the instruction given to tribunals prepared to deliver their Award *(i.e.* the final decision on the merits) to incorporate the Decision on Jurisdiction in their final ruling. In most cases this is made by a statement included in the procedural history representing the opening part of the Award14. In some cases, the incorporation takes a physical form, when the Decision on Jurisdiction is annexed to the Award. The objective of this practice is to ensure that the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction is subject to the scope of review of the Annulment Committee, which requires the Decision to be included in an Award. It seems to go without saying that there is not to be found any legal rule requiring such incorporation of a decision that should have an autonomous standing. However, it is the result of a norm in effect, as adopted and enforced by the Centre.\n\nThe place of such statement in the part on procedural history is the most unsuitable solution. Indeed, the statement has for its purpose to introduce the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction as a *ratio decidendi* for its Award that closes the proceeding. Its purpose is precisely not to merely recall a piece of historical importance, but to state a decision in the Award itself.\n\n28.\n\nOne other of the rules of such kind is the instruction given to ICSID Tribunals not to declare the proceeding closed pursuant to Rule 38(1) of the Arbitration Rule before the proceeding leading to the Award *(i.e.* the final decision on the merits) is to be handed down. This instruction is diversely handled by ICSID Tribunals, several of which declaring the proceedings closed when the decision contains a ruling affirming the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The instruction, respectively what is more candidly called \"the practice\" or \"the standard practice\" has been observed in the instant case. Indeed, the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of September 3, 2013 does not contain a declaration that the proceeding was closed.15\n\nWhile this is explained by the reason that this decision represents a partial step only in the proceeding on the merits, it seems to be nevertheless confusing when the decision is labeled as covering \"the Merits\" when in fact it covers (in part) liability only.\n\n29.\n\nThe reason for adopting this \"practice\" appears to be a formal one. Arbitration Rule 38(1) requires that the proceeding shall be declared closed \"when the presentation of the case by the parties is completed\". So, in a situation where a ruling has been made on liability, the parties\u2019 presentation is not completed until they have argued about the ensuing damages, which means that it cannot be affirmed in the decision on liability that the proceeding is closed. However, one understands from the outset that Arbitration Rule 38(1) does not envisage the case of partial or interim decisions on jurisdiction or on the merits. While the Centre\u2019s position has its merits, it leaves in a field of uncertainty the consequences of the omission of such declaration in such non-final decisions, albeit in a form adapted to the limited scope of the content of such decisions.\n\n30.\n\nAs will be seen below, these rules of \"practice\" are put into question in the instant case, when it comes to analyze their effects in front of the applicable rules of law, as contained in the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules. While such rules of a character of \"norms in effect\" are based on the Centre\u2019s power to administrate ICSID proceedings and therefore to be observed, it has to be bom in mind that they cannot prevail over the Law as contained in the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, all the more so they are questionable in respect of Article 44 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*V. The Conclusion of the Majority\u2019s Reconsideration Decision and of its Renewed Version*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe first focus must be to take notice of the decisional part of the Decision (the *dispositif).* It states that the Tribunal \"does not have the power to reconsider the Decision of 3 September 2013\". The Renewed Version confirms this Decision, adding that Respondent\u2019s Application is dismissed.\n\n32.\n\nThe Majority Reconsideration Decision declines making any statement on the substance of the matter submitted before it through Respondent\u2019s Application. It has rendered a decision purely procedural in nature.\n\n33.\n\nThe key issue is whether, as contended by Respondent, the Decision on Liability, called \"Decision on the Merits\" is still open for reconsideration. This implies a reexamination of the reasons underlying the Majority Decision on Reconsideration and its Renewed Version, and consideration for proper application of the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules.\n\n34.\n\nIt is not clear to me whether Professor Georges Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion was filed with the Tribunal early enough to be considered by the Majority in its First Decision; it was submitted largely on time to be addressed in its Renewed Version. However, the Majority disregarded the content of Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Opinion entirely. While I have greatest respect for my Colleague\u2019s position, and regret that he had to leave the Tribunal for reasons of health, I have chosen to find my own way of reasoning that is in many parts parallel to the reasons he has given.16 In doing so, I certainly share Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s views and feel strongly that his call for Justice deserves the utmost attention. Instead of repeating what he has so remarkably said, I declare to incorporate his Dissent into the present Opinion, to the extent it covers the same subject matter.\n\nSee also Brower/Henin, *op.cit.**,*** p. 67, noting that \"Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion rightly points out that the majority\u2019s Decision on Reconsideration underplays the specific characteristics of the ICSID system and its *lex specialis.\".*\n\n35.\n\nA further reminder is about the scope of my present examination. What the Tribunal is actually asked to do is to reconsider its position as to the admissibility of a request for reconsideration of the Decision on Liability. Respondent declares that it is not necessary for this Tribunal now to revisit the merits of its Application and of the Majority Merits Decision. While this may be correct, it is nevertheless beyond doubt that a decision to allow such revisit requires a demonstration of a certain degree of flaws contained in the decision to be reconsidered, of a gravity that requires under elementary standards of natural justice or other standards of a similar nature that the decision be put under review.\n\n36.\n\nRespondent invokes in this respect the occurrence of \"gross miscarriage of justice\" and effects given to \"patently false representations\" on part of Claimants. I assume that the Tribunal is faced with a **prima facie** showing of such deficiencies. The Majority Reconsideration Decision does not state otherwise, and while Claimants\u2019 reject Respondent\u2019s Request strongly, they do not offer evidence showing that such a **prima facie** view is clearly beyond any reasonable understanding.\n\n37.\n\nRespondent\u2019s submission of August 10, 2015 argues that the Tribunal decided certain aspects of the merits of the instant case in committing \"obvious factual, legal and logical errors\", that representations made by Claimants before the Tribunal \"had been completely false\", and that Claimants \"had not even challenged\" evidence presented by Respondent. It is added that Respondent\u2019s Application for Reconsideration considers as \"of particular relevance\" in this respect \"cables from the U.S. Embassy released after the hearing in this case in 2010\".\n\n38.\n\nNo more precision is provided in respect of the date when these cables were released and made available to Respondent. In its First Brief dated October 28, 2013, it was stated that those reports were \"published long after the hearing in June 2010\" (No. 4, 38). No indication is given what the word \"long\" means. Claimants have set the date of the coming out to the public of the cables on August 30, 2011.17 I was not able to identify in the documents whether the relevant facts were known to Respondent and to the Tribunal before rendering the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits on September 3, 2013.181 note however that the Majority Reconsideration Decision envisages the hypothesis of a revision of its forthcoming Award on the point actually under dispute (para. 23), and that Claimants approve in their letter of August 12, 2015 that revision would be one available way for post-award remedy, which would mean that the facts to be invoked for such revision would have been unknown to the Respondent and the Tribunal when the decision was rendered (cf. Art. 51(1) ICSID Convention, Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c)(ii)). This point requires clarification, as Claimants have also strongly submitted that Respondent\u2019s application does not offer any window for a revision.19\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission on Respondent\u2019s Application for Reconsideration of October 28, 2013, No. 23.\n\nIt seems premature for me to draw today a negative interference from the Tribunal\u2019s sentence in its Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits that it \"does not have before it any evidence at all of the proposals made by Venezuela in this final period\" (para. 400), statement which is then explained in further detail.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission on Respondent\u2019s Application for Reconsideration of October 28, 2013, No. 21-25; Claimants\u2019 Second Submission on Respondent\u2019s Application for Reconsideration of November 25, 2013, No. 26-31; Claimants\u2019 letter of January 22, 2016.\n\n*VI. The Majority\u2019s First Reason*\n---------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal states correctly that \"in accordance with practice\", the decisions contained in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability \"are to be incorporated in the Award\".20 It then adds that it is established \"as a matter of principle and practice\" that such decisions resolve points in dispute between the Parties and have therefore *res judicata* effect. No reference to any provision of law is given in support of such position. The Tribunal merely quotes a decision rendered in the case *Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary21,* stating that such decisions \"are intended to be final\" and therefore not to be revisited in any later phase of the arbitration proceedings.22\n\nMajority Reconsideration Decision, para. 21.\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID/ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability of November 30, 2012, para. 10.1.\n\nMajority Reconsideration Decision, para. 21; Renewed Version, para. 31.\n\n40.\n\nThe use of the terms *res judicata* is subject to questions. This concept applies to situations where the same claim decided between the same parties and based on the same cause of action is raised in a distinct or successive proceeding. This notion does not apply to decisions to be made before the same court or tribunal in the same proceeding.\n\n41.\n\nI note that the decision rendered in the case *Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary* does not rely on any precedent or norm of law, but merely indicates that the view expressed is \"the Tribunal\u2019s view\". The decision was not intended to produce precedential effect for itself. The Tribunal wanted its holding to be limited to the particular case it was ruling upon.23 It has also to be noted that the term of art *res judicata* has not been used.24\n\nCf. Andrew McDougal/Samy Markbaoui, ConocoPhillips Petrozuata, ConcocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B. V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Journal of World Investment and Trade 15 (2014) p. 1062-1069(1068).\n\nThe Majority Reconsideration Decision (para. 21) and the Renewed Version (para. 31) both rely on the *Electrabel* Decision in support of the principle of *res judicata,* omitting to note that this term does not appear in the Decision.\n\n42.\n\nAn interesting comparison can be made with the more recent Award rendered in the *Quiborax* Case. Two members of this Tribunal had been part of the *Electrabel* Tribunal25. In this case, the Respondent raised in the merits phase a jurisdictional objection that it had not invoked during the preceding phase that was terminated by the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction. The Tribunal\u2019s Award dismissed Respondent\u2019s attempt to raise again the question whether Claimants\u2019 investments were made in accordance with Bolivian Law. However, it accepted an exception, stating that: \"Only the allegation of an illegality that was unknown to Bolivia during the jurisdictional phase may justify reopening the matter at the merit stage.\"26 Thus, no **res judicata** was retained or even mentioned. Bolivia raised a number of other objections to jurisdiction at the merits stage, in respect of which the Tribunal assessed that \"there is no reason that can justify reopening the jurisdictional issues at this stage, assuming this were at all possible\".27 In this last note, **res judicata** is implicitly mentioned as an issue, however without using the term, which is not elevated to a *ratio decidendi.*\n\nProfessors Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler and Brigitte Stern.\n\n*Quiborax S.A. and Non Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID/ARB/06/2, Award of September 16, 2015, para. 130. The Majority is therefore wrong in stating in its Renewed Version that the *Quiborax* Tribunal did not question the binding character of the earlier ruling or its \"res *judicata* effect\" (para. 33). The *Quiborax* Tribunal accepted to examine the objection and rejected it. In the instant case, Respondent requests nothing more than that its Application may be heard and examined.\n\nCf. Award, para. 541. Similarly, the Tribunal in *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Republic of Argentina*  ICSID/ARB/01/8, Award of May 12, 2005, stated simply that certain issues dealt with at the jurisdictional stage raised by Respondent in relation to the merits \"were decided upon at that stage and will not be reopened in this Award\" (para. 126). The principle of *res judicata* has not been mentioned.\n\n43.\n\nHaving affirmed to be bound by the so-called **res judicata** effect of its decision of 2013 on Respondent\u2019s violation of an obligation to negotiate in good faith, the Tribunal then asks in its Reconsideration Decision whether the provisions of the Convention and the Rules make a difference to this position.28 It may have been more convincing to ask the questions the other way round. The question was whether the Convention or the Rules take any position on the effects given to such a decision before it is incorporated in the Award and if, in light of these elements of law, the principle of **res judicata** applies.\n\nMajority Reconsideration Decision, para. 22\n\n44.\n\nIn a first reason, the Tribunal does not find in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention and in Arbitration Rule 38(2) any element that would allow deviating from the above mentioned principle of *res judicata,* which is also said to be based on *practice* as if such practice would be binding upon the Tribunal. The first provision acknowledges the Tribunal\u2019s power to address procedural issues not dealt with in the Convention or the Rules. The Tribunal acknowledges that this provision is designed to enable gaps in the procedure to be filled. It concludes from this that this provision \"cannot be seen as conferring a broad unexpressed power of substantive decision\" (para. 22, *in fine).* In so stating, the Tribunal does not address Respondent\u2019s request nor examine the requirements underlying Article 44 in its own admission. Why should the question be addressed whether Article 44 confers a \"power of substantive decision\" when the Tribunal states a few line before that this Article is about \"procedural issues\". And why should the non-existence of a \"substantive power of decision\" in Article 44 be sufficient to deny the examination of an Application that, as filed by Respondent, is on the procedural issue whether a decision rendered before may be re-examined or not?\n\n45.\n\nIn its Renewed Version, the Majority develops the confusion in slightly different terms. It reaffirms that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention relates to \"a question of procedure\" or to the \"conduct of the proceedings\", and then affirms that the power to reconsider rulings as invoked by Respondent appears to be a \"very different power\", without further definition, except the conclusion that the \"ordinary meaning of Article 44\" does not appear \"to include the power which the Respondent seeks\", which is \"a power of a substantive kind\" (para. 23). It also notes that Article 44 applies to \"practical instances\" that \"are of a quite different order from the broad power of substantive reconsideration which the Respondent invokes in this case\" (para. 28). The Majority then recalls that Article 44 does \"not deal with matters of substance\", referring to the history of the Convention, which is entirely irrelevant in relation to the matter raised in the instant case, which has not been examined at that time. The Majority does again not give attention to the content of terms like \"procedure\" and \"substance\". It further invokes the \"role and character of rules of procedure\" to which Article 44 is confined and concludes that \"it would be remarkable\" if this provision would be understood \"to include the power which the Respondent invokes here\" (para. 24). The statement is surprising: the mere fact that a certain understanding of Article 44 would lead to a result being \"remarkable\" serves as justification for the dismissal of the proposal. It may be sufficient here to mention the procedural decisions made by the *Abaclat* Tribunal29 to understand that Article 44 allows going far above matters of residual and little procedural impact as the Majority affirms (para. 24). It appears also remarkable that the Majority does not consider Arbitration Rule 19, instructing the Tribunal to \"make the orders required for the conduct of the proceeding\", without any restriction.30 Both provisions, Article 44 of the Convention and Rule 19, are to be understood as the procedural addition to the principle stated in Article 42(2) of the Convention, prohibiting the Tribunal to adopt a finding of *non liquet* on the ground of silence or obscurity of the law. There is thus no power given to an ICSID Tribunal to decline exercising its mission on a purported lack of power that no rule supports.\n\n*Abaclat* et al. *c. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 4, 2011, paras. 515-521, concluding that the \"ICSID Framework\" does not contain a \"qualified silence\" excluding the adoption of appropriate procedural rules to deal with \"mass claims\".\n\nThe primary addressee of this provision is clearly the Tribunal. In its Renewed Version, the Majority disposes from considering Rule 19 because Respondent did not seek therein support for its power of reconsideration (para. 36, *in fine). Iura novit curia* does not exist. Respondent was not most explicit, indeed. A reference to Rule 19 can be found in a quote in footnote 125 of Respondent\u2019s Second Brief pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Request of October 1, 2013, dated November 25, 2013.\n\n46.\n\nIn relation to Arbitration Rule 38(2), the Tribunal states that it has a \"much more limited function\", without explaining what that function should be and why it should be limited. It is merely added that this Rule, together with Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, are of an essentially procedural character, which appears from the cases on which Respondent relies. This position does not respond in any way to the Application before the Tribunal, which is, precisely, procedural in nature.\n\n47.\n\nIt is worth considering in more detail Arbitration Rule 38, paragraph 2, which is considered not applicable in the instant case, given is \"much more limited function\". Arbitration Rule 38 states as follows on the matter of \"Closure of the Proceeding\":\n\n\"(1) When the presentation of the case by the parties is completed, the proceeding shall be declared closed.\n\n(2) Exceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, reopen the proceeding on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points.\"\n\n48.\n\nIf the second provision is not applicable, this is not because it has a limited function (not defined by the Tribunal anyhow), but because the proceeding in the instant case has never been declared closed. No such declaration is contained in the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits.31 Therefore, the Tribunal should have been lead to conclude that *a fortiori* a party addressing the Tribunal in the instant case with a request to proceed in a certain manner is not constraint to demonstrate that new evidence presents a \"decisive factor\", or is showing \"a vital need for clarification on certain specific points\". Indeed, the proceedings are still ongoing and have not been closed in any of its aspects.32\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission on Respondent\u2019s Application for Reconsideration of October 28, 2013, No. 15, *in fine**,*** omits observing this point when arguing that the stage to which Rule 38(2) refers has passed. In fact, it has never been reached.\n\nEven if Rule 38(2) would be pertinent, allowing reopening of the proceeding in light of new evidence, the effects on the substance of the clarification requested from the Tribunal are crystal clear and cannot be reduced to an \"essentially procedural character\" as the Majority affirms in its Renewed Version (para. 36).\n\n49.\n\nIt may also be noted that Article 43 of the ICSID Convention states that the Tribunal may call upon the Parties to produce documents or other evidence \"at any stage of the proceedings\", without making any reservation for the case where a matter had already been assessed in an interim or partial decision. If such a decision would have to constitute a complete barrier for any reconsideration, the drafter of the provision would have undoubtedly amended the provision accordingly.\n\n50.\n\nIn this respect as well, the Centre\u2019s position on certain regulatory aspects causes problem. This can be illustrated with a decision on jurisdiction that is not an award but becomes an award once it is incorporated in the Award subject to annulment. Up to that moment, the decision is not final and is sometimes not treated as such \"in practice\". Indeed, it happens frequently that an initial decision on jurisdiction is, during the merits phase, subject to further refinements or adaptations in relation to its scope *ratione materiae.* Sometimes, decisions on jurisdiction contain an express reservation in this respect. This does not cause any problem in practice, and rightly so. Nevertheless, the Tribunal proceeding in such a way is necessarily starting from a position where it does not feel its decision on jurisdiction representing *res judicata.*\n\n51.\n\nLet us take another hypothesis. A Tribunal is faced with two claims. It decides in a first move that it has jurisdiction about claim 1, but not on claim 2. In such a case, Arbitration Rule 41(6) does not apply and no award is rendered. Later, in the merits phase, the Tribunal understands that its position in relation to claim 2 is wrong and it affirms jurisdiction equally in this respect and renders the final Award. This Award deals with jurisdiction in respect of claim 2 and it incorporates the earlier decision in respect of claim 1. What happened to the initial decision denying jurisdiction over claim 2? It simply disappeared from the proceeding, showing that it was not *res judicata.* The Committee sitting over an annulment request will not be seized with the matter, because that decision is not brought before it. The Committee may conclude that the Tribunal was wrong in affirming its jurisdiction over claim 2 and therefore pronounce the Award\u2019s annulment. In so doing, it does not restore the first jurisdictional decision in respect of claim 2.\n\n52.\n\nAt this stage, the conclusion is simple: There is no rule precluding the Tribunal from reviewing its Decision affirming Jurisdiction.33 The *Helnan* Tribunal decided accordingly, referring to Schreuer, noting that while Respondent\u2019s objection to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction \"could have been raised sooner\", it was understandable that it was raised within the merits phase of the proceedings only.34 The *Tokios Tokel\u00e8s* Tribunal disposed of the principle as a purely facultative indication, not compelling the Tribunal to reconsider an issue on jurisdiction.35\n\n\"... there appears to be nothing to stop a tribunal from supplementing, rectifying, interpreting or revising a preliminary decision on jurisdiction informally while the case is still pending before it.\" Christoph Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2nd ed., Cambridge 2009, Art. 41 No. 24. The Renewed Version comports the extraordinary omission of this statement, while Schreuer\u2019s Commentary is invoked for the proposition that Article 44 deals only with the power to rule on matters of procedural character, not including the power invoked by Respondent (para. 23).\n\n*Helnan International Hotels A/S v. The Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID/ARB/05/19, Award of July 3, 2008, para. 112\n\n.\n\n*Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine,* ICSID/ARB/02/18, Award of July 26, 2007, para. 98: \"The Tribunal notes that it could have dealt with the contention simply recording that by virtue of the treatment of the same point in the Decision on Jurisdiction the principles of *res judicata* and issue estoppel excluded any right to raise it again, but in the circumstances it has been thought right to reconsider the question, with the same result as before.\"\n\n53.\n\nA similar reasoning applies when an initial (partial) decision on liability has been rendered. The aforementioned \"standard practice\" makes it easier than it would be if Arbitration Rule 38(2) would apply. The proceeding has not been declared closed and, therefore, is still open. This does not mean that the Tribunal could be requested at any time to revisit its decision. Such a decision stands by its authority and the Tribunal\u2019s position that it has fully examined the matter. It is \"intended to be final\", but it is not final yet. This leaves open, by necessity, a margin for a party\u2019s submission based on certain grounds of major importance that the Tribunal shall not dismiss based on arguments denying its power to do so.\n\n54.\n\nLet us assume that the Tribunal has acted accordingly and modified its decision on liability, later incorporated in that revised format into the final Award. In such a case, the initial decision on liability will not be submitted for examination by the annulment Committee that has no power whatsoever to restore what may be wrongly argued as that decision\u2019s *res judicata* effect. The Committee might annul the new decision, but it cannot do more. Therefore, the **res judicata** value of intermediate decisions on jurisdiction or the merits is inexistent. A note of caution in respect of a principled and abstract call for **res judicata** had been voiced already by the *Amco II* Tribunal in 198 8.36 The approach is different and more suitable if *res judicata* would be invoked not as a categorical bar to any reconsideration, but for the purpose of affirming the Tribunal\u2019s authority to confirm its position upon reflection in such a way that parties shall be advised not to disturb the proceedings by applications for reconsideration not based on strong grounds.\n\n\"It is by no means clear that the basic trend in international law is to accept reasoning, preliminary or incidental determination as part of what constitutes *res judicata. \"* *AMCO v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID/ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction of May 10, 1988, para. 32.\n\n55.\n\nA further observation may be added. Indeed, even when considering an interim decision on liability having effects of *res judicata,* this applies only to the decisional part of such a ruling, not to the underlying reasons. In the instant case, it would seem that when assuming, on the one hand, that Respondent\u2019s liability in certain aspects has been finally decided, it may also appear, on the other hand, that the facts, as they were retained as evidence in the decision can be revisited during any further part of the proceeding in relation to other items relevant for the merits. In the instant case, it may be that in one way or the other, a factual pattern that led the Tribunal to conclude that Respondent\u2019s liability is affirmed, will also be argued as an element for decision in respect of the determination of alleged damages that are derived from a line of facts interrelated by reasons of causality, and which have as their starting point the facts that have been retained in the framework of the decision on liability.37 If these facts are proven to be wrong, as contended by Respondent, the Tribunal may no longer be able to take them as a basis for an award on damages. The \"new\" facts, as alleged and evidenced, will have to be retained, with the effect that the conclusion on the matter of damages risks to become inconsistent with the reasons and the conclusion underlying the prior decision on liability, which, in the instant case, was based on circumstances relating to part of the negotiations on compensation only. This would become a critical issue when it comes to rule upon the question whether this latter decision shall be incorporated into the Final Award.\n\nThe matter is debated in the briefs on damages: Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Quantum, August 18, 2014 (paras. 3, footnote 1, 36, 136, 142-149, 171-185; Claimant\u2019s Reply on Quantum, octoberl3, 2014, paras. 10, 78-105; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on Quantum, January 7, 2015, paras. 13-15, 280-327. Respondent\u2019s letter of September 16, 2013, seems to touch upon the issue.\n\n*VII. The Majority\u2019s Second Reason*\n-----------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nIn a further step, the Tribunal turns to its second reason for its conclusion that it cannot find in the pertinent provisions the \"source of a power to reconsider\".38\n\nMajority Reconsideration Decision, para. 23.\n\n57.\n\nIt is based on the assertion that:\n\n\"The overall structure and the detailed provisions of the ICSID Convention were plainly designed to provide for review or actions in respect of decisions of a tribunal once the Award was rendered. There is no gap to be filled by the power proposed here.\"\n\n58.\n\nThis statement is of an extraordinary simplicity, stating that there should not be put any blame on a Tribunal not performing with satisfaction because the matter can always be cured once the Award has been rendered. Indeed, the Tribunal does not find any provision in Section 3 of Part IV of the ICSID Convention \"even hinting at such power\", and nothing more results from Section 4 dealing succinctly with the Award itself. The final points state the essence of this reasoning:\n\n\"And it is only in Section 5 that powers are conferred on the Tribunal to interpret and revise the Award and on an *ad hoc* Committee to annul an Award on prescribed grounds. It is in those ways and those alone that decisions such as that in September 2013 can be questioned, changed or set aside.\"\n\nIn closer relation to the instant case it is then stated:\n\n\"Those various post award remedies are, of course, available to both Parties. Those provisions and that structure exclude the possibility of the proposed powers of reconsideration being read into the Convention. The reading of the Convention is also supported by the drafting history mentioned above (paragraph 18) \"39\n\nThe Tribunal relies on quotes from Claimants\u2019 Second Submission that are taken in most part from their statement and not from the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires.* Claimants merely mentioned the Convention\u2019s drafters stressing the \"binding character of any decision by [an arbitral tribunal] on preliminary questions or merits\" (referring to *History of the ICSID Convention,* Volume II-1 (1968), page 408, CL-269). Claimants\u2019 quote is misleading. It does not originate from the \"drafters of the Convention\", but from the Chairman of a meeting of legal experts. And it refers to a comment having the purpose to \"emphasize the distinction between the ruling of a tribunal and a recommendation by the conciliation commission concerning competence\" (*ib).* In any event, any statement that would have been made at the time of the Convention\u2019s drafting is of little relevance since the Centre has taken the position that an affirmative Decision on Jurisdiction cannot have the quality of an award.\n\n59.\n\nThese statements are not correct. Firstly, the assertion that the provisions on post-award remedies exclude the possibility of the Tribunal\u2019s proposed powers is wrong because these provisions contain not any hint of a rule in such a direction.40 In addition, the mere existence of post-award remedies does not have any effect *a contrario,* excluding any remedy during an on-going proceeding that would allow the examination of a request of a kind as filed by Respondent. It may suffice to look at Arbitration Rule 38(2) where such a remedy is provided; it has been stated above that such access to the Tribunal\u2019s scrutiny is given *a fortiori* when a proceeding has not been declared closed as in the instant case.\n\nNo reason is given further on whether and why such exclusion could be derived from the \u00ab overall structure \u00bb of the ICSID Convention. Such a concept is void of substance and pure verbalism used in an attempt to fill in gaps in a reasoning that has no basis in the provisions contained in such structure, which are the only ones which count. The Renewed Version further invokes the \"framework\" provided by the Convention and its \"clear structure\" (paras. 25, 30), not providing even an allusion to what these terms should mean as a matter of law.\n\n60.\n\nSecondly, the reader observes that it is affirmed that the various post-award remedies are available to both Parties. The statement is not elaborated any further41, to the exception of the indication given above that this involves interpretation, revision and annulment of an Award. It is or must be understood that such a statement can make, and is intended to make sense, in relation to Respondent\u2019s Application for reconsideration only. The Tribunal offers not any element of examination allowing to know whether this position is correct. It is not.\n\nNor is it supported by any reason given in Claimants\u2019 letter dated August 12, 2015, where the Tribunal\u2019s words are copied in a footnote and not supplied by any comment.\n\n61.\n\nIt may be recalled again that Respondent\u2019s Application is about the reconsideration of the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits on specific items that are identified. This request has been characterized by the Tribunal\u2019s Decision as being beyond its powers. The question is then whether such ruling can be submitted to one of the aforementioned post-award remedies. It cannot.\n\n62.\n\nThere is certainly no point in considering interpretation as a remedy in this respect.\n\n63.\n\nThe ground based on the proper constitution of the Tribunal is contentious between the Parties but is not relevant for present purposes and not to be commented by me in any event.\n\n64.\n\nAs reasons have been given, there is no point in invoking the ground based on the absence of reasons provided. And the Tribunal has certainly not envisaged that this ground may be relevant in case an *ad hoc* Committee would consider that no reason have been given because those actually given are all wrong.\n\n65.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine how the Tribunal could consider a possible application of the ground that it had manifestly exceeded its powers in relation to its decision stating that it has no power to proceed with Respondent\u2019s Request. The argument would have to be that in stating that it has no power the Tribunal exceeded its power to make such an assessment. The Tribunal will certainly not want to offer any argument that it acted accordingly and suggest to Respondent the expectation that it will be able to invoke such a ground for annulment. Such a perspective is left for pure speculation.\n\n66.\n\nThe only ground that may be of some relevance is that the Tribunal may have committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. However, the Tribunal affirms and explains that no such rule of procedure exists or needs to be adopted for the purpose of filling a gap in the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules. How could the Tribunal affirm the existence of a remedy on a ground that it denies simultaneously?\n\n67.\n\nIn respect of these both latter grounds for annulment, it is more than surprising that they are offered to the Parties as a remedy while the Tribunal refuses to proceed with the appropriate remedy itself. If the Tribunal affirms today that a forthcoming Award can be subject to annulment on the ground that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers or has disregarded a fundamental rule of procedure, it does not do anything else than affirming that this is what it is actually doing. Therefore, either these grounds have no foundation in the instant case and no annulment can be reached, or they, or one of them, are actually reached, which necessarily means that at the actual stage, the Tribunal has the power to proceed and/or has to apply the applicable fundamental rule of procedure. This is enough to demonstrate that the Tribunal\u2019s argument that what it might actually be doing wrong can be cured in a later proceeding on annulment is equally wrong. The Tribunal shall state the Law and not defer the Parties to a remedy-proceeding stating that the Tribunal got it wrong.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal includes in the list of available remedies a request for revision. Such a request requires, pursuant to Article 51(1) ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c)(ii) that:\n\n\"the change sought in the award, the discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, and evidence that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant, and that the applicant\u2019s ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence;\"\n\n69.\n\nIn order to apply this provision, at least by analogy, it is required that the facts to be invoked for such revision were unknown to the Respondent and the Tribunal when the decision was rendered. As stated above, I am not certain whether such a requirement is met in the instant case.\n\n70.\n\nThe situation would become particularly untenable when a case for revision could seriously be envisaged. When the Tribunal affirms in its Majority Reconsideration Decision that this remedy is, \"of course\", available to both Parties42, how could it be envisaged that the very same Tribunal, seized with the application for revision (Arbitration Rule 51), would then decide otherwise?\n\nA position shared by Claimants in their letter dated 12 August 2015.\n\n71.\n\nIn any event, the wording of the provision tells that no revision is available. Indeed, the decisive point in time is the date when the Award was rendered. This date is clearly situated in the future, when the damage phase is closed, certainly not before the end of 2016. Therefore, there will be no point whatsoever that the Respondent will have an opportunity to proceed with an application for revision, invoking facts that were revealed in 2010 or 2011 and certainly before the final Award will be delivered. And if access to the remedy of revision is determined as it is under the Rules, this is why the parties must be given the opportunity to present the facts relevant for their case during the proceedings of the arbitral tribunal, either until the date when the proceeding is declared closed, or even thereafter but then under the restrictions contained in Arbitration Rule 38(2). If anyone would like to rely on the \"overall structure\" of the system, that is the best place to do it.\n\n72.\n\nIn conclusion, not only does the alleged existence of post-award remedies not imply *a contrario* that a party is left with no means for reconsideration during an ongoing proceeding. More importantly, such conclusion, even if considered correct, has no basis in the instant case because no such remedy will be available to Respondent.\n\n73.\n\nGoing one step further in this analysis, it appears that the Tribunal refused to make any assessment about Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration because it did not see any provision in the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules that would allow the Tribunal to so proceed.43 This statement affirms that the Tribunal is faced with a case of silence of the Law, which implies that it cannot take a power nowhere that is not provided by the Law. Such a conclusion is not compatible with Article 42(2) of the ICSID Convention, which states firmly that the Tribunal may not bring in a finding of *non liquet* on the ground of silence or obscurity of the law. As explained above, this provision is supplemented in matters of procedure by Article 44 instructing the Tribunal in such a case that it \"shall decide the question\", a direction also given by Arbitration Rule 19. None of these provisions prohibits entering into an examination on reconsideration of a pre-award decision. There is no qualified silence to such an effect. The Tribunal, conducted by its Majority, fails to comply with its mission when declining to affirm its power to deal with Respondent\u2019s Application.\n\nMajority Reconsideration Decision, para. 22 ; Renewed Version, para. 27, *in fine.*\n\n74.\n\nThe matter here under consideration has been dealt with in some detail in the ICSID Tribunal\u2019s *Decision on Ecuador \u2019s Reconsideration Motion* of April 10, 2015, rendered in the case *Perenco Ecuador Limited v. The Republic of Ecuador.44* The Tribunal took into consideration Ecuador\u2019s Motion and, after careful examination, decided to dismiss it. The Tribunal had considered, among others, the Majority Decision on Reconsideration rendered in the instant case, together with Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissenting Opinion. In rejecting Ecuador\u2019s Motion, the Tribunal examined all potentially applicable rules of the Convention and the Arbitration Rules for the purpose of providing an answer to the question \"whether the Tribunal can, in the absence of an express procedural rule in the Convention or the Rules (or agreement of the Parties), reopen and amend the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability\".45 Like the Majority in the instant case, it did not find such a rule, and consequently, dismissed the Motion for the reason that \"there is no power vested in it which would allow it to engage in the exercise requested of it\". This reasoning is categorical and regrettably simplistic.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Limited v. The Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Ecuador\u2019s Reconsideration Motion of April 10, 2015.\n\nDecision, para. 23, *in fine.*\n\n75.\n\nDepending on how the relevant question is framed, the outcome is determined from the outset. If the question is asked whether there is a rule available providing expressly for a possibility for review of certain prior decisions, the answer is negative. When, on the other hand, the question asked is whether there exists a rule preventing the Tribunal from taking such a decision for opening of such a review, the answer cannot be negative because no rule does so provide. Another position can be adopted on the only basis of *a contrario* interpretation, which, however, is wholly unsupported by the applicable rules. This was the *Perenco* Tribunal\u2019s approach, asserting that because no express provision does exist, such power is nonexistent. Nonetheless, the Tribunal did not point to any provision that would not allow such power to be exercised.\n\n76.\n\nThe *Perenco* Tribunal argued specifically by reference to Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, which sets a very high standard for the possibility of a revision of an award. It draws from this provision the conclusion that it is \"the only article of the Convention that authorizes a tribunal to revise its award\", which does not fit Ecuador\u2019s motion and therefore \"essentially puts an end to the Motion\"46. The inconsistency of this statement jumps at the eyes: Article 51 applies to the revision of awards and has nothing to say about a revision or reconsideration of a decision preliminary to an award. Similarly, the Tribunal states that reopening of such a decision \"is not to be inferred from the existence of an annulment procedure\"47, which means that a tribunal cannot \"second-guess itself as to whether it has manifestly exceeded its powers, seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and so on\"48. Again, any annulment procedure applies to awards exclusively, whereas the issue under discussion is about interim or preliminary decisions.\n\nDecision, para. 52.\n\nDecision, para. 34.\n\nDecision, para. 33. See also para. 24, relying on Article 53 of the Convention - a provision that refers to awards and has nothing to say about the nature and effects of pre-award decisions.\n\n77.\n\nMaking a step further, the Tribunal asserts that the restrictive rule on revision of awards demonstrates that when a tribunal \"has decided issues before it, its decision becomes res judicata and cannot be revised unless a very specific situation which calls for the tribunal to revisit its prior findings is presented\".49 Again, the conclusion contains an unsupported *a contrario* argument. The Tribunal, instead of citing any provision that would confer such *res judicata* effect, refers to \"ample prior authority\"50, quoting the *CMS* Award (that does not use the term), *Waste Management II* (which is not conclusive)51, and *Electrabel* (which is confined to the particular case and no longer supported by two of the Tribunal\u2019s members), omitting any mention of decisions not compatible with such \"authority\". Finally, the *Perenco* Tribunal points to the Majority Reconsideration Decision rendered in the instant case, which \"fits within a well-established view\".52 However, it also observes that the relevant facts and allegations are significantly different in both cases53, thus adding a note of caution that shows that the categorical assertion of a *res judicata* effect attached to any pre-award decision is not sufficient to prohibit reconsideration in all cases.\n\nDecision, para. 42.\n\nDecision, paras. 43-48. The quote is repeated in the Majority\u2019s Renewed Version (para. 31), without further elaboration, except the mention of two other ICSID cases \"to the same or similar effect\", as \"cited by the *Perenco Ecuador* tribunal\", although they do not support the argument.\n\nThe **Perenco** Tribunal notes (para. 45) that the Tribunal seized with the **Waste Management II** case affirmed that a decision on a particular point on jurisdiction or the merits constitutes *res judicata; Waste Management Inc.*  v. *United Mexican States (Waste Management II),* ICSID/ARB(AF)/00/3, Decision on Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceeding, para. 45. This presentation is not correct and no support can be driven for a situation as existing in the **Perenco** matter and in the instant case. As the *Waste Management II Award* of April 30, 2004 explains, the decision on jurisdiction that was addressed by Mexico\u2019s objection was rendered in a *prior* and *different* proceeding, when jurisdiction was denied because of Claimant\u2019s failure to commit with the requirement to pursue domestic remedies before resorting to international arbitration (para. 4). The **Waste Management II** Tribunal concluded that this negative decision did not prevent Claimant from bringing its claim again before an arbitral tribunal (para. 11).\n\nDecision, para. 48.\n\nDecision, paras. 86-88.\n\n78.\n\nThe ****Perenco**** Tribunal omitted to examine whether the applicable procedural rules provide for any kind of finality that would preclude revisiting interim decisions on jurisdiction or on the merits. It stated, when considering Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s Dissent, that it had a different view on Arbitration Rule 3 8(2),54 but it did not take into account that in the instant case, the proceedings have not been closed and that therefore Rule 38(2) does not apply55. One other simplification appears in the ****Perenco**** Tribunal\u2019s reasoning holding that Article 44 of the Convention does not provide for such a power. This does by no means have the *a contrario* effect that such power therefore shall not exist: to the contrary, this provision empowers the Tribunal to decide any procedural matter it deems fit for such purpose, and this may very well include a certain ability to review prior decisions. The ****Perenco**** Tribunal restricted the scope of this provision in this respect by its assertion that no other provision was available to provide for such power (para. 77); in arguing so, it deprived Article 44 of the Convention of its *effet utile* in the matter under scrutiny. Article 44 of the Convention has precisely the purpose to vest the Tribunal with the power to decide matters that are otherwise not dealt with by the Convention and the applicable Rules.56 And no provision of the Convention or the Arbitration Rules prohibits a Tribunal to review its prior (interim or partial) decisions as a matter of principle. The ****Perenco**** Tribunal addressed the question exclusively in terms of permission, not raising the matter in terms of prohibition. It adopted a categorical ruling about the effects of interim and partial decisions under the ICSID system, omitting to consider that this system does not provide for or contemplate such decisions, as this had been noted by the *Tanesco* Tribunal.57 The question submitted through *Perenco \u2019s* Application was answered by a simple *a contrario* assertion without any reliance on a ground providing so in the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules.\n\nDecision, para. 86\n\nThis is a manifest mistake that must be highlighted. It can be explained by the fact that the absence of a declaration for closure of the proceedings is not mentioned in the Majority Decision on Reconsideration. It can be identified when reading the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits.\n\nInterestingly, the *Perenco* Tribunal recognizes that the *Abaclat* Tribunal was \"seeking to design a procedure that would govern the special needs and demands of the case before it\" (para. 79). The Tribunal understands that this seems admissible as \"an example of a tribunal in the early stage of a case\" *(ib.).* However, it does not identify why such filling of a gap was authorized by Article 44 \"in the early stage of a case\" and not at a later stage, at least as long as the proceeding had not been declared closed.\n\n*Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited v. Independent Power Tanzania Limited,* ICSID/ARB/98/8, Final Award of July 12, 2001, para. 32.\n\n79.\n\nFinally, the question may also be raised whether the refusal to deal with Respondent\u2019s request and the lack of available remedies in this respect does not result in a violation of a fundamental right of a party to get access to justice. It is my submission that the ICSID Convention has to be interpreted so far as possible in harmony with other rules of international law of which it forms part. I also submit that a fundamental rule of Law provides for a possibility to submit to court an application for reconsideration or revision of a decision that has been induced by illegal behavior or based on facts nonexistent at the time of the decision and ignored by the aggrieved party and the Tribunal for reasons not due to the negligence of the party later invoking the true facts, further assuming that the submission for reconsideration or revision, if accepted, would cause to modify in significant part the prior decision.58 This is certainly a principle that the Tribunal must have in mind when it takes a decision on Respondent\u2019s Application, be it on the basis of Article 44 of the ICSID Convention or on the basis of the \"rules of international law as may be applicable\", on which Article 42(1) relies. Faced with a *prima facie* serious allegation of a clear and fundamental violation of Justice, no Tribunal or Arbitrator can stand by and affirm that it is left with \"no power\" to deal with the matter.59\n\nAnother way to address the issue is to refer to well-recognized exceptions to the recognition and enforcement of a decision\u2019s effect of *res judicata,* including a situation where evidence has been submitted \"that the previous decision is vitiated by a fundamental flaw, such as being tainted by corruption or fraud, resulting from a procedure inconsistent with fundamental due process principles, or having been rendered by a tribunal lacking jurisdiction\": Brower/Henin, *op.cit.,* p. 69.\n\nSee also Brower/Henin, *op.cit,,* concluding that \"it might not be right to suggest, as the majority in *ConcocoPhillips v. Venezuela* did, that the question of a tribunal\u2019s power to revisit its own findings can be considered in isolation from the context of the very request\" (p. 68/69).\n\n80.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal\u2019s mission should be to reverse the Decision of March 10, 2014 (the \"Majority Reconsideration Decision\") and to proceed with the examination of the Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration of September 8, 2013, together with the Respondent\u2019s Application for Reconsideration dated August 10, 2015, based on the allegation that Claimants did make material misrepresentations to the Tribunal as to Respondent\u2019s willingness to negotiate fair market value, if and to the extent that the underlying facts for such assumption are of such a nature as decisively to affect the Decision by a fundamental error of fact and law, and if evidence is supplied that when the Decision was made these facts were either unknown to or manifestly and erroneously disregarded by the Tribunal and that such ignorance or disregard was not due to negligence on Respondent\u2019s part."}, {"Title": "Note by Arbitrator Kenneth Keith and Arbitrator Yves Fortier", "Type": "Other", "Date": null, "Content": "Note by Arbitrator Kenneth Keith and Arbitrator Yves Fortier\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nWe add this note as a comment on Part III of the dissenting opinion of Arbitrator Andreas Bucher.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Application which is to be decided by the Tribunal is \u201cfor Reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of March 10, 2014 (the Majority Reconsideration Decision...)\u201d. The Respondent stressed that \u201cthe issue for decision at this stage is a narrow one. It is not necessary for this Tribunal now to revisit the merits of the Majority Merits Decision\u201d (see para 13 above for the remainder of that passage). Given the limited scope of the Application before the Tribunal we cannot see that the passage of Arbitrator Bucher\u2019s dissent headed \u201cThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision\u201d is relevant.\n\n3.\n\nWe also need to make it clear that we do not interpret the 2013 Decision in the way Arbitrator Bucher does. Nor indeed do the Parties, as he indeed recognises (paras 17-19 of his opinion). The Tribunal ruled that the Respondent had acted unlawfully by reference to Article 6(c) of the BIT. That requires that the measures be taken against just compensation. The Tribunal said this about that provision:\n\nThe requirements [in Article 6(c)] for prompt payment and for interest recognise, in accordance with the general understanding of such standard provisions, that payment is not required at the precise moment of expropriation. But it is also commonly accepted that the Parties must engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the standard set, in this case, in the BIT, if a payment satisfactory to the investor is not proposed at the outset. (para 362)\n\nHaving reviewed the evidence and the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal concluded that the Respondent had breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the assets on the basis of market value as required by the BIT (para 401). It included that conclusion in its Decision (para 404(d)).  \nWith respect, Arbitrator Bucher errs when he writes in paragraph 11 of his dissenting opinion that the Claimants made no claim in their Request for Relief for a declaration that Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation based on market value.\n\nIn their Request for Relief, the Claimants asked the Tribunal for a declaration \u201cthat Venezuela has breached ...

The decision does not address the grounds the Respondent invokes for reconsidering the part of the Decision which it challenges and the evidence which it sees as supporting those grounds. The power must be shown to exist before it can be exercised\".2\n\nDecision of 10 March 2014 on Respondent's First Request for Reconsideration (\"**Decision of 10 March 2014**\"), para. 9.\n\n9.\n\nIt then set out the arguments of the parties based on the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration rules as well as commentaries, matters of principle and decisions of various international courts and tribunals.\n\n10.\n\nHaving considered those arguments, the Tribunal concluded that it did not have the power to reconsider the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, with Professor Georges Abi-Saab dissenting. It was implicit in the Tribunal's Decision that the Respondent's Request was dismissed.\n\n**C. THE NEW APPLICATION FOR RECONSIDERATION**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nProfessor Georges Abi-Saab resigned on 20 February 2015 with immediate effect. On 10 August 2015 the Tribunal was reconstituted, with Professor Andreas Bucher being appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n12.\n\nOn that same day, 10 August 2015, the Respondent submitted an \"Application for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision of March 10, 2014 (the Majority Reconsideration Decision), which denied Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's [September 3, 2013 Jurisdiction and Merits Decision]\".3 The Respondent recalled that it had, immediately following that Majority Merits Decision, applied for reconsideration, pointing out\n\ncertain obvious factual, legal and logical errors the correction of any one of which would require a change in the majority's conclusions on the issue of good faith negotiations. Of particular relevance to this Application, Respondent pointed out that cables from the U.S. Embassy released after the hearing in this case in 2010, which reported on the briefings made by the chief ConocoPhillips negotiators to the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, left no doubt that the representations made by ConocoPhillips to the Tribunal regarding Respondent's supposed unwillingness to negotiate fair market value had been completely false, and that it was in fact ConocoPhillips which was seeking compensation \u2018on top of the fair market value of the assets.' Since the majority had relied on Claimants' misrepresentations in reaching its conclusion on bad faith negotiation, Respondent assumed that the Tribunal would want to reconsider the Majority Merits Decision to avoid an obvious gross miscarriage of justice. That assumption was based on the premise that every tribunal has the power to correct its own decision while the case is still pending before it and should exercise that power if its decision were indeed based on patently false representations. (footnote omitted)4\n\nRespondents' Application for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision of March 10, 2014 (\"**Respondent's Second Application for Reconsideration**\"), pp 1-2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Application for Reconsideration, pp. 2-3.\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent sets out the conclusion of the Tribunal and quotes four paragraphs from Professor Abi-Saab's dissent.5 It concludes the substance of its submission as follows:\n\nIn making this Application, Respondent stresses that the issue for decision at this stage is a narrow one. It is not necessary for this Tribunal now to revisit the merits of the Majority Merits Decision. What is necessary is for this Tribunal to determine whether, assuming that Claimants did make material misrepresentations to the Tribunal as to Respondent's willingness to negotiate fair market value, the Tribunal did, and still does, have the power to reconsider the Majority Merits Decision. A negative answer to this question would mean that there are no circumstances under which a tribunal can reconsider its own decision in a case still pending before it, irrespective of material misrepresentations made to it and, indeed, presumably irrespective of any other egregious conduct. That is a principle that cannot be sustained under any legal system.6\n\nIt requested a hearing on the application.\n\nSee Prof. Abi-Saab \u2019s Dissenting Opinion to the Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Re quest for Reconsideration, paras 64-67.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Application for Reconsideration, p. 6.\n\n14.\n\nOn 12 August 2015, the Claimants responded in these terms:\n\nThe application is frivolous and dilatory. Venezuela has not even attempted to articulate a legal basis for the admissibility of a request to reconsider a reconsideration decision - because there is none. The Tribunal\u2019s 10 March Decision considered and rejected the same arguments that Venezuela now raises. It has *res judicata* effect and may not be revisited or reviewed in any way prior to the rendering of the final Award.7\n\nThe Claimants requested that the Tribunal dismiss the Respondent's application forthwith and promptly reschedule the final hearing.\n\nClaimants' letter of 12 August 2015, p. 1.\n\n15.\n\nLater that same day, the Respondent commented by recalling its earlier letter:\n\n...no system of justice can tolerate a rule that a tribunal cannot correct its own decision, no matter how egregious the circumstances, in a case still pending before it. Surely one cannot argue that an interim decision proven to be based upon corruption, intimidation or coercion cannot be reconsidered. The same is true for a decision shown to be based upon material misrepresentations.8\n\nIn support of its contention that *res judicata* did not apply here - there is no final award and the same proceeding continues - it quoted from the *Sabotage Cases:*\n\nThe petition, in short, avers the Commission has been misled by fraud and collusion on the part of witnesses and suppression of evidence on the part of some of them. The Commission is not *functus officio*. It still sits as a court. To it in that capacity are brought charges that it has been defrauded and misled by perjury, collusion, and suppression. No tribunal worthy of its name or of any respect may allow its decision to stand if such allegations are well-founded. Every tribunal has inherent power to reopen and to revise a decision induced by fraud. If it may correct its own errors and mistakes, *a fortiori* it may, while it still has jurisdiction of a cause, correct errors into which it has been led by fraud and collusion.9\n\nRespondent's letter of 12 August 2015, para. 1.\n\n*VIII United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards* 160 (2006), pp. 189-190.\n\n16.\n\nOn 13 August 2015 the Claimants stated that their letter of the previous day provided a complete answer to the Respondent's points in its later letter. They \"consider that further debate is neither necessary nor appropriate\".10\n\nClaimants' letter of 13 August 2015, p. 1.\n\n17.\n\nOn 15 August 2015, the parties were advised that the Tribunal \"is currently considering Respondent's application, including its request for a hearing, and will revert to the parties in due course. The Tribunal considers that no further submissions are needed at this point.\"11\n\nICSID's letter of 15 August 2015, p. 2.\n\n18.\n\nOn 9 November 2015, the Respondent submitted a proposal to disqualify L. Yves Fortier QC as arbitrator. In terms of Rule 9(6) of the Arbitration Rules, the proceeding was suspended until 15 December 2015 when the proposal was dismissed. The Tribunal then gave the Respondent the opportunity to comment on a letter of 8 December 2015 submitted by the Senior Vice President Legal, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of ConocoPhillips which the Respondent did on 8 January 2015. The Tribunal also gave the parties the opportunity to comment by 22 January 2016 on an article discussing the March 2014 Decision brought to its attention by Counsel for the Respondent.12 Each party provided that comment.\n\nCharles N. Brower and Paula F.Henin, \"Chapter 5: *Res judicata* \" in Meg N. Kinnear, Geraldine R. Fischer, et al. (eds), *Building International Investment Law: The First 50 Years of ICSID*, (Kluwer Law International; Kluwer Law International 2015) (the \" **Article on Res Judicata** \") pp. 55 - 69.\n\n19.\n\nIn the light of that additional material, subsequent decisions and the earlier arguments submitted to it, the Tribunal has given further consideration to the powers it may possess in respect of the application now before it.\n\n**D. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting that the parties in their exchanges in August did not elaborate to any great extent on the arguments they had made in relation to the earlier application for reconsideration. It accordingly returns to those arguments as well as to the material and arguments made and becoming available subsequently.\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal undertakes this inquiry without prejudice to the contention, raised by the Claimants, that the Decision of 10 March 2014 is itself *res judicata* and cannot be reexamined.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent in 2013 in support of its submission that the Tribunal had power to reconsider the 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits invoked Articles 43 and 44 of the Convention, together with the inherent power of the Tribunal to make decisions regarding the conduct of proceedings going beyond the specific rules under which it is constituted, and Rule 38(2) of the Arbitration Rules. It also referred to commentaries, matters of principle and decisions of various international courts and tribunals. It placed major emphasis on Article 44 and particularly on its second sentence:\n\n**Article 44**\n\nAny arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\n\n23.\n\nThe power to which the second sentence refers is a power to decide on a question of procedure not covered by the Convention, the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties. According to a leading commentator on the ICSID Convention, the power is declaratory of the inherent power of any tribunal to resolve procedural questions in the event of *lacunae.*13 The commentary continues in these terms: \"In exercising this power, the Tribunal may not go beyond the framework of the Convention, the Arbitration Rules and the parties' procedural agreements but must primarily attempt to close any apparent gaps through the established methods of interpretation...\".14 The procedural character of the power appears not only in the very terms of Article 44 but also in the use that has been made of that power; that commentary instances decisions about time limits, production of documents, suspension when other arbitral processes are pending, publicity to be given to proceedings and the grant of *amicus curiae* status.15 These are matters related to \"the conduct of the proceedings\", to use the wording of Rule 19 of the Arbitration Rules. Does the power stated in Article 44 contain within it a power to reconsider rulings, in effect by a rehearing, which it has made on jurisdiction and on aspects of the merits? Does such a power concern \"a question of procedure\" or \"the conduct of the proceedings\"? It appears to the Tribunal to be a very different power. It is a power of a substantive kind. The ordinary meaning of Article 44 read by itself does not appear to the Tribunal to include the power which the Respondent seeks.\n\nC. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, Second Edition (2009), p. 688.\n\nIbid\n\nIbid, pp. 689-707.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls that throughout the preparation of the text of the Convention those responsible for the drafting emphasized that the Arbitration Rules to be made by the Administrative Council under Article 6(1)(c) of the Convention and referred to in Article 44 would not deal with matters of substance.16 They would not in general be concerned with matters of great importance.17 That conforms with the role and character of rules of procedure adopted by bodies other than the court or tribunal and to be applied by them. That being so, it would be remarkable were the residual power of the tribunal in respect of matters of procedure or the conduct of the proceeding - a power at the fourth level, below the Convention, the Arbitration Rules and rules agreed by the parties - to include the power which the Respondent invokes here.\n\n*History of the ICSID Convention*, vol II, pp. 111, 214, 249, 331, 357 and 571-2.\n\nIbid, p. 79.\n\n25.\n\nThe provision is of course to be read in context and by reference to purpose as many court and tribunal decisions, often referring to Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, have long made clear. That process of interpretation may be related in this case to \"the framework\" provided by the Convention to recall the words of a leading commentator18 or in the words of another ICSID tribunal rejecting a motion for reconsideration, \"the clear structure of the Convention and the Arbitration Rules\"19 The Tribunal recalls that the International Court of Justice in an early ruling interpreting a treaty, in that case the Charter of the United Nations, considered that \" the structure of the Charter\" fully confirmed the conclusions to which the Court was led by the text of the provision before it.20\n\nSee para 23 above.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Ecuador's Reconsideration Motion, 10 April 2015 (the \" **Perenco Ecuador Decision** \"), para 80.\n\n*Competence of the General Assembly regarding admission to the United Nations*, 1950 ICJ Reps 4, 8-9.\n\n26.\n\nThe Convention contains a carefully constructed set of provisions for the interpretation, revision and annulment of the Award - Articles 50-52, constituting Section 5 of Chapter IV - Arbitration. Those provisions are followed by Article 53, the first provision of Section 6, headed Recognition and Enforcement of the Award:\n\n**Article 53**\n\n(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Article 50, 51 or 52.\n\nIt is convenient to mention at this stage Article 48(3) of the Convention:\n\n**Article 48**\n\n(3) The award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\n\nIn the 2014 Decision, the Tribunal said that the decisions included in the 2013 Decision in accordance with practice are to be incorporated in the Award.21 This is required, as Article 48(3) recognizes, since the Award given at the end of the process must deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal. The required reasons are also to be incorporated, at least by reference.22 The Tribunal notes that in the process of the drafting of what became Article 48(3) the text was amended to emphasise that the tribunal in its award was to deal with every issue presented.23\n\nDecision of 10 March 2014, para. 21.\n\nSee also Schreuer, *op. cit*, pp. 538 and 829-30 - to the extent that preliminary decisions are decisive for the outcome they must be reflected in the award.\n\n*History of the ICSID Convention*, vol II, pp 610, 632-633 and 849.\n\n27.\n\nIn addition to the provisions regulating interpretation, revision and annulment is article 49(2) which enables a party within 45 days to request the Tribunal to decide any question which it omitted to decide and to rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. The Tribunal notes the limits of all those powers - to correct error, to interpret, to revise by reference to new facts, to annul on limited grounds. This last power, in contrast to the other three, is not to be exercised by the tribunal itself but by a separately constituted *ad hoc* committee of three persons. Those specifically prescribed powers are reflected in the final phrase of the first sentence of Article 53(1): the award, which, as the Tribunal has just said, is to incorporate the earlier decisions, is binding and not subject to appeal or any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Nowhere is there any suggestion that the Tribunal might be able, before completing the award which may then be subject to that range of processes explicitly provided for in careful detail, to reexamine parts of its decision in effect by way of a rehearing or an appeal.\n\n28.\n\nIt is convenient to consider at this point the arguments based on the inherent powers or jurisdiction of the Tribunal. As indicated, Article 44 may be seen as reflecting those powers, while making them express. The Tribunal has already noted practical instances of the exercise of such powers which fall within the scope of Article 44 in any event.24 They are of a quite different order from the broad power of substantive reconsideration which the Respondent invokes in this case. It is true that in three cases the International Court of Justice has spoken in general terms about its duty to safeguard its judicial function and to maintain its judicial character.25 Those cases, however, are not directly on point since they were decided on the basis that there was no live dispute in issue before the Court which accordingly had nothing before it to decide in terms of its function of deciding disputes; in one case circumstances had arisen which rendered any adjudication devoid of purpose26 and in the other two the disputes between the parties no longer existed.27 Further, the judgments of the Court were final and binding and, in the circumstances of each case, the post judgment processes of interpretation and revision appear not to have been available.\n\nSee para. 23 above.\n\n*Case concerning the Northern Cameroons (Cameroon v United Kingdom) Preliminary Objections, Judgment of 2 December 1963* ; ICJ Reports 1963, pp. 15, 29, 31, 38; *Nuclear Tests (Australia v France), Judgment*, 1974 ICJ Reports, pp. 253, 259 and *Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v France) Judgment*, 1974 ICJ Reports, pp. 457, 463.\n\n1963 ICJ Reports, pp. 33-34\n\n1974 ICJ Reports, pp. 270-272 and 475-477.\n\n29.\n\nThe agreement and rules establishing and regulating the work of the Commission and its Umpire who decided the Sabotage cases (which, it will be recalled, the Respondent again cited in its present application)28 contain nothing comparable to Articles 49-52 of the ICSID Convention.29 Moreover, as the Umpire recorded, the Commission had in its practice repeatedly reopened and corrected decisions to accord with the facts and the applicable legal rules.30\n\nSee para 15 above.\n\n*VII United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards*, p. 13 and *VIII United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards*, pp. 469-477.\n\n*VII United Nations Reports of International Arbitral Awards,* p. 188.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal returns to the context of the Convention or its framework or structure. Even if in principle the inherent powers or jurisdiction of this tribunal were capable of extending to a power such as that invoked here, in the words of a decision of another ICSID tribunal cited earlier, \"the clear structure of the Convention and the Arbitration Rules cannot be overridden by a general appeal to inherent powers\".31\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Decision*, para 80.\n\n31.\n\nIn its 2014 Decision, the Tribunal in support of its proposition that the 2013 Decision had the character of *res judicata* quoted from an earlier decision. It now takes the opportunity to quote the relevant passage accurately and in full; in the *Electrabel S.A.* v *Republic of Hungary* Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, the tribunal noted:\n\nThis Decision is made in regard only to the first phase of these arbitration proceedings, relating to extant issues of jurisdiction and liability; and it is not made in regard to any issue of *quantum* (including interest). Although necessarily described as a \u2018Decision' and not an \u2018Award' under the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules, the several decisions and reasons contained in this Decision are intended by the Tribunal to be final and not to be revised by the Parties or the Tribunal in any later phase of these arbitration proceedings.32\n\nTo the same or similar effect are two other ICSID cases cited by the *Perenco Ecuador* tribunal along with the relevant passage of the Tribunal's 2014 Decision in support of its proposition that\n\nThere is ample prior authority in support of the view [that] once the tribunal decides with finality any of the factual or legal questions put to it by the parties, as was the case in the Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and Liability, such a decision becomes *res judicata* [citing *CMS Gas Transmission* v *Argentine Republic* ICSID ARB 01/8, May 12 2005, para 126 and *Waste Management Inc* v *United Mexican States (Waste Management II)* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/3, para 45.]33\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, para 10.1. See also Award, 25 November 2015, para 2.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador* Decision, para. 43.\n\n32.\n\nIt is convenient to mention at this stage the recent award in *Quiborax SA and Non Metallic Minerals SA v Plurinational State of Bolivia*.34 The tribunal in that case had made a Decision on jurisdiction in 2012, a Decision which, it said, \"forms an integral part of this Award\".35 At the merits stage the Respondent raised a new objection to jurisdiction. The tribunal said that\n\nOnly the allegation of an illegality that was unknown to [the Respondent] during the jurisdictional phase may justify reopening the matter at the merit stage (emphasis added).36\n\n*Quiborax SA and Non Metallic Minerals SA v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Award, 16 September 2015.\n\nIbid, para. 51.\n\nIbid, para. 130.\n\n33.\n\nThe tribunal then stated that the Respondent had all the necessary elements at the jurisdictional phase to advance the arguments in issue but had not done so. \"As such, the objection could be rejected outright.\"37 But due to the gravity of the accusation the tribunal considered it and the related evidence and found that it was inconclusive. Accordingly it dismissed that argument.38 That ruling does not in any way question the binding character of the earlier rulings or their *res judicata* effect. Later in its award the tribunal turns to other objections to jurisdiction, objections which the Respondent had not made at the jurisdictional phase. The tribunal dealt with these objections in this way:\n\nThe jurisdictional phase concluded with the Decision on Jurisdiction, in which the Tribunal established that it had jurisdiction over the claims of Quiborax and NMM. The Tribunal finds that there is no reason that can justify reopening the jurisdictional issues at this stage, *assuming this were at all possible*. It therefore denies the Respondent's new jurisdictional objections (emphasis added).39\n\nAgain, the tribunal gives no support at all to the proposition that there may be limits to the binding force of earlier jurisdictional decisions or their *res judicata* effect.\n\nIbid, para. 132.\n\nIbid, paras 132-134.\n\nIbid, paras 538-541.\n\n34.\n\nIn its comment of 22 January 2016 and in support of its argument that *res judicata* does not override \"the search for truth and substantive justice\", the Respondent quotes a \"key passage\" from the Article to which it had referred the Tribunal.40 That passage begins as follows:\n\n[W]hen tribunals have attributed *res judicata* effect to a decision they previously issued in the same proceedings, they have also considered themselves to possess what Professor Abi-Saab calls a \"specific power\" to revisit such decision under certain limited and exigent circumstances, such as where new material evidence emerges calling into question the correctness of their prior findings. As such, it may not be right to suggest, as the majority in ConocoPhillips v Venezuela did, that the question of a tribunal's power to revisit its own findings can be considered in isolation from the context of that very request (\u2026)41\n\nThe Tribunal notes however that the cases to which the authors refer42 do not support that proposition; in each case, even if the tribunals did consider the asserted grounds, they do not identify any power to reconsider the issues and all applications failed.\n\nSee para. 18 above.\n\nArticle on Res Judicata, pp. 68-69.\n\nSee Article on Res Judicata, pp. 68-69, ftns 73 and 76. The Article cites *Tokios Tokel\u00e8s v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Award, 26 July 2007, paras 5 and 98; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 12 May 2005, para. 126; *Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008, paras. 121-130; and *Saipem S.p.A. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7, Award, 30 June 2009, para. 94.\n\n35.\n\nThe *Perenco Ecuador* tribunal, this Tribunal notes, said that it had little difficulty in expressing its general agreement with the approach taken by the majority in the 2014 Decision.43 It is true that it did consider the grounds that had been invoked in support of the application for reconsideration in its case but as it made clear at the end of its decision rejecting the application it concluded that it had no power to engage in the exercise requested of it, namely to issue a decision amending its decision on remaining issues of jurisdiction and liability. Its examination of the grounds was \"purely for illustrative purposes and without prejudice to its decision that it does not have the power to reopen and reconsider its findings in the manner for which Ecuador has contended\".44\n\n*Perenco Ecuador* Decision, para. 81\n\n*Perenco Ecuador* Decision, para. 97.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent in support of its earlier application also claimed that the \"interim\" or \"preliminary\" character of the 2013 Decision enabled reconsideration. It has not elaborated on that contention and accordingly the Tribunal does no more than recall its earlier rejection of that argument.45 The Tribunal also does not see the essentially procedural character of Article 43 of the Convention and Rule 38(2) of the Arbitration Rules as supporting the existence of the power of substantive decisions which the Respondent invokes. Moreover, those provisions would not have been applicable in their own terms; the Tribunal has no reason to exercise the power to call evidence provided in Article 43(a), and in terms of Rule 38(2), the proceedings had not been declared closed. On the role of Rule 38(2) the Tribunal also expresses its general agreement with what the *Perenco Ecuador* tribunal says about that provision.46 The Tribunal notes that the Respondent did not seek support for its power of reconsideration from Rule 19.\n\nSee Decision of 10 March 2014, para. 20.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador* Decision, paras 67-73.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal has approached this matter, as have the parties, in terms of seeking the existence and source of the power the Respondent would have it exercise.47 It is not a matter of finding a rule prohibiting the existence or exercise of such a power. That power has to be found to exist.\n\nSee para. 7 above.\n\n**E. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n38.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal, by a majority, dismisses the application made by the Respondent for the reconsideration of its Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration of 10 March 2014, with Professor Andreas Bucher dissenting.\n\n**Note by Arbitrator Kenneth Keith and Arbitrator Yves Fortier**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nWe add this note as a comment on Part III of the dissenting opinion of Arbitrator Andreas Bucher.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent's Application which is to be decided by the Tribunal is \"for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision of March 10, 2014 (the Majority Reconsideration Decision...)\". The Respondent stressed that \"the issue for decision at this stage is a narrow one. It is not necessary for this Tribunal now to revisit the merits of the Majority Merits Decision\" (see para 13 above for the remainder of that passage). Given the limited scope of the Application before the Tribunal we cannot see that the passage of Arbitrator Bucher's dissent headed \"The Tribunal's Decision\" is relevant.\n\n3.\n\nWe also need to make it clear that we do not interpret the 2013 Decision in the way Arbitrator Bucher does. Nor indeed do the Parties, as he indeed recognises (paras 17-19 of his opinion). The Tribunal ruled that the Respondent had acted unlawfully by reference to Article 6(c) of the BIT. That requires that the measures be taken against just compensation. The Tribunal said this about that provision:\n\nThe requirements [in Article 6(c)] for prompt payment and for interest recognise, in accordance with the general understanding of such standard provisions, that payment is not required at the precise moment of expropriation. But it is also commonly accepted that the Parties must engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the standard set, in this case, in the BIT, if a payment satisfactory to the investor is not proposed at the outset. (para 362)\n\nHaving reviewed the evidence and the Parties' submissions, the Tribunal concluded that the Respondent had breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the assets on the basis of market value as required by the BIT (para 401). It included that conclusion in its Decision (para 404(d)).\n\nWith respect, Arbitrator Bucher errs when he writes in paragraph 11 of his dissenting opinion that the Claimants made no claim in their Request for Relief for a declaration that\n\nRespondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation based on market value. In their Request for Relief, the Claimants asked the Tribunal for a declaration \"that Venezuela has breached... Article 6 of the Treaty by unlawfully [emphasis added] expropriating...\" their investments in Venezuela. This is precisely what the majority found in paragraph 404(d) of the Decision."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Arbitrator L.

RESPONDENT'S FIFTH PROPOSAL TO DISQUALIFY L.

Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15), a case chaired by Mr. Fortier.2 The relevant passage reads as follows:\n\nFollowing a proposal by the Tribunals during the Joint First Session that Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault serve as assistant to the Tribunals in these two proceedings, and the Parties\u2019 subsequent agreement thereto, Ms. Th\u00e9riault was appointed to serve as Assistant to the two Tribunals. In February 2012, with the agreement of the Parties, Ms. Alison FitzGerald replaced Ms. Th\u00e9riault to serve as Assistant to the two Tribunals.3\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief on Items 3-6 of the Agenda for the February 24, 2016 Hearing, \u00b6\u00b6 45-47.\n\n*Bernhard von Pezold and Others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15), Award, July 28, 2015, \u00b6 21.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that this passage appeared to be irreconcilable with Mr. Fortier\u2019s statement of April 16, 2015 in this case (the \"**April 16 Statement**\"), and called on Mr. Fortier for explanations. The April 16 Statement reads as follows:\n\nThe only other Norton Rose lawyer who has continued to serve, after 31 December 2011, as Assistant to an ICSID arbitral tribunal which I chair and who continues to do so today is Ms. Alison Fitzgerald who works in the Ottawa office of Norton Rose. These are the two Zimbabwe\u2019s cases referred to in footnote 27 of the Respondent\u2019s submission. These two related large cases have been proceeding in parallel since the tribunals were constituted. Ms. Fitzgerald was appointed as Assistant to the Tribunals prior to 31 December 2011 when she was a very junior lawyer with Oqilvy Renault. After I resigned from Norton Rose, it also made good practical and financial sense to have her continue as Assistant to these ICSID tribunals.\n\n7.\n\nOn February 25, 2016, Mr. Fortier replied to the Respondent, as follows:\n\nMesdames, Gentlemen,\n\nI refer to the Respondent\u2019s Reply Brief of 19 February 2016 and paras. 45, 46 and 47 thereof.\n\nWhat follows is the long form version of all pertinent incidents which led to the confirmation in February 2012 of Ms. Alison Fitzgerald as assistant to the two ICSID Zimbabwean tribunals which I chaired:\n\n1. Upon my recommendation to my co-arbitrators, Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault of the Ottawa office of Ogilvy Renault was appointed, with the consent of the parties, as assistant to the two tribunals when they were constituted.\n\n2. Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault fulfilled her duties as assistant to these tribunals until mid-December 2011 when she informed me that she had decided to leave active practice at the end of the month and join the Supreme Court of Canada as a research assistant.\n\n3. I thus recommended to my co-arbitrators that Ms. Th\u00e9riault be replaced by her colleague, Ms. Alison Fitzgerald, also a young lawyer at the Ottawa office of Ogilvy Renault with whom I had worked previously.\n\n4. My co-arbitrators readily endorsed my recommendation before the end of December 2011.\n\n5. As you will recall, I resigned as a partner at Ogilvy Renault effective 31 December 2011 and at that time was making arrangements to leave my office and pursue my career as an independent arbitrator. There were thus a number of matters, such as the formalization of Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s appointment as a successor to Ms. Th\u00e9riault, which I did not consider pressing. Accordingly, those matters went on a list of \"things to do\" in early 2012.\n\n6. At the end of an extended Christmas vacation, on 2 February 2012, through the secretary of the tribunals, I informed the parties of Ms. Th\u00e9riault\u2019s departure from active practice in December and proposed, on behalf of the tribunals, that her former colleague at Ogilvy Renault (at that time Norton Rose OR), Ms. Alison Fitzgerald, be appointed in her place and stead subject to the same terms and conditions. All parties agreed and I note that the formalization of Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s appointment took place in February 2012.\n\nI sincerely hope that these explanations are helpful.\n\n8.\n\nOn February 26, 2016, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier (the \"**Proposal**\" or \"**Respondent\u2019s Submission of February 26, 2016**\").\n\n9.\n\nOn the same date, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken with respect to the Proposal.\n\n10.\n\nThe following day, the President of the Tribunal, having consulted with Professor Bucher, set a timetable for the parties\u2019 submissions and for Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants filed a submission on March 2, 2016 (\"**Claimants\u2019 Reply of March 2, 2016**\") and Mr. Fortier furnished his explanations on March 4, 2016 (\"**Mr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of March 4, 2016**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn March 8, 2016, both parties submitted additional observations on the Proposal (\"**Respondent\u2019s Additional Observations**\" and \"**Claimants\u2019 Additional Observations**\", respectively).\n\n**B. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS AND MR. FORTIER'S EXPLANATIONS**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. RESPONDENT'S PROPOSAL OF FEBRUARY 26, 2016**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent makes its Proposal pursuant to Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention. According to the Respondent, the \"entire background\" of its Proposal \"has already been fully briefed, as have the applicable legal principles\".4\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission of February 26, 2016, p. 2.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent recalls its continued concern about Fortier\u2019s relationship with Norton Rose attorneys. It refers, in particular, to Mr. Fortier\u2019s April 16 Statement, which he reaffirmed on June 1, 2015. It contends that the \"plain meaning\" of such statement was that \"Ms. FitzGerald was not only appointed before Mr. Fortier left Norton Rose on December 31, 2011, but also that she must have been appointed before June 1, 2011, as Ogilvy Renault merged into Norton Rose on that date.\"5\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 3.\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent claims that \"[i]t is clear that Ms. FitzGerald was not actually appointed as assistant to the Zimbabwe tribunals until after Mr. Fortier left Norton Rose, even if he had discussed it with his co-arbitrators a few days before he left that firm, and of course it is clear that Ms. FitzGerald was not appointed when she was at Ogilvy Renault, a firm that merged out of existence on June 1, 2011.\"6 Respondent notes that \"Ms. FitzGerald\u2019s appointment came not only after Mr. Fortier had left Norton Rose, but also during the pendency of the first proposal to disqualify him in this case.\"7\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 7.\n\n*Id.*\n\n16.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, \"it is apparent that there was no 'practical' or 'financial' reason whatsoever for Ms. FitzGerald or any other Norton Rose attorney to be appointed as assistant in the Zimbabwe cases.\"8\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 8.\n\n17.\n\nFinally, Respondent asserts that \"this proposal is based on the fact that the disclosure made and reaffirmed in 2015 in response to two direct inquiries was materially incorrect.\"9\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 8.\n\n**2. CLAIMANTS' REPLY OF MARCH 2, 2016**\n----------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nIn their reply of March 2, 2016, the Claimants oppose the Respondent\u2019s Proposal.\n\n19.\n\nThey reject the Respondent\u2019s invocation of the \"entire background\", arguing that Respondent\u2019s allegations in support of previous proposals have already been rejected and cannot be revisited in this proceeding.\n\n20.\n\nThey contend that Respondent has failed to articulate, much less satisfy, the legal standard for disqualification under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. An \"alleged date mistake\" in Mr. Fortier\u2019s disclosures could not possible show a manifest lack of \"the ability to act impartially and independently\".10\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of March 2, 2016, p. 2.\n\n21.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations are straightforward. Ms. Fitzgerald was appointed prior to December 31, 2011, but she did not \"replace\" Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault as assistant until February 2012, when her appointment was formalized. It is clear, they say, that when making these statements \"Mr. Fortier was plainly using the term 'Ogilvy Renault' as shorthand when referring to legacy Ogilvy Renault attorneys.\"11 That is why Mr. Fortier referred to his own resignation as having been from \"Ogilvy Renault\".12\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants conclude requesting that the Tribunal promptly rejects the proposal and order the Respondent to bear the Claimants\u2019 costs in addressing this proposal.\n\n**3. L. YVES FORTIER'S EXPLANATIONS OF MARCH 4, 2016**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nMr. Fortier furnished his explanations on March 4, 2016, as follows:\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nIn accordance with the schedule which you have fixed, I now provide my explanations to the Respondent\u2019s new proposal of 26 February 2016 to disqualify me.\n\n1. I have seen paragraph 45, 46 and 47 of the Respondent\u2019s Reply Brief of 19 February 2016.\n\n2. As then requested by the Respondent, I submitted detailed explanations to the Respondent on 25 February 2016. I would be grateful if those explanations were incorporated to the present submission.\n\n3. I have also seen the Claimants\u2019 submission of 2 March 2016.\n\n4. In its proposal of 26 February 2016, the Respondent alleges that the disclosures which I made (and reaffirmed) on 16 April 2015 with respect to the appointment of Ms Alison Fitzgerald as assistant to the two Zimbabwe ICSID tribunals which I chaired were incorrect.\n\n5. For the sake of clarity, I reconfirm the following:\n\n(i) Ogilvy Renault changed its name to Norton Rose OR LLP on 1 June 2011. It was not \"merged out of existence on June 1, 2011\". (See para. 7 of Respondent\u2019s letter of 26 February 2016).\n\n(ii) I severed all of my professional ties with Norton Rose OR LLP as of 31 December 2011.\n\n(iii) Macleod Dixon joined Norton Rose OR LLP on 1 January 2012 when Norton Rose OR LLP changed its name to Norton Rose Canada LLP.\n\n6. It would have been more accurate for me to add in my explanations of 16 April 2015, after \"Ogilvy Renault\" \"whose name had been changed to Norton Rose OR LLP on 1 June 2011\".\n\n7. I note that in para. 5 of my explanations of 25 February 2016, I wrote that \"[...] I resigned as a partner at Ogilvy Renault effective 31 December 2011\". Again, it would have been more accurate for me to write that \"I resigned as a partner at Ogilvy Renault which had changed its name to Norton Rose OR LLP on 1 June 2011, effective 31 December 2011 [\u2026]\".\n\n8. When I was appointed to this Tribunal, I was independent and impartial. I have always been and will remain independent and impartial until the end of the present proceedings.\n\n9. I reiterate my profound conviction that I am today, always have been and will remain able to exercise independent judgment in the present arbitration.\n\n10. I note that the Respondent calls upon me to resign voluntarily (para. 10). In view of the facts which are before you, I see no reason to voluntarily withdraw as arbitrator.\n\n**4. RESPONDENT'S ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS OF MARCH 8, 2016**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn its Additional Observations, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 comments on the relevance of the \"entire background\" for the adjudication of this Proposal. It argues, by reference to commentaries, that it is \"well established that the factual background of the earlier challenges is relevant in assessing the particular inaccurate disclosures on which this proposal is based.\"13 Here, it says, the \"Respondent has presented new facts which should leave no lingering question that there has been a 'pattern' of non-disclosure, or simply inaccurate disclosure, raising doubts as to Mr. Fortier\u2019s impartiality in this case\".14\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Observations, \u00b6 2.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 3.\n\n25.\n\nEven without the factual background of this case, the Respondent continues, Mr. Fortier\u2019s statement of April 16, 2015, reaffirmed on June 1, 2015, was materially inaccurate because it created an impression of \"lesser ties to Norton Rose than actually existed\", a point of paramount importance and with respect to which the Respondent has made repeated requests for disclosure.15\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 4.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent then addresses the legal standard for disqualification. It refers to the recent decision in *EDF v. Argentina*,16 which, in the Respondent\u2019s view, stresses the \"necessity of considering all of the facts relevant to the issue of impartiality\"17 and to assess such facts \"with reference to the particular case at hand\".18\n\nEDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2016.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Observations, at \u00b6 5.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 6.\n\n27.\n\nIn relation to the Claimants\u2019 opposition to the Proposal, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 portrayal of the facts as an \"alleged date mistake\" as well as their contention that Mr. Fortier had used the term Ogilvy Renault as a shorthand to refer to Norton Rose.\n\n28.\n\nTurning to Mr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of March 4, 2016, the Respondent contends that \"Ogilvy Renault did not just undergo a name change on June 1, 2011; it ceased to be a stand-alone, independent firm, and brought itself under the Norton Rose umbrella.\"19 That is how the legal community reported this transaction and that is, too, how Mr. Fortier referred to it until recently.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 10.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that \"there were no 'practical' or 'financial' reasons for appointing Ms. FitzGerald rather than another person unrelated to Norton Rose.\"20 Nor have the Claimants or Mr. Fortier attempted to explain this.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 13.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent concludes by summarizing its allegations as follows:\n\nThe record shows that the answers to Respondent\u2019s inquiries have always been dribbled out and have been incomplete, misleading and/or inaccurate. Even with respect to Ms. FitzGerald, Mr. Fortier made no disclosure, despite repeated requests by Respondent for disclosure of all relationships with Norton Rose, until Respondent itself discovered that Ms. FitzGerald had acted as Assistant in the Zimbabwe cases. Then, in response to the direct question concerning Ms. FitzGerald, Mr. Fortier informed Respondent that Ms. FitzGerald was appointed when she was a \"very junior lawyer with Ogilvy Renault\" and that it made \"good practical and financial sense to have her continue\" in that capacity, even though she was not appointed when she was a very junior lawyer at Ogilvy Renault, she was not continuing anything after December 31, 2011 as she was not even appointed until February of 2012, and there in fact were no \"practical\" or \"financial\" reasons whatsoever for appointing her rather than a non-Norton Rose attorney. (footnote omitted).21\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 16.\n\n31.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent state that \"a reasonable third party with knowledge of all the facts would consider that there are reasonable grounds for doubting whether Mr. Fortier has the requisite impartiality in this case.\"22\n\n*Id.*, p. 10.\n\n**5. CLAIMANTS' ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS OF MARCH 8, 2016**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants, in their Additional Observations, state that Mr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of March 4, 2016 confirm that the Respondent\u2019s Proposal is \"patently baseless\", requiring thus \"no further comment\" from them.23\n\nClaimants\u2019 Additional Comments, p. 1.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent states that the legal standard for disqualification is \"well established\".24 The Two Members recall as well the interpretation of Article 14 read with Article 57 given in their Decision of December 15, 2015.25 The standard is whether a reasonable third person, with knowledge of all the facts, would conclude, on an objective basis, that the arbitrator is manifestly lacking in the ability to act impartially.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Observations, \u00b6 5, referring to the *EDF* case. See also \u00b6 26 above.\n\nSee Decision on the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6 35.\n\n34.\n\nThe \"new facts\" on which the Respondent relies concern the appointment of Ms. Alison Fitzgerald as assistant to two tribunals chaired by Mr. Fortier. It highlights the fact that in its view Mr. Fortier had twice made statements which in the light of the most recently available information were \"inaccurate and each of the inaccuracies tended to create the impression of lesser ties to Norton Rose than actually existed and to support the notion that Mr. Fortier had severed all ties with Norton Rose upon his resignation from that firm, which clearly was not the case\".26 The Two Members recall that in his letter of April 16, 2015 (confirmed in his letter of June 1, 2015), Mr. Fortier stated that Ms. Fitzgerald \"continued to serve, after 31 December 2011, as Assistant to an ICSID arbitral tribunal which I chair and continues to do so today.... [She] was appointed as Assistant to the Tribunal prior to 31 December 2011... [She] has billed ICSID directly for [that] work\". Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations make it clear that Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s appointment was not concluded in a formal sense by the end of December 2011.27 The formal appointment was in February 2012 after the parties had agreed. The Two Members do not see that difference as significant. The substantive decision was made by the three arbitrators in December 2011.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Observations, \u00b6 4.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 23 above.\n\n35.\n\nMore significantly, the Two Members cannot see that the facts relating to that appointment provide any support at all for the proposition that that limited tie with Norton Rose would lead a reasonable third person with knowledge of those facts to the conclusion that Mr. Fortier is manifestly lacking in the ability to act impartially between the parties in the present arbitration.\n\n36.\n\nInsofar as the Respondent invokes in support of its new Proposal the \"entire background of this matter\"28 and the \"pattern of circumstances\",29 it does not cite new facts requiring the Two Members to reconsider facts considered in the earlier requests for disqualification. They recall paras 37 to 38 of their Decision issued on December 15, 2015.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission of February 26, 2016, p. 2.\n\nAn expression used by the authors quoted in the Respondent\u2019s Additional Observations, \u00b6 2.\n\n**D. COSTS**\n------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Two Members see no reason to depart from the standard practice of determining costs issues at the end of the proceeding.\n\n**E. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n38.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Two Members:\n\n(1) decide to dismiss the Proposal made by the Respondent to disqualify Mr. Yves Fortier as Arbitrator, and\n\n(2) decide to defer the application made by the Claimants for an order for costs to a later stage in the proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L. Yves Fortier, Q.C., Arbitrator", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2016-07-26T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L. Yves Fortier, Q.C., Arbitrator\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Decision issued on March 15, 2016, on the Respondent's fifth proposal for disqualification of Mr. Yves L. Fortier of February 26, 2016, summarizes, by reference to previous decisions, the earlier phases of the proceeding up to March 2016 (the \"**Decision on the Fifth Proposal for Disqualification**\").1 This proposal was rejected for the reasons set out in that decision.\n\nSee Decision on the Fifth Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 1-12.\n\n2.\n\nOn April 22, 2016, the Tribunal was reconstituted, with Mr. Eduardo Zuleta being appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council, following Judge Kenneth Keith's resignation on March 21, 2016.\n\n3.\n\nOn May 6, 2016, the reconstituted Tribunal decided, *inter alia*, to divide the hearing on *quantum* into two phases, the first of which was scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C. on August 15 through 19, 2016. The second phase was scheduled for February 21 through February 25, 2017, also in Washington, D.C.\n\n4.\n\nOn July 22, 2016, Mr. Fortier asked the Centre to convey the following message to the parties and to Mr. Zuleta and Prof. Bucher (the \"**Two Members**\"):\n\nMesdames, Gentlemen,\n\nA few days ago, I received from the ICSID Secretariat a letter from counsel for the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/21, Fabrica De Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois De Venezuela, C.A. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, accompanied by two attachments. I enclose copy of that letter and the attachments. I also enclose a reply to counsel for the Respondent in that case dated 15 July 2016 from Ms Marisa Planells-Valero, ICSID Secretary of that tribunal.\n\nI also enclose my letter of explanations to Ms Planells-Valero dated 22 July which Ms Planells-Valero has now forwarded to the parties in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/21 and to the other members of that tribunal.\n\nAs the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is also the Respondent in ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30 and as I am also a member of that Tribunal, I have asked the ICSID Secretary of that Tribunal to send to the parties and the other members of that Tribunal my letter of today's date to Ms Planells-Valero and all documents therein referred to.\n\nThese circumstances do not in any way cause my reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by any party to the instant proceeding but, in view of the history of this arbitration, I thought I should make the present disclosure. [attachments omitted]\n\n5.\n\nThe explanations to which Mr. Fortier referred are transcribed below:\n\nDear Marisa,\n\nI have seen the Respondent's letter of 8 July 2016 with two annexes addressed to you. I have also seen your email of 14 July addressed to the parties, the Respondent's communication of 14 July and your reply of 15 July. I am happy to provide the following explanations.\n\nI recall that I resigned as a partner of Norton Rose OR LLP on 31 December 2011 and that I then severed definitively my professional relationship with that firm. As of 1 January 2012, I commenced my practice as a sole and independent international arbitrator with Cabinet Yves Fortier. When I left Norton Rose OR LLP, I was sitting as an arbitrator (Chairman or party-appointed) on many arbitral tribunals. I then had two secretaries, Ms. Linda Tucci (\"Linda\") and Ms. Chantal Robichaud (\"Chantal\"), working exclusively for me. They had both been working with me for many years.\n\nIn order to ensure that I could continue my busy practice as an international arbitrator after 31 December 2011 with the least possible disruption, I asked Linda and Chantal if they would be prepared to continue to work with me at Cabinet Yves Fortier. They accepted as long as they could continue to participate in all insurance and other benefits to which they were entitled with Services OR LP/SEC (see below).\n\nServices OR LP/SEC is a distinct legal entity set up by Norton Rose OR LLP for the purpose of providing staff and administrative support services to Norton Rose OR LLP. When I resigned as a partner of Norton Rose OR LLP, I entered into a service arrangement with Services OR LP/SEC with respect to the services of Linda and Chantal at the Cabinet Yves Fortier as of 1 January 2012.\n\nAccordingly, Linda and Chantal followed me physically to the Cabinet Yves Fortier where they worked exclusively for me as of 1 January 2012. They continued to be paid by Services OR LP/SEC who, every month, presented me with an invoice representing the amount of their salaries and the cost of their incidental benefits. I have settled these monthly invoices with Services OR LP/SEC since 1 January 2012.\n\nChantal left my Cabinet in July 2013. I then hired Myriam Ntashamaje (\"Myriam\") in August 2013 under the same arrangement as Chantal as I wanted her to have the same treatment as Linda. Since that time, Myriam has worked and continues to work exclusively for the Cabinet Yves Fortier. As I did in Chantal's case, I reimburse Services OR LP/SEC every month for her salary and the cost of all her incidental benefits.\n\nMyriam has never worked for Norton Rose Fulbright and is not an attorney. She is a secretary who assists me clerically in my arbitration files including the present one. The entry in her LinkedIn profile is inaccurate. Her own electronic signature on her email communications on my behalf or on behalf of my colleague, Ms Annie Lesp\u00e9rance, is very clear. It reads as follows:\n\n*Myriam Ntashamaje* Legal assistant to *The Hon. L. Yves Fortier, P.C., CC, OQ, QC and Ms. Annie Lesp\u00e9rance*\n\nTo be clear, Me Annie Lesp\u00e9rance, whom the parties met in April at the Paris hearing, is the only lawyer who works with me at the Cabinet Yves Fortier. She is remunerated directly by me.\n\nI hope these explanations answer to their satisfaction the questions which counsel for the Respondent put to the ICSID Secretary, Ms Marisa Planells-Valero, on 8 July 2016.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nYves Fortier QC Montreal, 22 July 2016\n\n6.\n\nOn the same day, Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier (the **\"Proposal**\"), as follows:\n\nWe have just received the attached communication from Mr. Fortier disclosing his arrangement with Services OR LP/SEC, which Mr. Fortier says is an entity organized by Norton Rose OR LLP \"for the purpose of providing staff and administrative support services to Norton Rose OR LLP.\" As we understand it, in this manner, Mr. Fortier's staff remain paid by Services OR LP/SEC and receive the insurance and other benefits offered to other Norton Rose personnel. We further understand from Mr. Fortier's disclosure that he is billed monthly by Services OR LP/SEC for the cost of his staff's salaries and benefits. We do not understand how this arrangement could even be possible without an affiliation between the firms, but in any event it seems obvious that the arrangement provides Mr. Fortier with the substantial benefits of allowing him to retain and hire new staff while relieving him of the burden and substantial additional cost involved in setting up an equivalent benefits plan for Cabinet Yves Fortier.\n\nFrankly, with all that has transpired in this case, we find this disclosure now to be shocking. We are disturbed both by the substance of the disclosure, which one would have thought would have been more appropriately made long ago, and by the extremely uncomfortable position we are now in, less than one month before the hearing Respondent has been asking for since September 2013. Much as Respondent is looking forward to that long awaited hearing, it is not prepared to waive any part of its objections to Mr. Fortier's serving as arbitrator in this case.\n\nWe are therefore again constrained to propose the disqualification of Mr. Fortier pursuant to Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention, unless of course he voluntarily resigns. We see no reason to repeat any of the factual background or legal arguments of the prior challenges, which we incorporate herein by reference. We urge Mr. Zuleta and Prof. Bucher to decide this challenge as soon as possible. If the decision is to reject the challenge, the August hearing dates should be preserved. If the decision is made to uphold the challenge, we understand that an unfortunate consequence would be to postpone the August hearing, but in that event we would be in favor of rescheduling to the earliest possible dates.\n\nWe deeply regret that we have been placed in this situation, but have no choice but to pursue this course because we sincerely believe that Mr. Fortier should not continue to serve on this Tribunal and Respondent must be assured that it will not face any argument of waiver in the event of any subsequent proceedings if it does not now make this proposal. [footnote omitted]\n\n7.\n\nUpon receipt of this Proposal, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken with respect to the Proposal.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of the same day, the Claimants objected to the Proposal in the following terms:\n\nWe write in opposition to the Respondent's seventh proposal to disqualify Mr. Fortier as arbitrator in this proceeding, and ninth arbitrator challenge overall, submitted today.\n\nThe challenge can and should be disposed of immediately, without any further briefing. The Respondent has not even attempted to articulate a colorable basis for its latest disqualification proposal, instead invoking \"all that has transpired in this case.\" What has in fact transpired is that Venezuela has raised six frivolous challenges to Mr. Fortier, each rejected either unanimously by the unchallenged Tribunal Members, or by the Chairman of the Administrative Council. In particular, the apparent basis of the new challenge - Mr. Fortier's alleged connection to Norton Rose Fulbright - has already been dismissed on multiple occasions.\n\nThe only \"new fact\" alleged is that Mr. Fortier has used Services OR LP/SEC as a service provider for purposes of paying compensation to two secretaries at his independent law office, Cabinet Yves Fortier. Mr. Fortier has explained, without contradiction, that this is an arms-length administrative arrangement. This \"fact\" is therefore entirely inconsequential: it does not call Mr. Fortier's impartiality into question in any way, much less could it satisfy the high standard for disqualification that this Tribunal has rightly established. The Claimants therefore respectfully request that the unchallenged Members of the Tribunal reject the proposal summarily so that this latest distraction does not interfere with the Parties' hearing preparations.\n\nThe Claimants also request an immediate award of all the costs they have incurred in responding to Venezuela's baseless challenges, which the Claimants will quantify immediately upon receipt of the unchallenged Members' decision. If ever a costs order were justified, it is here - where the Respondent, a serial abuser of the challenge mechanism, has continued to recycle allegations that have already been rejected on multiple occasions. [footnotes omitted]\n\n9.\n\nOn July 23, 2016, Respondent replied to Claimants' letter as follows:\n\nWe agree with Claimants that no further briefing is required on the pending proposal to disqualify Mr. Fortier. We only wish to remind Claimants that they previously argued against disqualification of Mr. Fortier on the ground that he had severed all financial and professional ties to Norton Rose. They boldly asserted the following on October 25, 2011: \"As of December 31, 2011, Maitre Fortier will therefore have no financial or professional ties to Norton Rose.... Maitre Fortier will have thus severed all financial ties to Norton Rose prior to the merger between Norton Rose and Macleod Dixon set to take place on January 1, 2012.\" It is hard to reconcile that with Mr. Fortier's latest disclosures. Claimants may not appreciate, or more likely simply wish to ignore, the obvious financial benefits the previously undisclosed \"service\" arrangement has provided to Mr. Fortier, but that does not change the facts. A small firm with few employees is not able to offer the same benefits package at the same cost as a large firm, and the additional savings resulting from not having to hire staff to design and administer employee benefits plans is significant, as anyone with experience in these matters knows.\n\nWe are offended at Claimants' continued accusations concerning these challenges. They act is if we are responsible for the non-disclosures of continuing relationships between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose. While Claimants are not concerned about each new revelation, Respondent certainly is. As we explained in our letter of yesterday, we sincerely regret that this latest disclosure has put us in the position of again having to challenge Mr. Fortier, but Respondent cannot be placed in the position of having to sit back and accept what it considers to be unacceptable and risk waiver of its strong objection to Mr. Fortier's continued service on this Tribunal. We join Claimants in requesting an expedited decision on the challenge.\n\n10.\n\nHaving reviewed the parties' submissions, the President of the Tribunal consulted with Professor Bucher and informed the parties on July 23, 2016, that (i) the Proposal would be decided on the basis of the communications already received; (ii) Mr. Fortier would have until noon Monday, July 25, 2016, to furnish any additional explanation he may wish to make in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3); and (iii) the dates of the August hearing would be maintained, pending the outcome of the Proposal.\n\n11.\n\nAs scheduled, on July 25, 2016, Mr. Fortier provided his explanations pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3), as follows:\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIn accordance with the schedule which you established, I now provide you with very brief additional explanations.\n\n1) As to the facts, they are set out in my e-mail of 22 July to Ms Marisa Planells-Valero in ICSID Case No. ARB /12/21 which is part of the record together with all documents therein referred to.\n\n2) I note that the Respondent in its letter of 22 July 2016 proposing my disqualification suggests that I should \"voluntarily resign[s]\".\n\n3) I see no reason to resign from this Tribunal. The service arrangement between Cabinet Yves Fortier and Services OR LP/SEC with respect to the services of my secretaries since 1 January 2012 does not in any way cause my reliability for independent judgment and impartiality in the present case to be put into question. Respectfully,\n\nYves Fortier\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Two Members recall that:\n\n(a) Articles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather, it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias;\n\n(b) The standard to be applied to Respondent's Proposal is whether a reasonable third person, with knowledge of all the facts, would conclude, on an objective basis, that the challenged arbitrator is manifestly lacking in the ability to act impartially (Article 14 read with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention);\n\n(c) The allegation that serves as the basis for the challenge, assuming it can be established, must be capable of being related to the present case, that is, that the particular facts must give rise to a manifest lack of independence and impartiality in this case; and\n\n(d) A non-disclosure does not in itself result in disqualification. The IBA Guidelines, endorsed by an ICSID decision on this point, provide that nondisclosure cannot make an arbitrator partial or lacking in independence; it is only the facts and circumstances that he did not disclose that can do so.\n\n13.\n\nThe facts on which the Proposal relies concern an arrangement under which the company \"Services OR LP/SEC\" pays the salaries and the cost of incidental benefits of two staff members working for the Cabinet Yves Fortier (Ms. Linda Tucci and Ms. Chantal Robichaud, the latter being replaced in August 2013 by Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje). Services OR LP/SEC invoices Cabinet Yves Fortier for the corresponding amounts on a monthly basis. Cabinet Yves Fortier has paid the invoices to Services OR LP/SEC since 1 January 2012. Services OR LP/SEC is also providing such service to Norton Rose OR LLP.\n\n14.\n\nRespondent does not dispute the fact that Services OR LP/SEC is a distinct legal entity. Respondent submits, however, that the provision of services both to Norton Rose OR LLP and to the Cabinet Yves Fortier could not \"be possible without an affiliation between the firms\". Respondent does not, however, provide evidence or support of any nature for the alleged affiliation. The Proposal is therefore based only on the fact that the Cabinet Yves Fortier receives services relating to the employment of two of its staff members that are of the same nature as the services provided by the same company to Norton Rose OR LLP.\n\n15.\n\nRespondent alleges that the arrangement provides Mr. Fortier with the \"substantial benefits of allowing him to retain and hire new staff while relieving him of the burden and substantial additional cost involved in setting up an equivalent benefits plan for the Cabinet Yves Fortier\". Even assuming this to be correct, Respondent does not show in any way why and in what respect such advantages and benefits may have any effect on Mr. Fortier's activity as arbitrator in this case. The mere fact that Mr. Fortier's Cabinet and Norton Rose OR LLP have recourse to the same provider of services in respect of the administration of employment matters relating to their respective staff does not reveal any ties or influence between the two firms in respect of their legal work and responsibilities. Respondent does not conclude otherwise.\n\n16.\n\nMore significantly, the Two Members cannot see how the facts relating to those services provide support for the proposition that such an indirect and purely administrative tie with Norton Rose would lead a reasonable third person with knowledge of those facts to the conclusion that Mr. Fortier is manifestly lacking in the ability to act impartially between the parties in the present arbitration.\n\n17.\n\nRespondent invokes in support of its new Proposal the \"factual background\" and \"legal arguments\" of its prior challenges, which it declares to \"incorporate herein by reference\". However, Respondent does not cite new facts requiring the Two Members to reconsider facts already considered in the earlier requests for disqualification, much less indicates how this alleged new facts relate to the facts in prior challenges to Mr. Fortier. In this regard, the Two Members cannot accept that they can be seized with a 'cumulative record' of this and all prior proposals for Mr. Fortier's disqualification. The Two Members are seized only with the Proposal made on July 22, 2016. The Proposal does not allege new facts requiring them to reconsider the facts alleged in relation to prior requests for disqualification.\n\n**C. COSTS**\n------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Two Members see no reason to depart from the standard practice of determining costs issues at the end of the proceeding.\n\n**D. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n19.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Two Members:\n\n(1) decide to dismiss the Proposal made by the Respondent to disqualify Mr. Yves Fortier as Arbitrator, and\n\n(2) decide to defer the application made by the Claimants for an order for costs to a later stage in the proceedings."}, {"Title": "Interim Decision", "Type": "Award (Interim)", "Date": "2017-01-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Interim Decision\n----------------\n\n**I. Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 2 November 2007, the Claimants submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") a Request for Arbitration against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"Venezuela\" or \"the Respondent\") pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention. On 13 December 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on 23 July 2008. Its members were Judge Kenneth Keith, President, appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention; The Hon. L. Yves Fortier, QC, appointed by the Claimants; and Sir Ian Brownlie, CBE, QC, appointed by the Respondent. On 1 February 2010, the Tribunal was reconstituted, with Professor Georges Abi-Saab being appointed by the Respondent, following Sir Ian Brownlie's passing.\n\n3.\n\nFrom 31 May to 12 June 2010 a hearing took place on jurisdiction and merits, followed by two days of pleadings on 21 and 23 July 2010. On 3 September 2013, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits (\"the 2013 Decision\"), stating in its paragraph 404 the conclusions quoted below in part II.\n\n4.\n\nOn 8 September 2013, Counsel for the Respondent submitted a letter requesting a clarification and further explanations from the Tribunal regarding certain findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits relating in particular to the 2013 Decision's conclusion on the negotiation on compensation that took place between the Parties (the \"First Application for Reconsideration\"). In its letter, Counsel for the Respondent also requested \"a limited and focused hearing\" to address the specific issues raised.\n\n5.\n\nCounsel for the Claimants replied to the Respondent's letter on 10 September 2013. The Claimants opposed the Respondent's requests and proposed instead a briefing schedule for submissions on *quantum*.\n\n6.\n\nBetween 11 and 23 September 2013, several further letters were submitted to the Tribunal by the Parties.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 1 October 2013, the Tribunal fixed a schedule for the Parties to file submissions on: (i) the Tribunal's power to reconsider the 2013 Decision; and (ii) a possible scheduling for *quantum* briefs. The Parties duly submitted two rounds of written pleadings.\n\n8.\n\nIn its Decision of 10 March 2014 the Tribunal stated that so far as the matter set out in the Respondent's Application for Reconsideration was concerned \"this decision is limited to answering the question whether the Tribunal has the power which the Respondent would have it exercise. The decision does not address the grounds the Respondent invokes for reconsidering the part of the Decision which it challenges and the evidence which it sees as supporting those grounds. The power must be shown to exist before it can be ex-ercised\".1\n\nDecision of 10 March 2014 on Respondent's First Request for Reconsideration, para. 9.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that it did not have the power to reconsider the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, with Professor Georges Abi-Saab dissenting. In the absence of such power it implicitly followed in the Tribunal's Decision that the Respondent's Request was dismissed.\n\n10.\n\nProfessor Georges Abi-Saab resigned on 20 February 2015 with immediate effect. On 10 August 2015 the Tribunal was reconstituted, with Professor Andreas Bucher being appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n11.\n\nOn that same day, 10 August 2015, the Respondent submitted a Second Application for Reconsideration directed at the Tribunal's Decision of 10 March 2014. It requested a hearing on the application. The Respondent recalled that it had, immediately following the 2013 Decision, applied for reconsideration, pointing out certain obvious factual, legal and logical errors the correction of any one of which would require a change in the majority's conclusions on the issue of good faith negotiations. Of particular relevance to this [Second] Application, Respondent pointed out that cables from the U.S. Embassy released after the hearing in this case in 2010, which reported on the briefings made by the chief ConocoPhillips negotiators to the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, left no doubt that the representations made by ConocoPhillips to the Tribunal regarding Respondent's supposed unwillingness to negotiate fair market value had been completely false, and that it was in fact ConocoPhillips which was seeking compensation \u2018on top of the fair market value of the assets.' Since the majority had relied on Claimants' misrepresentations in reaching its conclusion on bad faith negotiation, Respondent assumed that the Tribunal would want to reconsider the Majority Merits Decision to avoid an obvious gross miscarriage of justice. That assumption was based on the premise that every tribunal has the power to correct its own decision while the case is still pending before it and should exercise that power if its decision were indeed based on patently false representations. (footnote omitted)2\n\nRespondent's Second Application for Reconsideration, pp. 2-3.\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 August 2015, the Claimants responded in these terms:\n\nThe application is frivolous and dilatory. Venezuela has not even attempted to articulate a legal basis for the admissibility of a request to reconsider a reconsideration decision \u2013 because there is none. The Tribunal's 10 March Decision considered and rejected the same arguments that Venezuela now raises. It has *res judicata* effect and may not be revisited or reviewed in any way prior to the rendering of the final Award.3\n\nThe Claimants requested that the Tribunal dismiss the Respondent's application forthwith and promptly reschedule the final hearing.\n\nClaimants' letter of 12 August 2015, p. 1.\n\n13.\n\nLater that same day, the Respondent commented upon the Claimants' letter. On 13 August 2015 the Claimants stated that their letter of the previous day provided a complete answer to the Respondent's points in its later letter.\n\n14.\n\nOn 15 August 2015, the Parties were advised that the Tribunal \"is currently considering the Respondent's application, including its request for a hearing, and will revert to the parties in due course. The Tribunal considers that no further submissions are needed at this point.\"4\n\nICSID's letter of 15 August 2015, p. 2.\n\n15.\n\nOn 9 November 2015, the Respondent submitted a proposal to disqualify L. Yves Fortier QC as arbitrator. In terms of Rule 9(6) of the Arbitration Rules, the proceeding was suspended until 15 December 2015 when the proposal was dismissed. Two further proposals were made by the Respondent on 26 February 2016 and 22 July 2016 (Respondent's Fifth and Sixth Proposals to disqualify L. Yves Fortier), both dismissed on 15 March 2016 and 26 July 2016, respectively.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal rendered its Decision on the Respondent's Second Application for Reconsideration on 9 February 2016. It explained that it had approached the matter, as have the Parties, in terms of seeking the existence and source of the power the Respondent would have it exercise. It is not a matter of finding a rule prohibiting the existence or exercise of such a power. That power has to be found to exist. The Respondent has failed to make such demonstration.\n\n17.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal, by a majority, dismissed the Second Application for Reconsideration made by the Respondent for the reconsideration of its Decision on Respondent's First Request for Reconsideration of 10 March 2014, with Professor Andreas Bucher dissenting.\n\n18.\n\nOn 24 February 2016, the Tribunal held an Organizational Hearing in Washington, D.C., where several outstanding matters of procedure were discussed, including the scheduling and the agenda of the forthcoming hearings on *quantum*. A number of procedural issues were recorded in the Minutes and further refined in ICSID's letter of 8 June 2016.\n\n19.\n\nOn 21 March 2016, the President of the Tribunal, Judge Kenneth J. Keith resigned as arbitrator in this case with immediate effect. On 22 April 2016 the Tribunal was reconstituted, with Mr. Eduardo Zuleta being appointed as presiding arbitrator by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n20.\n\nOn 21 March 2016, the Respondent submitted the Updated Expert Report of Vladimir Brailovsky and Daniel Flores, dated 18 March 2016. On the same date, the Claimants submitted the March 2016 Update prepared by their Experts Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller (Compass Lexecon).\n\n21.\n\nOn 21 April 2016, the Claimants submitted the Rebuttal Expert Report prepared by Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller (Compass Lexecon) and the Second Expert Report of Richard Strickland, while, on the same date, the Respondent communicated the Valuation Update Reply prepared by Vladimir Brailovsky and Daniel Flores.\n\n22.\n\nIn accordance with the conclusions of the Organizational Hearing, the Claimants submitted on 15 April 2016 additional exhibits in the record (C-623 to C-671), as did the Respondent (R-603 to R-641).\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated April 20, 2016, the Respondent filed with the Tribunal the Third Application for Reconsideration of the Majority's Decision of 9 February 2016, containing the equivalent request than in the preceding two earlier applications. In effect, this Third Application contained the same grounds as the Respondent's two earlier Applications. The Claimants responded by letter of 21 April 2016.\n\n24.\n\nAt the Organizational Hearing of 24 February 2016, the Claimants were ordered to produce a number of documents, which the Tribunal considered were not privileged. By letter of 11 May 2016, the Tribunal decided the last remaining issue in respect of the production of documents.\n\n25.\n\nAnother decision of the Tribunal at the Organizational Hearing was to invite the Parties to comment on the issues other than *quantum* that they considered were still outstanding, if any. The Tribunal received submissions from the Claimants on 2 March 2016 and from the Respondent on 11 March 2016. After due deliberation, the Tribunal considered it necessary to invite the Parties, by letter dated 17 March 2016, to file an additional round of submissions, which were received from the Claimants on 15 April 2016 and from the Respondent on 15 May 2016. The Parties were invited to specifically address the Claimants' request for a declaration of breach of Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal held a first phase of the hearing on *quantum* on 15-19 August 2016 in respect of the following issues: (i) the scope of the Tribunal's finding on Article 6(c) of the BIT and the outcome of the Claimants' claim for a declaration that the Respondent breached Article 6 of the BIT; (ii) the Respondent's Third Application for Reconsideration; (iii) the *misrepresentation* allegation; (iv) the relevance of the *compensation formulas* and (v) the impact of the ongoing ICC arbitration proceedings, if any.5\n\nThe hearing was recorded and a transcript established, as this had been done for the 24 February 2016 Organizational Hearing and for the hearings held on 31 May to 12 June and 21 and 23 July 2010. The Tribunal uses the condensed version of the transcripts. Unless otherwise mentioned, the references in the present decision are made to the transcript of the August 2016 Hearing.\n\n27.\n\nAt the end of the hearing on 19 August 2016 and after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, providing in particular as follows:\n\n1. The Tribunal remains seized of the Respondent's Request for Reconsideration dated April 20, 2016, and of Respondent's misrepresentation claim. The Tribunal considers that it has been fully briefed on these matters, which therefore need not be addressed further.\n\n2. Pursuant to the Tribunal's order of August 17, 2016, the parties shall file with the Tribunal all documents exchanged or presentations made between them in the course of their negotiations between November 27, 2007 and September 2008, by August 31, 2016.\n\n3. By September 19, 2016, the parties shall submit post-hearing briefs addressing the evidence adduced in the course of the hearing. The parties may include in their post-hearing briefs comments with respect to the documents produced pursuant to paragraph No. 2 above.\n\n28.\n\nProcedural Order No. 4 further provided that the Parties shall proceed through joint and expeditious cooperation in establishing new and consolidated expert reports (1) on the production capacities of the Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro Projects (para. 4) and (2) on the amount of damages resulting from the expropriation of the three Projects (para. 5), in each case on the basis of a jointly agreed structure of issues. In both cases, it was determined that the parties shall proceed through an initial exchange of their reports between them without copying the Tribunal and then revise the reports as necessary in order that each party may submit its final version to the Tribunal by 17 October 2016 for the reports on production capacities and by 17 November 2016 for the reports on damages.\n\n29.\n\nFurther instructions were given to the Parties by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 4 in respect of the substance of the expert reports on the amount of damages, which shall contain determinations on whether the valuation was made at the date of the expropriation, *i.e.* 26 June 2007, or on 31 December 2016, in each case taking into account, or not taking into account, the compensation formulas contained in the Association Agreements (para. 6). The final briefs on *quantum* were scheduled for 30 December 2016 (para. 7). The Order fixed the dates for the hearing on the second *quantum* phase at 21-25 February 2017 (para. 8), to which a further hearing was added by ICSID's letter 2 September 2016 for 27-31 March 2017.\n\n30.\n\nOn 31 August 2016, the Tribunal received from each party a set of presentations that had been used in the course of the negotiations between 27 November 2007 and 8 September 2008. Most of the documents submitted by each party were identical.6\n\nThe Claimants' Exhibits C-688 to C-694; Annexes 1 to 10 to the Respondent's letter dated 31 August 2016.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants' and the Respondent's Post-Hearing Briefs were filed with the Tribunal on 19 September 2016.\n\n32.\n\nIn compliance with the procedure provided in paragraph 4 of the Order and the adjustments noted by the Tribunal's letters of 5 September and 3 October 2016, the Parties submitted consolidated expert reports on the production capacities of the three Projects on 17 October 2016 as follows: the Claimants' Expert Reports prepared respectively by Richard Strickland and by Neil K. Earnest of Muse Stancil; the Respondent's Expert Report of Jes\u00fas Rafael Pati\u00f1o Murillo.\n\n33.\n\nFollowing the procedure provided in paragraph 5 of the Order, the Parties submitted consolidated expert reports on the amount of damages resulting from the expropriation of the three Projects on 17 November 2016 as follows: The Claimants' Consolidated Update Report on the Damages Assessment for the Taking of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela prepared by their Experts Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller (Compass Lexecon), and the Respondent's Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation prepared by Vladimir Brailovsky and Daniel Flores.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their Final Submission on Quantum, and the Respondent its Brief on Quantum, both on 30 December 2016.\n\n35.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's invitation in its 6 May 2016 letter, the Parties communicated their submissions and valuation reports they had filed until 20 May 2016 with the ICC Tribunal (Case No. 20549/ASM), where ConocoPhillips are the claimants and PdVSA and two if its subsidiaries are the respondents. These briefs were complementary to the two Requests for Arbitration dated 10 October 2014, copies of which were communicated at an earlier date to this Tribunal (R-494, R-495). Each party provided explanatory comments related to these proceedings by letters both dated 20 May 2016. On 16 September 2016, the Respondent filed with the Tribunal its Rejoinder submitted in the ICC proceedings on 9 September 2016. Finally, with the Claimants' agreement and as agreed by the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted on 16 December 2016 the transcript of the hearing that took place from 28 November to 10 December 2016 in the ICC Arbitration (R-654). By letter to the Parties dated 19 December 2016, the Tribunal recalled that pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Minutes of the Organizational Hearing of 24 February 2016, as reiterated in its directions of 6 May, 1 July and 12 September 2016, this material has been received for information purposes only and will not, accordingly, be accorded any evidentiary value in this case. The Tribunal also informed the Parties in its letter dated 23 December 2016 that it does not grant leave for the Parties to submit documents referred to during the ICC hearing or other documents not on the record in the ICC Arbitration, or to file additional legal authorities.\n\n**II. The 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe conclusions reached by the Tribunal's 2013 Decision read as follows:\n\n404. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. It does not have jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Investment Law and accordingly the claims by ConocoPhillips Company are dismissed; and\n\nb. It has jurisdiction under Article 9 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty over:   \ni. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV, ConocoPhilips Hamaca BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of (1) the increase in the income tax rate which came into effect on 1 January 2007 and (2) the expropriation or migration; and   \nii. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of the increase in the extraction tax in effect from 24 May 2006.\n\nc. All claims based on a breach of Article 3 of the BIT are rejected.\n\nd. The Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT.\n\ne. The date of valuation of the ConocoPhillips assets is the date of the Award.\n\nf. All other claims based on a breach of Article 6(c) of the BIT are rejected.\n\ng. All other questions, including those concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the parties' determination are reserved for future determination.\n\nItems (a), (b)(i), (b)(ii), (c), (f) and (g) above have been decided unanimously by the Tribunal. Items (d) and (e) have been decided by majority, with Arbitrator Georges Abi-Saab dissenting.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal's Majority has decided twice that it had no power to examine the Respondent's Application for Reconsideration, each time with the third arbitrator dissenting.\n\n38.\n\nNonetheless, the true meaning and effects of the 2013 Decision's statement in respect of the Respondent's conduct of the negotiation on compensation in paragraph 404(d) remained a matter of debate. The Tribunal felt that further clarity was useful in relation to the obligation prohibiting expropriation by the host State as contained in Article 6 of the BIT, and in relation to the assessment of the Claimants' claim for damages. Further procedural developments, and particularly the August 2016 Hearing, had the effect of providing a broader view on the negotiations that actually took place between the Parties, including in the period between November 2007 and September 2008, which the Tribunal was not able to evaluate in the prior proceeding that was concluded by the 2013 Decision. Further, the Respondent submitted a claim based on alleged misrepresentations made by the Claimants to the Tribunal. Therefore, the Tribunal decided that the Respondent's Third Application for Reconsideration and the misrepresentation allegation were both to be addressed at the August 2016 Hearing. Both matters will be examined below, considering in the first place the content of the 2013 Decision's statement in respect of the negotiations on compensation, before analyzing the negotiations in 2007 and 2008.\n\n**III. The True Meaning of the 2013 Decision's Findings in Respect of the Negotiations on Compensation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. Introduction\n---------------\n\n39.\n\nIn order to assist the understanding of the Tribunal's finding under letter d) of paragraph 404 of its 2013 Decision, it is helpful to repeat the exact wording of this provision, which reads as follows:\n\nd. The Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT.\n\n40.\n\nThe very essence of this provision is contained in the terms \"obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation\". On a narrower look, the key terms expressing the content of the obligation referred to are: \"to negotiate in good faith\". The first question to be addressed is about the meaning of this expression. Contrary to what may appear at one's mind as a first impression, there is not only one meaning. Indeed, more than one meaning can be attributed to these terms and to the whole sentence: (1) One of them would mean that the Respondent did not negotiate with good faith; (2) another one would say that the Respondent did not negotiate, either \"at all\" or at least \"seriously\" or otherwise with the required involvement. Indeed, the obligation to negotiate in good faith may also be breached by a party that refuses or omits to negotiate, while still acting in good faith (*e.g*. because the host State has no funds left to pay and accepts its obligation). Thus, undoubtedly, a problem of interpretation is raised.\n\n41.\n\nThe problem results from the polysemic content of the expression \"negotiate in good faith\". If considered as a legal requirement, its conditions are not fulfilled (1) by a party not acting in good faith, but also (2) by a party not negotiating, even being in good faith. In other words, the expression contains two cumulative requirements: (1) negotiate, and (2) in good faith; if either one is not fulfilled, the requirement is not met. Thus, the question is: what was the meaning under consideration by the Tribunal when rendering the 2013 Decision? Was the Decision finding a breach of an obligation to negotiate in good faith (1) because the Respondent was not acting in good faith, or was the breach caused by the Respondent (2) because of its omission to negotiate (somehow \"sufficiently\")?\n\nB. The Respondent's Position\n----------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent understood the statement as having the first meaning, *i.e.* the Tribunal finding that the Respondent did not endeavor in good faith to negotiate the Claimants' compensation.\n\n43.\n\nIn its First Application for Reconsideration dated 8 September 2013, the Respondent complained that the Tribunal in its Decision had found lack of good faith on the part of the Respondent in the negotiation on compensation. In its first brief on the matter of Reconsideration, dated 28 October 2013, the Respondent noted:\n\n\u2026 two members of the Tribunal, with Prof. Abi-Saab dissenting, went on to find lack of good faith on the part of the Republic in the compensation negotiations and, as a consequence, that the nationalization was unlawful.\" (para. 2). Respondent further mentioned the \"majority's finding of lack of good faith (para. 3)\n\nIn its second brief dated 25 November 2013, the Respondent referred to the \"majority's startling finding of lack of good faith negotiation\" (para. 71).\n\n44.\n\nIn its Second Application for Reconsideration, dated 10 August 2015, the Respondent explained that the 2013 Decision found that the nationalization was rendered unlawful due to a purported failure of the Respondent to negotiate compensation based on the principle of fair market value, \"which, according to the majority, meant that the Respondent did not negotiate compensation in good faith\" (page 2), further referring to the Majority's \"conclusion on bad faith negotiation\" (page 3).\n\n45.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on Quantum of 18 August 2014, the Respondent refers to the Majority's \"finding of bad faith negotiation\" (paras. 3, 36, 173). The Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum of 7 January 2015 mentions the \"majority's finding of bad faith negotiation\" (paras. 7, 11, 300, 315), but without discussing the issue of \"good faith\". The Rejoinder submits strongly that the Respondent did effectively negotiate fair market value (paras. 12, 27, 28).\n\n46.\n\nAt the August 2016 Hearing, the Respondent included in its opening statement numerous references to the Tribunal's conclusion on Venezuela having behaved in bad faith when negotiating compensation.7 For Witness Mommer, \"it never crossed my mind we would be accused of bad-faith negotiations\".8 The Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief again referred to the \"majority finding on bad faith negotiation\" (paras. 8, 21), further noting that Venezuela had been \"found to have negotiated in bad faith\" (para. 35). Similar statements are contained in the Respondent's Brief on Quantum (paras. 3, 5, 14).\n\nTR-E, Day 1, p. 114/20, 115/4-5, 116/9, 117/6, 137/7, 11, 138/10-11, 142/12-13, 148/11.\n\nTR-E, Day 4, p. 1103/14-15.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent thus understands that the 2013 Decision's statement in paragraph 404(d) blamed the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for not having acted in good faith in its relations with the Claimants on the matter of compensation.\n\nC. The Claimants' Position\n--------------------------\n\n48.\n\nIn their submission of 28 October 2013 on the Respondent's First Application for Reconsideration, the Claimants noted that the Tribunal had decided that Venezuela's expropriation of the ConocoPhillips Parties' investments was unlawful \"because Venezuela refused to offer more than book value for the expropriated assets (or anything for Corocoro) in connection with the expropriations and, therefore, failed to negotiate prompt, adequate and effective compensation in good faith.\" (para. 1) This presentation does not identify any act contrary to good faith. The focus is exclusively on the Respondent's purported failure to offer more than book value. While the Respondent is blamed for not having offered compensation with its three inherent requirements through negotiations conducted in good faith, the Claimants do not indicate in any way which of these attributes \u2013 applicable cumulatively \u2013 was not complied with.\n\n49.\n\nIn their second submission, dated 25 November 2013, the Claimants stated that the issue to be examined \"was the issue of whether Venezuela engaged in good faith negotiations to provide the Claimants with fair market value for all three expropriations\" (para. 31). Again, no distinction was made depending whether Venezuela was not negotiating or was not acting in good faith.\n\n50.\n\nIn their first Memorial on Quantum of 19 May 2014, the Claimants noted that \"the Tribunal held that Venezuela's expropriation of the Claimants' investments in June 2007 was contrary to the terms of Article 6 of the Treaty, and thus unlawful\" (para. 68), further quoting paragraph 401 of the 2013 Decision. The Claimants' Reply on Quantum of 13 October 2014 merely recalls that \"Venezuela failed to negotiate compensation in good faith\" (para. 26). It was further explained that: \"At no point during that eleven-month expropriation process did Venezuela pay fair market value compensation, propose a process for doing so, or even negotiate in accordance with that mandatory standard.\" (para. 88). Again, nowhere in these two briefs is any lack of good faith on the part of Venezuela taken as a distinct factual element with specific legal effects, including an obligation to provide for compensation.\n\n51.\n\nAt the August 2016 Hearing, it was stated on behalf of the Claimants that Venezuela did not sincerely negotiate as required by the principle of good faith, further noting that \"whether the State has engaged in good faith negotiations ultimately boils down to the question of whether it has made an offer of fair-market-value compensation\".9 In their PostHearing Brief, the Claimants explain that the 2013 Decision held that Venezuela \"did not satisfy even its antecedent obligation to negotiate in good faith against the FMV [fair market value] standard.\" (para. 10). The Claimants' Final Submission on Quantum contains similar statements (paras. 5, 65).\n\nTR-E, Day 1, p. 41/2-5.\n\nD. The Tribunal's Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n*1. The 2013 Decision's findings*\n---------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe question to be examined is whether the breach of the obligation referred to in paragraph 404(d) of the 2013 Decision was caused by the lack of negotiating by the Respondent and/or the lack of its acting in good faith. In both hypotheses, the Decision's identification of the relevant obligation that was breached is reached, because in both cases there would have been no \"negotiation in good faith\". The statement made under letter d) of the *dispositif* does not identify explicitly which part of this legal obligation was not complied with, or whether all parts of it have been breached.\n\n53.\n\nA review in detail and in context of the explanations provided by the Tribunal leads to the conclusion that the 2013 Decision does not mention the notion of bad faith in relation to the negotiations on the part of the Respondent. No bad faith was retained as a ground for the Decision's conclusion in paragraph 404(d). Indeed, the term \"bad faith\" is to be found in the 2013 Decision only once (para. 274), on a point relating to jurisdiction. It is never used in connection with the negotiations. This would seem sufficient to conclude that a purported breach of an obligation of acting in good faith is not contained in the *dispositif* in paragraph 404(d).\n\n54.\n\nFurther, the 2013 Decision never uses the term \"good faith\" alone. There is no statement indicating that the Respondent was not acting in good faith. When the words \"good faith\" are used, they are always connected to the term \"negotiate\". Therefore, when explaining that the Respondent did not \"negotiate in good faith\", the Decision does not specify whether this must be explained by the Respondent's attitude of not negotiating, or by its lack of good faith, or maybe both.\n\n55.\n\nThe term \"good faith\" is used 26 times in the Tribunal's explanations. Seven of these occurrences relate to matters of jurisdiction, not relevant for the present analysis (paras. 228, 232, 254, 273[3x], 275). In relation to the negotiations, the same term appears in several parts where the Parties' positions and the views of certain witnesses are presented, describing their respective role as negotiating partner acting in good faith: Respondent (paras. 358[2x], 374, 381[2x]), Claimants (paras. 365, 371, 372, 379 [\"good faith offer\"], 397[2x][\"good faith efforts\"]), Dr. Mommer (para. 385), Mr. Lyons (para. 388). None of these statements implies a negative judgment, *i.e.* criticizing the other party for not acting in good faith. Never is the term defined in any way.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal used the term \"good faith\", firstly, for the purpose of identifying the question to be examined. In paragraph 334(d), the question was raised: \"did the Respondent \u2026. negotiate in good faith in accordance with the standard in Article 6(c) \u2026\" The same words were used in the title before paragraph 361. In the following paragraph 362, the Tribunal noted that \"\u2026 it is also commonly accepted that the Parties must engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the standard set (\u2026)\". Secondly, the Tribunal did use the combined expression of \"negotiate\" and \"good faith\" in the explanation of its decision on the subject in paragraph 394, as follows: \"Considering the situation after 12 April 2007, the date of those three letters, the Tribunal, on the basis of the evidence before it, concludes that Venezuela at that time was not negotiating in good faith by reference to the standard of \"market value\" set out in the BIT.\" This was followed by this statement in paragraph 401: \"The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhil-lips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT,\u2026\", which are the terms reproduced in paragraph 404(d) of the Decision.\n\n57.\n\nThese quotations demonstrate that the Tribunal never made any distinction between \"negotiating\" and \"good faith\", using in all instances both terms conjunctively. The Decision does not identify whether the Respondent's breach of its obligation was due to the lack of either \"[sufficient] negotiation\" or \"good faith\" or both. The Tribunal notes also that the Decision contains only one single statement (para. 394) where a conclusion based on the evidence is made by reference to good faith.\n\n58.\n\nThe Decision never identifies the content of the term \"good faith\" nor does it attribute the failure to comply with this requirement to the Respondent. This means that the Decision in paragraph 404(d) is based on the Respondent's failure to negotiate on the basis of market value and not on a purported attitude of bad faith on part of the Respondent during the exchange of views that actually took place.\n\n59.\n\nFurthermore, if the lack of good faith, that is bad faith, was a legal requisite leading to the finding of a breach of the Respondent's obligation, one would expect that these concepts would be defined in the Decision and its components examined in their legal elements and in relation to the evidence. Nothing like this can be found in the Decision. In fact, when the Decision states that the Respondent was not negotiating in good faith, it referred to facts demonstrating that the Respondent failed to engage in negotiations leading to just compensation based on market value as required by Article 6(c). Nowhere does the Decision say, in relation to such failures on the part of the Respondent, that the Respondent was acting in bad faith.\n\n*2. Conclusion*\n---------------\n\n60.\n\nBased on the above analysis of the 2013 Decision, the conclusion is that the Tribunal did not find a lack of good faith on the part of the Respondent for its breach of an obligation to negotiate on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT. The Tribunal stated simply that the Respondent failed to be involved in negotiations leading to an offer complying with the requirements of \"just compensation\" and \"market value\".\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent is mistaken when it understood, since the filing of its First Application for Reconsideration, that the Tribunal had made a finding of bad faith in respect of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela's involvement in the negotiations. The 2013 Decision does not contain any such statement. The decision in paragraph 404(d) must be understood as stating that the Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate the compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips' assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT.\n\n62.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent's Third Application for Reconsideration must be considered as moot to the extent it required the Tribunal to review an assessment of lack of good faith in negotiating for compensation on the part of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which is not contained in the Tribunal's 2013 Decision. The Tribunal must dismiss the Application in this regard, irrespective of whether the Tribunal would have, or does not have the power to reconsider the Application (as decided twice by the Tribunal's Majority).\n\n63.\n\nIn its true meaning, the Tribunal's conclusion contained in paragraph 404(d) of the 2013 Decision is about the Respondent's breach of its obligation to negotiate compensation on the basis of market value. When the issue of good faith is set aside, the Respondent's Application for Reconsideration would have to be understood, as this is still argued by the Respondent before this Tribunal, that the Majority erred when it concluded that \"Claimants' allegations that the Republic never agreed to negotiate anything other than book value\"10.\n\nRespondent's First Brief dated 28 October 2013, para. 3.\n\n64.\n\nWhen the Tribunal's Majority rejected the Respondent's first and second Applications for Reconsideration, it equally dismissed this reduced part of the Applications, considering that the matter was beyond its power for decision.\n\n65.\n\nIn this respect as well, the 2013 Decision's conclusion is to be taken for what it says and nothing more. The Tribunal's statement was based on the factual evidence available at the relevant time. The Decision simply repeats what is explained in paragraph 401 that draws the conclusion of the Tribunal's analysis of the evidence, which all relates (with one exception11) to the period before this arbitral proceeding had been introduced, leaving out of the Tribunal's observation and gathering of evidence, negotiations that were covered by the Confidentiality Agreement effective as from 27 November 2007. Moreover, while deciding that the Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate compensation on the basis of market value, it does not contain a ruling on the consequences of such violation. The Tribunal's conclusion in paragraph 404(d) of its 2013 Decision does not explain the nature of the obligation to negotiate compensation based on fair market value, nor does it state its effects in case of a breach, and therefore has generated debate between the Parties as to whether or not such conclusion leads to a breach of Article 6 of the BIT.\n\nMinister Ram\u00edrez' speech to the Parliament on 14 February 2008 (C-190). It is true that the Tribunal drew a negative inference from the statement of the Minister that Venezuela was negotiating on the basis of book value only (2013 Decision, para. 400). However, the Tribunal also noted that it had no access to information on facts covered by the Confidentiality Agreement, thus showing that its reliance on the Minister's February 2008 statement was subject to caution.\n\n66.\n\nThe 2013 Decision did not preclude further consideration of further evidence relating to the negotiations actually ongoing after the date when the Request for Arbitration was submitted. The Tribunal placed emphasis on the lack of evidence concerning the negotiations conducted after the date of the expropriation \u2013 the \"final period\" \u2013, making clear that such evidence would have been relevant had it been forthcoming (para. 400). After the 2013 Decision was rendered, the Tribunal declared open the *quantum* phase12. In so doing, the Tribunal did not specify further the issues to be included in the examination of such *quantum*, nor did it elaborate on the legal basis of the damages thus to be determined. One of the items to be considered in this respect has to be the question of the effects of the breach identified in paragraph 404(d) of the 2013 Decision on the Claimants' claims for damages. This includes the question whether the Respondent's conduct after the time taken as relevant by the Tribunal in 2013, *e.g.* when the Confidentiality Agreement took effect, and until the final failure of the negotiations on compensation in September 2008, could also be qualified as constituting such a breach. Consideration of the Respondent's allegation that the Claimants misrepresented pertinent facts to the Tribunal is equally relevant in this respect. In the August 2016 Hearing these issues were extensively debated by the Parties.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration dated 10 March 2014.\n\n**IV. The Negotiations**\n------------------------\n\nA. Preliminary Observations\n---------------------------\n\n*1. The Respondent's claim based on the Claimants' alleged misrepresentations to the Tribunal*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nWhile assuming that the Tribunal had decided that Venezuela had been acting in bad faith when negotiating compensation for the taking of ConocoPhillips' assets, the Respondent objects to this conclusion and submits that it was based on materially false representations made by the Claimants to the Tribunal. The Respondent contends that the Claimants should not be allowed to take any advantage from their own wrongful conduct. The legal principle supporting this position would mean that the Claimants have to assume one of the consequences of the Tribunal's finding of bad faith on the part of the Respondent, which is to remove the valuation date from the date of the nationalization to the date of the Award.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent's claim introduces a new perspective relating to the negotiations on compensation that were ongoing in 2007 and 2008. Indeed, when considering whether the Respondent took part in the negotiations with the aim of reaching agreement on the basis of fair market value, the Tribunal has to examine whether the assertions and the evidence brought forward by the Claimants and submitted to the Tribunal were materially false representations, which, in the Respondent's view, may produce adverse legal effects for the Claimants.\n\n69.\n\nWhile the issue of misrepresentation will be dealt with in this Interim Decision, the Tribunal will not address today the Respondent's further contention that the Tribunal should reconsider the 2013 Decision which set the valuation date as the date of the Award. Even if the Tribunal had been seized with such a request,13 the Tribunal recalls that, for the forthcoming examination of the issues on damages, the Parties have been directed by paragraph 6 of Procedural Order No. 4 to focus on both 26 June 2007 and 31 December 2016 as possible valuation dates. Therefore, any question in relation to the matter of the valuation date will be dealt with at the appropriate stage of this proceeding.\n\nDuring the August 2016 Hearing Counsel for the Respondent made a remark that if the Tribunal would like a formal application to reconsider the issue, \"then consider it done\" (TR-E, Day 1, p. 203/10-11).\n\n*2. The fate of the Confidentiality Agreement*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe lack of information before the Tribunal on the negotiations ongoing since November 2007 was due to the Confidentiality Agreement concluded on 18 January 200814 that all Parties considered at the time binding, including during the proceeding leading to the 2013 Decision (paras. 395-400). No information was therefore submitted to the Tribunal. A failure to provide evidence is usually attributed to the Party bearing the burden of proof of the pertinent fact. In this case, both Parties failed to provide any evidence. Therefore, no adverse inference can be attributed to any of them for such reason. This also explains why the Tribunal's decision in paragraph 404(d) cannot extend to the period when no pertinent facts were available in respect of the ongoing negotiations since November 2007; the Tribunal had no facts on its record (other than the speech of Minister Ram\u00edrez) in this regard.\n\nC-579.\n\n71.\n\nBefore and during the August 2016 Hearing, the Parties expressed opposing views as to the relevance of the Confidentiality Agreement in respect of the examination of witnesses and a forthcoming production of new documents relating to the negotiations that took place during the period when the Confidentiality Agreement was in effect.\n\n72.\n\nThere is no dispute that both Parties respected their confidentiality obligations, except for the alleged breach by Mr. Goff's and Mr. Lyon's in their disclosures to the U.S. Embassy, which were revealed by the WikiLeaks cables' summaries of a number of meetings where ConocoPhillips' main negotiators reported to the Embassy about the ongoing negotiations with Venezuela's representatives. According to the Respondent, this was a breach of the Confidentiality Agreement.15\n\nTR-E, Day 2, p. 643/16-19; Day 3, p. 663/22-664/4.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants referred to Article 2 of the Agreement and submitted that there was no undertaking agreed upon that would preclude either side from revealing its own statements and positions. The Claimants further confirmed that the witnesses on both sides were free to answer questions put to them at the hearing without being constrained by the Confidentiality Agreement. Accordingly, the Claimants declared that they would not object to Venezuela putting questions to the Claimants' witnesses with respect to settlement discussions that occurred after the Confidentiality Agreement came into force. In addition, to the extent the Respondent would consider that its witnesses' ability to provide evidence on those matters was limited under the Confidentiality Agreement, the Claimants expressly released the Respondent from any such obligation.16 This position was confirmed at the hearing17, with special emphasis by the Claimants on their right to defend themselves against the Respondent's claim based on their alleged misrepresentations to the Tribunal, which should not be hindered by the Respondent's intention to hide behind the Confidentiality Agreement18.\n\nThe Claimants' letter dated 8 July 2016.\n\nTR-E, Day 1, p. 30/10-12; Day 2, p. 642/6-643/14, 665/21-666/4, 943/3-5.\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 660/12-662/6.\n\n74.\n\nBefore the hearing, the Respondent did not agree that its witnesses could testify without constraint in view of the Confidentiality Agreement.19 At the hearing, it accepted that the Claimants' Witness Goff could testify about the negotiations20 and released its own Witnesses from their confidentiality obligation21, retaining however Venezuela's obligation not to reveal documents22 relating to the negotiation as long as its Counsel were not authorized to produce any such document23. Contrary to the position of the Respondent's Counsel, Witness Mommer refused to testify about events occurring during the period covered by the Confidentiality Agreement24, with the exception of matters dealt with in the WikiLeaks cables25. While still invoking the Confidentiality Agreement26, Counsel's argument shifted to invoking a settlement privilege, which was, in the Respondent's view, the very purpose of this Agreement27. The Tribunal asked Counsel of the Respondent to confer with his client in this respect.28 The authorization was not provided during the Hearing.29\n\nThe Respondent's letter dated 8 July 2016.\n\nTR-E, Day 2, p. 643/19-644/1.\n\nTR-E, Day 2, p. 645/4-12. This was also the Tribunal's instruction (TR-E, Day 3, p. 946/19947/3, 947/14-22; Day 4, p. 1031/17-18).\n\nTR-E, Day 2, p. 639/8-12, 644/1-645/3,646/20-647/1. It was explained that Venezuela didn't want evidence of the specific parameters of the fair-market-value discussion to be used (p. 644/10-12).\n\nTR-E, Day 2, p. 647/11-13.\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 942/9-943/16, 947/4-948/7; Day 4, p. 1061/13-16, 1142/12-13, 1143/1-9.\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 942/19-943/1, 945/16-18, 946/2-3, 962/21-963/1. For Respondent's Counsel, what Witness Mommer could not do was to deliver documents, which he didn't have anyway (TR-E, Day 3, p. 946/3-4, 948/21-949/31). It was explained to the Witness that the subject matter of the coverage through the Confidentiality Agreement was dealt with in the WikiLeaks cables.\n\nThe point was raised \u2013 and not resolved \u2013 whether in light of the Claimants' alleged breach of the Confidentiality Agreement the Respondent was still bound by the commitments contained therein (TR-E, Day 2, p. 646/5-647/5; Day 3, p. 693/4-694/4). See also Article 1,168 of the Civil Code of Venezuela: \"En los contratos bilaterales, cada contratante puede negarse a ejecutar su obligaci\u00f3n si el otro no ejecuta la suya, a menos que se hayan fijado fechas diferentes para la ejecuci\u00f3n de las dos obligaciones.\"\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 656/14-657/12, 658/8-659/4, 663/19-22, 664/11-15.\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 655/15-656/2, 666/6-22, 790/14-21. The Tribunal had decided not to issue a decision on this matter before the hearing (ICSID letter of 12 July 2016).\n\nCf. statement of Counsel of the Respondent, TR-E, Day 3, p. 789/15-790/9; Day 5, p. 1451/11-12.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent ultimately agreed to submit some of the presentations that were used during the meetings of the negotiators between December 2007 and September 2008, and it did not object to the Claimants' acting in the same way. In its letter of 31 August 2016, the Respondent declared, however, that it maintained its objection based on Article 2 of the Confidentiality Agreement. The objection has been reiterated in the Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \"as a matter of principle\" (para. 24). The purpose of this objection is unclear, not explained and unconvincing. What should be the meaning of the objection in relation to the ten documents the Respondent accepted to submit, without being forced to do so? The Respondent does not answer the question whether Article 2 may still remain legally binding on its part when it admitted that the Claimants' were in breach of the obligations contained in the Agreement. The Respondent's presentations all relate to matters dealt with in the WikiLeaks cables in respect of which the Respondent expressly declared at the hearing that they were no longer covered by confidentiality. The Respondent invoked a settlement privilege (without further definition of its scope) when it claimed to be entitled to retain documents that were used during the negotiations, further explaining that specific parameters of fair-market-values should remain secret. However, it appears that the documents which the Respondent filed with the Tribunal do not contain such sensitive information on Venezuela's part, and if they did, they would have been revealed anyhow through the Claimants' filing of most of the same documents. Finally, the Respondent does not explain why and to what extent its objection based on the Confidentiality Agreement should be of any relevance to the Tribunal, or why the Tribunal should be concerned by the legal obligations contained therein and only agreed upon between the Parties.\n\nB. The Respondent's Position\n----------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent's first line of argument in respect of the negotiations on compensation consists of reverting to the Tribunal's evaluation of the relevant facts and the conclusion it reached in paragraph 404(d) of the 2013 Decision. The Respondent contends that valuations were made in 2006 and 2007 by both sides until the date when the taking became effective; these valuations were not fundamentally different from each other. ConocoPhil-lips' evaluation models in late 2006 were US$ 2.07 billion for the two Projects, an amount lower than what they report on the Respondent's offer made in early 2007 (cumulating at US$ 2.3 billion, not including the Corocoro Project). Therefore, it should be inferred from the positions of both parties at that time that there existed no serious dispute on the substance of the negotiation. The same remained true when considering the increase Venezuela offered in early August 2007 from US$ 2.3 to US$ 3.1 billion (according to Mr. Limbacher's letter dated 10 August 2007). Irrespective of whether the Respondent did submit proposals in line with fair market value, or not, it was never too far away from the Claimants' valuations. Therefore, the Tribunal should not have concluded that the Respondent was in breach of an obligation to negotiate in good faith on the basis of market value. The Respondent further observes that the Claimants never submitted in 2007 a valuation that could have been compared to the Respondent's offers. The Claimants had no meaningful response to a 2007 valuation presented by the Respondent's experts, which showed that the Parties' experts were remarkably close to each other.\n\n77.\n\nRelying on Witness Mommer, the Respondent asserts that Venezuela's proposals were realistic because they took account of the compensation formulas applicable to the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects, whereas ConocoPhillips totally disregarded the express limitations of liability provided for under the compensation provisions that had been negotiated at great length.\n\n78.\n\nThe second line of the Respondent's submissions begins with its assertion that the 2013 Decision was based on materially false representations of the Claimants and on an inference drawn by the Tribunal from a lack of evidence concerning the negotiations during a period that was covered by the Confidentiality Agreement. The Claimants cannot continue to escape the consequences of the misrepresentations that they made to this Tribunal and that led to the Majority's finding of bad faith negotiation, which in turn led to the Majority's ruling that the valuation date should be moved beyond the date of the nationalization to the date of the Award.\n\n79.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants' misrepresentations were: (1) The Claimants said in their memorials that the amount that the Respondent offered them in 2007 represented 5% of fair market value, thus indicating that their assets had a value of US$ 46 billion in 2007. (2) The Claimants stated at the 2010 Hearing that a fair market value would have been between 7 to 10 times the amount that was actually offered. That would have been around US$ 20 billion. (3) The Claimants said at the hearing and in the post-hearing skeleton that Venezuela never offered fair market value, even though ConocoPhillips' own executives, lead negotiator Goff and Mr. Lyons, reported exactly the opposite to the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, expressly acknowledging that the Republic was negotiating fair market value. (4) Dr. Mommer did not respond to the 12 April 2007 letter while in fact he did the next day. (5) The Claimants never denied these facts, which are irreconcilable with the representations they made at the 2010 Hearing.\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimants' main misrepresentation is the one affirming that \"Venezuela made it clear that it would not offer compensation based on Fair Market Value\". There was never any basis for that representation. The revelation of the U.S. Embassy cables removes any doubt in this respect. The two cables of 4 April and 23 May 2008 reflect the acknowledgment of the Claimants' lead negotiators that the Respondent was in fact negotiating fair market value. Neither Mr. Goff nor Mr. Lyons has ever denied that they said to the U.S. Embassy what was reported in the cables quoted by the Respondent in its prior submissions. Mr. Goff has not submitted any additional witness statement to refute the cables. The cables are obviously accurate in respect of the key issue before this Tribunal and demonstrate beyond doubt, argued the Respondent, that the Claimants did make material misrepresentations to the Tribunal on the question that the Majority of the Tribunal found to be of central importance, namely, whether the Respondent negotiated on the basis of fair market value.\n\n81.\n\nIf the Majority had understood that both sides were in fact bound by confidentiality commencing in November 2007 and if the Majority had understood that it was explained to the U.S. Embassy by the Claimants that the Respondent was negotiating on the basis of fair market value, would it still have found bad faith negotiation on the part of the Respondent? Of course not, says the Respondent.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimants' response is contained in a single paragraph of their Reply on Quantum where they say that the substance of the cable is not accurate and that Venezuela never made a fair market value offer. That is why Mr. Lyons states that he sees no reason to revise his prior testimony. The Claimants rely on a new witness statement of Mr. Lyons. But nowhere does he state that the cables were inaccurate or that the meetings did not take place.\n\n83.\n\nNext, says the Respondent, the Claimants argue that if it had made a formal, fair market value offer, it would have been submitted to the Tribunal. This says nothing about the accuracy of the cables. Despite the Claimants' assertion, there is no doubt that offers were made. The Tribunal has referred to the offer the Claimants say was made to them in early 2007.\n\n84.\n\nThe reality is that the Claimants do not contest the accuracy of the U.S. Embassy cables at all, argues the Respondent. If the Claimants had told the Tribunal what is now on the record, the Tribunal would not have found bad faith negotiations. Further, the entire evidence now before the Tribunal shows that book value was not the subject of the negotiations.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that there is ample precedent for the principle that a party should not be allowed to benefit from its own misconduct or wrongdoing. Other expressions are used, including the notion of good faith. It would be a clear violation of those principles to allow the Claimants in this *quantum* phase to take advantage of their own wrongful acts to increase compensation. Regardless of what was decided in the first phase of this proceeding, including the Majority's refusal to reconsider its 2013 Decision, this Tribunal unquestionably has the power to apply the universally legal principles referred to above in the *quantum* phase.\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants' misconduct and fraud must have the effect of denying the Claimants the relief they seek. More specifically, the Respondent asserts that the Tribunal should at this time exclude from the calculation of *quantum* of damages that portion that arises from moving the valuation date to the date of the Award due to the finding of bad faith and unlawful expropriation.\n\n87.\n\nWhat is important for the Respondent is that but for the Claimants' misrepresentations and their failure to correct the record, the Majority of this Tribunal would never have made its finding of bad faith negotiation, and without that finding, the Majority would have found the nationalization to be lawful, just as the *Mobil* ICSID tribunal did30. There would never have been a dispute about the valuation date being other than 26 June 2007. Therefore, the appropriate remedy for the Claimants' misrepresentations is to remove any benefit the Claimants would otherwise have obtained from a higher, post-nationalization valuation.\n\n*Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd.* et al. *v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID/ARB/07/27, Award dated 9 October 2014 (CL-348).\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent refers to a number of precedents where misconduct and fraud led to the dismissal of all claims, such as in *Azinian v. Mexico31*, *Libananco v. Turkey32* and other cases involving Turkey. It also mentions the unprecedented incident of Qatar's submission of forged documents in the case in *Qatar v. Bahrain33*. It is thus well recognized that wrongful conduct may be taken into account in determining the appropriate amount of damages that should be awarded. The Claimants must be prevented from receiving the benefit that would directly result from the wrong they have perpetrated.\n\n*Robert Azinian* et al. *v. The United Mexican States*, ICSID/ARB(AF)/97/2, Award dated 1 November 1999 (R-450).\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v.

Bahrain)*, Judgment dated 16 March 2001, ICJ Reports 40 (2001) (R-452).\n\nC. The Claimants' Position\n--------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimants recall that the Tribunal found that the expropriation was unlawful. It observed that Venezuela failed to make any good-faith offer of prompt, market value compensation at any of the relevant milestones, including the August 2006 term sheets promulgated by Venezuela for the forced migration, Venezuela's draft contracts of January 2007 for converting the three Projects into *empresas mixtas*, and Venezuela's verbal offers made at meetings on 29 and 31 March 2007, based on book value and referred to in the Claimants' letter responses of 12 April 2007. At no point during the eleven-month expropriation process did Venezuela pay fair market value compensation. It has not referred to any document evidencing any fair market value offer in the period leading up to the expropriation. The Tribunal further considered post-expropriation events, *i.e.* the Claimants' offer of 17 August 2007 (a variation of the 15 June offer), and public statements on on-going negotiations in February 2008, particularly Minister Ram\u00edrez' speech of 14 February 2008. In sum, the Tribunal conducted a detailed review of the evidentiary and testimonial record in reaching its conclusion that Venezuela violated Article 6(c) of the BIT.\n\n90.\n\nVenezuela made only one offer of compensation in the pre-expropriation period. Even after the expropriation, Venezuela's posture remained the same. The Claimants were compelled to commence this arbitration in November 2007; shortly thereafter (with effect from 27 November), the Confidentiality Agreement came into effect and the Parties commenced discussions \u2013 not about compensation for the expropriation \u2013 but rather about the settlement of the arbitration claims. Those discussions are entirely irrelevant to the issue of good faith negotiations for compensation for the expropriation. And three months into the settlement talks, Minister Ram\u00edrez was still saying that Venezuela would never pay market value.\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants note that since the Respondent requested reconsideration of the 2013 Decision, it argues that two WikiLeaks cables from April and May 2008 show that the Tribunal was wrong in finding that Venezuela did not negotiate in good faith and that this erroneous conclusion was the result of the Claimants' misrepresentations, when they never released information about the reports Messr. Goff and Lyons had made to the U.S. Embassy.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimants explain that these cables were never seen by them. They are based on double-hearsay and not admissible as evidence. The substance of the cables is not accurate. Venezuela never made a fair market value offer for the expropriated Projects. If a formal, fair market value offer for the three Projects had in fact been made, the Tribunal surely would have been presented with it by now. Venezuela has provided no document of the sort. The cables do not refer to any such document. Further, the cables refer to a method based on fair market value in relation to the first arbitration claim only. There is no basis for Venezuela's claims of error by the Tribunal or misrepresentations by the Claimants.\n\n93.\n\nAs to the allegations of misrepresentation, Venezuela relies on two documents that have nothing to do with whether the government ever offered fair market value. The WikiLeaks cables purport to describe discussions with respect to the settlement of the Claimants' arbitration claims. The truth is that Venezuela never made any offer of fair market value compensation, either at the legally relevant time, or indeed at any time.\n\nD. The Tribunal's Findings\n--------------------------\n\n*1. The negotiations before the filing of the Request for Arbitration*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent once again seeks to re-argue the evidence and the conclusions drawn by the Tribunal in its 2013 Decision. The Tribunal decided that the few proposals that were made by the Respondent and submitted to the Tribunal did not represent fair market valuations.\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent objects that its own valuations, made in a different scenario as explained below, were close or comparable to those of the Claimants. The Tribunal notes, however, that the simple fact that the figures or valuations from each side were not very different at the relevant time, in a first period in 2007, and for the relevant scenario, does not demonstrate, on its own, that the amounts arrived at represented market prices.\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that when the Respondent mentions the Claimants' own valuation in 2007, it refers to internal valuations prepared in 2006, at a time when no nationalization had yet been decreed. At that time, the Government had presented its offers to engage into a process of migration of foreign investments into state companies, *empresas mixtas*, where foreign investors were not admitted to hold more than a minority stake. As the 2013 Decision explains with many details (paras. 365-370)34, none of the proposals submitted by the Respondent for the purpose of such migration \u2013 in August 2006 and January 2007 \u2013 was based on compensation in any form other than through the acquisition of minority stakes in the state entities to be formed.\n\nSee also Witness Mommer, TR-E, Day 3, p. 973/18-991/19.\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal does not need to explain that a valuation for the purpose of migration in the form of a minority holding into a state entity represents amounts considerably different from those resulting from a valuation of the interests an investor was holding in companies controlled by a majority of foreign investors and protected through an investment treaty and a mechanism of international arbitration. In the Respondent's own and correct admission, migration was different from expropriation. It did not trigger a valuation on the basis of market values as this applies in the case of an expropriation or nationalization. The financial components of a migration into *empresas mixtas* subject to state holding were not reflecting the same market values, as were the elements put on a market open to any buyer willing to acquire the rights contained in the Association Agreements. In particular, loss of profit arising from these Agreements over their remaining life-time was not an issue in case of migration; such profit was simply substituted by the profit resulting from the operation of the *empresas mixtas* (including the improvements such as the New Areas).\n\n98.\n\nThe situation changed significantly when Decree-Law No. 5,200 on nationalization was enacted on 26 February 2007. From that day on, ConocoPhillips was threatened by a complete taking of all of its assets if it were still opposing its migration as a minority stakeholder into a company controlled by a state holding of 60%. This had of course consequences on the approach the investors took in respect of the compensation of their interests. There was no longer any point in comparing compensation for the forthcoming nationalization of the totality of ConocoPhillips' assets to the valuations made for the very different purpose of migration of ConocoPhillips' interests as minority stake in state companies.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent contends that when it was faced with this perspective of having to provide compensation of ConocoPhillips' interests as a consequence of the nationalization, it did in fact negotiate on the basis of fair market valuations, contrary to what the Tribunal's Majority concluded in the 2013 Decision.\n\n100.\n\nThe Respondent was aware that ConocoPhillips wanted to be provided with appropriate compensation. This was the reason it submitted two verbal compensation proposals at a meeting held on 29 March 2007. The total amount put forward in case of ConocoPhillips' withdrawal from Venezuela was US$ 2.3 billion, which, in the Respondent's submission, was not far removed from ConocoPhillips' own internal valuations. The proposal consisted of two variants, for each of the two main projects (no offer being made yet for Corocoro). The first variant offered a certain percentage of participation through migration into the state company holding the assets in the future (covering a larger surface, thus providing additional profits), which was 22.85% for Hamaca and 40% for Petrozuata, these shareholdings being accompanied by a payment of US$ 350 million in the case of Hamaca and of US$ 100 million for Petrozuata. The second variant offered no migration, providing for the complete exit of ConocoPhillips for the amount of US$ 1.2 billion for Hamaca, and US$ 1.1 billion for Petrozuata; both amounts totaling US$ 2.3 billion, which is often referred to by the Respondent as evidence of Venezuela's intention to evaluate ConocoPhil-lips' interests at fair market levels. For Witness Mommer, the two cash payments of 350 and 100 million were supposed to represent book values35, whereas the amount of US$ 2.3 billion was a reasonable first estimate of the fair market value of ConocoPhillips' assets, as Venezuela understood it36. When looking at the presentations submitted during the negotiations in 2008, it appears highly unlikely to this Tribunal that this second assertion is correct. As the Claimants rightly observe, the amount of 2.3 billion comes very close to the amount of 2,283 billion recorded in a presentation bearing the date of December 2007 and identified as representing the book value of the three Projects, including Corocoro.37\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 1002/13-14, 1003/9-11.\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 1004/4-13.\n\nCf. the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 41, 50, referring to C-695-697. The most relevant slide is contained in the presentation under C-695 (page 2) and copied in most parts in the Claimants' Brief on page 13 (however wrongly attributed to C-697).\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent did not provide evidence as to the components of such market valuations. The Respondent did not disclose either the proposal itself, which has been merely referred to in the Claimants' letters of 12 April 2007, signed by Mr. Lyons. These letters conveyed ConocoPhillips' understanding that Venezuela would not compensate them for fair market values. They set out ConocoPhillips' refusal to accept Venezuela's proposals, further noting that they were premised on the waiver by ConocoPhillips of its rights to seek compensation through other legal means, including international arbitration. The amounts submitted by Venezuela seemed to reflect a cash payment in exchange for ConocoPhillips' exit from the migration process rather than a compensation for an expropriation that at that time was not yet enforced. These three letters were not well received by Venezuela, causing Vice-Minister Mommer the following day to complain strongly about ConocoPhillips' attitude and to reject anything that they suggested. For Witness Mommer, the 12 April letters in no way reflected the results of the meeting they had on 29 March 2007.38 In his letter of 13 April 200739, no offer whatsoever was retained for the purpose of negotiation.\n\nTR-E, Day 4, p. 1044/3-19, 1045/14-1048/17, 1175/3-1176/12.\n\nR-313, Annex 2.\n\n102.\n\nThe following months, meetings were held, but no further offer was made by the Respondent, with the effect that at the date of the taking on 26 June 2007, the expropriation was enforced with no compensation either paid or offered by Venezuela. Minister Ram\u00edrez stated in his speech on the same day that they \"have talked about continuing negotiations in order to establish pertinent agreements\".40\n\nC-249. Cf. Witness Mommer, Third Supplemental Direct Testimony of 7 January 2015, para. 5, and TR-E, Day 4, p. 1187/3-15, confirming that contacts and discussions on negotiations continued.\n\n103.\n\nConocoPhillips then tried to reach agreement upon an asset trade involving refineries owned by Venezuela in the United States. Two offers were made, dated 15 June and 17 August 200741, the second one arriving at a net value of US$ 6.7 billion42. In between these two offers, Venezuela made an offer of US$ 4 billion.43 Neither offer was accepted. As from that time, the parties were reported to be billions of dollars apart.44 Minister Ram\u00edrez expressed another view.45\n\nCf. Appendix 4 and 5 to Witness Mommer's Direct Testimony of 24 July 2009.\n\nCf. Witness Mommer, Direct Testimony of 24 July 2009, para. 22. For Witness Goff, the valuation for the Citgo Company was probably closer to US$ 10 billion (TR-E, Day 2, p. 616/8-19), a number that had been communicated to Venezuela's team during the negotiations in 2008 (TR-E, Day 2, p. 617/16-618/6, 624/8-625/7).\n\nAt the August 2016 Hearing, Witness Mommer referred in this respect to the Request for Arbitration, \u00a7 98 (TR-E, Day 4, p.1052/7-9, 1060/9-10). The proposal also contained an asset swap (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1060/9-1061/12). Without providing any detail, Witness Lyons refers to the same proposal in the U.S. cable dated 26 July 2007 (C-679) and at the August 2016 Hearing (TR-E, Day 3, p. 675/17-21, 689/9-690/6), noting that he was not knowledgeable about it. Witness Goff noted that he may have seen this 4 billion figure but he was unable to specifically remember (TR-E, Day 2, p. 565/17-567/7). The Claimants note that the offer of US$ 4 billion should be compared to the annual additional revenue of US$ 5.8 billion per year that President Ch\u00e1vez announced as the revenue that was in large part produced from projects taken from ConocoPhillips (cf. Request for Arbitration, \u00a7 98; Claimants' Memorial of 15 September 2008, para. 237).\n\nCf. Mr. Lyons' report to the U.S. Embassy, cable dated 22 August 2007 (C-680).\n\nWhen he met the President of the Commission on Energy and Mines of the National Assembly on 29 August 2007, he told him that negotiations continued with ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil and asserted \"that he will soon finalize negotiations with Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips oil companies\" (C-362).\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants stated that Venezuela's proposal of a pay-out of US$ 2.3 billion represented not more than 5% of the total real value of its interests, which would translate into a value of US$ 46 billion. The Respondent refers to this amount as one of the grossly overstated misrepresentations made by the Claimants to the Tribunal. Witness Goff thought that such amount was not realistic.46 In fact, such amount had not been invoked during the negotiations in 2007 or later. It was mentioned for the first time in the Claimants' Memorial of 15 September 2008 (para. 309, p. 159). When considering the events in preparing its 2013 Decision, the Tribunal, taking note of the Claimants' statement (para. 390), was certainly aware that this amount was overstated, given the fact that in the same Memorial, the Claimants evaluated their total loss at US$ 20,468 billion, together with a gross-up related to U.S. taxes of US$ 9,836 billion.\n\nTR-E, Day 2, p. 494/22-495/10, 550/12-18.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimants themselves did not retain such amount for their own estimates during the negotiations; they considered their assets to be worth around US$ 20 billion, as stated in Mr. Limbacher's letter of August 10, 200747 and confirmed by Mr. Mulva, CEO of ConocoPhillips, when meeting the U.S. Embassy on 31 October 2007.48 Mr. Lyons added at the August 2016 Hearing that Mr. Limbacher mentioned the US$ 20 billion claim already before 26 June 200749, but that he stated also that ConocoPhillips was prepared to accept a much lower value in order to reach an agreement50. For ConocoPhillips, as explained by Mr. Limbacher, Executive Vice-President, Venezuela's own valuation was below \"by a factor of six or seven\"51, which comes close to the amended offer of US$ 3.1 billion made by Venezuela at a meeting of 2 August 2007 and mentioned in Mr. Limbacher's letter of 10 August 200752.\n\nR-653.\n\nCable of 31 October 2007 (C-682). At the August 2016 Hearing, the Claimants used yet another comparison to show the discrepancy between their figures and Venezuela's offer of 2.3 billion. In their submission, the Projects Petrozuata and Hamaca were generating US$ 7.3 billion per year; half of that income stream minus costs and taxes belonged to ConocoPhillips, resulting in an earning of US$ 14 billion inclusive of interest for the past nine years, not counting the further amount representing the two decades of the remaining duration of the expropriated rights in each of the three Projects (cf. TR-E, Day 1, p. 11/12-22, 12/3-6, 49/1-6).\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 713/1-4, 18-19, 717/14-15.\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 700/16-19.\n\nCable dated 12 September 2007 (C-681).\n\nSee also Witness Lyons (TR-E, Day 3, p. 676/18-19, 678/7-680/15), explaining that what is called an offer in Mr. Limbacher's letter was in fact rather a cursory statement made by Mr. Del Pino at a meeting on 2 August 2007. Witness Mommer said that the offer referred to in the letter was correct (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1173/2-5) but that he did not recall that his team had been consulted (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1095/3-1096/15).\n\n106.\n\nIn the minds of those involved in estimating what would become a just compensation for Venezuela's taking of ConocoPhillips' assets, any view on what would represent a fair market value must have been approximate. The figures put forward by ConocoPhillips' representatives may have been considered high or excessive. Nevertheless, Cono coPhillips was entitled to react to the nationalization of its assets in defense of its own interests and to present its claim for compensation. Venezuela had no meaningful reply to ConocoPhillips' proposals and valuations. Its position remained focused on the amounts proposed in connection with the migration into *empresas mixtas*, without considering the different context in which the matter of compensation was to be approached as a consequence of the nationalization of the totality of ConocoPhillips' assets.53 The focus was thus on a rigid asset valuation, no consideration being given to market prices covering Cono-coPhillips' assets and profits as a whole.54\n\nThus, Witness Mommer said that he reacted with disbelief in respect of the US$ 20 billion estimate of fair market value mentioned in Mr. Limbacher's letter of 10 August 2017, explaining that the proposal was absurd in comparison to the sums that were paid to all the companies with which Venezuela reached agreement (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1177/4-1178/7). His testimony relates to the agreements on migration to *empresas mixtas* exclusively.\n\nRelying on the Congressional Authorizations, the Respondent's view was that \"the restructuring into mixed companies were not compensable actions\" (Counter-Memorial of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela dated 27 July 2009, para. 278).\n\n107.\n\nIt was thus no surprise when the Venezuelan official Mr. Del Pino declared to the press on 28 September 2007 that PdVSA will only pay book value for the confiscated assets.55 It is true that the concept of book value as used by the Parties in this case is imprecise as such may be even more than the notion of fair market value. However, in the circumstances of the instant case, fair market value included, contrary to book value or any similar concept, estimations about the evolution of oil prices in the coming years. These estimates had undoubtedly the potential of leading to higher amounts, which became evident later on. Venezuela's proposals were set at a clearly lower level than amounts based on fair market values (including profits emerging during the future life-time of the projects)\n\nC-685. The Respondent recalled at the August 2016 Hearing that for Venezuela, book value was about US$ 1.8 billion (TR-E, Day 1, p. 109/3-4, 135/1-3; Day 3, p. 685/18-19). When referring to internal Cono-coPhillips valuations retained in October 2006 for the Business Plan for Petrozuata and Hamaca, it identified a net present value of 3,011.64 billion, less a debt of 774 million, which brings the overall amount down to approximately 2,237 billion (cf. TR-E, Day 2, p. 539/6-548/11; Day 3, p. 720/7-722/7, referring to C-474 and LECG Exhibit 129). While he accepted these figures, Mr. Lyons noted that the underlying calculations served to verify whether the operating companies would be able to meet their cash obligations. He strongly opposed the idea that they were to be used for net present value calculations or any other business purpose, all the more so as the document did not include oil price increases (TR-E, Day 3, p. 722/18-725/2). Witness Sheet explained that these were reserve calculations that had to be based on fixed prices and have nothing to do with a fair-market-type valuation (TR-E, Day 3, p. 827/10-830/22). He added that discount rates are irrelevant to a reserve calculation (TR-E, Day 3, p. 843/14-844/8).\n\n108.\n\nThe Respondent argues \u2013 based on a press release \u2013 that Mr. Lowe, Executive VicePresident of ConocoPhillips, told an investment conference on 5 September 2007 that Venezuela had agreed to pay fair market value compensation for a crude-oil project ConocoPhillips abandoned earlier the same year.56 However, as the Claimants rightly observed57, the same press report notes Minister Ram\u00edrez' recent position that Venezuela will recognize book value, not the net present value, as also stated by Mr. Del Pino at the end of the same month. A week after the Conference, Mr. Limbacher reported to the U.S. Embassy that Venezuela has not been flexible in its negotiating position.58\n\nDow Jones Newsletters, 5 September 2007 (R-602; cf. TR-E, Day 1, p. 155/8-156/19).\n\nTR-E, Day 1, p. 60/8-61/17.\n\nCable dated 12 September 2007 (C-681).\n\n109.\n\nWitness Mommer objected to the use of the term book value, testifying that he and his team had never referred to such concept, but that they were considering market values.59 Book value, he said, was ConocoPhillips' language; whatever was not their market value, they called it book value.60 However, he had little more than simple denials to express when confronted with the use of the term book value in the press report on Mr. Del Pino's statement or in Minister Ram\u00edrez' speech of 14 February 2008.61 The evidence before the Tribunal shows that the term book value had been used as conveying a meaning similar to Venezuela's frequently expressed position that it will object to any compensation based on fair market values as they were determined by the Claimants. This understanding must also be retained when reading the Tribunal's 2013 Decision (para. 400).\n\nCf., in relation to his 13 April letter in response to the three letters of 12 April 2007, TR-E, Day 4, p. 1048/3-13.\n\nTR-E, Day 4, p. 1111/2-1112/4, 1134/21-1135/19, 1144/14-1146/1, 1197/9-17, 1200/1-22.\n\nC-190. Cf. TR-E, Day 4, p. 1112/9-1114/20, 1115/11-1116/4, 1122/18-1128/19, 1136/5-1137/11, 1146/2-8.\n\n110.\n\nThe shift from an asset analysis \u2013 used for the purposes of migration \u2013 to market value in the context of nationalization seems not to have retained the attention of Venezuela's representatives. The Government of Venezuela was not subject to particular constraints when fixing the conditions for migrations into *empresas mixtas* ; under the circumstances, the foreign investors' bargaining power was limited. The situation was different however once the consequences of the nationalization had to be evaluated. In this respect, compensation had to be \"prompt, fair and adequate\" as required by Article 11(1) of the Investment Law. The legal situation is similar on the basis of Article 6(c) of the BIT, where \"market value\" is mentioned explicitly.\n\n111.\n\nOne would have expected that this difference in the level of valuating compensation for nationalization, compared to a migration into state companies, would be reflected in the negotiations and discussions ongoing in 2007. On ConocoPhillips' side, the effect must have been that higher amounts based on market values including forthcoming oil price increases could be requested. This was the consequence of the fact that unlike migration, the expropriation of ConocoPhillips' assets brought into effect the protection provisions of Article 6 of the BIT. Migration, as it was proposed to ConocoPhillips in 2007, included the termination of the Association Agreements with no compensation and a waiver of international arbitration. Expropriation necessarily triggered compensation for the value of the assets and the profit resulting from the Agreement's operation over the whole of their remaining life-time, combined with arbitration as a procedural safeguard. Both approaches \u2013 migration and termination through expropriation \u2013 yielded economic values of very distinct dimensions, even if both were relying on market references.\n\n112.\n\nOn Venezuela's side, the insistence on book value or similar value-levels had a short-term future in light of a possible claim submitted to international arbitration, either based on the Investment Law, or the BIT, or both. The filing of such a claim was announced to Venezuela for the first time as early as in the trigger letters of January 31, 2007, causing no reaction on Venezuela's part.62 The evidence before this Tribunal does not show that Venezuela was considering a need to shift towards fair market valuations in light of the pertinent legal requirements.63 When Witness Mommer was asked whether he had been taking account of the Investment Law and in particular of its requirement for \"prompt, fair and adequate compensation\", he answered that this Law never played a role for him.64 In the same vein, he also must have disregarded the requirement for \"just compensation\" representing \"market value\" in Article 6(c) of the BIT65; as he explained, he became seriously aware of a forthcoming ICSID proceeding when he heard it from Mr. Mulva at the meeting with Minister Ram\u00edrez on 29 October 2007.66\n\nCf. 2013 Decision, paras. 384, 393.\n\nIn the terms of Witness Bou\u00e9: \"\u2026 we thought, well, nationalization happened on date X, so why does it matter what happens afterward?\" (TR-E, Day 3, p. 883/7-9).\n\nTR-E, Day 4, p. 1195/4-5, 1196/7-1197/9.\n\n\"I never thought about ICSID at first because, according to the Association Agreement, who had to pay compensation was PdV and not the Government.\" (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1098/19-22). He thought that the dispute was about a contract claim to be submitted to ICC Arbitration, with the effect that any indemnity ultimately would have to be paid by Maraven/PdV and not the Government (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1099/4-1101/2).\n\nTR-E, Day 4, p. 1118/18-22, 1120/10-18, 1193/12-1194/2. See also Witness Bou\u00e9, Supplemental Direct Testimony of 7 January 2015 (paras. 4-5).\n\n113.\n\nIn sum, as explained in the Tribunal's 2013 Decision (paras. 388-398), up to the time of the filing of the Claimants' Request for Arbitration, the Respondent did not envisage, conduct or propose to ConocoPhillips a market valuation as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT. It did not make any offer based upon such valuation. Witness Mommer's confirmed that there was no written offer made by Venezuela before the day when the Confidentiality Agreement became effective.67\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 941/20-942/10.\n\n114.\n\nHowever, the Respondent submits that its approach to the issue of compensation changed in the period following the initiation of the present arbitral proceeding, when a new round of negotiations was undertaken, which the Tribunal allegedly omitted to consider in its 2013 Decision and refused to reconsider as requested by the Respondent's Application for Reconsideration.\n\n*2. The negotiations after the filing of the Request for Arbitration*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Respondent draws the Tribunal's attention to the fact that the Claimants' own witnesses in this case, lead negotiator Mr. Goff and Mr. Lyons, reported to the U.S. Embassy in Caracas that Venezuela's representatives were negotiating fair market value, as stated in a cable from the Embassy dated 4 April 200868. According to another cable of 23 May 2008, Mr. Goff explained that it was ConocoPhillips who was insisting on receiving compensation more than, or on top of fair market value, while expressly acknowledging that the Republic was negotiating fair market value69.\n\nR-313, Annex 4.\n\nR-313, Annex 5.\n\n116.\n\nIf this information was correct, it would be part of a negotiation phase that was covered by the Confidentiality Agreement that was in effect since 27 November 2007. The report before the U.S. Embassy was thus relating to a series of facts that the Tribunal did not have as evidence in the record when preparing its 2013 Decision, and this with the agreement of all Parties, including the Party that is now accusing the Claimants of not releasing information it itself did not want to be revealed to the Tribunal.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent's understanding of the cable of 4 April 2008, where its representatives are allegedly reported as having agreed upon fair market valuations, is not fully accurate when compared to the text of the report, which reads, in relevant parts, as follows:\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\u00a71 \u2026 CP [ConocoPhillips] and BRV [Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela] have reached agreement on the methodology for determining fair market value of CP's assets. High oil prices will increase the amount of CP's compensation claims. \u2026\n\nNEGOTIATIONS ARE PROGRESSING\n\n\u00a72 \u2026 Goff began the meeting by stating he was a \"little optimistic\". He said May was the \"crunch time\" for the negotiations. CP would like to do a trade for Citgo assets if possible and negotiations have been moving in that direction. PDVSA claims it has enough cash on hand to pay off CP's claims but CP has its doubts.\n\n\u00a73 Goff explained that May is the key date for CP due to the fact that it has to submit is [ *recte* : its] official claims to the arbitration panel in June. CP's claims run in the tens of billions of dollars. Lyons noted that the claims have increased recently due to recent increases in oil prices.\n\n\u00a74 According to Goff, CP has two basic claims: a claim for compensation for its expropriated assets and a claim based on the progressive expropriation of the underlying assets. Goff stated the BRV has accepted that fair market value is the standard for the first claim. He said the BRV has moved away from using book value as the standard for compensation and has agreed on a fair market methodology with discount rates for computing the compensation for the expropriated assets. However, given the recent increases in oil prices, the fair market value of the assets has increased.\n\n\u00a75 As for the claim based on the progressive expropriation of the assets, Goff said the claim was on top of the fair market value of the assets. CP has proposed a settlement number and the BRV appears to be open to it. Goff added that CP also plans on increasing the settlement number for the second claim due to recent increases in oil prices.\n\nThe report made to the U.S. Embassy notes in paragraphs 1 and 4 that Venezuela had accepted fair market value as the standard for ConocoPhillips' first claim, which relates to the expropriated assets.70 However, ConocoPhillips had a second claim, based on the \"progressive expropriation of the underlying assets\", as stated in paragraph 4. The report does not explain this expression.71 It notes in paragraph 5, nonetheless, that this claim was \"on top of the fair market value of the assets\", which seems to indicate that this second claim was on an amount comparable to the market value of the assets, *i.e.* the first claim. In this respect, however, the report does not provide any information about the methodology applied, nor does it indicate that Venezuela did agree to fair market methodology as it did in respect of the first claim. Witness Goff told the Tribunal that he did not make such a \"second\" claim.72 The report does not go further than stating that ConocoPhillips had proposed a \"settlement number\" and that Venezuela appeared \"to be open to it\". Thus, the report does not provide evidence for an agreement by Venezuela to fair market valuation in respect of the second claim.\n\nFor Witness Goff, there was an understanding around fair market value to begin discussions (TR-E, Day 2, p. 502/14-16, 522/5-17, 616/1-7, 632/11-20). When asked again on the topic, he did not remember whether the framework on which the discussions were based did include the term fair market value (TR-E, Day 2, p. 632/21-633/15). In fact, the copy supplied to the Tribunal does not contain this expression (C-688). Witness Lyons confirmed that the sentence on the standard of compensation for the first claim was correct (TR-E, Day 3, p. 702/13-21). Some of the presentations used during the negotiations recorded expressly that the discussions centered upon a fair-market-value approach to valuation (C-693, C- 694).\n\nWitness Lyons observed that the second claim was relevant for the filing of arbitration and related to the fiscal changes that occurred in June or October 2004 through June 2007 (TR-E, Day 3, p. 696/6-13, 700/8-9).\n\nTR-E, Day 2, p. 512/10-19.\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent relies heavily on this 4 April 2008 cable when asserting that Venezuela was negotiating on the basis of fair market value. The Respondent notes that the Claimants do not object to the accuracy of the cables, which is demonstrated by Witness Lyons' silence in this respect.73\n\n\"Nothing that I have read causes me to reconsider or amend my prior testimony regarding the negotiations or Venezuela's position in them.\" (Fifth Witness Statement of 13 October 2014, para. 14).\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that none of the witnesses had stated or explained at the hearing that the content of the U.S. Embassy cables was not accurate or unreliable, as argued by the Claimants. It is equally clear that the Claimants are wrong in considering that the cables reported about settlement discussions that had nothing to do with negotiations; there is no doubt that the Parties tried to negotiate compensation with the effect that a successful negotiation would have settled the arbitration. The Claimants' arguments on the lack of any relevance of the cables have no merit.\n\n120.\n\nHowever, Mr. Goff \u2013 the Claimants' Witness \u2013 provided an explanation that has to be considered. He recalled that the briefings consisted generally in just responding to the questions the Embassy had, by way of a very general conversation.74 He was never told that what they talked about would be written down or recorded.75 As the excerpt quoted above shows, the cable is not always easy to understand.76 It is certainly not as clear as the Respondent argues it is. While Venezuela is said to accept fair market methodology, the 4 April 2008 cable also says that this observation does not apply to the totality of Cono-coPhillips' claims. Finally, while the report states that Venezuela was prepared to \"be open\" to consider a settlement number, it does not refer to any proposal or offer actually made on Venezuela's behalf.\n\nTR-E, Day 2, p. 496/19-497/2, 498/11-13, 501/4-8, 512/4-8. See also Witness Lyons, TR-E, Day 3, p. 750/8-15.\n\nTR-E, Day 2, p. 555/1-3.\n\nWitness Goff noted that for part of paragraph 5 (quoted above), he could not tell what it means (TR-E, Day 2, p. 511/16-512/9, 515/1-6.\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent relies not only on the cable of 4 April 2008, but also on a further cable dated 23 May 2008. The Respondent notes correctly that this second cable shows optimism on the part of Mr. Lyons.77 It does not sound like bad faith negotiation.78 Nonetheless, the cable does not report on any offer submitted by Venezuela, nor does it inform the U.S. Embassy that Venezuela was negotiating on the basis of fair market values.\n\nThe Claimants further explain that this optimism reflected an interest Venezuela's negotiators showed in respect of the results of an analysis performed by Mr. Goff and his team of the Citgo assets in the United States, and presented shortly before, at a meeting of 20 May 2008 (C-692); such positive reaction was thus exclusively related to the valuation of Venezuela's own assets (cf. TR-E, Day 1, p. 64/15-65/5). Witness Lyons considered the meeting to be very positive (TR-E, Day 3, p. 736/17).\n\nWitness Goff noted that the negotiation teams had \u00ab friendly discussions \u00bb (TR-E, Day 2, p. 531/1-2). The presentation of the Citgo valuation noted expressly that the team from Citgo was very responsive and willing to work with ConocoPhillips during the process.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that neither one of these two cables, nor any other, include evidence that Venezuela had submitted any concrete offer based on fair market value. The Respondent affirms that there is no doubt that offers were made, and it refers in support of this contention to the offers the Claimants received in early 2007.79 The Respondent misses the point. The offers made in early 2007 were made prior to the nationalization; they were irrelevant in terms of the fair market valuation of all of ConocoPhillips' assets subject to Decree No. 5,200. The Respondent does not supply any document or any other evidence in support of an allegation that an offer based on fair market values was submitted after November 2007. This has nothing to do with the accuracy of the U.S. Embassy cables. It is the simple fact that no offer on the part of Venezuela is reported or even mentioned in these cables. Respondent's Witness Mommer explained to the Tribunal that for Venezuela, the differences between the Parties were so fundamental that the negotiations did not reach the point to make a written offer; thus, Venezuela had not made any written offer at any time.80 The Claimants' Witness Goff recalled that during the entire period of his involvement in the negotiations, he never received a written or oral offer from Venezuela.81 Venezuela, as will be analyzed below, could not make a binding offer if not in writing.\n\nThe Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum of 7 January 2015, para. 314; 2010 Hearing, TR-E, Day 14, 3977/14-22.\n\nCf. TR-E, Day 3, p. 949/8-950/7, 951/8-13, 955/10, 971/13-21; Day 4, p. 1053/2-6. At one moment during the August 2016 Hearing Witness Mommer asserted that Venezuela did make offers during the confidentiality period (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1061/22-1063/3, 19-20). As no document was provided or referred to, he may have confused offers and presentations. When he was taken thereafter through all of his statements he came to admit that none of them described or evidenced any offer made by Venezuela during that period of the negotiations (cf. TR-E, Day 4, p. 1070/19-1077/12). And after having stated that Venezuela made an offer at the last meeting on 4 September 2008 (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1140/13-1144/2), he finally told the Tribunal that a presentation had been made, not confirming that it included an offer (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1202/20-1204/14). The Respondent's filing of presentations on 31 August 2016 did not contain information in this respect.\n\nTR-E, Day 2, p. 602/18-603/1. The Respondent is correct in stating that there is no requirement that compensation offers must be memorialized in writing and that they must not be declared as binding (Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17). Nonetheless, a proposal submitted in writing is usually more precise and easier to understand if provided with elements about the underlying calculations, whereas a purely oral communication has a more uncertain character in respect of its content and by the simple fact that its author declines to have it recorded. In any event, the Respondent's argument is mistaken: the Government of Venezuela was not authorized to make any monetary commitment without formalizing it in writing (cf. Witness Mommer, TR-E, Day 3, p. 971/22-972/5).\n\n123.\n\nSimilar conclusions must be drawn from the latest available cable dated 5 September 2008, where Mr. Lyons reported to the U.S. Embassy that following a meeting held the day before with the Venezuelan Government's negotiating team, negotiations on compensation for ConocoPhillips' expropriated assets had broken down and no future meeting dates had been set.82 The Venezuelan negotiating team returned to its original position that Venezuela will only pay book value for the assets. Mr. Lyons explained that throughout the negotiations, Venezuela had agreed to the use of a net present value calculation for the market value of the assets as stipulated in Venezuela's investment law and the Dutch Bilateral Investment Treaty.83 But now, Venezuela rejected such a calculation and it also refused to consider the possibility of a swap for Citgo's assets in the United States which were potentially of greater value to ConocoPhillips than for Venezuela. Again, this cable does not go any further than noting that, throughout the negotiations, Venezuela was prepared to envisage market values.84 But, there is no evidence of any concrete proposal or offer on that basis on the Respondent's part.\n\nVenezuela's position must have been affected by a sudden event. Few days ago, in a press report of 1st September 2008, Minister Ram\u00edrez was told to be hoping to reach an agreement with ConocoPhillips before a call for participation in three areas in the Carabobo Block of the Orinico Belt will be made in October (El Universal, C-364).\n\nSee also Witness Lyons, TR-E, Day 3, p. 771/3-772/12.\n\nWitness Goff did not remember that the Venezuelan negotiating team declared that only book value will be paid and that they rejected fair market values (TR-E, Day 2, p. 628/14-629/14). Witness Mommer told the Tribunal that this was consistent with his own testimony (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1153/7-1155/22). Witness Bou\u00e9 confirmed that Dr. Mommer had explained at the 4 September meeting that they were considering fair market value, also taking account of the compensation formulas (TR-E, Day 3, p. 888/18-22).\n\n124.\n\nIn an earlier cable, dated 7 August 2008, Mr. Goff was reported as having stated that Venezuela's assessment of the value of ConocoPhillips' (CP) expropriated assets \"continues to be substantially different than that of CP\". This difference was exacerbated by the fact that oil prices had more than doubled since the nationalization. Mr. Goff opined that Venezuela would likely be willing to pay cash if ConocoPhillips accepted Venezuela's valuation, but this would significantly undervalue the assets. Once again, the Tribunal notes that the cable does not allow recognizing whether an offer has been submitted to Cono-coPhillips or the basis for any such offer.\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal has not received any evidence about the precise impact of Minister Ram\u00edrez' statement in a speech before the National Assembly on 14 February 2008, when he declared, referring to the companies that had left the country, that the Republic \"should indemnify the book value of those assets\".85 He also said that he agreed with Mr. Mulva, the Global CEO of ConocoPhillips, in a speech on 12 February 200886 that \"we are on our way to reaching an agreement\". For Witness Mommer, it was obviously a political speech, directed much more towards the dispute with Exxon than the negotiations with Cono-coPhillips.87 It would seem however that Venezuela's negotiators could not ignore such declaration.88\n\nC-190. The relevant words in the Spanish original text are: \"\u2026 pero, por supuesto, indemnizar el valor en libros de esos activos, \u2026\".\n\nReuters UK, 12 February 2008 (R-117).\n\nCf. TR-E, Day 4, p. 1126/5-1128/4, 1146/2-8, 1185/13-1186/9; 2010 Hearing, TR-E, Day 7, p. 1804/7-8.\n\nWitness Mommer remained not impressed: \"I just continued working.\" (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1128/18), further recalling that he had clear instructions to reach an agreement based on market value (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1127/2-3, 1128/4-7).\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the presentations made by and to the teams conducting the negotiations after November 2007 do not offer more evidence in this respect. Most of the presentations that were submitted to the Tribunal on 31 August 2016 originated from the Claimants. They contain extensive information about valuations that were discussed during the meetings held prior to August 2008. However, they do not record any evidence of an amount of compensation that could be awarded, or at least provide directions that would allow the indication of such result with reasonable clarity. As Witness Goff explained to the Tribunal, \"we never agreed on a specific value\".89 He said that they had multiple valuations, but the discussion was not targeted to get a specific number.\"90 This is due in large part to the fact that the focus was at that time again on an asset swap involving various assets of Venezuela in the United States (mostly belonging to Citgo91). This had indeed been a priority for ConocoPhillips' negotiators, as stated expressly in the two reports made to the U.S. Embassy on 4 April and 23 May 2008 that have been mentioned above. Pursuant to another cable, dated 7 August 200892, Venezuela finally declared that it preferred an \"auction type approach\" in order to establish the right asset value, before turning down the idea all together.93\n\nHe added: \"There was never a specific value that we tried to get to. It was a range of values.\" (TR-E, Day 2, p. 513/16-18) \"It was somewhat of an abstract negotiation because it wasn't exchanging values.\" (TR-E, Day 2, p. 619/4-6) \"We never exchanged views.\" (TR-E, Day 2, p. 636/17)\n\nTR-E, Day 2, p. 514/4-9, 556/4-9. The Witness further noted that there was no discussion of any terms or anything like that (TR-E, Day 2, p. 530/16). When pressed to be more specific, he said that while he could not remember values ten years after the events, the values were in excess of US$ 10 billion (TR-E, Day 2, p. 557/5-11, 20-22). Witness Lyons mentioned figures as 8 or 9 billion (TR-E, Day 3, p. 735/5-7). Witness Goff also confirmed that in the discussions they never had an exact number that they talked about. They never said what the assets were worth. He did not know the Venezuelan number. They never said it's only book value. Cf. TR-E, Day 2, p. 574/18-577/1, 589/7-15, 594/15-16, 595/12-13. The communication of the approximate value of the Citco companies appears to be an exception (cf. TR-E, Day 2, p. 616/8-19, 617/16-618/6); however, Venezuela did not respond specifically (TR-E, Day 2, p. 624/8-625/7), as Witness Lyons also mentioned (TR-E, Day 3, p. 706/9-11).\n\nThe most valuable asset of Citgo was the refinery in Lake Charles, counting for 70 or 80 percent of the overall Citgo value (cf. Witness Sheet, TR-E, Day 3, p. 797/14-19, 799/2-8).\n\nC-683.\n\nSee also Witness Lyons, TR-E, Day 3, p. 769/3-22.\n\n127.\n\nIn these circumstances, any valuation covering all of ConocoPhillips' assets as if they were put on the free market must have been considered as of secondary importance and thus not representing a primary incentive for a productive exchange of offers on amounts to be paid in the hypothesis of all of ConocoPhillips' assets being put on an open market. Thus, the evidence before the Tribunal is that, in respect of either one of these two methodologies, no concrete offer of any reasonable compensation was ever made by Venezuela.\n\n128.\n\nThe change in the Respondent's positions, moving back from a more market oriented approach to the original basis referring to book value or similar lower value levels, can also be explained by the fact that at the time when negotiations were breaking down, the first active steps taken in this arbitral proceeding were looming, with the first session of the Tribunal scheduled for 13 September 2008, and the Claimants' Memorial filed on 15 September 2008. The Claimants were certainly aware, weeks ahead, that they were going to claim about US$ 30 billion for compensation. This must explain that they were not prepared to settle with the Respondent for a much lesser amount. On the Respondent's side the view prevailed that ICSID jurisdiction would be denied and the matter be litigated in ICC Arbitration.94 Under these circumstances, both Parties had no reason to pursue negotiations in the near future. This must have been the situation as well when representatives of both sides had an unsuccessful meeting in April 2009 in Vienna.95\n\nCf. Witness Mommer, TR, Day 4, p. 1150/16-17, 1193/10-11, 1194/7-12; Mr. Lyons, U.S. Embassy cable of 5 September 2008 (C-684).\n\nWitness Goff simply mentioned that this meeting took place and the individuals involved (TR-E, Day 2, p. 504/16-18, 505/2-4, 587/13-14, 588/2-22). Witness Sheet told the Tribunal that they talked about the project but that the discussion didn't go anywhere (TR-E, Day 3, p. 805/20-806/1).\n\n129.\n\nIn conclusion, it is undisputed that the Respondent at no time made any compensation payments to the Claimants or any other performance equivalent to such compensation, *i.e.* through an asset swap. The explanations provided above demonstrate that the Respondent has not made any reasonable offer for such a payment or other equivalent contribution to be made in the near future, either through the negotiations that had been conducted or on its own initiative. The Claimants are right when they state that the Respondent did not produce a single Venezuelan-sourced document in support of its position.96\n\nThe Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 28.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that the Respondent's insistence on the relevance of the compensation formulas for Venezuela's approach towards an agreement with ConocoPhillips is not convincing in this respect. At no time did the Respondent or its Witness Mommer demonstrate through a concrete submission whether, and if so, to what extent these formulas would have had an impact in calculating the economic dimension of ConocoPhillips' migration into *empresas mixtas*, with the effect that the Association Agreements, including the formulas, would have been terminated. Additionally, no evidence was produced of a possible influence of these formulas on calculations based on book values or similar concepts as they were prevailing in Venezuela's methods used in relation to the compensation for the expropriation of ConocoPhillips' assets.97 In any event, the relevance of the compensation formulas could only be demonstrated in relation to a concrete offer for compensation. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that such input was included in Venezuela's proposals made by the end of March 2007. After that date, no further offer for payment was made. The compensation formulas were a matter internal to Venezuela's negotiators.98 The Respondent's Witnesses explained that these formulas were mentioned by Dr. Mommer and subsequently by Dr. Bou\u00e9 for the first time at the last meeting on 4 September 2008; they did not have any impact on the negotiations which had, by then, definitely broken down.99 The corresponding conclusion of the Tribunal in paragraph 394 of the 2013 Decision is still valid today. The matter was not raised as part of the calculations but in relation to the arbitration.100 Therefore, the Respondent's submission in this respect is pure speculation.\n\nWitness Mommer's explanations are based on principles, stating that \"fair market value could not be assessed without considering the impact of the compensation mechanisms, which for us was an integral part of fair market value\". When ConocoPhillips told the U.S. Embassy that Venezuela \"had moved away from using book value\", the meaning was that Venezuela was willing to discuss compensation without applying the formulas in a good faith effort to reach a settlement, but without ever abandoning its legal position regarding the formulas. (cf. Third Supplemental Direct Testimony of 7 January 2015, para. 3.) They were not successful in the negotiations with Exxon and ConocoPhillips \"because of these limitation provisions\" (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1128/7-9).\n\nWitness Mommer (TR-E, Day 3, p. 955/21-958/13). Witness Goff told the Tribunal that the issue of the compensation provisions had no impact during the settlement negotiations; they were not discussed at all (TR-E, Day 2, p. 583/20-586/5). Witness Lyons noted that they were simply mentioned twice by Dr. Mom mer but not associated with any discussion or offer (TR-E, Day 3, p. 746/13-748/12, 755/2-756/20). The first time was in June 2007 when Dr. Mommer said that the formulas were irrelevant, and the second time was at the last meeting on 4 September 2008 where Dr. Mommer said that the formulas were relevant for the ICC Arbitration (TR-E, Day 3, p. 746/7-11, 748/8-12, 756/1-8).\n\nWitness Bou\u00e9, Supplemental Direct Testimony of 7 January 2015, para. 2; TR-E, Day 3, p. 881/18-882/18, 886/9-13, 888/18-22, 893/1-896/4. See also Witness Mommer, TR, Day 4, p. 1031/5-1037/5, noting that he did not remember that the matter had been raised at prior meetings. He further explained that the limitations resulting from the compensation provisions were actually affecting the market price and were relevant when the Contract was relevant; this made a big issue at the end where there remained no way to agree (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1183/1-22).\n\nWitness Bou\u00e9, TR-E, Day 3, 894/17-896/4.\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent also recalls, together with Witness Mommer101, that ConocoPhillips' own vision of fair market value included, in addition to reviewed figures taking account of oil price increases, valuations based on the 2004 fiscal regime that no longer existed; ConocoPhillips did not consider indeed either the extraction tax or the 50% income tax that were both applicable to all companies in the petroleum industry102. This was explained by Witness Mommer as the \"qualitative difference between Market Value, according to Conoco and according to us\", further referring to: \"This big gap, old and new fiscal regime, [l]imitations or not.\"103 The Tribunal understands that these are factors of major importance in considering the difference in the negotiating parties' respective positions. Another important dividing factor was the applicable oil price for the remaining 28 years of the Projects.104 The Respondent confirms: \"The parties did not agree on what fair market value was, and could not agree given the difference in premises.\"105 However, this does not in any way change the fact that there is no evidence that any compensation was provided or offered on the Respondent's behalf to the Claimants, including or not amounts or portions derived from such taxes.\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 1008/14-16; Day 4, p. 1173/19-22, 1191/18-1192/9.\n\nWitness Goff responded that the valuations were based upon the original fiscal policy (TR-E, Day 2, p. 513/2-9), but he was also less affirmative (TR-E, Day 2, p. 533/2-20). Witness Mommer noted that when they had discussions at the 29 March 2007 meeting, ConocoPhillips ignored the fiscal measures (TR-E, Day 3, p. 1008/6-7). He added that the offers made by ConocoPhillips in June and August (on an asset swap) parted from the position that the old fiscal regime applied (TR-E, Day 4, p. 1052/15-17). On 16 June 2008, an \"Upstream Update\" was presented by ConocoPhillips that included both 2004 and 2007 fiscal terms (C-693, slides 7, 8 and 10, the latter noting that the risk-adjusted arbitration value is higher than the proposed settlement range under fiscal terms in effect on 26 June 2007).\n\nTR-E, Day 4, p. 1074/5-8\n\nCf. the presentation of January 2008 under Exhibit C-696.\n\nThe Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief (para. 11), adding to the quoted part of the sentence that there is no question that the Respondent negotiated on that basis.\n\n*3. The Respondent's allegations on the Claimants' misrepresentations*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Respondent's claim based on the Claimants' alleged misrepresentation is focused on the Claimants' omission to provide the Tribunal with relevant information that would have lead the Tribunal to decide otherwise than it did in its 2013 Decision. The Respondent's claim is explained in large part by its misunderstanding of the true meaning of the Tribunal's ruling in paragraph 404(d) of its Decision. As explained above, the Tribunal's statement did not include a finding of a lack of good faith on the part of the Respondent in the course of the negotiation for compensation. Therefore, the Claimants cannot be blamed for any alleged misrepresentation that would have caused the Tribunal to reach such a conclusion. The Tribunal adds that the Respondent rightly observes that some of the presentations filed with the Tribunal on 31 August 2016 are explicit in respect of the constructive cooperation between the teams conducting the discussions after November 2007.\n\n133.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, any assertion of misrepresentation on the Claimants' part would be reduced to a claim that relevant information was unduly retained or that evidence was presented that was either forged or otherwise misleading.\n\n134.\n\nThe legal principle at stake in this respect is not specified by the Respondent with more detail than by reference to wrongful conduct, misconduct and fraud. The Respondent does not explain whether and why a case of misrepresentation is included in such principle, and if so, what kind of misrepresentation is relevant. Indeed, in the broad sense of its meaning, \"misrepresentation\" before a tribunal could include any conduct of a party convinced of its factual allegations some of which might be considered as wrong or irrelevant by the tribunal when adducing the pertinent evidence.106 The Respondent does not elaborate on this crucial point. It accepts that the legal principle referred to includes the notion of good faith, together with other expressions, but it does not define in any way what kind of misrepresentations might reach such threshold.107 It appears sufficient for present purposes to retain that a simple allegation of facts that during the proceeding prove to be wrong is not sufficient to represent \"wrong conduct\" or \"misconduct\" under the legal principle the Respondent refers to. There should be a predominant element of fraud, bad faith or of an intention to mislead the tribunal to the detriment of the opposing party before such principle could be considered as relevant.108\n\nSuch language is used by the Respondent when contending that \"key statements of fact made to this Tribunal by Claimants, which were relied upon by the majority in its 2013 decision, were untrue in material respects\" (Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 41).\n\nThe Respondent admits that the relevant threshold is unclear: \"There must be some point beyond which flagrant misrepresentations of fact, whose falsity is exposed by the testimony of one's own witness, must be corrected.\" (Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 43).\n\nIn relation to the Claimants' alleged misrepresentation of the negotiations through the reports made to the U.S. Embassy, the Respondent invokes a breach of the Confidentiality Agreement but it admits that there was no damage resulting from that breach (Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para.24).\n\n135.\n\nIn respect of the relevant facts alleged by the Respondent in support of its claim on misrepresentation, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed to provide any convincing evidence in support of its assertion, which appears reduced to the simple question whether or not Venezuela had submitted an offer based on fair market value during its negotiations with ConocoPhillips' representatives. The Respondent's allegation that the WikiLeaks cables provide such evidence has been shown to be wrong. Even if one came to a different conclusion on this point, there would still be no ground for accusing the Claimants of misrepresentation when the true fact to be represented is under the control of the Respondent who is at liberty to demonstrate that it had submitted an offer for compensation based on fair market value. The Respondent has not done so. The Respondent's Witness Bou\u00e9 confirmed to the Tribunal that he had not provided any explanation or produced any documentary evidence in support of the Respondent's allegation.109 Therefore, it has not provided evidence either of the fact that it had made such offer, or of the allegation that the Claimants were misrepresenting relevant facts before the Tribunal. The Tribunal adds that if misrepresentations had been made, such as those alleged by the Respondent, the rules of procedure applicable in this proceeding, providing in particular for crossexamination of witnesses, have proven to establish the pertinent facts and to render any misrepresentation ineffective.\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 871/14-873/16.\n\n136.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Respondent's claim in respect of the Claimants' alleged misrepresentations must fail.\n\n**V. Article 6 of the BIT**\n---------------------------\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded in its 2013 Decision that the Respondent committed a breach of Article 6(c) of the BIT by not respecting its obligation to negotiate in good faith on the basis of market value for the compensation to be provided to the Claimants for the taking of its assets.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by recalling that Article 6(c) is part of Article 6 which prohibits the host State from taking measures to expropriate or nationalize investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party unless certain conditions are complied with. Its letter (c) constitutes one of the \"conditions\" which must be complied with in order that the measure constituting or equivalent to an expropriation or nationalization does not constitute a breach of the obligation to abstain from taking such measure. The question whether the provision of letter (c) has been complied with is crucial in the instant case, because it is settled that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela had complied with the two other requirements, prescribing that the measures taken must have been taken in the public interest and in compliance with due process of law (a) and that they were not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking binding upon the Contracting Parties (b).110\n\nThere is no dispute on the Tribunal's record in this respect. In relation to one issue raised by the Claimants, the Tribunal concluded in its 2013 Decision that no undertaking as contemplated in Article 6(b) can be found in the Tribunal's record (cf. paras. 344-352).\n\n139.\n\nWhen comparing the terms used in Article 6 and those used in paragraph 404(d) of the 2013 Decision, there is an apparent difference due to the fact that the term \"condition\" is used in one place, whereas the term \"obligation\" appears in the other. As will be seen, the use of these different words does not make any difference.\n\n140.\n\nThe provision of just compensation to the investor is of course to be understood as an obligation on the part of a host State intending to proceed with an expropriation or nationalization. It is thus implicit in Article 6(c) even if the term is not used expressly. This was clearly the understanding of the Tribunal when drafting its 2013 Decision.\n\n141.\n\nHowever, the nature of such obligation has to be understood in the specific framework of Article 6. The obligation implicitly referred to in Article 6(c) is one of the three pertinent requirements which must be complied with by the host State if it proceeds to expropriate or nationalize the investor's investment. Beyond this function, it has no legal autonomy.111\n\nThe 2013 Decision identified the issue whether such obligation was breached or not as one of \"four issues\" to be dealt with as part of \"several issues\" arising out of Article 6 of the BIT (para. 334), further noting that the Parties' contentions in respect of Article 6(c) related to the lawfulness of the taking of the investments (para. 343).\n\n142.\n\nIndeed, a breach of an obligation contained in Article 6(c), as stated in the 2013 Decision, does not have the effect of providing the aggrieved party with a claim for damages based on such breach. The legal effect of such breach appears exclusively in the overall context of Article 6, because the non-compliance with the requirements of letter (c) means that the measures taken by the host State do not comply with the conditions set out in this provision.\n\n143.\n\nThe 2013 Decision did not state, nor did the Tribunal ever say so elsewhere, that the breach of the obligation to negotiate in good faith the compensation to be provided to the Claimants was the cause of the Claimants' claim for damages and the foundation of the opening of the *quantum* phase. This was all the more so as the Claimants had never made such a claim.\n\n144.\n\nIndeed, both Parties understood the 2013 Decision precisely in that way.112 For the Claimants, \"the Tribunal's ultimate and unassailable conclusion was that Venezuela acted unlawfully in expropriating the three Projects.\"113 The Respondent shared the Claimants' view on this point as it noted that the Tribunal's Majority Decision contains a \"finding of unlawful nationalization\"114, noting however in its final Brief on Quantum of 30 December 2016 that \"no finding of unlawful expropriation has ever been made in this case\" (paras. 15, and 3, 16). In addition, the Parties are both of the view that the setting of the date of valuation at the date of the Award cannot be understood otherwise than if there was an unlawful expropriation.115\n\nAs the Claimants noted at the August 2016 Hearing: \"The Parties went on to draft their pleadings on the quantum issues on the common basis that the expropriation had been unlawful.\" (TR-E, Day 1, p. 23/17-19).\n\nClaimants' Memorial on Quantum of 19 May 2014, para. 8. Similar statements are contained in Claimants' Reply on Quantum of 13 October 2014, paras. 2, 16, 87. See also the Claimants' letters of 2 March and 15 April 2016, their Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 2, 10, 14-20 and Final Submission on Quantum of 30 December 2016, paras. 12, 22, 65, 71, 78.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum of 18 August 2014, paras. 8 (page 6), 36.\n\nCf. the Respondent's First Brief on the Application for Reconsideration dated 28 October 2013, para. 2, and its statements at the August 2016 Hearing (TR-E, Day 1, p. 195/5-19, 203/2-17); the Claimants' opening statement at the same Hearing (TR-E, Day 1, p. 18/16-19/13, 21/10-14). See also the 2013 Decision, paras. 343 and 401.\n\n145.\n\nThe conclusion of this analysis is that the term \"obligation\", as it is used in paragraph 404(d) of the 2013 Decision, must be understood as having the same meaning as the term \"condition\" found in Article 6 of the BIT. If and to the extent that the requirements of Article 6(c) have not been complied with, one of the three cumulative conditions set out in Article 6 has not been fulfilled, and the effect is that Article 6 has been breached.\n\n146.\n\nWhen reading the 2013 Decision, no other conclusion can be derived from the finding of the Tribunal in paragraph 404(d). This is so even when one recognizes that the *dispositif*, as this has been observed, does not contain an expressly labeled conclusion on the effects of the Respondent's breach of Article 6(c).\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that the requirement of compensation was one of the necessary conditions for an expropriation to be \"lawful\" (paras. 334, 343, 401). Using the same logic, the finding that one of these conditions has not been met must be understood as having the effect of rendering the expropriation in June 2007 unlawful.\n\n148.\n\nThe 2013 Decision did not state this conclusion explicitly in its *dispositif*.116 This could have been done in the Award. However, in light of the controversies that have been raised, depending whether one makes a narrow or a broader reading of the finding in paragraph 404(d), and after having granted the Parties ample opportunity to submit their positions on the matter, both through written submissions and in the August 2016 Hearing, the Tribunal has decided to rule now explicitly on this matter.\n\nThe Respondent had raised an objection in this respect and submitted its reasoning in its letters dated 11 March and 15 May 2016, further relying on the dissenting opinions submitted by Professor Abi-Saab on 10 March 2014 and by Professor Bucher on 9 February 2016.\n\n149.\n\nThe Claimants requested the Tribunal to declare that Venezuela has breached Article 6 of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating and/or taking measures equivalent to expropriation with respect to ConocoPhillips' investments in Venezuela and to order Venezuela to pay damages to ConocoPhillips for its breaches of the Treaty.117\n\nCf. the Claimants' Request for Relief in its full version as quoted in the 2013 Decision, para. 212\n\n150.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal's record reveals that the first two requirements of Article 6 have been met. An expropriation or nationalization requires a \"taking\" to be operated by the authorities of the host State. Such taking may cover rights other than rights *in rem*, as confirmed by Article 6 which refers to the broad concept of \"investments\". In the instant case, such taking became effective on 26 June 2007, when ConocoPhillips' assets were definitively taken over by Venezuela and by PdVSA's or its subsidiaries' em-ployees.118 This taking did not extend to the assets exclusively. It meant that Venezuela assumed directly the activities performed by the Associations and it extinguished Cono-coPhillips' ownership interests.119 It necessarily included the rights contained and held by ConocoPhillips through the Association Agreements and all other contractual undertakings relating to the three Projects. As Witness Mommer recalled, at that date, the Association Agreements were terminated.120\n\nWhen the Respondent argues that ConocoPhillips was subject to a transfer of control and restructuring of the Projects only, not including an expropriation, it refers exclusively to the forced migration provided for in Decree-Law 5,200 (Counter-Memorial of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela dated 27 July 2009, para. 277). The expropriation took place by virtue of Article 5 of Decree 5,200 when such migration failed after a four-month negotiation period elapsed, with the effect that ConocoPhillips was forced to hand over its investment to the host State.\n\nWitness Mommer, TR-E, Day 3, p. 993/8-994/17.\n\nThe Witness used the term \"disappear\" (2010 Hearing, TR-E, Day 7, p. 1838/16-17), further explaining that the assets were taken over (TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 7, p. 1716/14-15, 1854/12-13).\n\n151.\n\nThere is no dispute about the fact that the measures enforced on 26 June 2007 have not been taken against \"just compensation\" as required by Article 6(c). In fact, no compensation has been paid at all. Therefore, the question whether compensation was provided that meets the threshold of market value is irrelevant.\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal, in its 2013 Decision, recognized a margin of flexibility and accepted, by reference to experience in investment practice, that the requirement of compensation provided on time is still complied with if the Parties \"engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the standard set, in this case, in the BIT\" (para. 362). When referring to the language used in Article 6(c), such negotiation should be engaged either immediately before the measures were taken or when the impending measures became public knowledge, which, in the instant case, refers to a date shortly before 26 June 2007. However, such negotiation that might serve as a transitory substitute for actual payment must be of a nature resulting in providing satisfaction to the investors with equal or with similar effects than actual payment. Article 6(c) further requires that payment shall be made \"without undue delay\"; compared to a situation where compensation is addressed through negotiation, such substitute of actual payment is acceptable in the context of Article 6(c) exclusively if it leads to positive results without undue delay. In the normal course of proceeding with such negotiations efficiently and without delay, the host State must necessarily take a pro-active approach, which implies that it should put forward concrete proposals likely to meet the required level of compensation (*e.g.* market value) and having a chance to be approved by the investor.121\n\nThe Claimants submit that a binding offer of compensation must be made (Post-Hearing Brief, para. 34).\n\n153.\n\nThe Respondent has not complied with any of these requirements. The negotiations that took place before the taking over of ConocoPhillips's assets and interests were conducted by Venezuela on a model representing a migration into *empresas mixtas*, based on a substance and an amount of compensation that had nothing to do with a compensation representing market values covering the loss of profits that were to be earned by Cono-coPhillips' companies until the end of the lifetime of the Projects. When the negotiations were engaged in parallel to the arbitration proceeding, Venezuela never made a concrete proposal. The evidence before the Tribunal demonstrates with stringent clarity that no offer was ever made by Venezuela in order to put a positive end to the negotiation. In addition, Witness Mommer never referred to any written offer submitted by Venezuela's representatives, while admitting that the Government of Venezuela was not authorized to make any monetary commitment without formalizing it in writing.122 Finally, when Venezuela decided to abandon the negotiations on 8 September 2008, this was a clear sign of its preference to have the matter settled through arbitration, which had no other meaning than admitting that the requirement for just and timely compensation based on market value, as contained in Article 6(c) of the BIT, had not been complied with.\n\nTR-E, Day 3, p. 971/22-972/5.\n\n154.\n\nThese reasons support the Tribunal's conclusion that it accepts the Claimants' request and declares that the Respondent had breached Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n155.\n\nThe 2013 Decision's finding that the Respondent breached Article 6(c) of the BIT is incidental to this conclusion. Indeed, as noted above, Article 6(c) represents only one of the three cumulative requirements composing the BIT's provision on expropriation and nationalization. Therefore, having concluded that Article 6 of the BIT has been breached, the Tribunal will not need to address in its Award any breach of Article 6(c) that relates only to one of the three conditions that must be met by the host State in order to make the taking lawful.\n\n**VI. Decision**\n----------------\n\n156.\n\nBased on the reasons given above, the Tribunal reaches the conclusions as follows:\n\n1. The Respondent's Third Application for Reconsideration is dismissed.\n\n2. The Respondent's claim based on the Claimants' alleged misrepresentations to the Tribunal is dismissed.\n\n3. The Tribunal declares that Venezuela has breached Article 6 of the BIT by unlawfully expropriating the Claimants' investments in the three Projects in the Orinoco Belt in Venezuela."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2019-03-08T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 2 November 2007, the Claimants submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") a Request for Arbitration against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"Venezuela\" or \"the Respondent\") pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention. On 13 December 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on 23 July 2008. Its members were Judge Kenneth Keith, a national of New Zealand, President, appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention; The Hon. L. Yves Fortier, QC, a Canadian national, appointed by the Claimants; and Sir Ian Brownlie, CBE, QC, a British national, appointed by the Respondent. On 1 February 2010, the Tribunal was reconstituted, with Professor Georges Abi-Saab, an Egyptian national, being appointed by the Respondent, following Sir Ian Brownlie's passing.\n\n3.\n\nFrom 31 May to 12 June 2010 a hearing took place on jurisdiction and merits, followed by two days of pleadings on 21 and 23 July 2010. On 3 September 2013, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits (\"the 2013 Decision\"), stating in its paragraph 404 the conclusions quoted below in Section II.\n\n4.\n\nOn 8 September 2013, Counsel for the Respondent submitted a letter requesting a clarification and further explanations from the Tribunal regarding certain findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits relating in particular to the 2013 Decision's conclusion on the negotiation on compensation that took place between the Parties (the \"First Application for Reconsideration\"). In its letter, Counsel for the Respondent also requested \"a limited and focused hearing\" to address the specific issues raised.\n\n5.\n\nCounsel for the Claimants replied to the Respondent's letter on 10 September 2013. The Claimants opposed the Respondent's requests and proposed instead a briefing schedule for submissions on quantum.\n\n6.\n\nBetween 11 and 23 September 2013, several further letters were submitted to the Tribunal by the Parties.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 1 October 2013, the Tribunal fixed a schedule for the Parties to file submissions on: (i) the Tribunal's power to reconsider the 2013 Decision; and (ii) a possible scheduling for quantum briefs. The Parties duly submitted two rounds of written pleadings.\n\n8.\n\nIn its Decision of 10 March 2014, the Tribunal stated that so far as the matter set out in the Respondent's Application for Reconsideration was concerned \"this decision is limited to answering the question whether the Tribunal has the power which the Respondent would have it exercise. The decision does not address the grounds the Respondent invokes for reconsidering the part of the Decision which it challenges and the evidence which it sees as supporting those grounds. The power must be shown to exist before it can be exercised\"1.\n\nDecision of 10 March 2014 on Respondent's First Request for Reconsideration, para. 9.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that it did not have the power to reconsider the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, with Professor Georges Abi-Saab dissenting. In the absence of such power it implicitly followed in the Tribunal's Decision that the Respondent's Request was dismissed.\n\n10.\n\nProfessor Georges Abi-Saab resigned on 20 February 2015 with immediate effect. On 10 August 2015 the Tribunal was reconstituted, with Professor Andreas Bucher, a Swiss national, being appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n11.\n\nOn that same day, 10 August 2015, the Respondent submitted a Second Application for Reconsideration directed at the Tribunal's Decision of 10 March 2014. It requested a hearing on the application. The Respondent recalled that it had, immediately following the 2013 Decision, applied for reconsideration, pointing out\n\ncertain obvious factual, legal and logical errors the correction of any one of which would require a change in the majority's conclusions on the issue of good faith negotiations. Of particular relevance to this [Second] Application, Respondent pointed out that cables from the U.S. Embassy released after the hearing in this case in 2010, which reported on the briefings made by the chief ConocoPhillips negotiators to the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, left no doubt that the representations made by ConocoPhillips to the Tribunal regarding Respondent's supposed unwillingness to negotiate fair market value had been completely false, and that it was in fact ConocoPhillips which was seeking compensation \u2018on top of the fair market value of the assets.' Since the majority had relied on Claimants' misrepresentations in reaching its conclusion on bad faith negotiation, Respondent assumed that the Tribunal would want to reconsider the Majority Merits Decision to avoid an obvious gross miscarriage of justice. That assumption was based on the premise that every tribunal has the power to correct its own decision while the case is still pending before it and should exercise that power if its decision were indeed based on patently false representations2. (footnote omitted)\n\nRespondent's Second Application for Reconsideration, pp. 2-3.\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 August 2015, the Claimants responded in these terms:\n\nThe application is frivolous and dilatory. Venezuela has not even attempted to articulate a legal basis for the admissibility of a request to reconsider a reconsideration decision - because there is none. The Tribunal's 10 March Decision considered and rejected the same arguments that Venezuela now raises. It has *res judicata* effect and may not be revisited or reviewed in any way prior to the rendering of the final Award3.\n\nThe Claimants requested that the Tribunal dismiss the Respondent's application forthwith and promptly reschedule the final hearing.\n\nThe Claimants' letter of 12 August 2015, p. 1.\n\n13.\n\nLater that same day, the Respondent commented upon the Claimants' letter. On 13 August 2015 the Claimants stated that their letter of the previous day provided a complete answer to the Respondent's points in its later letter.\n\n14.\n\nOn 15 August 2015, the Parties were advised that the Tribunal \"is currently considering the Respondent's application, including its request for a hearing, and will revert to the parties in due course. The Tribunal considers that no further submissions are needed at this point\"4.\n\nICSID's letter of 15 August 2015, p. 2.\n\n15.\n\nOn 9 November 2015, the Respondent submitted a proposal to disqualify L. Yves Fortier QC as arbitrator. In terms of Rule 9(6) of the Arbitration Rules, the proceeding was suspended until 15 December 2015 when the proposal was dismissed. Two further proposals were made by the Respondent on 26 February 2016 and 22 July 2016 (Respondent's Fifth and Sixth Proposals to disqualify L. Yves Fortier), both dismissed on 15 March 2016 and 26 July 2016, respectively.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal rendered its Decision on the Respondent's Second Application for Reconsideration on 9 February 2016. It explained that it had approached the matter, as have the Parties, in terms of seeking the existence and source of the power the Respondent would have it exercise. It is not a matter of finding a rule prohibiting the existence or exercise of such a power. That power has to be found to exist. The Respondent has failed to make such demonstration.\n\n17.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal, by a majority, dismissed the Second Application for Reconsideration made by the Respondent for the reconsideration of its Decision on Respondent's First Request for Reconsideration of 10 March 2014, with Professor Andreas Bucher dissenting.\n\n18.\n\nOn 24 February 2016, the Tribunal held an Organizational Hearing in Washington, D.C., where several outstanding matters of procedure were discussed, including the scheduling and the agenda of the forthcoming hearings on quantum. A number of procedural issues were recorded in the Minutes and further refined in ICSID's letter of 8 June 2016.\n\n19.\n\nOn 21 March 2016, the President of the Tribunal, Judge Kenneth J. Keith resigned as arbitrator in this case with immediate effect. On 22 April 2016 the Tribunal was reconstituted, with Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, a Colombian national, being appointed as presiding arbitrator by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n20.\n\nOn 21 March 2016, the Respondent submitted the Updated Expert Report of Vladimir Brailovsky and Daniel Flores, dated 18 March 2016. On the same date, the Claimants submitted the March 2016 Update prepared by their Experts Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller (Compass Lexecon).\n\n21.\n\nOn 21 April 2016, the Claimants submitted the Rebuttal Expert Report prepared by Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller (Compass Lexecon) and the Second Expert Report of Richard Strickland, while, on the same date, the Respondent communicated the Valuation Update Reply prepared by Vladimir Brailovsky and Daniel Flores.\n\n22.\n\nIn accordance with the conclusions of the Organizational Hearing, the Claimants submitted on 15 April 2016 additional exhibits in the record (C-623 to C-671), as did the Respondent (R-603 to R-641).\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated 20 April 2016, the Respondent filed with the Tribunal the Third Application for Reconsideration of the Majority's Decision of 9 February 2016, containing the same request and based on the same grounds as the Respondent's two earlier Applications. The Claimants responded by letter of 21 April 2016.\n\n24.\n\nAt the Organizational Hearing of 24 February 2016, the Claimants were ordered to produce a number of documents, which the Tribunal considered were not privileged. By letter of 11 May 2016, the Tribunal decided the last remaining issue in respect of the production of documents.\n\n25.\n\nAnother decision of the Tribunal at the Organizational Hearing was to invite the Parties to comment on the issues other than quantum that they considered were still outstanding, if any. The Tribunal received submissions from the Claimants on 2 March 2016 and from the Respondent on 11 March 2016. After due deliberation, the Tribunal considered it necessary to invite the Parties, by letter dated 17 March 2016, to file an additional round of submissions, which were received from the Claimants on 15 April 2016 and from the Respondent on 15 May 2016. The Parties were invited to specifically address the Claimants' request for a declaration of breach of Article 6 of the BIT (C-2, R-13).\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal held a first phase of the hearing on quantum on 15-19 August 2016 in respect of the following issues: (i) the scope of the Tribunal's finding on Article 6(c) of the BIT and the outcome of the Claimants' claim for a declaration that the Respondent breached Article 6 of the BIT; (ii) the Respondent's Third Application for Reconsideration; (iii) the *misrepresentation* allegation; (iv) the relevance of the *compensation formulas* and (v) the impact of the ongoing ICC arbitration proceedings, if any5.\n\nThe hearing was recorded and a transcript established (in English and Spanish), as this had been done for the 24 February 2016 Organizational Hearing and for the hearings held on 31 May to 12 June and 21 and 23 July 2010. The same has been done in respect of all other hearings following thereafter. The Tribunal uses the condensed version of the transcripts. All transcripts have been reviewed and amended by the Parties, either directly in the (corrected) transcript or on a separate list. The numbering of days used for the February and March 2017 hearing transcripts for the Spanish version has been aligned to the numbers used for the English version. The Tribunal makes reference to the transcripts, both in English and Spanish, as they are on its record and as approved by the Parties, abstaining from amending the language for improvement or for compliance of one language version with the other. On some points both versions have to be consulted in order to reach an optimal understanding of the transcripts' respective content.\n\n27.\n\nAt the end of the hearing on 19 August 2016 and after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, providing in particular as follows:\n\n1. The Tribunal remains seized of the Respondent's Request for Reconsideration dated April 20, 2016, and of Respondent's misrepresentation claim. The Tribunal considers that it has been fully briefed on these matters, which therefore need not be addressed further.\n\n2. Pursuant to the Tribunal's order of August 17, 2016, the parties shall file with the Tribunal all documents exchanged or presentations made between them in the course of their negotiations between November 27, 2007 and September 2008, by August 31, 2016.\n\n3. By September 19, 2016, the parties shall submit post-hearing briefs addressing the evidence adduced in the course of the hearing. The parties may include in their post-hearing briefs comments with respect to the documents produced pursuant to paragraph No. 2 above.\n\n28.\n\nProcedural Order No. 4 further provided that the Parties shall proceed through joint and expeditious cooperation in establishing new and consolidated expert reports (1) on the production capacities of the Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro Projects (para. 4) and (2) on the amount of damages resulting from the expropriation of the three Projects (para. 5), in each case on the basis of a jointly agreed structure of issues. In both cases, it was determined that the parties shall proceed through an initial exchange of their reports between them without copying the Tribunal and then revise the reports as necessary in order that each party may submit its final version to the Tribunal by 17 October 2016 for the reports on production capacities and by 17 November 2016 for the reports on damages.\n\n29.\n\nFurther instructions were given to the Parties by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 4 in respect of the substance of the expert reports on the amount of damages. The reports shall contain determinations on whether the valuation was made at the date of the expropriation, *i.e.* 26 June 2007, or on 31 December 2016, in each case taking into account, or not taking into account, the compensation formulas contained in the Association Agreements (para. 6). The final briefs on quantum were scheduled for 30 December 2016 (para. 7). The Order fixed the dates for the hearing on the second quantum phase at 21-25 February 2017 (para. 8), to which a further hearing was added by ICSID's letter of 2 September 2016 for 27-31 March 2017.\n\n30.\n\nOn 31 August 2016, the Tribunal received from each party a set of presentations that had been used in the course of the negotiations between 27 November 2007 and 8 September 2008. Most of the documents submitted by each party were identical6.\n\nThe Claimants' Exhibits C-688 to C-694; Annexes 1 to 10 to the Respondent's letter dated 31 August 2016.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants' and the Respondent's Post-Hearing Briefs were filed with the Tribunal on 19 September 2016.\n\n32.\n\nIn compliance with the procedure provided in paragraph 4 of Procedural Order No. 4 and the adjustments noted by the Tribunal's letters of 5 September and 3 October 2016, the Parties submitted consolidated expert reports on the production capacities of the three Projects on 17 October 2016 as follows: the Claimants' Expert Reports prepared respectively by Richard Strickland and by Neil K. Earnest of Muse Stancil; the Respondent's Expert Report of Jes\u00fas Rafael Pati\u00f1o Murillo.\n\n33.\n\nFollowing the procedure provided in paragraph 5 of the Order, the Parties submitted consolidated expert reports on the amount of damages resulting from the expropriation of the three Projects on 17 November 2016 as follows: The Claimants' Consolidated Update Report on the Damages Assessment for the Taking of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela prepared by their Experts Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller (Compass Lexecon), and the Respondent's Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation prepared by Vladimir Brailovsky and Daniel Flores.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their Final Submission on Quantum, and the Respondent its Brief on Quantum, both on 30 December 2016.\n\n35.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's invitation in its 6 May 2016 letter, the Parties communicated their submissions and valuation reports they had filed until 20 May 2016 with the ICC Tribunal (Case No. 20549/ASM), where ConocoPhillips were the claimants and PDVSA and two if its subsidiaries were the respondents. These briefs were complementary to the two Requests for Arbitration dated 10 October 2014, copies of which were communicated at an earlier date to this Tribunal (R-494, R-495). Each Party provided explanatory comments related to these proceedings by letters both dated 20 May 2016. On 16 September 2016, the Respondent filed with the Tribunal its Rejoinder submitted in the ICC proceedings on 9 September 2016. Finally, with the Claimants' agreement and as agreed by the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted on 16 December 2016 the transcript of the hearing that took place from 28 November to 10 December 2016 in the ICC Arbitration (R-654). By letter to the Parties dated 19 December 2016, the Tribunal recalled that pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Minutes of the Organizational Hearing of 24 February 2016, as reiterated in its directions of 6 May, 1 July and 12 September 2016, this material has been received for information purposes only and will not, accordingly, be accorded any evidentiary value in this case. The Tribunal also informed the Parties in its letter dated 23 December 2016 that it did not grant leave for the Parties to submit documents referred to during the ICC hearing or other documents not on the record in the ICC Arbitration, or to file additional legal authorities7.\n\nThe Respondent complained at the 2017 September Hearing that it was prevented from updating its information and allegations as per 31 December 2016 because documents and evidence it had submitted to the ICC Arbitration had not been admitted into the proceeding of this Tribunal, in particular a more recent witness statement prepared by Mr. Figuera; cf. TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 4830:14-4832:11 (Preziosi), 4832:12-4833:17 (Kahale), 4901:3-4903:19 (Preziosi). The Tribunal recalls that it explained in its 23 December 2016 letter that such late introduction of new evidence would not have been allowed according to ICSID Arbitration Rules 34 and 35, in particular because no further cross-examination (not offered by the Respondent anyhow) would have been possible. The Tribunal also noted that their way of proceeding was not intended or even contemplated at the Organizational Hearing of 24 February 2016, and this with the Parties' agreement. No request for the production of further witness statements was made by the Respondent when the draft of Procedural Order No. 4 was submitted to the Parties for the purpose of receiving their comments (cf. TR-E, 2016 August Hearing, Day 5, p. 1523:2-1534:19). Nonetheless, the Respondent filed with the Tribunal Figuera Appendices 157, 161, 162, 164, 165, 169, 171, 172, 176 as attachments to its 2017 Post-Hearing Brief. Moreover, the Respondent let its valuation experts attach to their opinion material from the ICC Arbitration, which has no evidentiary value in the present case, *i.e.* Figuera Appendices 154-172 (Brailovsky&Flores, Valuation Update Reply, 21 April 2016) and excerpts of Figuera Witness Statements together with Appendices 176 and 178 (cf. Brailovsky&Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, footnote 2). On 10 January 2019 the Tribunal rejected the Respondent's unsolicited request dated 8 January 2019 to consider a model on data relating to the Corocoro Project that had been submitted in an ICC arbitration instituted on 30 December 2016.\n\n36.\n\nThe ICC Arbitral Tribunal rendered its Final Award on 24 April 2018 (20549/ASM/JPA). It was submitted to this Tribunal as an enclosure to the Claimants' letter dated 25 April 2018, which was followed by the Respondent's letter dated 26 April 2018. The Tribunal acknowledged receipt of both letters by its letter dated 27 April 2018, further stating that it understands that the filing of the ICC Award had the purpose of informing the Tribunal of the closing of the ICC Arbitration and that it has no other purpose. A further letter of the Respondent dated 1 May 2018 recalled the critical significance that the ICC Award had for this Party. The Claimants expressed their disagreement in an email the following day, recalling their understanding that in light of the Tribunal's letter of 27 April 2018 and paragraph 9 of Procedural Order No. 4, further submissions were precluded without the Tribunal's consent. By email of 3 May 2018, the Tribunal reconfirmed that the ICC Award has been submitted for the purpose of informing the Tribunal only and that the unsolicited correspondence submitted thereafter did not go beyond what had been presented to and argued before this Tribunal. Through the Claimants' letter dated 20 August 2018 and the Respondent's letter dated a day later, both enclosing news releases, from ConocoPhillips, Houston, and PDVSA, respectively, the Parties informed the Tribunal that a settlement agreement had been reached between these parties in respect of the collection of the amounts awarded by the ICC tribunal.\n\n**II. The 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe conclusions reached by the Tribunal's 2013 Decision read as follows:\n\n404. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. It does not have jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Investment Law and accordingly the claims by ConocoPhillips Company are dismissed; and\n\nb. It has jurisdiction under Article 9 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty over:\n\ni. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV, ConocoPhillips Hamaca BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of (1) the increase in the income tax rate which came into effect on 1 January 2007 and (2) the expropriation or migration; and\n\nii. the claims brought by ConocoPhillips Petrozuata BV and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria BV in respect of the increase in the extraction tax in effect from 24 May 2006.\n\nc. All claims based on a breach of Article 3 of the BIT are rejected.\n\nd. The Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT.\n\ne. The date of valuation of the ConocoPhillips assets is the date of the Award.\n\nf. All other claims based on a breach of Article 6(c) of the BIT are rejected.\n\ng. All other questions, including those concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the parties' determination are reserved for future determination. Items (a), (b)(i), (b)(ii), (c), (f) and (g) above have been decided unanimously by the Tribunal. Items (d) and (e) have been decided by majority, with Arbitrator Georges Abi-Saab dissenting.\n\n38.\n\nThis 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits is hereby incorporated by reference into this Award.\n\n39.\n\nSince 3 September 2013, when the ConocoPhillips Company's claims were dismissed (para. 404(a)), this Company no longer participated in this proceeding. However, this Decision was never incorporated in an award. It will be made in this Award, together with an assessment of the impact of such dismissal on the allocation of legal fees and costs (Section XV). Unless otherwise stated elsewhere in this Award, the \"Claimants\" means the three Dutch ConocoPhillips companies.\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal's Majority has decided twice that it had no power to examine the Respondent's Application for Reconsideration, each time with the third arbitrator dissenting.\n\n41.\n\nNonetheless, the true meaning and effects of the 2013 Decision's statement in respect of the Respondent's conduct of the negotiation on compensation in paragraph 404(d) remained a matter of debate. The Tribunal felt that further clarity would be useful in relation to the obligation prohibiting expropriation by the host State as contained in Article 6 of the BIT, and in relation to the assessment of the Claimants' claim for damages. Further procedural developments, and particularly the August 2016 Hearing, had the effect of providing a broader view on the negotiations that actually took place between the Parties, including in the period between November 2007 and September 2008, which the Tribunal was not able to evaluate in the prior proceeding that was concluded with the 2013 Decision. Furthermore, the Respondent submitted a claim based on alleged misrepresentations made by the Claimants to the Tribunal. Therefore, the Tribunal decided that the Respondent's Third Application for Reconsideration and the misrepresentation allegation would both be addressed at the August 2016 Hearing. Both matters were dealt with in the Tribunal's Interim Decision dated 17 January 2017.\n\n**III. The 2017 Interim Decision**\n----------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe conclusions reached by the Tribunal in its Interim Decision read as follows:\n\n1. The Respondent's Third Application for Reconsideration is dismissed.\n\n2. The Respondent's claim based on the Claimants' alleged misrepresentations to the Tribunal is dismissed.\n\n3. The Tribunal declares that Venezuela has breached Article 6 of the BIT by unlawfully expropriating the Claimants' investments in the three Projects in the Orinoco Belt in Venezuela.\n\n43.\n\nThis Interim Decision is hereby incorporated by reference into this Award.\n\n44.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal explained that the true meaning of the 2013 Decision's finding in respect of the negotiation on compensation was that the Respondent failed to be involved in negotiations leading to an offer complying with the requirements of \"just compensation\" and \"market value\". The Tribunal did not find a lack of good faith on the part of the Respondent for its breach of an obligation to negotiate on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT (paras. 39-62). The Tribunal concluded that until the filing of the Claimants' Request for Arbitration and thereafter, the Respondent did not envisage, conduct or propose to ConocoPhillips a market valuation as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT (paras. 63-131). The Tribunal also decided that the Respondent's claim based on the Claimants' alleged misrepresentations must fail in light of the Respondent's failure to demonstrate that relevant information had been unduly retained by the Claimants or that they presented evidence that was either forged or otherwise misleading (paras. 67-69, 80, 93, 132-136).\n\n45.\n\nIn its 2017 Interim Decision (para. 137), the Tribunal recalled that it had concluded in its 2013 Decision that the Respondent committed a breach of Article 6(c) of the BIT by not respecting its obligation to negotiate in good faith on the basis of market value for the compensation to be provided to the Claimants for the taking of its assets (para. 404d). The Tribunal explained that the obligation implicitly referred to in Article 6(c) is one of the three pertinent requirements which must be complied with by the host State if it proceeds to expropriate or nationalize the investor's investment. Beyond this function, it has no legal autonomy. Indeed, a breach of an obligation contained in Article 6(c), as stated in the 2013 Decision, does not have the effect of providing the aggrieved party with a claim for damages based on such breach. The legal effect of such breach appears exclusively in the overall context of Article 6, because the non-compliance with the requirements of letter (c) means that the measures taken by the host State do not comply with the conditions set out in this provision.\n\n46.\n\nIf and to the extent that the requirements of Article 6(c) have not been complied with, one of the three cumulative conditions set out in Article 6 has not been fulfilled, and the effect is that Article 6 has been breached. The Tribunal recalled in its 2017 Interim Decision (para. 147) that the 2013 Decision noted that the requirement of compensation was one of the necessary conditions for an expropriation to be \"lawful\" (paras. 334, 343, 401). Using the same logic, the finding that one of these conditions has not been met must be understood as having the effect of rendering the expropriation in June 2007 unlawful.\n\n47.\n\nWhen rendering its Interim Decision, the Tribunal decided to rule explicitly on this matter (para. 148). It noted (para. 150) that the Tribunal's record reveals that the first two requirements of Article 6 have been met. An expropriation or nationalization requires a \"taking\" to be operated by the authorities of the host State. Such taking may cover rights other than rights *in rem*, as confirmed by Article 6 which refers to the broad concept of \"investments\". In the present case, such taking became effective on 26 June 2007, when ConocoPhillips' assets were definitively taken over by Venezuela and by PDVSA's or its subsidiaries' employees. This taking did not extend to the assets exclusively. It meant that Venezuela assumed directly the activities performed by the Associations and it extinguished ConocoPhillips' ownership interests8. It necessarily included the rights contained and held by ConocoPhillips through the Association Agreements and all other contractual undertakings relating to the three Projects. As Witness Mommer recalled, at that date, the Association Agreements were terminated9.\n\nWitness Mommer, TR-E, 2016 August Hearing, Day 3, p. 993:8-994:17.\n\nThe Witness used the term \"disappear\" (TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 7, p. 1838:16-17), further explaining that the assets were taken over (TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 7, p. 1716:14-15, 1854:12-13).\n\n48.\n\nThere is no dispute about the fact that the measures enforced on 26 June 2007 have not been taken against \"just compensation\" as required by Article 6(c). In fact, no compensation has been paid at all. As the Interim Decision also explains (para. 153), the negotiations that took place before the taking over of ConocoPhillips's assets and interests were conducted by Venezuela on the basis of a model representing a migration into *empresas mixtas*, based on an amount of compensation that had nothing to do with a compensation representing market values covering the loss of profits that were to be earned by ConocoPhillips' companies until the end of the lifetime of the Projects. When the negotiations took place in parallel with the arbitration proceeding, Venezuela never made a concrete proposal. The evidence before the Tribunal demonstrates with stringent clarity that no offer was ever made by Venezuela in order to put a positive end to the negotiation.\n\n49.\n\nAll the reasons given in the 2017 Interim Decision (paras. 137-155) and briefly repeated here support the Tribunal's conclusion that the Respondent had breached Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n**IV. The Final Phase on Quantum**\n----------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nShortly after rendering its Interim Decision on 17 January 2017, the Tribunal continued with the final phase of this proceeding, relating to quantum.\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal held its hearing on the second quantum phase in Washington, D.C. in two parts, the first from 21 to 25 February 2017, and the second from 27 to 31 March 2017. Present at these two sessions were (except where stated otherwise):\n\nMembers of the Tribunal\n\nDr. Eduardo Zuleta, President\n\nThe Hon. L. Yves Fortier, QC, Co-Arbitrator\n\nProfessor Andreas Bucher, Co-Arbitrator\n\nICSID Secretariat\n\nMr. Gonzalo Flores, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\nMr. Francisco Grob, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\nFor the Claimants\n\nMr. Jan Paulsson, Three Crowns LLP\n\nMr. Constantine Partasides, QC, Three Crowns LLP (only March)\n\nMr. Josh Simmons, Three Crowns LLP\n\nMr. Ben Jones, Three Crowns LLP\n\nMs. Kelly Renehan, Three Crowns LLP\n\nMr. D. Brian King, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMr. Elliot Friedman, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMr. Sam Prevatt, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMr. Lee Rovinescu, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMs. Madeline Snider, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMr. Cameron Russell, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMr. Aaron Kates Rose, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMr. Israel Guerrero, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMr. Breanna Weber, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMs. Cassia Cheung, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMr. Iain McGrath, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP\n\nMs. Jannet Carrig, ConocoPhillips\n\nMs. Laura Robertson, ConocoPhillips\n\nMs. Suzana Blades, ConocoPhillips\n\nMr. Alberto Ravell, ConocoPhillips\n\nMs. Michele Lipscomb, ConocoPhillips (only March)\n\nFor the Respondent\n\nMr. George Kahale, III, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMr. Benard V. Preziosi, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nProfessor Tullio Treves, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMs. Dori Yoldi, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMs. Arianna S\u00e1nchez, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMr. Simon Batifort, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMs. Irene Petrelli, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMs. Matilde Flores, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMr. Farshad Zahedinia, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMs. Sofia Herrera, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMr. Steven Richardson, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMs. Gloria Diaz-Bujan, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMr. Herbert Tapia, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nDr. Reinaldo Mu\u00f1oz, Attorney General, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (only March)\n\nDr. Bernard Mommer, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\n\nMs. Irama Mommer, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\n\nDr. Alvaro Silva Calderon, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\n\nDr. Joaquin Parra, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\n\nDr. A. Vanessa Gonzalez Anton, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\n\nDr. Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Oro\u00f1o, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\n\nDr. Alejandro Schmilinsky, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\n\nDr. Edoardo Orsoni, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\n\n52.\n\nAt the February hearing, the following Witnesses and Experts were heard and cross-examined:\n\nDr. Manuel A. Abdala and Professor Pablo T. Spiller, presented by the Claimants\n\nMr. Vladimir Brailowsky and Dr. Daniel Flores, presented by the Respondent\n\nMr. Albert Roy Lyons, presented by the Claimants\n\nMr. Rub\u00e9n Figuera, presented by the Respondent\n\nMr. Jes\u00fas Rafael Pati\u00f1o Murillo, presented by the Respondent\n\nDr. Richard F. Strickland, presented by the Claimants\n\nMr. Neil K. Earnest, presented by the Claimants\n\nMr. David Andrew Brown, presented by the Claimants\n\nMr. Leonardo Marcano, presented by the Respondent\n\nFollowing an exchange of views between the Parties, the Tribunal decided that Mr. Virgil Chamberlain, a witness presented by the Claimants, would not appear at the February hearing.\n\nAt the March hearing, Witnesses Lyons and Figuera were examined again, followed by the quantum Experts, Dr. Abdala and Professor Spiller for the Claimants, and Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores for the Respondent.\n\n53.\n\nShortly before the March hearing, on 20 March, the Parties provided the Tribunal, upon its request, with tables for each of the Hamaca and Petrozuata Projects containing accumulated annual production figures, listed year by year, of Extra Heavy Crude Oil (EHCO), Commercial Crude Oil (CCO), and blends, for each of the following periods: (i) commencement of the corresponding Project until 26 June 2007; (ii) June 2007 until 31 December 2016; and (iii) 1 January 2017 until the expiration of term of the corresponding Association Agreement. A similar request related to the Corocoro Project, but without any division depending on the quality of the oil. For all three Projects, the tables also contained information in respect of the Operating Expenses (OPEX) and Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) affecting the aforesaid production figures for the same periods, as well as for taxes relating to the production. The Parties were further invited to explain the operation of a windfall tax and the impact, if any, of applying the compensation provisions, assuming that such tax had applied as from 15 April 2008, the rate that would have applied for each year. In parallel to the Respondent's Assessment of Production the Claimants also submitted a set of tables relating to oil production, costs and taxes in respect of each of the Projects.\n\n54.\n\nAt the end of the March hearing, upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted a hardcopy of the invoices of CCO sold during the years 2009 to 2015, together with monthly lists of the quantities of oil sold and loaded on vessels for the purpose of exportation. Complementary tables summarizing the pertinent figures relating to production, costs and taxes were also provided. An exchange of views took place at the hearing in order to assist the Tribunal in understanding this voluminous documentation10.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 14, p. 4258:8-4297:22.\n\n55.\n\nBy letters dated 4 and 12 April 2017, the Tribunal directed the valuation experts to confer with the aim of narrowing the gaps between their respective positions related to discount rates, in general, and country risk, in particular. By letter dated 25 April 2017, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the experts had conferred but were unable to narrow the gap between their respective views.\n\n56.\n\nBy letters dated 27 April and 3 May 2017, the Tribunal requested the Parties to submit by 29 May 2017 a jointly prepared assessment, supported by their respective experts, of the actual production of the Projects (July 2007 to 31 December 2016), together with an assessment of the associated costs. The Tribunal also noted in its 27 April letter that the hearings held in February and March 2017 had clearly demonstrated that the experts had made various assumptions and assertions that were either wrong, not cross referenced to evidence on the record, or simply not supported by sufficient evidence. The Tribunal therefore requested the Parties in these two letters to continue instructing their experts to jointly work towards results elaborated on the basis of constructive cooperation. It also requested the Parties in its 27 April letter to provide the Tribunal by 19 May 2017 with an additional expert report by its respective experts on the country risk specifically associated with each Project. The deadline fixed on 19 May 2017 was subsequently extended at 26 May (letter dated 18 May 2017) and later to 2 June 2017 (letter dated 25 May 2017).\n\n57.\n\nOn 19 May 2017, the Claimants and the Respondent each submitted their Post-Hearing Briefs following the February and March hearings. The additional reports requested from the experts were provided on the same date.\n\n58.\n\nOn 2 June 2017, the Parties submitted two sets of documents containing (1) an Assessment of Production reported by the Respondent for the three Projects, commented by the Respondent and the Claimants, and (2) the Respondent's Estimated *Ex Post* Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenses (OPEX) for each Project, also commented by the Respondent and the Claimants (referred to below as \"Cost Estimations\").\n\n59.\n\nBy letters dated 8 and 14 June 2017, the Tribunal submitted to the Parties a list of questions. The Parties' answers were received on 10 July 2017, followed by rebuttal comments from each side on 31 July 2017. Upon the Tribunal's request, the Respondent submitted an English translation of Annexes 8 to 10 filed in relation to Appendix 76 of Mr. Figuera's Testimony, on 11 September 2017. Thereafter, the Tribunal invited the Parties on 13 September 2017 to prepare responses to be submitted at the forthcoming hearing on a number of supplementary questions.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal held its final hearing in Washington, D.C. on 19 to 21 September 2017.

These statements may be listed as follows:\n\nMr. Lyons\n\nWitness Statement - 10 September 2008\n\nSecond Witness Statement - 30 October 2009\n\nRebuttal [3rd] Witness Statement - 14 April 2010\n\nFourth Witness Statement - 16 May 2014\n\nFifth Witness Statement - 13 October 2014\n\nMr. Figuera\n\nDirect Testimony - 20 July 2009\n\nSupplemental Direct Testimony - 26 January 2010\n\nSecond Supplemental Direct Testimony - 17 May 2010\n\nThird Supplemental Direct Testimony - 15 August 2014\n\nFourth Supplemental Direct Testimony - 7 January 2015 (For the purposes of this Award, the term \"Direct\" will not be used.)\n\nAll other witness statements will be mentioned where appropriate.\n\n65.\n\nIn respect of the contributions of Mr. Lyons and Mr. Figuera, which are of particular relevance to the quantum phase, the Tribunal notes at the outset that their views do not in all cases reflect direct personal knowledge relating to the conduct and operation of the Projects, given the fact that they were exercising responsibilities only during a part of the period when the facts relevant to the matter to be examined by the Tribunal occurred.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal has also received a great number of reports prepared by the Parties' respective experts.\n\n67.\n\nSome of these reports were focusing on issues related to production (upstream, on-stream, and downstream) and on a number of technical items. The main expertise in this category was authored by Mr. Jes\u00fas Rafael Pati\u00f1o Murillo, presented by the Respondent; the reports submitted by this expert are the following:\n\nExpert Report - 18 August 2014\n\nSecond Expert Report - 7 January 2015\n\nConsolidated Expert Report - 17 October 2016\n\nThe reports provided by Mr. Pati\u00f1o have been reviewed and addressed by two of the Claimants' experts. Dr. Richard F. Strickland submitted three reports:\n\nExpert Report - 13 October 2014\n\nSecond Expert Report - 21 April 2016\n\nConsolidated Expert Report - 17 October 2016\n\nMr. Neil K. Earnest (Muse, Stancil & Co.) provided the following reports:\n\nTechnical Assessment of the Hamaca and Petrozuata Upgrader Performance - 13 October 2014 Consolidated Expert Report - 17 October 2016\n\n68.\n\nA second category of experts' reports relates to the calculation of oil production and of the damages in dispute, both items being covered by the term \"valuation\".\n\nFor the Claimants, a series of reports have been submitted by Dr. Manuel A. Abdala and Professor Pablo T. Spiller, Directors of former LECG, LLC, today Compass Lexecon. They are:\n\nPreliminary Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 12 September 2008\n\nSecond Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 2 November 2009\n\nRebuttal Report to Respondent's Experts' Second Reports, 15 April 201011\n\nDamages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2014\n\nDamages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, Supplemental Report, 13 October 2014\n\nMarch 2016 Update, 18 March 2016\n\nRebuttal Report, 21 April 2016\n\nConsolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016\n\nReport on the Project-Specific Country Risk Applicable to the Claimants' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2017\n\nFor the Respondent, an equally important number of reports have been presented by Mr. Vladimir Brailovsky and Dr. Daniel Flores. They are:\n\nExpert Report on the Discount Rate to be Applied to Projected Cashflows, 24 July 2009\n\nSecond Expert Report on the Discount Rate to be Applied to Projected Cash Flows, 1 February 2010\n\nReply to LECG's Rebuttal to Second Discount Rate Report, 17 May 201012\n\nExpert Report on Valuation, 18 August 2014\n\nExpert Report on the Theoretical and Historical Foundations of the Compensation Provisions, 18 August 2014\n\nSecond Expert Report on Valuation, 7 January 2015\n\nValuation Update, 18 March 2016\n\nValuation Update Reply, 21 April 2016\n\nConsolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016\n\nAdditional Expert Report on Country Risk in Discount Rate, 19 May 2017\n\nAll other expert reports filed with the Tribunal will be mentioned where appropriate.\n\nThe first three of these reports had also as author Mr. Jos\u00e9 Alberro.\n\nThese first three reports have been prepared by Mr. Brailovsky and Professor Louis T. Wells.\n\n69.\n\nUpon request, the Parties have filed their submissions on Costs on 16 April 2018, which were followed by the Claimants' rebuttal dated 3 May 2018 and two letters in reply from the Respondent, dated 18 April and 3 May 2018. The Claimants submitted an update by letter dated 17 September 2018.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal declared the proceeding closed on 8 February 2019.\n\n**V. The Applicable Law Governing Remedy**\n------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe natural remedy for the Claimants' compensation of their damages suffered as a consequence of an expropriation of the three Projects is to be found in the BIT or in the applicable law to which this Treaty refers. Article 9 of the BIT is therefore the first source of law to be considered (A). In relation to the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects, great emphasis has been put, since the beginning of this proceeding, on the alleged relevance of the compensation provisions contained in the respective Association Agreements. The potential impact of these provisions as remedies for the Projects' expropriation needs to be clarified (B). Finally, the Tribunal must determine whether the standard of compensation is contained in the BIT, and in Article 6(c) in particular, or whether general or customary international law is to be applied (C).\n\nA. Article 9 of the BIT\n-----------------------\n\n72.\n\nAt the outset of this analysis, two provisions of Article 9 of the BIT have to be examined more closely. The first one is paragraph 3 on the possible scope *ratione materiae* of a Tribunal's award on the merits. This provision reads as follows:\n\n3. The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of obligations has caused damages to the national concerned, and, if such is the case, the amount of compensation.\n\n73.\n\nThe second one is the last part of Article 9, paragraph 5:\n\n5. The arbitral award shall be based on:\n\n- the law of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n- the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments;\n\n- the general principles of international law;\n\n- such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties to the dispute.\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants submit that under Article 9(5) of the BIT, only customary international law governs the consequences of Venezuela's illegal expropriation, requiring full reparation. On the other hand, Venezuela contends that any award in this case must take into account Venezuelan law, including the terms and conditions of the special agreements relating to the Projects and their compensation provisions. Venezuela so argues on the basis of Article 9(5) of the BIT. Venezuela avers that the Claimants have \"simply ignored\" Venezuelan law.\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimants explain that Article 9(5) does no more than confirm that the Tribunal must consider different sets of rules for different sets of issues in dispute. This provision is not an express choice-of-law clause; its reference to domestic law cannot be construed as requiring its application to the determination of every issue that arises before the Tribunal.\n\n76.\n\nVenezuela's invocation of \"the law of the Contracting Party concerned\" is therefore misplaced, because the issue for determination in this quantum phase must be adjudicated solely in accordance with international law. State responsibility entails a secondary obligation of full reparation. This principle was codified in Article 32 of the ILC Articles.\n\n77.\n\nThe authorities referred to by Venezuela in its Counter-Memorial on Quantum are of no moment here. The only relevant question is whether Venezuela may be allowed to rely on its own domestic law, to reduce its responsibility under international law. In sum, the authorities cited by Venezuela contradict its allegation that the consequences following Venezuela's Treaty breach should be determined by reference to domestic law instruments such as the Congressional Authorizations.\n\n78.\n\nThe *Mobil* Tribunal had no difficulty in rejecting the same argument on the basis of the same Treaty provision13. It stated that a party may not invoke its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. International obligations cannot be discarded on the grounds of national law. The *Mobil* Tribunal had no doubt that the Award must be governed by international law. Consequently, the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions cannot exempt or excuse the Respondent from its obligations under the Treaty or under customary international law. Bearing this in mind, the *Mobil* Tribunal considered the effect of the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions of the Cerro Negro Framework Conditions in the section on quantum.\n\n*Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro Negro Holdings, Ltd., et al. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award of 9 October 2014 (CL-348). On this point, the Claimants refer to paras. 224 and 225 of the Award (Claimants' Reply on Quantum, para. 39). These paragraphs, among others, have been annulled by the Decision on Annulment, dated 9 March 2017, para. 196(3) (R-658).\n\n79.\n\nIn addition, the Association Agreements do not even come within the terms of Article 9(5). For a domestic law contract potentially to affect the international law rights of investors, it is axiomatic that the contract must be between those same investors and that same respondent State. It stands to reason that the contracts on which the Tribunal can \"base\" its award under Article 9(5) must also be between the State and the investor. In sum, customary international law governs quantum in this case, and Venezuela's invocation of Article 9(5) of the Treaty does nothing to change that.\n\n*2. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Congressional Authorizations and the Association Agreements are to be taken into account and given effect in determining quantum under Article 9(5) of the BIT, which refers to the law of the Contracting Party concerned and the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimants argue that because the issue is full reparation, the only relevant law is international law. This argument is nothing more than an invitation to the Tribunal to ignore the applicable law provisions of the Treaty. The Claimants seem to be under the mistaken impression that international law can be applied in the abstract without consideration of national law. The Treaty calls for compensation based on fair market value, but fair market value is not a concept divorced from the underlying rights being valued, which themselves cannot be separated from whatever limitations may be attached to them. The concept of reparation is not independent of the terms and conditions applicable to the specific investments at issue.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that Article 9(3) of the BIT prevents this Tribunal from awarding damages beyond those caused by a breach of the BIT. In the case of a failure to pay the required compensation, the only damage is the amount of compensation due as of the date of expropriation, plus interest.\n\n83.\n\nIn other words, giving effect to the governing law provisions of Article 9(5) of the Dutch Treaty and applying the compensation mechanisms is not only a requirement of the Dutch Treaty itself, but is consistent with, and an integral part of, the international law analysis that the Claimants want this Tribunal to apply pursuant to the *Chorz\u00f3w* decision. It is worth noting that it is universally recognized that the nature and scope of property rights are defined by local law, not international law. The issue here is not whether the consequences of an internationally wrongful act should be determined by international or national law. It is the scope of rights that the Claimants had. That is determined by national law, in this case starting with the Congressional Authorizations. The Claimants cannot circumvent the terms and conditions upon which they were permitted to invest in Venezuela. They must be given effect and they determine the basis of compensation.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants further invoke the well-known principle that a State may not use its internal law to extricate itself from an international responsibility. It is one of the principles the Claimants invoke which has nothing to do with the facts of the case. This is not a case in which the Respondent is relying upon subsequently enacted legislation as a defense to an international law claim. Rather, the Respondent is relying upon the terms and conditions established at the outset of the upgrading Projects pursuant to the Congressional Authorizations, which set forth the terms and conditions under which the Claimants would be entitled to invest in Venezuela. The issue can be stated as follows: if the terms and conditions of an investment are that the State would be entitled to capture, for instance, windfall profits through taxation, can the principle that a State may not use its internal law to extricate itself from international responsibility apply to prevent the State from exercising that right when the windfall profits subsequently materialize? The answer must be \"no\". Yet that is what the Claimants try to do. They have not been able to refute any part of the extensive documentary record establishing the State's ability as owner of the resource to obtain the benefit of exceptional profits.\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the wording and the list set out in paragraph 5 of Article 9 of the BIT do not establish any order of priority among the five sources of law that are mentioned. The provision contains an enumeration, without any hierarchy. When considered as a rule on the applicable law, or on conflicts of law, the rule has its own limitations: it determines the possible applicable sources of law, but it does not determine which one is applicable in a particular context that is relevant for rendering the award.\n\n86.\n\nOne of the effects of this characteristic of Article 9(5) of the BIT is that the potential scope of application of one or another of the enumerated sources of law, for itself or in comparison to the others, has to be determined by reference to the scope of application of each one of these sources. Article 9(5) does not provide an answer to this question.\n\n87.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention is in harmony with such understanding. Pursuant to this provision, the Tribunal shall decide a dispute \"in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties\". Article 9(5) of the BIT constitutes such an agreement. The BIT is also in harmony with the second part of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, stating that in the absence of an agreement on the choice of applicable rules of law, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the host State \"and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" The ICSID Convention does not provide for any restriction in respect of these \"applicable rules of international law\"; they necessarily include all such rules which according to their self-determined scope of application cover the legal issue arising in a particular case.\n\n88.\n\nOne important factor of hierarchy is the principle that international law must prevail over domestic law, and that a State may not invoke its internal law to extract itself from an international law obligation. As a matter of principle, this is not disputed between the Parties, nor is there any controversy that such principle results from the international law itself and not from Article 9(5) of the BIT.\n\n89.\n\nThis principle of priority of international law over domestic law has its own limitations. International law does not prevail over national law in a matter not governed by international law, in which case national law may apply, in accordance with Article 9(5) of the BIT. The much-debated issue of the relevance of the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements goes to the heart of this question. Are these provisions capable of governing the effects of an expropriation of the participants' assets held in the Projects? Or are these provisions relevant to the determination of the assets subject to such an expropriation when considered in the framework of Article 6 of the BIT? These questions, together with others, will be examined more closely below.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal also observes that Article 9(3) of the BIT does not support the Respondent's interpretation that no damages other than those provided by the Treaty can be awarded. This provision states that the Tribunal's award shall not determine breach beyond the \"obligations under this Agreement\". Thus, while the range of obligations to be taken into account is limited by the content of the BIT, such limitation is not attached to the terms of \"damages\" and \"amount of compensation\" contained in the same provision.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the BIT has to be interpreted in light of the rules set out in the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969. Article 31 \u00a7 3(c) of this Treaty indicates that account is to be taken of \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\". The Tribunal must certainly be mindful of the BIT's special purpose as a Treaty promoting foreign investments, but it cannot apply the BIT in a vacuum, without taking the relevant rules of international law into account. Article 9(5) of the BIT has to be construed in harmony with such rules.\n\nB. The Compensation Provisions of the Association Agreements\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nCaptured in very summary terms, the debate between the Parties centers on whether the Association Agreements, relating, respectively, to the Petrozuata (C-21) and the Hamaca (C-22) Projects, are based on the implicit but nevertheless fundamental principle that the host State's ability to capture extraordinary profits must be preserved and whether in this respect the investors do not have an assurance that their revenue will never be affected. The marked difference with older State contracts in the field of petroleum extraction is that these Agreements do not contain a so called \"stabilization\" clause whereby the State accepts not to interfere with the legal and economic characteristics of the contract.\n\n93.\n\nThe compensation provisions contained in each of the Association Agreements represent a substitute for the full preservation of the host State's rights and policies14. In sum, these provisions provide that in case a \"Discriminatory Action\" (\"DA\") is taken by the State that causes a significant loss to the foreign investors, compensation must be provided to them. This compensation, however, is not due by the State, but by PDVSA or its relevant subsidiary, a company under the State's control. The amount of the compensation is calculated on the basis of a complex formula, which under the prevailing oil prices resulted in a sum of approximately 25 US$ or 27 US$ per barrel, respectively. The payment was to be made through the regular terms of provision of dividends to the shareholders. The Hamaca Association Agreement contains an additional layer in providing for a \"buy-out\" in case the parties cannot agree on whether a discriminatory action has occurred or the amendments to be agreed upon (Art. 14.4). Since the very beginning of this proceeding, the Parties have been deeply divided in their respective understanding of the content and effects of these compensation provisions (also called \"Discriminatory Action provisions\" or \"DA provisions\") in the present case, and this in particular in respect of their application to the consequences of an expropriation governed by the BIT.\n\nArticles 9.07 for Petrozuata (C-21, R-22) and 14 for Hamaca (C-22, R-26).\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimants object to Venezuela's main line of argument that the Discriminatory Action provisions in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements somehow limit the compensation resulting from Venezuela's liability under international law for its expropriation of these Projects, although Venezuela was not a party to these Agreements.\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimants submit that domestic law is irrelevant to the standard of compensation for a violation of international law. Article 9(5) of the BIT does not provide otherwise; it simply sets out the different sources of law that a tribunal might apply to different issues. The issues of State responsibility here attract the rules of international law. The Association Agreements do not affect Venezuela's obligations under international law. There is nothing in these contracts showing any \"cap\" on the value of the Projects. On the contrary, the DA provisions serve as an additional form of protection that served to enhance the value of the Associations.\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimants are investors and therefore entitled to the benefit of the Treaty's substantive protections. Thus, the Claimants' claims must be assessed and valued under the Treaty and international law. Potential contractual causes of action are separate and distinct from Treaty claims. They cannot diminish the quantification of damages under international law. In the present case, Venezuela was not a party to the Agreements. A fortiori, these Agreements can neither remove nor limit the Venezuelan State's liability under international law.\n\n97.\n\nThe Congressional Authorizations confirm the irrelevance of the discriminatory action provisions. These Authorizations provide that the Agreements will not restrict Venezuela's sovereign rights. One of those rights was the right to grant binding protections to foreign investors by Treaty or by legislation (here the investment law).\n\n98.\n\nThe Claimants explain that the DA provisions include three basic propositions: (a) First, when a DA occurs, the Claimants must, to the extent practicable, pursue remedies against the governmental actor responsible for the DA, including actions for monetary damages against the State. (b) Second, the relevant PDVSA subsidiaries are contractually obliged to indemnify the Claimants for harm resulting from the DA, with the indemnity being limited under certain oil price scenarios. (c) Third, to avoid double recovery, if the Claimants obtain payment from the relevant governmental actor, they must provide an offset to the PDVSA subsidiaries through an appropriate credit or reimbursement.\n\n99.\n\nThe DA provisions evidence that they are irrelevant to the compensation owed by Venezuela under international law for the taking of the Claimants' investments. They are partial contractual indemnities payable by PDVSA affiliates. They do not purport to address Venezuela's obligations for its own wrongful conduct. They do not limit the profits of any Project participant, nor do they impose any limit on the fair market value of the Claimants' project interests.\n\n100.\n\nVenezuela has avoided looking at the plain terms of the DA provisions and has instead relied on the negotiating history. The contractual text is the best evidence of the parties' agreement. The DA provisions expressly recognize the Claimants' rights and require the pursuit of those remedies that are available under the circumstances. Even if this Tribunal were to consider pre-contractual negotiating history, the DA provisions do not contain a value-cap on the State's liability under international law.\n\n101.\n\nAll of the Claimants' witnesses called at the August 2016 hearing confirmed their understanding of the three-pronged structure of the DA provisions as outlined above. Venezuela has failed to put forward a single witness who was involved in negotiating the Association Agreements. The sole witness appearing on behalf of Venezuela, Dr. Mommer, played no role in these negotiations.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants have never argued that Venezuela lacked the \"sovereign power\" to expropriate. The question is whether the DA provisions say anything about Venezuela's obligations under international law with respect to that power. They do not.\n\n103.\n\nMoreover, the DA provisions of the Association Agreements provide for ICC arbitration. The ICC Arbitral Tribunal seized with the matter had to determine how the Discriminatory Action provisions have to be applied, and whether Venezuela's unlawful expropriation falls within the ambit of those clauses. Venezuela has denied that they cover the expropriation or other challenged measures. This ICSID Tribunal, however, has exclusive jurisdiction over Venezuela's breach of the Treaty.\n\n104.\n\nThe DA provisions add value to the Associations because they provide for an additional layer of protection, above and beyond the remedies against the State expressly envisaged in the DA provisions. Venezuela argues that a willing buyer of the Claimants' interests would value future cash flows under the assumption that the State would take all cash flows beyond the indemnity limits in the DA provisions. Accordingly, says the Respondent, the fair market value of the Claimants' project interests is limited by the DA provisions.\n\n105.\n\nEven if one were to assume that the DA provisions somehow cap the value of the Associations, the only way such a cap could be imposed would be if the Claimants were deemed to have waived their rights to full reparation under international law. The fact is that the Claimants have important international law rights against the State that were in no way waived, modified or limited by the Association Agreements, to which the State is not even a party. Those provisions did not purport to relieve the State of its own legal responsibility or to waive any otherwise applicable international law restrictions on the State's ability to take away an investment.\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimants also observe that Venezuela misconstrues the negotiation history of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements. First, the *condiciones* in the Congressional Authorizations did not require a waiver of remedies against the State under international law. Each Authorization established only a non-exhaustive general framework for items to be addressed in each Association Agreement. Second, the ConocoPhillips parties were not negotiating with the State and hence were not agreeing to any limitations of the State's potential liability. Their access was limited to representatives of Maraven and Corpoven. Accordingly, those discussions can only have related to the rights and obligations between contractual parties. Third, there is no support for Venezuela's assertion that Conoco was seeking compensation \"from the Government\" via the Petrozuata Authorization, rather than from the PDVSA subsidiary Maraven. Mr. Griffith's reply letter of 17 September 1992 (R-97) addressed the proposed compensation that would be owed by Maraven. Fourth, the operative provisions of the Association Agreements were limited to the reciprocal rights and obligations of the parties to those Agreements. PDVSA and its subsidiaries were authorized to agree to take some degree of indemnity upon themselves. They could not and did not purport to agree to impose obligations on the State; that matter was outside the scope of the Agreements and was governed by other sources of State obligations, including international law. Fifth, the parties added provisions that were not dictated by the Congressional Authorizations, like the \"sliding scale\" compensation mechanism. The ConocoPhillips parties sought the most robust indemnities they could get, while their counterparts sought to narrow the indemnities. At the end, the Association Agreements provided for partial indemnification by the contracting PDVSA affiliate in the event of certain governmental actions whose damage exceeded specified thresholds. In sum, the terms of the Association Agreements do not purport to affect any obligations the State had, or might assume in the future, under international law, or in Venezuela's statutory or constitutional law. Nor is there any indication that the Discriminatory Action provisions were *in lieu* of otherwise applicable State liability. They were providing an additional layer of protection for the investors.\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Discriminatory Action provisions were intended to serve as limited insurance policies underwritten by the contracting PDVSA subsidiaries - not as a waiver of the ConocoPhillips Parties' rights in that regard. The Association Agreements provide for a contractual indemnity against the contracting PDVSA subsidiary for measures taken by the State. This indemnity is subordinated to whatever relief the Claimants may obtain in any other competent fora against the State. Venezuela is not a party to the Association Agreement. The Congressional Authorizations confirm it expressly when reserving the sovereign powers of the State. Venezuela cannot claim to be a third-party beneficiary. This is precisely how similar provisions have been interpreted by the ICSID Tribunal in *Mobil v. Venezuela* (CL-348). The Tribunal noted that the Agreement limits the compensation due by PDVSA, a limitation reflected in the amount to be awarded by the ICC tribunal. No such limitation applies, however, to the State's responsibility under the BIT.\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimants also reject Venezuela's speculative claim that, in the absence of the expropriation, the Government would have \"in all probability\" taxed the Projects so as to capture all profits above the contractual price caps. This argument is illogical and without legal basis. It is no more than a recasting of Venezuela's main argument that the Association Agreements have the effect of a waiver of the Claimants' international law right to claim against the State, at least in respect of other than \"normal\" profits.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal has held in its 2013 Decision and in its 2017 Interim Decision that Venezuela violated the Treaty by taking the Claimants' investments. It follows necessarily that they must be awarded full reparation for their losses - which is not what the Discriminatory Action provisions provide. Even if that were not so, those provisions do not afford any right to Venezuela or limit its liability for breaches of the Treaty.\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimants also object to Venezuela's assertion that even if the standard of full reparation applies, the Tribunal must take into account \"the terms of the investment\". The only cash flows that the Claimants could have expected to earn absent the expropriation would have been those below vague \"exceptional\" or \"windfall\" thresholds. The argument is circular. Only if Venezuela's argument was well founded - *i.e.* if the Association Agreements had allocated to the State all cash flows above an \"exceptional\" level - could one conclude that the Claimants' entitlement could be cut off at that level. If the Association Agreements do not extinguish the Claimants' right to full reparation under the standard of international law, then they cannot either affect the calculation of full reparation.\n\n111.\n\nFinally, even if one were to assume that the DA provisions somehow serve as a cap on Venezuela's liability under the Treaty and international law, such limitation could not be operative here, because a party engaging in willful misconduct cannot claim the benefit of alleged contractual limitations on liability. Rather, under Venezuelan law, this party must pay all direct and consequential damages stemming from its conduct. Thus, even if Venezuela were hypothetically assumed to have stepped into the shoes of the parties to the Association Agreements, it would remain fully liable to the Claimants.\n\n112.\n\nVenezuela cannot be allowed to benefit from any limitations on liability in the Association Agreements without also being subject to the laws that govern any such limitations. In all events, having willfully breached its international obligations, Venezuela cannot claim the benefit of any restriction of its liability under international law. For all these reasons, the Claimants are entitled to full reparation for the takings in accordance with international law. The Association Agreements and the DA provisions do not undermine or limit that clear entitlement.\n\n*2. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent's analysis starts by affirming that the threshold question to be decided by this Tribunal is whether a State has the right to determine the terms and conditions upon which it will accept investments in its territory. The Respondent's basic position is that the investment in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects included the reservation by the State of its full sovereign pow-ers15 to take action affecting the Projects, and that compensation for such sovereign action would be provided by the State company partner in the Projects. Compensation for governmental action was to be on \"equitable\" terms and subject to a cap on \"excess\" or \"exceptional\" or \"windfall\" profits generated by high oil prices, which the State was entitled to take for itself as the \"owner of the resource\".\n\nBased on Article 320 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (R-16) and Article 5 of the Organic Law that Reserves to the State the Industry and Trade of Hydrocarbons, dated 21 August 1975 (C-6, R-19).\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is faced with extremely lengthy and repeated explanations provided by the Respondent. For the purposes of this Award, the presentation of the Respondent's position must focus on those facts and arguments that are relevant for the Tribunal's understanding and its analysis of the pertinent questions requiring a solution. In order to remain faithful to the Respondent's presentation, the Tribunal retains the division based on each Project's historical evolution, referring as well to the summaries contained in the 2013 Decision.\n\na. The Petrozuata Project\n-------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that the Sixteenth Condition of the Congressional Authorization (R-21/92) addressed the precise manner in which the foreign partner would be \"compensated\" while at the same time reserving to the State its sovereign powers. The use of the word \"compensate\" in the Petrozuata Authorization is telling. This is the issue in this case, not \"insurance\" as the Claimants say. The Claimants understood full well that they were without any international recourse against the State (no BIT was applicable at that time) and they have admitted this point on several occasions during the course of this Arbitration. That is why during the negotiations they pressed Maraven for as much protection as possible.\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimants went into the Petrozuata Project understanding that they had no international remedy against the State and that their sole and exclusive remedy for adverse governmental action would be the compensation provisions. It would make no sense for the Government to insist on limited compensation from the State company but full compensation from the State itself.\n\n117.\n\nThe 17 September 1992 letter from Conoco's Mr. Griffith (R-97) commented on the draft of the conditions to be incorporated in the Petrozuata Authorization. The letter requested provisions of full compensation based on market value, an economic stability clause, and precisions on how Conoco's assets and interests will be valued and reimbursed in the event of nationalization. In response, only one change was made to the draft of Clause Sixteen, *i.e.* the inclusion of the language at the end, reserving the State's sovereign power16. Witness McKee testified that Conoco did not obtain anything it requested in the letter17.\n\nCf. Report of Bicameral Commission dated 12 August 1993 (R-167, C-8); and further a presentation to the Senate (R-393) and a letter of the President of Maraven to the Permanent Commission on Energy and Mines dated 13 February 1996 (R-394).\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 3, p. 712:6-16; 2016 August Hearing, Day 1, p. 282:5-285:13, 291:9-293:19.\n\n118.\n\nIn its 16 September 1993 letter (R-100) Conoco wanted the key definition of Discriminatory Legislation (which ultimately became \"Discriminatory Actions\") to cover virtually all governmental action adversely affecting the Project. With respect to compensation, Conoco again sought full compensation, so as to restore the relevant Class B Shareholder's income to where it would have been had there been no Discriminatory Action. Conoco did not get it.\n\n119.\n\nThe Minutes of the Miami Negotiating Sessions which took place in November and December 1993 reveal that the question which was discussed was what would be the mechanism that would implement the notion of \"equitable\" compensation while allowing the State to capture what were considered to be windfall profits (R-395).\n\n120.\n\nThe January 1994 Conoco Venezuela Strategy Management Team Report (C-67) clearly expressed Conoco's understanding of the risks of the Petrozuata Project, of the fact that governmental measures were likely to be adopted in high price scenarios, and of the likelihood that the Government would place a ceiling on project economics. Witness McKee explained that they never expected that a country like Venezuela would not have the power to increase its take18; they believed in the sovereign rights of a country19. Thus, Mr. McKee not only acknowledged such expectation, he actually endorsed the concept20.\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 3, p. 727:6-16.\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 3, p. 739:13-17.\n\nMr. McKee also said that Conoco's \"hurdle rate\" for the project was 20% (*ibidem*, TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 3, p. 731:8-15, 732:8-17). Within this limit, it was recognized that the State would be expected to increase government take. To do that, it was necessary to assure that cash flows from the Project up to a certain level would be protected from governmental action.\n\n121.\n\nIn February 1994, Conoco presented a detailed \"sliding scale\" proposal setting forth a compensation mechanism tied to the average price of Brent crude oil (R-101). The proposal was a follow-up to the discussions two months earlier in Miami.\n\n122.\n\nThe April 1994 Steering Committee Presentation confirms that Conoco understood well that the State was entitled to take governmental action that would affect project economics, and that Conoco's protection had to be provided through provisions for the granting of compensation by Maraven and that Conoco would not receive the \"full compensation\" it had sought from the outset of the negotiations. Given the lack of an \"economic stability clause\", Conoco was exposed to changes in the law that could have an adverse impact on the economics of the Project. Slide 8 identified the issue as \"Gov't can take away economics\" (R-102).\n\n123.\n\nThe February 1995 internal communication to the Conoco Management Committee once again highlighted the risk that the \"government may radically change taxes, exchange rules and rates, or other features of our basic terms which could render our venture uneconomic\" (R-397). The document noted that the risk of governmental action was being addressed by \"seeking contractual terms which will help protect non-Venezuelan investors\".\n\n124.\n\nThe PDVSA March 1995 Strategic Business Committee Presentation (R-219) reported Conoco's position as follows: \"the owner of the resource must be able to obtain the benefit of exceptional profits\". It is noted that the current compensation scheme (sliding scale) allows a gradual recognition of exceptional profits to the owner of the resource. Conoco's internal documents confirmed the company's view that a \"large portion of the taxation risk has been eliminated by contractual provisions that require Mareven to offset Conoco's losses from discriminatory treatment\" (R-398/397).\n\n125.\n\nThe Petrozuata Offering Circular dated 17 June 1997 (C-75) that by its nature is presumed to be accurate, does not highlight that \"full compensation\" from the State was available; it describes in detail the compensation provisions. There is nothing to support the Claimants' interpretation of the mechanism as a \"partial insurance policy\".\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimants say nothing about Dr. Mommer's testimony concerning the compensation mechanisms established for the upgrading Projects. His testimony is consistent with the full record. In his second supplemental direct testimony he recalled that the essence of the concept they discussed within PDVSA was defining what constitutes \"normal profit\", and what was \"excess\" or \"windfall\" profit. The Claimants did not impeach Dr. Mommer on the subject of the compensation provisions at the 2010 hearing. Personally, Dr. Mommer considered such clauses as a circumvention of the condition that the Projects should not in any way restrict the sovereign power of the State. He resigned from PDVSA over this disagreement in January 1995. The well-recognized feature for the delivery of compensation for adverse governmental action was also explained by Professor Sornarajah and Professor Wells21.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to Thomas W. Waelde/George Ndi, Stabilizing International Investment Commitments: International Law Versus Contract Interpretation, Texas International Law Journal 31 (1996) p. 215-267 (R-220).\n\nb. The Hamaca Project\n---------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe basic legal terms were set forth in the Nineteenth Condition of the Hamaca Congressional Authorization (R-93, C-132), making clear that the Project would impose no restrictions on the exercise of the State's sovereign powers.\n\n128.\n\nCompensation was provided in the Twenty-First Condition, providing that the foreign participants would be entitled to compensation from PDVSA's subsidiary, subject to the conditions and limitations established in the Agreement. This Condition was similar to the Sixteenth Condition of the Petrozuata Authorization (R-21/92), including the language reaffirming that the compensation mechanism would not in any way restrict the sovereign power of the Government to adopt any measure in the future.\n\n129.\n\nThe Twenty-First Condition also contained an additional provision relating to the buy-out option. It provided that in the event that the State company charged with the responsibility of providing the compensation for adverse governmental action did not agree with the amount of compensation determined, it would have the option to purchase the interest of the ConocoPhillips subsidiaries involved in the Hamaca Project at the formula price. The provision underscores that there would be an upper limit on compensation for adverse governmental action, ensuring that \"excess\" or \"exceptional\" or \"windfall\" profits resulting from high oil prices would inure to the benefit of the State.\n\n130.\n\nIn the present case, the material point is that the buy-out option required by the Twenty-First Condition of the Hamaca Authorization would undoubtedly be triggered by any finding of an arbitral tribunal that compensation was due for any of the governmental measures at issue in this case. Thus, PDVSA's subsidiary involved in the Hamaca Project would have the option to purchase the entirety of the ConocoPhillips subsidiaries' interests in the Project at the formula price, thereby precluding any possibility of recovery in excess of that amount.\n\n131.\n\nThe minutes of an early Corpoven-Arco Joint Study Agreement Steering Committee Meeting in February 1995 (R-107) confirm that the Congress has the power to enact new laws or to modify current laws. The minutes make clear that the State would be able to exercise its full sovereign powers. The investors were to be compensated for adverse governmental action by the State company, with any compensation being subject to the price cap formula to ensure that the State would remain entitled to capture windfall profits generated by high prices.\n\n132.\n\nThe concept of \"equitable\" compensation limited to protecting cash flows that would result from ordinary prices, but not extraordinary prices, was later incorporated into preliminary term sheets for the Hamaca Project, such as the term sheet dated 2 May 1996 (R-402). As in the case of all other documents in the record, the operative word was \"compensate\". The term sheet also recognized the inclusion of a buy-out option under \"equitable conditions\".\n\n133.\n\nA flow chart from a Corpoven April 1996 presentation entitled \"Terms and Conditions of the Arco-Corpoven Association\" (R-405) illustrates the operation of the compensation arrangements. The chart shows that the legal actions against the governmental measures, *i.e.* remedies to obtain the revocation of the measures, were only the first step in the chain that would lead ultimately either to the acceptance of the compensation determined by the arbitral tribunal or a buyout at the formula price. In that manner, the State ensured that the limitation on compensation based on the price cap would be respected.\n\n134.\n\nThe Phillips' May 1996 internal presentation to its own senior management contained a slide confirming its understanding of the issue of fiscal stabilization (C-110, p. 43). Nothing could be clearer on the issue of fiscal stability than the words: \"No stability clause\". Witnesses Goff22, Appel23 and Sheets24 confirmed that there was no such clause.\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 3, p. 619:1-12.\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 4, p. 925:1-6, 933:3-7; 2016 August Hearing, Day 1, p. 244:10-14.\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 6, p. 1568:8-1571:12.\n\n135.\n\nSince the Hamaca Project enjoyed no stability guarantees from the State, the parties focused on designing compensation provisions that would address the adverse economic consequences of State action. In a 29 May 1996 letter to Corpoven, Arco abandoned the idea of stabilization after Corpoven had stated that it would have problems getting such protections through the current Congressional approval process (R-403). The draft discrimination provision attached to the letter made clear that there would be no obligation to compensate in case a \"windfall tax\" was imposed at a time when the price of oil exceeded a certain threshold.\n\n136.\n\nIn a 17 June 1999 internal memorandum, Mr. Bowerman advised the Phillips' Management Committee that President Ch\u00e1vez was authorized to reform the Income Tax Law and impose taxes on banking transactions (LECG-65). He knew that there was \"no stability clause\" for the Hamaca Project and that the Government expressly retained all of its sovereign powers to adopt measures pursuant to the Constitution and applicable laws.\n\n137.\n\nA Hamaca Information Memorandum shows that the Hamaca partners were considering approaching the Government for a tax stabilization clause under the Investment Law of 1999 (C101). No tax stabilization agreement was ever made or even sought.\n\n138.\n\nAs in the case of the Petrozuata Project, the record shows that the legal negotiation centered around the definition of \"windfall\" profits that the State would be entitled to capture. With the experience of that Project in mind, the discussions concentrated on the concept of a protected annual cash flow based on a price cap. The parties settled on a US$ 27 per barrel threshold (in 1996 dollars), to be escalated in accordance with inflation, as defining the border between \"normal\" and \"windfall\" profits, with no compensation being payable for governmental action capturing \"windfall\" profits resulting from price increases above that level. This point is illustrated in a summary of the parties' positions during the negotiation (R-392) and in a flow chart presented by Corpoven in 1996 (R-405).\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that the U.S. Embassy reported in May 2006 that according to a partner in a Venezuelan law firm, the strategic associations do not have a legal basis to fight the income tax increases or the new extraction tax (R-350). For the protection from tax increases, each of the agreements has some form of indemnity clauses. However, in order to receive payment, a certain level of economic damage must occur. Unfortunately, the formulas that are used assume low oil prices. Due to current high oil prices, it is unlikely that the increases will result in enough damage to reach the threshold where PDVSA has to pay the partners. The Respondent assumes that the lawyer in question was Ms. Eljuri, ConocoPhillips' own lawyer in Venezuela. The cable demonstrates, first, that the Claimants always knew that the terms and conditions of their investments in the upgrading Projects included the sovereign right of the State to take measures affecting project economics, with compensation to be limited to \"normal\" profits defined by applying a price cap. Second, the cable explains the operation of the compensation mechanisms for the upgrading Projects; the Claimants have declined to comment on the substance of the cable, beyond arguing that the cable was \"irrelevant\", \"hearsay\" and \"inadmissible\". The Claimants seem to think that the cable is irrelevant because it is referring to the Mobil's contractual claim for damages in the ICC arbitration against PDVSA. However, the cable says nothing about that arbitration but explains the operation of the compensation provisions of all the extra-heavy crude oil (\"EHCO\") upgrading Projects in the Orinoco Oil Belt. Thus, none of the Claimants' non-substantive arguments relating to those cables has any merit.\n\nc. The Claimants' legal arguments\n---------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nIn reply to a *first* argument raised by the Claimants, the Respondent admits that certain issues are governed by international law, but that does not mean that international law, including the Dutch Treaty, will not allow consideration of national law or the special agreements entered into regarding the investment in question. Thus, expropriation affects property rights, and those rights are defined by the local law under which they were created.\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Congressional Authorizations and the Association Agreements are to be taken into account and given effect in determining quantum under Article 9(5) of the Dutch Treaty, which refers to the law of the Contracting Party concerned and the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment. The concept of fair market value is not a concept divorced from the underlying rights being valued, which themselves cannot be separated from whatever limitations may be attached to them. The notion of reparation is not independent of the terms and conditions applicable to the specific investments at issue. In other words, giving effect to the governing law provisions of Article 9(5) of the Dutch Treaty and applying the compensation mechanisms is not only a requirement of the Dutch Treaty itself, but is consistent with, and an integral part of, the international law analysis that the Claimants want this Tribunal to apply pursuant to the *Chorz\u00f3w* decision.\n\n142.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates that the nature and scope of property rights are defined by local law, not international law. The scope of rights that the Claimants had is determined by national law, in this case starting with the Congressional Authorizations. The Claimants cannot circumvent the terms and conditions upon which they were permitted to invest in Venezuela. They must be given effect and they determine the basis of compensation.\n\n143.\n\nThe Claimants' *second* argument has nothing to do with the facts of the case. It may be true that a State cannot under international law eviscerate acquired rights through subsequent legislation and invoke its national law to such effect. But in this case, the rights acquired were from the outset subject to the State's ability to capture \"excess\" or \"windfall\" or \"exceptional\" profits. The Respondent is relying upon the terms and conditions established at the outset of the upgrading Projects pursuant to the Congressional Authorizations, which set forth the terms and conditions under which the Claimants would be entitled to invest in Venezuela.\n\n144.\n\nAs their *third* argument, the Claimants submit that they had never waived their international law rights. Therefore, the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements cannot deprive them from their entitlement to full compensation, even if this would include \"windfall\" or \"exceptional\" profits. For the Respondent, the concept of waiver is irrelevant in this case. One can only waive a right that one has. The rights the Claimants had were limited in nature. Article 2 of the Dutch Treaty contemplates that the State is entitled to establish the terms and conditions under which an investment would be admitted in its territory. The Claimants cannot resort to the concept of waiver to do away with those terms and conditions and expand the rights their affiliates acquired when they made the investment.\n\n145.\n\nThe notion that the Claimants were immune from governmental action capturing windfall profits cannot be based on any part of the record. The Claimants were only entitled to compensation in case the governmental measure encroached upon the level of protected cash flows measured by the formulas under the price caps. This is not a matter of waiver of an acquired right; it is one of defining the right that existed in the first place, as a party cannot waive a right it does not have.\n\n146.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that the Claimants (i) acknowledge that Venezuela had the right and discretion to define the terms and conditions upon which it admitted the investments and (ii) claim that the Respondent cannot \"seek refuge\" in those terms and conditions, which reserved for the State the right to take governmental action relating to the investments. One cannot acknowledge the right of the State to determine the conditions for the admission of an investment, and also invoke international law to take that same sovereign right away. None of the Claimants' cases refutes the fundamental point that the terms and conditions of an investment must be given effect. This is simply a matter of recognizing that a treaty claim is not divorced from the terms and conditions of an investment and that the property rights that are protected by a treaty are rights created and defined by national law. There is no basis either in national law or in international law for compensating a party for greater rights than it had or for ignoring limitations imposed on those rights as a condition for the admission of the investment. The Claimants have no answer to the evidence that the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects were authorized by Venezuela under specific terms and conditions. Those terms included the State's reservation of its full sovereign powers, with compensation to be provided by the State company subject to limits established by price caps. Under Article 2 of the Treaty, the Claimants cannot override those terms and conditions by invoking general principles of international law having nothing to do with this case.\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimants' *fourth* argument is that the Respondent cannot benefit from any limitation on liability because it was not a party to the Association Agreements nor can it step into the shoes of the PDVSA subsidiaries that are actually parties to the Association Agreements. The Claimants add that as a matter of Venezuelan contract law, a party who has acted in bad faith cannot invoke a contract limitation. This is irrelevant to the State's position. The issue is the fundamental condition on which the Projects were authorized and without which there would be no Projects at all. The State's position here is that of a regulator and owner of the natural resource, not a contracting party. The principle of compensation was explicitly recognized in the Congressional Authorizations, but such compensation was to be on \"equitable\" terms and conditions, which included the State's entitlement to capture through governmental action any \"excess\" or \"exceptional\" or \"windfall\" profits resulting from high oil prices. The Respondent asks this Tribunal to respect the terms and conditions under which the Projects were authorized. To do otherwise would be to give the Claimants the windfall they seek and to run afoul of the elementary principle that a party cannot be compensated for rights it never had.\n\n148.\n\nClaimants' also refer to the majority's decision on bad faith negotiation that somehow precludes the application of the terms and conditions on which the investments in the upgrading Projects were authorized. This is not a good point. In its 2013 Decision, the Tribunal expressly left open the issue of the relevance of the compensation provisions (para. 402). And the allegation of the Respondent's bad faith has been removed from the record by the Tribunal's conclusion in the 2017 Interim Decision.\n\n149.\n\nThe Claimants' *fifth* argument is that \"in all probability\" Venezuela would not have exercised its full right to tax profits generated by prices in excess of the price caps, and that, *sixth* point, they can disregard windfall profit taxes in their valuation. The Respondent observes that one can only wonder how anyone could truly believe that Venezuela would not have, if the nationalization had to be unwound, exercised its full sovereign authority to collect \"excess\" or \"exceptional\" or \"windfall\" profits through taxation. The exercise by Venezuela of its authority to enact measures to capture windfall profits was perfectly lawful. It would have been perfectly within its rights to tax all profits above those generated by the price caps in the case of the former Hamaca and Petro-zuata Projects had those Projects continued in the \"but-for\" world the Claimants hypothesize. The *Chorz\u00f3w* decision cannot be cited in support of insulating the concept of full reparation from any consideration which negatively affects value.\n\n150.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that any reasonable buyer of the Claimants' interests at the time of the expropriation would have done its due diligence on that issue and taken into account the State's power to capture windfall profits. Even when considered by reference to a later date, like the date of the award, the issue must naturally be raised of the probability that additional taxes would have been assessed at the earliest opportunity. It is obviously logical for a State to insist at the outset of a project that it wants to retain its full sovereign rights to capture windfall profits.\n\n151.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the testimony of Dr. Mommer and the entire history of the conduct of the Government starting in 2004, when there was a structural change in the international crude oil markets leading to an upward spiral in crude oil prices. In his first witness statement, Dr. Mom-mer made clear that the Government was reacting to the extraordinary increases in price. This explains why in October 2004, the royalty rate of 16%% was restored. It also appeared in 2005 and 2006 that the 34% income tax rate was no longer needed for the economic viability of the Projects. He argued for a 50% rate. Prices continued to increase. President Ch\u00e1vez then decided that an excess profit tax especially designed for very high prices should be introduced. If the decision to nationalize had not been made in 2006, additional taxes would have been adopted. It is thus clear that it was a virtual certainty, not just a probability, that the Government would have exercised its sovereign right to capture windfall profits from the Projects.\n\n152.\n\nVirtually all relevant authority makes clear that a tribunal may not disregard post-nationalization events when calculating value as of the award date. In this case, preserving the ability to capture windfall profits was precisely the objective of the Congressional Authorizations.\n\n153.\n\nIn the end, the Claimants reiterate their argument that the Respondent's principal submission is that the Agreements effect a waiver of the Claimants' international law rights to claim against the State, at least in respect of other than \"normal\" profits. The basic problem with this argument, says the Respondent, is that the concept of waiver is completely irrelevant to this case. The Claimants want this Tribunal to analyze this case as if it involved the waiver of acquired rights, because they know well that the record shows that they did not have the rights they now claim. If the Claimants never had the right to retain windfall profits resulting from high prices free from governmental interference, then there is no place for the argument of waiver or any of the authorities relevant to the waiver concept.\n\n154.\n\nThe conclusion from the Congressional Authorizations and compensation provisions is that the State, acting rationally, would have exercised its sovereign power to capture excess profits resulting from oil prices above those price caps. The Respondent had exercised that sovereign power on several occasions as prices began to rise starting in 2004, and it had every reason to continue doing so, as Dr. Mommer testified it would have done25.\n\nSecond Supplementary Testimony, para. 11.\n\n155.\n\nThe Claimants seek to insulate the post-nationalization changes from any negative postnationalization changes. An illustration is their approach with regard to the Venezuelan windfall profit taxes. The Claimants have sought to avoid the relevant fiscal regime applicable to their Project in an effort to inflate their calculation of damages. In the first phase, the Claimants challenged the 50% income tax rate and the 33 1/3% extraction tax/royalty that was in place at the time of the expropriation as violating their imaginary right to \"stabilization\" of the 1990s fiscal regime. That argument was rejected by the Tribunal. Now the Claimants seek to avoid the application of taxes on windfall profits that were enacted in the years following the expropriation.\n\n156.\n\nThe purpose of the analysis is to put the Claimants back into the position in which they would have been, in all probability, had the expropriation not occurred. That means that the Claimants would have continued engaging in the Projects under the terms of the Association Agreements and the Congressional Authorizations, subject to the State's express reservation of rights to enact measures, including taxes, affecting the Projects. The Claimants were thus entitled only to compensation for governmental measures up to the price caps specified in the Association Agreements. Thus, had the expropriation not occurred, the Claimants would have been subject to fiscal measures taken by the Government, including the windfall profits tax laws they now seek to disregard.\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe Parties' submissions on the pertinence of the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements address at length the Discriminatory Actions affecting ongoing Projects in taking away part of the participants' revenues. However, the primary focus in the present case should be on the impact of the expropriation that became effective on 26 June 2007.\n\n158.\n\nOne of the preliminary steps to be made in the analysis of pertinent issues is to set aside expressions not associated with a meaning or a definition. The Claimants' contention that they were entitled to \"full\" compensation does not, by itself, remove from the debate the effects to be given to the compensation provisions; it depends on what \"full\" should mean. Similarly, on the Respondent's side, there are, indeed, many indications that the Parties were to expect that \"Government will take away economics\", but such statement is of little guidance as long as the \"economics\" referred to are not identified. More particularly, the Respondent's position fails when it argues that, in the present case, the Government's expropriation had taken away such \"economics\" by terminating the Association Agreements in such a way that compensation should be based on provisions of these same Agreements that the Government decided to end and to which it has never been a party.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal will have to avoid being caught into ambiguities and polysemic wording. When the Respondent states that \"[its] first conclusion is that the Compensation Provisions formed the basis for providing compensation for governmental action agreed at the outset of the Upgrading Projects\"26, what does it mean precisely? What is the thought behind an assertion that \"this case involves the definition of the scope of the rights that were expropriated\"27? Does this mean that these provisions govern exclusively the admissibility and the effects of the expropriation, to the exclusion of any other remedy, be it domestic (Investment Law - C-1, R-12) or international (BIT)? Or does it mean that the compensation provisions govern the valuation of the economic earnings of the investing shareholders in case they are hit by a Discriminatory Action, with the effect that the same fixing of profit must be applied when considering the Claimants' compensation for the nationalization effective on 26 June 2007?\n\nRespondent's 2017 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 47. Similar or identical expressions are used frequently by the Respondent.\n\nRespondent's 2017 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 30.\n\na. The main elements and structure of the compensation provisions\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nAs a first step, the Tribunal must determine the meaning of \"Discriminatory Action\" in the framework of the compensation provisions. The definition of this concept is complex and different for each of the two Association Agreements. The elements of the definition are, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n161.\n\nThe *Petrozuata* Agreement provides in Section 1.01 that a:\n\n\"Discriminatory Action\" means any actions, decisions, or changes in law, adopted by national, state, or municipal, administrative, or legislative authorities, after a Development Decision has been made, which singly or in combination, result in unjust discriminatory treatment to the Company, any of its Shareholders... which are not applicable to all enterprises in Venezuela and which produce Significant Economic Damage to the Shareholders of the Company other than the Class A Privileged Shareholders28.\n\nHowever, under the same Section 1.01:\n\na treatment shall not be considered discriminatory if it \"equally applies to the enterprises within the oil industry in Venezuela, except that (1) with respect to the application of income taxes and any valuations as a basis for income taxes (e.g. the Fiscal Export Value), treatment shall be considered discriminatory if it is not generally applicable to most enterprises in Venezuela\".\n\nThis was the PDVSA subsidiary Maraven in the case of the Petrozuata Project.\n\n162.\n\n\"Significant Economic Damage\" was defined as the result of Discriminatory Actions during any fiscal year, which amounts to at least US$ 6.5 million (inflated from 1994 onwards) for all Class B Shareholders29. Such damage shall be determined by calculating any loan repayments or dividends that a Class B Shareholder would have otherwise received had no Discriminatory Action occurred.\n\nConoco Orinoco Inc.\n\n163.\n\nSection 9.07 then provides for the compensation that an \"Injured Shareholder\" will receive from the Class A Shareholder when it suffered in a given fiscal year significant economic damage as a result of any Discriminatory Action. The payment will be made from cash available to the company for the payment of dividends to the Class A Shareholder and the repayment of cash call loans (a). When the indexed price compared to the 1994 price of Brent crude oil was US$ 18.00 or less, 100% of the damages had to be compensated. If the yield was US$ 25.00 per barrel of Brent crude oil, no damage shall be compensated. For prices between these two amounts, damages were determined in proportion based on a formula also called \"sliding scale\" (b). In fact, the different ranges of the \"sliding scale\" are of no relevance for purposes of this Award given the fact that since the expropriation, prices were above US$25 per barrel, with the effect that an alternative price prevailed (on the hypothesis of damages greater than US$ 75 million in 1994 US$), providing for the payment of 25% of the actual damages suffered (c). It was further provided that the injured shareholder shall, to the fullest extent practicable, commence and exhaust all available legal and administrative actions which may provide a remedy from the application of any Discriminatory Action (d). In case of controversy, payment shall be postponed until an agreement was reached or such occurrence has been finally determined through an arbitral proceeding (f).\n\n164.\n\nWhile the policy behind the Hamaca compensation provision is the same as for the Petrozuata Project, the structure and the key elements of the legal framework are different. Section 14 of the Hamaca Association Agreement also takes as the starting point the occurrence of a Discriminatory Action (a). Such action may consist of a change of law, act of government or any other action or decision of a Venezuelan authority, which is (i) applicable to the Association, (ii) unjust and (iii) not generally applicable to entities engaged on their own behalf in the hydrocarbon industry in Venezuela (b).\n\n165.\n\nThe Hamaca Association Agreement further provides that in respect of tax rates, new taxes, financial burdens or charges for goods and services, foreign exchange controls \"or the expropriation of the assets of, or a Party's interest in, the Association or Association Entities\", such change of law or decision will be considered Discriminatory Actions if they are not generally applicable to corporations and other legal entities that are taxable in the same manner as corporations in Venezuela (b/1). Additionally, reductions or increases in the royalty rate applicable to the crude oil will not be considered as Discriminatory Actions \"unless such changes result in a royalty rate for the Parties in their capacity as participants in the Association, in excess of the maximum rate specified by law for the hydrocarbon industry in general\" (b/4).\n\n166.\n\nTo the extent that a foreign party suffers a reduction of more than five percent in any fiscal year in its reference net cash flow as the result of one or more Discriminatory Actions, the PDVSA subsidiary Corpoven Sub shall be required to compensate that party (Sec. 14.2(a)). The relevant factors are defined with great complexity. Referring to the Claimants' experts' presentation30, taken in its most simple terms, the main information is that a reference net cash flow of US$ 27 or more has to be taken into account since 2008. A reduction of more than 5% (US$ 1.35) then triggers Corpoven Sub's obligation to compensate. The damages of the affected party shall be equal to the amount in US$ needed for this party to attain the full reference net cash flow that this party would have attained in the relevant fiscal years had the Discriminatory Action not occurred, plus interest thereon at LIBOR, and increased by an amount taking account of the applicable taxes (Sec. 14.3(d)).\n\nAbdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, paras. 38-42.\n\n167.\n\nUpon notification by the foreign party to Corpoven Sub, negotiations may take place, including discussions about legal remedies (Sec. 14.3(a-c)). In the absence of an agreement on amendments to be concluded, each party is entitled to commence arbitration (Sec. 14.4(a)). If it is admitted that Discriminatory Actions resulted in a material adverse effect to a foreign party, the arbitral panel shall determine, in a second stage of the proceeding, the \"buy-out price\" (Sec. 14.4(b)), to be calculated either by reference to that party's net investment or to the commercial value of its project interest (Sec. 14.4(c)). If then the matter cannot be settled, one option would be that Corpoven Sub purchases the affected foreign party's project interest at the buy-out-price (Sec. 14.5(a-2)).\n\nb. The compensation provisions do not set the standard of compensation for the State's expropriation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent's main position is that the expropriation of the Claimants' interests embodied in the Association Agreements implies that the compensation they are entitled to receive must be determined in light of and is limited by the compensation provisions contained in these Agreements. The Claimants shall not, when invoking the BIT or customary international law, do away with the compensation regime they agreed to when entering into the Association Agreements prior to the date when the BIT became effective.\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is not seized with a claim for declaring that the provisions of the Association Agreements, applicable either to an expropriation or to its compensation, have been breached. The Claimants' request for relief is, in this respect, based on a claim for a declaration that the Respondent breached Article 6 of the BIT, and that the Tribunal must determine the damages resulting from such breach. The Claimants invoke international law and not the Association Agreements as the basis for their claim for damages.\n\n170.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal observes that the application of Article 6 of the BIT to the present dispute prevails over any Venezuelan domestic law on the same subject matter. A breach of Article 6 of the BIT is defined solely by this provision without any consideration of the domestic law of the host State. The same principle must necessarily apply to the compensation due as a consequence of an expropriation, notwithstanding what the applicable standard may be under domestic law. The standard of the BIT prevails over any standard the host State may claim to be applicable under its national law.\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent's position that the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements govern the economic consequences of the expropriation enforced on 26 June 2007 is not persuasive on the basis of the very terms and purposes of these provisions. An expropriation of the Project cannot be a \"Discriminatory Action\" within the meaning such term has in the compensation provi-sions31. For Petrozuata, such Discriminatory Action should follow a \"Development Decision\" (Sec. 1.01); such a decision has nothing in common with an expropriation. For Hamaca, such Action must be \"applicable to the Association\" (Sec. 14.1(b)) and affect net cash flow (Sec. 14.2(a)); the cash is no longer flowing when the Project ceases to exist. Similarly, the payment provisions make sense only in the case of the Projects' continued existence. In the case of Petrozuata, the compensation is paid through the provision of dividends, or out of general funds accumulating payments differed for later (Sec. 9.07). In the case of Hamaca, the notification by the foreign party of a material adverse effect caused by a Discriminatory Action is followed by negotiations directed toward the agreement of amendments to the parties' relation, which is therefore considered as being ongoing (Sec. 14.3(c)). If the affected party's claim is not withdrawn, its damages are to be paid out of Corpoven Sub's net cash flow from the Project (Sec. 14.5(a/1)) which therefore continues to exist. In case the parties were unable to agree upon modified terms of their agreement or to accept an arbitral decision, a by-out had to be triggered; however, in the case of an expropriation, the shares to be sold no longer exist.\n\nThe Respondent had explained that a change in operatorship and the restructuring caused by migration were not covered by the definition of Discriminatory Action; cf. Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, paras. 45, 278.\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent has relied on one sentence where the case of an expropriation is mentioned as an illustration of a Discriminatory Action. The Hamaca compensation provision refers, indeed, to \"the expropriation of the assets of, or a Party's interest in, the Association or Association Entities\" (Sec. 14.1(b/1)). However, these terms include only assets or interests as part of the Association. This expression, not contained in the Petrozuata Agreement, does not include the entire Project governed by the Association Agreement. Finally, the buy-out regime of the Association Agreement is based necessarily on the existence of an on-going Project, and completely incompatible with its taking by the Government through an expropriation.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted a debate between the Parties on whether the compensation provisions would govern an expropriation different from the one enforced through a single taking on 26 June 2007, consisting of an agglomerate of a number of Governmental actions, to be qualified together as Discriminatory Action, while certain of its components would, as such, not meet the conditions set in the pertinent definition. The Tribunal was told that the Parties had reached an agreement on the applicability of the compensation provisions in respect of an expropriation32. The Respondent further confirmed that this means that the compensation provisions apply to the expropriation \"in this case\"33 - this meaning \"exclusively\". This position does not reflect the Claimants' claim in the present case34. It can only relate to the dispute brought before the ICC Arbitration Tribunal. It is of no concern in the present case, where the expropriation at the origin of the dispute is the single taking of 26 June 2007 which led the Claimants to claim for a breach of Article 6 of the BIT.\n\nTR-E, 2016 August Hearing, Day 2, p. 459:10-18 (Kahale, King); 2017 March Hearing, Day 15, p. 4518:5-4522:19 (Partasides); 2017 September Hearing, Day 18, p. 5264:1-10 (Kahale).\n\nRespondent's 2017 Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 23, 48, noting the difficulty of applying these provisions \"when the contract is over\" (para. 23).\n\nThe Claimants' Counsel explained at the March 2017 Hearing that their expropriation claim was not governed by the Discriminatory Action mechanism, which defines the value that has been expropriated but does not define the right related to the expropriation, nor does it represent an exclusive remedy; cf. TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 15, p. 4513:18-4516:22, 4521:9-4522:19 (Partasides).\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with the Respondent when it argues that Mr. Griffith, in his 17 September 1992 letter (R-97), accepted that the compensation provisions specifically address how \"assets and interest of Conoco will be valued and reimbursed in the event of nationalization\"35. This is not what Mr. Griffith wrote. In fact, he wrote to Mr. Aliro Rojas, CEO of Maraven, that Conoco wanted to know how this matter would be addressed in their forthcoming negotiation, noting further that they would like full compensation and an economic stability clause. He also noted that the project required positive tax legislation. This is not what they obtained, but this is not the same as submitting that Mr. Griffith had accepted in 1992 that the only remedy available in case of nationalization would be what was provided in the clauses on discriminatory treatment (respectively in the Congressional Condition No. 16). The Law on the Effects of the Process of Migration into Mixed Companies of the Association Agreements of the Orinoco Oil Belt, approved by the National Assembly of 11 September 2007, declared that these Agreements \"shall be extinguished\" (C-35).\n\nRespondent's 2017 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 53; TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 18, p. 5264:12-21 (Kahale).\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the Respondent's reliance on the compensation provisions as the rules governing the expropriation effective on 26 June 2007 is inconsistent with the terms and effects of the taking that did take place on that date, when Venezuela assumed directly the activities performed by the Associations and extinguished ConocoPhillips' ownership interests36, thus necessarily including the rights held by ConocoPhillips through the Association Agreements including those contained in the compensation provisions. As mentioned earlier, Witness Mommer recalled that, at that date, the Association Agreements were terminated37.\n\nWitness Mommer, TR-E, 2016 August Hearing, Day 3, p. 993:8-994:17.\n\nThe Witness used the term \"disappear\" (TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 7, p. 1838:16-17), further explaining that the assets were taken over (TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 7, p. 1716:14-15, 1854:12-13).\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent has denied that the Venezuelan Law for the Promotion and Protection of Investments of 22 October 1999 (R-12, C-1) had any role to play in respect of the expropriation decreed on 26 June 2007. It appears correct that the Claimants in the present case were not subject to the Investment Law. However, the joint ventures conducting each of the three Projects were in the opposite position. It has been explained by the Respondent in the jurisdictional phase of this proceeding that pursuant to Article 5 of Decree No. 1,867 of 11 July 2002 on Investment Law Regulation38 the three joint ventures heading each of the three Projects were to be considered as entities receiving the investment *(empresa receptora de la inversion)*39. These entities were therefore holding investments \"owned by or actually controlled by a Venezuelan or foreign individual or legal entity\" and thus subject to the Investment Law (Art. 3, last and sole paragraph - R-12). The Investment Law must prevail over the Association Agreements in the hypothesis that one would consider that these Agreements would govern the effects of their own expropriation.\n\nRegulation of the Decree with Rank and Force of Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments (RL-2).\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, dated 1 December 2008, para. 132, note 186, enumerating Petrolera Zuata, Petrozuata C.A., the Corocoro Development Consortium, and the Hamaca Association. Cf. also Legal Expert Opinion of Enrique Urdaneta Fontiveros, dated 28 November 28, 2008, para. 31.\n\n177.\n\nIn any event the Tribunal notes that if the Claimants' claim for compensation was governed by the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements, it would be covered by the arbitration clauses contained therein (Sec. 9.07(f) and Sec. 13.16 for Petrozuata, and Sec. 14.4 for Hamaca). No claim based on these provisions is before this ICSID Tribunal. This, however, does not mean that these provisions are irrelevant for this Tribunal's ruling on the consequences of the expropriation that breached Article 6(c) of the BIT.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Respondent's statement that \"the issue before this Tribunal is not to determine whether the Association Agreements have been breached, but whether the compensation mechanisms established pursuant to the Congressional Authorizations as conditions to entering into the upgrading Projects are relevant in determining quantum\"40. The question is correctly framed and deserves further consideration. It implies necessarily that the expropriation enforced by the State on 26 June 2007 is not to be examined as part of a claim invoking a breach of the Association Agreements. The Respondent's statement, quoted above, is not different from the Claimants' opening submission at the 2016 August Hearing that the Association Agreements are the basis for determining quantum. It was pleaded that in asking the question \"what is it that was taken from ConocoPhillips?\" the Claimants recognized that you must look at the \"bundle of rights\" that were taken. The Claimants further stated that they also recognized that that \"bundle of rights\" centers on the Association Agreements and the value that they represented to ConocoPhillips41.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, 18 August 2014, para. 155.\n\nTR-E, 2016 August Hearing, Day 1, p. 78:2-9 (Partasides).\n\nc. The compensation provisions are part of the legal structure and the economic value of the Association Agreements\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nIrrespective of whether the standard of compensation is \"just compensation\" under Article 6(c) of the BIT or \"full\" reparation based on customary international law, both sources of law cannot govern exclusively the determination of the compensation and its amount. In one way or the other, compensation reflects a value corresponding to the loss suffered by those whose rights are affected by the expropriation. These rights are not determined and have not been acquired on the basis of either Article 6 of the BIT or general or customary international law. These are rights, mostly rights *in rem* or based on contractual undertakings that have been created and are held under national law. In this respect, the Respondent submits correctly that Article 9(5) of the BIT has to be given full effect when it refers to \"the law of the Contracting State concerned\" and to \"the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments\", thus relying upon the provisions of the Association Agreements and related provisions of the laws of Venezuela. None of the other sources of law enumerated in Article 9(5) are pertinent or applicable in this respect.\n\n180.\n\nIn other words, \"full compensation\", as the term is frequently used by the Claimants, cannot represent more than compensation of the rights and assets held by the Claimants at the relevant time and including revenues deriving therefrom in the future to an extent yet to be determined. Those rights were based on the Association Agreements, which are governed by Venezuelan law.\n\n181.\n\nTherefore, as the expropriation had the effect of depriving the Claimants from revenue they were entitled to receive under the Association Agreements, these Agreements apply fully, including their compensation provisions (as far as Petrozuata and Hamaca are concerned). To the extent that these provisions fixed a limitation on the Claimants' potential right to be paid the Project's dividends, such limitation has to be considered when determining the scope of the taking through the expropriation. Compensation represents a value corresponding to a loss. It cannot cover more than what the Claimants were entitled to if there had been no expropriation.\n\n182.\n\nFaced with a similar question, the Tribunal in *Burlington* noted that \"[it] must assume that Burlington holds the rights that made up the expropriated assets and that those rights are respected. This does not mean that the Tribunal is enforcing a contract claim. What the Tribunal does is to value an expropriated asset, which the Parties agree consists of a bundle of rights allowing Burlington to obtain future revenues\"42.\n\n*Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Award of 7 February 2017, para. 358, further noting that \"the expropriated contracts included a mandatory tax absorption clause which cannot be ignored for valuation purposes\" (para. 359).\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimants state correctly, as a principle, that they had not waived their rights under international law. However, while the protection of their rights as investors was governed by the BIT, the content of these rights was determined by the Association Agreements governed by the laws of Venezuela. This is what Article 2 of the BIT mentions as a Contracting Party's \"framework of its laws and regulations\" governing the investment. When accepting their investment in Venezuela through the Association Agreements and the Congressional Authorizations on which these Agreements were based, the Claimants acquired the rights contained in these instruments and covered by the available investment protection, which was, at the beginning, based on domestic law, and became the BIT at a later stage only. The investors' rights are those they acquired when making their investment in a Contracting State of the BIT. These rights were those contained in the Association Agreements; by definition, they cannot be subject to a waiver of international law rights. As well, the investors' participation in the Projects does not imply any waiver of rights contained in the BIT that governs the protection of the investment but not its substance.\n\nd. The operation of the compensation provisions in the present case\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe compensation provisions of the Association Agreements can be relevant in the present case to the extent only that a particular Government's measure meets all the requirements for their application.\n\n185.\n\nIn this respect, the raising of the income tax from 34% to 50% and the 33%% royalty/ex-traction tax that was in place at the time of the expropriation is no longer an issue. In its 2013 Decision, the Tribunal concluded that while the Claimants accepted to treat income tax and royalty rates as taxes, they constituted a fiscal regime that did not fall within the scope of Article 3 of the BIT, and that - as accepted by the Claimants - these measures (as they were at that time applicable) did not breach Article 4 of the BIT (para. 322). Moreover, these governmental measures are not invoked, in the present case, as discriminatory actions triggering the application of the compensation provisions. The Claimants rely on their experts' approach of including in their damages calculations all existing taxes at each valuation date, with the exception of the windfall profit tax43.\n\nClaimants' 2017 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 186; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 15, p. 4379:5-8 (Friedman); Abdala/Spiller, March 2016 Update, 18 March 2016, para. 28.\n\n186.\n\nThis has the effect that the windfall profit tax introduced in April 2008 and amended several times is the only measure which may need to be considered for the application of the compensation provisions.\n\n187.\n\nIt has been argued by the Respondent, relying mostly on Dr. Mommer's statement and the policy he tried to implement when he was a member of the Government, and still supported later on, that Venezuela would persist in exercising its sovereign power to capture excess profits resulting from oil prices above the agreed price caps. It is thus submitted that \"had the 2007 nationalization not taken place, the Government would have exercised its full taxing power to take such profit as it was entitled to do\"44. There is no legal basis for the Claimants' assumption to take full profit of post-nationalization price increases while ignoring all factors negatively affecting project economics, in particular those, such as taxes, that were virtually certain to materialize. The Tribunal notes, however, that leaving aside the windfall profit tax, including its amendments, no evidence has been submitted that would demonstrate that such a policy was seriously envisaged or on its way to be implemented. The highest level of exorbitant prices that this legislation was taking into account was US$ 110 per barrel45; since 2007, such level was never reached. It appears therefore as simple speculation when the Respondent argues that the Government was prepared to raise windfall profit taxes. Thus, the Tribunal must conclude that the evidence does not demonstrate any probability that any measure capturing profits in excess of the actual windfall profit tax would affect the Claimants' interest in the future and until the end of the life of the Projects.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, 18 August 2014, para. 138; Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 263.\n\nArticle 6 of Decree No. 40,114 of 20 February 2013 (R-502, C-600), amending Article 9(3) of Decree No. 8,807 of 15 April 2008 (R-500, C-252/582).\n\n188.\n\nTherefore, the actual windfall profit tax is the only hypothesis where the compensation provisions may have played a role or may need to be considered when determining the value of the Projects and the revenues of its participants. However, prior to arriving at this stage, the question will have to be examined whether such tax was capable of being applied to the Projects, in full or in part. All these issues being closely interrelated, they will have to be examined all together in their proper context, in Sections IX and X of this Award.\n\nC. The Standard of Compensation\n-------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe Parties' focus when addressing the structure of the claims for damages to be considered in the present case is closely related to the valuation date to be taken into account. The 2013 Decision determined that this date should be the date of the award (paras. 363, 404). Such date reflects the Claimants' position. The Respondent objects to this conclusion and strongly supports the date of the expropriation as the valuation date.\n\n190.\n\nThe debate about the relevant valuation date needs to be looked at from a larger perspective, which is the compensation the Claimants are entitled to claim as a consequence of the breach of Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondent's position is, as a matter of principle, that the compensation should represent the value of what has been taken away, which are the Association Agreements, including their compensation provisions (not applicable to Corocoro), and this at the time when such taking was enforced, on 26 June 2007. The hypothetical that has often been used is that of a reasonable buyer considering taking over the Association Agreements at that date. Simply put, such a buyer would evaluate the assets of the Projects and add his estimation of the net revenues reasonably to be projected in the future. As the participants in the Projects can be compared to such a reasonable buyer, their estimation of the assets and their projections of the future (generally called \"models\") may serve as a most useful working tool to reach a result coming close to what would become the conclusion of a hypothetical reasonable buyer.\n\n192.\n\nSuch position and method does not operate in actual terms. It does not include production, costs and taxes as they accrue since the taking up to the time when the award is made, nor does it determine the future economics of the Projects between the date of the award and the end of the Projects' lifetime.\n\n193.\n\nThe difference of approach is a matter of law. It is a matter of international law. As has been explained above, the expropriation enforced by Venezuela in breach of Article 6 of the BIT triggers effects under international law. The standard of compensation is not determined by the Association Agreements and their compensation provisions. Notwithstanding this, these provisions may have an impact on the value of the taking and thus on the amount of damages.\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal directed the Parties in Procedural Order No. 4 to determine their valuations for both situations, at the date of the expropriation, *i.e.* 26 June 2007, or on 31 December 2016, by taking into account, or not taking into account, the compensation formulas contained in the Association Agreements (para. 6). The Parties have basically complied with the Tribunal's direction. However, they only considered the hypothesis of the application of the compensation provisions, *i.e*. that the expropriation as such would have been governed by these provisions. Little consideration was thus left for the case where compensation for the expropriation is governed by international law, while including effects to be given to the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements in respect of those economic inputs that qualify as \"Discriminatory Actions\".\n\n195.\n\nThe matter of the standard of compensation applicable in the present case under international law needs to be clarified first, before the meaning of a specific valuation date can be determined.\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimants' approach in support of their claims is repeatedly based on \"full reparation\". This results from settled principles of international law. Because Venezuela's expropriation was unlawful, the Claimants must receive the substantial cash flows produced by the Projects since the expropriation. The host State cannot receive the full benefit of the Claimants' investment and thus draw from the expropriation revenue exponentially increasing through higher oil prices, in a total amount many times higher than the compensation it would have accepted to pay if it would have been calculated at the time of the taking.\n\n197.\n\nThe Claimants submit that had Venezuela expropriated lawfully the Claimants' investments, then the standard of compensation set out in Article 6(c) of the BIT would have applied. Because Venezuela acted unlawfully, that Article does not apply to quantification. Instead, the applicable standard of compensation is fixed by customary international law. An \"essential principle\" of customary international law is that a State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by its wrongful act.\n\n198.\n\nAn authoritative description of the applicable standard of compensation has been provided by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case46. \"Reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\" (p. 47) The ILC Articles reflect the same customary international law rule (CL-85). They require that a State provides \"full reparation for the injury caused by [its] internationally wrongful act\". Accordingly, where an asset has been expropriated unlawfully, a tribunal's task is to place the investor in the economic position that the investor would have enjoyed had the wrongful act never occurred. This is often referred to as the \"but-for\" position. The preferred remedy is restitution. Where restitution is impossible or impracticable, as is the case here, the rule of full reparation requires an award of damages that accomplishes the same result. Compensation for an unlawful expropriation must correspond to the value which restitution in kind would produce, in addition to payment for any additional losses.\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice, *The Factory At Chorz\u00f3w (Claim for Indemnity) (The Merits), Germany v. Poland*, Judgment No. 13, 13 September 1928, 1928 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 17 (CL-84).\n\n199.\n\nIf the Claimants' interests in the three Projects had not been unlawfully expropriated, the Claimants would have remained in possession of them and profited from their operations for their full term. In particular, the Claimants would have received, from June 2007 onwards, dividends representing their share of the profits in accordance with their ownership interest. The most common method for calculating such value is to determine the fair market value on the date of valuation, as this is stated in the Commentary to the ILC Articles (CL-86). Such value reflects the lost earnings that an investor would have received but-for the expropriation. In cases involving revenue-producing assets, an assessment of fair market value must compensate their future profitability in order to provide full reparation.\n\n200.\n\nBoth the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects were oil fields in full commercial production at the time of their confiscation, and they will continue to be producing oil through the date of the Award and for many years thereafter. The Corocoro Project became a producing oil field in January 2008 and will continue to be producing through at least 2021. The Projects' Reserves and production capacity are known, and their hydrocarbon products are commodities for which a broad market with international price benchmarks exists. The discount cash flow methodology used by the Claimants' experts properly calculates that substantial value.\n\n201.\n\nIn the present case, the standard of compensation requires that (a) the Claimants be awarded compensation equivalent to the cash flows that they would have received had the Projects not been expropriated; (b) favorable market changes since the taking accrue to the benefit of the Claimants; and (c) value depressing measures adopted or permitted by Venezuela after the taking must be excluded from the calculation.\n\n202.\n\nThe principle of full reparation requires an award to the Claimants of: (1) Historical losses up to the date of the Award, in the amount of at least US$ 16,010 billion; (2) Lost profits from the date of the Award through the expiration dates of the Association Agreements, in the amount of at least US$ 5,276 billion; (3) Post-award interest, calculated using the Projects' cost of equity; (4) A declaration that the amount awarded is net of taxes, and may not be taxed again by Venezuela; (5) All of the Claimants' costs of arbitration.\n\n*2. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that the expropriation was decreed under Venezuelan Law and that the Tribunal has concluded that the requirements set in Article 6(1) and (2) of the BIT have been fulfilled. Therefore, the expropriation was legal and fully effective. The Tribunal's conclusion that no compensation had been paid affects one of the modalities of the expropriation, but does not render this measure illegal. Therefore, the compensation the Claimants are entitled to is the compensation that they did not receive when they had been expropriated. Their compensation must thus be necessarily based on the value of the Projects at the time of their taking, including an amount representing the estimations of future profits and losses reasonably calculated at that same time.\n\n204.\n\nThe Respondent relies on Sir Ian Brownlie who defined the distinction between an expropriation unlawful only *sub modo* and one unlawful *per se* as follows:\n\nThe practical distinctions between expropriation unlawful *sub modo*, i.e. only if no provision is made for compensation, and expropriation unlawful *per se* would seem to be these: the former involves a duty to pay compensation only for direct losses, i.e. the value of the property, the latter involves liability for consequential loss (*lucrum cessans*); the former confers a title which is recognized in foreign courts (and international tribunals), the latter produces no valid title47.\n\nIan Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, 7th ed. Oxford 2008, p. 539 (R-124). The Respondent also refers to James Crawford, Brownlie's Principles of Public International Law, p. 625 (R-631).\n\n205.\n\nThe Respondent submits that under Article 9(3) of the BIT, this Tribunal in any event would have no authority to award damages beyond those \"caused\" by a breach of a Treaty provision. Even assuming that there is a breach due to a failure to pay or make a concrete offer of compensation, there are no damages resulting from a breach other than the compensation that should have been paid in 2007 plus interest.\n\n206.\n\nUsing the valuation date of 26 June 2007 and applying the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects, the Respondent calculates a compensation in the total amount of 471 US$ million, which may, if the Tribunal so decides, be increased by the end of 2016 by simple interest to 515 US$ million, any such amount being reduced by the Respondent's costs.\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it unnecessary to provide lengthy quotations from the *Chorz\u00f3w* Judgment. Nevertheless, the main *ratio decidendi* must be recalled, albeit as concisely as possible.\n\n208.\n\nThe Court's Judgment was based on \"the rules of international law in force between the two States concerned\". Rights or interests of an individual are \"on a different plane\". The damage suffered by an individual is \"never therefore identical in kind with that which will be suffered by a State\" (p. 28). It needs also to be added that when one refers to Article 31 of the ILC Articles (CL-85), the provisions on State responsibility are \"without prejudice to any right, arising from the international responsibility of a State, which may accrue directly to any person or entity other than a State\" (Art. 33(2)).\n\n209.\n\nAs to the applicable principle on damages, the Court stated that the damage suffered by one of the two companies involved (named \"the Oberschlesische\") is \"equivalent to the total value -but to that total value only - of the property, rights and interests of this Company\" (p. 31). The principle establishing the obligation to make reparation is the indispensable complement of a failure to apply a convention. It is \"an element of positive international law\" (p. 29)48.\n\nThe *Teinver* Tribunal sought to make it more precise: \"The *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case is not the source of the customary international law principle of full reparation, but the tribunal in that case determined that that principle was one that had been established by international practice.\" *Teinver S.A.,* et al. *v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Award dated 21 July 2017, para. 1089.\n\n210.\n\nIn the *Chorz\u00f3w* case, the Court was not seized with a claim for compensation in relation to an expropriation, because under the applicable provisions of the Geneva Convention concerning Upper Silesia concluded on 13 May 1922 between Germany and Poland, an expropriation was not permitted even against compensation. Therefore, reparation was the consequence not of the application of Articles 6 to 22 of the Geneva Convention, \"but of acts contrary to those articles\", *i.e.* dispossession (p. 46).\n\n211.\n\nThe Court noted that the compensation due to the German Government is not necessarily limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus interest to the day of payment. If the Polish Government had the right to expropriate and its wrongful act therefore consisted merely in not having paid the just price for what was expropriated, compensation would be limited to such value. This would put Germany in a situation \"more unfavourable\" than that in which Germany would be placed if Poland had respected the Convention, *i.e.* if it had not acted as it did. This would be \"unjust\". Moreover, \"it would be tantamount to rendering lawful liquidation and unlawful dispossession indistinguishable in so far as their financial results are concerned\" (p. 47).\n\n212.\n\nThe distinction made by the Court applies in other situations as well. An expropriation enforced legally except for not being compensated puts the aggrieved party in a situation more unfavourable than that in which it would be placed if such expropriation had not been made. In the latter case, that party would enjoy the full benefit of the property, rights and interests that have been taken away. In the former situation, it would have received a \"just compensation\" in an amount that is different and generally lower than the benefit of the on-going enjoyment of all that has been taken away.\n\n213.\n\nHowever, the present case is different. While still following the Court's reasoning, an expropriation enforced legally except for not being compensated puts the aggrieved party in a situation more unfavourable than that in which it would be placed if such expropriation had been made in compliance with all legal requirements. Indeed, the difference between these two situations, which puts that party in a more unfavourable position, consists in the lack of payment of the compensation that the expropriating party was required to pay.\n\n214.\n\nSuch a difference cannot be reduced to a simple matter of interest to be paid. If the expropriation had to be compensated by reference to the market price at the date when it was enforced, the value of this compensation - if it has not been paid - does not increase merely by a factor based on a rate of interest. At a later date, the value of the expropriated property, rights and interests is different, usually by reference to a higher market price. Such difference has nothing to do with interest. The value of an investment in a business (not consisting merely of placing money in a bank account) is progressing on a line which cannot be compared to the rate of interest.\n\n215.\n\nThe *Chorz\u00f3w* Court did not elaborate on such a hypothesis. It simply compared the actual case to the financial situation of Germany in a case where Poland would have been entitled to expropriate but merely omitted to pay a just price. The main point still stands: The investor or the otherwise aggrieved party should not be dealt with more unfavourably by the adjudicating tribunal through \"just compensation\", including interest, while it was entitled not to be expropriated without just compensation determined by reference to market value at the time of the taking. When such compensation was one of the legal requirements to operate an expropriation, the fact of not proceeding with such payment renders the expropriation unlawful and triggers the financial consequences of the loss of the property, rights and interests that have been taken.\n\n216.\n\nThe same line of arguments applies to the expropriating host State. If compensation was awarded a certain time after the taking as the \"just price\" for what was expropriated, together with interest, the host State would be treated more favourably than the situation it would face with an expropriation that should not have taken place without compensation. If there had been no expropriation, the investor would have enjoyed the revenues and the increase in the market value of the property, rights and interests. If no account was made of such increase in value, the financial result would be indistinguishable from the situation where compensation had been paid on time in compliance with the legal requirements. The host State would thus take advantage of all financial accruals, to the extent they are higher than the interest rate it would have to pay on the \"just price\" settled at the time of the taking. In the words of the Court, such result would be \"unjust\".\n\n217.\n\nIn a number of awards and various writings, a distinction is made between unlawful and lawful expropriations. The latter expression is reserved for a case where the expropriation complies with the legal requirements except that no or insufficient compensation has been provided. The *Chorz\u00f3w* Judgment is sometimes used to support such terminology. Such interpretation of the *Chorz\u00f3w* Judgment goes too far. The Court did not use the term \"legal\" or \"lawful\" expropriation for a situation where the expropriator's \"wrongful act\" (\"son tort\") consisted merely in having not paid the just price of what was expropriated (p. 47)49. On another occurrence, the Court notes that if an expropriation were to be envisaged, the payment of fair compensation would have rendered it lawful50 - thus including the requirement for compensation in the notion of lawful expropriation, and its omission as keeping the expropriation unlawful.\n\nIn this connection, the Court uses the expression \"lawful liquidation\", \u00ab liquidation licite \u00bb.\n\n\"to render which lawful only the payment of fair compensation would have been wanting\" - \u00ab a laquelle n'aurait manqu\u00e9, pour etre l\u00e9gitime, que le paiement d'une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e9quitable \u00bb (p. 46, No. 123).\n\n218.\n\nSir Ian Brownlie's *dictum* relied upon by the Respondent, is not pertinent. The Respondent's own submission is not as severe as Sir Ian appears to be, because the Respondent accepts to take into account the projections of future profits *(lucrum cessans)* which are not included in Sir Ian's notion of an expropriation unlawful *sub modo*. The Respondent adds its own interpretation of Sir Ian's statement that it omits to quote fully and in context51. When reading the parts preceding the sentence quoted by the Respondent, it is easy to understand that Sir Ian did not address the factor of time. He did not say that an expropriation is lawful if only payment of effective compensation is missing, and that it remains so for the future. The learned author only addressed the situation at the time of the taking. Further, when referring to an expropriation not accompanied by compensation, he uses, indeed, the expression of \"unlawful *sub modo*\" (by contrast to an expropriation unlawful *per se*). Thus, even when considered *sub modo*, such expropriation is nevertheless, in Sir Ian's view, \"unlawful\". Sir Ian's \"Compensation Rule\" confirms the distinction:\n\nThe expropriation of alien property is lawful if prompt, adequate, and effective compensation is provided for. In principle, therefore, expropriation, as an exercise of territorial competence, is lawful, but the compensation rule (in this version) makes the legality condi-tional52.\n\nIan Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, p. 538/539 (R-124). The Respondent also refers to James Crawford, Brownlie's Principles of Public International Law, p. 625 (R-631), where no delayed payment of compensation is mentioned.\n\nBrownlie, *ibidem*, p. 533/4.\n\n219.\n\nThe correct terminology does not really matter, although it may be noted that the use of the expression \"lawful expropriation\" seems not to be the most appropriate when it implies that one of the key elements of an expropriation - compensation - is missing. In any event, the focus must be on the significance of such term as it is used in a number of awards. It should mean, indeed, that the investor that suffered an expropriation that was otherwise \"lawful\" (except for the non-payment of compensation), is not entitled to claim for more than the payment by the host State of such compensation reflecting the market value of the investment at the moment of the expropriation, plus interest to the day of payment.\n\n220.\n\nThus, the *Tidewater* Tribunal concluded \"that compensation for a lawful expropriation is fair compensation represented by the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession and reparation in case of unlawful expropriation is restitution in kind or its monetary equivalent\"53. The *Mobil* Tribunal stated that \"the mere fact that an investor has not received compensation does not in itself render an expropriation unlawful\"54.\n\n*Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewaterr Caribe, C.A. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, Award of 13 March 2015, para. 142, and further paras. 130-146, 159-163 (R-642). The Tribunal observes at one point that an expropriation only wanting fair compensation has to be considered as a \"provisionally lawful expropriation\" (para. 141). However, to take the quality as \"provisional\" away, the simple award of compensation is not sufficient. And the Tribunal has no power to state such a declaration that it was not requested to make by the claimants.\n\n*Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holding, B.V. et al. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award of 9 October 2014, para. 301 (CL-348).\n\n221.\n\nIn a number of cases, the difference between the compensation as determined at the moment of the expropriation and the assessment of damages resulting from the omission to provide for such payment at that time is of limited or no impact. Indeed, the assessment of the just compensation to be paid by the host State is usually based on market value or similar concepts that include consideration of prospective revenues and costs. The result may thus often come close to an assessment of actual revenues and expenses accumulated at the time of the award. This explains why many awards do not entertain any debate about the proper time for assessing damages, simply stating that the investor is entitled to be paid the compensation it did not receive when the expropriation took place, plus interest. The proper distinctions to be made are sometimes further diluted when it is stated that the investor shall receive compensation as it should have been paid at the time of the expropriation, while a number of particular items of revenue and costs are then quantified by reference to more recent or actual values.\n\n222.\n\nOther cases are different and so is the situation in the present case.\n\n223.\n\nArticle 6 of the BIT is structured in three parts, each part representing one of the three conditions to be fulfilled to render an expropriation admissible under the BIT. The allocation of a \"just compensation\" is one of those requirements. As the Tribunal has concluded and explained in its 2017 Interim Decision, this requirement has not been fulfilled by the Respondent. Therefore, one of the three cumulatively applicable requirements has not been met, and Article 6 of the BIT has been breached. Such unlawful act calls for reparation of the Claimants' losses.\n\n224.\n\nAccording to the well-known principle settled in the *Chorz\u00f3w* Judgment, \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\" (p. 47). Assuming that restitution in kind is not possible, the amount of compensation should correspond to a sum reflecting the value which a restitution in kind would bear, and damages for loss sustained which would not otherwise be covered. The dispossession involves the obligation to restore the undertaking and, if this is not possible, to pay its value at the time of the indemnification. To this obligation must be added that of compensating loss sustained as the result of the seizure. Thus, the reparation is about substituting payment of the value of the undertaking for restitution (p. 48). The Court added that these principles do not apply as if \"an expropriation properly so called was involved.\" (p. 48).\n\n225.\n\nWhen instructing the experts on their enquiry on the valuation to be retained, the *Chorz\u00f3w* Court asked for the value of the undertaking for the manufacture of nitrate products at the date of dispossession, and the financial results current at the present time (profits or losses). This question had to cover the monetary value, both of the object of the undertaking, together with any probable profit (\"*lucrum cessans*\") that would have accrued to it between the taking of possession and that of the expert opinion55. While the note of the Court that these principles are different from those applicable in the case of an expropriation must be kept in mind, it can be concluded that when considering \"wiping-out\" all the consequences of an unlawful expropriation, the situation of the investor has to be addressed as it would, in all probability, have existed if that unlawful taking had not taken place.\n\np. 51-53, No. 136, 141.\n\n226.\n\nIf this was not accepted and the right to compensation was limited to the amount of \"just compensation\" referred to in Article 6(c) of the BIT, there would be no reparation of the wrong committed by the Respondent. The resulting compensation would simply be deferred from July 2007 to the date of this Award, together with interest. There would be no sanction of a manifest breach of the provision of Article 6(c) of the BIT, which implies a breach of Article 6 as a whole when prohibiting expropriation as long as one of the three pertinent conditions is not fulfilled. In the meantime, in the period between the taking and the rendering of this Award, the Projects would operate as decided by the Venezuelan Government and with all the benefits accruing to them, in particular when taking into account the increase in oil prices. This is not what the BIT provides and international law allows.\n\n227.\n\nThe consequence of the unlawful expropriation and the purpose of reparation are to make the Claimants whole. If reparation consisted only in providing compensation as it had to be paid at the time of taking, plus interest, the Claimants would be deprived of the difference between the market value estimated at that time and the benefit of the Projects actually accruing since the expropriation and the date of this Award and in the future until the end of the Projects' lifetime. The Respondent would thus acquire, through the expropriation, profits available to the Claimants through the Projects above the range of the market value that would serve as reference to the determination of the \"just compensation\" at the time of the taking. For this part of the expropriation, no compensation would ever be paid. Such a result is implied in a compensation scheme as provided by Article 6(c) of the BIT, provided payment occurs at the same time. If such compensation is not effectively made or differed, the expropriating State would take on both levels: no account is provided for the market value at the date of the taking, and the full actual and future value of the Projects as from that date accrues to the State. Making, under such circumstances, the Claimants' whole means that \"just compensation\" as valued at the time of the expropriation cannot be achieved.\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal adds that the proper identification of the remedy for a violation of the BIT should respect the object and purpose of the BIT as this must apply to the BIT's provisions on investment protection in general. If \"just compensation\" is determined as per the date of the expropriation, and taken forward through a simple rate of interest, the host State would draw a clear advantage from its taking, as it did in the present case. Thus, such interpretation would result in an incentive for host States to expropriate investments and to defer payment of compensation until an undetermined future date. Such an approach would defeat the purpose of \"protection of investment\" that is the object of the BIT as stated in its Preamble.\n\n229.\n\nAn approach taking account of the future economics of the Projects requires a further clarification in respect of the date when the pertinent values in relation to the Projects have to be determined. An expropriation consisting of a single taking is valued as of the date of such taking. This is true, however, only by reference to that particular date. When time goes on, values change. Revenues may go up, costs are developing differently, and taxes may increase. In the present case, the rising oil prices are the main factor which informs the debate on the fixing of the appropriate valuation date. It led this Tribunal to determine in its 2013 Decision that this date shall be the date of this Award.\n\nD. Valuation Date and Method\n----------------------------\n\n230.\n\nIn the context of the debate between the Parties, the question is whether the relevant elements for the assessment of damages (including revenues, costs, taxes and others) are those applied or known at the time of the expropriation, or those at the time when the judgment has to be made about the damages accrued until that day and those arising as of that day. This is why, the Parties are at odds between an *ex ante* valuation and an *ex post* valuation. The matter is closely linked to the applicable standard of compensation. If the Claimants' compensation is what they did not receive when they had been expropriated, the value of their loss must be assessed *ex ante*, as of the day of the taking, including an estimation prevailing at that time in respect of profits, losses and costs and other relevant items, occurring in the future. If, on the other hand, the Claimants are entitled to receive compensation for all revenues and net profits they would have earned had the Projects not been expropriated, the valuation has to be made by including all available actual (historical) and future data, which results in a valuation focusing on the matter from an *ex post* viewpoint.\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n231.\n\nConsistent with settled law, it follows for the Claimants that their right to full reparation has as its necessary consequence that the date of valuation must be the date of the Award.\n\n232.\n\nAs a result of the improving market conditions all three Projects have increased in value following their confiscation. The Claimants are entitled to the benefit of those market improvements; they would have benefited from them had the Projects not been illegally taken. The consequences of any mismanagement of the Projects by PDVSA cannot be considered in the valuation, since this would not have occurred in the \"but-for\" world.\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined that the valuation date is the date of the Award. Accordingly, the Tribunal's valuation should take account of market developments subsequent to the taking that have increased the value of the Projects. Therefore, what remains to be calculated in the Claimants view is (a) lost historical cash flows: Forgone cash flows from the Projects between the date of the taking (26 June 2007) and the date of the Tribunal's Award, with a capitalization factor applied to actualize the lost historical cash flows to present value. (b) The equity value of the investments at the valuation date: Lost cash flows from the date of the Award through the end date of the Agreements, calculated using a DCF method to reduce those future cash flows to present value. (c) Post-award interest on all sums awarded from the date of Award to the date of payment. (d) Arbitration costs.\n\n*2. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nFor the Respondent, there is no basis for departing from the Treaty valuation date. This date is defined by Article 6(c) which states that the market value to be referred to is either the date \"immediately before the measures were taken or the impending measures became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier\". But even if the Tribunal could depart from the Treaty standard and look to customary international law, the result would be exactly the same.\n\n235.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondent submits that the normal valuation date in expropriation cases is the date of dispossession and that the valuation date does not change if the expropriation is one \"to render which lawful only the payment of fair compensation would have been wanting\", as stated in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory*56. The authorities, including this decision, are crystal clear that where the only basis for unlawfulness is failure to pay compensation, the valuation date remains the date of dispossession because the damages are calculated based on the amount of compensation that should have been paid at that date, plus interest until the date of payment.\n\nQuoting the *Chorz\u00f3w* Judgment, p. 46.\n\n236.\n\nRelying on Sir Ian Brownlie's statement, quoted above, the Respondent contends that the valuation date in the case of an expropriation that at worst is only unlawful *sub modo*, rather than *per se*, is the date of dispossession because damages for such an expropriation consist of the value of the property expropriated as of that date, plus interest to the date of payment.\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the *ex ante* valuations takes into account production, cost and price information that are considered relevant as of the 2007 valuation date. The Claimants' approach to such a valuation is not different. The difference between the Parties' valuations results from their difference in the *ex ante* production projections, because the Claimants take a much more optimistic view of the condition of the Petrozuata field and the Hamaca upgrader than the Respondent does as of the 2007 valuation date. Although an *ex post* valuation is supposed to be based on what actually happened in the Projects after the 2007 nationalization, the Claimants avoid considering *ex post* data that negatively affects value, thus submitting a hybrid valuation that bears no relationship with actual facts. The Respondent notes than when this Tribunal examines what actually happened, it cannot ignore the negative developments in the Projects in terms of both production and costs.\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\na. The Parties' positions\n-------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that while the Parties present their respective positions with strong arguments, they are not always consistent.\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimants' *ex post* valuation approach would require, in theory, taking into account all available data on production, costs and other relevant factors of economics at the actual date and in moving data forward up to the date of judgment. This is not what they have always done, and it is not what their experts have done. Thus, they have taken the pre-expropriation production forecasts as the appropriate source for determining oil production in the but-for world. The Respondent pointed to the Claimants' preference to identify costs on the basis of costs accrued and projected costs before the date of expropriation, arguing that the costs listed by the Respondent were *in toto* not reliable and unpersuasive; here again, such approach is like turning suddenly to an *ex ante* valuation, while an *ex post* approach would have required a closer examination of the evidence presented by the Respondent in respect of costs incurred since June 2007.\n\n240.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand does not conduct consistently an *ex ante* valuation that it claims should be the only relevant for this Tribunal. Such valuation would require taking all facts as they existed at the date of the expropriation, including the projections of the future on the basis of the best knowledge then available. In other words, the approach would have to be the one adopted by a reasonable buyer at that very moment, and nothing else. A correct date-of-expropriation valuation would not use the figures for production in year 2008, nor the forecasts prepared by Mr. Figuera in 2009, which projects the recovery of 653 million barrels of EHCO - substantially less than expected by all Parties prior to the expropriation57. An *ex ante* valuation would require that costs and taxes that could not have been reasonably envisaged at the time of the taking are not taken into account. This was not always done, for reasons that one can understand quite easily, but this approach is nevertheless not consistent with an *ex ante* calculation. The same is true in respect of additional expenses for the lease of the Interim Processing Facility (IPF) in the period between 2007-2012 at Corocoro58. Finally, a factual event that occurred before the date pertinent for the *ex ante* observation (*i.e.* 26 June 2007) must be identical to the same fact evaluated from an *ex post* perspective. For instance, when an upgrader's capacity is estimated as above 90% OSF in the year 2006, as observed at the date of the expropriation, this figure cannot become 75% simply because different information was provided in later years and integrated in the *ex post* valuation59. The best evidence must be the same from both perspectives when relating to a fact prior to the *ex ante* point of time.\n\nCf. Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, paras. 113, using figures provided by Figuera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, paras. 26-30, which were in part based on actual information for the years 2008 and 2009. The same approach was followed for Hamaca. At the 2017 September Hearing, Counsel of the Respondent admitted that with the actual figures presented for the second part of 2007 and for year 2008, they were not presenting *ex ante* projections; TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 4891:3-14 (Preziosi).\n\nCf. Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, paras. 174, 182-188.\n\nCf., *ibidem*, paras. 139, 345.\n\n241.\n\nIn fact, whether one takes a principled position of an *ex ante* or an *ex post* valuation, none of these approaches can be conducted according to its own logic. Two main factors explain this. (1) The pressure of actual data often prevails. There is often no point in relying on hypothetical facts that have proven to be wrong. (2) On the other hand, there are occurrences where actual data are either not available or not reliable, leaving no other choice but to turn to projections that have been prepared carefully and agreed upon by those involved at the relevant time before the expropriation became effective.\n\n242.\n\nThe Respondent's experts have presented an article that explains the operation of the two valuation methods and the bargain that divides them60. For the author, in an *ex ante* analysis, all damages projected after the date of the breach are present-value discounted back to the breach date to arrive at a damages amount as of that date; interest is then applied. In an *ex post* analysis, projected damages are present-valued to the date of trial. For the portion of damages between the breach date and the trial date (the interim period damages), a time-value of money factor is applied forward to the trial date; and the projected damages after the trial date (the post-interim period damages) are present-value discounted back to the date of trial. The challenge for an *ex ante* analysis is that ignoring subsequent information may artificially ignore actual impacts to the plaintiff that, if considered, would result in a more precise estimate of the plaintiff's loss. In contrast, an *ex post* approach effectively attempts to put the plaintiff in the position he or she would have been in on the date of trial but-for the actions of the defendant. In evaluating both approaches, the effect of the interim period events on the plaintiff should be considered. Depending on whether the predominant economic factors affected positively or negatively the performance of the plaintiff, the plaintiff would be in a better or a worse position based on an *ex post* option, and the reverse would be the case when considering facts *ex ante* only. The question is then whether the defendant should not bear the risk of uncertainty produced by the act. If the defendant has not gained as a result of the act, an argument that plaintiff may be overcompensated via an *ex post* analysis may not carry much weight61. However, a damages award that returns the plaintiff to its economic position at the date of the injury, but leaves the defendant with a gain as a result of his action may not be appropriate and not deter future unlawful acts.\n\nStephen L. Buffo, Readings from the Book of Wisdom: Ex Post versus Ex Ante Damages, Stout, Risius Ross 2014, Brailovsky/Flores, Appendix 392. The experts refer to this article for the purpose of explaining what an *ex post* valuation should be, but they do not elaborate on the definition of an *ex ante* valuation, nor on the author's comparison of the two methods. Cf. Valuation Update, 18 March 2016, para. 41; Valuation Update Reply, 21 April 2016, para. 19.\n\nIn any event, in such a case, the loss must stay with the expropriating host State. The investor should not receive less than an investor who was hit by an expropriation fully complying with the BIT. Cf., for instance, in *Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, the Award of 6 February 2007 (CL-43), concluding that the claimant was entitled not just to the value of its enterprise as of the date of the expropriation, but also to any greater value that enterprise has gained up to the date of the award, plus any consequential damages (para. 352).\n\n243.\n\nThe comparison between the two valuation methods that are at the centre of the Parties' debate shows that one or the other cannot be adopted without a number of adjustments. The legal components should be looked at more in depth.\n\nb. The appropriate time factors\n-------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nIn its 2013 Decision, the Tribunal stated that it did not consider that the amount of the compensation payable in respect of an unlawful taking of an investment is to be determined under Article 6(c) of the BIT. This provision establishes a condition to be met if the expropriation is in all other respects in accordance with Article 6. The Tribunal concluded on the basis of principle and the authorities it had reviewed, that if the taking was unlawful, the date of valuation is the date of the award.\n\n245.\n\nArticle 6(c) of the BIT governs the compensation to be paid by the expropriating State at the time of the taking. It does not deal with the consequences of its breach. If one would submit that Article 6(c) continues to be applicable and governs the Claimants' claim for reparation, this would mean that this provision continues to govern compensation, with the simple addition of interest. This is not what the provision says. It refers exclusively to the market value at the time of the taking. No reference can be found in the text that Article 6(c) would remain applicable in the future and for years to come for the purpose of calculating the investor's compensation, to which only interest is added.\n\n246.\n\nThe expropriation has the effect of transferring the market value of the Projects to the host State. At the same time, pursuant to Article 6(c), just compensation is to be paid to the investors by reference to the same market value. Both sides are thus basically placed on equal terms. If no compensation is paid, the host State acquires the Projects at their market value, plus the forthcoming profit, while the investors are left with the market value the Projects had in the past.\n\n247.\n\nIf no payment was made, an *ex ante* valuation that assumes that payment was made on the date of expropriation and calculates interest thereafter would result in the State taking advantage of whatever difference between the real profit of the business and the interest. Indeed, Article 6(c) provides for payment to be made at the date of expropriation, without any further alternative or escape clause. If no compensation has been made at the required time, the loss must be determined independently from this provision and it is to be compensated by the host State. Nowhere is it provided that such loss consists simply of interest.\n\n248.\n\nAn *ex ante* valuation makes sense only if it results in an *ex ante* payment. The hypothetical of a reasonable buyer considering the acquisition of the Projects, as presented by the Respondent, is a buyer who acquires the Project the very day when it has been taken away from the Claimants, and who pays the relevant amount at that date. A reasonable buyer who defers its acquisition to a later point in time will reconsider the market value of the Projects at that moment and pay the amount then corresponding to the actual market value. As prices move, up and down, the buyer will not suggest fixing price on the basis of an *ex ante* analysis (plus interest), and no seller would accept to make a deal on such basis.\n\n249.\n\nThe World Bank's Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment cannot be understood otherwise. In its Chapter IV, payment of appropriate compensation is mentioned as one of the factors which allows a State to expropriate a foreign private investment. When declaring that such compensation must be adequate, effective and prompt, the implication is always that such payment takes place at the same time as the taking. In case a \"going concern\" is involved, future income that could be expected with reasonable certainty over the course of its economic life is to be included in the calculation; this must imply an assessment at the time of the expropriation. If compensation had to be evaluated at a later stage, actual or historical facts would certainly prevail over any earlier projection on the enterprise's economic life in the future. Similarly, when a willing buyer is supposed to consider specific characteristics of the investment, \"including the period in which it has been in existence\", this specific element will certainly have to be updated to present value if the purchase has not taken place when it was supposed to take place, *i.e.* at the date of the expropriation. There is no point in trying to read the Guidelines to assert that the valuation of the expropriated investment shall in all cases be settled at the date of expropriation.\n\n250.\n\nIf payment is not made on the day of the expropriation, and is differed to later, plus interest, the expropriator takes advantage on a day-to-day basis of the difference between the profit resulting from the operation of the Projects (representing the investment that had been taken) and the applicable interest. An *ex post* valuation corrects the unequal treatment resulting from such a calculation, because it supports payment including the profit resulting from an investment that the host State had taken without the burden of financing its value.\n\n251.\n\nIn so doing, the host State takes the benefit of the value of the investment above the legal terms when it should have paid the compensation. The purpose of the compensation provision is to make whole the investor, in terms of equitable market values, at the time of payment. If such payment is not done and deferred for later, it must necessarily be determined again by reference to the market value prevailing at that time. This is then equivalent to an *ex post* valuation.\n\n252.\n\nTaking an example for the purpose of illustration, when an oil production industry has a market value of 10 US$ billion at the time of expropriation and yields 10% of net profit, the host State, when not paying compensation and waiting for a judgment to be awarded some years later on the basis of an *ex ante* valuation (*i.e.* 10 billion), would earn 1 US$ billion per year as a result of an investment it did not provide itself, leaving the investors with interest at 300 million (3%), and the State with a net profit of 700 million. In fact, the investors will make a loss, because their costs for financing an investment of 10 US$ billion (still in the hands of the host State) are markedly higher than the interest rate of 3%. Thus, the host State receives more than the market value the investment had when it was expropriated. Such an extended taking has no basis in the provisions of Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n253.\n\nWhen taking account of facts that occurred after the expropriation, and before or after the Award, the pertinence of the available information may be questioned in its causal relation to the situation of the Projects as they existed at the time of the expropriation. The reparation must reestablish the Claimants in the situation which would, \"in all probability\"62, have existed if the expropriation had not taken place. In this respect, an *ex post* valuation is linked to the *ex ante* situation under which the Projects were conducted when they were expropriated. Such a link cannot be reduced to a simple condition of foreseeability. Facts may be relevant for the assessment of the but-for world even if not foreseeable at the time of the taking, as long as they can be assessed with reasonable certainty as the consequences of the initial situation at the time of the taking. Such facts must be capable of being placed in a chain of events that, albeit not foreseeable at an earlier point in time, nevertheless appear as an occurrence that under a reasonable perspective appears as potential consequence of the expropriation and the loss represented by the taking away of the Projects from the Claimants63.\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w* Judgment, p. 47, 53.\n\nCf. also the Award of 7 February 2017 *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, para. 333, using however the foreseeability as the prevailing factor, while correctly stating that the injury suffered must have been caused by the wrongful act. The same reasoning can be found in *Quiborax S.A. & Non Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Award of 16 September 2015 (R-577), paras. 382/383.\n\n254.\n\nAn *ex ante* approach calculates revenues accruing as from the date of the breach on the basis of projections. Such revenues are then discounted back to the date of the breach. This is Respondent's position, using a rate of 19.8%. Compared to actual facts, this has the effect of reducing compensation in two ways: (1) Revenues accruing in the future above the projected figures profit to the State, and (2) to the extent that the discount rate is higher than the interest rate, the positive difference accrues to the host State as well. Such approach ignores artificially any impact on the Claimants in the future, which, if considered, would result in a more precise estimate of the Claimants' losses. That is precisely what an *ex post* valuation does.\n\n255.\n\nContrary to what has been suggested, the view that an expropriation incompatible with the BIT for the only reason that no compensation has been paid calls for a valuation at the date of the expropriation is not as broadly shared as this is sometimes argued64.\n\nFor an overview of the case law, *see* Steven R. Ratner, Compensation for Expropriations in a World of Investment Treaties: Beyond the Lawful/Unlawful Distinction, American Journal of International Law 2017 p. 7 ff., 15-18.\n\n256.\n\nIn some cases, this solution was retained but for reasons different from the so-called \"legal\" nature of an expropriation which only lacks compensation. In the case of the *Crystallex* Award65, the parties agreed that the proper date of valuation should be the date of expropriation. This was also the basis for the same solution for the *Saint-Gobain* Tribunal66, with the additional element that in the particular case such valuation date yielded a higher value than the date-of-the-award valuation.\n\n*Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016, para. 854.\n\n*Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Europe v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/13, Decision on Liability and the Principles of Quantum of 30 December 2016, paras. 611-614 (R-655).\n\n257.\n\nIn other awards, compensation was simply treated as one of the conditions for an expropriation not prohibited under the BIT, with the effect that if no compensation has been paid, one of the Treaty requirements has not been complied with, resulting in an unlawful expropriation as if any of the other requirements had not been met. Accordingly, the *Crystallex* Award states as follows\n\nWhen a treaty cumulatively requires several conditions for a lawful expropriation, arbitral tribunals seem uniformly to hold that failure of any one of those conditions entails a breach of the expropriation provision67.\n\nThe Tribunal then concluded\n\nUnder the circumstances, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that Venezuela breached Article VII(1) of the Treaty, as no \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation\" was either offered or provided to Crystallex68.\n\nThe *Crystallex* Tribunal referred to seven other awards considering the lack of payment of just compensation as a breach of the pertinent provision of the applicable BIT on expropriation69. The *Quiborax*70, *Tenaris*71 and *Burlington*72 Awards can be added to the list. This Tribunal has decided accordingly in its Interim Decision.\n\n*Cristallex International Corporation v.

In other terms, if any of those conditions is violated, there is a breach of Article 6.\"); *Saluka Investments BV v.

In such a case valuation and compensation should assess damages as identified at the time of the expropriation, including what the investor expected at that time in terms of future profits and expansion. The facts known at the date of the expropriation are taken as the reference, as they are the only ones objectively related to the dispute74.\n\n*Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID ARB/10/5, Award of 13 March 2015 (R-642), paras. 130-146, 159-163.\n\nThe same position is shared by Arbitrator Brigitte Stern, who was a member of the *Tidewater* Tribunal, in her partially dissenting opinion to *Quiborax S.A. and Non Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Award dated 16 September 2015 (R-577). The dissenting arbitrator notes that an expropriation \"which only lacks fair compensation to be lawful has to be treated as a potentially lawful expropriation (or a provisionally unlawful expropriation until the tribunal has awarded the compensation due for the expropriation to be legal)\" (para. 17, emphasis omitted). However, the Tribunal's task in such a case is not to render an expropriation lawful that has not been lawful before, but to draw the legal consequences of an expropriation not complying with the law because not accompanied by the required compensation.\n\n259.\n\nThe reasons underlying such position are based on the concern that an arbitral tribunal should avoid considering events occurring after the expropriation, such as the evolution of prices, potential expansion of the business or other circumstances that may appear as hypothetical or even speculative. Such a concern must certainly be taken seriously. However, it does not allow a broad conclusion that events occurring after the expropriation shall have no bearing on the tribunal's assessment of the loss suffered by the expropriated party and of the damages to be awarded. The *Chorz\u00f3w* Judgment does not support such an understanding. In this case, the plaintiff was Germany that had no claim to raise in respect of future revenues of the manufacture in which it had no operational impact.\n\n260.\n\nThe *Tidewater* Tribunal's approach appears correct when reference is made to the date of the expropriation in all respects including the determination and payment of the just compensation due to the investor. If no compensation has been paid, however, valuation moves forward, and so does the profit accruing to the host State as from the date of the taking, and the loss suffered by the investor who did not receive the market value of its investment in return, being left with an expectation for late payment together with interest. The *Tidewater* Award serves to understand that in such cases, adjustments are needed. The Tribunal noted indeed, in further relying on the World Bank Guidelines, that an *ex ante* valuation does not mean that it would be unconcerned with future prospects. In the first place, the factors that a willing buyer would itself take into account when considering the purchase of an investment necessarily include \"the circumstances in which it would operate in the future\". In the second place, the Tribunal, when estimating values *ex ante*, is not required to shut its eyes to events subsequent to the date of injury, if these shed light in more concrete terms on the value applicable at the date of injury or validate the reasonableness of a valuation made at that date75. The Tribunal added, referring to the experts on both sides, that there may in particular cases be a real benefit in hindsight, because it allows for a reliable measurement of lost cash flows between the date of breach and a present date76. This is precisely what an *ex post* valuation allows: taking account of the actual facts that improve the assessment of those retained at the time before the expropriation when they represented mere projections towards a not yet known future. The focus must be on causation, meaning that *ex post* information should not introduce facts into the valuation that have no real connection with the expropriated assets77. However, if such risk exists which may materialize in certain situations, the proper solution has to be found through the correct application of the requirement of causation, including mitigating factors like intervening or concurrent causes, contributory negligence, or proportionality. This element is important and must be added as a factor of adjustment to what may appear extreme in an approach based on an *ex post* valuation. Such valuation, indeed, should not include facts and events that have no reasonable or adequate connection to the investment as it was implemented and conducted at the time of its expropriation. The question whether information or valuation must be determined *ex ante* or *ex post* is not adequately examined and answered without taking into account the interaction between both options through the necessary consideration of causation.\n\n*Tidewater* Award, para. 160.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 162.\n\nThis is the main purpose of Arbitrator Stern in her dissenting opinion (cf. paras. 87-101).\n\n261.\n\nTherefore, an *ex* post valuation must be measured in relation to the content and the terms of the Association Agreement and the whole contractual environment on which the Projects were based. Production, costs, taxes, and all other components of an actual valuation are relevant to the extent only that they are caused or related to the Projects as they were created and conducted at the time when the expropriation occurred. This also means that new or additional production methods, equipments costs, etc. are not to be included in a valuation based on the framework pertinent in the present case when they have as their origin legal undertakings or operational choices that are unrelated to the original Projects.\n\n262.\n\nThis consideration represents the indispensable addition to a debate that simply opposes two different valuation dates. Indeed, if damages have to be evaluated as of a given date, they must be connected by a relation of causality to the injury, *e.g*. the expropriation. From the viewpoint of the date of expropriation, impacts on damages occurring later are taken in consideration if they have a basis in the then existing projections and expectations, which means that they appear as the consequences of such factors. The *ex ante* information sets a bottom line from which the probability of the occurrence of events in the future can be assessed. Viewed from the other perspective, when evaluating damages as of the date of the decision, occurrences of a \"but-for\" nature that are not caused by the project or the legal setting that has been taken away through the expropriation are not included in the valuation. Looked at from one point or the other, the results will coincide in large parts, *i.e.* a valuation including all actual effects caused by the injury, together with all other related effects occurring in the future.\n\nc. The evidence\n---------------\n\n263.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that an *ex post* valuation places the focus on actual terms. However, it cannot be conducted without retaining approximate assumptions and projections. This is easy to understand in relation to future events, mostly relating to production, oil prices, costs and taxes. The situation is not clear cut in actual terms for the historical period since the expropriation and the date of this Award (also called the \"Interim Period\"). In this respect, it is true that theoretically all pertinent actual facts should be available to the Tribunal. This is not the case: Firstly, the Projects have been conducted differently than they would have moved forward had the Association Agreements remained applicable. Secondly, the evidence before this Tribunal is in many respects not representative of the real world or of the \"but-for\" world. The Tribunal must deal with the evidence present on its record, and it cannot rule by reference to evidence the Parties either could not or did not want to submit to the Tribunal.\n\n264.\n\nThe assessment of damages is not an exact science. It is a matter of law, and to the extent the pertinent factors of facts or economics are uncertain or associated with a margin of appreciation, the proper determination is one of the Tribunal's tasks. As stated in Arbitration Rule 34(1), the Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value. The Tribunal is thus granted full discretion in these matters. Such discretion applies also in respect of the weight to be assigned to the evidence proffered in respect of calculation of damages.\n\n265.\n\nOne of the characteristics of an *ex post* valuation is that for easily understandable practical reasons, the date of such valuation cannot be the precise date of the Award. The Tribunal has instructed the Parties in Procedural Order No. 4 to provide their *ex post* valuations on damages updated on 31 December 2016 (para. 6). The Parties have prepared their submissions accordingly. The Tribunal has decided not to ask for a subsequent update, being reluctant to engage in a further delay of the proceeding, and considering that the additional information then provided would not have had a significant impact on the overall assessment of damages78. Therefore, the assessment of relevant evidence between early 2017 and the date of this Award is based on the information and projections available for the preceding period and the up-date requested for 31 December 2016.\n\nThe Respondent has raised an objection at the 2017 September Hearing, claiming for a possibility to provide an updating of relevant facts after 31 December 2016 (TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 4831:15-4833:19, 4901:519 - Preziosi). The Tribunal is not convinced by the pertinence of the argument, further noting that the Respondent had not raised the argument earlier, while it had ample opportunity to do so since 19 August 2016 when Procedural Order No. 4 was issued. See above, two last paragraphs of Section I.\n\n266.\n\nThe evidence in the present case is in large parts based on documents. A certain number of witnesses have submitted statements and have been heard. However, all of them have a limited personal knowledge of the life of the Projects, in particular, Mr. Lyons and Mr. Figuera, the main witnesses of fact presented by the Parties.\n\n267.\n\nMr. Lyons was General Manager of the Petrolera-Ameriven Joint Venture (Hamaca) from August 2003 to August 2005, when he became president of ConocoPhillips Venezuela and involved in Petrozuata as a Board Member and in Corocoro as an Executive, while he remained responsible for Hamaca as a Board Member. He left that function in April 2006 when he was appointed president of ConocoPhillips in Latin America. He served in that capacity until the end of 200879. He retired from ConocoPhillips in 201280. He was co-signatory of the Management Board Resolutions dated 22 May 2007 providing Power of Attorney to Counsel representing the Claimants in this proceeding (C-003).\n\nHe was the signatory of the formal Notice of Dispute submitted to the competent Venezuelan Governmental Authorities on 31 January 2007 (C-36).\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 7, p. 1867-1869; 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3083/84, 3086.\n\n268.\n\nMr. Figuera was president of Petrozuata from January 2005 until December 2006. He was president of Hamaca from June 2006 until the expropriation and then of PetroPiar until December 2007. Since that date, he had no personal involvement in Hamaca or in Petrozuata since he left that company. In December 2007 he became president of PetroSucre until December 2008. In late 2011 he was appointed General Manager of the Jun\u00edn Division, where he remained until late 2013. As he explained to the Tribunal, when he was General Manager, he had no direct oversight over the seven individual Projects that were part of the Division (including Petrozuata). He was not consulted nor did he review documents such as business plans for any project. Therefore, since he left the Projects, he had no personal knowledge and had to talk to people in order to be provided with information81. The actual data he used were given to him by the technical staff from PDVSA82. In his Testimony provided in 2009, Mr. Figuera stated that he was then General Manager of Offshore Joint Ventures of Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana del Petr\u00f3leo S.A. (\"CVP\"), a 100% subsidiary of PDVSA83; in this function, he had indirect involvement in the companies through the Board is-sues84. In 2014, he was Internal Director of this company, responsible among others of PetroSucre that operates the Corocoro field; he was then also Executive Director for new developments in the Orinoco Oil Belt85. In sum, Mr. Figuera did not have personal information to provide evidence as a Witness on facts relating to the operation of the Projects Petrozuata and Hamaca since early 2008.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2251-2265; 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3084-3086, 3236.\n\nTR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2755:12-2756:12.\n\nTestimony, 20 July 2009, para. 1.\n\nTR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3085:21-3086:2.\n\nThird Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 2.\n\n269.\n\nNone of the witnesses was able to testify on actual facts based on personal knowledge and covering the historical period between the expropriation up to 2015 or 2016, and in many cases, the information provided to the Tribunal is based on hearsay or documents gathered from other persons involved in the Projects who have not been asked to appear before this Tribunal. The evidentiary gaps had led some experts to take positions not reflecting the real situation of the Projects and to argue on the basis of assumptions not verified with actual facts, or not supplied with evidence on the Tribunal's record. The Tribunal also noted that the valuation experts on several occasions insisted that their analyses was limited by the instructions provided by their respective instructing Party. The experts' evidence, therefore, requires a close analysis as to its objectivity and reliability.\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the remedy it will retain must be connected to actual facts and reflect the Tribunal's knowledge. The Award \"shall state the reasons upon which it is based\" (Art. 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i)). Members of the Tribunal must be capable of exercising independent judgment (Art. 14(1), 40(2) ICSID Convention). When reading these provisions together, it means that the opinion of experts must be capable of being translated into reasons to be provided by the Tribunal. Such reasons cannot be based, for instance, on mathematical formulae not accompanied by explanations serving as evidence or reasons of law on which an award can be based. The Tribunal cannot reach conclusions based on simple excel-sheets not accompanied by explanations and incapable of being operated on an interactive mode. This is all the more difficult when the response of the experts is limited to stating that the reports have been prepared following a party's instruction. The Tribunal has on several occasions made the Parties aware of such deficiencies.\n\n271.\n\nThe burden of proof is based on two components. One is to determine the party required to submit to the Tribunal evidence relevant for the resolution of the dispute. The other is to identify the party bearing the burden of losing on a submission when the requested evidence has not been brought before this Tribunal. In many cases, but not in all cases, both components identify one and the same party.\n\n272.\n\nThe party making an allegation or an assertion is also the party who should supply the evidence in support of such a submission. It is in most cases also the party who suffers if its submission is not retained by the Tribunal because the required evidence was not presented. As a general matter, it is clear that the Claimants bear the burden of proof in relation to the fact and the amount of loss and damages.\n\n273.\n\nIn the exercise of the discretion granted to it in relation to issues of evidence, the Tribunal requires that the existence of such losses and damages be proven with certainty, together with the associated costs for production. However, a less stringent approach applies when it comes to determine the precise scope and exact quantification of damages, including the estimation of production and costs. In this respect, the Tribunal must take account of the inherent difficulties to prove precise amounts of oil provided through the process of extraction, upgrading and delivery for sale, and to identify all and every single item of costs associated with such process. When the occurrence of certain facts is demonstrated with certainty, their quantification may be assessed when the Tribunal has received information sufficient to show their reliability with reasonable certainty. Some discretion and approximation must be exercised to render possible such assessment of quantified data. When it comes to the valuation of future profits and costs, the Tribunal will focus on the existence of a stream of occurrences demonstrating that such future events will become actual facts with sufficient certainty, and will not award compensation for inherently speculative claims and costs or any other element affecting cash flow.\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal's record contains an unusually high number of situations where one or the other party was not able or claimed not to be in a position to get access to and to supply to the Tribunal information relevant to the resolution of the dispute. The Claimants argued that since they left the Projects they were faced with considerable difficulties in getting access to facts related to the on-going operation of oil production and its costs. The Respondent, on the other hand, did not provide information from individuals that have had, for a number of years in the past and will have in the near future, responsibilities in the conduct of the Projects. No witness with actual knowledge from the sites was called. The Tribunal also noted the absence of any witness representing foreign companies operating in the Orinoco Belt, and in particular from Chevron, a company closely associated with the oil production on site. These difficulties materialize in the present case in particular in relation to the actual operating mode of the Projects and the costs implied since June 2007 and for the rest of the Projects' lifetime.\n\n275.\n\nIn a number of occurrences, the Tribunal will have to simply dismiss allegations that are not supported by sufficient evidence. In other cases, the Tribunal may have to proceed with its own estimates, *e.g.* when future oil prices or costs of wells or turnarounds must be assessed. In certain instances, the inability of a party to provide sufficient evidence may have the effect of shifting the burden of proof, in full or in part, to the other party. This may happen when fairness and good faith require that a party not being able to provide full evidence of an assertion it makes should not stand alone when it can demonstrate that the opposing party has access to or control over the missing evidence. Although the Claimants are correct in stating that they are no longer in an operational position since the expropriation, they retain nevertheless valuable information relating to the Projects as they were in 2007 and they have full professional skill to evaluate the on-going production process and the main categories of costs including their prices today.\n\n276.\n\nThe Respondent has on many occasions produced piles of invoices in exclusively electronic form without providing either any explanation nor any guidance on how to understand hundreds or thousands of documents not identified by consecutive numbering or dates, mostly not referring to the underlying contracts, and in general not completed by indicating whether the amount invoiced has effectively been paid. The Tribunal's role is not to search for evidence the Respondent or its witness or experts undertook without any effort to assist in being comprehensive. In such cases, more supportive demonstration must be required, like explanations about work to be done on particular items of equipment. Particular attention must be given to the risk of overlapping claims or payments, like associated costs claimed in addition to turnaround costs when it appears that what was \"associated\" was in fact included in the turnaround's budget. The Respondent sometimes took the position to offer only minimal information, while more evidence would manifestly have been available; such approach must in the end be detrimental to this Party. For example, the Tribunal also learned with some surprise that the Respondent thought appropriate to include in its Submission on Estimated Costs filed with the Tribunal on 2 June 2017 costs projected in an amount of US$ 512,913,000 for a turnaround to take place the preceding year 201686 that in fact has never been executed that year and that was still uncertain to be executed in September 201787. Under such circumstances, the need for carefully proceeding in assessing data is particularly high.\n\nPage 42. Similarly, the Respondent's Experts Brailovsky/Flores, in their Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation dated 17 November 2016 (paras. 329, 335, 337), presented estimated costs for an \"assumed turnaround in 2016\" of US$ 456.5 million, when they must have known that such turnaround did not take place in 2016.\n\nTR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 4868:10-4869:2 (Preziosi). It was explained that the information was indeed provided in mid-2017 but based on projections dating back in 2015 (*idem*, p. 4870:8-4872:19).\n\n277.\n\nWhen preferring an *ex post* approach to valuation based on actual figures over an *ex ante* valuation using figures, in full or in part, that have proven to be incorrect during the Projects' ongoing operation, the Tribunal does not mean that *ex ante* information available at the time of expropriation or before is entirely irrelevant. It appears indeed on certain occasions that actual information on a particular item is neither available nor reliable. The Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects have been operated differently since 2009, with different outcomes in respect of quality and quantity of production and causing costs not always comparable to those incurred or projected when ConocoPhillips was still an acting partner. Under such circumstances, an assessment of evidence based on Projects as they would have been conducted had the expropriation not occurred, may prove difficult, hypothetical or simply impossible. When weighing the evidence, the Tribunal may in some cases share the view that assumptions made by the Projects' partners before the expropriation were reasonable to such an extent that they can still be used as a reference and as reliable evidence. Such an approach is particularly necessary when the evidence pre-dating the taking in June 2007 was based on common grounds, prepared through the cooperation between all partners and agreed upon by all those attending board meetings, which means in most cases unanimously, except where otherwise stated.\n\n**VI. Production**\n------------------\n\nA. Preliminary Observations\n---------------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe investment at the core of this dispute has been made in three parts, named the Petrozuata, the Hamaca, and the Corocoro Projects. The factual, economic and legal background is different for each of these Projects, while their common feature is that they were all hit by Venezuela's attempt to have them migrated into mixed companies (*empresas mixtas*), followed after the default of such process by the expropriation enforced on 26 June 200788. The Tribunal does not need to repeat the basic features of these Projects, which have been presented in their key-elements in the 2013 Decision. The legal basis for the remedy available to the Claimants has been determined and explained above. The Tribunal turns now to the quantification of damages.\n\nDecree No. 5,200 dated 26 February 2007 (C-5, R-40); Law on the Effects of the Process of Migration into Mixed Companies of the Association Agreements of the Orinoco Oil Belt, dated 11 September 2007 (C-35).\n\n279.\n\nThe Parties strongly disagree on the elements pertinent to the damage calculation. They follow in their presentations a common line of consecutive items to be retained as the key inputs of such calculation. These inputs will also provide guidance for this Award. They are as follows: production, oil prices, costs, taxes, discount rate, interest or update factor. The Parties refer to \"DCF Methodology\". They accept that this methodology uses the same input categories, and that its specificity relates to the discount rate.\n\n280.\n\nThe stream of production can be divided in oil extraction, treatment and upgrading. It is then followed by delivery and sale. The Corocoro Project is different from the two others because of its smaller size, the different quality of the oil and the fact that no upgrading is undertaken. This explains why the process of production of the Petrozuata and the Hamaca Projects is more complex and involves a greater number of issues and technical occurrences to be addressed. Each Project must be examined and evaluated by its own characteristics. The analysis is therefore divided in the three main sections of production (upstream, upgrading, downstream), addressing firstly the Pet-rozuata and Hamaca Projects and secondly the Corocoro Project.\n\n281.\n\nThere is common ground that the Petrozuata Project was designed to extract approximately 120,000 barrels per day (BPD) of extra-heavy crude oil (EHCO) and to upgrade it into 104,000 BPD of synthetic crude (Syncrude or CCO). This syncrude was then sold to ConocoPhillips under an Off-Take Agreement for further refining at its Lake Charles refinery.\n\n282.\n\nThe Petrozuata Association Agreement was first concluded on 10 November 1995 (C-21, p. 277/pdf) between Maraven S.A., a PDVSA affiliate, and Conoco Orinoco, Inc. (which later had its interests transferred to ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. - CPZ), and later amended on 18 June 1997 (C-21, p. 347/pdf). It provided for the establishment of a joint venture company, Petrozuata C.A., which would, by a majority of 50.1%, be owned by the Conoco affiliate. When the Petrozuata upgrader entered into service in April 2001, and the first syncrude sales were made on 12 April, the 35-year term of the Agreement was triggered, which would extend until 11 April 2036.\n\n283.\n\nThe Hamaca Project was designed to produce and upgrade 190,000 BPD of extra-heavy crude oil, and to sell the resulting 180,000 BPD of syncrude and other By-products to international markets.\n\n284.\n\nThe Hamaca Association Agreement was signed on 9 July 1997 (C-22, R-26) by Corpogua-nipa S.A. (on behalf of Corpoven, a subsidiary of PDVSA), ARCO and Texaco affiliates, and Phillips Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited (which later had its ownership transferred to ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. - CPH). It provided for the Project to be structured as an unincorporated joint venture; the Phillips Company owned 40% of the Hamaca Project89, while the subsidiaries of PDVSA and Chevron each owned a 30% interest. The exploitation of the field would extend until 8 July 2037.\n\nThe initial participation of 20% was raised to 40% by means of Amendment No. 2 to the Hamaca Association Agreement, dated 28 June 1999 (C-22, p. 818/pdf).\n\n285.\n\nThe Corocoro Project operated on the basis of an amended Development Plan of 2005 (C181) that projected production of 30,000 BPD of light and medium crude oil in the offshore New Areas in the Gulf of Paria beginning in the summer of 2007, with production rising close to 70,000 BPD when the Central Production Facility came online at a projected date in late 2008.\n\n286.\n\nThe Corocoro Association Agreement was concluded on 10 July 1996 providing a 39-year term and for Conoco Venezuela B.V. to be the operator (C-23, R-29). Conoco Venezuela B.V. (which later had its ownership interest transferred to ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. - CGP) held 32.2075% in the Project, alongside with CVP, a PDVSA subsidiary (35%), Eni (25.8%) and two smaller investors, OPIC and Ineparia (7%).\n\n287.\n\nA number of issues are of a general nature and suited to be examined independently from specifics of a particular Project (B). They will be addressed first, in respect of Petrozuata and Hamaca, before the focus will turn to each of these Projects separately (C and D), followed by an examination of the operation of the upgraders (E) and a conclusion (F). As mentioned, Corocoro deserves a special section (G). A final point relates to By-products (H).\n\nB. The Main Features of Production of Petrozuata and Hamaca\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nOne of the main areas of dispute is the assessment of the production profiles to be retained for the post-expropriation period, both between July 2007 and end 2016, and from early 2017 until the end of the lifetime of each of the Projects (Petrozuata and Hamaca). The experts on each side presented analysis based on very different assumptions. Different operating objectives are a matter of debate, together with the migration companies' skill for running efficiently the sites and the business as a whole. When lower production volumes are discussed, the issue then coming up as a reflex relates to the quantities of oil remaining available in the future (the Reserves), either until the end of the Projects' operation or until the time of complete exhaustion of the fields.\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n289.\n\nThe Claimants explain that their valuation experts, Dr. Abdala and Prof. Spiller, have relied on the oil production profiles endorsed by all of the Project participants, including PDVSA, immediately prior to the expropriation. They reflect what the disputing parties both agreed upon what was likely to be achieved. That is particularly appropriate where, as here, the pre-expropriation profiles are confirmed by highly persuasive evidence - the Projects' Reserves figures. Those figures are a uniquely reliable measure of an oil field's value, because they reflect the best current knowledge about the geological and economic properties of a reservoir.\n\n290.\n\nVenezuela offers in respect of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects only the made-for-arbi-tration assertions of its fact witness, Mr. Figuera, and the models of its technical expert, Mr. Pati\u00f1o. Venezuela's quantum experts in turn rely on their reports for the production profiles they plug into their damages calculation. Venezuela's made-for-arbitration production profiles must be rejected.\n\n291.\n\nFirst, the diminished production estimates put forward by Venezuela are contradicted by the most powerful evidence: the Proved Reserves figures. Such Reserves are, by definition, the volumes of oil that are nearly certain to be recovered under existing economic and operating conditions. Venezuela puts forward an extraordinary contradiction: according to its published Proved Reserves figures, the fields are now capable of producing much more oil than at the time of the taking, while according to the profiles presented in this arbitration, the Projects are capable of producing less and less. This makes no sense.\n\n292.\n\nSecond, to the extent that extra-heavy crude oil (EHCO) production at the Projects has actually declined since the expropriation, then the only explanation would be PDVSA's poor postexpropriation management of the Projects.\n\n293.\n\nThird, Venezuela's production forecasts are unreliable. For the period from 2009 to the end of the Projects terms, Venezuela relies not on actual EHCO production data, but on theoretical models for Petrozuata and Hamaca created by Mr. Pati\u00f1o. For the historical period (January 2009-December 2015), Mr. Pati\u00f1o excludes tens of millions of barrels of EHCO that according to PDVSA's own documents were in fact produced during that period. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's forecasts of future production rest on inadequate methodology, as the Claimants' expert, Dr. Strickland, has explained.\n\na. The oil production profiles\n------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nThe damages awarded in this case must restore the Claimants to the position that they would have enjoyed in the but-for world, in which the expropriation did not occur. Consistent with this principle, the Claimants' experts have relied on conservative oil production profiles contained in each Project's pre-expropriation business planning documents. These profiles reflect the Project participants' shared expectations about the level of oil production that would be achieved in the future. International tribunals have routinely relied upon such forecasts.\n\n295.\n\nThe experts follow the approach described above, adopting forecasts as follows: (a) for Petrozuata, the remaining EHCO recovery between June 2007 and 2036 is 913.5 million barrels; (b) for Hamaca, the remaining EHCO recovery between June 2007 and 2037 is 1,894 billion barrels.\n\nb. The expected oil production based on the Reserves figures\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Reserves figures are uniformly used to quantify the volumes of oil that are expected to be recovered from specific oil reservoirs. Under the SEC regulations, Reserves are divided in three categories: Proved (1P), Proved plus Probable (2P), and Proved plus Probable plus Possible (3P). Proved Reserves (1P) represent the most cautious \"low estimate scenario\" for actual production from a given field. 2P Reserves represent the \"best estimate scenario\", while 3P Reserves represent the \"high estimate scenario\" (CL-343). International tribunals rely upon Reserves figures. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Venezuela and PDVSA likewise use functionally identical definitions.\n\n297.\n\nIn the present case, Venezuela's own Proved Reserves figures put to rest any doubt that the Claimants' oil production profiles were, and remain, achievable. Those figures - which have been increasing since the expropriation - confirm to a \"reasonable certainty\" that there is more than enough recoverable EHCO, to an extent exceeding the pre-expropriation forecasts used by the Claimants. The Ministry of Energy and Oil reported Proved Reserves at Petrozuata to be 2.4 billion barrels of EHCO in 2006 (C-404). Its most recent published figure, in 2010, is 3.9 billion barrels (C-623). Nothing has been published since then. In 2006, the figure for Hamaca was 3.6 billion (C404), and for 2015 4.6 billion (CLEX-090).\n\n298.\n\nThe Respondent argues that these figures are not comparable to the oil production profiles in this arbitration. First, Venezuela argues that the Ministry's Proved Reserves are calculated for the life of the fields, rather than for the contractual terms of specific projects. However, the argument fails by the definition of Proved Reserves, also agreed to by Venezuela. Such Reserves refer to EHCO volumes that are virtually certain to be recovered under \"prevailing conditions\", which means that they are actually recoverable and certainly before the end of the Projects. Second, Venezuela argues that the Reserves figures published by the Ministry include additional volumes of oil recoverable when using enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques, such as steam injections. If such volumes of recoverable oil reserves have been included in the Ministry's counting, then the same techniques had been available to the Claimants in the but-for scenario as well. Third, Venezuela appears to suggest that Proved Reserves figures may be higher for the owner of the natural resource (the State), on the ground that it is not concerned with the payment of taxes and royalties. Venezuela had offered no evidence in this respect. In any event, PDVSA pays the same royalties and taxes as private oil companies in Venezuela.\n\n299.\n\nVenezuela's post-expropriation Proved Reserves figures show that the Petrozuata and Hamaca fields remain more than capable of producing the volumes of EHCO used in Claimants' damages model. Furthermore, the Proved Reserves figures have been increasing since the expropriation, which contradicts Venezuela's position that the production volumes have decreased as time has passed by.\n\nc. Venezuela's made-for-arbitration production forecasts\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Respondent bases its case on production profiles prepared for the purposes of this arbitration by its technical expert, Mr. Pati\u00f1o. They were then plugged into Brailovsky & Flores damages calculation. If applied, they would reduce the value of the Projects by nearly US$ 6.9 billion, compared to the production profiles used by the Claimants' experts.\n\n301.\n\nThe Respondent employs a two-step approach: (a) with respect to the historical period (2007-2015), Venezuela relies on what it says the \"actual\" performance has been. This is in two parts: (i) for the period 26 June 2007 through the end of 2008, Venezuela uses the actual volumes of EHCO produced by the Projects, as reported by PDVSA, while (ii) for the period from 1 January 2009 through 31 December 2015, Venezuela relies on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's calculation of the volumes of EHCO that would have been required to produce the amounts of syncrude that were actually sold by the post-expropriation Projects. (b) With respect to the future period (from 1 January 2016 through the end of the Association Agreements), Venezuela relies upon the theoretical production forecasts created by Mr. Pati\u00f1o.\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the post-expropriation performance of the Projects, under PDVSA's stewardship, cannot be taken as reflecting the performance that would have been achieved had the expropriation not occurred. The Claimants have no means to test or verify that information. Even if the \"actual\" results reported by Venezuela would be accurate, they are not reflective of what would have been achieved had the expropriation not occurred. First, the alleged lower production volumes are not consistent with the Ministry's Proved Reserves figures. Those figures reflect the amounts of oil that a competent operator would extract under presently existing conditions, and they considerably exceed the oil volumes used in the Claimants' damages calculations. Second, since the expropriation, all three Projects have been majority-owned and controlled by PDVSA, which has different priorities and capabilities. According to the Claimants, beginning in the early 2000s, PDVSA has been transformed from a commercially-oriented company into an arm of the Venezuelan State. Its priorities have been shifted and its performance has suffered. The government has, for example, increasingly used PDVSA as a \"cash cow\" to fund its social programs. All Projects suffered from an exodus of experienced employees caused by the expropriation of the Orinoco Belt and New Areas Projects.\n\n303.\n\nWhile the post-expropriation oil production alleged by the Respondent cannot be verified, the profiles for the remainder of the historical period - from 2009 to 2015 - are more egregious still. For this period, Venezuela does not refer to actual volumes of EHCO, but on hypothetical volumes of EHCO that would have been required to produce the volumes of syncrude that Venezuela says were sold by the Projects during that period. In fact, actual EHCO production has far outstripped the EHCO volumes retained for the Respondent's damages calculation. Venezuela thus ignores its own data, showing approximately 97 million barrels of \"lost oil\", worth approximately US$ 7.5 billion.\n\n304.\n\nVenezuela attempts to justify its disregard of these lost oil volumes by claiming that as from 2009, PetroAnzo\u00e1tegui and PetroPiar produced large amounts of EHCO that were not upgraded to syncrude, but rather sold in blended (not-upgraded) form (DCO and blended crude). Venezuela argues that the pre-expropriation Projects were not allowed to sell those products, and that therefore the Claimants can get no credit for those blended EHCO volumes in this arbitration. Even if this would be correct, Venezuela's assertion shows, firstly, that PDVSA's post-expropriation strategies and priorities differ from those agreed by all the Project participants prior to the expropriation. Indeed, in such a post-expropriation scenario, the incentive to maintain upgrader performance would have been reduced, because it was still possible to sell non-upgraded products. Secondly, the but-for scenario must be modeled on the basis of the pre-expropriation plans, as they had been endorsed by PDVSA.\n\n305.\n\nIn any event, Venezuela's claim that the pre-expropriation Projects were prohibited from selling non-upgraded products is false. Venezuela relies on a June 2005 letter from the Ministry (Appendix 1 to Dr. Mommer's Testimony). On a closer look, the letter was in fact a demand that the Projects pay higher royalties on non-upgraded volumes of EHCO. The Projects were never prevented from producing blended crude: (a) both Projects produced and sold blended crude oil before the June 2005 letter; (b) the Ministry was fully aware of this; (c) both Projects continued to produce and sell blended products after June 2005; and (d) there were no occasions in the preexpropriation period when either Project was prohibited or prevented from producing and selling blended crude. It cannot be suggested that the Projects would have been prevented from producing and selling blended crude oil in the but-for scenario. However, they would not have made such a choice: they would have upgraded those additional crude oil volumes, thereby maximizing the value obtained from them.\n\n306.\n\nWith respect to the future period, *i.e.* from 1 January 2016 onward, Venezuela relies on the production forecasts created by Mr. Pati\u00f1o. He determined for each Project an annual decline rate, at which the wells in each field will produce less oil over time. The Claimants note in this regard that where the pre-expropriation Projects used more advanced tools, Mr. Pati\u00f1o's decline curve methodology is inappropriate and ultimately irrelevant. It is also clear that Mr. Pati\u00f1o's simple decline rate methodology could only be used to evaluate a small minority of the wells at both fields. Mr. Pati\u00f1o did not undertake the most basic reality check. He did not attempt to (i) reconcile his pessimistic forecasts against the far larger Proved Reserves figures published by the Ministry and PDVSA; (ii) compare his model's results to the long-term production forecasts prepared by the Projects since the expropriation; or (iii) test his forecasts against the actual EHCO production from the fields for past periods covered by those forecasts. The reports of the Claimants' expert, Dr. Strickland, reveal these and other fundamental flaws in Mr. Pati\u00f1o's analysis, including the erroneous conflation of different types of wells.\n\nd. PDVSA's poor management\n--------------------------\n\n307.\n\nThe Claimants observe that PDVSA's practices and competencies became substantially different from those of the Projects' prior management, before the takings. In 2003 already, the government fired thousands of PDVSA's most experienced engineers and managers, and replaced them with political loyalists. Another wave of losses of experienced senior employees occurred in 2007. PDVSA offered substantially lower salaries to the Venezuelan personnel. Mismanagement and corruption have been documented in Venezuela and the United States.\n\n308.\n\nIn support of PDVSA's post-expropriation performance at the Projects, the Respondent argues that Chevron remained a shareholder and is a competent commercial organization. Yet the suggestion ignores that since the takings, PDVSA owns the entirety of what was the Petrozuata Project, and 70% of what was Hamaca. The governance structure of the companies has changed. While the Respondent further argues that Chevron retains a significant role on maintenance activities at Hamaca, it has produced no evidence to that effect, beyond Mr. Figuera's unsubstantiated assertions.\n\n*2. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimants' starting points for the extra-heavy crude oil upgrading Projects are (i) for Petrozuata, the October 2006 ConocoPhillips (COP) Composite Economic Model (CEM, LECG-085, BF-412), and (ii) for Hamaca, the October 2006 Petrolera Ameriven Hamaca Economic Model (AEM or PAM, LECG-129, BF-411). Both Projects have produced less oil than Claimants have projected. The Petrozuata Project suffers due to a high decline rate, the lack of good well targets and the low initial production of the wells. The Hamaca Project has suffered due to enormous problems at the upgrader, resulting in an average OSF of only 71.37%. These issues are detailed in the Third Supplemental Direct Testimony of Rub\u00e9n Figuera and the Expert Report of Jesus Pati\u00f1o, which form the basis for the valuation carried out by Mr. Vladimir Brailovsky and Dr. Daniel Flores.\n\n310.\n\nThe Claimants use virtually the same production and costs in their *ex post* valuations as they do in their *ex ante* valuations. The only difference is the inflation index; the underlying costs are exactly the same. However, those *ex ante* data bear no relationship to what actually happened in the Projects after the nationalization. While such data may have been appropriate to account for information that a reasonably informed buyer would have known as of the date of the nationalization, in an *ex post* valuation as of 31 December 2016, what actually transpired in the historical period must be taken into account.\n\n311.\n\nThe Respondent also reacts to the Claimants when they argue that they do not have to take into account the performance of the Projects under the operatorship of companies in which they are not participants. They contend that post-expropriation is essentially irrelevant to the \"but-for\" analysis, because they were entitled to compensation based on the manner in which the fields would have been operated had the Claimants not been dispossessed.\n\n312.\n\nThe Respondent further highlights the confusion entertained by the Claimants when referring to the Ministry reserves in this context. EHCO production volumes for the term of a project with a finite life using cold production techniques are not comparable to the volumes that Venezuela expects to be achieved over the entirety of the life of the field, both under cold production and using EOR techniques.\n\na. The oil production profiles\n------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe Respondent has demonstrated precisely what the production and sales of CCO achieved by the upgrading Projects Petrozuata (now PetroAnzo\u00e1tegui) and Hamaca (now PetroPiar) have been during the historical period90. What the Respondent did was to properly assess the performance those Projects would likely have achieved in the historical period had the associations remained in place. Thus, the Respondent started with the actual CCO sales as the basis for the calculations, since the oil product the Petrozuata and Hamaca associations were permitted to sell was upgraded crude oil. The Respondent has estimated (not \"projected\") the volumes of EHCO that would have been required to achieve the actual CCO sales volumes realized in the historical period. In short, the Respondent started with the relevant actual performance data, namely CCO sales, and estimated from there EHCO production volumes and related costs that would have been incurred in a world in which the associations had persisted. The only \"projecting\" that the Respondent did was in connection with the future EHCO and CCO production, where projections are required, since the actual facts are not known.\n\nCf. Invoices in Figuera Appendices 42, 81, 104, 105; Reports in Figuera Appendices 106, 107, 108, 109, Pati\u00f1o Appendix 46.\n\n314.\n\nThe Respondent has established what the actual sales of CCO at PetroAnzo\u00e1tegui and PetroPiar have been during the historical period and that those are the results that would in all likelihood have prevailed in a world in which ConocoPhillips participated in the Projects. It is the Claimants' burden to establish that the Projects would have achieved better results than those obtained by the post-nationalization companies if the associations had remained in place. But the Claimants' *ex post* valuations, which are premised on long outdated models that were prepared in 2006, ignore the real world and the historical realities of the Projects.\n\n315.\n\nThe Respondent's presentation of the potential EHCO production from the fields is based on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's expert study. He had proceeded with a detailed examination of a selection of representative wells with the aim of determining the overall production capabilities of the fields. Based on this analysis he determined an overall decline rate of the wells between 20 and 22%. He concluded that the fields would run out of targets for new drills much sooner than this was projected, and that therefore the total production of EHCO would be significantly lower than the volumes the Claimants contend to extract from the grounds. This will be demonstrated in respect of each Project separately.\n\nb. The expected oil production based on the Reserves figures\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nThe production profiles used by the parties necessarily assume production only for the terms of the Projects. Neither party has assumed that EOR techniques, with the associated costs, would be employed at either Petrozuata or Hamaca. The Ministry Reserves assume production over the entire life of the fields and the implementation of EOR techniques that would increase the recovery factor to an assumed 20% rate against the original oil in place (OOIP) calculated at the outset of the Projects.\n\n317.\n\nThe Claimants argue that both categories of Reserves are defined to mean volumes that are commercially recoverable under existing economic and operational conditions. They ignore the distinction between production volumes that can be expected over the course of a period of approximately 30 years using primary production methods alone and the production that can be expected over the life of the oil fields using all known methods that would available for Venezuela (as opposed to a Project company). Mr. Figuera explained that the Ministry-approved Reserves assume that the wells will continue to produce oil, even at a lower and lower rate. They also assume that additional wells that are economically attractive to the country will be drilled in due time, and that EOR techniques ultimately will be employed over the life of the field. Mr. Figuera's basic point is that reserves for a country, as the owner of the resources, will invariably be higher than the reserves for a particular project of a finite term. This is so, not only because the country can use recovery methods that may not be attractive to a project participant, but also because the resource owner, producing through its national oil company, benefits from the entirety of the revenues realized on the production.\n\n318.\n\nThe Respondent refers to a presentation from Petrolera Ameriven to CVP from November 2006 distinguishing between a recovery factor of 5.4% of the OOIP for the 35-year life of the Hamaca Project, while the same factor applied to the life of the Huyapari field through 2150 was estimated at 11.7%91. This means that this field would produce more than twice as much EHCO as was estimated for the life of the Hamaca Project using cold production techniques alone. The Respondent also recalls that each of PDVSA's yearly management reports stated that the Reserves set forth therein are for the life of the field and are based on ultimate production using EOR techniques, as for instance in the 2008 Report (CLEX 39).\n\nFiguera Appendix 75.\n\n319.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that the Claimants would never have implemented EOR at the Projects had they remained participants. Even if certain areas of both of the Projects' fields could potentially be exploited using EOR techniques, such hypothesis is irrelevant, since such techniques were never seriously considered and, in any event, neither Party is assuming the implementation of such techniques in this arbitral proceeding. Witness Brown explained that ConocoPhillips had suggested the use of steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) when Petrozuata was designing its first EOR pilot study in 2005. Neither he nor the Claimants mention that the SAGD project under consideration at Petrozuata was to be implemented only in a particular portion of the Petrozuata field's reserve area with sands having a then-estimated thickness of at least 40 feet, and that it was to use only single-lateral wells. They do not address either Mt. Lyons' statement at the 2010 hearing that there was not a high degree of confidence that such a project would work at Petrozuata. Even if the SAGD project had been implemented, it would only have been expected to contribute 20,000 BPD of EHCO starting in 2015, at the earliest, at a cost of more than US$ 1 billion92. EOR was rejected by ConocoPhillips as uneconomic (C-333). The Claimants have never addressed the costs associated with EOR Projects, which involve massive up-front capital expenditures.\n\nFiguera Appendix 80.\n\n320.\n\nIn sum, the Respondent concludes that there is no connection between the Ministry Reserves and the production volumes that can be achieved under cold production during the terms of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects. The Claimants' reliance on Ministry Reserves is nothing more than a smokescreen. What is impossible to understand is that if there is more than enough oil for the Projects to produce, why does the Claimants' own production profile for Petrozuata drop off the cliff in 2023, and why does the Claimants' own production profile for Hamaca fall off starting in 2031. The Claimants obviously cut their own production profiles because the fields simply cannot produce more, and, in fact, will produce less under cold production.\n\nc. The control over the Projects\n--------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimants' assertion that their continuing involvement on the sites would have contributed to raise production and improve performance of the Projects. In the post-nationalization period, as before, the PDVSA subsidiary would have held the position of control. Article 5 of the 1975 Nationalization Law provided for the control through the State company and this was retained in both the Congressional Authorizations for Petrozuata and Hamaca. Thus, nothing of significance at either of the Projects could be accomplished unless and until the PDVSA subsidiary gave its approval, and this would have been true for the associations post-nationalization as before. Witness Lyons acknowledged the control held by the PDVSA subsidiaries in the Projects.\n\n322.\n\nThe Claimants have never been able to explain why it should be assumed that at a project like Hamaca, the presence of a handful of ConocoPhillips secondees would have dramatically changed the results achieved in the post-nationalization period. At PetroPiar, Chevron personnel have, since the nationalization, held key positions in upgrader projects and technical management, maintenance, engineering and construction and drilling; they have been responsible for all of the major maintenance activities, including the 2009 turnaround, the combined turnaround/PRAC (Restoration Plan for Critical Assets) in 2012, and the series of PREMs (Restoration Plans for Major Equipment) starting in 2012.\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\na. The relevance of actual production figures\n---------------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal will analyze the production for each Project separately. As this has been explained above, it will rely on actual figures as much as they are available and based on reliable evidence. However, such approach is possible to the extent only that the Project's operation since the expropriation remains close to the characteristics that would have been prevailing had the Association Agreements not been extinguished. The main concern in this respect relates to the actual figures and forecasts presented by the Respondent since the year 2009.\n\nb. The production forecasts as from 2009\n----------------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Projects' production of oil was much lower than what had been projected. In support of its submission, the Respondent used actual performance data, namely CCO sales, and estimated EHCO production volumes and related costs that would have been incurred in a world in which the associations had persisted93.\n\nThe contracts on migration provided that the upgrading of extra-heavy oil was not the exclusive production, the mixed company further selling other hydrocarbons (cf. Article 3 of the contract for Hamaca dated 5 December 2007, R-45, and the draft of 17 January 2007, C-31, respectively for Petrozuata dated 22 January 2007, C-32).\n\n325.\n\nHowever, this presentation, further explained above, is not correct. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's available EHCO production was based on a retro-calculation from what he understood as the maximum quantities of oil capable of being extracted by the wells actually in place and later to be drilled. The EHCO quantities he retained for this purpose were admittedly lower than what he considered as the quantities of EHCO that were accessible on the fields and capable of being extracted if the required wells would have been available, which, in his opinion, was not the case.\n\n326.\n\nThe Respondent provided little explanation about the split operated as from 2009 between the production of syncrude or CCO, and the selling of blended oil. Albeit not supported by comments and focused evidence, the Respondent's statement is clear:\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o's production capacity programs at both Petrozuata and Hamaca begin on January 1, 2009 because in 2009, the post-nationalization companies began to operate in a manner that was inconsistent with the pre-nationalization association model in that they produced and sold (or exchanged with other mixed companies) blended products, activities in which the associations were not authorized to engage. In the post-nationalization period pre-dating January 1, 2009, the mixed companies produced and sold only CCO and, accordingly, the actual performance in that period represents what the performance would most likely have been had the associations remained in place94.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o made a similar statement:\n\nMy production capacity programs were based exclusively on EHCO volumes required to achieve actual CCO production and sales in the historical period (and, therefore, excluded EHCO volumes used to produce blended products that the Projects under the association model were not authorized to sell). Since those volumes are less than actual EHCO production volumes achieved in the historical period, I also adjusted the well-drilling programs at the Projects to match those reduced volumes of EHCO, thereby eliminating costs in the historical period that the associations would have been able to avoid by deferring EHCO production capacity from which they could not have benefitted. The EHCO that was produced in the historical period but which would have been of no use to the associations was therefore excluded from the historical period and, instead, moved to the future (projection) period, along with corresponding costs, when the EHCO could be used by the associations had they remained in place95.\n\nRespondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 317.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o's Consolidated Report (footnote 31). When referring to this note, the Respondent understood that the EHCO produced and used in the period starting on 1 January 2009 for production of blended products \"is assumed to remain in the ground until needed for CCO production\" (Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 317 *in fine*). Such assumption is purely theoretical and has nothing to do with the actual life of the fields.\n\n327.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o as an expert could not provide witness testimony in this respect. He has not been contradicted by the Respondent. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's expertise was based on quantities of EHCO supplied to the upgraders substantially lower than what has been provided before 2009. He thus incorporated in his examination the decrease in EHCO available for the production of upgraded syncrude. In so proceeding, he did not rely on the quantities of EHCO that have been extracted and shifted to the upgraders before 2009 when the Projects were operated as designed by the participants acting under the Association Agreements. He further told the Tribunal that his study and his instructions were different from the methodology currently existing at the Projects96.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2575:1-2577:12.\n\n328.\n\nThe same reduced figures then served Mr. Figuera's presentation that he brought before this Tribunal for the first time with his Third Supplementary Testimony. However, his testimony is not based on personal knowledge, as he had left the Projects long before 2009. He further demonstrated that his information was provided to him from external sources (basically Mr. Pati\u00f1o), because it was completely absent from the statements he had submitted to the Tribunal before. Furthermore, his new figures are inconsistent with those contained in his prior witness statements.\n\n329.\n\nMr. Figuera's interpretation of the shift that occurred as from 2009 in the production volumes provided to the upgraders is different from Mr. Pati\u00f1o's and the Respondent's statement. Indeed, for Mr. Figuera, when the Projects began using excess EHCO for the sale of DCO or other blended products, \"this was due to the chronically low OSF at the Hamaca upgrader and to certain events at Petrozuata that also reduced upgrader throughput\"97. Thus, Mr. Figuera reversed the chain of causality: reduction in EHCO quantities provided to the upgrader was not the consequence of the choice to sell blended oil, but the effect of access restrictions to the upgrader expressed by its low OSF. However, Mr. Figuera does not provide any element of information on actual facts in support of his assertion. The sudden shift he observed starting in 2009 has no explanation based on the timeline of events: in the second half of 2007 and the year 2008, the upgraders were operating correctly and complying with the parameters for EHCO to CCO throughputs as before. Witness Figuera testified that in the second half of 2007 and in 2008 no blended oil (DCO or Merey 16) was produced at Hamaca or Petrozuata98. The shift to sell blended oil occurred in 2009. An upgrader's quality assessment cannot show a sudden \"jump\" from 79% to 60% OSF from 2008 to 2009, without any operational explication other than the volume of EHCO provided to the upgrader. No change has been reported in relation to the performance of the upgrader. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that the volumes of incoming EHCO and outgoing CCO were reduced because of a limited availability of the upgraders that would have had equally materialized under the operation based on the Association Agreements99. Mr. Figuera adopted Mr. Pati\u00f1o's figures and his approach based on decline rates. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's conclusion in respect of the limited output of the upgraders was based on his understanding of the EHCO production from the fields and not on the examination of the upgraders' performance that he had not done. It is instructive to observe the figures he lists as conclusion of his analysis of the upgraders' performance100: First, the expert identifies the possible EHCO production to the upgrader as the result of his analysis of the available EHCO in the fields; and then, second, he calculates the out coming CCO by using the yield factor exclusively, as if the upgrader would operate at a 100% OSF101. The Respondent102 and its valuation experts103 have reproduced the same numbers.\n\nFourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, para. 21.\n\nFourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, para. 21, footnote 46.\n\nWitness Sheets explained that it is more expensive to refine heavy crude than light sweet crude. \"For this reason, if the differential between heavy and light crude drops sufficiently, at some point it becomes economically justified for refiners to convert heavy oil refining capacity back to regular light oil refining capacity (termed \"loafing\" the coking facility). This point may be reached when the differential falls to just a few dollars.\" (Witness Statement, 30 October 2009, para. 22).\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 116, 193.\n\nFor instance, for Petrozuata and for 2017, an EHCO production to the upgrader is determined at 86,829 BPD, yielding 74,855 CCO, which is the result of the yield factor of 0.8621. For the same year, at Hamaca, 143,432 BPD of EHCO produce 135,256 CCO, a result obtained through the yield factor of 0,947. No impact of a reduced OSF has been measured in these calculations.\n\nRespondent's Final Brief on Quantum, paras. 325, 363.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 246-249, 259.\n\n330.\n\nThese basic elements of the Respondent's production figures will be analyzed in more detail below.\n\n331.\n\nThe Respondent has not submitted testimony on this matter before this Tribunal. The Tribunal assumes that this could have been done easily by calling personnel responsible for the operation of the sites conducted by PDVSA and thus under the State's control. The evidence before the Tribunal is therefore based in significant parts on documents relating to sales of oil. These sales are in two parts. The greater part relates to invoices and sales of CCO. The smaller part is about the sale of blended oil, which means oil not upgraded and sold as quantities of EHCO combined with naphtha (DCO) or with Mesa (resulting in Merey 16), usually in a proportion of 76.67% to 23.33%.\n\n332.\n\nThe Respondent objected to the use of any figure relating to blended oil, arguing that the Projects were not permitted to deal with such oil, as they were under an obligation to produce syncrude exclusively104. The latter observation is correct, subject to an examination of the question whether the Projects were permitted to sell blended oil during turnovers. The main parts of the 23 June 2005 letter of the Ministry of Energy and Mines concerning Hamaca105 read as follows:\n\nTHIRD: The blending of extra-heavy hydrocarbons is only envisaged in the pre-operating phases, but not in subsequent exploitation phases. The blending of extra-heavy hydrocarbons during the periods which correspond to the plant shut-down is not authorized in the decision of the Congress of the Republic and in the Bicameral Commission's Report.\n\nFOURTH: The activities carried out or the situations created during the exploitation of extra-heavy crude in the Orinoco Oil Belt that exceed the limit of the decision of the Congress of the Republic, shall be considered outside the framework of that decision. Accordingly, it shall be understood that the aforementioned activities and situations are subject to the provisions of the law in force, especially to those [provisions] of the Decree with Force of Organic Law of Hydrocarbons, dated November 13, 2001.\n\nThe fifth paragraph further explains that the volumes of hydrocarbons that exceed the monthly average production of MBD that was approved by the Congress shall be subject to the 30% royalty rate set forth by the aforesaid law, and that this also applied in cases of volumes related to the blending of extra-heavy crudes. It was also stated that the payment of such royalties does not legitimize the excesses identified and does not imply an authorization for such activities.\n\nCf. Hamaca Congressional Authorization, Tenth Condition (R-93); Hamaca Association Agreement (Sec. 6.2).\n\nTestimony of Dr. Mommer, Appendix 1, including a nearly identical letter send to Petrozuata the same day (also C-217, R-199).\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal understands this last paragraph as being directed essentially to the royalty rate, which shall be the regular rate of 30% in the case of any excess production running over the volume of 197 MBD of extra-heavy crude. Blending of extra-heavy oil was not prohibited during shut-downs, but tolerated. As stated in paragraph 4, such production was outside the activity governed by the Association Agreement. Article 1 of the Hamaca Agreement defines \"Commercial Production\" as \"the upgraded oil produced by the upgrading of Extra-Heavy Oil\", whereas Article 1 of the Petrozuata Agreement states that the \"Project\" relates to the production and upgrading of extra-heavy oil; blended oil is not included in these definitions106. Therefore, the quantities of blended oil that ConocoPhillips allegedly had produced and sold and later envisaged to provide in by-passing the upgrader during turnarounds were not covered by the scope of application of the Association Agreements. They were nonetheless part of the \"taking\", because they represented assets and interests that were included in the scope of the expropriation based on Article 2 of the Law on the Effects of the Process of Migration into Mixed Companies of the Association Agreements of the Orinoco Oil Belt of 11 September 2007 (C-35).\n\nFor the same reason, the Respondent's experts explained that the Hamaca compensation provision that is based on revenues from commercial production could not apply to an activity such as blending; TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 6, p. 1669:20-1670:8 (Flores).\n\n334.\n\nThe main part of the Respondent's argument in respect of blending, however, is wrong. The Tribunal does not consider relevant the actual or future sales of blended oil. It only notes, and considers this important, that there were substantial quantities of EHCO available to allow selling considerable amounts of barrels of blended oil since 2009. The Respondent noted that at Petrozuata \"a significant volume of blended products\" was sold107. The situation was the same at Hamaca108. Had the Association Agreements remained in place, such EHCO would not have been used for the purpose of blending, but it would have been included in the process of upgrading and be added to the quantities of oil sold as CCO.\n\nRespondent's Cost Estimation for Petrozuata, p. 7, 72, 73; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 14, p. 4269:18-4270:3, 4290:9-13 (Preziosi).\n\nRespondent's Cost Estimation for Hamaca, p. 7, 76, 97.\n\n335.\n\nIn light of the omission to take account of the EHCO available for blending, the quantities of EHCO referred to by Mr. Pati\u00f1o and Mr. Figuera are not reliable for the determination of the CCO production as it would have been possible had the Projects remained as they were under the Association Agreements. It would seem that Mr. Pati\u00f1o was aware of this difference in counting, because he also listed the amounts of EHCO potentially extractable. However, he did not use these figures, and Mr. Figuera and the Respondent and its experts ignored them. They will come back in the Tribunal's analysis below.\n\n336.\n\nThe Tribunal finds, however, that the Claimants' presentation is not accurate either. The quantities of oil that have been reported on the Tables submitted on 20 March 2017 as \"blended\" are not accounted for in the Claimants' models and documentation as having such characteristic (composed of EHCO and naphtha or another diluent). The Claimants add in a comment to their Tables that the source for such \"blended\" oil has to be found under \"ECHO by-pass\"109. The Claimants' Replies of 10 July 2017 affirm that the production of blended oil has been reflected in preexpropriation business plans110, however without demonstrating convincingly that such production consisted of more than simple EHCO by-passing the upgrader. The models and the Claimants' experts' accounts determine quantities of \"EHCO by-pass\" during turnaround years. Contrary to the Claimants' assertion, the term \"blended oil\" is not used in this connection; \"EHCO by-pass\" is EHCO and not \"blended oil\". The Composite Economic Model (CEM) of 2006 records, for instance, 2,400,000 million barrels (MMB) as \"EHCO By-pass\" for each turnaround year at Petro-zuata, whereas the line labeled \"(Blend (Zuata 9 - Naphtha)\" is completely empty111. For Hamaca, the main figure is 2,880,000, also under the heading \"EHCO By-Pass\" (there is no mention of blend)112. Consistently, there is, for Petrozuata, no cost item relating to the 23.33% naphtha component of blended oil113; for Hamaca, costs for \"Naphtha-Make-up\" are noted but such expense appears as projection and not relevant for oil sold as EHCO114. The Claimants' experts account for EHCO by-pass in turnaround years, combined with prices relating to EHCO sold (neither CCO, nor blended oil). On the other hand, the total volume of 913,5 million barrels claimed as the Claimants' loss for Petrozuata's post-expropriation period includes a volume of 9,044,000 MMB EHCO by-pass115. Such an accounting may be the source of errors due to the fact that prices for EHCO sold on the market are different (substantially lower) than those for CCO116 and for oil blended with a diluent. For Hamaca, the total EHCO by-pass was 20,880,000 MMB117. On the other hand, EHCO by-passing the upgrader is covered by the expropriation of an asset or interest according to Article 2 of the 2007 Law, as it applies to blended oil.\n\nCf. Claimants' Tables submitted on 20 March 2017 for Petrozuata and Hamaca.\n\nQuestion 15, para. 36. However, the Petrozuata 2006 Business Plan simply mentions EHCO by-pass production (slide 2, LECG-082). The Hamaca 2006 Business Plan notes the use of EHCO for \"blending and sales\" independent of the upgrader during turnarounds (p. 20); it records prices for EHCO blend (p. 17) that are so low (compared to naphtha) that they rather support the assumption of simple EHCO production. When the Claimants quote their experts (*ibidem*, footnote 62), they refer to their reporting on \"EHCO\" and not \"blending\" (CLEX-086). Similarly, the Hamaca Board of Directors provided on 18 May 2006 for a 90 MBD by-pass production of EHCO during turnaround (C-344, Figuera Appendix 25, p. 3, 8), and, at its meeting of 12 September 2006, it assumed a production of 80 MBD EHCO during such an occasion (Figuera Appendix 75, p. 2). By-pass production during turnarounds and emergency shutdowns was also recognized at Petrozuata; cf. Financial Statements 2006/5, p. 14, noting that by-pass production consisted of EHCO not processed through the upgrader (LECG-009); and for 2004/3, p. 14/15, adding that by-pass produced oil was blended with Santa Barbara crude (LECG-094). The Respondent's Counsel mentioned an agreement of the Ministry with PDVSA \"to provide the Mesa necessary for the blending process\" during the 2006 turnaround at Hamaca; TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4568:4-9 (Preziosi).\n\nCEM, p. 53-55/pdf.\n\nCEM, p. 244/245/pdf.\n\nCEM, p. 63-65/pdf.\n\nCf. CEM, p. 245/246/pd, and CLEX-086, Hamaca, OPEX. Such costs are explained as projections for future sale of blended products on the Claimants' part (cf. Respondent's Cost Estimations for Hamaca, under Nos. 14 and 21). However, such production took never place and the Claimants' experts, while accounting for costs for naphtha, account in fact for the sale of by-pass EHCO that does not contain naphtha. In any event, the amount in US$ for the naphtha portions as mentioned do not comply with the quantities of EHCO by-passed if one would prefer understanding that such EHCO was used for the production of blended oil.\n\nCEM, p. 52/pdf; Claimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 34, notes that during upgrader maintenance periods, the Petrozuata Project sold blended products. See also CEM, p. 15, recording a total of 934.9, an amount reduced by the Claimants' experts to 913.5 for the purpose of excluding the first half of year 2007; Abdala/Spiller, Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2014, footnote 37.\n\nIn the valuation of the Claimants' experts, prices for EHCO sold are approximately 30% of the pricing of heavy syncrude; cf. CLEX-086, Revenues (Petrozuata and Hamaca).\n\nCf. CEM, p. 244/245/pdf.\n\n337.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that there is no evidence on the production of blended oil during turnarounds in the Claimants' case. In addition, the wells' activity could be turned down but never stopped completely; there were quantities of EHCO to be disposed of when no upgrading capacities were available due to an ongoing turnaround. Part of such volumes of EHCO could be stored on the upgrader's site and disposed of as soon as the turnaround was terminated. Another part, exceeding such storage capacities, was sold as EHCO. These volumes of \"EHCO by-pass\" are not accounted for by the Respondent's experts118, whereas they are included in the Claimant's experts' accounts together with prices in US$ that appear to represent amounts around 30% compared to the sales prices for heavy syncrude. They represent what the Claimants wrongly labeled as \"blended oil\".\n\nCf. Brailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, footnotes 129 and 152, where the reference to the sale of EHCO by-pass, respectively blended oil, during turnarounds by the Claimants' experts is noted.\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal has two ways to take account of this supplemental sale of EHCO that represents a loss when compared to the but-for scenario governed by the Association Agreements. One option would be to take account of the respective volumes of EHCO by-passed and sold during turnarounds separately, and to deduct the associated costs, royalties and taxes. The Tribunal does not adopt this method, because in the absence of reliable information on the latter items the result would be speculative119. The other option is based on the true function of the sale of EHCO bypass, which is to compensate part of the loss in production of upgraded CCO during turnarounds. As will be explained below in part F, such compensation is made in the form of values additional to the total input of EHCO to the upgrader and the outgoing CCO.\n\nFor instance, royalty would be fixed at 30% and not combined with the extraction tax to a total of 33 1/3%.\n\nc. The Reserves figures\n-----------------------\n\n339.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes the difference existing between the Reserves available for the Projects for their lifetime and the Reserves remaining in the fields after that until a later point in time when they will be completely exhausted after all available techniques for oil extraction have been used.\n\n340.\n\nNonetheless, the Tribunal notices a gap in the Respondent's reasoning. It is one thing to affirm that the full quantity of Reserves of the whole field will not be available for the Projects for the next 20 years, while it is a different matter to know the quantity of oil Reserves contained in the field that can be extracted by the Projects during their lifetime. In other words, while the Reserves of the field offer production of oil for a longer period than the term of the Projects, this does not state how much will be available for the Projects and how much will remain when they reach their term. In order to answer such question, one needs to assess either the Reserves available for the Projects or the difference between such Reserves and the Reserves of the field. The Respondent did not provide this information120.\n\nThe Respondent's valuation experts could have gathered such information when they visited the site, but they were instructed not to ask questions about the production of the reservoirs; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 12, p. 3613:39 (Flores).\n\n341.\n\nThe information provided by the Ministry Reserves figures implies the use of techniques that are more developed and more productive than the cold production operated by the Projects. EOR techniques are mentioned in this respect. However, even when assuming that the Ministry Reserves cover Reserves contained in the field that are not accessible to the Projects as long as they do not change their operational mode, such information does not determine the quantity of Reserves available for the Projects.\n\n342.\n\nWhat the Respondent calls Mr. Figuera's basic point, that the reserves available for the owner of the resources will always be higher than the Reserves for a particular project of a specific term, is of course correct. But it does not help to identify the quantity of Reserves available for the Projects. Mr. Figuera's formula would still be entirely correct if the Projects would leave one barrel of oil in the field when they leave the site. Further analysis is required.\n\n343.\n\nOne refinement of Mr. Figuera's basic point relates to the impact of costs. Contrary to the Projects' Reserves, that are accounted for only if recovery is certain or probable when using a technique that is known and proven, the Ministry's Reserves do not account for the impact of higher costs due to the use of new techniques and the difficulty to extract the field up to its point of exhaustion. There might come a point where the production based on the remaining Ministry's Reserves in the field becomes uneconomic, notably when compared to the costs of importing oil from abroad.\n\n344.\n\nThe Respondent conducts its demonstration by reference to the Hamaca recovery factors of OOIP that differ from 5.4% to 11.7%, depending whether one looks at the 35-year life of the Project or at the life of the field. Again, even if correct, this does not show that the recovery of 5.4% would not be sufficient for the operation of the Project in accordance with its projections121. These figures do not explain either whether, or if so how, the potential recovery of the Project could not be increased, in order to capture quantities above 5.4% but still below 11.7%122. The same document identifies the crude recoverable until 2150 as 3,715 MMB123, which is more than enough to allow the extraction of volumes envisaged by the Project. If the situation was as alarming as it is presented by the Respondent, one would expect to find at least a note in such a budget report. There is no such note.\n\nCf. Figuera Appendix 75, slide 15.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the General Business Plan attached as Exhibit B with the Hamaca Association Agreement (C-22, p. 518/pdf) forecasts \"a primary depletion recovery factor of 10.5%\", grounding this conclusion on an estimated OOIP of 33 billion barrels and the current drilling plan, based on the results of laboratory studies, review and extrapolation of Block B production history, and reservoir simulation\" (comment to figure 3).\n\nFiguera Appendix 75, slide 10.\n\n345.\n\nIt appears interesting to note that for the Huyapari field (that is part of Hamaca), the 2015 PDVSA Report records 4.5 billion Proved Reserves in 2015 (CLEX-090)124 and compares this volume to an actual production of 151 MBD, which is stated to be in a relation of 1:83 to the Reserves. The reports relating to the years 2008 to 2013 note amounts of Reserves between 4,136 and 5.34 billion, with production numbers between 125 and 165 MBD per year (CLEX-039). The Report filed by PDVSA with the Security and Exchange Commission on 17 November 2006 reported 3,808 billion Proved Reserves for the Hamaca's Huyapari field, noting that at a production rate of 106 MBD, this would allow production for 98 years (C-258, p. 27, 42/pdf). Similarly, the Petrozuata figures had moved from 2,522 billion at the end of 2004 (same Report, p. 42/pdf) to 2.4 billion in 2006 (C-404) and 3.9 billion in 2010 (C-623)125. The Descriptive Report of 1996 had stated that a reserve of 2.7 billion was sufficient to guarantee the 1.5 billion to be produced by the Project during 35 years126. Any other position would run counter to the Association Agreement (C21) where the parties accepted that 1,533 billion barrels could be currently planned as \"Total Oil Required\" (Art. I). It would seem far from reality to submit that the Project's reserves are pumped out in the near future.\n\nFigure confirmed by Witness Figuera, TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2439:13-18.\n\nWitness Figuera did not object to this assumption (TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2369:10-2374:14), having accepted earlier that the figure of 2,477 billion barrels was correct (TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 8, p. 2119:82120:10).\n\nJoint Venture Project (Maraven-Conoco) Petrozuata C.A. Descriptive Report, p. 130/pdf (C-92); Revision of Descriptive Report dated January 2000 (C-323, p. 59/pdf). Witness Lyons confirmed the numbers (TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 7, p. 1893:12-1894:10, 1932:20-22) and the figure of 2,434 retained in 2006 (TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 7, p. 2017:3-2019:9, 2020:16-2023:14).\n\n346.\n\nThe Parties have not provided evidence that allow the Tribunal to draw precise conclusions about the potential impact of EOR or techniques other than cold production. It has been stated that such techniques were uneconomic; it must be stressed that this was in 2003 or later, but before 2007. For instance, the Tribunal considers too short the Respondent's statement that the Petrozuata Board of Directors concluded at its meeting of 6 October 2005 that Enhanced Recovery (EOR) using steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) was uneconomic (C-333). In fact, as the Minutes explain, the Board wanted to submit the matter to the representatives of the shareholders. It was noted that the Ministry imposed a limit on Petrozuata of 120,000 BPD of EHCO per month; the Minutes then say:\n\nConsequences - if the limit continues for the life of the concession, there is no incentive to change the current cold production techniques until or after the year 2030. (p. 297)\n\nThe Respondent's Witness Mr. Figuera was involved in actively considering a shift to EOR techniques, as noted in the Minutes:\n\nRuben Figuera proposed that the Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Pilot Project be considered to be a technology investment and, as such, that it be carried out using resources reserved for the contributions required by the Science and Technology Law, which has been estimated for 2006 at approximately US$ 34 MM. The members of the Board of Directors believe that this is a possibility, if other technology investments or expenses are not identified which would add to the amount of the estimated contribution. The members of the Board of Directors agreed to discuss this point in the scheduled meeting of shareholders in order to reach an agreement. (p. 300)\n\nMr. Figuera explained that the Project recognized that there was the capability, through the use of steam injection technology, of extracting oil with higher viscosity from the thicker sands that had already been exploited, but that such technology would be difficult to implement given the Project's earlier decision to drill extensively multilateral wells127. Witness Lyons also confirmed that such techniques were available when they became necessary in order to fill up the upgrader128. A Petrozuata EOR Information Package of March 2005 contained a feasibility study promoting EOR as an option to utilize the excess gas production on site (C-332).\n\nFiguera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, para. 22; Supplemental Testimony, 26 January 2010, paras. 20, 27; Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 72.\n\nTR-E, March 2017 Hearing, Day 11, p. 3216:4-12.\n\n347.\n\nThe Respondent's rejection of any access to such techniques in later years and for the second part of the life of the Projects is not convincing in light of its submission of an expert opinion prepared by Dr. Rafael Sandrea concluding that steam injection \"was likely no longer uneconomic in 2004 and certainly was not uneconomic by 2006 and 2007, when oil prices rapidly increased\"129. This report stays in line with the deliberations of the Petrozuata Board of Directors in 2005130. The actual interest for such enhanced technology is also shown by the Respondent reporting about an \"EOR assessment\" at Hamaca in 2015 for which it claims reimbursement of costs of US$ 5.6 mil-lion131. The Tribunal understands that there was certainly a potential for introducing new and more efficient extraction techniques that would have enlarged the Projects' Reserves and increased their production132. Witness Figuera reported that all wells drilled since 2015 at Petrozuata have been fitted for ultimate steam-enhanced oil recovery in the future, a strategy consistent with the Ministry's directives to prepare for the use of EOR techniques to achieve a higher ultimate recovery factor of the fields133. PDVSA reported for the year 2009 that the project for steam injection (SAGD) \"was launched as the method for obtaining improved recovery of extra heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt area, in order to increase the oil reserve recovery factor up to 60%\"134. However, the Tribunal's record does not contain information and evidence sufficient to allow taking into account an extension of oil extraction in quantitative terms. Nonetheless, the availability of such techniques, supported by the Respondent's expert Sandrea from a time prior to the expropriation in 2006, make it possible to accept that the Projects had a potential of development that may have compensated in large part the alleged decline of the Projects' ability for EHCO recovery as argued by the Respondent in this proceeding.\n\nExpert Testimony of Dr. Rafael Sandrea, 29 January 2010, p. 25.\n\nIt was said that there were initiatives taken to introduce steam injection; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3188:4-3189:7 (Lyons), p. 3190:3-3191:7 (Figuera); TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2702:15-21 (Pati\u00f1o).\n\nHamaca Project Cost Assessment, p. 49.\n\nThe potential for the implementation of such future techniques had been recognized already in the General Business Plan attached as Exhibit B with the Hamaca Association Agreement (C-22, p. 518/pdf), noting that: \"Secondary recovery using water, gas, steam or other methods is not planned at this time, but may be determined to be viable, as more is learned about the reservoir characteristics in the Specified Area\" (comment to figure 3).\n\nCf. Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, para. 59; further Testimony, 20 July 2009, footnote 19; Supplemental Testimony, 26 January 2010, para. 27; Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, footnote 207; Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, para. 85.\n\nPDVSA Annual Report 2009, p. 716 (C-564).\n\nd. PDVSA's management\n---------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it plausible that a number higher than usual of employees left Venezuela in the aftermath of the migration to *empresas mixtas* and the expropriation of two important holders of association agreements in the Orinoco Belt. It notes, however, that it has not received detailed information of such a move, and literally nothing about its impact on the operation of the Projects.\n\n349.\n\nThe mere fact that PDVSA offered substantially lower salaries to the Venezuelan personnel does not demonstrate that the quality of their work was lower than the quality of the work performed by previous workers. It has been said that most experienced technical employees left the Projects when the expropriation occurred135. But what were the numbers and the concrete impact? No evidence has been provided. Similarly, the Claimants' suspicion that Chevron was no longer admitted to play a significant role in the operation and maintenance of the Projects, and the upgraders in particular is not supported by any evidence136. It is taken as a \"key-assumption\" of the Claimants' experts137. This is not the role of an expert. The Claimants could have provided witness testimony or could have expanded on the analysis of the agreements governing certain *empresas mixtas* where the foreign (minority) participants, like Chevron, had controlling functions as operators of important parts of the Projects138.\n\nLyons, Fourth Witness Statement, 16 May 2014, para. 22; TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 6, p. 1573:3-11 (King).\n\nWitness Figuera stated that after the migration, engineers from Chevron became responsible for upstream planning and monitoring at Hamaca (cf. Testimony, 20 July 2009, para. 47). Chevron secondees occupied key positions (TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3197:19-3199:4). Chevron was one of the most important partners in the country (TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3199:12-14).\n\nConsolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, paras. 8 (a, b), 46, 116, 214; TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 6, p. 1696:21/22; 2017 March Hearing, Day 12, p. 3420:4-6, 3421:10-14, 3422:18-3423:2, 3426:15-3427:8, 3428:93428:20, 3437:16-19 (Abdala).\n\nThe Contract for the conversion to the mixed company PetroPiar executed on 5 December 2007 (R-45) provided that the Technical and Operations Manager shall be nominated by Chevron Orinoco, and that the management structure shall be reviewed by the partners for the purpose of assuring that it responds to the objectives and purpose of the mixed company (Art. 4.2).\n\n350.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that in certain respects, difficulties with the personnel have been observed and may have had the effect of lowering the progress of work, in particular during turnarounds on the upgraders139. This could have been a factor impacting on time and costs. It would have to be taken into account, if properly argued and supported by evidence. This will be considered later as a potential impact on costs.\n\nThe most explicit source constitutes the report on the PetroPiar turnaround of 2012, noting \"deficient performance of contractors due to lack of experienced supervisors\", \"many decisions made without involving the planners\", \"lack of quality control and specialists by the contractor, to repair tanks\", \"insufficient personnel to cover the work shifts\", \"insufficient operational support personnel\"; Figuera Appendix 46, PetroPiar 2012 Final Report on the PRAC, August 2013, p.87.\n\nC. Production at Petrozuata - Upstream\n--------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nThe Petrozuata Project was initially provided with a designated field comprised of a \"Base Area\" of 231 km\u00b2 and a \"Reserve Area\" of 69 km\u00b2 consisting of two areas, one to the south of the Base Area and the second to the east. The Project was supposed to be developed from the Base Area, and the Reserve Area was to be utilized only if the Project partners agreed that it was necessary and access was granted by the Ministry.\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n352.\n\nThe Claimants' experts took the most conservative oil production profile as it was contained in the ConocoPhillips Composite Economic Model that had been updated in late 2006 (LECG-085). This yields a projected recovery at Petrozuata of 913.5 million barrels of EHCO over the period between July 2007 and 2036140.\n\nFigure reduced from 934.9 covering late 2006 to 2036.\n\n353.\n\nA wealth of contemporaneous evidence confirms the reasonableness of the Claimants' production profile, in particular: (a) the Proved Reserves figures, as certified in August 2006 by the consulting firm D&M at 1.02 billion barrels of oil as of 31 December 2005 (LECG-078) and as at 31 December 2006 for SEC reporting purposes at 936.4 million barrels (LECG-006, 108); (b) the Petrozuata Economic Model from late 2006, showing a balance of 1,192 billion barrels (LECG-077, p. 468/pdf); (c) the Petrozuata Business Plan of 2006, forecasting total production of 1,235 billion barrels of EHCO from 2006 to 2036 (LECG-082)141.\n\nThis plan had not been approved by the Board, but for reasons unrelated to the productions, namely the proposed use of the Reserve Area (C-333).\n\n354.\n\nThe Petrozuata Project would likely have achieved at least the level of production anticipated before the expropriation and used in the Claimants' damages model, which is conservative. Moreover, the Claimants would have promoted the use of EOR techniques, which would be expected to increase EHCO production by a factor of three times or more, and at a minimum would have enabled the Project to \"keep the upgrader full\" for the full contractual term (120,000 BPD).\n\n355.\n\nPDVSA endorsed the production profile relied upon by the Claimants at the time. In June 2007, both the Respondent and Mr. Figuera affirmed that the Petrozuata Project would produce at least as much EHCO as required over its contractual term. From January 2005 until late 2006, Mr. Figuera was the President of Petrozuata. He approved oil recovery projections even greater than those assumed by the Claimants' experts. (a) The Petrozuata 2005 Annual Report projected that this Project would produce more than 1.6 billion barrels of EHCO over its operating life (LECG-106, p. 1). (b) In November 2006, Mr. Figuera delivered a presentation confirming that the Project was projecting the recovery of volumes of oil over 1.56 billion barrels of EHCO (C-324). In 2006, the Ministry announced that Proved Reserves at the Petrozuata field were 2.4 billion barrels, a figure certified by Mr. Figuera (C-471). The Ministry proposed almost doubling production at Pet-rozuata in August 2006, only 10 months before the taking (C-231). The Proved Reserves figures for Petrozuata that Venezuela has adopted and published after the expropriation remove any doubt about the field's ability to meet the Claimants' production profile, because they have been going up, from approximately 2.4 billion barrels as at the end of 2006 to 3.9 billion barrels now. 2010 is the latest year for which such figures were published.\n\n356.\n\nVenezuela has chosen Mr. Pati\u00f1o's pessimistic forecast, arguing that after the taking, the Petrozuata field has turned out to be far less productive than anticipated, and is now largely tapped out. Venezuela's date-of-award valuation assumes that the total EHCO production at Petrozuata from June 2007 to 2036 will be 522 million barrels. This hypothesis has to be compared to another, relating to the Ministry's Proved Reserves. Here the figures increased from 2,434 billion barrels in 2006 to 3,923 billion barrels in 2010 (C-404, C-623), while in parallel the Respondent's projections for production decreased from 653 million (Mr. Figuera) to 522 (Mr. Pati\u00f1o).\n\n357.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o adopts a decline rate for all wells in the field of 22% (corresponding to a 20% decline of the production rate). He uses this rate to suggest that a great number of new wells will need to be drilled each year. Further, he forecasts initial production rates for the new wells that will be drilled in the future. And he concludes that insufficient viable targets exist to supply the upgrader past 2021. The Claimants' expert Dr. Strickland explains that the core of Mr. Pati\u00f1o's method -the use of simple decline curves - is inadequate, and the method itself fraught with mistakes.\n\n358.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o calculates his decline rate by analyzing well test data for a total of 124 wells at Petrozuata, and he derives the median rate of decline for those wells, which he then applies to all existing and future wells in the field. Dr. Strickland shows that Mr. Pati\u00f1o misapplies his own inadequate decline rate methodology. First, he uses well test data only providing for a brief \"snapshot\" of a well's life, and do not account for routine operational changes that allow the prolongation of the lives of wells and the increase the amount of oil that they produce. Mr. Pati\u00f1o should have used the fiscalized daily production. Second, Mr. Pati\u00f1o wrongly conflates different types of wells. Some wells exhibit \"exponential\" decline (meaning they decline at a constant rate over time), while others are \"hyperbolic\" (meaning that the rate of decline constantly decreases over time). While two wells decline at an initial rate of 20%, the decline of the hyperbolic well subsequently reduces, with the effect that this well produces more barrels of oil over its life time than the exponentially declining well. Mr. Pati\u00f1o acknowledges that about half of the 124 wells that he analyzed at Petrozuata exhibited hyperbolic decline. He nevertheless effectively did not make the distinction, thereby understating future production.\n\n359.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o seems to have recognized his error when providing a revised decline rate in his Consolidated Report (paras. 42-45). His new analysis shows that when hyperbolic wells are properly taken into account, the field decline rate would drop from 20% to 14%, leading to a higher ultimate recovery. To avoid this result, Mr. Pati\u00f1o reintroduced into his calculations wells that he had previously excluded, and he also calculated different decline rates for existing and new wells.\n\n360.\n\nDr. Strickland compared the production resulting from the decline rate determined for the 124 wells Mr. Pati\u00f1o had chosen with what those wells actually produced during that same past period according to PDVSA's data. As Dr. Strickland showed, Mr. Pati\u00f1o's analysis produces results that understate actual production during the historical period by a wide margin. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's analysis results in an understatement of expected production at Petrozuata by approximately 367 million barrels of oil. Venezuela further refers to various Petrozuata documents that allegedly show decline rates similar to those claimed by Mr. Pati\u00f1o. However, these documents generally comprise short-term assessments. They do not support Mr. Pati\u00f1o's decline rate analysis.\n\n361.\n\nFor the Claimants, a further flaw is Mr. Pati\u00f1o's conclusion that there were only 262 well targets remaining in the Petrozuata field as of 1 January 2009. Mr. Pati\u00f1o applies an unrealistic standard to determine what oil sand bodies count as targets. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's criteria are unreasonably restrictive. Had those criteria been applied in real life, a number of wells that the Petrozuata Project actually drilled would not have been drilled. Dr. Strickland shows that Mr. Pati\u00f1o missed at least 22 additional viable well targets, even when applying his criteria. This mistake reduces the forecasted production by approximately 18 million barrels.\n\n362.\n\nThe Claimants also object that Mr. Pati\u00f1o's production model exclusively assumes the drilling of single lateral, as opposed to multilateral wells. A single lateral well has only one horizontal bore, while multilateral wells have two or three horizontal bores at different depths. At the outset of the Petrozuata Project, the shareholders (including PDVSA) jointly decided to drill primarily multilateral wells. Multilateral wells proved themselves capable of producing significantly more oil at Petrozuata than single lateral wells. Once it took over operations at Petrozuata, PDVSA largely abandoned this strategy and reverted to drilling less productive (and also cheaper) single lateral wells. Prior to the taking, the Project projected drilling up to 250 multilateral wells from 2007 through 2036 (C-337, C-480). The Respondent claims that by November 2006, the Petrozuata Board of Directors lost confidence in the use of multilateral wells142. The documentary record is different. The Project continued to endorse the drilling of multilateral wells. In November 2006, Mr. Figuera gave a presentation favorable to such wells (C-324), followed by another presentation in February 2007 (C-374). Venezuela proceeds to argue that multilateral drilling is too risky. These criticisms are rebutted by the Claimants' witness, David Brown.\n\nCf. Respondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, 7 January 2015, para. 365; Figuera, Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 72.\n\n363.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that when the necessary corrections to Mr. Pati\u00f1o's forecasting model are made, as Dr. Strickland did, Mr. Pati\u00f1o's model yields a production profile consistent with the one used by the Claimants' experts. This confirms the adequacy of these experts' preexpropriation forecasts, whose achievability is confirmed by the Ministry's, PDVSA's and ConocoPhillips' pre-expropriation Proved Reserves figures. The Claimants' documentation notes forecasted volumes of 118,200143 and 118,000 BPD144.\n\nPetrozuata 2006 Business Plan, p. 8/9/pdf (LECG-082); CEM 2006, p. 79/80 (LECG-085); Tables presented on 20 March 2017.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on Quantum, para. 120; Abdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 50.\n\n*2. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Respondent uses the data available in the business plans prior to the expropriation to show that the Petrozuata field simply could not produce the volumes that had been anticipated using cold production techniques over the term of the Project. This can be seen from a review of the production profiles and well-drilling programs reflected in the annual business plans and related documents since the year of the commissioning of the upgrader in 2001. An overview shows that the expected amount of total production varied between 1.76 billion barrels (2001), 1.59 (2002), 1.6 (2003), 1.58 (2004), 1.56 (2005), and 1,502 (2006). Production was set to fall off in 2027 (2001), 2033 (2004), 2029 (2005), and 2031 (2006). The total number of single-lateral horizontal wells required were initially 571, and then 745 (2002), increasing to 777 (2004). The 2002 business plan noted that 241 wells had been drilled. It was then noted the drilling of 21 wells in 2004 (2005), and a total of 56 new wells in the years 2005 to 2009, a number that increased in two steps from 83 to 116-119 the year thereafter (2006). In August 2003, the Project partners recognized that access to the Reserve Area would be necessary and that the Project would require more acreage beyond that Area in order to achieve EHCO feed rates to the upgrader of 120,000 BPD for the life of the Project. The Respondent further notes that ConocoPhillips projected that the production level of about 118,200 would last only until 2023, not 2031145.\n\nConocoPhillips RCAT group, Building Production Capacity Reserves, October 2006 (C-474).\n\n365.\n\nThe Respondent further refers to a number of internal presentations of ConocoPhillips, noting a steep decline in production of multilateral wells between 2000 and 2007 and a further loss of 18% to be expected if no well-drilling program was conducted. A ConocoPhillips' summary is shown estimating a drop of ultimate recovery from 1,767 to 1,246 billion barrels. The steep downward trend for the period after year-end 2006 is further demonstrated by Project's documents estimating a decline rate of about 20% per annum, as shown by the weekly reports prepared by the reservoir personnel between 2004 and the first half of 2007, considering active wells, inactive wells and well repairs, the graph from a November 2006 presentation to the Petrozuata Board of Directors, reflecting an 18% annualized decline rate, a presentation to the Ministry in February 2007, and a June 2007 production capacity report reflecting a decline rate of 19.7%.\n\n366.\n\nOn this basis of information as per 26 June 2007, and relying in large parts on Mr. Figuera's evidence, the Respondent estimates that a total of 653.4 million barrels of EHCO would be produced at Petrozuata using cold production techniques through 12 April 2036, and that those EHCO volumes would yield a total of 562.1 million barrels of CCO.\n\n367.\n\nWhen looking forward into the period post-nationalization, decline rate becomes the key issue. It is at the core of Mr. Pati\u00f1o's study. He relied on the periodic production (or well) test data for individual wells. He selected those wells that had six years of production data that did not present erratic behavior. Based on those wells, 145 in total, he determined that the appropriate decline rate for the wells at Petrozuata is 22% on an exponential basis. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's analysis was aimed at deriving a decline rate that could be applied to all of the wells at the field over the entire term of the Petrozuata Project, not just the wells drilled in the best sands at the outset of the Project. Mr. Pati\u00f1o explains that the wells that remained to be drilled at Petrozuata as of 1 January 2009 would be \"in-fill\" wells (*i.e.* wells drilled between existing wells in locations where field energy has already been substantially depleted) or that would be geologically and petrophysically less desirable. Such wells would tend to decline at steeper rates and almost invariably exponentially and not hyperbolically as this had been claimed by Dr. Strickland.\n\n368.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o also determined that 262 new well targets remained to be drilled as of 1 January 2009. He assigned initial potential production rates to each of the new wells he identified. He estimated that the plateau period for the new wells at Petrozuata would last about six months for wells in the Base Area and 18 months for wells in the Reserve Area.\n\n369.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o reached the following conclusions regarding Petrozuata: (1) As of 1 January 2009, the Project had drilled, completed and connected 373 production wells, 289 of which were active and 29 had minor problems requiring routine repairs. The potential production from those 318 wells totaled 112.1 MBD. In addition, 12 wells with a potential production of 6.1 MBD were assumed to be completed and connected to production by the end of 2008. This would result in a production capacity of the field of approximately 118.2 MBD as of 1 January 2009. (2) Mr. Pati\u00f1o also assumed that during 2009, 29 new wells would be drilled and that 14 single-lateral wells would be drilled in replacing multilateral wells that failed. (3) Thereafter, Mr. Pati\u00f1o added new wells year after year based upon the number of wells included in the drilling program assumed by the Claimants' experts. He also assumed that (a) additional single-lateral wells would be drilled to replace multilateral wells that failed, (b) 10% of the single-lateral wells would fail and be \"redrilled\" and (c) wells would fail and be repaired at the annual rate of 16% of the active wells.\n\n370.\n\nFor the Respondent, Mr. Pati\u00f1o's study shows that the field runs out of well targets in 2020. Production would start to fall off prior to that time, and it falls off dramatically thereafter, as there are no new wells to drill to partially offset the decline. In total, in taking account of the number of wells drilled and all those completed, re-drilled or completely new, Mr. Pati\u00f1o's production capacity program assumes a total of 757 wells over the life of the Project. That figure is consistent with the number of wells that was assumed in the business plans prior to the expropriation.\n\n371.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o concluded that for the period between 1 January 2009 through the term of the Petrozuata Project, a total of approximately 461 million barrels of EHCO would be produced and that EHCO production from inception of the Petrozuata Project through 12 April 2036 would total 848.4 million barrels. That figure is about 400 million barrels less than the volumes that the Claimants contend would be produced based on the outdated ConocoPhillips model that was prepared in 2006. Based on the substantial additional drilling activities that have taken place in the years since the ConocoPhillips model was prepared, it has become apparent that the field will not support either the production profile assumed in the Claimants' model on an annual basis in light of the welldrilling program set forth therein or the accumulated production volumes the Claimants and their experts assume.\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal will not have to return to the figures tied to the Respondent's *ex ante* view of production as shown through its reading of the business plans for Petrozuata between 2002 and 2006. The minimal total production was estimated at 1,502 billion barrels in 2006. At that time, it was also admitted by all participants that a total of 745 (2002), respectively 777 (2004) wells were to be drilled, with a pace of about 10 to 24 new wells per year between 2005 and 2009, the total remaining still far below the expected total amount146. In light of the fact that the projected total of 777 wells has not been reached, the Respondent's submission that the Project lacked sufficient available targets is not convincing, and, in any event, not supported by evidence. Witness Lyons testified that at the end of 2006, 825 laterals remained to be drilled147. It also appears as common knowledge at that time that the lifetime of the Petrozuata Project will not end in 2036, but that a cliff will occur at the earliest in 2027. Although the Respondent claims that substantially lower production was observed before the expropriation, the figures presented do not support such a conclusion. None of the business plans between 2001 and 2006 showed daily production significantly lower than the maximum allowance of 120,000 BPD. The internal notes of ConocoPhillips on which the Respondent relies to show significant declines in production are not pertinent since the purpose of showing such declines was also to alert on the need for new wells. The weekly reports filed between 2004 and 2007 show many variations in the wells' productivity, and a decline in the years 2006 and 2007, but they do not provide any information on future drillings148. And how may it possibly be explained that the Ministry's proposed term sheet for migration, submitted in August 2006, suggested that Petrozuata will \"no longer be subject to the production limit of 120 MBD\", and that the Mixed Company \"is authorized to expand its capacity to 225 MBD, approximately\" (C-231, C-232, C-236)?\n\nCf. Figuera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, paras. 16-29; Pati\u00f1o, Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 20.\n\nLyons, Rebuttal [3rd] Witness Statement, 14 April 2010, para. 11; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3210:173211:11. Mr. Lyons referred to the list provided in the Petrozuata Long-Range Plan of April 2006 (C-480).\n\nCf. Figuera Appendix 102 (2004), 103 (2005), R-279 (2006), R-280 (January-June 2007).\n\n373.\n\nFor instance, the Respondent relies on a November 2006 presentation to the Petrozuata Board of Directors reflecting an 18% annualized decline rate, while it also adds that this applies \"if no wells were to be drilled in 2007\"149. The same decline is derived by the Respondent from a November 2007 presentation, however again subject to the proviso that such loss would occur \"if the 2007 well-drilling program were not implemented in a timely fashion\"150. As long as the total amount of wells that had been approved by all participants including the Respondent's company PDVSA had not been reached, there remains no convincing argument in support of a dramatic decrease or decline in production. Mr. Figuera exaggerates as well when pointing to a decrease of production capacity of the field to 108,000 BPD. The difference of 12,000 BPD up to the maximum is equal to the production of 15 wells at 800 BPD each, which corresponds approximately to the average number of wells drilled at that time per year. Moreover, a closer look to the document on which the Respondent151 and Mr. Figuera152 rely demonstrates that the purported decline in production was of a purely transitory nature in the year 2008, when the Claimants were no longer participants in the Project. Indeed, the report on the Production Capacity Petrozuata Oil Field of June 2007153 simply notes that the current capacity in 2008 was 108,000 BPD and that a decline of the oil field was observed. The document then refers to an optimized drilling program for the implementation of new wells (p. 5) and notes that the construction of new well pads and wells had been severely impacted as a result of contractual delays, new ministerial regulations and restrictions on cash flow caused by OPEC reductions (p. 7)154. The report concludes that the negative impact in 2008 will not occur in 2009 (p. 8). It presents a time line providing for the addition of two wells per month starting within six months (so end 2008). The report adds as from 2009 onwards new well production of 10,560 BPD per year within four years (p. 10). Therefore, the decline that occurred was scheduled to be offset by new wells and none of the difficulties that had impacted the situation in 2008 bare any relation with the Project's characteristics as they existed when the Association Agreements came to an end.\n\nRespondent's Final Brief on Quantum, paras. 100-104, 109.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 102/103.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 102.\n\nFiguera Appendix 3: Production Capacity, Petrozuata Field, June 2007.\n\nFiguera Appendix 3, referred to in Figuera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, para. 23.\n\nSee also the Petrozuata Preliminary Monthly Report of February 2007, p. 1 (LECG-156, p. 37/pdf), noting that in order to comply with the Ministry's restrictions, the monthly average EHCO production had to be reduced to 95MB per day. These restrictions were frequently a matter of debate. At the Board of Directors meeting of 7 June 2006, the limitations imposed above the 120 MBPD monthly average were mentioned as a handicap in view of raising the upgraders capacity to 145 MBPD or even 165 MBPD (C-347, p. 16/pdf). In the Minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors of 13 September 2006 it was recorded that Mr. Figuera \"stated that, since last year, Petrozuata has been proposing a modification in the production strategy in order to raise production capacity to the Maximum Demonstrated Capacity (MDR) of the Upgrader plant, instead of maintaining capacity at the 120 MBD authorized by the MENPET, and that the company requested a second drill which was not authorized at that time\" (C-335, p. 19/pdf). This statement confirms that the maximum design capacity was based on instructions from the Ministry but could be increased in fact, and that further drilling was envisaged and feasible but not authorized at that time. At the next meeting on 15 November 2006, the \"production cuts imposed by the MENPET\" were again a matter for concern (C-336, p. 14/pdf). The Tribunal's record contains correspondence implementing these reductions as from September 2006 into the year 2007 (C-365-368, 370-372, 476). The Claimants alleged that these limitations on production had not been compensated by Maraven as this had been accepted in the Agreement dated 10 November 1995 (C-369; Claimants' Reply, footnote 255).\n\n374.\n\nMost of the Respondent's arguments in this respect are not only related to the *ex ante* situation but are presented to demonstrate a long-term decline of the Petrozuata field after 2009 and for the rest of its lifetime. Such a submission must fail because it leaves out of any perspective the consideration of events and projections pertinent for that future period.\n\n375.\n\nThe Claimants projected to recover at Petrozuata 913.5 million barrels of EHCO over the period from June 2007 to 2036. The overwhelming figures projected before the expropriation show numbers clearly above 1 billion barrels of EHCO Reserves. The latest available document shows 3.9 billion barrels for 2010155. The Tribunal finds that there is no argument left that the Project would not allow recovery of the quantity of EHCO required to meet the expected recovery of 913.5 million barrels (less the volumes of blended oil). Moreover, if the Respondent is of the view that this latter amount cannot be reached over the lifetime of the Project and that therefore the 2010 figure of 3.9 billion was not correct, it was its task to provide the pertinent evidence to which it has easy access. The Respondent has been asked several times to provide the pertinent business plans or other documents allowing an insight into the actual operation on site. It has not been willing to do what it was invited to do. It had not argued that this was an impossible task.\n\nPeople's Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, Petr\u00f3leo y Otros Datos Estadisticos 2009-2010, p. 71.\n\n376.\n\nThe Claimants have not provided annual numbers in their briefs. They were then submitted in their tables on production filed on 20 March 2017 where it was explained that the annual numbers were copied by their experts from the COP-Composite-Economic-Model of 2006 (CEM) (LECG-085), but expressed through more precise numbers in a December 2006 Full Valuation (CLEX-86). The numbers provided in these two documents mostly coincide and support an average production rate of 118,200 BPD from the beginning of the post-expropriation period, with the exceptions of turnaround years and without counting blended oil reported as sold during turnarounds.\n\n377.\n\nWhile it appears plausible that wells exhibiting a \"hyperbolic\" decline produce a total of oil higher than wells showing \"exponential\" decline156, the Tribunal need not entertain the debate in this respect. First, the evidence presented does not allow the Tribunal to identify which well has to go into one or another category, nor would this - if it was possible - allow a reasonable extrapolation to the totality of the wells operating in the fields. Second, if this distinction was as important as this is argued, one should expect to find a respectable amount of traces in the Project's documentation submitted to the Tribunal. This is not the case. Therefore, the Tribunal must conclude that the Respondent did not find further support for this theory in the Project's archives or that it did not consider it relevant for the Tribunal anyhow.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o recognized that a shift from one approach to the other would cause a drop of his 22% decline rate to 17.3% for the wells already in production on 1 January 2009; cf. Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 42-44.\n\n378.\n\nIn any event, the purpose of such demonstration and of the Respondent's arguments was to provide evidence for the actual decline of performance of the wells at the Petrozuata Project. This does not, however, demonstrate in itself that such decline has the effect of a corresponding decline of EHCO production. A decline in the wells' performance calls for the need to repair those wells that can be saved for better performance and to replace those that are definitely lost. Moreover, even if this was done and production was still declining, the Project would have to drill new wells.\n\n379.\n\nWitness Lyons testified that wells' decline had a reason other than what results from a simple observation of wells' performance. He recalled that the Petrozuata Project had drilled predominantly multilateral wells that were much more productive than singular lateral wells. When the Claimants had left the Project, PDVSA decided to change strategy and to focus on drilling of singular lateral wells only. With these wells the ultimate recovery of oil was much lower (about 20 to 30 percent)157.\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 4, p. 1077:5-1078:17; Day 5, p. 1329:2-1332:13; Second Witness Statement, 30 October 2009, paras. 10, 11, 13, 24, 30; Fourth Witness Statement, 16 May 2014, para. 21; Fifth Witness Statement, 13 October 2014, paras. 43-48.\n\n380.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o does not go as far. His analysis is focused on observing a strong well's production, while he did not examine with any detail the potential for improvement in production through an increase in drilling new wells, re-drilling, replacing and repairing of wells. Without this other part of the overall view of net figures on production, the resulting conclusions are incomplete and cannot identify the recoverable EHCO quantities on the sites. When Mr. Pati\u00f1o was asked at the February 2017 Hearing whether he did check his work with the target wells in the post-expropriation models with the new companies, he told the Tribunal that he did not verify it158, adding that asking for them \"wasn't part of my job\"159. He further confirmed that the Projects ought or must have such lists160. On the other hand, no dynamic model of the reservoir did exist161. Witness Figuera mentioned the existence of a \"Strategic Plan\"162; however, such plan has never been presented to the Tribunal163.\n\nTR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2681/1-5.\n\nTR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2679/10-12.\n\nTR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2678/14-2679/8.\n\nTR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2752:9-2756:5 (Pati\u00f1o), p. 2842:21-2843:15, 2851:9-13 (Strickland). However, Mr. Pati\u00f1o also said that before the expropriation the Hamaca Project used a Dynamic Reservoir Model for its production (TR-E, February 2017 Hearing, Day 9, p. 2569:2-16). He told that after the expropriation, PetroPiar used a geological model with which they were able to establish additional drilling targets to maintain their production potential (*ibidem*, p. 2574:6-11). Mr. Pati\u00f1o also accepted that where an updated Dynamic Model did exist it was pointless to use simple decline curves to predict production (*ibidem*, p. 2569:2-11).\n\nTR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3126:18-3127:12.\n\nThe Respondent's experts did not ask that the plan be provided to them; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 12, p. 3595:13-3596:2 (Flores).\n\n381.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o did not comply with a fundamental equation contained in a document he had submitted to the Tribunal:\n\nNew development wells and/or recompletion of existing wells will occur in every year during the project in order to offset production decline164.\n\nThis formula provided in a document relating to Hamaca does of course equally apply to Petrozuata165. Mr. Pati\u00f1o did not determine the number of new wells required (staying instead with the maximum of 757 wells projected from the very beginning of the Petrozuata Project), and he retained the same number of new wells to be drilled in the years 2009 to 2020 as projected at the same time, without adding any new well as from 2021 for the remaining 15 years of the Project, although he must have been aware that the decline of wells he observed required necessarily more wells to be drilled and to be replaced than he had planned. In other words, Mr. Pati\u00f1o missed the goal of offsetting production decline166.\n\nPati\u00f1o, Appendix 7, Petrolera Ameriven S.A., Hamaca Project, Upstream Plan of Development: 190,000 BOPD, Orinoco Extra Heavy Oil Belt, Venezuela, Draft, December 3, 1999, p. 125, further noting that in relation to risks and projects' parameters, it was always required to ensure that the number of wells were such that it was possible to make 190'000 BPD (p. 246) and that there may be a cushion to enable the field to produce over 190 MBOPSD in the event of a shortfall (p. 247).\n\nMr. Figuera's Presentation on Petrozuata's Challenges of Exploitation in 2006 listed as one of the operational challenges: \"Maintaining production capacity to feed the Upgrader Plant at Maximum Proven Capacity (MDR).\" (C324).\n\nCf. Strickland, TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2855:12-2857:1.\n\n382.\n\nThe inconsistency of Mr. Pati\u00f1o's approach with the characteristics of the Project can also be shown when regarding the option taken at the very beginning of the Projects in respect of decline rate. Mr. Figuera testified that this rate was 20% for Petrozuata167. If this had been the starting rate for the Project's wells' decline, why did no one at the time consider closing the site soon after 2007 when Mr. Pati\u00f1o projected on the basis of the same or a similar rate an increasing shortfall of EHCO production beginning in 2009?168\n\nFiguera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, para. 29.\n\nCf. Pati\u00f1o Appendix 81, Output.\n\n383.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o's methodology shows that when considered on a larger scale of available data, including a more representative selection of wells and a realistic assumption of available targets, the conclusions to be drawn from his method are not capable of demonstrating a net decline of oil production to such an extent that the production projections prevailing at the time would not be reached. Such a demonstration would have to include both sides of the coin, the effective decline on one side, and the failure to provide for sufficient new, replaced and repaired wells on the other169. More important is Mr. Pati\u00f1o's reliance on quantities of EHCO that were required for the more limited actual production and sales of CCO since 2009, while he admitted that a greater quantity of EHCO was in fact available and would have allowed supporting production of upgraded syncrude to the extent required by the projections adopted by the participants in the Association Agreements. A selection of figures retained by Mr. Pati\u00f1o may illustrate his assessments:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Mr. Pati\u00f1o's data | Actual data |\n|  | Active Potential EHCO Production170 | EHCO Production to Upgrader171 | CCO for sale172 | EHCO required for blending173 | Total EHCO required for upgrading and blending (column 5 + 9) |\n|  | BPD174 | MMB | BPD | MMB175 | BPD | MMB | BPD | MMB | MMB |\n| 2009 | 120,723176 | 44,067,180 | 105,501 | 38,508,000 | 90,953 | 33,198,000 | 9,124 | 3,330,131 | 41,838,131 |\n| 2010 | 120,984 | 44,159,160 | 69,021 | 25,192,000 | 59,503 | 21,718,000 | 35,526 | 12,966,954 | 38,158,954 |\n| 2011 | 114,022 | 41,618,030 | 76,637 | 27,972,000 | 66,068 | 24,115,000 | 24,061 | 8,782,320 | 36,754,320 |\n| 2012 | 110,907 | 40,481,055 | 107,674 | 39,409,000 | 92,826 | 33,974,000 | 0 | 0 | 39,409,000 |\n| 2013 | 107,737 | 39,324,005 | 94,262 | 34,405,000 | 81,263 | 29,661,000 | 16,500 | 6,022,542 | 40,427,542 |\n| 2014 | 103,313 | 37,709,245 | 82,351 | 30,058,000 | 70,995 | 25,913,000 | 28,759 | 10,497,121 | 40,555,121 |\n| 2015 | 98,876 | 36,089,740 | 70,592 | 25,766,000 | 60,858 | 22,213,000 | 36,055 | 13,160,089 | 38,926,089 |\n| Subtotal | 776,562 | 283,448,41 5 | 606,038 | 221,310,00 0 | 522,46 6 | 190,792,00 0 | 150,025 | 54,759,157 | 276,069,157 |\n| Ave. / year | 110,937 | 40,492,631 | 86,577 | 31,615,714 | 74,638 | 27,256,000 | 21,432 | 7,822,680 | 39,438,451 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |\n\nCf.

Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 116; Pati\u00f1o, Appendix 81, Output. These numbers are recalculated from the volumes of CCO mentioned in Mr. Pati\u00f1o's Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 116 (with a yield factor of 0.8621); for 2009-2013, the numbers for BPD have been copied from Mr. Figuera's Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, table 4, para. 87, based on Appendix 81.\n\nThe numbers for 2009-2015 are all copied from the Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 116, where Mr. Pati\u00f1o explains that he took them from Mr. Figuera's Third Supplemental Testimony of 15 August 2014, table 4 (para. 87), where reference is made to Appendix 81. This is correct for the years 2009-2013. However, Mr. Pati\u00f1o did not observe that Mr. Figuera updated his documentation and submitted a new set of invoices in his Appendix 108, further noting the results in his Fourth Supplemental Testimony of 7 January 2015, table 2, para. 20, from where the numbers on EHCO production have been copied in the Respondent's Assessment of Production submitted on 2 June 2017.\n\nThese quantities represent 76.67% of blended oil sold as per the information submitted by the Respondent at the 2017 March Hearing, and also contained in the Petrozuata Assessment of Production, p. 1 (for the quantities of MMB).\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o also provides the figures for \"Year Start\", which are slightly different and less suitable for comparison purposes. Cf. Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 116; Pati\u00f1o, Appendix 81, Output.\n\nThe numbers have been rounded by Mr. Pati\u00f1o.\n\nThe number of BPD for 1 January 2009 is 118,189. This figure has not been verified by Mr. Pati\u00f1o, but has been derived from the production potential of 121,900 BPD as identified in Mr. Figuera's Testimony of 20 July 2009, para. 30. Mr. Pati\u00f1o then proceeded with some minor adjustments, resulting in the figure of 118,200 BPD; cf. Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 21; Expert Report, 18 August 2014, para. 141.\n\n384.\n\nFrom the year 2016, when he had no actual figures for CCO available, Mr. Pati\u00f1o selected the figures for Potential EHCO Production less 10% to determine EHCO Production to Upgrader and from there (x0.8621) CCO. Four years are here selected for the purpose of illustration. As a matter of fact, looking at his table, it is only as from 2019 that the results of his decline study are impacting seriously EHCO production at Petrozuata, with a further kick-down in 2024.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Active Potential EHCO Production | EHCO Production to Upgrader | CCO for sale |\n|  | BPD | MMB | BPD | MMB | BPD | MMB |\n| 2017 | 95,526 | 34,866,990 | 86,829 | 31,692,000 | 74,855 | 27,322,000 |\n| 2021 | 66,070 | 24,115,550 | 60,036 | 21,913,000 | 51,757 | 18,891,000 |\n| 2025 | 28,076 | 10,247,740 | 25,511 | 9,312,000 | 21,993 | 8,028,000 |\n| 2029 | 11,472 | 4,187,280 | 10,423 | 3,804,000 | 8,986 | 3,280,000 |\n| Total 2009 to 2036 |  |  |  | 460,950,000 |  | 397,385,000 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n\n385.\n\nSince the new operational mode of production was set up in 2009, EHCO supply served two different sales products, *i.e.* either upgraded oil or blended oil (DCO or Merey 16). For the years 2009 to 2015, Mr. Pati\u00f1o admits that more EHCO quantities were available (column 2/3) than the EHCO quantities supplied to the upgrader (cf. column 4/5). The extreme is shown for year 2010, where a production of EHCO of 120,984 BPD is reported, while the upgrader's availability was limited to 69,021 BPD, after it had been set at 105,501 BPD the year before.\n\n386.\n\nWhen taking account of both lines of production, it appears from the total (column 10) that starting with year 2013 the quantity of EHCO actually used (for CCO and blending) was higher than the volume that Mr. Pati\u00f1o accepted as available for potential EHCO production (column 2/3). From year 2016, the Tribunal has no evidence on the record for the amounts of blended oil produced and sold. When taking the average amount of about 21,000 BPD EHCO used for blending (column 8/9) per year as a guideline, it appears that from 2017 until 2036 this number is clearly above (in many years for an amount around 10,000 BPD) the difference between the quantities Mr. Pati\u00f1o identifies as \"total potential ECHO production\" and \"EHCO production to upgrader\"177. This means that the actual and projected production numbers are higher than what Mr. Pati\u00f1o determined as the maximum EHCO production at Petrozuata.\n\nSee Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 116; Pati\u00f1o, Appendix 81, Output.\n\n387.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o's volumes for total potential EHCO available on the sites (column 2/3) are always higher than the actual volumes extracted by the wells (column 4/5) for the purpose of producing upgraded CCO (column 6/7). This applies for two periods, the one between 2009 and 2015, and the other covering the years 2017 to 2036. Therefore, more EHCO was in fact available than what results from Mr. Pati\u00f1o's conclusions.\n\n388.\n\nThe foregoing is also confirmed when considering the estimated quantities of EHCO used for blending. When added to the volumes used for upgrading, the resulting amounts (column 10) are telling from two perspectives: (1) the added amount is always higher than the EHCO supplied for upgrading - thus showing that the EHCO taken into the upgrader is below the EHCO available; and (2) more importantly, this amount comes close to the actual feeding capacity of the upgrader as mentioned by the Claimants (118,000 BPD). The difference is about 10,000 BPD, which is hardly more than 12 new wells producing at a pace of 800 BPD.\n\n389.\n\nFor his definition of the available wells, Mr. Pati\u00f1o adopts a personal approach when he identifies characteristics of wells and their potential decline, but he does not proceed in the same way when it comes to determining the available potential for new wells and new targets. Dr. Strickland has rightly observed that a comparison to the quantities of certified Proved Reserves would have provided a serious picture about the possibility for extending drilling of wells178. It is indeed beyond commercial efficiency to accept Mr. Pati\u00f1o's view that in about a few years (2020), and fifteen years before the end of the Project, no new well will be drilled, and that the EHCO provided to the upgrader will be about 50% below its design capacity179.\n\nCf. Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 39-44.\n\nCf. *ibidem*, para. 116.\n\n390.\n\nWith a closer look at the key points of new wells to be drilled, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Pati\u00f1o projected 372 additional wells from 1 January 2009 (composed of 262 new wells, 68 replaced wells and 42 re-drills), a number that differs by one single well from the 373 wells added to the Project as per Mr. Figuera's testimony180 five years earlier. Furthermore, on the same table, Mr. Pati\u00f1o adopted exactly the same numbers of new wells to be added, year by year from 2009 to 2019181. For year 2020, Mr. Pati\u00f1o noted 31 new wells, while Mr. Figuera had 32. For Witness Lyons, wells were still to be drilled in year 2024182.\n\nFiguera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, para. 29.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 30.\n\nTR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2205:2-4.\n\n391.\n\nMore remarkably, Mr. Pati\u00f1o does not provide for any new well as from year 2021, although the Respondent's Witness Mr. Figuera stated that the Project's planning included 37, 48 and 25 new wells to be added in the period between 2021 and 2023. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's assumption is equally surprising in comparison to the Petrozuata Economic Model for late 2006 that forecasted drilling between 18 and 31 wells per year from 2022 to 2028, and then 41 in 2029 and 19 in 2030, ending with 3 in each year 2031 and 2032183. Mr. Pati\u00f1o opposed Dr. Strickland's assessment that 22 additional targets were available, stating that this would not have a significant impact184. Dr. Strickland's opinion185 would have deserved more attention, all the more since he asserted a corresponding increase of 18 million barrels for the lifetime of the Project, which results in approximately half a million barrels per year. In any event, the maximum numbers of projected wells in the future serve the purpose of planning work and budget; they do not set limits in such a way that no more wells above such figures could be drilled in the future in order to keep the upgrader full, if the economics allow186.\n\nLECG-077, p. 469/pdf.\n\nCf. Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 111, 115, Appendix 85.\n\nCf. *ibidem*, paras 108-110. Also TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2768:8-2771:1.\n\nCf. Witness Lyons, TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3204:2-3207:7.\n\n392.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Pati\u00f1o stays very close to the original assessment of production and drilling activities, using numbers that are close of being identical to those presented through the testimony of Mr. Figuera. As he explained to the Tribunal, he was instructed to use the volumes of CCO for sale up to 2015 and to calculate the amount of EHCO required on this basis187; therefore, he identified the EHCO production needed on the basis of the historical CCO that had been sold year after year188. Such an approach does not include considering whether the upgrader would not be able to produce more CCO as this had been done before 2009. The Tribunal finds that Mr. Pati\u00f1o's assessment of the decline rate of the wells does not include sufficient consideration of the potential of compensation through new wells and increasing work on maintenance and repair (and the associated increase in costs). This item is only marginally addressed in Mr. Pati\u00f1o's decline analysis189.\n\nTR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2666:9-15.\n\nTR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2744:4-7.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 106/107.\n\n393.\n\nThis gap in Mr. Pati\u00f1o's analysis also appears when a comparison is made with the estimations that Mr. Figuera had presented in his first testimony, where the starting production capacity of the Petrozuata Project was set at 121.9 MMB190, a figure on which Mr. Pati\u00f1o also relies as a bottom reference to his own projections191. Mr. Figuera used a declination rate of 20%, while Mr. Pati\u00f1o used the same or a similar rate (with some variations that are not pertinent for the comparison as it follows). However, their figures for EHCO production to the upgrader retained at the year-end are markedly different:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BPD | EHCO Production to upgrader (Mr. Figuera) | Active EHCO Potential Production (Mr. Pati\u00f1o) | EHCO Production Mr. Figuera v.

The main explanation must be Mr. Pati\u00f1o's assessment of EHCO production on the fields, which includes his method of determining declining wells and a restrained consideration for the drilling of new wells.\n\nThe Respondent192 and its valuation experts193 adopt the approach and the results of Mr. Pati\u00f1o's method and report, and they include in their presentation the figures relating to the historical period between 26 June 2007 and the end of 2008. Their conclusions are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | EHCO Production to Upgrader | CCO for sale |\n|  | BPD | MMB | BPD | MMB |\n| Mr. Figuera194 |  |  |  |  |\n| End 2007 | 106,132 | 19,531,383 | 84,505 | 15,568,593 |\n| 2008 | 113,111 | 41,398,549 | 97,543 | 35,700,904 |\n| subtotal | 111,288 | 60,929,932 | 93,643 | 51,269,497 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Mr. Pati\u00f1o |  |  |  |  |\n| 2009-2036 |  | 460,950,000195 |  | 397,385,000196 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Total |  | 521,879,932 |  | 448,654,497 |\n\nRespondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 325. The numbers for 2007 and 2008 are contained in the *ex ante* table, para. 113.\n\nCf. Brailowsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 246-249. The numbers for 2007 and 2008 are contained in the *ex ante* table, para. 74.\n\nTestimony, 20 July 2009, paras. 11/12. The amounts quoted by the Respondent and its experts are slightly different for 2007.\n\nThis number became 474,753,000 in Mr. Pati\u00f1o's last update under Appendix 90. However, he stated that the difference was negligible and he did not use it in his Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, cf. paras. 44, 116, nor did he use the figures composing this final amount. The Respondent and its valuation experts have also not adapted their figures to this last version.\n\nAs this has been noted above in respect of Mr. Pati\u00f1o's numbers on CCO sold between 2009 and 2015 (column 6/7) they were copied from Mr. Figuera's Third Supplemental Statement, 15 August 2014, para. 87, table 4 and the attached Appendix 81, not noting that Mr. Figuera had updated his information in his Fourth Supplemental Testimony and the attached Appendix 108. The Respondent and its valuation experts have relied on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's numbers, with the effect that their numbers are equally incorrect, and, as a consequence, any subsequent calculation based on them.\n\n395.\n\nTo conclude, the Respondent's presentation, resting on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's analysis exclusively focused on decline rates, cannot be retained by the Tribunal. There has been brought no evidence before the Tribunal that the production at Petrozuata may be limited to quantities significantly lower than the upgrader's design capacity of 120,000 BPD, which corresponds to 43,800,000 MMB. For the period between 2009 and 2015, the figures provided by Mr. Figuera, combined with the EHCO required for the sale of blended oil, confirm this assessment:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009 2015 | EHCO Produced | CCO Produced197 | EHCO required for CCO invoiced | CCO Invoiced | Blended Oil Sold198 | EHCO required for blending | Total EHCO used for upgrading and blending (column 4 and 7) |\n| 2009 | 38,745,784 | 31,173,844 | 38,507,947 | 33,197,701 | 4,343,460 | 3,330,131 | 41,838,078 |\n| 2010 | 34,221,901 | 19,511,360 | 25,192,499 | 21,718,453 | 16,912,683 | 12,966,954 | 38,159,453 |\n| 2011 | 32,092,161 | 23,205,820 | 27,972,368 | 24,114,978 | 11,454,702 | 8,782,320 | 36,754,688 |\n| 2012 | 37,809,627 | 32,692,940 | 39,408,584 | 33,974,140 | 0 | 0 | 39,408,584 |\n| 2013 | 40,884,534 | 28,447,930 | 34,405,492 | 29,660,975 | 7,855,148 | 6,022,542 | 40,428,034 |\n| 2014 | 40,253,749 | 26,300,630 | 30,058,054 | 25,913,252 | 13,691,302 | 10,497,121 | 40,555,175 |\n| 2015 | 38,760,178 | 23,498,940 | 25,766,208 | 22,213,048 | 17,164,587 | 13,160,089 | 38,926,297 |\n| total | 262,767,934 | 184,831,464 | 221,311,152 | 190,792,547 | 71,421,882 | 54,759,157 | 276,070,309 |\n| p/year | 37,538,276 | 26,404,495 | 31,615,879 | 27,256,078 | 10,203,126 | 7,822,737 | 39,438,616 |\n| p/day, BPD | 102,845 | 72,341 | 86,619 | 74,674 | 27,954 | 21,432 | 108,051 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n\nThis data shows that the amount of EHCO required to produce the EHCO needed for the upgrading and the sale of blended oil (in a proportion of 76,67%) are close to the maximum of 43,800,000 MMB design capacity for EHCO supply to the upgrader. The key figure to be considered by the Tribunal is 43,070,000 MMB, which corresponds to the 118,000 BPD the Claimants affirm as the feeding capacity of the Petrozuata field.\n\nPetrozuata Assessment of Production, p. 1; Figuera, App. 109. The EHCO required for the production of the quantities of CCO mentioned in the table represents numbers lower than those mentioned above under EHCO Produced (column 2). As explained by Mr. Figuera, the Project produced more EHCO than the quantities of EHCO required for the CCO that was produced, according to his figures. The required EHCO quantities are provided in Mr. Figuera's Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, and they can be calculated by dividing the figures of CCO Produced by the yield factor of 0.8621 (*e.g.* 26,404,495 CCO p/year: 0.8621 = 30,628,112 EHCO).\n\nSubmitted by the Respondent at the March 2017 Hearing; Petrozuata Assessment of Production, p. 1, referring to Figuera Appendices 110, 112. Blended oil is composed of 76.67% EHCO and 23.33% diluent (Naphtha or Mesa).\n\n396.\n\nAt this juncture, the figures to be retained are those relating to the EHCO Production Capacity. As mentioned above, the EHCO Production required for CCO Production is noted for informational purposes, because these quantities reflect the operational choices made as from 2009, with the effect that the CCO production was significantly reduced compared to the situation prior to that change, albeit complemented by the sale of blended oil199.\n\nThe operational choice mentioned above is accepted by the Respondent also in its impact on costs. As stated in the Respondent's Cost Estimation for Petrozuata filed with the Tribunal on 2 June 2017, in the \"but-for\" scenario, EHCO production would have been lower than it was in actuality, since only the EHCO that could be upgraded would have been produced. Therefore, the Respondent has deferred costs relating to drilling new wells so that the production capacity would be commensurate with the capacity required for EHCO production needed for actual CCO sales (p. 14). In other words, more new wells were actually drilled for the purpose of extracting sufficient EHCO to meet the need for upgrading to CCO and providing the 76.67% portion of the blended oil. This also means that more volumes of EHCO have been and still were available when further drilling new wells, more than what has been affirmed by Mr. Pati\u00f1o in this proceeding.\n\n397.\n\nTo obtain the approximate volumes of EHCO that would have been available when no blending was permitted, the amount of EHCO required for the production of the relevant corresponding CCO sold (taking account of the yield factor) has to be added to the EHCO portion of 76.67% in the blended oil200. As shown in the table above, the amounts thus reached (column 8) are comparable to those reported as overall \"EHCO Produced\" by Mr. Figuera (column 2). Approximate amounts of 39,500,000 MMB and 108,000 BPD can thus be retained as actual EHCO production figures experienced per year between 2009 and 2015201.\n\nThe resulting figures are comparable to the numbers shown by Mr. Figuera as \"EHCO Produced\". However, they are far below the EHCO Production Capacity reported by Mr. Pati\u00f1o.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent also argued that based on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's program the quantity of EHCO used for blending as from 1 January 2009 \"is assumed to remain in the ground until needed for CCO production\" and that therefore \"the larger number of wells actually drilled in the historical period is reduced (thereby reducing historical costs), since the excess EHCO production would not have been necessary\" (Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 317 *in fine*). The whole theory on EHCO stored underground for the purpose of later CCO production has no real basis, but if it would be admitted, as suggested by the Respondent, there would be more wells available than actually drilled, thus offsetting any decline even without drilling new wells. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's conclusions would then be irrelevant even for the Respondent.\n\n398.\n\nThese amounts become a little higher when also including the results of the EHCO production following the 18 months since the expropriation up to the end of 2008, when a total of 60,929,932 MMB has been produced, corresponding to an average of 111,288 BPD. In appropriate proportions, this allows the conclusion that in the period since the expropriation until the end of 2015, an actual average amount of 40,000,000 MMB per year has been produced, corresponding to 110,000 BPD.\n\n399.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o's assumptions on decline rates for the years starting in 2016 cannot serve as projection for the Tribunal's assessment of the most probable development of the Project had the expropriation not taken place. The Tribunal has no evidence on the record addressing the specific question of the available volumes for EHCO production from the fields for the period running up to the end of the Project's lifetime. The Reserves figures do not, as stated, impact negatively the prospects for sufficient production corresponding to the volumes projected on the basis of the Association Agreements. The actual EHCO production for the years 2009 to 2015 of 39,500,000 MMB and the numbers above this figure representing sales made before 2009 when the CCO production was combined with the sale of blended oil, indicate targets, however subject to improvements through increases in drilling and maintenance efforts that the evidence on the Tribunal's record has not shown to be out of reach.\n\n400.\n\nThe EHCO production of 118,000 BPD alleged by the Claimants202 corresponds to 43,070,000 MMB. These volumes are slightly above the actual figures for the period between 2009 and 2015 (39,500,000 MMB) and the actual average amount of 40,000,000 MMB for post-expropriation time in the years 2007 to 2015. The Tribunal finds no evidence and no convincing argument that would prevent it from retaining these figures for EHCO production at Petrozuata if the Association Agreements and the operation having the Claimants as partners had remained in place. These are standard figures based on the production capacity of the fields. They will have to be reviewed in light of the production capacity of the upgrader.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on Quantum, para. 120; Abdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 50.\n\nD. Production at Hamaca - Upstream\n----------------------------------\n\n401.\n\nThe Hamaca Project was planned for a designated production field from which to produce EHCO. The field was comprised of a main area (called \"H\" for Huyapari Block), and a reserve area to the south (known as \"M\" for Maquiritare Block), which was relinquished prior to the nationalization. The major constraint at Hamaca - and the main source of difference between the Parties - is the ability of the upgrader to process EHCO in the production of CCO. This issue will be examined further below (E).\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n402.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the production profile used by their experts for Hamaca Projects results in the recovery of approximately 1,864 billion barrels of EHCO from June 2007 to 2037, which corresponds to an average EHCO production level of approximately 175,000 BPD. That profile is taken from the Hamaca's Project's own Economic Model (prepared by Petrolera Ameriven), as last updated in October 2006 (LECG-129).\n\n403.\n\nThis oil production profile is consistent with other data showing expected production from the Hamaca field. (1) In February 2007, a ConocoPhillips team calculated Reserves for 1.96 billion barrels (LECG-111, p. 9/pdf). Recently, PDVSA reported the Proved Reserves to be 4.6 billion barrels (CLEX-090, p. 39). (2) The 2005 Hamaca Business Plan contains future oil production projections that are consistent with the figures used by the Claimants' experts (LECG-122/112). (3) ConocoPhillips Economic Model, in its last version produced in late 2006, projected the recovery of 1,894 billion barrels of EHCO over the life of the Project (LECG-085), an amount later adjusted to 1,864 billion barrels203.\n\nClaimants' 2017 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35.\n\n404.\n\nThe Claimants recall that in the first phase of this case, Venezuela relied on a production forecast for Hamaca that estimated the recovery of 1,672 billion barrels of EHCO from the date of the expropriation through the end of the Project's term204. This forecast rested largely on the same EHCO profile used by the Claimants' experts, but with a reduction to the Hamaca upgrader's OSF. In the later quantum phase, Venezuela used a more pessimistic forecast that foresees the recovery of only 1,051 billion barrels of EHCO from June 2007 until the end of the Project205. This forecast is premised on an even more desultory OSF for the Hamaca upgrader now predicted by Mr. Figuera.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 83.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 259.\n\n405.\n\nVenezuela's future EHCO production forecast in the quantum phase is again derived from Mr. Pati\u00f1o's theoretical model. Mr. Pati\u00f1o introduced into his model Mr. Figuera's assertion that the Hamaca upgrader will achieve an OSF of only 72.85% for the remainder of the Project's term. As a result, Mr. Pati\u00f1o artificially constrains EHCO production, so that the model can never yield a production figure of more than 143,432 BPD of EHCO206. The limit Mr. Pati\u00f1o introduced into his model prevents the upgrader from ever operating beyond Mr. Figuera's OSF forecast. Thus, the production figures under his model will always be wrong. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's EHCO production volumes for the historical period (2009-2015) substantially deviate not only from the Claimants' but-for scenario, but also from the actual post-expropriation production. Again, Mr. Pati\u00f1o ignores what has actually happened at the Project. This can be demonstrated by comparing Mr. Pati\u00f1o's ceiling on syncrude production with the actual syncrude production reported in past years, according to PDVSA. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's approach stands in stark contrast to the Claimants' experts' reliance on the Project's agreed business plans, as confirmed by both the Project's pre- and post-expropriation Proved Reserves figures. Further, Mr. Pati\u00f1o's production profile for Hamaca suffers from the same fatal flaws as his Petrozuata analysis, to the exception of multilateral wells that have not been used extensively at Hamaca.\n\nPati\u00f1o, Appendix 84, Field Metrics.\n\n406.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o's forecast of expected production is again based on a field decline rate. Dr. Strickland submits that the wrong data were used and that again wells that have an exponential (constant) and hyperbolic (ever-decreasing) rates are conflated. Mr. Pati\u00f1o uses a total of only 55 wells. He derives a single exponential decline rate of 24% per year, which he then mechanically applies to all of the more than 800 existing and future wells in the field for the period between 2009 and 2037. Mr. Pati\u00f1o has partially conceded his error and provided a new analysis in his Consolidated Report, adopting a hybrid approach resulting in an inflated decline rate of 18.7%207. Mr. Strickland demonstrates that Mr. Pati\u00f1o's decline rate is contradicted by the Project's actual production history. Mr. Pati\u00f1o understates expected production at Hamaca by approximately 695 million barrels over its remaining term. Once again, Mr. Pati\u00f1o attempts to justify his flawed analysis by referring to a few Project documents, which, however, do not reflect long-term production projections for the field.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 136/137.\n\n407.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o also reduces artificially production by adopting unrealistically restrictive criteria for well targets. Mr. Pati\u00f1o misses viable well targets, thereby depriving the Project of millions more barrels of production. As Mr. Pati\u00f1o conceded, the post-expropriation Project has actually drilled wells that he failed to include in his production forecast. Dr. Strickland explained that Mr. Pati\u00f1o's errors collectively serve to understate production at Hamaca by more than 706 million barrels of EHCO. When those errors were corrected, his model yields production volumes consistent with those used by the Claimants' experts.\n\n408.\n\nTo conclude, on upstream issues, the Claimants submit that (a) their experts rely on the most conservative of the Project's pre-expropriation forecasts, whose achievability is confirmed by the Ministry's, PDVSA's and ConocoPhillips' pre-expropriation Proved Reserves figures; (b) Venezuela's arguments that the productivity of the fields is declining are contradicted by these Proved Reserves figures, which have been going up since the expropriation; and (c) Mr. Pati\u00f1o's uses an inadequate methodology. When the various errors are corrected, his model produces results for future oil production at Hamaca that are consistent with the Claimants' case.\n\n*2. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nThe Respondent notes that there were some signs at Hamaca leaving doubts about the ability of the field to meet the EHCO requirements at the upgrader during the entire term of the Project. The total number of wells required at the field increased in the business plans from 739 in 2004 to 1047 in 2005 and to 1389 in 2006; and 635 wells were anticipated through 2015, as per the 2006 business plan, as compared with 527 wells for the same period in the 2005 business plan. The 2006 business plan made clear that the Project would run out of well targets in 2031 and that starting then, production would fall off (LECG-122/112).\n\n410.\n\nThe wells at the Hamaca Project suffered from a high decline rate. When Mr. Figuera took office as President of Petrolera Ameriven in June 2006, he was informed by Mr. Steinar Vaage, a ConocoPhillips secondee and General Manager of the Project that the Project was running with a 2% decline per month, corresponding to a 50 to 60,000 BPD decline of production capacity per year208. In sum, on an *ex ante* basis as of 26 June 2007, the Respondent estimates that a total of 1,671 billion barrels of EHCO209 would have been produced using cold production techniques and those EHCO volumes would have been processed to yield 1,576 billion barrels of CCO.\n\nFiguera Appendix 74.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 83.\n\n411.\n\nIn the *ex ante* valuation at Hamaca, the Respondent assumed that EHCO production would be constrained by the performance at the upgrader, which RAM IV said could be expected to operate at an OSF of approximately 84%. The Respondent relied on Mr. Figuera in explaining that \"despite the growing concerns regarding the production field, there was every expectation that the field could produce sufficient EHCO to feed the upgrader at the reduced OSF expectations reflected in the RAM reports\"210. The Respondent and its experts also assumed that even so the field was showing signs of having reduced capabilities under cold production. In the *ex post* valuation, the actual performance of the upgrader and the more severe limitations at the field must be taken into account.\n\nCf. Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 120.\n\n412.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondent relies on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's study. The expert's conclusions regarding the Huyapari field are as follows: (1) As of 1 January 2009, the Hamaca Project had drilled, completed and connected 325 wells, of which 266 were active and 43 were inactive and required minor repairs, while the other 16 wells were not reparable. The potential production from those 309 wells totaled 169.4 MBD. In addition, there were 32 wells drilled in 2008 but not yet connected to production in early 2009. When they are added, the production capacity program would total 201.2 MBD. (2) Assuming that these 201.2 MBD would have dropped by the end of 2009 to 177.7 MBD in light of the EHCO volumes that were required for the CCO sales achieved during the year, no new wells would have been needed. (3) Thereafter, Mr. Pati\u00f1o added new wells to assure that the overall production capacity of the field would be around 110% of the EHCO required for (a) CCO sales that were actually achieved in the historical period and (b) CCO sales that would be achieved in the projection period assuming a long-term OSF of 72.85%. After 2024, there were no new well targets, and from then on, production capacity will be insufficient to support the EHCO requirements for CCO production even at an OSF of 72.85%.\n\n413.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o's production capacity program at Hamaca assumes an aggregate of 1,218 wells. This is 171 wells more than the number set forth in the 2005 Business Plan, and 171-197 wells fewer than the number set forth in the draft 2006 business plan (1,389) or in the model on which the Claimants rely (1,415). Mr. Pati\u00f1o has concluded that over the whole duration of the Project, a total of 1,269 billion barrels of EHCO would be produced using cold production techniques, about 800 million barrels less than the production volumes the Claimants contend will be produced.\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\n414.\n\nThe Tribunal will address here the production of EHCO independently from the disputed availability of the Hamaca upgrader to treat the required quantities of EHCO. If it was demonstrated that the upgrader cannot deal with EHCO above a certain quantity, this will have to be added to the analysis. At this juncture, the question is focused on the amount of EHCO potentially capable of being extracted from the grounds and sent to the upgrader. The Tribunal notes that apart from repeating Mr. Pati\u00f1o's and Mr. Figuera's assertions, the Respondent has little to add for its position voicing doubts about Hamaca's field performance. Witness Figuera has nothing to report in this respect except the need to study enhanced oil recovery (\"EOR\")211. Reductions in production ordered by the Ministry in November and December 2006 are not mentioned212. As it does in respect of Petrozuata, the Respondent omits to consider the potential of new wells to be added to the site. For instance, when reporting about the message send by Mr. Vaage on 23 October 2006, alerting a 2% decline rate per month, the Respondent213 omits to add that this information meant \"without well additions\", as this was stated in the message send on 20 October 2006 by Mr. Steven Haile to Mr. Vaage, who then reported to Mr. Figuera214. This information has to be considered together with the Hamaca Board of Director's decision of 18 May 2006 to restart drilling in January 2007215. As explained by Mr. Figuera, field decline had as a consequence an increase in the numbers of wells to be drilled216. Conversely, if one does not drill wells, a drop-off in production of all wells will follow217. Witness Lyons explained that everybody understood that the overarching assumption for both Petrozuata and Hamaca was to keep the upgrader full218. Witness Figuera agreed with this requirement219; it was the key-assumption220. Mr. Pati\u00f1o failed to include this important objective into his methodology.\n\nFourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, para. 9.\n\nThey were a matter for concern at the Meeting of the Board of Directors of 16 November 2006 (C-343, p. 2).\n\nRespondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 119.\n\nFiguera Appendix 74.\n\nC-344, Figuera Appendix 25, p. 5. The Board further noted a current output rate of 185,000 BPD EHCO which is close to the design maximum.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2535:1-2536:15.\n\nWitness Lyons, TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 7, p. 1986:19-22.\n\nTR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3114:5-7.\n\nTR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3115:15-18.\n\nTR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3123:15/16.\n\n415.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot follow Mr. Pati\u00f1o's reliance on Mr. Figuera's allegation of a very low OSF factor (72.85%) of the upgrader with the effect that a reduced quantity of EHCO only can be fed into the upgrader and extracted from the fields221. Mr. Pati\u00f1o did not examine from any perspective the actual recovery factor applicable to the Hamaca upgrader.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 121/122, noting that Mr. Figuera's projected long-term OSF of 72.85% was \"based on the historical performance of the upgrader from the time it was commissioned through 2015\" (note 199). Mr. Pati\u00f1o did not investigate whether this was correct.\n\n416.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot rely either on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's projections on EHCO supplied from the fields to the extent he assumes that the EHCO volumes required for the CCO sales since 2009 would have dropped, with the effect that no new wells would have been needed. Indeed, this reduction in the production of EHCO suitable for upgrading to CCO has nothing in common with the designed operation under the Association Agreement, which did not allow for regular production of blended oil. The Tribunal has also difficulties in understanding the Respondent's assumption of a decline on the Hamaca field, when Mr. Pati\u00f1o's program scheduled a total of 1,218 wells, more than 170 wells less than the 1,389 wells provided as early as in the 2006 business plan222. In any event, Mr. Pati\u00f1o has been called as an expert and not as a witness.\n\nSee also the Board's Budget 2007 Presentation, Figuera Appendix 75.\n\n417.\n\nIn light of the influence of external factors like the OSF or the reduced production of CCO on his own methodology, Mr. Pati\u00f1o's assumptions cannot assist the Tribunal's decision. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's decline rate is again based on a small sample of wells that he then corrected in reaction to Dr. Strickland's criticism. He also failed to compare his results with the actual production history of the Project.\n\n418.\n\nThe Tribunal can draw similar conclusions when considering the downstream production at the Hamaca site. Indeed, the Tribunal has been provided with the invoices for syncrude and blended oil sold between mid 2007 and 2015. The figures resulting from this documentation allow the determination of the quantities of EHCO that must have been available for such purpose. These figures can also be compared to those retained by Mr. Pati\u00f1o in respect of the field's EHCO production capacity calculated independently from the EHCO production required for the upgrading to CCO only. The results are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Mr. Pati\u00f1o's data | Actual data |\n|  | Active Potential EHCO Pro- duction223 | EHCO Production to Upgrader224 | CCO for sale225 | EHCO required for blending226 | Total EHCO used for upgrading and blending (column 5+8) |\n|  | BPD227 | MMB | BPD | MMB228 | BPD | MMB | MMB | MMB |\n| 2009 | 188,906229 | 68,950,690 | 115,385 | 42,116,000 | 109,270 | 39,884,000 | 6,192,793 | 48,308,793 |\n| 2010 | 165,869 | 60,542,185 | 144,706 | 52,818,000 | 137,036 | 50,018,000 | 0 | 52,818,000 |\n| 2011 | 161,570 | 58,973,050 | 137,275 | 50,105,000 | 130,000 | 47,450,000 | 2,373,606 | 52,478,606 |\n| 2012 | 160,305 | 58,511,325 | 72,747 | 26,625,000 | 68,891 | 25,214,000 | 26,277,368 | 52,902,368 |\n| 2013 | 159,599 | 58,253,635 | 136,353 | 49,769,000 | 129,127 | 47,131,000 | 14,609,112 | 64,378,112 |\n| 2014 | 158,897 | 57,997,405 | 153,203 | 55,919,000 | 145,084 | 52,955,000 | 3,578,852 | 59,497,852 |\n| 2015 | 159,866 | 58,351,090 | 148,377 | 54,158,000 | 140,513 | 51,287,000 | 2,159,519 | 56,317,519 |\n| Sub-total | 1,155,012 | 421,579,380 | 908,046 | 331,510,000 | 859,921 | 313,939,000 | 55,191,250 | 386,701,250 |\n| Ave./ year | 165,002 | 60,225,626 | 129,721 | 47,358,571 | 122,846 | 44,848,429 | 7,884,464 | 55,242,998 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n\nPati\u00f1o Appendix 84, Output.\n\nCf. Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 193; Pati\u00f1o, Appendix 84, Output. These numbers are recalculated from the volumes of CCO mentioned in Mr. Pati\u00f1o's Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 193 (with a yield factor of 0,947); the numbers for CCO have been copied for 2009 to 2013 from Mr. Figuera's Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 8, based on Appendix 42.\n\nThe numbers for 2009-2015 are all copied from Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 193, where Mr. Pati\u00f1o explains that he took them from Mr. Figuera's Third Supplemental Testimony of 15 August 2014, table 1 (para. 8), further referring to his Appendix 84. This is correct for the years 2009-2013. However, Mr. Pati\u00f1o did not observe that Mr. Figuera updated his documentation and submitted a new set of invoices in his Appendix 106, further noting the results in his Fourth Supplemental Testimony of 7 January 2015, table 1, para. 19, from where the numbers on EHCO production have been copied into the Respondent's assessment of Production submitted on 2 June 2017.\n\nThese quantities represent 76.67% of blended oil sold as per the information submitted by the Respondent at the March 2017 Hearing, and also contained in the Hamaca Assessment of Production, p. 15.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o also provides the figures for \"Year Start\", which are slightly different and less suitable for comparison purposes. Cf. Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 193; Pati\u00f1o, Appendix 84, Output.\n\nThe numbers have been rounded by Mr. Pati\u00f1o.\n\nThis figure has not been verified by Mr. Pati\u00f1o. He noted that on 1 January 2009, when he started his production capacity program, this capacity of the field totaled 201.2 MBPD; cf. Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 124; Expert Report, 18 August 2014, para. 141.\n\n419.\n\nFrom 2016 onwards, when he had no actual figures for CCO available, Mr. Pati\u00f1o selected the figures for Potential EHCO Production less 10% to determine EHCO Production to Upgrader and from there (x0,947) CCO. Four years are here selected for the purpose of illustration. As a matter of fact, looking at his table, it is only as from 2025 that the results of his decline study are impacting seriously EHCO production at Hamaca, with a further kick-down in 2027.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Active Potential EHCO Production | EHCO Production to Upgrader | CCO for sale |\n|  | BPD | MMB | BPD | MMB | BPD | MMB |\n| 2017 | 159,766 | 58,314,590 | 143,432 | 52,353,000 | 74,855 | 49,368,000 |\n| 2021 | 159,008 | 58,037,920 | 143,432 | 52,353,000 | 51,757 | 49,368,000 |\n| 2025 | 130,384 | 47,590,160 | 118,473 | 43,243,000 | 21,993 | 40,778,000 |\n| 2029 | 53,825 | 19,646,125 | 48,907 | 17,851,000 | 8,986 | 16,833,000 |\n| Total 2009 to 2037 |  |  |  | 961,622,000 |  | 908,136,000 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n\n420.\n\nAs this has been done for Petrozuata, but avoiding lengthy repetitions, the figures resulting from Mr. Pati\u00f1o's study and the comparison with the figures relating to the production of blended oil require the following comments.\n\n421.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o's volumes for total potential EHCO available on the sites (column 2/3) are always higher than the actual volumes extracted by the wells for the purpose of producing upgraded CCO (column 4/5). This applies for two periods, the one between 2009 and 2015, and the other covering the years 2017 to 2036. Therefore, more EHCO was in fact available than what results from Mr. Pati\u00f1o's conclusions.\n\n422.\n\nWhen the estimated quantities of EHCO to be used for blending are also considered and added to the volumes used for upgrading, the resulting amounts are interesting from two perspectives: (1) the added amount is always higher than the EHCO supplied for upgrading - thus showing that the EHCO taken into the upgrader is below the EHCO available; and (2), there is a difference of about 38,650 BPD compared to the feeding capacity of the upgrader (190,000 BPD). In order to compensate the difference, an extended drilling activity (corresponding to about 45 wells proceeding at a pace of 800 BPD) would be required. Witness Figuera noted that it was possible to bring up the rate of production per well to an initial production of 1400 to 1600 BPD in the short-term230.\n\nTR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3213:20-3214:11. He added that they had not to care about the long-term, which was Venezuela's task.\n\n423.\n\nFor his definition of the available wells, Mr. Pati\u00f1o again identifies the characteristics of wells and their potential decline, but he does not proceed to determine the available potential for new wells and new targets. He examined only 17% of the wells operating on site, arguably because so-called \"erratic\" wells could not be used for such testing231. He also chose a requirement of 20-foot thick sands232 that has been considered as much too rigid233. Witness Lyons commented that if one removes anything less than 20 feet, that is a lot of oil left behind, thus eliminating oil that can be obtained234. PDVSA's decision to require 20-feet thick sands was one of the reasons why it has been argued that the Projects were lacking targets235. A comparison to the quantities of certified Proved Reserves is missing. It is striking that upon Mr. Pati\u00f1o's advice, no further well will be drilled as from 2024, although time is left until 2037 to increase EHCO production.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2583:4-2586:6, 2747:3-2750:19.\n\nCf. Pati\u00f1o, Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 62, 112-114.\n\nStrickland, Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 99-107.\n\nTR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3211:1-3212:2.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3208:18-21 (Figuera), p. 3211:1-11 (Lyons).\n\n424.\n\nAt a closer look at the key points of new wells to be drilled, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Pati\u00f1o projected 754 new wells as from 1 January 2009236, a number that is in the range of the business projections prior to the expropriation. In this regard, Mr. Pati\u00f1o stays very close to the original assessment of production. Here again, the Tribunal finds that the assessment of the decline rate of the wells does not include sufficient consideration of the potential of compensation through new wells and increasing work on maintenance and repair (and the associated increase in costs). This item is only marginally addressed in Mr. Pati\u00f1o's decline analysis237. It has also been noted that the decline of wells productivity had as one of its main causes PDVSA's policy to give priority to single lateral wells. For Witness Lyons, this change of strategy had a most negative effect on productivity238. This circumstance also renders uncertain Mr. Pati\u00f1o's study based on wells decline. He explains, indeed, that in respect of multilateral wells, the information on the remaining reserves and the level of depletion per lateral cannot be managed and ascertained with anything close to precision239. How is it then possible to determine multilateral wells' decline?\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 155.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 106/107.\n\nSecond Witness Statement, 30 October 2009, paras. 10, 11, 13, 24, 30; Fourth Witness Statement, 16 May 2014, para. 21; Fifth Witness Statement, 13 October 2014, paras. 43-48; TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 4, p. 1077:5-1078:17; Day 5, p. 1329:2-1332:13.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 88. Expert Brown objected to Mr. Pati\u00f1o's assumption (Second Witness Statement, 13 October 2014, paras. 11-13).\n\n425.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o's approach is not forward looking. In his First Report, he concluded that \"with a target potential production capacity of 154.6 MPD, the Huyapari field runs out of targets in 2024\"240. Assuming this is correct, why did he not suggest searching for targets above 2024? Was this because he was focusing on a \"target potential production capacity of 154.6 MBD\"? He identified 1,100 wells to be drilled over the life of the field. But he also noted that higher numbers were projected, up to 1,265 producing wells241. This number can be found in a ConocoPhillips's Engineering Report of 2007, identifying \"new producers\" and adding 124 re-drills, providing for a total number of wells drilled of 1389242. Why did he not go this far in light of a production capacity significantly below the Project's target since Mr. Figuera reported that, at the time of migration, ConocoPhillips had projected a capacity of 200 MBD that he considered as having dropped in reality to 186 MBD243? The same report listed more than 50 new producers drilled per year still as from 2024 until 2030. It appears to the Tribunal that Mr. Pati\u00f1o refrained from heading above the number of 154.6 MBD because he was asked\n\n... to estimate the target potential production of the field based on the consideration presented in the Third Supplemental Figuera Direct Testimony relating to the requirements of the upgrader for the period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2013 and Mr. Figuera's estimate of those requirements thereafter. This results in target potential production of approximately 154.6 MBD244.\n\nExpert Report, 18 August 2014, para. 82. The understanding of Dr. Strickland was that Mr. Pati\u00f1o took the actual CCO production and then back calculated what the EHCO volumes would have been in order to produce that (TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 9, p. 2762:8-2763:6).\n\nExpert Report, 18 August 2014, para. 49.\n\nConocoPhillips, Hamaca RCAT Review, Engineering, 7 May 2007, p. 14/pdf (LECG-111). The same number has been retained in the Board of Directors' Presentation of 12 September 2006 (Figuera Appendix 75). Both documents noted that such drilling was being done until about 2032.\n\nFiguera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, para. 47.\n\nExpert Report, 18 August 2014, para. 67. In fact, the number of 154.6 MPD is not mentioned in the Testimony to which Mr. Pati\u00f1o refers.\n\n426.\n\nAnother rigid limitation is adopted by Mr. Pati\u00f1o when he blocks the daily input of EHCO from 2016 until the end of the project at 143,432 BPD and, respectively retains a target of 157,775 BPD which includes a cushion of 10%245. These numbers represent a maximum availability. As the Claimants contend, the figure of 143,432 BPD is obtained when applying an OSF of 72.85% from the design capacity of 190,000 BPD. And Mr. Pati\u00f1o's target of 157,775 BPD is close to 154.6 MBD he quotes as the target taken at the beginning of his study. This observation is in line with Mr. Pati\u00f1o's introduction to his methodology where he notes that Mr. Figuera's estimate of an OSF of 72.85% was part of the information on which his study was based246. Although this is not expressly stated by Mr. Pati\u00f1o, the review of his opinion suggests that in fact he started his study in taking the hypothesis of a maximum rate of 72.85% OSF and then back-calculated the numbers of wells needed to ensure the required EHCO production that was more than 27% behind design capacity247.\n\nCf. Pati\u00f1o, Appendix 84, Output, Upgrader, Field Metrics.\n\nCf. Pati\u00f1o, Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 121, further noting that \"OSF is an important consideration in the Hamaca production capacity program\" (footnote 199). This OSF was thus used by Mr. Pati\u00f1o to determine volumes of EHCO projected for the upgrader (para. 122). The Respondent, Final Brief on Quantum, para. 362, confirms that a 72.85% OSF was an assumption on which Mr. Pati\u00f1o's conclusions were based. It was part of Mr. Pati\u00f1o's instructions: cf.

Cf. Cost Estimation for Petrozuata, p. 14, 43/44, 48, 52/53, 56/57, and Hamaca, p. 15, 55, 59/60, 64/65, 69/70, 74; Brailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 308, 315.\n\n427.\n\nThe Respondent248 and its valuation experts249 adopt the approach and the results of Mr. Pati\u00f1o's method and report, further including in their presentations on the *ex ante* profile the figures relating to the historical period between 26 June 2007 and the end of 2008250. Their conclusions are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | EHCO Production to Upgrader | CCO for sale |\n|  | BPD | MMB | BPD | MMB |\n| Mr. Figuera |  |  |  |  |\n| End 2007 | 171,629 | 31,570,422 | 157,341 | 28,939,154 |\n| 2008 | 158,777 | 58,112,475 | 143,253 | 52,430,724 |\n| subtotal | 163,061 | 89,682,897 | 147,949 | 81,369,878 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Mr. Pati\u00f1o |  |  |  |  |\n| 2009-2037 |  | 961,622,000251 |  | 908,136,000252 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Total |  | 1,051,304,897 |  | 989,505,878 |\n\nCf. Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 363; the numbers for 2007 and 2008 are contained in the *ex ante* table, para. 157.\n\nCf. Brailowsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 259; the numbers for 2007 and 2008 are contained in the *ex ante* table, para. 74.\n\nThey were taken from Figuera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, paras. 37-39; TR-E, 2017 March 2016, Day 14, p. 4267:1315, 4269:13-15, 4271:13-15, 4273:15-19 (Preziosi).\n\nThis number became 959,823 in Mr. Pati\u00f1o's last update under Appendix 89. However, he stated that the difference was negligible and he did not use it in his Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 137, 193, nor did he use the figures composing this final amount. The Respondent and its valuation experts have equally not adapted their figures to this last version.\n\nAs this has been observed above in relation to Mr. Pati\u00f1o's numbers on CCO sold between 2009 and 2015 (column 6/7) they were copied from Mr. Figuera' Third Supplemental Statement, 15 August 2014, para. 8, table 1 and the attached Appendix 42, not noting that Mr. Figuera had updated his information in his Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, para. 19, table 1 and the attached Appendix 106. The Respondent and its valuation experts have relied on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's numbers, with the effect that their numbers are equally incorrect, and, as a consequence, any subsequent calculation based on them.\n\n428.\n\nTo conclude, the Respondent's presentation, tied to Mr. Pati\u00f1o's analysis exclusively focused on decline rates, cannot be retained by the Tribunal. No evidence has been brought before the Tribunal that the production at Hamaca may be limited to quantities significantly lower than the upgrader's design capacity of 190,000 BPD, which corresponds to 69,350,000 MMB. For the period between 2009 and 2015, the figures provided by Mr. Figuera, combined with the EHCO required for the sale of blended oil, confirm this assessment:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009 2015 | EHCO Produced253 | CCO Produced254 | EHCO required for CCO invoiced | CCO Invoices255 | Blended Oil Sold256 | EHCO required for blending (76.67%) | Total EHCO used for upgrading and blending (column 4 and 7) |\n| 2009 | 45,723,407 | 39,675,000 | 42,075,382 | 39,845,387 | 8,077,205 | 6,192,794 | 48,268,176 |\n| 2010 | 53,540,415 | 49,459,910 | 52,236,706 | 49,468,161 | 0 | 0 | 52,236,706 |\n| 2011 | 57,523,545 | 46,783,000 | 50,105,448 | 47,449,859 | 3,095,873 | 2,373,606 | 52,479,054 |\n| 2012 | 60,903,301 | 26,782,000 | 26,625,256 | 25,214,117 | 34,208,123 | 26,227,368 | 52,852,624 |\n| 2013 | 58,430,039 | 47,602,000 | 49,768,987 | 47,131,231 | 19,054,535 | 14,609,112 | 64,378,099 |\n| 2014 | 56,553,345 | 53,190,000 | 55,919,208 | 52,955,490 | 4,667,865 | 3,578,852 | 59,498,060 |\n| 2015 2016 | 54,927,758 | 50,946,000 | 54,157,769 | 51,287,407 | 2,816,642 | 2,159,519 | 56,317,288 |\n| total | 387,601,810 | 314,437,910 | 330,888,756 | 313,351,652 | 71,920,243 | 55,141,251 | 386,030,007 |\n| Av. p/year | 55,371,687 | 44,919,701 | 47,269,822 | 44,764,522 | 10,274,320 | 7,877,322 | 55,147,144 |\n| p/day, BPD | 151,703 | 123,068 | 122,506 | 122,643 | 28,149 | 21,582 | 151,088 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n\nHamaca Assessment of Production, p. 15; Figuera, 4th Supplemental Testimony, para. 19. Comparable figures, translated into BPD, can be found in the PetroPiar Financial Statement for the years 2009 to 2012 (CLEX-094, p. 210, 259/pdf).\n\nHamaca Assessment of Production, p. 15; Figuera, Appendix 107. The EHCO required for the production of the quantities of CCO mentioned in the table (column 4) represents numbers lower than those mentioned above under EHCO Produced (column 2). As explained by Mr. Figuera, the Project produced more EHCO than the quantities of EHCO required for the CCO that was produced, according to his figures. The EHCO quantities required for the upgrading to CCO are provided in Mr. Figuera's Fourth Supplemental Testimony, and they can be calculated by dividing the figures of CCO Produced (column 3) by the yield factor of 0,947 (*e.g.* 44,919,701 CCO p/year: 0,947 = 47,433,686 EHCO).\n\nSubmitted by Respondent at the 2017 March Hearing, with corrections for years 2009 and 2010 in Annex 7 of Respondent's Answers of 10 July 2017.\n\nSubmitted by the Respondent at the 2017 March Hearing; Hamaca Assessment of Production, p. 15, referring to Figuera Appendices 110, 111. Blended oil is composed of 76.67% EHCO and 23.33% diluent, mostly naphtha.\n\n429.\n\nAt this juncture, the figures to be retained are those relating to the EHCO Production Capacity. As mentioned above, the EHCO Production required for CCO Production is noted for informational purposes, because these quantities reflect the operational choices made as from 2009, with the effect that the CCO production was significantly reduced, albeit complemented by the sale of blended oil. None of the numbers for EHCO required for CCO invoiced (column 4) comes close to the quantities fed to the upgrader in the second half of 2007 (31,570,422 MMB) and 2008 (58,112,475 MMB). The drop that occurred in 2009 was therefore based on reasons other than the performance of the upgrader, which was under the control of PDVSA in that period of 2007/2008 and since 2009.\n\n430.\n\nTo obtain the approximate volumes of EHCO that would have been available when no blending had been permitted, the amount of EHCO required for the production of the relevant corresponding CCO sold has to be added to the EHCO portion of 76.67% in the blended oil257. As shown in the table above, the amounts thus reached (column 8) are similar or very close to those reported as overall \"EHCO Production\" by Mr. Figuera (column 2). Approximate amounts of 55,200,000 MMB and 151,200 BPD can thus be retained as actual EHCO production figures experienced per year between 2009 and 2015.\n\nThe resulting figures are comparable to the numbers shown by Mr. Figuera as \"EHCO Produced\". However, they are far below the EHCO Production Capacity reported by Mr. Pati\u00f1o.\n\n431.\n\nThese amounts increase slightly if one also includes the results of the EHCO production following the 18 months since the expropriation up to the end of 2008, when a total of 89,682,897 MMB has been produced, at an average of 163,061 BPD. In appropriate proportions, this allows the conclusion that in the period since the expropriation until the end of 2015, an actual average amount of 56,000,000 MMB per year has been produced, corresponding to 153,500 BPD.\n\n432.\n\nWhen considering the EHCO production capacity reported by Mr. Pati\u00f1o, it appears that his figures are above those required to produce the CCO that was actually sold in the years 2009 to 2015258. Indeed, he determined numbers for actual potential EHCO production between 57,977,405 MMB (corresponding to 159,866 BPD in 2015) and 68,950,690 MMB (188,906 BPD in 2009), at an average per year of 60,225,626 MMB, which is clearly above the figures quoted above and derived from Mr. Figuera's presentations.\n\nAs a matter of fact, looking at his table, it is only as from 2024 that the results of his decline study are impacting seriously EHCO production at Hamaca.\n\n433.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o is not a fact witness providing evidence relating to these figures. However, the Respondent and its valuation experts rely on them. Mr. Figuera's numbers are derived from actual numbers he retrieved when looking at thousands of invoices and reports to the Ministry on EHCO production. The difference is in a range of 4%, which is negligible when considering the many other factors that may have an impact (positive or negative) on the operation of such machinery as an upgrader.\n\n434.\n\nThe Claimants have not provided annual numbers in their briefs. They were then submitted in their tables on production filed on 20 March 2017 where it was explained that the annual numbers were copied by their experts from the COP-Composite-Economic-Model of 2006 (CEM) (LECG-085), but expressed through more precise numbers in a December 2006 Full Valuation (CLEX-86). The numbers provided in these two documents mostly coincide and support an average production rate of 175,000 BPD (corresponding to a yearly total of 63,875,000 MMB) that is adopted by the Claimants and its experts259 from the beginning of the post-expropriation period, with the exceptions of turnaround years and without counting blended oil reported as sold during turnaround.\n\nConsolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 54.\n\n435.\n\nThe EHCO production of 175,000 BPD initially alleged by the Claimants must be reduced on the basis of the Claimants' own observations. This number was based on an OSF of 92% as it had been submitted by the Claimants. In light of the 91% OSF adopted later in the proceeding, this figure would become 172,900 BPD and per year 63,108,500 MMB.\n\n436.\n\nThese quantities are above the actual figures for the period between 2009 and 2015 (55,200,000 MMB, 151,200 BPD), but closer to the actual average amount for the post-expropriation period in the years 2007 to 2015 (56,000,000 MMB, 153,500 BPD). The Tribunal finds no evidence and no convincing argument that would prevent it from retaining these figures for EHCO production at Hamaca if the Association Agreements with the Claimants as partners had remained in place. These are standard figures based on the production capacity of the fields. They will have to be reviewed in light of the production capacity of the upgrader.\n\n437.\n\nA further observation must be added: Mr. Pati\u00f1o notes a sharp decline for Hamaca for the last ten years of the Project's lifetime. Production of EHCO drops from 2025 and three years later it reaches the level of half of the quantities recovered between 2012 and 2024. The Claimants' experts note a drop in 2031260. This needs to be further considered below (F).\n\nConsolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 54.\n\n438.\n\nBefore that, the next question is to determine whether the available EHCO production is capable of being upgraded.\n\nE. The Processing Capacity of the Upgraders\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Basic elements*\n-------------------\n\n439.\n\nAccording to the constraints accepted in the Association Agreements, the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects were focused on the production of syncrude (CCO) through a process of upgrading of extra-heavy crude oil (EHCO), to the exclusion of blended oil that is mixed with other oils and not processed through an upgrader. Each Project had one upgrader available for such purpose, each being constructed so as to be able to process a certain maximum quantity of oil per day over the life-time of the Projects. In terms of EHCO, this quantity was, approximately, for Petrozuata 120,000, and for Hamaca 190,000 barrels per day (BPD).\n\n440.\n\nEHCO was not delivered to the upgrader in that quality. Given its very high viscosity, it had to be diluted with naphtha in order to be capable of being processed as DCO from the wells through a pipeline to the upgrader. It is not disputed that the respective quantities of such mixed or diluted EHCO were 76.67% undiluted EHCO and 23.33% naphtha. Once arrived at the upgrader, the original EHCO was separated from the naphtha; while the latter was sent back to the fields, the remaining EHCO entered into the upgrading process.\n\n441.\n\nIn order to take the measure of the quantity of CCO available for sale, the capacity of the upgrader is determined in relation to the quantity of EHCO that can be introduced. The relation between the resulting CCO and the incoming EHCO is determined by a \"yield factor\" that expresses the quantity of EHCO in relation to the resulting CCO. If this factor is 94.7% or 0,947 (as it is at Hamaca), one barrel of EHCO becomes 0,947 barrel of CCO. Thus, the upgrader of Hamaca was designed to produce 179,600 BPD261 of CCO, and the upgrader of Petrozuata 104,000 BPD (the yield factor being 0.8621).\n\nThe precise figures for EHCO and CCO capacity of the Hamaca upgrader are uncertain. 179,600 BPD is frequently quoted for CCO and used here. Given the yield factor of 0,947, it would correspond to 189,600 BPD of EHCO (cf. Earnest, Consolidated Expert Report of October 17, 2016, paras. 10, 34, 56). However, the capacity for EHCO is in general given as 190,000 BPD.\n\n442.\n\nGiven the relation between EHCO and naphtha when mixed together as DCO, the amount of EHCO required to fill up the upgrader at maximum capacity is in a proportion of 76.67% compared to the quantity of DCO provided from the fields. Thus, one barrel of DCO includes 0.7667 barrel of EHCO that yields 0.7261 barrel of CCO at a yield factor of 94.7% (in the case of Hamaca). Therefore, when the upgrader had a capacity of 190,000 BPD of EHCO, it had an initial throughput of 247,800 BPD of DCO (comprising 57,800 BPD of diluent).\n\n443.\n\nThe maximum capacity for the production of CCO was not defined in real terms but as a designed quantity of EHCO that each upgrader was actually capable of processing. The relation between this designed optimal capacity of CCO and the quantity of CCO actually treated at a certain point of time, or rather over a certain period, is expressed as the \"on-stream factor\" (OSF). The OSF is a metric that describes the operational efficiency of an upgrader or refinery262. It is a measure of actual CCO production against the design rate for CCO production263. It reflects the ratio of actual syncrude production (CCO) to the upgrader's design capacity. In fact, the OSF is the key number or percentage that identifies the availability and capacity of treatment of the upgrader, and, ultimately, the resulting quantities of CCO that can possibly be put on the market for sale. Thus, in the case of Hamaca, the OSF is a measure of actual CCO production against the design rate for CCO production of 179,600 BPD. If the upgrader operates at a 91% OSF (as alleged by the Claimants), it can be expected to produce 163,400 BPD of CCO (when receiving 189,600 BPD of EHCO, the yield factor being 0,947). If it runs at a 84.26% OSF or at a 73% OSF (both figures used by the Respondent), it will produce 151,331, respectively 131,100 BPD of CCO. From another perspective but again for the Hamaca upgrader, it can be determined that whereas an OSF of 100% represents 179,600 BPD of CCO, 1% OSF equals 1796 BPD. This also means that a shutdown of the whole upgrader can be measured by days but also by its effects on the OSF. A loss of 1796 BPD equals a 1% OSF reduction. This also explains that the OSF is used as expressing a percentage of time that a refinery is running at its design capacity264.\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 214.\n\nRespondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 117, note 229.\n\nCf. Claimants' Memorial on Quantum, 19 May 2014, para.143.\n\n444.\n\nSometimes the OSF is used differently, as a factor based on the actual volume of incoming EHCO. It has been noted, indeed, that the OSF can in principle be calculated using either EHCO or CCO production figures265. When referring to EHCO, the OSF can be used as expressing the quantity of EHCO delivered to the upgrader. Thus, again in the case of Hamaca, assuming the upgrader operates at an OSF of 91% (as submitted by the Claimants), this can have the meaning that it receives an EHCO production of 172,900 that is then upgraded to 163,736 CCO (using the yield factor of 0,947). In the hypothesis of a 84.26% or a 73% OSF (both figures used by the Respondent), the upgrader will produce 151,331, respectively 131,100 BPD of CCO, which can mean that the supply of EHCO is limited to 159,800 or 138,437 BPD (using again the yield factor of 0,947).\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 246, note 391.\n\n445.\n\nIn sum, the OSF can be understood in two ways: (1) Either it expresses a decrease in the performance capacities of the upgrader, which produces CCO below its design capacity266; or (2) the OSF goes downwards because of a reduction in the EHCO quantities provided from the fields, which has also the effect of lowering CCO volumes below the design capacity. An additional factor for which no evidence on quantities was provided relates to the processing of EHCO delivered to the upgraders of Petrozuata and Hamaca from other sites in the Orinoco fields267.\n\nThis option is expressed by Mr. Earnest when he refers to a loss of operating proficiency at the Hamaca upgrader; cf. Technical Assessment of the Hamaca and Petrozuata Upgrader Performance, 13 October 2014, para. 11; Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 55. However, this does not, by itself, dispose of the other option that understands the downward trend in OSF performance as a decrease in the volume of EHCO supplied.\n\nCf. Figuera, Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, para. 22; Earnest, Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 66.\n\n*2. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n446.\n\nThe Claimants explain that by its third year of commercial operation in 2004, the Petrozuata upgrader achieved an OSF of roughly 97%, which the Claimants represent as \"world-class\". The upgrader was still \"best in class\" until 2007, subject to a cut in EHCO production based on an OPEC limitation applicable in 2007268. At that time, the upgrader was operated by the Petrozuata joint venture company. Since the expropriation, it has been operated and maintained exclusively by PDVSA.\n\nCf. Lyons, Second Supplemental Testimony, 17 May 2010, para. 17; TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2222:15-2224:3, 2233:14-2235:5.\n\n447.\n\nThe Claimants note that Venezuela alleges that subsequent to the expropriation, PDVSA has encountered operational problems that have reduced the OSF of the Petrozuata upgrader. With one exception, all of these problems are said to have arisen in 2009, long after the Claimants had left Venezuela. Mr. Earnest concludes that the problems on which Venezuela seeks to rely in fact result from PDVSA's own technically poor operation of the upgrader. Such deficiencies cannot be attributed to the Claimants.\n\n448.\n\nVenezuela tacitly acknowledges that the reduced performance of the upgrader results, at least in part, from PDVSA's own technical failings. The Claimants have noted that Mr. Figuera attributes upgrader downtime in 2014 and 2015 to \"equipment failures and operational errors\"269. An outage of the delayed coker unit in 2013 occurred \"due to operator error\" and Mr. Figuera explained that this incident led to a shutdown of the entire upgrader for 45 days, and a consequent 12.3% reduction in the upgrader's OSF for 2013270. Mr. Earnest noted that one would not expect a 45-days shutdown for this reason from a competently run organization271. The government inspectors reported in 2015 on a serious deterioration of upgrading facilities under PDVSA's management, further noting PDVSA's negligence in its operation of the Orinoco Belt Projects (C-649). PDVSA's deficiencies cannot be properly imputed to the Claimants in the but-for scenario.\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 219, referring to a statement of Mr. Figuera before the ICC Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nThird Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 95.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 136.\n\n449.\n\nIn respect of the more controversial production capacity of the Hamaca upgrader, the Claimants recall once again that their experts have used a conservative approach. They relied upon the average production figure for Hamaca of 175,000 BPD of EHCO through the terminal years of the contractual period. This level of production implies an OSF for the Hamaca Upgrader of approximately 91%272. That OSF figure matches the expectation of all Project participants (including PDVSA) prior to the expropriation, as reflected in the 2005 Hamaca Business Plan (C-341, p. 39) and the 2006 Project's Economic Model (LECG-129). Mr. Earnest concludes that this OSF projection is both reasonable and attainable273.\n\nIn the Claimants' Memorial on Quantum, 19 May 2014, para. 144, this production figure implies an OSF of approximately 92%.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 68-79.\n\n450.\n\nThe RAM (\"Reliability, Availability and Maintainability\") Studies that have been commissioned by the Project partners predicted an average long-term OSF of between 84% and 93%. The Hamaca Project's Board of Directors evaluated RAM IV and its predecessor reports and concluded that there was a range between 85% and 95% (C-344, 470).\n\n451.\n\nActual upgrader performance in the pre-expropriation period confirms the Project partners conclusion that a long-term OSF of 91% would reasonably be achieved. In 2005, the first full year of commercial operation, a 89% OSF was achieved. In 2006, the OSF averaged over 91% in the first five months of that year274. The Project partners accordingly concluded that the upgrader's OSF would continue to rise in later years, as reflected in the Project's successive Business Plans for 2005 and 2006275. The 2005 Plan, the last approved by the Hamaca Board276, prior to the expropriation, shows that the parties expected the OSF to rise to 94.8% in 2007, and remain at rates above 90%, except in turnaround years277.\n\nThe Board of Directors noted in May 2006 a current OSF of 91-92%; C-344, Figuera Appendix 25.\n\nC-341, C-346. Witness Figuera expressed doubts whether the members of the Board understood the challenge they were accepting in the 2006 Plan, but he was not present at the meeting; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3263:514, 3264:14-16, 3265:12-19.\n\nIt was said that this Plan had not been formally approved because of some uncertainties in 2007, relating to access to the Reserve Area and the question how long the OPEC cuts will last. Cf. Witness Lyons, TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 7, p. 2008:20-2009:12; 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3284:1-3287:22.\n\nCf. also Witness Lyons, TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3265:22-3267:17, 3270:19-3271:15, noting an actual OSF of 91.4% in 2005.\n\n452.\n\nTo insure this result, the Project partners agreed on a detailed capital investment program to enhance and sustain the upgrader's OSF, as reflected in the extracts from the Project's 20072008 Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) budget (C-473). Additional expenditures were also contemplated for later years. The Project partners' expectations were reasonable and achievable. Mr. Earnest concluded that the budgeted improvement measures would be expected to yield a long-term OSF of approximately 91% - consistent with the figure adopted in the Project's Economic Model, and the Claimants' damages model.\n\n453.\n\nThe Claimants note that Venezuela insists that the long-term OSF should be fixed at 72.85% for the remaining 21-year duration of the Project's term. This figure is the latest advanced figure by Mr. Figuera and it is said to be based on PDVSA's own post-expropriation performance at Hamaca. First, there is strong evidence that PDVSA's post-expropriation operation of the Projects has suffered from profound deficiencies that must be imputed to PDVSA, and not to the Claimants in the but-for scenario. Second, Mr. Figuera refers to wrong figures. He reports an OSF of 87.63% for 2005, while the minutes of a Hamaca Board meeting report a year-end OSF of 89% (C-344, C561, C-614). Third, Venezuela acknowledges that Hamaca has been bypassing the upgrader and selling large quantities of non-upgraded products since 2009, with the effect that the OSF is artificially reduced. In this respect, Venezuela has not shown that the upgrader was not capable of processing those extra volumes. Fourth, Venezuela's proposed long-term OSF of 72.85% is not credible. If correct, it would mean that the upgrader would be off-line nearly 30% of the time, for each of the coming 20 years. For the same period, Venezuela claims that PetroPiar will spend billions of dollars on upgrader turnarounds, maintenance and improvements; such activities had the purpose of improving the integrity of the upgrader, which was meant to achieve a higher OSF (C-341, C346). This is confirmed in a Report of the company on the 2009 turnaround (C-584). In sum, the evidence supports the expectations of the Hamaca partners that a long-term OSF of 91% would be attained. Venezuela's figure of 72.85% is unreliable and unrealistic.\n\n454.\n\nThe Claimants also object to Venezuela's main argument about the upgrader's deficiencies, which relate to the coker and the vibration levels experienced there. The coker is the part of the upgrader that strips out the heavier elements in the EHCO to yield lighter, more valuable hydrocarbons. The Project partners made the resolution of this problem a priority. A list of corrective measures was set up (C-340, C-346). Mr. Figuera conceded that the coker vibration has not impacted syncrude production at Hamaca. However, Venezuela asserts that the coker vibration poses a \"risk of catastrophic failure\"278. Venezuela's quantum experts adopt a 10% annually compounded probability of upgrader destruction279. This reduces the value of the Project by US$ 2 billion (16%). Venezuela offers no technical justification for the 10% figure. No responsible company would continue operating a coker that actually posed a significant risk to the surrounding facility and its workers. Nine years after the expropriation, the problem has not been corrected. Only in 2012 a third party was commissioned to proceed with an assessment of the vibration issue (Chevron Energy Technology Company, CETC). The CETC report280 proposed a correction to the coker structure with the effect of reducing structural drum vibrations. Mr. Earnest agrees and considers that the measure as proposed will almost certainly resolve the coker vibration issue. Nevertheless, Pe-troPiar has not completed the implementation of the CETC solution.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Quantum, 7 January 2015, para. 441.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para 261.\n\nFiguera Appendix 72.\n\n455.\n\nThe economic consequences of the coker issue suggested by Venezuela are absurd. Venezuela claims that PetroPiar will make multi-billion-dollar investments to maintain and improve the upgrader. If this was true, it would be cheaper to replace the coker, at US$ 600 million costs as estimated by Mr. Figuera281. The losses incurred during the replacement could be bypassed by selling blended products. At the ICC hearing, the Respondent's experts conceded that the probability of a coker failure has no technical basis.\n\nTestimony, 20 July 2009, para. 52; Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, para. 43.\n\n456.\n\nThe Respondent alleges other operational problems that, in its view, diminish the efficiency of PetroPiar's operations and should be reflected in the valuation related to the Hamaca Project and its upgrader. None of these problems has any specific impact on the valuation. Thus, naphthenic acid corrosion is a common problem at refineries and can be remedied; the record shows that this was a recognized issue prior to the expropriation and was being resolved (C-379). There is no evidence that the alleged quality issues Mr. Figuera raises in respect of EHCO (in particular a lower gravity) have had any effect on the syncrude production; Mr. Earnest explains that Venezuela has vastly overstated the potential impact of EHCO quality on production levels282. The alleged collapse of storage tank 12 in 2011 was due to a fire caused by an operator error; that is PDVSA's responsibility, and any resulting losses would have been covered by PetroPiar's insurance policy.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 140.\n\n*3. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that the Hamaca upgrader was commissioned in October 2004, with a design throughput of 247,000 BPD of diluted crude oil (DCO), comprised of approximately 190,000 BPD of EHCO and 57,000 BPD of diluent, and a design output of about 179,600 BPD of CCO. The Project had a term through August 2037. The performance of the upgrader was the main concern at Hamaca. A number of Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (\"RAM\") studies were made, ultimately showing that the upgrader would have a long-term OSF of about 84%, a figure far below the OSF in excess of 91% plus included in the business plan.\n\n458.\n\nThe Respondent has established that the CCO production profile for the Hamaca Project used by the Claimants is unfounded because of the serious limitations at the Project's upgrader. The evolution of the OSF at Hamaca indicates that as more information became available, the prospects for the upgrader's long-term performance diminished. The estimated long-term OSF for the Hamaca upgrader dropped at each of the four RAM studies that have been commissioned between 1999 and 2006.\n\n459.\n\nRAM I283 was issued in June 1999 and it concluded, based on the limited information available at the time, that the upgrader could achieve the original target of 93% OSF. RAM II284 was prepared in 2002 (after the detailed engineering for the upgrader was nearly completed) and noted increased failure frequency of heat exchangers, columns and electrical supply, as well as failures of other components not considered in the RAM I study. The long-term OSF predicted by RAM II was 86.4% and it noted that there was no chance of achieving the targeted 93% availability level. RAM III285 was issued in November 2003, after the construction of the upgrader was about 60% completed. It was conducted by a different company than RAM II, using however a similar methodology. It concluded that the long-term OSF was 85.37% and also confirmed that there was no chance to achieve the 93% OSF that had been envisaged. RAM IV286 was undertaken in 2006 after the upgrader had been constructed and had been operating for more than a year. It considered a total of 1,354 components and was based on real data from the Petrolera Ameriven databases. It took into account the modifications that have been made during the construction, and was also based on reliability studies that were then made available. RAM IV concluded that the long-term OSF would be 84.38%, but depending upon the nature of further improvements being undertaken, the mean OSF could be increased either to 86.32% or 87.87%. Thus, there was a potential for improvement of 3.4%. RAM IV also explained that upstream failures could have the effect of reducing the OSF down to 82.35%. The range of possible OSF was therefore between a \"most representative\" 84.38% and a \"best practices\" of 87.87%.\n\nFiguera Appendix 19.\n\nFiguera Appendix 20.\n\nFiguera Appendix 21.\n\nFiguera Appendix 9.\n\n460.\n\nThe key conclusions to be drawn from the RAM studies are that (a) the projected OSF steadily declined as more information became available; (b) RAM II, III and IV all indicate no chance of achieving either the 93% long-term OSF target established at the beginning of the Project or the 91% OSF that forms the basis of the Claimants' projections as of 26 June 2007; and (c) the OSFs for the most representative scenario established in RAM IV were 84.38% and 86.32 following metallurgy improvements, reduced to 82.28% and 84.22% when potential upstream failures are taken into account. All of the information and conclusions contained in the RAM reports supports the use of an OSF of 84.26% in the *ex ante* analysis.\n\n461.\n\nThe Claimants have attempted to diminish the significance of the trend exposed by the RAM reports. Mr. Earnest noted a change in methodology between RAM I and II, and RAM III, which was operated by a different company. For the Respondent, what is clear is that RAM III and RAM IV were performed by the same company. These reports were made within a period of two years and the estimated OSF dropped again. The company that conducted both RAM I and RAM II was the same company that was in charge of the design and construction of the Hamaca upgrader. Thus, the drop in the OSF is even more telling. The only possible conclusion that can be drawn from the RAM reports is that the projected long-term OSF dropped further away from the 93% OSF that was deemed achievable at the outset.\n\n462.\n\nThe Claimants argued that the Project expected an OSF of 91% or greater, relying on an incomplete version of the minutes of the November 17, 2005 meeting of the Board of Directors, whereas the full version of the minutes (based on the Spanish original) shows that in order to reach such result it \"would be a challenge for Ameriven during the next years\". Together with this proviso, the Board of Directors permitted the Project to proceed on the basis of a \"Best in World\" OSF assumption of 91.4% in the 2005 business plan. At the same meeting, the members of the Petrolera Hamaca Operating Committee (OPCOM) recognized that the \"best in world scenario\" included in the 2005 business plan was a \"target\". They stated that the actual OSF was 84%.\n\n463.\n\nThe RAM IV study constitutes the best evidence of what could reasonably be expected from the Hamaca upgrader over the long term. The results of that study - 82.35% until metallurgy improvements could be implemented during the upcoming turnaround in 2009 and 84.26% thereafter - reflect the reality that the Hamaca upgrader suffered from severe problems. The 91% OSF used by Claimants is nothing more than an aspiration.\n\n464.\n\nAs a matter of fact, at the Hamaca upgrader, with the exception of 2005, the OSF has never reached even the level predicted by RAM IV, much less the 91% plus OSF used by the Claimants. The OSF from 2005 through 2015, calculated as from either CCO production or CCO sales, result in an average of 73.06%, respectively 72.85% OSF.\n\n465.\n\nThe Claimants ignore actual performance in their *ex post* valuation and point to a number of \"publicly available reports\", affirming that the upgrader actually operated at a much higher OSF than reflected in the Respondent's presentation. The OPEC Annual Statistical Bulletin for 2013 reported that the Hamaca upgrader was operating at a higher output rate that what had been expected in 2006. But the figures used in the Bulletin relate to the DCO feed rate, not the EHCO content of the DCO feed. The figures that should be compared to the Claimants' 175,000 BPD of EHCO feed are around 146,000 BPD for 2010 and 141,000 BPD for 2011, as those figures represent the EHCO in the DCO feed when the capacity of the upgrader is 190,800 BPD of DCO and 184,200 BPD of DCO, respectively. The Claimants' reference to the output of the upgrader is a further confusing distortion. The output is CCO, not DCO or EHCO. Given the figures in the OPEC Bulletin, the CCO output was approximately 138,532 BPD in 2010 and 133,741 BPD in 2011.\n\n466.\n\nMr. Lyons referred to a September 2012 article (C-560) where it was stated that the facility will produce 243,000 BPD, compared with 180,000 BPD before the shutdown. These figures relate to the DCO throughput, not EHCO, nor CCO. After the extensive turnaround/PRAC in 2012, the OSF of the upgrader in 2013 was only 71.90%, which was slightly lower than the OSF in 2011 (72.38%).\n\n467.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimants are wrong when they contend that the purpose of the turnarounds is to achieve a higher OSF over time. That is another of the Claimants' mystifying arguments. The OSF was 72.85% for the eleven-year period from 2005 through 2015. The hopes that turnarounds and other major maintenance activity will improve the OSF, including the enormous expenditures required, have not yielded the sustained results. Among others, the Hamaca Project has engaged in major maintenance and improvement activities post-nationalization. An extensive turnaround in 2009 lasted 65 days and cost US$ 223.7 million; the OSF did not improve. As result of the poor performance of the upgrader notwithstanding the 2009 turnaround, a multidisciplinary team was set up that determined that the processing capacity at the upgrader was limited in 2010 to approximately 145,000 BPD of EHCO. Two plans were then prepared, the PRAC (Restoration Plan for Critical Assets) and the PREM (Restoration Plan for Major Equipment), the latter of which was expected to be carried out annually from 2012 through 2022. The PRAC was carried out in 2012 together with the turnaround, for a total cost of US$ 313.2 million. The first PREM was conducted in 2012, and the second in 2013. But the OSF in 2013 was only about 72%.\n\n468.\n\nIn sum, the upgrader at the Hamaca Project has never come close to achieving an OSF of 91% on a long-term basis, and even following major maintenance activity, OSF improvements have been short-lived. There is no basis to conclude that in a \"but-for\" world, the OSF would have been higher than it has been in the historical period. There is nothing that would support the notion that the Hamaca upgrader would have performed at a better OSF had a ConocoPhillips subsidiary remained in the Project.\n\n469.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that the focus of the RAM studies was on mechanical limitations, but other important factors had an adverse impact on CCO production. RAM IV did not take into account the fact that the EHCO feedstock could vary significantly from what was expected. Shortly before the nationalization, the Hamaca Project realized that the EHCO that was being fed to the upgrader had an approximate API gravity of 7.7 degrees, lower than the 8.6 degree API gravity on which the design feed was based. Lower API gravity correlates to a lower concentration of the lighter petroleum constituents, and also to higher viscosity. This in turn results in (i) a lower percentage of EHCO in the DCO and (ii) a lower inherent EHCO-to-CCO conversion (yield) rate for the EHCO component of the DCO. The result is that less CCO could be produced compared to the design specifications. At the time of nationalization, it was anticipated that the API gravity of the EHCO would drop further over time, to about 7.0 degrees API.\n\n470.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that the EHCO at Hamaca had a less favorable chemical composition than had been expected, which can have a significant impact on upgrader performance and the quality of the CCO produced, with a corresponding impact on value. For example, metals content poisons the catalysts that are critical to the upgrading process. The increase in the metals caused increasing costs for more frequent catalyst replacements. High metals content tends to reduce the OSF because shutdowns of significant duration are required in order to replace the catalysts.\n\n471.\n\nConradson Carbon Residue (CCR) measures the coke-forming propensities of a crude oil. Higher CCR numbers tend to correlate to reduced volumes of \"on-spec\" CCO, because less of the lighter, higher value CCO will be produced. Similarly, the Total Acid Number (\"TAN\") is an important indicator of the corrosive characteristics of the material in question. This causes corrosion problems for the ultimate refining customers and affects the price of the Hamaca CCO. The Claimants and Mr. Earnest have attempted to diminish the impact of the serious corrosion problem, claiming that the Project was properly addressing it through metallurgy upgrades. At a meeting of the Petrolera Hamaca Operating Committee on 8 February 2006, it was noted that an appropriate corrosion inspection could not be conducted at the upgrader prior to the first turnaround, because of the difficulty to locate the corrosion problems. The Claimants referred to the 22 February 2007 meeting of the Hamaca Board of Directors for the proposition that the corrosion problem was \"being addressed\". In fact, the only thing that had been done was to place a purchase order for heat exchangers with upgraded metallurgy, equipment that had been identified much earlier. What was clear is that there was a substantial risk that both the scope and estimated expenditures would not improve upgrader performance dramatically. Indeed, the RAM IV OSF following major metallurgy upgrades was projected to be only 84.26%\n\n472.\n\nFinally, the sulfur level associated with the feedstock processed at the upgrader is an important issue in determining crude quality and pricing. Sulfur in crude is undesirable because of issues related to corrosion, environmental pollution and human toxicity. Upgrading equipment that comes in contact with sulfur-containing crude oil and petroleum fractions will degrade more quickly, increasing maintenance costs and upgrader unavailability. The sulfur issue can be addressed by means of upgraded metallurgy, but this increases capital costs and has therefore an influence on the price of CCO. Sulfur will be converted to various sulfur oxides during the combustion process, and then becomes an air problem. In sum, the quality of the EHCO feed to the upgrader was identified as a potential problem early in the life of the Hamaca Project.\n\n473.\n\nAn important item that deserves special attention is the significant risks associated with the vibrations at the coker structure and the impact those risks would have on the prospects of the Hamaca Project. The issue resulted in the formation of a special Vibration Mitigation Project Team in 2005. The vibrations could cause a failure of the coke drum overhead vapor lines that carry the entire content of the high-temperature, highly combustible effluent of the delayed coking reaction process. A leak or failure in these lines could have catastrophic consequences for the continued viability of the upgrader. At a meeting in November 2005, the Project's Operations Committee categorized a \"Catastrophic Piping Collapse\" as a risk having \"high consequences with high probability\". Foster Wheeler, a leading U.S. Licensor of delayed coking technology stated that the problem represented \"a high potential threat\"287. A request for funds was made in April 2007, justified by an abnormal level of vibration, representing a high potential threat on personal safety, mechanical integrity of piping and major impact on production. It was noted that there were no industrial standards and guidelines available to follow; therefore, it was very difficult to diagnose the problem and identify the possible solutions. For purposes of its *ex ante* valuation, the Respondent did not lower the OSF or its projections of CCO production as a result of the vibrations, because the impact of the risk was not a current reduction in productivity given the lower OSF achieved by the Project.\n\nFiguera Appendix 71.\n\n474.\n\nThe Claimants contend that after the nationalization, the Project did nothing to address the risk associated with the vibrations. But the issue has always been recognized as a very complex one. Foster Wheeler described the problem as representing a high potential threat on personal safety. The vibration problem at the coker unit has always been tackled with diligence, but the difficulty lies in its uniqueness and the lack of a known solution. The Vibration Mitigation Project Team created in 2005 was led by the Chevron Energy Technology Company (CETC). The 2013 CETC Report details the efforts that had been made prior to 2012. This Report is the latest in a series of proposals to remedy a situation for which no known solution exists. The CETC Report states that it is not enough to modify the existing structure only, but that it would be necessary to enforce strict control on feed rates. CETC included in its proposed solution the construction of shear walls following the installation of braces. The 2014 approval to proceed with the most recent solution proposed by CETC was justified by the risk to personal safety and contamination by toxic releases. The Respondent's experts have attempted to quantify the reduction in value. They adopted a 10% cessation risk, reducing the value of Claimants' interest in the Hamaca Project from US$ 315 million to US$ 270 million. The Claimants' experts have not suggested any alternative valuation, denying any solution in arguing that the coker vibration is not presently impacting syncrude production at PetroPiar and thus that there could not be an impact on valuation.\n\n*4. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\n475.\n\nThere is no dispute about the fact that the Petrozuata upgrader was designed for a capacity of 120,000 BPD EHCO, resulting in 104,000 BPD CCO (or, more precisely, 103,450 BPD), at a yield factor of 0.8621, and expected to operate at a 97% OSF288. The Respondent reported about deficiencies and operational problems occurring during the historical period since Mr. Figuera mentions \"equipment failures\" and \"operational errors\". It does not identify the cause of such occurrences nor does it deduct from such events any impact on future production. The evidence before the Tribunal shows that this upgrader was capable of operating at an OSF rate of 97%. It may of course become a characteristic of such a complex structure that in order to keep such high-level throughput and to improve performance, maintenance activities may increase. However, as long as this is effectively done, the effect will be on costs, while the capacity of the upgrader is kept close to the design-level.\n\nWitness Figuera noted that it was 95.9% in 2006; TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 8, p. 2107:11-2108:7. The 2006 Business Plan mentioned an adjusted reliability rate of 97.5%. The Report made in March 2012 after the 2011 turnaround showed a resulting DCO processing capacity close to the design top; Figuera Appendix 82, p. 39. The Petrozuata Annual Report to the Lenders of 1 April 2007 observed that the upgrader operated at an average uptime of 98% during 2006 (C-376, p. 3/pdf).\n\n476.\n\nThe Claimants note, however, that the average volume of EHCO supplied to the upgrader was 118,000 BPD289, corresponding to 43,070,000 MMB per year. When an OSF of 97% (of 120,000 BPD) is applied, the volumes to be retained are lower, *i.e.* for EHCO 116,400 BPD290 (42,486,000 MMB) and for CCO 100,348 BPD and 36,627,181 MMB. These amounts do not account for the impact of shutdowns required for turnarounds that were scheduled to be done every five years. However, this sequence was subject to technical, economical or other practical incidents and can therefore not be retained for a production reduction (and cost attribution) for precisely each year. Its impact on the OSF of the actual year is about 8%, resulting in a 1.6% discount to be operated per year for the purpose of calculating the upgrader capacity. Any additional shutdown period is absorbed by the overall OSF. Therefore, in respect of EHCO, the volumes to be noted are 114,480 BPD and 41,785,200 MMB, further yielding to 98,693 BPD and 36,023,021 MMB CCO.\n\nThis was the quantity of EHCO field production recorded in the Petrozuata 2006 Business Plan (LECG-082).\n\nClaimants' 2017 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 104, notes a number of 116,600, further referring to the CEM, p. 41-43, that does not provide such result.\n\n477.\n\nThe overwhelming part of the documentary record relating to the Hamaca upgrader in the years 2005 to 2007 shows OSF between the upper 80s and the lower 90s. It is not disputed that PDVSA shared all of these statements made prior to the expropriation. The Hamaca Business Plan 2006 for the ten following years reports an average 89.65% OSF for that period (C-346, p. 32), with the highest numbers in 2011 and 2013 (94.53%) and the lowest in 2008 (77.58% - a turnaround year), noting that this was in the range of the RAM IV study (p. 34). Witness Lyons affirmed that in 2006 the Project partner endorsed using 91-92% as the projected long-term OSF of the Hamaca upgrader291. In light of the evidence on the record, the Respondent's assertion that the upgrader OSF was not more than 73% since 2005 is unsupported. At least for the early years prior to the expropriation, such allegation is clearly contradicted by the available documentary evidence of that time. The Tribunal further notes that when the Respondent bases his allegation about an average 73% OFS over the years 2005 to 2015 on Mr. Figuera's statement292, it is clearly contradicted by its own witness noting OSF in the range between 74.90% and 86.25% for the years 2005 to 2008 (with an average of 80.65%) and informing the Tribunal that the OSF in 2005 was 87.6%293. In September 2010, PDVSA and its partners reported that they undertook the 2009 turnaround with the aim of restoring a \"World-Class Upgrader\"294.\n\nRebuttal [3rd] Witness Statement, 14 April 2010, para. 5; Fourth Witness Statement, 16 May 2014, para. 28; Fifth Witness Statement, 13 October 2014, para. 19. The design OSF had been set at 91% in the Hamaca's Project's Business Plan (Construction Plan) of 14 October 1998, including biannual shutdown (30 days) and unscheduled outages (18 days annually), p. 222, 234/235. The goal to be achieved was 95% (p. 224, 237). The Minutes of the Operation Committee Meeting of Hamaca of 30 November 2004 assumed an OSF of 88.4% in 2005 and a 91.5% - 92.9% in 2006 forward, except for a 87.3% OSF in turnaround years (C-201); the same numbers are shown in a Board of Directors Presentation on 2 December 2004 (C-202, p. 14/pdf). At the Hamaca Board of Directors' Meeting of 17 November 2005, it was stated that the duty cycle of the upgrader plant for the next 10 years was 91.4% (LECG-130, p. 11/pdf).\n\nThird Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, table 1, para. 8.\n\nTR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2386:3-7.\n\nFinal Report on PetroPiar's 2009 Turnaround, 21 September 2010, Figuera Appendix 76, p. 3.\n\na. The OSF allegedly based on reality\n-------------------------------------\n\n478.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the documentation on its record in relation to turnarounds that were in general scheduled every four years shows that one of the main purposes of a turnaround was to ensure maintenance and improve performance of the upgrader, an object which is generally expressed through the OSF measured before and reached at the end of a turnaround. The Parties do not share a common view about whether the turnarounds actually conducted were successful in this respect, but this does not have the effect of removing the object relating to the improvement of the OSF.\n\n479.\n\nThe Respondent insisted in the final phase of this proceeding on playing down the OSF figures retained in the few documents on turnaround it made available to the Tribunal, stating many times that in reality the OSF figures actually obtained were much lower, around 72 or 73%. Whatever may be the origin of these figures that will be discussed below, the Tribunal notes from the outset that they contradict manifestly the documentation relating to the turnarounds that had been prepared and approved by all participants, including the Respondent's company PDVSA. The Respondent submits that turnarounds have been executed and it claims the costs incurred. If the OSF in reality went down to a level of 73%, the turnaround preceding the measurement of such OSF would have been a complete failure and the costs claimed in this respect without justification. The Respondent does not make any such submission. Furthermore, it did not provide any actual testimony or further evidence of such low level OSF. On the other hand, the Claimants' usual line of argument based on PDVSA's profound deficiencies in operating the upgrader and its poor mismanagement is not more convincing, as it is not supported by actual facts and evidence.\n\n480.\n\nTurnarounds serve to improve the OSF295. The Respondent reported that after the extensive turnaround/PRAC in 2012, the OSF of the upgrader in 2013 was only 71.90%, which was slightly lower than the OSF in 2011 (72.38%)296. This assertion is most confusing in light of the 2012 Report relating to the turnaround, which has had as its main authors the representatives of PDVSA together with those of Chevron. It is hard to believe that under the direction of a high ranking director of PDVSA a Report was written indicating that the purpose of the exercise was to reach \"the goal of reliably restoring processing capacity to 247 MPD\"297, further noting that the upgrader was \"World-Class\"298, whereas the Venezuelan Government now represents before this Tribunal that this was all wrong and the correct figure had been below 72%.\n\nWitness Lyons, TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 7, p. 2088:16-2089:10.\n\nRespondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 346, p. 259.\n\nFiguera Appendix 46, 2012 Final Closing Report on the PRAC, August 2013, p. 5, 113; cf. TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 10, p. 2917/4-16 (Earnest). The volume of 247 MPB was the maximum capacity for DCO. The Respondent argued that this volume was the target, whereas the actual capacity was 190 MPB, which is noted in the PRAC Report; cf. Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, p. 259; TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4752:6-4753:19 (Preziosi). However, the Respondent did not provide evidence on the result of this PRAC; several important chapters are missing, most probably including the section reporting about the OSF obtained at the end of the restoration. The Tribunal also notes that the number of 190 MPB did not represent a low capacity or OSF of certain duration, but that the upgrader was experiencing a period of particular difficulties that called for appropriate remedy. The Report explains explicitly that the processing capacity of the complex was limited to 190 MPB \"due to mechanical damages to some critical equipment\" that are then enumerated. It is thus clear that the 190 MPB figure was of a transitory nature.\n\nA quality expressly confirmed by the Respondent's Counsel as being PDVSA's position; TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4602:21-4603:3 (Preziosi).\n\n481.\n\nA similar argument has been raised by the Respondent in respect of the 2009 turnaround, which allegedly did not improve the OSF. The evidence expected to be supplied by the Respondent is missing. The Respondent simply refers to a table prepared by Mr. Figuera that does not rely on pertinent facts, as will be explained below. The Report of the 2009 turnaround has been submitted in parts only299; the missing sections must have contained the relevant information on the verified actual OSF as this is a key information to be recorded in any such report. When questioned about the OSF resulting from the 2012 PRAC, Counsel of the Respondent admitted that this information was not contained in the parts of the concluding Report submitted to the Tribunal300, and that it may have been reported in the missing parts that they were not able to produce301. They were not able to explain the omission of this information302.\n\nFiguera Appendix 76, Final Report on PetroPiar's 2009 Turnaround, 21 September 2010.\n\nFiguera Appendix 46.\n\nTR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4604:11-4606:18 (Preziosi).\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4578:19-4580:20, 4600:3-4601:6, 4604:3-4606:18 (Preziosi). In reply to the Tribunal's query, three annexes have been supplied that relate to the preparation of the turnaround and not to its results.\n\n482.\n\nOn the same line, when the Respondent affirms that the first PREM was conducted in 2012 and the second in 2013, but that both did not improve the OSF above approximately 72%, no evidence other than a list of numbers provided by Mr. Figuera is submitted. If the matter had been taken seriously, the Respondent would have presented the necessary documentary evidence retained by PDVSA in respect of these PREMs.\n\n483.\n\nA further contradiction in the Respondent's submissions appears in relation to the OSF figures retained by the RAM studies that the Respondent presented as being overall reliable, at least during the first phase of this proceeding. The Respondent contradicts itself when it affirms on the one hand that the RAM IV Report supports an OSF of 84.26%, a percentage that is repeated many times in its submissions303, whereas the same Party then asserts that since 2005 (thus already before RAM IV had been prepared in 2006) through 2015 has been about 73%304. The RAM IV study also conflicts totally with the Respondent's allegation that the OSF usually went down after turnarounds. The study's graphs show that the reverse is correct: while the OSF is down in turnaround years, it jumps up to its peek the year thereafter, before steadily declining again when approaching the next turnaround four years later (p. 70, 77).\n\nCf. Consolidated Brief, paras. 130, 136, 138, 140, 157, 344; Post-Hearing Brief, para. 124 (where the figure is 84.38%). It may be recalled that the RAM IV study has been introduced into this proceeding by Mr. Figuera (Appendix 9) and that it is declared therein that it's \"objective is to determine the On Stream Factor (OSF)\" (p. 10).\n\nCf. Consolidated Brief, paras. 139, 305, 345-347, 362; Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 123, 126.\n\n484.\n\nThe same inconsistency is contained in Mr. Figuera's statements, however with the aggravating element that Mr. Figuera was presented to this Tribunal as a fact witness making statements based on his personal knowledge. The Tribunal noted that in his first Testimony, read together with his Appendix 31, Mr. Figuera fully supported the RAM IV study and concluded that a 84.26% OSF had to be retained as an average305. He praised this study as the most relevant of the RAM studies as it was grounded in fact and actual plant data and was designed to derive a realistic OSF upon which the Project could rely306. It was only in his Third Supplemental Testimony that Mr. Figuera started testifying that the actual OSF was as from 2009 to be recognized at an average level of 72.85% or 73% OSF. Mr. Figuera did not supply any source other than Mr. Pati\u00f1o for his statement. He told the Tribunal that he merely reported what he was told on the yearly OSF; his input was limited to calculating the averages307.\n\nThe OSF in normal years would be 87.67%, while it would become 73.50% in 45-days turnaround years and 83.83% when a catalyst change had to be operated. The First Supplemental Testimony supported a mean of 84.26% (para. 81). It further stated that the maximum potential production of CCO would be reduced from the original design of 179.6 MBD over the life of the Project to 176 MBD (para. 82). This would result in a 98% OSF.\n\nSupplemental Testimony, 26 January 2010, paras. 51, 56. Witness Figuera submitted an ABB Study explaining that \"a RAM study is an excellent quantative tool that provides the project team with numerically tanked indices and important values for a system of components\". (Appendix 23, p. 8/pdf).\n\nTR-E, February 2017 Hearing, Day 8, p. 2384:22-2385:6.\n\n485.\n\nThe Respondent continued copying Mr. Figuera's figures all along308, while still maintaining reliance on the results of the RAM IV study. While it may be a party's choice to present alternative factual settings, despite their inconsistency, the same behavior is highly problematic when adopted by a witness pretending to address the Tribunal on the basis of his personal knowledge and to tell the Tribunal the truth. Manifestly, between a 84.26% OSF and a 73% OSF, a choice must be made, because one of these figures must be wrong, if they are not both wrong.\n\nThis was done, however, only for the years 2008 to 2015 that were addressed by Mr. Figuera. The Respondent has no supporting evidence for its hypothetical numbers of OSF of around 70% for the years 2005 to 2007. To the contrary, it presented a list of lost opportunity events for the years 2006 and the first half of 2007 that results (when operating appropriate calculations) in OSFs clearly above 80% (R-308).\n\nb. The OSF based on EHCO upgraded since 2009\n--------------------------------------------\n\n486.\n\nMr. Figuera has demonstrated that the figures of EHCO he used for calculating his new OSF numbers are those related to the production of the CCO in the quantities required since 2009 when the Project started to produce and sell significant volumes of non-upgraded products, thus using the upgrader below its design capacity309. The year-by-year OSF he retained can then be compared to the corresponding quantities of CCO that had been produced and sold during the years 2009-2015:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year | OSF (Based on CCO Production) | CCO Produced310 | OSF (Based on CCO Sales) | CCO Invoices311 |\n| 2005 | 87.63 |  | 86.25 |  |\n| 2006 | 74.96 |  | 74.90 |  |\n| 2007 | 82.79 |  | 81.68 |  |\n| 2008 | 78.77 |  | 79.76 |  |\n| 2009 | 60.52 | 39,675,000 | 60.84 | 39,845,387 |\n| 2010 | 75.45 | 49,459,910 | 76.30 | 49,468,161 |\n| 2011 | 71.37 | 46,783,000 | 72.38 | 47,449,859 |\n| 2012 | 40.74 | 26,782,000 | 38.36 | 25,214,117 |\n| 2013 | 72.61 | 47,602,000 | 71.90 | 47,131,231 |\n| 2014 | 81.14 | 53,190,000 | 80.78 | 52,955,490 |\n| 2015 | 77.72 | 50,948,525 | 78.24 | 51,287,407 |\n| Average | 73 |  | 72.85 |  |\n\nThe OSF is calculated taking the design capacity of 179,600 BPD CCO, respectively 65,554,000 MMB, as 100% reference. Compared to the actual EHCO and CCO figures reported by Mr. Figuera, the percentages obtained are in the 60 to 70% range. However, this calculation has nothing to do with the efficiency of the upgrader. Mr. Figuera in fact simply compared the decrease in EHCO and resulting CCO production that occurred in the years 2009 to 2015 in relation to the design levels. His figures cannot be understood but as a consequence of the shift in production that occurred in 2009, when upgraded oil production was reduced while blended oil was sold in parallel. These figures do not demonstrate that the upgrader was no longer capable of performing a throughput in the quantities close to the design level. No evidence has been provided to the Tribunal that would address such a deficiency. Mr. Figuera does not address the question.\n\nCf. Figuera Testimony, 20 July 2009, para. 8; Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 345; Respondent's 2017 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 126.\n\nBased on Figuera, Appendix 107; Hamaca Assessment of Production, p. 15; Figuera, Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, table 1, para. 19.\n\nSubmitted by Respondent at the March 2017 Hearing, with corrections for years 2009 and 2010 in Annex 7 of Respondent's Answers of July 10, 2017.\n\n487.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Figuera modified the parameters applicable to the OSF metric actually applicable when the Association Agreements were still in force. He compared the quantity of CCO produced in 2009-2015 to the initial design capacity for CCO, although this capacity was no longer actual since the upgrader was operating under the new conditions with quantities of EHCO and CCO volumes far below the maximum of 190,000 BPD EHCO312. Of course, the OSF metric compares the CCO produced with the EHCO fed to the upgrader for such purpose. But when such a metric should serve to identify performance of upgrading, it makes sense exclusively when the EHCO volume remains constant: under this condition, one can compare the efficiency of the upgrader at different points in time by reference to the outgoing CCO in relation to the EHCO supplied. Therefore, when Mr. Figuera listed a 60% OSF for year 2009, he compared the actual production of CCO with the Project's initial design capacity of 190,000 BPD (69,350,000 MMB), while the proper method would have required comparing with the actual volume of EHCO used to produce such actual quantity of CCO (108,699 BPD; 39,675,000 MMB) the same year.\n\nReferring to Mr. Figuera's percentages of OSF, Mr. Earnest observed that there has been a marked fall off in the operating proficiencies post-expropriation; TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 10, p. 2921:13-2922:4.\n\n488.\n\nThe confusion can also be shown when observing that Mr. Figuera's presentation does not allow the taking into account of the conclusions of the RAM IV study, which he approved, in a range around 85% OSF. This percentage is exclusively based on the capacity of the upgrader to produce CCO when provided with the design EHCO quantity. Mr. Figuera (as well as Mr. Pati\u00f1o before him) does not take account of this key element in determining the upgrader's capacity. He refers exclusively to a reduced volume of EHCO and calculates its impact on OSF, and then accounts for an out coming quantity of CCO as if the upgrader would work on a 100% OSF.\n\nc. The OSF based on the RAM IV study\n------------------------------------\n\n489.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the RAM I, II and III studies are of very limited relevance in light of the fact that they were prepared when the Hamaca upgrader was not yet in operation. The RAM IV study - dated June 2006 - was made on the basis of full knowledge of the operational terms of the upgrader and covers a period of 20 years. It made extensive reference to the RAM III report that it revised and updated. As RAM IV is the more recent of all four studies and the broadest in scope, its conclusions must prevail over those made previously.\n\n490.\n\nThe RAM IV study presented three scenarios, each of them being divided into two variants (A and B). Scenario 1A represents \"the most representative of the upgrader current condition\". It includes the heat exchanger failure rate and the failure rates of all pumps set to 4 years (No. 3.3.2.1). The resulting OSF is a distributed value with a mean of 84,386%, with a standard deviation of 0.63%. Scenario 2A includes improvement opportunities, based on available failure and repair data taken from the best practices considered at world-wide level (No. 3.3.2.2). The resultant OSF is 87,872% with a standard deviation of 0,493%. Compared to Scenario 1A, the OSF for Scenario 2A is higher by 3,486%. Scenario 3A includes a metallurgic change of exchangers (No. 3.3.2.3) and results in an OSF of 86,316%, together with a standard deviation of 0,583%.\n\n491.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the OSF used by the authors of the RAM IV study includes consideration of the impact of the maintenance plan of all process units, including turnarounds undertaken every four years (p. 67, 71, 77, 120). The figures resulting for each scenario incorporate the turnarounds in the annual percentages and in the cumulative average at the end of the 20-year period.\n\n492.\n\nAll of these variants A have been combined with a variant B, representing a correction for upstream failures (described as \"external factors\" and \"support facilities\" [page 79]) in an approximate percentage of 2.1% to be added to each of the three scenarios. The Respondent applies this B-reduction and advocates in its main presentation an OSF of 84.26%, which represents Scenario 3B, including changes in metallurgy, but reducing the OSF in light of upstream failures counting for approximately 2.1%.\n\n493.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this latter reduction is not correct when considering the OSF as strictly related to the upgrader's production capacity. As the OSF serves to determine the capacity of producing CCO compared to the quantity of EHCO separated from DCO, such a factor based on failures occurring in the supply chain of DCO delivered at the upgrader (pipelines, wells) must not be included. The OSF has always be defined and understood as a metric related specifically to the operational efficiency of the upgrader313. The RAM IV study further noted that these external factors were not under Ameriven personnel control (p. 96)314. Therefore, it cannot be suddenly used as a factor for upstream production. In any event, the Respondent does not explain its choice in any way.\n\nThis was also Mr. Figuera's understanding in his first Testimony (20 July 2009), note 39: \"The RAM IV Study also relates only to the upgrader, and does not address issues that could impact production at the oil field or the pipeline.\"\n\nMr. Earnest shared this view; TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 10, p. 2893:10-2894:6.\n\n494.\n\nWhen this upstream portion of 2.1% is set aside, the Respondent's choice is Scenario 3A, resulting in an OSF of 86,316% and a standard deviation of 0,583%. This choice does not include any improvement based on \"best-practice\" standards (Scenario 2A). The Respondent does not supply reasons for this choice. If Scenario 2A is added (+3,486%) to the base scenario, the resulting OSF becomes 87,872%, with a deviation margin of approximately 1%.\n\n495.\n\nThe Respondent has not argued directly that such improvements had not been made. It simply relied on Mr. Figuera's assertions that the OSF of the Hamaca upgrader was in constant decline, even after turnarounds. It notes that an OSF of 84.26% demonstrates that the upgrader suffered from severe problems, to such extent that the 91% OSF the Claimants use appears nothing more than an aspiration315, but it also notes that this OSF corresponds to the \"most representative\" scenario, without improvements316. The question whether such improvements were actually decided and implemented has not been addressed explicitly by the Respondent.\n\nRespondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 140.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 136.\n\n496.\n\nThis issue has to be examined more closely. The Hamaca Board of Directors meeting of 18 May 2006 recorded a current OSF of 91-92%317. The Hamaca Economic Model of 30 October 2006 shows an OSF over 93% for the whole duration of the Project (LECG-129). The Hamaca 2005 General Business Plan had as one of its premises an average OSF of 91% (C-341, p. 39). When considering the conclusions of the RAM IV Report, the Board of Directors submitting the Petrolera Ameriven 2006 business plan noted an OSF of 93.2% in 2009 under normal operations and OSFs over 91% as from 2009 except in turnaround years318. A number of improvements were made in the budget319; according to Mr. Earnest, they had the effect of raising the OSF to 92.93%320. This expert assumed that all the items that had been budgeted were ultimately made321. Witness Lyons explained that the list of corrective actions had been translated in the budgets for 2007 and 2008322. The long-term planning was based on a 91.4% OSF, while the actual operation was better than this323.\n\nFiguera Appendix 25, p. 3.\n\nCf.

The Respondent further added that \"any possible improvements targeted to improve the OSF based on international practices have in fact been implemented\". It noted that even if \"best practices\" reference figures were available324, the maximum OSF estimated and after accounting for upstream failures (Scenario 2B) would be 85.78% (p. 20). This last figure does not include the metallurgic improvements that were part of Scenario 3. Nonetheless, the Respondent did not affirm that such improvements had not been made. If they are taken into account, the resulting OSF would become higher than 85.78% (*i.e.* +1.93% under variant A).\n\nThe RAM IV study explains that its Best Practices data came from the documents supplied by Ameriven, and for the equipment with no data of Best Practices, the most optimistic available data was taken from the existent databases (p. 58). This shows that the relevant information was available to the Project's governance.\n\n498.\n\nRAM IV identifies the OSF portion that each scenario 2 and 3 would add to the basic level represented by scenario 1. The study shows that when considering the lists of equipment items to be subject for improvement, there appears a very small overlap between scenario 2 and 3325. Scenario 3 seems to address metallurgic items exclusively, while scenario 2 has a much broader scope and may not include metallurgic improvements already covered by scenario 3. Therefore, one reading of the RAM IV study would be to combine Scenario 3A (86,316%) and 2A (improvement potential of 3,486%), resulting in an OSF of 89.8%. However, there is another, possible reading326. The Study states that when the projected Scenario 3A is chosen (86,316%), including a metallurgic change of exchangers, the OSF is increased by about 2% (1.93%); it also notes that this reduces the improvement opportunities margin to 1,556% (p. 96). The Tribunal considers that since each scenario is adjusted by a deviation margin and given the improvement capacities of the Project's upgrader, which includes a metallurgic change of exchangers, an OSF of 88.5% will be retained.\n\nCf. RAM IV, p. 130 and 133. On both lists one can find two elements of the coker unit, and two items of the flare system. All other items appear on one list only.\n\nCf. Witness Figuera, Supplemental Testimony, 26 January 2010, para. 58, p. 45; Respondent's Counsel Preziosi, TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4768:15-4769:13.\n\nd. The impact of shutdowns and maintenance\n------------------------------------------\n\n499.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that a number of reports, minutes, contracts and invoices show that the coker caused a serious concern because of the vibration of its structure. The Tribunal is troubled, however, by unsupported assertions such as the Respondent's experts claiming a risk of explosion of 10% that increases in the same percentage year by year, as if a responsible operator of an upgrader would let such coker running, despite the manifest life-threatening risk for its workers and the ongoing operation of the upgrader as a whole.\n\n500.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at this juncture that the risk of failure of the coker did not materialize in a reduction of the upgrader's throughput. The issue is not part of a submission for a reduced capacity of production of the upgrader. It is a factor of costs to be considered as a potential for reduced cash flow and will have to be dealt with in this connection below.\n\n501.\n\nAny other operational handicap highlighted by the Respondent does not appear as extraordinary to the effect that it would impact on the valuation above the usual operational elements and the required maintenance, including turnarounds. This is the case of acid corrosion that is mentioned as part of the items to be revisited during turnarounds327.\n\nCf., for instance, Minutes of Hamaca Operations Committee Meeting of 8 February 2006, p. 8 (Figuera, Appendix 50); Hamaca Board of Directors Presentation of 22 February 2007, p. 7/pdf (C-379); Witness Lyons, TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2232:19-2233:11.\n\n502.\n\nThe EHCO extracted at the fields and transferred to the upgrader apparently was not of identical quality in regular terms. Lower than the expected gravity was observed. However, the Respondent does not demonstrate that this had any effect on the syncrude production. It did not observe that the contractual minimum was 8\u00b0 API328, close to the actual 7.7\u00b0 and below the alleged 8.6\u00b0 design API. It also omitted to note that the technical report on which it relied329 explains that a lower API degree of EHCO can be compensated by a higher API of the diluent naphtha and that such a measure had the effect of increasing the production level of EHCO at 2.9 MBD and of CCO at 2.7 MBD330. Witness Figuera equally omitted to consider this information331. One effect of under graded API may be on price. However, the Tribunal notes that it has not been provided with evidence on an alleged impact of variations in API gravity on the CCO production through the upgrader. The differences in API gravity that appear on the Hamaca invoices from 2009 through 2015 relate to the down-stream part of the Project and their impact on prices cannot be recognized. Moreover, the Respondent does not draw any specific conclusion from such occurrences, either in terms of production volumes or as a loss of revenue. The Tribunal also observes that the Respondent confuses API degree of the EHCO from upstream with the API degree of the syncrude (mentioned on the invoices), which are different332. In terms of valuation, the issue is moot.\n\nAnnex A to Exhibit K of the Hamaca Association Agreement (C-22, p. 786/pdf).\n\nRespondent's Final Brief on Quantum, footnote 283.\n\nPetrolera Ameriven Technical Note (Processing of Extra Heavy Crude Oil (EHCO) of Low API Gravity, 11 July 2007 (C-405), p. 9, 15.\n\nCf. Supplemental Testimony, 26 January 2010, paras. 66-72; Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 22.\n\nCf. the Respondent's Answers of 10 July 2017 and its Reply of 31 July 2017 (Question 10), where numerous documents containing piles of invoices are mentioned (like Figuera Appendices 42, 104), without any indication where excessively low API could be found. The Claimants noted correctly in their comments of 31 July 2017 (para. 33) that the Respondent had not cited evidence of a causal connection between alleged EHCO quality issues and the supposed decline in syncrude quality (and thus the price).\n\n503.\n\nThe collapse of storage tank 12 is not an issue, and has not been presented by the Respondent as an issue impacting on the efficient production of the upgrader. The operator has dealt with the problem (one solution providing for by-pass), and the matter remaining in dispute in this respect relates to costs and not to the valuation of the capacity for production of the upgrader.\n\n504.\n\nThe Respondent complained about a number of factors having allegedly an impact on the performance of the upgrader and the quality of the CCO produced, like a less favorable chemical composition of the EHCO and corrosion problems. However, the Respondent does not take these into account when assessing the valuation and production capacity of the upgrader. The problems that are mentioned may have a potential impact on the performance of the upgrader and are to be treated through appropriate maintenance; this has been done, as this can be easily observed when consulting the reports made on turnarounds. The costs have thus been absorbed by the budget allocation for turnarounds and other maintenance activities. The Respondent does not allege specific shutdowns caused by such problems, nor did it show that such shutdowns would have had the effect of reducing the OSF below 90%. The same is true in respect of the sulfur issue that the Respondent admittedly considers as to be addressed by means of upgraded metallurgy, thus increasing costs. Metallurgy has been a permanent item on turnarounds and has been highlighted already by the RAM studies as a maintenance issue typical for upgraders333.\n\nCf. Witness Lyons, Fifth Witness Statement, 13 October 2014, paras. 34-36.\n\n505.\n\nMr. Figuera provided the Respondent inspiration for a much broader allegation, extending the effects of all sorts of maintenance activities during the upgrader's shutdowns for a yearly duration of several months. Mr. Figuera affirmed that the upgrader had suffered shutdowns of an average duration of 85 days each year from 2009 to 2012334. He did not refer to any personal experience in this respect, nor did he present any other evidence335. The Respondent reproduced Mr. Figuera's testimony and, when questioned, supplied it with a long list of documents filed by Mr. Figuera that he did not use himself in support of his assertion336. This was for good reasons, because none of the documents cited by the Respondent offers evidence for shutdowns of such duration as alleged. Out of 22 documents, only two of them mention the occurrence of shutdowns of short duration337. The Respondent did not compare these documents and its allegation with the results of the RAM IV study that had as one of its specific objectives to \"predict most of the scenarios of shutdowns\" (p. 11, 14).\n\nFiguera, Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 11.\n\nThe Development Production Supply Agreement (Exhibit K to the Hamaca Association Agreement) provided, among others, that any participant shall promptly give to the other a notice of any unscheduled shutdown (Art. 5.3). No such notice has been included into the Tribunal's record.\n\nRespondent's Reply of 31 July 2017, Question 13, p. 31/32.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the documents referred to do not contain any indication relating to a shutdown (cf. Figuera Appendix Nos 24, 33, 46, 49, 53-55, 58, 60, 62, 65-67, 119, 120, 123). Appendix No. 25 expressly stated that an \"unplanned shutdown has been avoided\" (p. 5-6). In one document, a shutdown of short duration was noted (Appendix No. 32), while in another report it was mentioned that a shutdown occurred three times, however without indicating its duration (Appendix No. 131), while in another Appendix it was observed that reparation on the same item (tank 12) was made when it was out of service (Appendix No. 61).\n\n506.\n\nFor Mr. Figuera's statement on the long duration of shutdowns, his Appendix 73 serves as the sole and exclusive basis of evidence. It has to be remembered that the designed maximum CCO capacity was 179,600 BPD, corresponding to 100% OSF. Therefore, 1% OSF is 1796 BPD. The same way, negative OSF can be calculated: a loss of 1796 BPD equals a loss of 1% OSF. This defines the unavailability of the upgrader in terms of OSF (column 5) and the corresponding percentage of availability (column 6).\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Mr. Figuera's additions338 | MBls per day (divide by 365) | BPD | Unavailability (divide by 1796) (= loss of OSF) | OSF |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2008 | 7,997 | 21,910 | 21,910 | 12,199 | 87,801 |\n| 2009 | 2,755 | 7,548 | 7,548 | 4,203 | 95,797 |\n| 2010 | 5,148 | 14,104 | 14,104 | 7,853 | 92,147 |\n| 2011 | 8,642 | 23,677 | 23,677 | 13,183 | 86,817 |\n| 2012 | 11,333 | 31,049 | 31,049 | 17,288 | 82,712 |\n| 2013 | 6,505 | 17,822 | 17,822 | 9,923 | 90,077 |\n| Average |  |  |  |  | 89,225 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n\nThird Supplemental Testimony, para. 47.\n\n507.\n\nThe resulting average OSF of 89.2% has nothing in common with the average of the 73% determined by Mr. Figuera and emphasized by the Respondent. The 89,2% OSF confirms that the actual range of OSF based on production was around 90%.\n\n508.\n\nTherefore, all of Mr. Figuera's OSF indications as from 2009 and the numbers copied from him by the Respondent and its valuation experts are not correct. The Respondent's alternative position relying on the RAM IV study is more convincing, however only when adding the correction relating to best practice improvements that have been implemented and after subtraction of 2.1% related to upstream failure items that are not caused by the upgrader, together with an adjustment based on the deviation factors, resulting in an OSF of 88.5%.\n\n509.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that each scenario presented in the RAM IV study included consideration of the impact of turnarounds and other maintenance causing shutdowns on the OSF. The OSF figures retained by the Study include those shutdowns in the annual accounts and in the cumulative average OSF determined at the end of a 20-year period. Therefore, the OSF retained as a result of the combination of Scenario 2A and 3A is 88.5 %. The Tribunal adopts this OSF and the resulting quantities of 168,150 BPD and 61,374,750 MMB EHCO that yield to 159,238 BPD and 58,121,888 MMB CCO.\n\ne. The pre-expropriation OSF of 91%\n-----------------------------------\n\n510.\n\nThe Tribunal has mentioned above an impressive number of documents, mostly prior to the expropriation, that allow the conclusion that the Claimants' focus on an 91% OSF finds strong support in the Project's history339.\n\nCf. also ConocoPhillips, Hamaca RCAT Review, Engineering, 7 May 2007, p. 31/pdf, projecting full capacity rate for Hamaca's upgrader until 2033.\n\n511.\n\nHowever, the 91% OSF figure has the handicap of having never been tested as such. The Claimants further rely on the opinion of their valuation experts, who have limited experience in the technicalities of oil upgraders and did not refer to actual measuring. The Tribunal also notes that the Claimants adopt correctly a significantly lower OSF in turnaround years and they further reduce the OSF when the catalyst has to be changed340.\n\nIn fact, the Claimants demonstrative provided at the 19-21 September 2007 Hearing (\"Claimants' Position on CCO Production and OSF at Hamaca In But-For Scenario\") confirms this assessment. TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4737:18-4738:8 (King).\n\n512.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants' figure of 91% OSF (with the reductions mentioned) includes more hypothetical elements than the 88.5% OSF resulting in the Tribunal's view from the correct understanding of the RAM IV study, which includes the impact of turnarounds. The Tribunal has not been provided with any evidence that would allow an assumption that the Project, when conducted under the operational parameters based on the Association Agreement, would have deviated significantly from such an OSF, when it were to be adjusted and may be corrected within a reasonable timeframe through professional and appropriate improvements by way of maintenance and increased quality of equipment.\n\nF. Overall Production and Sales at Petrozuata and Hamaca\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n513.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal assembles the information for the assessment of the quantities of EHCO and CCO production, either in actual terms or on the basis of the evidence that allows determining production as it would have occurred if the Association Agreements had remained in place. The first period with actual results covers mid-2007 and 2008. The Tribunal is of the view that the quantities of EHCO produced at that time on the fields and supplied to the upgrader, together with the outgoing CCO, confirm basically the efficiency of the upgraders when operated under the control of PDVSA but before the cut in supply adopted for the years starting in 2009. As the Respondent confirms, this relatively short period under PDVSA' direction comes close to what the Claimants experienced prior to the expropriation:\n\nIn the post-nationalization period pre-dating January 1, 2009, the mixed companies produced and sold only CCO and, accordingly, the actual performance in that period represents what the performance would most likely have been had the associations remained in place341.\n\nRespondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 317.\n\n514.\n\nAs from 2009, due to the change in the operational mode of the Projects and the production and sale of blended oil, the actual figures are not representative for the production and sales that would have been made had the Claimants remained partners in the Projects. Therefore, as from that date, the relevant figures are collected on the basis of the available quantities of EHCO for both the production of CCO and blended oil, combined with the production parameters of the upgraders. This applies to the historical period between 2009 and 2016 and for the following years. As this has been explained above, the Tribunal applies to the mean OSF retained for the Petrozuata Project a reduction of an average 1.6% corresponding to the impact of turnarounds undertaken approximately every five years (resulting in 95,4% OSF).\n\n515.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal retains, for Petrozuata, a EHCO production capacity of 41,785,200 MMB per year (equal to 114,480 BPD), and for Hamaca 61,374,750 MMB (168,150 BPD). In combination with the respective yields for Petrozuata (0.8621) and Hamaca (0,947), the resulting quantities of CCO are 36,023,021 MMB (98,693 BPD) for Petrozuata and 58,121,888 MMB (159,238 BPD) for Hamaca. The Tribunal further finds that these amounts also apply for the following years of the future lifetime of the Projects, as long as they would have been operating under the conditions provided for in the Association Agreements.\n\n516.\n\nAs this has been explained above (part B), the volume of CCO production must be slightly adjusted in order to take account of the volume of EHCO by-pass during turnarounds. Such volume represents a loss of upgraded oil and revenue for these periods of limited duration. The quantities of EHCO to be considered are relatively small, in an extent that does not allow useful results if the volumes involved would be attributed to years when turnarounds took place, assuming that these years could be determined with some precision - which is not the case. Therefore, the Tribunal retains the total amount of EHCO by-pass of 9,044,000 MMB for Petrozuata and of 20,880,000 MMB for Hamaca over the life-time of the respective Projects. For the purpose of adequate accounting of the values involved, these figures are to be taken into account in their proportion of 30% compared to the price of CCO counted at 100%, leaving 2,713,200 MMB for Petrozuata and 6,264,000 MMB for Hamaca. Instead of distributing these numbers over years when turnarounds took place, the Tribunal retains an average over the lifetime of each of the Projects since 2009, resulting in 193,800 MMB for Petrozuata and 261,000 MMB for Hamaca. The Tribunal also recognizes a small margin of discretion that allows rounding and retains a total production of heavy syncrude per year for Petrozuata of 36,200,000 MMB CCO, and 58,400,000 MMB CCO for Hamaca.\n\n517.\n\nIn relation to the period approaching the term of the lifetime of each of the Projects, the Tribunal observes that the Parties are not as explicit as they are in respect of many other items. For Petrozuata, the Claimants stated claims for production until the end of the Association Agreement's term in 2036342, but they also accept, based on their experts' assessment343 and on Witness Lyons344, that the productivity of the field will dramatically decline at the end of year 2023. This turndown point also appears in the models that have been used345. The Tribunal finds therefore that operation at design capacity will no longer be the Project's target beyond 2023. For Hamaca, the Claimants also include in their claim the terminal year 2037346. The drop-off term is closer to the end of the lifetime of the Project, when in 2034 the curve of production turns definitively down-wards347.\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, paras. 179, 180, 224. No blended oil was produced during that period; cf. Figuera, Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, para. 21, footnote 46.\n\nCf. Claimants' Tables on Production at Petrozuata submitted on 20 March 2017; Abdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 50; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 12, p. 3455:13-3456:18 (Abdala). See also ConocoPhillips RCAT group, Building Production Capacity Reserves, October 2006 (C-474). The Petrozuata Annual Management Report to Lenders of 1 April 2007 (C-376) noted under \"Further Risks Associated with Long-Range Plan Key Assumptions\" that \"with access to the Reserve Area, the production falls below 120,000 BPCD in 2023\".\n\nRebuttal [3rd] Witness Statement, 14 April 2010, paras. 3, 12; TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 4, p. 1102:12-20. At the February 2017 Hearing, Witness Lyons noted that decline was expected in the 2006 Business Plan in year 2027 (TR-E, Day 8, p. 2209:12-21), but he also accepted a reference to 2023 (TR-E, Day 7, p. 1955:5-9). Witness Figuera also referred to year 2023 (Supplemental Testimony, 26 January 2010, para. 30).\n\nCf. Composite Economic Model (CEM; LECG-085), p. 15, 42/pdf.\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, paras. 226, 271, 309.\n\nThe Claimants' experts (Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 54) note a decline starting in 2031. The 2006 Business Plan noted a decline in 2032, when well targets will run out in 2031 (C-346, LECG-112, p. 20); cf. Witness Lyons, TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 7, p. 2012:20-2013:17. The Tribunal observes that while it is correct that the curve shows downwards from that year, the clear trend is manifest as from 2034 only. Cf. Claimants' Tables on Production at Hamaca, filed on 20 March 2017; ConocoPhillips, Hamaca RCAT Review, Engineering, 7 May 2007, p. 15, 27, 31/pdf.\n\n518.\n\nAfter the drop-off years 2024 and 2034 respectively, production may still continue, albeit with much lower quantities. The available volumes until the end of the concessions' lifetime are difficult to ascertain on a reasonably certain basis. The numbers provided by the experts are not supported by testimony or actual documentary evidence. Further, the ratio between the revenue resulting from such end-term production and the costs that will be still involved at a more or less similar level than before will run out of proportion at a certain point in time for reasons of economics and financing. Drilling will no longer be an option when the costs cannot be recovered348. The Tribunal finds that for Hamaca, the drop in productivity was substantial in 2034, close to the contractual end of the Project. However, this is not a sufficient reason to stop the accounting completely while the production is still above 50% of the average determined by the Tribunal (61,374,750 MMB). The Tribunal retains therefore for Hamaca, keeping the calculation simple, the amounts of 51,000,000 (2034), 47,000,000 (2035) and 43,000,000 (2036). For Petrozuata, the main cliff occurs as early as in 2024, more than 10 years before the definitive end; during this residual period, the production as projected is not negligible349. The Tribunal finds that this situation has also to be adequately considered and valued. It thus concludes that the production in the years 2024, 2025 and 2026 has to be included in the account for Petrozuata, as the respective amounts of EHCO are still above 50% of the average determined by the Tribunal (41,785,200 MMB). The Tribunal retains therefore the amounts of 26,600,000, 22,100,000, and 19,000,000 MMB CCO for the years 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nCf. Witness Lyons, TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 7, p. 1905:20-1907:10.\n\nThe pertinent figures are provided by the CEM, p. 42/pdf, and the Claimants' Tables submitted on 20 March 2017.\n\n519.\n\nOn the basis of the reasons provided above, the overall figures for production at Petrozuata and Hamaca are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Capacity | EHCO to upgrader | CCO | Total CCO |\n|  |  | BPD | MMB | BPD | MMB | years | MMB |\n| Petrozuata 2007/2008 |  |  | 60,929,932 |  | 51,269,497 | 1/ | 51,269,497 |\n| Petrozuata 2009-2023 | Design | 120,000 | 43,800,000 | 103,450 | 37,759,980 |  |  |\n|  | Tribunal | 114,480 | 41,785,200 | 98,693 | 36,200,000 | 14 | 506,800,000 |\n| 2024-2026 |  |  |  |  |  | 3 | 67,700,000 |\n| Hamaca 2007/2008 |  |  | 89,682,897 |  | 81,369,878 | 1/ | 81,369,878 |\n| Hamaca 2009-2033 | Design | 190,000 | 69,350,000 | 179,600 | 65,554,000 |  |  |\n|  | Tribunal | 168,150 | 61,374,750 | 159,238 | 58,400,000 | 24 | 1,401,160,000 |\n| 2034-2036 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 141,000,000 |\n| Total |  |  |  |  |  |  | 2,249,229,375 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n\nG. Corocoro\n-----------\n\n520.\n\nIt has been mentioned above that Corocoro deserves a special section, due to the specificities of its nature and operation, different from Petrozuata and Hamaca. Corocoro did not produce upgraded oil. It also relied on an Association Agreement, concluded on 10 July 1996, but this document did not include compensation provisions (C-23, R-29). This Project is also different in the sense that Conoco Venezuela B.V. was designated as the operator for the whole 39-year duration of the Project350. Conoco Venezuela B.V. later had its ownership interest transferred to ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. (CGP). It held 32.2075% in the Project, alongside with CVP, a PDVSA subsidiary (35%), Eni (25.8%) and two smaller investors, OPIC and Ineparia (7%).\n\nCf. C-17, C-17A, R-29.\n\n521.\n\nThe Project was at the beginning of its operation in the summer of 2007 based on an amended Development Plan issued on 3 March 2005 (C-181) that projected production of 30,000 BPD of light and medium crude oil in the offshore New Areas in the Gulf of Paria. Production was estimated to rise to 70,000 BPD when the Central Production Facility (CPF) came online at an expected date in late 2008. Production did not take place prior to ConocoPhillips' handover of the operatorship of the Project to PDVSA on 1 May 2007351, followed by the formal expropriation on 26 June 2007.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and the Merits (\"the 2013 Decision\"), para. 167.\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n522.\n\nOn 8 April 2003, the Development Plan for Corocoro (C-184) was approved by CVP and the other members of the Project's Control Committee, which included representatives of the Ministry. Over the course of the next two years, substantial investments were made by the project participants, including (a) a wellhead platform; (b) an Interim Production Facility (IPF); (c) a floating storage and offloading vessel; and (d) a series of underwater pipelines connecting these facilities. By the time the Project was expropriated, the Corocoro Project was close to enter into profitable, commercial production.\n\n523.\n\nThe Claimants assert that their case on Corocoro production volumes is overwhelmingly confirmed by the contemporaneous evidence. Their experts project the recovery of 205 million barrels of oil over the period 2007 to 2021. They started with the production profile contained in ConocoPhillips's Composite Economic Model (CEM; LECG-085) for Corocoro, as updated in late 2006 and endorsed by PDVSA at that time; they then revised that profile to be consistent with ConocoPhillips's slightly lower Reserves figure for the Project (at 205 million barrels).\n\n524.\n\nThe pre-expropriation business planning documents support the Claimants' experts' production profile. The Project participants agreed to the Corocoro Development Plan Addendum (DPA) in March 2005 (C-181). It was approved by the Ministry that same month (C-210). The Claimants and PDVSA anticipated the recovery of 231 million barrels of oil during Phase I of the Project. The Claimants' experts have nevertheless relied on the more conservative production figure of 205 million barrels derived from the Claimants' assumption of the available Reserves that did comply with the SEC requirements. According to the Development Plan Addendum, a further 215 million barrels of oil would be recovered during Phase II of the Projects, plus another 200 million barrels thereafter based on an expected extension to Phase II. The Claimants' experts have excluded these additional volumes.\n\n525.\n\nThe Claimants and Venezuela do not differ widely on the ultimate volume of oil to be produced at Corocoro. The Respondent's experts project a total recovery of approximately 181 million barrels that is nearly 10% less than the Claimants. The Claimants' profile is supported by PDVSA's Proved Reserves figure for the Project and therefore must be preferred.\n\n526.\n\nThe most substantial dispute between the Parties relates to the rate at which Corocoro's wells will produce that oil. Based on the Development Plan Addendum, Abdala&Spiller assume a maximum production output of nearly 70,000 BPD by 2013, with production then decreasing until 2021. Brailovsky&Flores assume a maximum production level of only about 37,000 BPD, but over a longer period of time, ending in 2032. Venezuela assumes a slower extraction of crude based on the alleged post-expropriation performance of the Project. However, this is the result of the implementation of a different oil extraction strategy by the post-expropriation Project, known as PetroSucre.\n\n527.\n\nThe Respondent's expert Mr. Pati\u00f1o argues that the production plan set out in the Development Plan Addendum is premised on a misunderstanding of the geology of the Corocoro field, which has turned out to be less favorable than all of the Project participants had understood prior to the expropriation. Eni's models show that the production profile adopted in the Development Plan Addendum is unachievable. However, Dr. Strickland explains that the differences are not as substantial. The geological models produced by ConocoPhillips and by Eni have many similarities; their differences cannot explain the difference in production levels argued between the parties. In any event, Eni's understanding of the fields suggests rather a more recoverable oil field than the participants had thought in 2007.\n\n528.\n\nDr. Strickland explains that the new *empresa mixta,* PetroSucre, has deviated from the preexpropriation Project participants' plan to use significant volumes of water injection to increase the productivity of the wells. PetroSucre is injecting far lesser quantities of water into the reservoir. Water injection is a means of ensuring sufficient pressure in a reservoir to achieve desired production levels. PetroSucre's reduced water injection program and corresponding oil production rates can be compared to the pre-expropriation plan for Corocoro that the Claimants, as the operator of the Project, would have applied. In a departure from what had been agreed in the Development Plan Addendum, the amount of water actually injected has been less than the volume of oil extracted, meaning that the new operator is not fully replacing the lost pressure caused by the extraction of oil. This operational decision by PetroSucre represents a substantial deviation from the course that ConocoPhillips would have pursued at Corocoro. The lower production levels achieved with the reduced levels of water injection cannot be attributed to the Claimants.\n\n529.\n\nThe Corocoro Project was to begin processing its oil production at an Interim Production Facility (IPF), which would have the capacity to process 30,000-35,000 BPD. The IPF would operate pending the construction of the Central Production Facility (CPF), which would have the capacity to process 70,000-75,000 BPD of crude. While the original plan was to de-commission the IPF once the CPF was operational, the PDVSA shareholder, CVP, believed that the volume of production from the field would justify keeping them both online. At the time of the taking, the Corocoro Project was on the verge of commencing production. The IPF was scheduled to be operational in the summer of 2007, with the CPF following in late 2008. Venezuela states that the IPF in fact entered into service only in January 2008, and the CPF in February 2012, and that these delays were attributable to the Claimants.\n\n530.\n\nThe Claimants also explain that the Nationalization Decree was announced in February 2007, less than six months prior to Corocoro's expected production start, when ConocoPhillips had already dedicated nearly five years to developing the Project. The Decree required that the control of the Project be assumed by a PDVSA-controlled Transition Committee within one month's time, and that PDVSA assume full operational control by 1 May 2007. The evidence shows that Venezuela paid little heed to managing the Corocoro transition. PDVSA rarely called Transition Committee meetings and showed disorganization. PDVSA's mismanagement delayed the Project's progress, but Venezuela now seeks to attribute the delays to ConocoPhillips. While it is true that ConocoPhillips recommended additional safety measures to ensure that the IPF could withstand a \"100 year storm\", this would not have added time to the completion date or, at most, four months.\n\n531.\n\nConocoPhillips placed various options for modifying the IPF before the Transition Committee in April 2007, but to no avail. No action was taken. The IPF was completed by the manufacturer in August 2007 and, if diligently handled, would have started production three weeks later. In fact, production started in January 2008 only. All delivery delays to which Venezuela's Witness, Mr. Marcano, now points, relate to contractual deadlines falling after the 1 May transfer, when PDVSA was responsible for contract management. Relying on Mr. Marcano, Venezuela submits that the Project was significantly behind schedule in May 2007. The presentation slides referred to do not discuss details, and Mr. Marcano was not present at those meetings.\n\n532.\n\nVenezuela relies upon hearsay testimony taken from the unrelated *Universal Compression v. Venezuela* arbitration352, arguing that the CPF would have been delayed regardless of the unlawful taking. No weight can be given to such material. The Tribunal should trust the testimony of Witness Chamberlain, to the effect that, at the time of the taking, the construction of the CPF was on schedule, and that it should have been delivered by the end of 2008353. Venezuela disregards its own delays. The CPF was delayed by more than three years under PDVSA's post-expropriation management of the Project. The CPF was on track for first production by late August 2008. In sum, the alleged delays to the Corocoro production facilities cannot be attributed to the Claimants and must be disregarded for purposes of the but-for quantum calculation. The CPF was on schedule as of the expropriation date. Likewise, the alleged delays to the CPF arose after the expropriation and under PDVSA's management, to which they are properly attributable.\n\n*Universal Compression International Holdings, S.L.U. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela Respondent*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/9, Order Suspending the Proceeding (R-553).\n\nWitness Statement, 30 October 2009, para. 23.\n\n533.\n\nThe Claimants use again the same production forecast for its date-of-expropriation valuation for Corocoro. That forecast foresees the recovery of 205 million barrels of oil over the period 2007 to 2021. The Respondent's experts rely in this regard on the forecasts contained in Mr. Figuera's July 2009 witness statement. On this basis, the total volume in the forecast is 182.8 million barrels; Mr. Figuera projects lower production rates. While the Claimants' experts, relying on the Development Plan Addendum, project daily production rising to approximately 70,000 BPD, the Respondent's experts limit production to a maximum of 52,800 barrels per day, and, in most years, less than 45,000 BPD. There is no dispute that as of the time of the taking, all Project participants had agreed to pursue the oil production plan in the Development Plan Addendum. They collectively endorsed a strategy of injecting significantly more water than the oil produced. Any valuation made as of 2007 should take care of this. Venezuela assumes in its 2007 valuations for Corocoro that production would begin at the IPF in January 2008, at a rate of 19,800 BPD in 2008 and 32,300 BPD in 2009, and that full production with the CPF would not be underway until January 2010. However, at the time of the taking, the IPF was scheduled to start production in July or August 2007, and the CPF was scheduled to begin production in late 2008. Any delays to the completion of the IPF and CPF are attributable to Venezuela's and PDVSA's own shortcomings.\n\n*2. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n534.\n\nThe Respondent offers an extensive historical overview about the origin of the Corocoro Project that is, in its view, useful to understand the delays that have been characteristic for this site and the low production profile. Unlike at Petrozuata and Hamaca, ConocoPhillips was the operator of the Corocoro Project prior to the nationalization and therefore had a larger degree of responsibility for what happened during that period.\n\n535.\n\nIn the first phase of the development of the Corocoro Project, ConocoPhillips proposed a total of 24 wells, for a production estimated at 250 million barrels of oil. The 2002 Corocoro Development Plan contemplated infrastructure including a single 24-well wellhead platform in the eastern part of the field, a floating production unit (FPU) and a floating storage and offloading system (FSO), at a total cost of US$ 557 million (in 2002 US dollars). Oil production was expected to commence in late 2004 or early 2005. The Plan also provided that Conoco would undertake additional exploratory drilling in the western part of the field so that the Project would be prepared to implement Phase II in 2006.\n\n536.\n\nWithin months of the approval of the 2002 Development Plan, ConocoPhillips determined that it had underestimated the costs. Following a reassessment of the situation, a first series of delays occurred. ConocoPhillips decided to replace the floating production unit, a large vessel, with the CPF. ConocoPhillips also moved away from an engineering, procurement and construction strategy (EPC) to a new contracting strategy, whereby ConocoPhillips undertook the engineering in-house and provided that (a) the multiple components of the CPF, called \"skids\", would be farmed out to numerous contractors, including Venezuelan firms, and (b) the components would be integrated pursuant to a separate contract. This new contracting strategy was spelled out in the 2005 Corocoro Development Plan Addendum (C-181).\n\n537.\n\nThis Addendum was approved in early 2005. Phase I infrastructure costs were estimated at US$ 810.3 million (in 2003 US dollars). Phase I was sub-divided in two sub-phases, IA and IB, having different well configuration. In Phase IA, 14 wells were to be drilled, and in Phase IB 10 additional wells. The Addendum contemplated a total of 14 production wells, and 10 water injection wells. The Addendum contemplated first oil in early 2007, more than two years later than had been originally projected. It was also stated that there would be an opportunity to install an Interim Production Unit in early 2006 and accelerate the first oil date. This did not happen.\n\n538.\n\nNone of the wells contemplated in Phase IA were drilled. Thus, there was no possibility of commencing production with an IPF in early 2006. This delay did not make any difference, as the delivery of the floating storage and offloading system (FSO) was delayed and no efforts had been made to contract for an IPF for delivery in early 2006. Thereafter, the schedule for the drilling of wells continued to slip; the starting date for drilling did not occur until May 2006. ConocoPhillips did not engage in any additional exploratory drilling in the western part of the field.\n\n539.\n\nWith respect to the IPF, it was projected in October 2005 that a contract would be in place by December 2005, so that the unit could be installed at the site by October 2006, and operations commence in January 2007. Further slipping of dates occurred and no contract for the IPF was ready on 26 April 2006. ConocoPhillips contracted with Hanover on 29 September 2006, and it was envisaged that early production with the IPF would begin in May 2007, when seven wells were projected to be ready for production. In March 2007, a project schedule reflected a start-up of the IPF in May 2007 (C-383). This March 2007 schedule was the last document including an \"Overall Project Schedule\" prepared by ConocoPhillips. At the same time, ConocoPhillips requested changes to the IPF, increasing costs by US$ 5.2 million354. ConocoPhillips also advised the Corocoro Transition Committee that there would be additional delays associated with the installation of gas metering equipment not included in the IPF's design.\n\nFiguera Appendix 92.\n\n540.\n\nIn the first phase of this case, the Claimants assumed production at Corocoro of 30,000 BPD for the entire second half of 2007, even though they knew that the IPF would not be ready at that time. They claim in this phase that the IPF was scheduled to start production in July or August 2007, although the IPF was nowhere in sight at the time ConocoPhillips left the Project at the end of June 2007. The Claimants submit that the construction of the IPF was completed in August 2007, but they have no other evidence than an attachment to the IPF contract dated 25 September 2006. In fact, the IPF was delivered to the site in October 2007.\n\n541.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants have ignored the entire history of the IPF, leaving the impression that everything was proceeding exactly as planned when ConocoPhillips decided against migration. The IPF was behind schedule and ConocoPhillips was introducing design changes as late as April 2007. The IPF commenced operation in January 2008. There is no basis for projecting any production prior to that date.\n\n542.\n\nThe 2005 Corocoro Development Plan Addendum projected completion of the CPF by early 2007, further providing for a short delay. That schedule was fantasy compared to ConocoPhillips' \"Overall Project Schedule\" presented in October 2005. This presentation revealed that the skids that were to comprise the CPF were scheduled to be delivered by October 2006, with production with the CPF starting in August 2008. In a 26 April 2006 presentation, ConocoPhillips exhibited a new \"Overall Project Schedule\". The new delivery date for the skids was November 2006, rather than October 2006, the slipping to the site occurring in March/April 2008. The same presentation showed that 21 of the skids were procured in seven locations in the United States, while 13 were procured from fabricators at five locations in Venezuela. ConocoPhillips was managing the engineering from its offices in Houston, until mid-2006. This appeared to be a big mistake that resulted in enormous delays. Each skid contractor was treated separately and provided with basic engineering drawings only. Detailed engineering had to be done in cooperation between each contractor and ConocoPhillips until the drawings were considered appropriate. By October 2006, ConocoPhillips reported that the skids from Venezuela were completed on an average of 64% only.\n\n543.\n\nA new presentation of the \"Overall Project Schedule\" was submitted in March 2007. Therein, ConocoPhillips separately set forth schedules for the National (Venezuelan) skids and the \"International\" (mostly US) skids. For the latter, delivery was fixed at December 2006, but it was clear in March 2007 that not all of the international skids had been delivered. For the Venezuelan skids, a delivery date by March 2007 was set forth. However, when visiting the integration yard, it was obvious that many of those skids had not been delivered by then and that there would be further substantial delay. The delays in the skid deliveries were far worse than what was reflected in the ConocoPhillips \"Overall Project Schedule\". Many of the Venezuelan skids were far behind schedule. There were also serious issues with one of the US fabricators, Williams Production Services (WPS) in Louisiana. The first skid from this fabric had been delivered in November 2006, and the others in May 2008 only.\n\n544.\n\nIn the first phase of this case, the Respondent referred to the problems presented by the poor performance of this US contractor. After the 2010 Hearing, a company called Universal Compression, having taken over the IPF contract following a merger with Hanover, brought a case against Venezuela under the Venezuela-Spain BIT seeking compensation for the 2009 nationalization of its gas compression equipment. One of the issues in the case was compensation for the expropriation of the IPF, which remained in service as of June 2009 due to delays for the CPF. One of Universal's counsels, Mr. Price, reported about the CPF being substantially behind schedule, and said that he was told by ConocoPhillips that the delay in the completion of the CPF would be for many years. The Claimants contend that Mr. Price's testimony was not reliable. They assert that the testimony of Mr. Chamberlain should be credited, recalling that the CPF was on schedule. The Respondent submits that Mr. Price had no interest in blaming anyone for the delay in the CPF. The Respondent also recalls that the Claimants insisted in having Mr. Chamberlain submit a second witness statement, which he never did.\n\n545.\n\nIn sum, it was already well known prior to the nationalization that the scheduled start-up date for the CPF would be long delayed, and there can be no doubt that the CPF was actually delayed until 2012. In light of the delays associated with both the IPF and the CPF, the production profile that the Claimants and their experts used in their *ex ante* analysis for Corocoro is untenable.\n\n546.\n\nWholly apart from this issue on delays in delivery of the IPF and the CPF, the fact is that the Corocoro Project in any event could never achieve the production levels projected by ConocoPhillips. The geology at Corocoro would never have permitted rates of 10,000-11,000 BPD per well, as ConocoPhillips originally projected in 2005. ConocoPhillips mischaracterized the field as a system of incised valleys, when in reality the field is appropriately characterized as one with fluvial channels. Consequently, the production rates were far lower than those ConocoPhillips projected, with average rates at the outset of 1,500 BPD, 4,000 BPD and 900 BPD for reservoirs 70A, 70B and 70E, respectively.\n\n547.\n\nThe Claimants have contended that higher production levels could have been expected and would have been achieved had the Project injected more water to support the pressure in the field. But ConocoPhillips always recognized that there were substantial uncertainties regarding this method. The 2002 Development Plan (LECG-139) included as one of those uncertainties the effect of \"reservoir heterogeneity on waterflooding\", where water breaks through the reservoir creating channels to the producing wells. This was considered serious by ConocoPhillips when it stated in an internal document of August 2007 that water injection should not be used as long as its benefits are not demonstrated355. In an *ex ante* context, the effects of waterflooding were at best speculative.\n\nCorocoro RCAT Review, August 2007 (LECG-50).\n\n548.\n\nThus, the information that was available as of the date of the nationalization revealed that the production profile for Corocoro in the ConocoPhillips Composite Economic Model (CEM) could not be achieved. It would have been apparent that the start-up of the IPF, with a processing capacity of about 30,000 BPD, would have been delayed until at least the end of 2007, meaning that there would be no production in 2007; that the start-up of the CPF, with its greater level of processing capacity would be delayed for a number of years; and that in any event, the field could not achieve the levels of production contemplated by the 2005 Corocoro Development Plan Addendum with the infrastructure that was in place in light of the quality of the field. A reasonable buyer taking into account all of the available information as of 26 June 2007, would have projected far lower production volumes, consistent with the volumes set forth by Mr. Figuera's testimony.\n\n549.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the crude oil production at Corocoro during the postnationalization period has been far lower than both the volumes that had been projected in the prenationalization models upon which the Claimants rely and the volumes assumed by the Respondent in its *ex ante* assessment.\n\n550.\n\nIn their *ex post* analysis of production volumes at Corocoro, the Claimants assume again that the pre-nationalization planning document was correct in all respects. So, they make no adjustments to production volumes or costs (other than in respect of inflation). The Claimants' continued reliance on the 2005 Corocoro Development Plan Addendum as a basis for their *ex post* production profile is entirely unwarranted, as actual production has revealed that even the production volumes that Mr. Figuera projected in the first phase of this case were overly optimistic.\n\n551.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the differences in geological interpretations of the field by ConocoPhillips and Eni are not that significant because the ultimate production under both interpretations is about the same. As shown by Mr. Pati\u00f1o, the difference is of critical importance to the production levels actually achieved in the historical period as well as the overall production profile. There is a significant difference in value between (a) a project capable of producing oil at a rate of approximately 70,000 BPD that recovers 205 million barrels in a 15-year period, and (b) a project capable of achieving peak production of only about 40,000 BPD that recovers 184 million barrels over a 25-year period.\n\n552.\n\nThe fact that PetroSucre had injected lesser volumes of water than what was provided for in the development plans has had minimal impact. It has been the result of geological factors and the limitations of the surface facilities planned by ConocoPhillips. In many parts of the field, large volumes of water did not in fact have the pressure that had been required, waterflooding was much more difficult to manage and the surface facilities had limited capacities to treat the produced water. Seven years of production history at Corocoro have revealed that ConocoPhillips was wrong about most things in the field, including the appropriateness and effectiveness of a massive water injection program. In sum, in the *ex post* analysis, taking into account not only actual production in the historical period, but also what has been learned about the field, the Respondent's experts have relied on the production estimates based on PetroSucre's 2013 Reservoir Model.\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the explanations provided in respect of the pre-expropriation history of the Corocoro Project. Witness Lyons blamed the PDVSA-lead Transition Committee for not having acted expeditiously in order to have the IPF in place in August 2007356. However, the Tribunal understands that this information is of limited relevance for its task to determine the consequences of the expropriation that took effect on 26 June 2007. At that time, the Project had already accumulated delays that do not have to be analyzed here. The Parties may debate a number of contractual dysfunctions that certainly occurred but that are not for this Tribunal to decide. While the dates recorded for the entry into operation of the IPF are not always identical, January 2008 seems to be correct, as this date can be found in the statements of both Parties357. Therefore, no production has to be accounted for in 2007.\n\nFifth Witness Statement, 13 October 2014, paras. 58-64.\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 295, 304; Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 174. Witness Figuera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, para. 58; Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 110. Witness Chamberlain, Statement, 30 October 2009, para. 23.\n\n554.\n\nThe start-up of the CPF was seriously delayed. While the precise date of its availability is disputed, oil production between January 2008 and this availability was based exclusively on the output of the IPF. Albeit submitted together with different lines of argument, both Parties take the daily production of 30,000 BPD as the bottom level358, at least as from the year 2009. In order to achieve significantly higher production, the operation of the CPF was required. In other words, such higher production levels were initially scheduled starting at the end of 2008, but in fact deferred to February 2012 when the CPF was finally put in place359.\n\nSee also Witness Figuera, TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 8, p. 2157:9-2158:16, 2279:10-22; TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2446:12-15, 2506:11-14.\n\nDate confirmed by Witness Marcano, Direct Testimony, 6 January 2015, para. 38; TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 10, p. 3047:15-19.\n\n555.\n\nThe Claimants blame the Respondent for the delays in the delivery of the CPF and draws as a consequence that higher than actual production levels should be assumed as from the end of 2008 when the CPF was scheduled to start operation. The Respondent with Witness Marcano360 complains about deficient handling by ConocoPhillips of the construction and delivery of the CPF. The Tribunal's task is not to explain the contractual liabilities to be assumed by one side or the other, but to determine whether it was reasonably certain that the delay in the delivery of the CPF would occur and therefore as well the point when higher volumes of oil production could be expected. The answer results from the Project's partners experiences made already in the years 2006 and 2007 when delays in the deliveries of parts (\"skids\") to be assembled in the CPF had occurred at various times. Witness Chamberlain reported about disappointing experiences with the PDVSA's lead Transition Committee361. Further difficulties were to be expected in the near future. The ConocoPhillips partner could not be reasonably certain that the CPF would be in place at the end of 2008. Further delay was to be expected362, although the actual delivery as late as in early 2012 was not in the range of what the operator had to be aware of in 2007. However, the Tribunal cannot speculate what would have been a reasonable target at that time. It will retain the year 2012 as the beginning of the period when the operation of the CPF allowed reaching production levels above the volume that could be handled by the IPF.\n\nDirect Testimony, 6 January 2015, paras. 26-38.\n\nWitness Statement, 30 October 2009, paras. 27-40, 43-45.\n\nWitness Figuera, Supplemental Testimony, 26 January 2010, para. 120, set 90% completed delivery in January 2010.\n\n556.\n\nThe CPF had a maximum design capacity of about 70,000 BPD. The respective positions of the Parties concentrate on the question of whether this production target could be reached and, in the negative, what would be the reasonable volume to be retained on a yearly basis until the available Reserve had been extracted. Witness Figuera noted a target of 65,000 BPD363.The Respondent's experts take as their main parameter about 40,000 BPD, resulting in a recovery of 184 million barrels between 2008 and 2032 (25 years), whereas on the basis of 70,000 BPD the Claimants' experts envisage recovering 205 million barrels between 2008 and 2023 (15 years). The profile to be retained by this Tribunal is thus placed in between a double margin, depending on the overall duration of the recovery (between 15 and 25 years) and the peak volume between the two extremes of 40,000 BPD and 70,000 BPD. The third factor is then the total recovery, but it seems less important given the fact that the experts' disagreement is in a range of 10% only. In order to determine whether these figures are compliant with the actual production of the field, the Tribunal will take account, as it has done for Petrozuata and Hamaca, of the data available on its record in respect of the sales of Corocoro oil and the corresponding volumes of production. The relevant figures will be analyzed and considered below.\n\nTestimony, 20 July 2009, para. 57.\n\n557.\n\nOne of the main arguments against a target of 70,000 BPD is based on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's assumption that the geology of the Corocoro site would never permit rates above 10,000 or 11,000 BPD per well. However, Mr. Pati\u00f1o argues that during the first 12 months when the wells were active, the average production per well of the three reservoirs 70A, 70B and 70E was approximately 1,500, 4,000 and 900 BPD, respectively364. Mr. Pati\u00f1o explains in this respect that injecting higher water quantities would not have the effect of increasing production; such a program would not add more oil to the ground, but it will increase the pressure on the oil and extend it for a longer time. This does not offer an adequate answer to the lower availability of oil than initially expected. Witness Marcano explains that reduced levels of water injection were caused by the lower initial production of the wells; less water was thus needed to replenish the reservoirs365.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 247.\n\nDirect Testimony, 6 January 2015, paras. 45-52.\n\n558.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it cannot resolve the controversy between the experts on the basis of geological and physical characteristics of the field that are not translated into actual oil production volumes. Its task consists of determining such volumes and to draw the appropriate consequences in respect of the Project's participant's loss.\n\n559.\n\nThe Claimants and their experts insist on the maximum production output of nearly 70,000 BPD referred to in the Development Plan Addendum (C-181, LECG-003). In fact, this plan identifies this number as a target, whereas the actual maximum figures varied between 64,000 and 66,500 BPD to be reached between 2007 and 2011, eventually 2013 (p. 50, 56-58). From then on, recovery would decline on a regular pace until 2026 (ending with about 10,000 BPD). The Project's Reserve for Phase I was estimated at 231 MMB; this was a mean of several probability estimates ranging between 89 and 163 MMB (p. 49/50). Production was estimated at 208 MMB over a period of 20 years (p. 8). The Claimants' experts submitted that they had reduced the figure of 231 MMB to 205 MMB366, not noting that this adjustment was already made by the Development Plan (to 208 MMB). The same experts rely on ConocoPhillips Corocoro RCAT Review of 7 August 2007 (LECG-050), where it is noted that the Phase I Recovery represents 205 MMB (p. 13, 48, 49/pdf), without explanation. The same Review notes that the daily production will vary between approximately 20,000 and 26,000 MMB in the years 2008 to 2013, before the average declines more seriously.\n\nConsolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 57.\n\n560.\n\nMr. Pati\u00f1o's production schedule is based on the PetroSucre Reservoir Model 2013 that has been prepared by this PDVSA affiliate and the other partner Eni367. The model includes all available data as of 2012. Mr. Pati\u00f1o's conclusions have not been elaborated by him but represent the production forecasts presented by the model for various scenarios368. The accumulated production of the field through 2032 was 183.8 MMB369. The Claimants' experts did not examine this Model nor Mr. Pati\u00f1o's presentation. This Model is extremely detailed and not limited to a simple assembly of slides as the RCAT Review. More important is the fact that this Model is six years more recent and includes actual production figures in the years 2008 and 2013, showing that the RCAT Review overestimated yearly production by a little bit less than half. The same production volumes are represented by the tables collecting the results derived from the collection of invoices for the period between 2008 and 2015370. Dr. Strickland's conclusions do not lead to another result, except for the correction that he thinks achievable if higher water and/or gas injection rates was used371. In the absence of supportive evidence for a production total of 205 MMB that goes above simple presentations based on slides, the Tribunal retains the figure of 183.8 MMB as the prospective total production until the end of Phase I.\n\nPati\u00f1o Appendix 36.\n\nCf. Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 226-236.\n\nCf. the Model (p. 136/S, 77/E) and Pati\u00f1o, Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 236.\n\nTables submitted by the Respondent on 20 March 2017, based on Figuera Appendices 84-89, R-527, Brailov-sky/Flores Appendices 359/360; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 14, p. 4292:14-4293:12 (Preziosi). See also Figuera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, para. 60; Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 104.\n\nCf. Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 18-20, 143-158.\n\n561.\n\nThe next question is then how to determine the year-by-year rate of production until the end. The rate at which Corocoro's wells will produce oil is uncertain. The PetroSucre Reservoir Model shows a peak period between 2009 and 2015 and a downward slope since 2016 that becomes regular as from about 2020, until the last year, 2032372. For the RCAT Review, the peak period is between 2009 and 2013, when the downward trend starts running until 2021. On the basis of these two documents, the Tribunal recognizes that while the peak periods are similar in their duration, the PetroSucre Model shows clearly lower volumes per year thereafter. This Model seems therefore more suitable for the purpose of assessing production over the whole duration of Phase I. In one respect, however, a correction has to be made. Mr. Pati\u00f1o and the PetroSucre Model provide for a term of production in 2032. The Composite Economic Model (CEM) determined the end of production in 2026 (p. 125, 128/pdf). This projection should prevail in a but-for scenario. The difference accumulates the volumes for the years 2027 to 2032 in PetroSucre's Model (*i.e.* 17,726 MMB). The Tribunal finds that the most suitable adjustment is to add a volume of 1,772 MMB to the production for each year between 2017 and 2026. Contrary to the findings in respect of the end of production to be accounted for the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects, the reduced production at Corocoro reflects real terms that can be compared to the Respondent's figures; moreover, the term in year 2026 does represent simply the end of phase I, when continuing extraction will be on schedule for phases II and III (not to be considered in this proceeding).\n\nCf. p. 176/S, 76/E; Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 236; Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 379.\n\n562.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal observes that the actual monthly peak production varied between 39,792 BPD (2011), 42,476 BPD (2012) and 39,170 BPD (2013), and will most probably become lower in the following years, in parallel to the field decline. Witness Figuera notes that in light of the production capability of the Corocoro field373, it turned out that the CPF was unnecessary374. This is, however, not a matter to be considered by this Tribunal.\n\nThe capacity of the IPF had been increased from 30,000 BPD to 42,000 BPD to accommodate production as additional wells came on line; Marcano, Direct Testimony, 6 January 2015, footnote 70; TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 10, p. 2997:9-12. The Witness added that they thus increased the production level to what had been planned through the IPF; the CPF was not a problem for the production of the field because they had the IPF (TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 10, p. 3039:13-3040:9).\n\nThird Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 107.\n\n563.\n\nThe figures submitted by the Parties together with the adjustment for the overall production duration retained by the CEM are therefore as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Corocoro - Production |\n|  | Claimants375 | Mr. Pati\u00f1o, based on PetroSucre Model376 | Respondent377 | Adjusted to duration as per CEM |\n|  | BPD | MMB | BPD | MMB | BPD | MMB | BPD | MMB |\n| 2007 \u00bd | 29,589 | 5,400 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 2008 | 21,408 | 7,814 |  |  | 19,624 | 7,182 | 19,624 | 7,182 |\n| 2009 | 64,954 | 23,708 |  |  | 31,461 | 11,483 | 31,461 | 11,483 |\n| 2010 | 66,263 | 24,186 |  |  | 36,033 | 13,152 | 36,033 | 13,152 |\n| 2011 | 66,485 | 24,267 |  |  | 36,204 | 13,214 | 36,204 | 13,214 |\n| 2012 | 66,546 | 24,356 |  |  | 36,829 | 13,479 | 36,829 | 13,479 |\n| 2013 | 57,745 | 21,077 |  |  | 36,537 | 13,336 | 36,537 | 13,336 |\n| 2014 | 42,126 | 15,376 | 35,176 | 13,052 | 35,176 | 12,839 | 35,176 | 12,839 |\n| 2015 | 31,833 | 11,619 | 33,066 | 12,134 | 33,066 | 12,069 | 33,066 | 12,069 |\n| 2016 | 27,476 | 10,056 | 30,128 | 11,027 | 30,128 | 11,027 | 30,128 | 11,027 |\n| 2017 | 25,163 | 9,184 | 25,838 | 9,431 | 25,838 | 9,431 | 30,693 | 11,204 |\n| 2018 | 22,163 | 8,080 | 20,925 | 7,638 | 20,925 | 7,638 | 25,781 | 9,411 |\n| 2019 | 19,412 | 7,085 | 18,276 | 6,671 | 18,276 | 6,671 | 23,132 | 8,444 |\n| 2020 | 17,164 | 6,392 | 16,321 | 5,974 | 16,321 | 5,974 | 21,222 | 7,747 |\n| 2021 | 15,836 | 5,780 | 14,883 | 5,432 | 14,883 | 5,432 | 19,737 | 7,205 |\n| 2022 |  |  | 13,677 | 4,992 | 13,677 | 4,992 | 18,532 | 6,765 |\n| 2023 |  |  | 12,317 | 4,496 | 12,317 | 4,496 | 17,173 | 6,268 |\n| 2024 |  |  | 10,843 | 3,969 | 10,843 | 3,969 | 15,729 | 5,741 |\n| 2025 |  |  | 10,237 | 3,736 | 10,237 | 3,736 | 15,090 | 5,508 |\n| 2026 |  |  | 9,659 | 3,525 | 9,659 | 3,525 | 14,512 | 5,297 |\n| 2027 |  |  | 9,136 | 3,335 | 9,136 | 3,335 |  |  |\n| 2028 |  |  | 8,645 | 3,164 | 8,645 | 3,164 |  |  |\n| 2029 |  |  | 8,236 | 3,006 | 8,236 | 3,006 |  |  |\n| 2030 |  |  | 7,849 | 2,865 | 7,849 | 2,865 |  |  |\n| 2031 |  |  | 7,496 | 2,736 | 7,496 | 2,736 |  |  |\n| 2032 |  |  | 7,158 | 2,620 | 7,158 | 2,620 |  |  |\n| Total |  | 204,380 |  |  |  | 181,371 |  | 181,371 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n\nMMB from CLEX-086, mostly based on CEM (LECG-085), p. 127/128/pdf, and further aligned to the Claimants' Tables of 20 March 2017.\n\nThe numbers for MMB are taken from Pati\u00f1o, Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, para. 236.

Tables submitted on 20 March 2017), and it offers the conversions into BPD. Witness Figuera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, para. 60; Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 104; Figuera, Appendices 84-89, Brailovsky/Flores, Appendices 359, 360.\n\nH. By-Products\n--------------\n\n564.\n\nThe Projects were of course producing oil in very large quantities representing the bulk of the extraction work undertaken. Nevertheless, this operation also produced so-called By-products, like coke, sulfur, natural gas and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas). Such products are listed in the models, mainly the Composite Economic Model (CEM, LECG-085) and the Ameriven Economic Model (Hamaca, LECG-129). They represent approximately 2 to 5% of the overall quantity of products extracted from the fields.\n\n565.\n\nIn large parts, such By-products were sold on the respective markets and produced revenues. The Claimants therefore may have submitted that they had suffered a loss comparable to the loss of the revenue from the sale of oil, albeit in much smaller proportion.\n\n566.\n\nAs regards By-products the Claimants' initial request for relief did not determine the nature of the loss they suffered or request for compensation. Expressly or implicitly, the Claimants connected the damages claimed \"to their interest in the Projects\". Such a broad designation, neither exclude nor include the By-products. When explaining the fair market value of the Projects, the Claimants Memorial of 15 September 2008 relied on forecast oil prices (para. 449), but no mention is made of the pricing of By-products. The same results from the Claimants' Reply of 2 November 2009.\n\n567.\n\nSome elements can be found in the description of the loss of each Project and the ensuing calculation of damages. When the Claimants' Memorial on Quantum of 19 May 2014 determines the volume of production, the subject is oil production exclusively. The By-products are not mentioned. In order to quantify their losses, the Claimants relied on their experts who assessed as first component \"the volumes of crude oil and upgraded syncrude produced by the Projects\"378, which are based on the \"Reserves figures\"379, which are composed of oil exclusively. The Petrozuata production profile was based on oil (para. 120). Turning to Hamaca, the same submission noted the volume of extracted crude and of upgraded syncrude, adding to this \"as well as saleable Byproducts such as sulphur and coke\" (para. 139), but without further elaboration on this point. The price data referred to oil and not to the By-products (paras. 168-176)380. The amounts claimed by the Claimants in their request for relief reflected damages for the lost cash flows that would have accrued \"from their interests\". The Reply on Quantum of 13 October 2014 uses the same terms. By-products are not mentioned. Again, in the Final Consolidated Brief of 30 December 2016, the By-products do not appear; the Claimants request this Tribunal to adopt production profiles based on oil381.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on Quantum, para. 105.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 113.\n\nIn respect of the production profile under the Hamaca Discriminatory Action provision the Claimants' experts excluded By-products; TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 6, p. 1770:14-17 (Abdala). The Respondent's experts shared this opinion; Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, footnote 295.\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, paras. 14(a), 113, 130, 305, 499.\n\n568.\n\nWhen the Tribunal raised the question at the final hearing in September 2017, Counsel for the Claimants affirmed that the By-products had always been part of their case and that their sale was counted in the models. The sale of these products was part of what had been taken away from them through the expropriation. He submitted that these products are included in their claim as they were in the models382. Faced with the observation that the By-products do not appear in the Claimants' briefs, Counsel undertook to provide the references383. They never did, although there was ample time left to include such information in their closing statement.\n\nTR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 4893:11-4894:15, 4896:21-4897:4, 4899:1-3 (Friedman). Figures on production and sale of By-products are contained in the CEM (LECG-085) in respect of Petrozuata and Hamaca, not for Corocoro. The CEM is a document of 411 pages; the Claimants did not refer to any precise page(s) where the relevant information could be found. This document is not numbered consecutively nor indexed.\n\nTR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 4894:17-22, 4896:18-21, 4899:4-11 (Friedman).\n\n569.\n\nCounsel for the Claimants also submitted that in any event, both Parties agree that there is value in the By-products and that this should be part of the compensation owed by the Respond-ent384. He thought that the matter should be decided by the Tribunal's decision on the production levels. The By-products are thus part of the claim for the full value of what was taken from the Claimants.\n\nTR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 4895:12-4896:5 (Friedman).\n\n570.\n\nNonetheless, despite the Claimants' declaration, their claim must show that the loss of revenue related to these By-products has been included therein. The reference to the models may serve as a starting point to demonstrate the projections prevailing at that time. However, the models do not report on actual prices and do not offer a basis for an *ex post* valuation at the time of the Award. The Claimants have not presented sales figures that could serve as a basis for the estimation of revenues obtained. The By-products were sold under long-term contracts that included price formulas tied to market conditions385; they are not on the Tribunal's record. There is more: The Claimants' submissions do not contain a statement that their claim includes By-products, not even through an implicit reference to the models. When they introduced their respective production profile for Petrozuata and Hamaca, the Claimants referred to oil exclusively386. Their experts' Consolidated Update Report of 17 November 2016 does not address By-products. The experts' key valuation inputs were crude oil volumes and prices387 and their discounted cash flow was based on crude oil production388. Their Report of 19 May 2014 does so very shortly, and in relation to royalty prices only and without explaining how they used their sources of information and made their calculations389. The figures noted in the experts' valuations' (CLEX-086) are not referenced to their sources and not provided with any comment.\n\nPetrozuata Annual Management Report to Lenders, 1 April 2007 (C-376, p. 4/pdf).\n\nCf. Claimants' Final Submission on Quantum, paras. 179, 226.\n\nConsolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 5(a)(c).\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 45, 49, 54.\n\nCf. page 59. The experts refer to their own collection of price forecast (CLEX-011), without providing any explanation. No documentary evidence was supplied.\n\n571.\n\nThe document entitled \"Phillips Petroleum Company Justification and Premises\" dated 9 October 1996 (C-122) had been presented by the Claimants as the basis for the Phillips' CEO Wayne Allen decision of 10 October 1996 to enter into the joint study agreement and to move forward with the Hamaca Project390. The document noted that there \"is no positive cash flow anticipated from the sales of the sulfur or coke byproducts\", and that \"gas sales were not included in the economics\"391. The Claimants' present view is that the models prevail over such a document; they represent the reality that is very different from the expectation in the 1990s392. Nonetheless, the explanation is a bit short and unsatisfactory when observing that the By-products, while certainly mentioned in the models, were not included in the Claimants' submissions.\n\nCf. Claimants' Memorial, para. 109.\n\nC-122, p. 7/pdf. The Hamaca Confidential Preliminary Information Memorandum prepared by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in August 2000 notes that the sale of By-products is expected, but that the Base Case Projections assume zero net profits from the sale of By-products. (p. 61/pdf).\n\nTR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 4897:8-4898:22 (Friedman).\n\n572.\n\nThe Respondent did not address the matter in its Consolidated Brief of 30 December 2016. Its experts have reproduced the sales figures provided by Witness Figuera for 2007 and 2008393, and for the later years, they projected the volumes they found in the Composite Economic Model (CEM), as the Claimants' experts did, and then multiplied EHCO production by the proportions found in the CEM for each of the different By-products394. This seems to imply that the pricing follows the prices for EHCO - a position that would require further explanation and evidence.\n\nTestimony, 20 July 2009, paras. 13 (Petrozuata), 39 (Hamaca).\n\nCf. Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 75, 249 (Petrozuata), 84, 260 (Hamaca), 140 (royalties).\n\n573.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the very few elements provided in the Claimants' documentation and expert reports do not permit an assessment of what would represent the loss of revenue resulting from an expropriation that included the By-products.\n\n574.\n\nThe Tribunal has the power to make a ruling on any \"question submitted\" (Art. 45(2) and 48(3) of the ICSID Convention). When the proceeding is on the merits, this requires a \"claim\" (as this results from Art. 46 of the ICSID Convention, providing for \"additional claims\") and a \"dispute\" (Art. 41(2), 43(b), 46 of the ICSID Convention). The Claimants in this proceeding have not presented a claim for compensation in respect of alleged losses of revenues accruing from the sale of By-products. Therefore, the Tribunal has no power to render a decision in this respect.\n\n**VII. Costs**\n--------------\n\nA. Petrozuata and Hamaca\n------------------------\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\na. Overview\n-----------\n\n575.\n\nThe Claimants explain that for the next input to the DCF computation in order to determine the Project's expected capital and operating expenses their experts rely on the same pre-expropri-ation business planning documents they use for production, *i.e.* the Composite Economic Model (CEM, LECG-085) for Petrozuata, and the Ameriven Economic Model (AEM or PAM, LECG-129) for Hamaca. They then adjust those costs to account for inflation in the industry395. International tribunals have established that contemporaneous business planning documents are preferred sources of evidence, as the *ADC v. Hungary* Tribunal held396. Both the ICC397 and the ICSID398 Tribunals in the *Mobil* case applied this principle, noting that the Parties agreed the budget on costs before the dispute arose. Venezuela had acknowledged that this was the correct approach399.\n\nCf. Abdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, paras. 5(b), 60, 144-146.\n\n*ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award of 2 October 2006 (CL-15).\n\n*Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. and PDVSA Cerro Negro, S.A.*, ICC Case No.15416/JRF/CA, Final Award of 23 December 2011 (R-462).\n\n*Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd.,* et al *. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award of 9 October 2014 (CL-348).\n\nVenezuela's Counter-Memorial, paras. 312, 341.\n\n576.\n\nHowever, since its Counter-Memorial on Quantum, and with the support of its new experts Brailovsky and Flores, the Respondent has taken a different view. While still using the Project's pre-expropriation models as the baseline on costs, Venezuela asserts that billions of dollars in \"additional costs\" have been or will be incurred by the post-expropriation projects, resulting in nearly doubling the expected operating expenses and quadrupling the expected capital expenses. The effects on the cost projections are considerable. While the Claimants' overall cost projection is US$ 36.8 billion, Brailovsky and Flores have US$ 50 billion.\n\n577.\n\nVenezuela claims that oil production at Petrozuata and Hamaca is diminishing. It thus argues that more costs will be spent for substantially less oil. According to Brailovsky and Flores' model, cash flow became negative in 2015 and the Projects will suffer substantial losses in the future, to such an extent that the Projects should already have been shut down. This is not what happened. The post-expropriation documents show that PetroAnzo\u00e1tegui and PetroPiar generated US$ 8.8 billion to their shareholders over the 7/ years from June 2007 to 2014.\n\n578.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the alleged \"additional cost\" components are (i) unreasonable and/or unnecessary; (ii) unsupported by the evidence; (iii) ever changing, thus unreliable. Venezuela has not demonstrated that such costs had been incurred, and, even if so, that they would have been incurred by the Claimants. Venezuela's claims as to costs are addressed in Mr. Earnest's Consolidated Report.\n\nb. The Respondent's claimed \"Additional Costs\" are unreasonable and/or unnecessary\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n579.\n\nThe Claimants submit that this assertion is true for both the additional capital and operating expenses alleged. Furthermore, Brailovsky and Flores use the lowest possible exchange rate to Bolivar-denominated costs.\n\n580.\n\nAccording to Venezuela, Petrozuata and Hamaca will incur turnaround costs in multiples greater than those projected prior to the expropriation. The alleged future costs are also greater than the actual costs incurred in 2005 and 2006. Venezuela argues that refinery maintenance costs are increasing worldwide. A brochure from Salomon Associates refers to a 15% annual increase400. This is not a reliable data source, but essentially a marketing document. For Hamaca, Venezuela adds maintenance costs that were called \"PRAC\" (Restoration Plan for Critical Assets) and \"PREM\" (Restoration Plan for Major Equipment), totaling approximately US$ 1 billion, that were never contemplated in the Project's Economic Model. Such massive expenditures have been useless. Venezuela asks the Tribunal to accept that despite huge claimed expenditures, the Hamaca upgrader will not operate on an OSF higher than 72.85% and be subject to increasing annual probability of catastrophic collapse.\n\nFiguera Appendix 124.\n\n581.\n\nThe Claimants recall that Venezuela asserts operational costs allegedly spent on trucks to collect and deliver the coke and sulphur by the two upgraders to the Petrozuata Project's solids and handling facility. Mr. Figuera submits that the costs incurred between 2009 and 2014 are in the range of a quarter of a billion dollars. He argues that these costs became necessary because Petro-zuata's new management failed to repair that facility after it was damaged by a fire in 2009. For the Claimants, a prudent operator would never spend US$ 250 million for such transport since the cost of repairing the facility was in the range of US$ 37.5 million401. The answer appears to be given by a governmental report finding that PDVSA had entered into improper contracts with CUFERCA, the trucking company (C-649). The Claimants mentions as another example the electricity generators purchased in 2010.\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 336; in the Claimants' Reply on Quantum, para. 314, the corresponding amount was US$ 47 million.\n\n582.\n\nThe Respondent's experts rely on an incoherent mix of alleged historical and projected capital and operating expenses, many multiples greater than those agreed by the Project participants prior to the expropriation. Many of these costs are unverifiable, contradictory or subject to doublecounting. For instance, its valuation experts add new well repair costs forecast by Mr. Figuera but they do not take out those costs which are already included in the Project plans.\n\n583.\n\nVenezuela's costs figures are compounded by its inflation of those costs through exchange rate manipulations. The Respondent's experts assume that most operating expenses, half of all turnaround costs, and 30% of capital expenditures are incurred by the Projects in local currency, *i.e.* Bolivars. They apply to these costs Venezuelan inflation rates, and then convert them back into US$ at the lowest official exchange rate, thereby maximizing their negative impact on the Project's valuations.\n\n584.\n\nThe Claimants' experts explain that multiple legal exchange rates were available in Venezuela. A rational private operator would have had available numerous methods to access more favorable legal exchange rates or make payments directly in U.S. dollars. Experts Brailovsky and Flores do not meaningfully contest the options the experts Abdala and Spiller propose, like: (i) The Projects could have financed their operations through intercompany loans, which would allow access to more favorable, legal exchange rates. (ii) The Projects could have outsourced certain functions to third-party service providers and pay them in U.S. dollars. (iii) The Projects could have hired international suppliers and pay them in U.S. dollars.\n\n585.\n\nFor the period 2007 through early 2016, experts Brailovsky and Flores ignore these realistic options and apply the lowest possible exchange rate in their damages model. But even PDVSA does not do that. The financial statements confirm that the post-expropriation projects have in fact obtained Bolivars using more favorable foreign exchange rate regimes than those assumed by the Respondent's experts. These experts have accepted this fact. They maintain, however, that those preferable rates are allegedly available only to mixed companies, and not to projects operating under Association Agreements. This suggestion must fail. Exchange Agreement No. 9402 does not make such a distinction, both before and since the expropriation. Further, the suggestion that Venezuela would discriminate against the two Projects in the but-for world is unsustainable. The forced migration is not a valid argument in support of the application of less favorable exchange rates to the Claimants.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores Appendix 240\n\n586.\n\nFor the period 10 March 2016 to 31 December 2016, Venezuela's experts adopt a different approach, assuming that the Projects would have had access to the more favorable, floating DICOM rate, but only 50% of the time. The experts have no explanation for this split. When realistic exchange rates are applied to the \"additional costs\", their impact is substantially reduced. When more favorable rates are applied, the Respondent's experts' cost projections become similar to the costs used in the Claimants' experts' model.\n\nc. The Respondent's claimed \"Additional Costs\" are unsupported\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n587.\n\nVenezuela's \"additional costs\" claims should be rejected for a second reason: absence of proof. The Respondent's experts rely on alleged cost information provided by Mr. Figuera. Most of Mr. Figuera's \"actual\" information is either unsupported or prepared for this arbitration. The documents provided are insufficient. Notable is a quarter-page document in support of the alleged 2015 turnaround costs at Petrozuata, in the amount of US$ 1.1 billion. Mr. Figuera later admitted that the US$ 1.1 billion figure should be divided by three to account for future devaluations of the Bolivar. It has not been explained why this split applies to the Petrozuata 2015 turnaround only, and how this document can support such costs for a turnaround that finally did not take place.\n\n588.\n\nThe ever-changing nature of Venezuela's \"additional cost\" allegations renders them unreliable. In 2014 Venezuela told this Tribunal that the Projects would incur over one billion dollars for certain works in 2015, while Mr. Figuera has since admitted that those amounts have not been spent, and with respect to some, never will: (a) Solids Handling Facility Modernization. Venezuela initially claimed for 2015 US$ 200 million in costs to expand and modernize the facility. Two years later, Mr. Figuera withdrew the claim, submitting that no additional costs were needed. (b) Barge costs. Mr. Figuera also claimed that Petrozuata and Hamaca would each incur US$ 25.2 million to haul coke between 2015 and 2017. But he also admitted that such costs have never been incurred, and may never be incurred. (c) Trucking costs. Mr. Figuera submitted that Petrozuata would incur such annual costs for US$ 67 million per year from 2015 to 2017, but then withdrew the suggestion, such costs having never been incurred. In light of these most striking examples, one can conclude that other claims for \"additional costs\" are phantoms as well, as further explained by Mr. Earnest's Consolidated Report.\n\nd. Comments on the Respondent's Cost Estimations\n------------------------------------------------\n\n589.\n\nWhen addressing the Costs Estimations submitted by the Respondent on 2 June 2017, the Claimants underscore in their Introductory Notes that neither they nor the Respondent base their case on actual costs in the post-expropriation period. For the Claimants, the Projects' pre-expro-priation business planning documents are the best reflection of the expected costs in the but-for scenario, combined with annual industry inflation rates as their experts have done. The Respondent uses the same sources, but then (i) increases the figures by applying inappropriate inflation and exchange rate assumptions, and (ii) adds \"additional\" costs categories that do not appear in the preexpropriation models. The Claimants observe an evidentiary deficiency in the Respondent's approach, because only about 11.5% of the costs in Venezuela's valuation are supported by documents reflecting alleged actual expenses that the post-expropriation Projects have incurred.\n\n590.\n\nThe Claimants recall that the cost projections in the CEM included the following categories: CAPEX: G&A, Upstream Facilities, Upgrader Facilities; OPEX: Upstream, Upgrader, G&A, Third Party. The Respondent has changed the figures relating to these categories. First, the Respondent inflates all costs in assuming that certain percentages will be incurred in Bolivars and then inflates these costs using domestic consumer inflation rates in Venezuela, before converting them back into US$ using the lowest existing official exchange rate. However, the Respondent does not indicate the exchange rate used or obtained for any particular cost item. Additionally, the Respondent ignores that more favorable exchange rates had existed in Venezuela over the period since the expropriation in 2007 and were accessible if only reasonable management techniques had been used.\n\n591.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants object that the Respondent replaced certain costs included in the CEM with much higher figures based largely on Mr. Figuera's unsupported testimony, specifically drilling costs, turnaround costs, well repair costs (and coker repair costs at Hamaca). Above these estimations of its own making, the Respondent added massive \"additional\" cost categories, like: CAPEX: Drilling, Turnarounds, Others; OPEX: Well Repairs, PREMs, Catalysts Unit 16, Tank 12 Repairs, Solids Handling Facility Trucking; Others. These purported additional costs remain largely unsupported, although the Projects must still have available detailed records of any specific expenditure in the post-expropriation period. In any event, these costs are unreasonable, hugely inflated and indicative of operational deficiencies. The purpose of the Respondent's option to rely on financial statements is unclear. They have not been part of and are inconsistent with the Respondent's pleaded case, they do not represent the but-for scenario and are incomplete and insufficiently detailed to be useful. When taking the example of costs for electricity generation at Pe-troPiar and the costs for hiring third parties to truck coke to the coke pile, the Respondent ends up with double counting because it does not subtract related costs already included in the AEM (also PAM).\n\n592.\n\nIn conclusion, the operating costs and capital expenditures shown in the Claimants' 20 March 2017 tables and based on the Composite Economic Model (CEM) for Petrozuata, and on the Ameriven Economic Model (AEM) for Hamaca remain the only principled and reliable assessment of costs in the but-for scenario.\n\n*2. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\na. Overview\n-----------\n\n593.\n\nIn line with its preference for an *ex ante* valuation, the Respondent submits that based on its experts' analysis, costs related to the Petrozuata Project are reflected in the ConocoPhillips Composite Economic Model (CEM) in 2006 U.S. dollars, escalated (i) to the date of valuation, 26 June 2007, using the oil field and gas field machinery PPI index, and (ii) from the valuation date forward, using a composite inflation index calculated as the weighted average of long-term US inflation projections (85%) and the rate of change of their 2007 WTI price forecast (15%). Two exceptions are the inclusion of well costs consistent with the Project's experience and a US$ 20 million cost for an EOR pilot project in the Reserve Area. As with Petrozuata, in an *ex ante* valuation of Hamaca as of 26 June 2007, the Respondent's experts have proceeded in following the same method, however taking as the basis of their projections the estimates set forth in the contemporaneous model used by Petrolera Ameriven (PAM), in 2006 U.S. dollars, escalated to 26 June 2007. The Respondent further notes that lower volumes of EHCO and CCO production had been projected; therefore, its costs in the *ex ante* valuation are actually lower than the costs projected by the Claimants.\n\n594.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimants' reliance on the *Mobil* cases for the proposition that pre-nationalization budgets should be used for projecting future costs. In both cases, the tribunals derived the value of cash flows in using *ex ante* information as of June 2007. There is no basis for doing so in an *ex post* valuation. The Claimants also argue that in the first phase of this arbitration, the Respondent's experts accepted the LECG projections regarding costs, noting that the Parties were not differing substantially with respect to costs. This was so because in the first phase of this case, the Respondent and its experts were conducting *ex ante* valuations, based on information available as of June 2007, thus using the same base of information as the Claimants did. In an *ex post* valuation, estimates for the future are no longer necessary, since the categories of costs and the actual costs incurred both are now known. Under those circumstances, it is wholly inappropriate to substitute projections made ten years ago for the figures resulting from actual experience. For example, as of June 2007, the costs associated with the periodic turnarounds had to be estimated on what was known at the time. Now, in 2016, not only the numbers but also the scope and the costs of those turnarounds are known.\n\n595.\n\nFurther, the Claimants seem to forget the undisputed fact that as oil prices rose, so did costs, as reflected in the HIS CERA Upstream Operating Cost Index (UOCI) and the HIS CERA Upstream Capital Cost Index (UCCI) upon which the Respondent's experts rely. The Claimants also do not take account of the fact that Venezuela has suffered high rates of inflation since the nationalization, with limited offsetting devaluations of the Bolivar. During the period from mid-2007 to January 2010, inflation ran at the rate of 30.3% per annum, meaning an overall increase in prices of 89.4%. At the official exchange rate, which remained at Bs. 2.15 per US dollar during that entire period, the US dollar equivalent of those costs incurred in Bolivars rose by the same percentage.\n\n596.\n\nThe Claimants do not seem to understand that while they should benefit from higher revenues resulting from oil price increases in the historical period, they should not remain immune from higher costs. They also object to the *post hoc* nature of the Respondent's current claims. Contrary to their allegations, these costs were reasonable and necessary and supported by evidence. The Claimants have failed to show that these costs would have been avoided if only a ConocoPhillips subsidiary had remained a project participant.\n\n597.\n\nThe Respondent does not believe the Claimants when they contend that the cost for the 2011 turnaround at Petrozuata (US$ 236 million in 2011 US dollars) was significantly higher than that incurred in the 2005 turnaround, which cost about US$ 23 million (in 2005 US dollars). Mr. Earnest, the Claimants' expert, fails to grasp the fact that all of the upgraders at the Jose Complex have experienced much higher costs for the post-nationalization turnarounds than those experienced prior to the nationalization, while they have been managed by the foreign partners (with the exception of those at PetroAnzo\u00e1tegui). At the PetroCede\u00f1o (Sincor) project, the maintenance activities during the first turnaround in 2004 cost US$ 71.6 million and involved interventions at 287 equipment items, while the maintenance activities during the 2008 turnaround (managed by Total) cost US$ 266 million and entailed intervention at 913 equipment items. Similarly, at the PetroMon-agas (Cerro Negro) project, the costs went up from US$ 27.4 million in 2006 to US$ 393 million in 2012, while the number of equipment items concerned was 84 in 2006 and 1,215 in 2012. At Petrozuata, the first turnaround in 2005 involved the intervention at 385 equipment items, while the second turnaround in 2011 entailed the intervention at 752 equipment items. In short, the postnationalization turnarounds have been more extensive and more expensive at all of the upgraders.\n\n598.\n\nThe Respondent also disagrees with the Claimants with respect to the solids handling facility, when they argue that the costs associated with (a) the 2009 fire and repairs and (b) transporting coke to, and handling of the coke at a new storage location following the fire were unreasonable, contending that the facility could be repaired for US$ 47 million. This is based on confusion, as the Respondent was referring not to the full costs, but to the uninsured amount of US$ 45,263,789. After repair, the facility operated at less than full capacity, resulting in higher costs. The Claimants acknowledge the costs that have been incurred by PetroAnzo\u00e1tegui, as well as PetroPiar, in trucking the coke to the alternative storage locations and managing the huge coke pile, but they claim that a prudent and efficient operator would not have engaged in such conduct. This argument ignores that upgraders produce large volumes of coke in the coker units, which needs to be removed from the pits quickly; when the solids handling facility was not available, additional costs were incurred for trucking the coke away. The Claimants assert that the costs were fabricated by the Respondent. They were not. The Respondent established that (a) the costs for the fire repairs in 2009, net of insurance proceeds, were US$ 37,531,649, and (b) the trucking and handling costs, net of insurance proceeds, through 2014, have been US$ 273 million.\n\n599.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that the Claimants also appear to challenge the costs for wells and well pads. In the first phase of this case, Mr. Figuera stated that the experience at Petrozuata was that single-lateral wells in 2009 cost approximately US$ 2.9 million, and multilateral wells about US$ 3.5 million. The Claimants did not cross-examine him on this point. At the 2010 Hearing, Mr. Lyons also confirmed that in its own presentation in October 2006, ConocoPhillips was estimating a cost for US$ 3.5 million per well for drilling costs. The Claimants have no basis for disputing the costs associated with upstream activities, which are in line with historical costs. Dr. Strickland did not comment on the costs associated with wells or well pads.\n\n600.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that at Petrozuata, additional firefighting systems have been installed. Through 2014, US$ 10,732,625 have been spent. As Mr. Figuera explained, the remainder of the US$ 100 million in estimated costs associated with the upgraders will be spent in the coming years. The upgrader at Petrozuata, like the other upgraders in the fields, are required to install electricity generating equipment in order to free up the grid for the population. That project, with an estimated cost of US$ 142 million (in 2010 US dollars) has been deferred pending the completion of the gas line to the Jos\u00e9 Complex. The Claimants object that these costs were not included in the pre-nationalization business plans or models. This underscores the absurdity of relying on those plans in an *ex post* valuation.\n\n601.\n\nTurning to Hamaca, the Respondent begins by noting that the Claimants argue that the turnaround costs at PetroPiar are significantly higher than those projected as of June 2007. They further claim that the Respondent adds so-called PREM maintenance costs of US$ 1 billion that were never contemplated in the Project's Economic Model. But the fact that such costs have not been contemplated in 2006 does not disqualify those costs from inclusion in the *ex post* valuation analysis. To the contrary, the fact that those costs were and are considered necessary by the Project partners underscores the folly of relying on outdated plans and models as a basis for an *ex post* valuation.\n\n602.\n\nMr. Earnest's comparison between the costs for turnarounds before and those which occurred since is misleading, even more than it was for Petrozuata. Mr. Earnest recognizes that the 2006 Hamaca upgrader turnaround is being described as a partial turnaround. The Project partners referred to it as a \"Pit Stop\" and it cost only US$ 29 million (in 2006 US dollars). Mr. Earnest ignores economic realities. First, Solomon Associates, a well-known firm in these matters, has reported that the cost of turnarounds averaged a 15% increase each year from 2000 to 2008. Second, during the period between 2006 and 2009 (when the first real turnaround occurred) Venezuela experienced inflation at an annual average rate of 26.3%. Even based on Mr. Earnest's estimates, a turnaround in 2009 would have cost US$ 150 million. That is the figure that should be compared to the US$ 223.7 million incurred in implementation of the turnaround in 2009.\n\n603.\n\nIn 2006, the partners estimated the magnitude of the June 2008 turnaround as 5-10 times greater than the 2006 turnaround. In fact, the 2009 turnaround involved the intervention at seven times the number of equipment items as had been tested during the 2006 pit stop. On this basis, one would obtain a base figure of US$ 145 million, which will become, when accounted for industry and country inflation, a cost for a full turnaround at PetroPiar in 2009 of US$ 256 million. That is higher than the amount actually incurred. The cost for the combined PRAC/turnaround in 2012 of US$ 313.2 million is also in line with these estimates.\n\n604.\n\nMr. Earnest's opinion should also be compared with his May 2009 report in the ICC *Mobil* case, where he recognized the upcoming cost for the turnaround at PetroPiar and thought that the costs for the smaller turnaround at Cerro Negro could be raised above the expected US$ 100 million. The maintenance activities during the 2012 turnaround at PetroMonagas cost US$ 393 million. In comparison and given the relative size and complexity of the PetroPiar upgrader as compared with that of PetroMonagas, the costs of the major maintenance work at PetroPiar can hardly be considered unwarranted.\n\n605.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that other significant costs actually incurred by PetroPiar were not included in the pre-nationalization economic model and not mentioned in the first phase of this case. It was only in 2011 that Chevron and CVP made the determination that the upgrader would require annual major maintenance activity in the form of the PREM programs that commenced in 2012 and will run through 2022. That decision resulted from the detailed assessment of the upgrader following its continued poor performance despite the extensive 2009 turnaround. To date, PetroPiar has incurred US$ 357 million in connection with the PREM activities conducted annually between 2012 and 2015. The incidents that occurred with Tank 12 required repairs that could not appear in the 2006 model.\n\n606.\n\nThe installation of electrical generating capacity was equally not included in the 2006 economic model. This issue arose in November 2009, when the Government made the decision to require PDVSA and its affiliates to reduce their reliance on hydroelectric power in light of the needs of the communities in which they operate and the nation-wide shortage of power. In accordance with Decree 6,992 PetroPiar has installed 40 megawatts of capacity at a cost of approximately US$ 95 million in a project that was headed by Chevron. The Claimants and Mr. Earnest claim that these costs are too high, but the documentation submitted by the Respondent cannot seriously be contested.\n\n607.\n\nIn sum, the Respondent submits that there is no basis for excluding costs that have been and will be incurred in the post-nationalization period simply because those costs were not contemplated prior to the nationalization and not included in the modeling that was carried out at that time. The Claimants have not shown that if their employees had conducted the operations, those costs would have been avoided.\n\nb. The Respondent's Cost Estimations\n------------------------------------\n\n608.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Claimants that neither Party has based its \"but-for\" case on actual costs incurred by the Projects in the historical period. For the Respondent that is because many of the costs incurred resulted from the fact that the new mixed companies, operating under the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law, have been authorized to produce and sell blended crude oil. In contrast, the Projects operating under the Association Agreements were only authorized to sell upgraded products. Therefore, certain costs in the historical period are to be excluded, just as certain revenues (from blended sales) have to be excluded.\n\n609.\n\nFor the Respondent, the assumption that costs in the \"but-for\" world would remain the same for more than three decades as they were projected in a 2006 model is invalid for the Projects as they would be invalid for any project, but especially for a megaproject in the oil industry. It is indisputable that large costs items were not included in or contemplated by the 2006 models, for Petrozuata (CEM) as for Hamaca (AEM or PAM). Such a position is nonsensical and defeats the basic purpose of an *ex post* analysis. If the Claimants argue that account be taken of what has actually happened in the field, they have a heavy burden of establishing the inappropriateness of the actual costs incurred. They have not come close to meeting that burden. There is no doubt, for instance, that substantial additional costs were incurred for items such as turnarounds and firefighting improvements, which make the Claimants' position of ignoring all these costs irrational. The overwhelming majority of the cost figures the Claimants say are unsupported are in fact based on the starting figures in the CEM and the AEM, but then provided with information on inflation and exchange rates. The rest of the costs the Claimants say are unsupported are in fact attributable to drilling and well repair costs that are not only supported by Mr. Figuera and Mr. Pati\u00f1o but also corroborated by the Claimants' own evidence in the record.\n\n610.\n\nThe Claimants simply brush aside any cost not included in the 2006 model on the unwarranted assumption that it would not have been incurred in the but-for world. The record shows, for instance, that the Projects incurred significant costs relating to the upgrader maintenance, including the Petrozuata 2011 turnaround, costs that would have been the same if ConocoPhillips had remained in the Projects. Similarly, the post-nationalization incidents that resulted in the required repairs to the Solids Handling Facility and the trucking and handling of solids were not contemplated in the 2006 model; the associated costs would have been incurred regardless of whether ConocoPhillips was a Project participant.\n\n611.\n\nWith respect to inflation, the Respondent do not share the Claimants' position that a U.S. inflation index should apply to both US$ and Bolivar costs in the CEM, even though Venezuelan inflation was far higher than inflation as captured in that U.S. index. There is nothing inappropriate to take account of the currency proportion involved in OPEX (70% bolivars/30% US$) and CAPEX (30% Bolivars/70% US$). These percentages were included in Mr. Figuera's testimony and have never been contested403. A large portion of costs incurred in Bolivars were for labor-related expenses and such costs are correctly inflated on the basis of domestic, consumer inflation rates in Venezuela. When the Petrozuata 2011 turnaround took place, it was after almost two years of Venezuelan inflation cumulating in a rate of 51%; the impact of such high inflation cannot be measured correctly when turning costs in US$ in order to subject the expense to much lower US inflation rates.\n\nFiguera, Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 59. The Tribunal notes that the other references given by the Respondent do not contain this information.\n\n612.\n\nThe Claimants contend again that there were multiple legal exchange rates available, but they never explain how this could have been done when every Exchange Agreement prior to Exchange Agreement No. 35 (issued in March 2016) provided that US$ obtained in the sale of hydrocarbons could only be exchanged at the official rate (CADIVI), which was Bs. 2.15 per US$ until 7 January 2010, Bs. 4.3 per US$ from 8 January 2010 until 7 February 2013, and Bs. 6.3 per US$ from 8 February 2013 until 9 March 2016. Exchange Agreement No. 35 applied only to PDVSA, its subsidiaries and mixed companies.\n\n613.\n\nThe Claimants may say that they inflate costs using \"annual industry inflation rates\", but what they actually do is that (a) they have converted all costs in the model that are in Bolivars into 2006 US$, (b) added these additional US$ costs to the existing US$ costs retained in the model to obtain total costs in US$, and then (c) inflated the total costs using a US inflation index (the US Producer Price Index for oil industrial commodities). That is an exercise that completely ignores Venezuelan inflation, as if the Projects would be operated entirely in the United States and not in Venezuela.\n\n614.\n\nThe Respondent also recalls that it was the Claimants who insisted on the production of financial statements of the mixed companies. These statements reflect the actual costs incurred by the Projects in the post-nationalization period, even if one were to exclude the costs related to blending. Further, many of the Claimants' comments on the financial statements make little sense. Thus, when production remained relatively flat, this did not have as a consequence that costs behaved the same way, which would ignore the enormous inflation caused by the increase in oil prices, particularly in the summer of 2008.\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\na. Preliminary observations\n---------------------------\n\n615.\n\nThe evidentiary situation with respect to costs is deplorable and surprising. Indeed, if there is one category of items that should easily be documented, it should be the costs that have at least passed the stage of invoicing and payment that can be shown by documents. The Tribunal's record is grossly incomplete. The Respondent, who bears the main burden of proof in respect of the Projects' costs, has presented as its key witness Mr. Figuera, who left the Projects so early that he could not offer to the Tribunal information based on personal knowledge of the factual background of the many cost items debated between the Parties. Witness Figuera provided about 5000 pages of cost documents he asked the Projects to compile; he did not proceed himself with the selection, nor did he provide any indexing404. The valuation experts from both sides take the defense of their respective clients in supporting their cost assumptions, not aware of how far away they are from reality. Despite the Respondent's repeated designation of Mr. Pati\u00f1o as its witness, the Tribunal recalls once again that Mr. Pati\u00f1o has been introduced into this proceeding as an expert; he cannot give testimony on facts and costs relating to the Projects. It is equally manifest that the Respondent cannot, before this Tribunal, characterize as testimony statements delivered by an individual appearing as a witness in another proceeding, even if the fact pattern in that case - the *Mobil* arbitrations - presents some resemblance to two of the Projects to be considered by this Tribunal405. The documentary evidence is based in part on projections dating from before the expropriation and disconnected from considering the potential of costs that may have characterized the historical life of the Projects, including the usual price increases occurring when business is flourishing and the economy growing. In addition, actual costs are very often alleged with poor documentary support.\n\nTR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2397:7-2398:1.\n\nCf. the Respondent's Cost Estimations in respect of Petrozuata, p. 15, 59/61, and for Hamaca, p. 16, 57, 86/88, where it is argued that documents on the record of this Tribunal are supported by the testimony of Mr. William Cline of Gaffney delivered in the *Mobil* arbitrations (R-550, R-551). The fact that Mr. Cline appeared in the *Mobil* arbitration as the Claimants' witness does not change the fact that he has not been introduced in this proceeding as a witness.\n\n616.\n\nFaced with the difficulties caused by evidence presented by pieces that cannot be put together to provide a clear picture, the Tribunal will consider the various cost items in determining first whether a specific claim for costs is valid as a matter of principle, and then examining whether the actual costs claimed are supported with reliable evidence showing that such costs did or may be incurred in the future in amounts that can be considered as realist and fair.\n\n617.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that costs represent claims the Respondent invokes in order to reduce the estimation of cash flow and ultimately the revenue accruing to the Projects' partners and the Claimants in this proceeding. Therefore, the Tribunal will not allocate costs that have not been claimed although it may appear as reasonably certain that they have occurred or may occur in the future.\n\n618.\n\nThe Parties adopted the usual distinction between Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenses (OPEX). The Tribunal follows the same order and the same categories that the Parties have adopted. The analysis of their respective positions is based on their briefs, including the evidence supplied, and on their respective cost assessments filed with the Tribunal on 20 March and on 2 June 2017.\n\n619.\n\nBoth Parties accept that the Composite Economic Model (CEM - LECG-085) serves as a plateau document from which to start. The Petrolera Ameriven Hamaca Economic Model (quoted either as AEM or as PAM) is equally important for that Project (LECG-129). The difference between the Parties consists in that the Claimants refer to these documents dated from the second half of 2006 exclusively (subject to yearly inflation), whereas the Respondent is (i) updating the figures contained therein to what it assumes as actual costs and (ii) adds further costs experienced in the Project's life but not yet projected in the CEM. The figures relating specifically to Hamaca are contained in the PAM. Those that are relevant for the Tribunal for the present examination also appear in the CEM, albeit sometimes with small and insignificant differences. The Tribunal refers primarily to the CEM with the effect that the rounding of numbers is the same for both Projects406.\n\nCf. CEM, p. 41-43/pdf (Petrozuata), 244-246/pdf (Hamaca).\n\nb. The difficulty to identify past and future costs\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n620.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the Claimants have certainly more difficulty than the Respondent in having access to pertinent information on actual costs. However, the Claimants have a well-known reputation in the oil industry and the expertise to provide useful information about costs attached to projects for oil production. They also know perfectly well that prices for expenses over the lifetime of a project, after having been retained in models in 2006, certainly will go up in the future. They also know that expenses may occur in the future that have not been and could not be modeled in 2006. They cannot rely on the 2006 models and tell the Tribunal that these assumptions were valid for 30 years, even if associated to future inflation indexes that are rarely accurate when compared to actual market values.\n\n621.\n\nThe Respondent is correct when it states that certain costs in the historical period should be excluded because they are related to the production and sale of blended oil, which was not allowed under the Association Agreements. However, the Tribunal also notes that the Respondent does not assist the Tribunal in identifying the portion of such costs that should be taken out of the overall cost-estimation. This is the case, for instance, for part of the costs for turnarounds. The Respondent accepts that this operation takes more time subsequent to the expropriation and since blending became permitted407. But the Respondent does not explain the cost-portion that should be removed from the turnaround budget based on the same experience and logic.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4569:14-22 (Preziosi), 4571:6-10 (King); Day 17, p. 4854:10-17 (Preziosi).\n\n622.\n\nIn relation to the update of amounts mentioned in the CEM to actual levels of costs, the Respondent uses inflation indexes and it relies on what it considers as the pertinent exchange rate. Both of these factors are applied to what is called a \"split\" between costs incurred in Venezuelan Bolivars and US dollars, in a proportion of 30:70% for CAPEX and the reverse proportion for OPEX. The Tribunal notes at the outset that these elements of accounting are approximate. There is no evidence upon the actual occurrence of this \"split\", whether in respect of several categories of costs or in respect of certain more specific items. Mr. Figuera provides these figures without any explanation or support on any documents or testimony408. Further, inflation rates applicable at the time in Venezuela are quoted but not supported by evidence. Moreover, such rates are applied to a great number of costs items without determining whether the 30%:70% split for Bolivars is of actual pertinence in respect of each item.\n\nCf. Figuera, Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 59.\n\n623.\n\nThe same observation applies to the split the Respondent and its valuation experts have made between portions of expenses incurred either in Bolivars or in US dollars. The documentary evidence available to the Respondent would undoubtedly allow identifying whether, and if so to what extent, such splitting did actually take place. Additionally, evidentiary support would also have revealed whether the 30:70 split adopted by the Respondent's experts did apply in this proportion throughout the whole period between 2007 and 2015 or 2016, or whether certain costs initially incurred in one of these currencies were not shifted towards expenses made in the other currency in case the inflation or other macroeconomic influences did render such shift advisable.\n\n624.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that a split that attributes to costs incurred in Bolivars a substantially higher percentage in OPEX than in CAPEX is reasonable given that the documents on the record suggest that a major portion of the costs related to OPEX were incurred in Venezuela in local currency. Indeed, when observing the division adopted in the 2006 models between the parts of certain cost items that are accounted for either in US$ or in Bolivars, it appears that for Petrozuata (unlike Hamaca) the Project's participants had modeled the applicable currency split differently409, sometimes adopting higher Bolivar portions than the 30% that have the preference of the Respondent in respect of CAPEX, sometimes counting with a greater portion than the 30% applicable to the US$ portion of OPEX. The Tribunal notes that different cost items had their individual cost split. It would be an almost impossible task to determine an exact split taking each item and subitem. However, the Respondent provides for a split410 that is not contested by the Claimants and that in the overall analysis of the available documentation appears as reasonable. Therefore, the Tribunal will adopt such a split.\n\nCf. CEM, p. 41-43/pdf (LECG-085).\n\nCf. Brailovsky & Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 154-181, 300-305.\n\n625.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that inflation indexes are reflecting impact on prices based on the currency to which they are tied up. The difficulty in the present matter results from the fact that a number of items on costs imply US$ and Bolivars, when these two currencies are applicable to specific parts of a same cost item. Therefore, to the extent that this is relevant, inflation must be determined separately for each currency. In this respect, the Tribunal approves the Respondent's position that the inflation occurring in Venezuela's market must be taken into consideration at its own rates when expenses in Bolivars are applicable. The Tribunal does not accept the inflation rates known on the US market that have been put forward by the Claimants' experts411.\n\nCf. Abdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, paras. 61/62, 153.\n\n626.\n\nThe Respondent introduces a further adjustment based on the assumption that 30% of total operating costs (OPEX) are variable, with the effect that the EHCO production projected by the CEM should be corrected by 30% based on the EHCO production volume estimated by the Respondent. This latter volume being lower, the corresponding OPEX should be reduced accord-ingly412. The Tribunal does not adopt the Respondent's position in respect of EHCO production, based on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's conclusions. Therefore, it does not follow the Respondent's and its experts' calculation based on this assumption.\n\nCf. Cost Estimation for Petrozuata, p. 14, 43/44, 48, 52/53, 56/57, and Hamaca, p. 15, 55, 59/60, 64/65, 69/70, 74; Brailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 308, 315. The Respondent refers to Witness Figuera, Testimony, 20 July 2009, footnotes 28, 31; Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, paras. 59, 97, where it is stated that 30% of OPEX are variable and related to the volume of CCO production.\n\n627.\n\nThe documentary evidence, if it had been filed with the Tribunal, would also have allowed to identify the applicable exchange rates. The record before the Tribunal contains a great number of invoices where the official rate was applied. When this was the conduct adopted within the Projects, one would expect the Claimants' valuation experts to demonstrate with convincing evidence that this conduct was actually inappropriate since it could be overturned. In this respect, the Claimants' experts offer nothing more than hypothetical submissions on the availability of more favorable rates through \"exchange rate management\"413. No demonstration is provided on how the experts' \"private manager\" would have optimized each cost item more favorably than the actual costs incurred. The experts had to admit that their reliance on the \"parallel market\" raises a legal issue414; they could not remove the objection of promoting illegal action on the black market415. The Tribunal does not agree with the Claimants when they argue that the Respondent was \"converting back\" into US$ expenses initially incurred in Bolivars and subject to Venezuelan inflation rates. The Tribunal understands that the Respondent has tied the Bolivar portion of a cost item to the local inflation rate (running since 2006, base year for the CEM), and added the resulting amount to the remaining US$ fraction in applying the pertinent exchange rate, both elements being included in its experts' CAPEX and OPEX inflation index.\n\nCf. Abdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, paras. 63/64, 148, 153-162. In their document serving as evidence rates are recorded, for Secad II, as from 24 March 2014, and for Simadi between 2 December 2015 and 3 July 2016 (CLEX-095); such presentation is manifestly incomplete and useless for an assessment to be made by the Tribunal.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 13, p. 3865:10-3866:15 (Abdala).\n\nCf. Respondent's 2017 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 171.\n\nc. Drilling\n-----------\n\n628.\n\nThe Tribunal takes this first item on the list of CAPEX, which is one of those matters where the lack of evidence and explanations is truly regrettable. The Respondent relies on the projections of Mr. Pati\u00f1o, including its splitting of drilling new wells and repairing existing wells year by year. The numbers he thus determined are linked to his conclusions on decline rate and other specificities that made him believe that both Projects will not successfully reach the targets for production of EHCO and CCO. The Tribunal's findings are that this approach is not appropriate and results in projections far removed from the real production and upgrading capacity of each of the Projects. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot take the numbers and their ventilation per year as a basis for determining the costs for drilling.\n\n629.\n\nThe Respondent's reliance on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's figures permits nonetheless the identification of the total number of wells to be drilled which have been retained by Mr. Pati\u00f1o on the basis of the initial projections reflected in Mr. Figuera's testimony. The Tribunal has explained that this total number of wells, as determined at the outset of the Projects, are very close, if not identical, to those that can be found in the 2006 models. In light of the Respondent's position as to the fixing of the costs of drilling, the Tribunal does not have to develop an approach of its own in providing for more wells to be drilled and to be accounted as CAPEX.\n\n630.\n\nThe Tribunal's preference would clearly be to rely on evidence of actual costs of drilling as experienced by the Projects. The Claimants are correct in assuming that such information would have permitted a more accurate assessment of the *ex post* valuation in this respect. The Tribunal will therefore have recourse to inflation rates in order to update costs for drilling to the best of its knowledge based on its record. It finds comfort for so proceeding in the position taken by both Parties, as the Claimants and the Respondent rely on inflation indexes to explain how costs are moving forward, albeit showing considerable disagreement in respect of the indexes to be taken as pertinent.\n\n631.\n\nThe Respondent's position is defined through a list of new wells, re-drills and replacement wells to be provided each year between 2007 and 2016416. For each year, the total amount of costs is given in US$. No specific evidence is mentioned, except the reference to Mr. Pati\u00f1o's conclusions417, which have been based on the instructions in respect of the well's decline he received and not on the true capacities of the Projects. The Respondent's valuation experts reproduce the same figures. They do not use Mr. Figuera's figures listed in his first Witness Statement418. On this basis, the Tribunal cannot reach any conclusion. Costs for new wells, repaired wells or re-drills are different for each category and need to be identified and translated in actual amounts. Costs for wells have been debated between the Parties, but no useful conclusion can be derived from this debate. On the other hand, the costs projected in 2006 have not been contested as they were retained at that time, but simply considered in need of updating to what can be accepted as correct in actual terms and for the future419. Therefore, the Tribunal will take the cost items for drilling as contained in the models and - in the absence of evidence on actual real costs - bring them forward through the relevant inflation indexes. In addition, the Tribunal notes that the same conclusion applies to costs for well repairs that the Respondent added to Petrozuata's and Hamaca's OPEX costs as a separate item, allegedly based on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's expertise although, manifestly, Mr. Pati\u00f1o's report does not contain such information, which would not be based on evidence anyhow. Well repair costs not being identified by evidence, they remain included in the costs for upstream based on the CEM from where the Respondent suggested to have them removed.\n\nCost Estimations for Petrozuata, p. 19, and Hamaca, p. 26.\n\nAppendices 81 and 84 (Appendices 89 and 90 are again not considered). Mr. Pati\u00f1o did not provide expertise on costs relating to wells; he makes comparisons of costs without giving numbers. He mentions that in the *Mobil* case, an expert told that repair of a well would cost US$ 360,000; cf. Expert Report, 18 August 2014, footnote 12; Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, footnotes 179, 306. This information relates to repair well only and it is unreliable and no evidence; the Respondent's experts use the same number, without further verification. The Respondent cannot allege well repair costs \"based on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's expert report\" (Cost Estimations for Petrozuata, p. 59, and Hamaca, 25/26); this report does not contain such information based on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's knowledge.\n\nTestimony, 20 July 2009, para. 29, p. 19.\n\nFor instance, an amount of US$ 3.5 million has been mentioned several times, but it remained unclear whether this sum includes just the drilling, or also separate equipment, roads and well pads. Cf. Witness Lyons, TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 5, p. 1195:15-1197:17; 2017 February Hearing, Day 7, p. 1959:15-1961:11.\n\n632.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the initial selection of each year's portion of new wells or replacement wells is uncertain. In the absence of evidence on the real sequence of drilling during the historical period, which only the Respondent could provide, the projections of 2006 are nevertheless a good indicator about the moving forward of the wells setting, which is at the basis of the EHCO production for the years following the expropriation. A simple addition of a total of numbers of wells drilled over the life-time of the Project and then recalculated by averages per year appears considerably more uncertain than the sequence of drilling as projected in 2006. In respect of Pet-rozuata, a further element of confirmation can be added: the sequence of drillings presented in the CEM corresponds for years 2011 to 2022 exactly to the numbers of wells to be added as they were presented by Mr. Figuera in his first Witness Statement. A big difference appears for year 2023, but the Tribunal will not retain drilling costs in that year, immediately before the Project's production drops seriously. For the years 2007 to 2010, the Tribunal will retain the figures of the CEM. In light of the convincing presentation in the CEM for Petrozuata, the Tribunal will also retain the corresponding figures for Hamaca. For purposes of this calculation, the Tribunal has applied the split between Bolivars and US dollars as pertinent at the time, by using the CAPEX inflation index applicable to each currency.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Costs for Drilling |\n|  | Petrozuata | Hamaca |\n|  | CEM | CAPEX inflation index | US$ MM total | CEM | CAPEX inflation index | US$ MM total |\n| 2007 \u00bd | 49,100 | 1.19 | 58,429 | 7,977 | 1.19 | 9,493 |\n| 2008 | 54,011 | 1.42 | 76,696 | 60,259 | 1.42 | 85,568 |\n| 2009 | 55,281 | 1.49 | 82,369 | 53,432 | 1.49 | 79,614 |\n| 2010 | 43,718 | 1.28 | 55,959 | 7,001 | 1.28 | 8,961 |\n| 2011 | 33,135 | 1.45 | 48,046 | 36,237 | 1.45 | 52,544 |\n| 2012 | 46,312 | 1.59 | 73,636 | 58,473 | 1.59 | 92,972 |\n| 2013 | 50,480 | 1.56 | 78,749 | 65,665 | 1.56 | 102,437 |\n| 2014 | 47,137 | 1.89 | 89,089 | 68,980 | 1.89 | 130,372 |\n| 2015 | 48,748 | 2.70 | 131,620 | 59,367 | 2.70 | 160,291 |\n| 2016 | 55,085 | 1.03 | 56,738 | 43,050 | 1.03 | 44,342 |\n| 2017 | 45,888 | 1.53 | 70,209 | 55,729 | 1.53 | 85,265 |\n| 2018 | 55,334 | 1.33 | 73,594 | 60,291 | 1.33 | 80,187 |\n| 2019 | 59,501 | 1.32 | 78,541 | 38,515 | 1.32 | 50,840 |\n| 2020 | 62,234 | 1.33 | 82,771 | 42,060 | 1.33 | 55,940 |\n| 2021 | 78,581 | 1.34 | 105,299 | 40,085 | 1.34 | 53,714 |\n| 2022 | 88,033 | 1.36 | 119,725 | 55,784 | 1.36 | 75,866 |\n| 2023 | 0 |  | 0 | 61,975 | 1.39 | 86,145 |\n| 2024 | 0 |  | 0 | 67,525 | 1.41 | 95,210 |\n| 2025 | 0 |  | 0 | 67,405 | 1.43 | 96,389 |\n| 2026 | 0 |  | 0 | 70,455 | 1.46 | 102,864 |\n| 2027 |  |  |  | 147,615 | 1.48 | 218,470 |\n| 2028 |  |  |  | 70,500 | 1.51 | 106,455 |\n| 2029 |  |  |  | 69,010 | 1.53 | 105,585 |\n| 2030 |  |  |  | 66,890 | 1.56 | 104,348 |\n| 2031 |  |  |  | 20,795 | 1.59 | 33,064 |\n| 2032 |  |  |  | 0 |  | 0 |\n| 2033 |  |  |  | 0 |  | 0 |\n| 2034 |  |  |  | 0 |  | 0 |\n| 2035 |  |  |  | 0 |  | 0 |\n| 2036 |  |  |  | 0 |  | 0 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n\nd. Turnarounds\n--------------\n\n633.\n\nThe Respondent states rightly that post-nationalization turnarounds were more expensive than those operated before the nationalization, and in particular the small sized turnarounds in the first years of the Projects. The reason for this is not only based on price increases. The other and maybe more important reason is the significant increase in the number of equipment items that were examined.\n\n634.\n\nNonetheless, the Respondent cannot simply state that the Projects would have had higher costs if no nationalization had occurred. The comparisons that the Respondent offers with other sites are interesting but not conclusive as long as they are not accompanied by information about the size of the site, the actual duration of the turnarounds, the volumes of EHCO and CCO treated and many other factors necessary to render such analysis useful. The Respondent added to the uncertainty when submitting that since 2009, turnarounds needed more time, basically 60 days, when the Projects produced significant volumes of blended oil420. The Respondent did not specify the period of time that was added for this reason. The impact on costs has not been measured. Nonetheless, such a fact cannot be ignored by the Tribunal.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 4854:10-17 (Preziosi). The record contains almost no information in this respect. Together with its Reply of 31 July 2017, the Respondent submitted an Annex 9 relating to the PetroPiar Turnaround of 2009, explaining the handling of tanks for the simultaneous production of Merey and Commercial crude (Question 3).\n\n635.\n\nThe Respondent insists that the Hamaca turnarounds operated by the mixed companies were unsuccessful because they did not improve the OSF. In light of the undisputed objective of increasing OSF of any turnaround, one may wonder how costs can be claimed by the Respondent who is asserting simultaneously that those turnarounds have not reached their purpose. The Respondent's position is manifestly inconsistent. The Respondent's claim for turnaround costs does make sense only under the assumption that the turnaround's purpose of improving the OSF has been fulfilled, and that this reflects the actual situation - contrary to the Respondent's unsupported assertion of low OSFs resulting from the turnarounds conducted during the historical period.\n\n636.\n\nThe model sequence of regular turnarounds was every five years for Petrozuata and every four years for Hamaca421. This was a rule that could suffer derogations. For Petrozuata, the turnaround coming after 2011422 would have been in 2015 but was deferred to 2016 and ultimately did not happen423. For Hamaca, the turnaround of 2009424 was followed by a PRAC in 2012425, and was thus scheduled for 2016, but equally differed. For both Projects, there is no schedule fixing dates for the next turnarounds. In light of these delays, it seems unlikely that the Claimants' schedule for future turnarounds (based on the CEM) for Petrozuata (2019, 2024) and Hamaca (2020, 2024, 2028, 2032) will become the real timeline426. The Respondent's dates are the same for Hamaca, whereas only one turnaround is scheduled for Petrozuata (2020)427. Given the unclear timing of turnarounds and the equally uncertain background of macroeconomic events that may have an influence on the taking of such an important decision to operate a turnaround, the Tribunal cannot allocate costs for turnarounds to any specific date or year, nor is it possible to refer to any specific inflation factor or exchange rate.\n\nCf. CEM, p. 41-43/pdf (Petrozuata), p. 244-246/pdf (Hamaca); TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 13, p. 3758:203759:1 (Spiller).\n\nFiguera Appendix 46, PetroAnzo\u00e1tegui, Turnaround Report October 2011, 31 March 2012.\n\nWitness Figuera, TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2401:13-2402:11; TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 4868:10-4869:2 (Preziosi).\n\nFiguera Appendix 76, Final Report on PetroPiar's 2009 Turnaround, 21 September 2010 (also C-584). This turnaround was initially planned for 2008; cf. Figuera, Supplemental Testimony, 26 January 2010, footnote 203; Lyons, Fifth Witness Statement, 13 October 2014, para. 30; Second Witness Statement, 30 October 2009, para. 48.\n\nFiguera Appendix 46, Final Report of the 2012 PRAC, August 2013.\n\nClaimants' Reply of 10 July 2017, p. 21 (Question 15); cf. also the debate with Counsel in TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 4872:20-4878:21.\n\nCf. Respondent's Answers of 10 July 2017, p. 24-26 (Question 15).\n\n637.\n\nThe record makes it very difficult to determine the number of days required for each turnaround. The 2011 turnaround at Petrozuata took 67 days, whereas 52 days had been estimated428. At Hamaca, the 2008 turnaround was scheduled for 48 days, and 36 days were envisaged in subsequent years429. The 2009 turnaround (October - early December) was completed in 55 days, whereas 49 days were planned430. The 2012 PRAC was planned for 45 days, but lasted 82 days431. These indications imply considerable uncertainty, which is compounded by the fact that the extensive actual blending renders turnovers longer. Based on the evidence in the record the Tribunal considers that 40 days would be a reasonable average duration for a turnover conducted under the operational scheme of the Association Agreements.\n\nFiguera Appendix 82, Petroanzo\u00e1tegui Upgrader Turnaround Report, 21 October 2012, p. 1.\n\n2007 Budget Presentation, 12 September 2006, p. 3.\n\nFiguera Appendix 76, Final Report on PetroPiar's 2009 Turnaround, 21 September 2010, p. 5.\n\nFiguera Appendix 46, PetroPiar, 2012 Final Report on PRAC, August 2013, p. 13.\n\n638.\n\nA further uncertainty results from the determination of the costs for turnarounds. For instance, the Respondent explained that the total costs for the 2012 PetroPiar PRAC was noted, not only in the final report on this operation, but also in the PetroPiar 2012 Audited Financial State-ment432. The amount of US$ 313 million can indeed be found in this statement433, in a text that reads as follows:\n\nDurante el a\u00f1o terminado el 31 de diciembre de 2012, las adiciones a las obras en progreso comprenden, principalmente, el costo de ejecuci\u00f3n de los proyectos de perforaci\u00f3n y completaci\u00f3n de pozos de desarrollo, y construcci\u00f3n de facilidades por $334,950 miles (Bs1,440,283 miles) y proyectos asociados al mejorador por $439,068 miles (Bs1,887,988 miles), dentro los que se incluyen desembolsos relacionados con el PRAC por, aproximadamente, $313,000 miles (Bs1,345,900 miles).\n\nThe term \"incluyen\" and the numbers explain the accounting. The costs for the PRAC were included in the \"proyectos asociados al mejorador\". The respective amount of MUS$ 439,068, added to the costs for drilling and related items set at MUS$ 334,950, result in the total of MUS$ 774,018 that is recorded in the account \"Obras in proceso\" for 2012 in the US$ section, and with the number of 3,328,271 in the Bolivar part434. In other words, the accounting did include the costs for PRAC in the overall figure for costs related to the upgrader, with the effect that the costs for the upgrader and the PRAC would not have exceeded the sum of MUS$ 439,068. The Respondent, on the other hand, accounted for both elements separately, and took the upgrader cost from the CEM (*i.e.* MUS$ 249,614) combined with the inflation index (*i.e.* MUS$ 285,259), resulting together with the PRAC (US$ 313 million) in a combined total of MUS$ 598,459. While the conclusion to be drawn from this observation may be uncertain at a more general level, the fact that is certain is that the numbers presented for the costs for turnaround (CAPEX) and Upgrader (OPEX) in the Respondent's Cost Estimation for Hamaca for the year 2012 are partially overlapping, in an amount of MUS$ 159,391, on the basis of the Financial Statement for that year.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 151 and footnote 241.\n\nCLEX-94, p. 236/pdf; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 15, p. 4474:17-20 (Kahale).\n\nCLEX-094, p. 234/235(pdf).\n\n639.\n\nThe Parties are at odds about the acceptable amounts for costs of past turnarounds in the historical period and in respect of costs to be projected for future turnarounds. The usual course of a turnaround was to overturn prior cost estimations. The Petrozuata turnaround of 2011 had a budget of 597.7 MMBs, but finally needed 1110 MMBs435. The turnaround projected for 2015 was estimated at US$ 350 million436. The Hamaca 2009 turnaround had actual costs of 223.7 MMUS$, whereas 210 MMUS$ were budgeted437. The PRAC 2012 was estimated at 225 MMUS$, but ultimately needed 313 US$ million438. The Tribunal finds the evidence scarce439. In addition, blending made the turnarounds longer; the Tribunal is faced with the unresolved problem of converting this fact into its cost assessment.\n\nFiguera Appendix 82, PetroAnzo\u00e1tegui Upgrader Turnaround Report, 21 October 2012, p. 1, 7, 24, 29. At an exchange rate of 4.3, the total amount would be US$ 258 million. However, the Respondent claims US$ 236 million, based on Witness Figuera, Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 97, p. 69, also reported in Cost Estimation for Petrozuata, p. 33; Brailovsky/Flores Appendix 406, CAPEX (PZ). The pertinent amount has not been identified in the Financial Statements (CLEX-093).\n\nWitness Figuera, TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2402:12-2403:16, 2411:8/9.\n\nFiguera Appendix 76, Final Report on PetroPirars' 2009 Turnaround, 21 September 2010, p. 5, 65.\n\nFiguera Appendix 46, PetroPiar, 2012 Final Report on PRAC, August 2013, p. 6, 59, 81, 113/pdf.\n\nThe Claimants' expert Mr. Earnest (Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016) observed that Mr. Figuera's expected maintenance expenditure did \"greatly exceed\" that required by a competent operator (para. 86), that the cost of US$ 335 million for Petrozuata's 2015 turnaround was \"unreasonably high\" (para. 88), and, in conclusion, that the costs provided in Mr. Figuera's testimony are \"highly excessive\" and are \"unreliable\" (para. 93).\n\n640.\n\nThe Tribunal will use as guidance the actual costs submitted through the reports on the Tribunal's record. Under the circumstances, it appears impossible to assume a specific currency split440. In respect of the costs for the 2012 PetroPiar PRAC, the Tribunal reduces the claimed amount of US$ 313 million by MUS$ 159,391, thus deducting the double payment claimed by the Respondent on the basis of the inflated amount taken from the CEM (MUS$ 285,259) added to the costs for the 2012 PRAC, which is overstated in light of the 2012 Financial Statement that records an overall expense for the upgrader of MUS$ 439,068, including the costs for the PRAC.\n\nA division of 50:50% between Bolivars and US$ has been noted but remained uncertain in light of the absence of documentary evidence and the impossibility to determine the actual dates. Cf. TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 12, p. 3530:14-21(Kahale, Spiller), 3533:1/2 (Kahale).\n\n641.\n\nWith respect to future turnarounds, the Tribunal is faced with two opposing positions, the Claimants referring to the model figures of the CEM, and the Respondent claiming never ending increases of prices. The financial projections for turnarounds in 2015441 and 2016442 seem excessive and in any event not supported by evidence of any weight or explanations. Overlaps with the accounting position devoted to upgrader maintenance are in the Tribunal's mind in light of the experience with the 2012 PetroPiar PRAC. The Tribunal retains as a reasonable prognostic the amount of US$ 300 million per turnaround (or PRAC), divided in equal parts per year over a period of four years until the end of each Project's lifetime (respectively a reasonable point in time before the cessation of production). Assuming for each Project a turnaround in 2018, the Tribunal finds that no more turnaround can be reasonably ascertained at Petrozuata before the Project is faced with a severe drop in 2023, whereas for Hamaca, there remains an expectation for two further turnarounds or PRACs after the one expected in 2018.\n\nRespondent's Cost Estimation for Petrozuata, p. 33: US$ 457,576,000. A budget plan provided for an expense of 1,118.81 MM US$; C-571; Earnest, Technical Assessment of the Hamaca and Petrozuata Upgrader Performance, 13 October 2014, Exhibit 04. Cf. TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 10, p. 2926:13-2931:17 (discussing with Mr. Earnest the impact of exchange rate). The final work list of the 2015 Petrozuata turnaround does not allow any conclusions in respect of costs (cf. Figuera Appendix 141).\n\nRespondent's Cost Estimation for Hamaca, p. 42: US$ 512,913,000.\n\ne. Other CAPEX and OPEX based on the CEM\n----------------------------------------\n\n642.\n\nThe Tribunal will not repeat what it has already said about inflation and exchange rate. The Tribunal now addresses, in respect of Petrozuata, CAPEX Upstream Facilities, Upgrader Facilities and G&A, and for Hamaca, the CAPEX items pertaining to the same categories as Upstream Facilities, Upgrader Facilities443, G&G (Exploration) and G&A (General and Administrative).\n\nSubject to the 2008 removal of US$ 30 MM for work to be done at the coker unit.\n\n643.\n\nIn these matters, as explained above, the Tribunal will retain the numbers projected in the CEM, to which neither Party objected, and then apply the exchange rate and the combined inflation rate suggested by the Respondent. The resulting figures will be listed further below.\n\n644.\n\nThe same methodology applies to the comparable costs item in the category of OPEX, with one important difference. The Parties basically rely again on the bottom figures contained in the CEM, in the case of Petrozuata in respect of Upstream, Upgrader, G&A, plus \"Third Party\", whereas the same categories are retained for Hamaca, to the exception of \"Third Party\" and the addition of \"Marketing\". The Tribunal accepts that the impact of inflation in respect of the Bolivar portion of costs is based on the pertinent Venezuelan inflation rate, but in reversing the proportion between the two currencies, taking for OPEX 70% Bolivars and US$ 30%. The Tribunal notes that the OPEX inflation rate is slightly different from the CAPEX inflation rate, these categories reacting not in identical proportions to the impact of moving oil prices444. The Claimants have no further objection in this respect, as this has been discussed above, and they do not challenge the numbers used by the Respondent and its experts. The resulting figures will be listed further below.\n\nCf. Cost Estimation Petrozuata, p. 41.\n\n645.\n\nThe Respondent added another correction to OPEX in assuming EHCO volumes based on real terms for 2007 and 2008 and for later years on the projections prepared by Mr. Pati\u00f1o and then adjusting 30% of OPEX accordingly445. EHCO production listed in Mr. Parti\u00f1o's conclusions is based on pure speculations and cannot impact costs assessment in any way. Moreover, the Respondent does not explain why such adjustment should be limited to a 30% portion of OPEX.\n\nCf. *ibidem*, p. 43/44, 48, 52/53, 56/57.\n\n646.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls the evidence that cost assessments having an impact on the Claimants' revenue and their damage claims can relate to events occurring since the taking only, which is later than 26 June 2007 (or, for practical reasons, 1 July 2007). The Respondent has submitted cost claims for CAPEX at Petrozuata where the amount refers to the full year 2007446. Such amounts must be divided by half.\n\nCf. *ibidem*, p. 24 (G&A), 27 (Upstream Facilities), 30 (Upgrader Facilities).\n\nf. Additional CAPEX and OPEX\n----------------------------\n\n647.\n\nFor Petrozuata, the item \"Others\" under CAPEX consists of two elements, (i) firefighting, and (ii) fire repairs and restoration of solid handlings facility. The relevant costs had not been contemplated in 2006. However, the Claimants cannot object to costs that were not foreseen but that are closely related to the Projects in such a way that they appear as consequences that are in a range of events to be expected within a carefully operated Project.\n\n648.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that improving *firefighting* systems in the years 2012 to 2014 is a normal occurrence in the oil industry and that even in cases where the costs exceeded the minimum required, such costs are reasonably connected to the Project and must be supported by its partners. This is equally true even when it cannot be demonstrated that such expense was required by an insurer447. The Tribunal takes the total expense of US$ 10,732,625 as established on the basis of the set of contractual documents and the proforma invoices submitted448. However, the division between the three years concerned is unclear and not explained. The Tribunal will thus proceed in splitting the total amount in three equal parts over the years 2012 to 2014.\n\nAs this was objected by the Claimants (Cost Estimation Petrozuata, p. 38) and Mr. Earnest, Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 112/113.\n\nFiguera Appendix 148; Cost Estimation for Petrozuata, Annex I. An additional improvement of the firefighting system had been forecasted in July 2014 at US$ 100 million, an amount that is not included in the Cost Estimation (cf. Figuera, Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 97; Appendix 83).\n\n649.\n\nAs regards the *fire repairs and restoration of solid handlings facility,* the Tribunal observes that this cost item has allegedly been caused by a fire in that facility, which was undoubtedly an accidental and abnormal event, not to be expected in the normal course of such business. It has first to be noted that the restoration of the facility is presented as a separate opportunity cost449; it is thus not connected necessarily to the fire, but appears to have been a good occasion when the consequences of the fire had to be remedied. The invoices relating to the restoration of the facility are all dated 2012 or 2013450, more than three years after the fire occurred in early 2009451. This portion of the cost item can therefore not be retained by the Tribunal, as there is no proof that such costs had been caused by the fire and would have been part of a but-for world scenario.\n\nCost Estimation for Petrozuata, Annex III, listing the invoices contained in Figuera, Appendix 146.\n\n*Ibidem*.\n\nNo precise date is on the Tribunal's record. The first contract providing for reparation of the facility was signed on 8 January 2009; cf. Figuera Appendix 142. Counsel of the Respondent confirmed that it was in early 2009; TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4726:20-4727:2 (Preziosi).\n\n650.\n\nThe accidental nature of that fire demonstrates that there can be no connection to any potential future involvement of ConocoPhillips in the Project after June 2007. Moreover, it is far from certain that the actual Project's governance was immune from any obligation of its own to cover the repair costs. From the alleged total costs of about US$ 49 million, only US$ 11 million were covered by insurance452. No evidence has been provided that would explain why the insurance did not cover a higher amount and whether such consequence resulted from the contractual framework. In addition, no explanation has been provided that would assist the Tribunal in understanding the division of costs on fire repair and restoration relating both to the same facility. A further debate before the Tribunal demonstrated the lack of evidence and the poor information available with respect to the sequence of events and their interrelation453. For all these reasons, the Tribunal does not accept the cost item on fire repairs and restoration of the solid handling facility.\n\nCost Estimation for Petrozuata, Annex II. Contractual documents and invoices are supplied in Figuera Appendix 142, without explanation. See also the Respondent's Answers of 10 July 2017, p. 19 (Question 11), and the table attached to Mr. Earnest's Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, Exhibit 10. Doubts about the seriousness of the work undertaken emerge when reading the governmental inspection report on the Orinoco Oil Belt dated 31 July 2015, p. 29 (C-649).\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4709:12-4736:19.\n\n651.\n\nThe Respondent did not provide clear information about the insurance coverage of the Projects. It was said that the available insurance did not cover damages to property. No evidence has been presented on this point, nor does the record contain documentary evidence in respect of insurance policies, requests for payment by the insurance company, invoices, etc. The Hamaca Association Agreement (C-22) provided in Article 8.8 that insurance shall be procured and maintained to cover, among others, property, control of well, liability, in such a way that reinsurance is made available454. The Petrozuata Offering Circular of 1997 stated that the Company will be obligated to maintain insurance customary for this type of project, including business interruption insurance and property insurance, covering all risks of physical damage or loss (C-75, p. 26, 51, 89/90). The Tribunal notes that the Hamaca Board meeting approved in 2006 liability insurance for claims relating to product liability (with an indemnity limit of 100 US$ million) and damages, and property damage and business interruption insurance, covering direct physical loss or damage all risks (for an indemnity limit of US$ 950 million)455. Some Financial Statements recorded expenses for insurance456. It may be assumed that the situation was not significantly different for Petrozuata. In light of this information, the burden would have been on the Respondent to demonstrate that such insurance either was not effectively concluded or did not cover more than the amount of US$ 11 million. The lack of evidence on insurance coverage affects various other alleged costs that *prima facie* would be eligible for coverage by insurance.\n\nMore detailed provisions are then to be found in Article 11 of the Operating Agreement under Annex F, providing that the types of insurance shall cover all risk physical damage to all real and personal property of every kind (III), any coverage to be understood as primary insurance (V).\n\nFiguera Appendix 25, Hamaca Board of Directors Meeting, 18 May 2006, p. 11/12.\n\nCf., Hamaca/PetroPiar Financial Statements (CLEX-094) for the years 2009 and 2010 (p. 151/pdf), 2012 (p. 298/pdf), 2013 (p. 298/299/pdf), for amounts between US$ 3,691 and 7,112 million.\n\n652.\n\nThe Respondent submits in connection with the solid handling facility a further item covering an important amount of costs in respect of \"*trucking*\". It explains that the operational difficulties and the unavailability of the solids handling facility had the effect of requiring solids -mostly coke - to be transported away on a huge pile, which involved a great number of trucks and workers for a certain number of years. The Respondent explains that this was the consequence of the need to restore the facility and thus ultimately the result of the fire that had happened in 2009.\n\n653.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the factual occurrence of these events raises more doubts about the relationship the Respondent asserts between these three key elements: fire - restoration of the facility - need for trucking coke away. When the facility was damaged by fire in early 2009, it took the Project more than five months to sign the first contract relating to the coke transport457. At that time, the facility had become available, because basic repairs were done after three months458. The trucking began in 2009, but it was not intensified before 2011, and lasted until 2014. This results from the amounts of costs in US$ listed by the Respondent and supported by stacks of invoices supplied by Mr. Figuera without explanation: 13,328,992 (2009), 3,001,293 (2010), 35,322,929 (2011), 96,351,310 (2012), 64,466,776 (2013), 66,784,443 (2014)459 - resulting in a total of US$ 279,255,742. These numbers show that more than 90% of the costs for trucking relate to the years 2011 to 2014. This demonstrates that the investment in trucking coke was not caused by the fire and the restoration of the solids handling facility. It had other logistical reasons that have nothing to do with the operational scheme based on the Association Agreements and the but-for scenario. If the facility needed further repair, one would expect the associated costs claimed, such as the US$ 203 million budgeted for the modernization and expansion of the facility460. This has not been done.\n\nContract dated 18 June 2009; cf. Figuera Appendix 143. In the Respondent's Cost Estimations, the first contract was dated 4 September 2009 (Hamaca, Annex VIII), respectively 18 November 2009 (Petrozuata, Annex IV).\n\nRespondent's Answers of 10 July 2017, p. 18 (Question 11). The loss of opportunities report noted an unavailability of the facility for August 2009; cf. Figuera Appendix 73, p. 10/pdf. Witness Figuera could not confirm that the reparation of the solid handling facility had ever been completed: TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 8, p. 2425:17-2426:9.\n\nCf. Cost Estimation for Petrozuata, Annex IV. The invoices for 2009-2014 are mostly contained in Figuera Appendix 143, whereas part of invoices relating to 2014 are said to be contained in Figuera Appendix 172 that has not been produced before this Tribunal. See further Cost Estimation for Hamaca, Annex VIII, and Figuera Appendix 144. Another list of contracts supplied by PDVSA and included in the Claimants' file (C-572) notes a total amount of US$ 4.2 million for trucking between 2009 and 2014.\n\nCf. Figuera, Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 71/72; Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, para. 65.\n\n654.\n\nThe Tribunal simply recalls that it rejected above a cost item the Respondent isolated for \"*well repairs*\" as OPEX that is not based on any evidence on the Tribunal's record; Mr. Pati\u00f1o relies, without any further verification, on the statement of another individual, who appeared as a witness in the *Mobil* arbitration.\n\n655.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that although a number of financial statements are on its record (CLEX-093), the Respondent declared that it does not rely on them461. These statements cover the period between July 2007 to 2008 and 2011 to 2014. The Respondent explains that statements for the years 2009-2010 were not available because as from 1 January 2009, Petrozuata had its assets and related risks transferred to PDVSA. Nonetheless, this is not an argument sufficient to consider unreliable any information that may have been gathered on PDVSA's financial statements. In any event, the figures the Respondent mentions in its Cost Estimations as representing the financial statements are so massively divergent from the amounts of costs the Respondent claims in this proceeding that they can hardly constitute evidence for this proceeding462. The Respondent's Counsel declared to the Tribunal that the financial statement constitute evidence in support of expenses of the Projects463; he relied on these accounts on several occasions464. This position appears inconsistent with the Respondent's declaration made in its Cost Estimations.\n\nCost Estimation for Petrozuata, cover page, last footnote.\n\nCf. *ibidem*, cover page and table, p. 67-75.\n\nTR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 18, p. 5277:18/19, 5301:15-21 (Kahale).\n\nCf., for instance, TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 12, p. 3516:3-14, 3540:20-3541:5; Day 15, p. 4474:17-20, 4475:19-4476:2 (Kahale); 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4695:22-4696:3, 4698:1-5 (Preziosi), 4705:15/16 (Kahale); all in relation to costs for turnarounds and PRACs.\n\n656.\n\nFor Hamaca, the Respondent lists several additional cost items, the first of which relates to an *electricity generating equipment* in the amount of US$ 94,800,000 in 2010. It is not disputed that this expense stems from a governmental decree requiring PDVSA and its affiliates to establish and use independent generation capacity so that they will no longer depend on the national electricity providers465. Such a governmental decision has been in the range of measures to be expected on a project such as Hamaca. The Claimants do not oppose the need to acquire such equipment. Their criticism addresses the amount of the expense and the omission to indicate a corresponding reduction in the costs of purchasing electricity from the national grid. The Respondent does not answer the second remark, and it does not comment on either the effect that such new electricity supply must have had on the increase in efficiency following the reduction in power failures, together with the impact on the OSF.\n\nCf. Decree No. 6,992 dated 21 October 2009 (Figuera, Appendix 69).\n\n657.\n\nThe Claimants' expert Mr. Earnest submits that the claimed costs are two or three times too high, all the more so as the financial benefits that self-generation provides are not discounted466. He submitted industry reports on power generators (Exhibits 12/13). However, he did not go further than raising doubts about the size of the electricity capacity acquired and the price paid. He does not submit that the equipment actually purchased was useless in any respect or manifestly overpriced. He does not provide even an idea about the decrease in costs in downstream facilities that may have been obtained. The Tribunal accepts that there may have been better opportunities to buy electricity generators for lower prices and capacities more closely tied to the needs of the upgrader. However, the Tribunal also finds that there is a margin of business decision making where it appears inappropriate to claim for better products and lower prices years after the purchase has been made, certainly on the professional advice available to all partners of the mixed company467. Therefore, the Tribunal retains the amount of US$ 94,560,000 invoiced in 2010, together with an additional amount of US$ 277,725 in 2011.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 28, 121, 125/126. Another expert noted that costs of buying electricity from third parties should have been deducted: TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 13, p. 3827:8-13 (Abdala).\n\nCf. Figuera, Appendices 138-140.\n\n658.\n\nThe Respondent introduces in \"Others\" an amount of US$ 5,600,000 for an *EOR assessment* made in 2015468. The complete lack of evidence is sufficient to explain that the Tribunal will not retain this item. Moreover, it seems confusing to see the Respondent accepting attempts for EOR in the but-for scenario, when it had so strongly argued that steam injection and any comparable new extraction technique could not be envisaged in the framework of the Association Agreements.\n\nCost Estimation for Hamaca, p. 49. The Respondent referred to a statement made by Mr. Figuera in the ICC arbitration; TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4658:16-4660:6, 4672:20-4673:11. No documentary evidence is on this Tribunal's record. In any event, Mr. Figuera did not have personal knowledge about the recent use of EOR.\n\n659.\n\nDifficulties with the vibrations at the *Coker Unit* were well known before the expropriation469. It is equally not disputed that various attempts to resolve the problem failed and that at the critical time in 2007 and even thereafter, no advise was convincing and offering a final solution. The PAM included an amount of US$ 30 million for 2008 relating to the coker unit, however not provided with further explanation. The Respondent deducted this amount and claims instead costs for the installation of braces and other repair attempts at the coker unit for US$ 11,514,000 through 2014, and US$ 8,954,000 in 2015. The Tribunal cannot follow the Respondent when it takes the US$ 30 million forward into the costs for 2008, appropriately inflated, whereas the expense had not been made. This amount was not used; it must be removed from the list of costs. Instead, the two other amounts mentioned above correspond allegedly to actual expenses. The amount of US$ 11,514,000 is composed of a long list of amounts supported by invoices, in Annex I of the Cost Estimation for Hamaca. These invoices are said to represent a \"total through 2014\". In fact, they cover dates from June 2007 until December 2011. In the explanation provided by the Respondent, the total of US$ 11.5 million is for the period 2005-2014 (p. 51), which is manifestly not what results from the dates given for the invoices. Finally, the second amount of US$ 8.9 million is supported by a purchase order and a contract, not on this Tribunal's record, and it is said to relate to 2015 (p. 51). This Tribunal cannot approve this last amount, for lack of evidence and in light of missing explanation of the need for such substantial expense when between 2013 and 2014 apparently nothing, or very little, has been undertaken. In February 2013, an engineering study was made by Chevron Energy Technology Company, concluding that \"the application of dampers under the current conditions was judged not practical\", and that \"proceeding with this option is not practi-cal\"470. No further clarification about the fate of this report and the coker unit has been brought before the Tribunal471.\n\nSee the proposal for remedy by Foster Wheeler of 19 December 2006, Figuera Appendix 71.\n\nFiguera Appendix 72, p. 9, 25.\n\nThe Respondent noted that the attempts led by Chevron in 2012 and 2015 were unsuccessful; cf. Cost Estimation for Hamaca, p. 51. No evidence was added to this statement. Witness Figuera noted that the sheer walls remain to be built: TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3161:22, 3166:20-22, 3168:11-3169:4.\n\n660.\n\nOn the basis of the Tribunal's record, it cannot be denied that the coker unit was a serious problem that was in need of a solution472. It was not only known, but it was also generally considered as difficult to be remedied. Therefore, there must have been a margin of expenses that did not lead to successful reparation, with which the Claimants would also have been confronted with in a but-for scenario. The Claimants have the experience from the years 2005 to 2007 when the coker already caused problems. One would therefore expect that they would be able to scrutinize in detail the numerous invoices supplied by Mr. Figuera473. They are capable, if need be, of saying more than simply that the alleged coker repair costs \"are not sufficiently substantiated\" (p. 50). The Tribunal notes that the revision of the coker unit was a recurrent item at any turnaround. Costs identified as specifically related to such work may in fact have been counted as well in the budget for the 2009 turnaround474 and the 2012 PRAC475. The Respondent could not dispel serious doubts in this respect. Therefore, the Tribunal deducts from the alleged costs for 2007 to 2012 a total of US$ 3,047,456 that it understands as representing work on the coker unit that was done during the 2009 turnaround and therefore most probably included in its budget476. The remaining costs to be retained for July 2007 until the end of 2011 are thus US$ 8,467,002, allocated for each year in appropriate proportions. Thereafter, the Claimants are no longer involved in a but-for scenario perspective. It has been convincingly shown that Chevron, actual partner of the mixed company, is the principal actor in resolving this issue, based on its February 2013 report477.\n\nWitness Figuera explained that the problem did not consist in a current reduction of productivity and had no impact on the OSF, but it implied a potential loss of production in the event of an adverse incident; the vibration problem was a risk factor (Supplemental Testimony, 26 January 2010, paras. 90, 96; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3162:10-14). Probability calculations have been made by the Respondent's experts, which had no relation to reality (TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 12, p. 3628:2-3635:11, 3642:13-16; cf., for an analysis, Earnest, Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 38-42); the Respondent did not share its own experts' methodology (cf. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 276).\n\nAppendix 121.\n\nA report of a technical team noted in January 2009 that flanges were successfully replaced, but that metal cracks remained to be repaired and a further inspection to be made at the forthcoming turnaround (p. 45-49). Annex 10 filed with Respondent's Reply of 31 July 2017 (Question 3). Prior to this, a Coker Structure Vibration Project has been prepared in April 2007, with the aim of making efforts as soon as possible but not later than the plant shutdown in August 2008 (C-382); but this turnaround was then differed to 2009: Lyons, Fifth Witness Statement, 13 October 2014, para. 30; Second Witness Statement, 30 October 2009, para. 48. Counsel of the Respondent told the Tribunal that nothing could be found in the turnaround reports about the coker vibration issue; TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4630:15-4632:6 (Preziosi). This seems not convincing in light of those parts of the report that address specifically the coker items concerned by the vibration defect (p. 8/9).\n\nCoker equipment 12-V-001 to 004 was part of the repaired equipment during the 2012 PRAC. Figuera Appendix 46, PetroPiar, 2012 Final Report on PRAC, August 2013, p. 25; Annex II, Master Plan PRAC 2012, vol 2, p. 2, 3, 30, 32, 550/pdf.\n\nRelating to invoices 535, 537, 583, 603 602, 614; Cost Estimation for Hamaca, Annex I, p. 14/15.\n\nCf. Earnest, Consolidated Expert Report, 17 October 2016, paras. 43-53.\n\n661.\n\nThe Respondent adds an item for *PREM* under OPEX, covering the period from 2012 to 2016. The invoices in the record478 indicate that this activity covers a variety of items typical for upgrader maintenance. It has not been explained to the Tribunal why these costs could or should not appear under \"Upgrader\" OPEX - an item that represents by far higher costs to such an extent that an allegation that its budget could not be allocated to what is understood by the new label \"PREM\" would require serious explanation supported by consistent documentary evidence479. The Respondent has failed to act accordingly. The item \"PREM\" does not appear in the Financial Statements (CLEX-094). While it may be said that the Claimants are going too far in concluding that the PREMs had not affected the upgrader performance (p. 79), one would at least expect that the Respondent demonstrates that they had a positive effect, on the OSF or otherwise. The Respondent does not accept such an expectation, arguing that expenses may be justified even if they do not result in a measurable increase in the upgrader's OSF. Implicitly, the Respondent accepts that such an increase was not measured (p. 80). Nonetheless, the Respondent fails to demonstrate the specific purpose of these PREMs, other than to concentrate a certain number of maintenance interventions under a common label and operational structure.\n\nFiguera Appendixes 115-118; see also Respondent's Reply of 31 July 2017, Annex 6; Claimants' Answers, 10 July 2017, Annex A.\n\nSerious disparities appear when comparing the projected expenses for 2012-2014 (Figuera Appendices 45, 77 and 79) to the amounts claimed by the Respondent (Cost Estimation for Hamaca, Annexes III-VI).\n\n662.\n\nIn respect of a PREM for 2016, the costs are alleged through a simple inflation increase from the 2015 PREM. More should have been expected in June 2017, when the Estimation was filed with the Tribunal (like bids and contracts). Furthermore, there does not seem be a real need for a PREM in a year where a turnaround was scheduled. The Tribunal cannot accept on such a speculative cost allegation.\n\n663.\n\nThe Respondent attributes US$ 7 million to a *catalyst purchase* in February 2010. It is true that changes in the catalyst unit took place from time to time and in between turnarounds, requiring the shutdown of the upgrader. The 2009 turnaround also involved work on the catalyst480. The report on this turnaround identifies by their numbers all reactors that were concerned481. The Respondent did not identify the reactors affected by the change scheduled for 2010, but it stated that the change that took place was \"partial\"482, referring also to Witness Figuera who explains the cause of this additional cost item. Purchase orders were supplied483, but no invoices. A 2009 Catalyst Change Price Summary shows costs for US$ 11.8 million484. Witness Figuera explains that the change in 2010 was only a partial one, since a portion of the catalyst that had been installed in 2009 was able to be salvaged. He states: \"The catalyst that was installed in 2009 failed due to the fault of the contractor\".485 This fact might explain the omission of the filing of any invoices. The testimony of Mr. Figuera leads to the conclusion that the costs for such reparation in 2010 cannot be borne by the Claimants.\n\nFiguera Appendix 76, Final Report on PetroPiar's 2009 turnaround, 21 September 2010, p. 8/9, 17, 27, 46.\n\nFiguera Appendix 76, p. 46\n\nCost Estimation for Hamaca, p. 81.\n\nFiguera Appendix 129.\n\nFiguera Appendix 130.\n\nFiguera, Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, footnote 125.\n\n664.\n\nAnother item on the unsuccessful operation of equipment of the upgrader relates to the *Tank 12 Repairs*. The Respondent explains that the operating procedures for start-up of the upgrader allowed volatile hydrocarbons to be routed to tank 12. The tank venting system as designed was inadequate to accommodate an overpressure situation when light hydrocarbons were routed to the tank. Several deformations to the tank's roof and cracks in the walls did occur already before the nationalization and they were contributors to the serious 2011 overpressure event when the tank caught fire486.\n\nFiguera Appendix 46, PetroPiar 2012 Final Report on the PRAC, August 2013, p. 86. For Witness Figuera, tank 12 had a design flaw; however, he did not object considering operational errors occurring on multiple occasions; Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, para. 50.\n\n665.\n\nThe Tribunal wonders why the Project let the tank 12 in operation until the incident in 2011 when the critical condition of this item was known already before June 2007487. This leaves room for contributory negligence by the actual operators of the upgrader for more than four years. The incident appears less dramatic than it has been described. When the accident happened, the tank was taken out of service, but after two days, it started again with a limited load through a piping system that bypassed tank 61-TK-012 and permitted the direct flow of vacuum residue from the Crude Unit to the Coker Unit488. A decision had been made to undertake the construction of a new tank (61-TK-061), which was scheduled to commence by mid-2012489. Tank 12 came back on line in May 2013490.\n\nDifficulties with tanks also appeared at Petrozuata, where a tank roof repair project was ongoing in early 2007 already; cf. Petrozuata Preliminary Monthly Report of February 2007, p. 2 (LECG-156, p. 38/pdf).\n\nCf. Memorandum from Francisco Vel\u00e1squez, Manager of the Upgrader, to Ysaac Donis, President of PetroPiar, 19 June 2013, Figuera Appendix 132.\n\nCf. Figuera Appendix 131, PetroPiar, Motivated Administrative Act dated 10 February 2012 (p. 1), further noting that the reconstruction of tank 12 had to be accomplished on 30 June 2012 (p. 4). The construction of the new tank was not undertaken; Fourth Supplemental Testimony, 7 January 2015, footnote 134; TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4787:15-21, 4788:11-18 (Preziosi).\n\nFiguera, Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, footnote 109.\n\n666.\n\nNo explanation was provided by the Respondent about the availability of contributions from an insurer. The fact that documents provided to the Tribunal are all contracts including amendments, without any invoice, raises suspicion. The Respondent does not prove that the costs were actually incurred by the Project and not by a third party, like a contractor or an insurance company. Counsel for the Respondent told the Tribunal that no property damage or business interruption insurance was available491, but he ultimately admitted that the evidence was missing492. More than half of the amount of costs was contracted before the 2012 turnaround; this would mean that work on tank 12 was performed during this period and may be included in that budget493. Witness Figuera showed a presentation of costs for major repairs of the tank, which are substantially different from those in Annex VII of the Respondent's Cost Estimation for Hamaca494. The matter remained unclear. It would have been the Respondent's burden to demonstrate that the costs claimed have not been paid by any third party and that there is no overlap with the 2012 turnaround. The question also remains unanswered whether tank 12 did not serve the production of blended oil that contains a fraction of light hydrocarbon. For all these many reasons, the Tribunal cannot accept that these costs should be borne by the Claimants in a but-for scenario.\n\nTR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4806 :12-15 (Kahale).\n\nTR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 16, p. 4807 :18-22 (Kahale).\n\nAt the 2009 turnaround, tank 61-V-012 was an item of examination between 18 October and 25 November 2009; cf. Figuera Appendix 76, Final Report on PetroPiar's 2009 Turnaround, 21 September 2010, p. 15.\n\nFiguera Appendix 78.\n\n667.\n\nThe Respondent lists for Hamaca a separate item on *well repairs,* as it does for Petrozuata. The Tribunal's conclusion remains the same. The Respondent's figures are allegedly based on Mr. Pati\u00f1o's findings and on testimony submitted in the *Mobile* arbitration. As stated above, Mr. Pati\u00f1o provides no expert knowledge in this respect and the testimony delivered in another proceeding cannot be introduced into the record of this Tribunal. Well repairs' costs not supported by evidence, they remain included in the costs for upstream based on the CEM from where the Respondent suggested to have them removed.\n\n668.\n\nAs for Petrozuata, the Respondent's cost list for OPEX at Hamaca includes an item on *solid handling facilities trucking,* covering the period between 2009 and 2014 for a total amount of US$ 70,628,979495. The bulk of these costs relate to the years 2012 to 2014; no invoice refers to 2011, and for each year 2009 and 2010, the invoices are less than one million. These figures demonstrate, as this applies to Petrozuata, that the investment in trucking coke was not caused by the fire and the restoration of the solids handling facility. It had other logistical reasons that have nothing to do with the operational scheme based on the Association Agreements and the but-for scenario.\n\nAnnex VIII of the Cost Estimation for Hamaca.\n\n669.\n\nIn respect of Hamaca, as it had done for Petrozuata, the Respondent adds figures representing the compounded amounts for CAPEX and OPEX taken from those *financial statements* that were available (CLEX-094). It states that it did so in response to the Tribunal's request for further information on actual production. But the Respondent has not relied on these statements496. The Respondent wanted at least to show that taken from an overall perspective the actual costs reported in the financial statements are above those claimed in this proceeding.\n\nCost Estimation for Hamaca, cover page, last footnote, p. 95.\n\n670.\n\nA particular item relates to the amounts of costs to be considered at Petrozuata and Hamaca during the three years after the Projects suffer a serious decline since 2024 and 2034, respectively. The available documentation shows that as from these years, the projections for CAPEX go down to about 30%, while OPEX only slightly decreases for three more years at least (not taking account of drilling and turnarounds any longer)497. The Tribunal will use these estimates.\n\nCf. CEM, p. 41/pdf (LECG-085).\n\ng.

Corocoro\n-----------\n\n672.\n\nThe Claimants note that Mr. Figuera's documentary support for alleged costs for Corocoro is virtually non-existent. He relies on a number of slides and on a single contract relating to the Interim Processing Facility (IPF) lease. The Respondent's valuation experts assume an additional cost of over US$ 2 million each month until the Central Processing Facility (CPF) came online in February 2012. However, the IPF was no longer needed as from the time when the CPF came on track. The second difference in the Parties' positions relates to the exchange rate applicable to the Bolivar-denominated costs. The resulting cost inflation is unwarranted.\n\n673.\n\nIn sum, as for Petrozuata and Hamaca, the Claimants submit that the Projects' pre-expropriation business planning documents and Economic Models are the most reliable evidence of the production-related costs that the Corocoro Project would incur in the but-for world. With respect to the alternative valuation scenarios, the Parties' quantum experts apply essentially the same methodology on costs with respect to their 2007 valuations.\n\n674.\n\nThe Respondent states once more that in the post-nationalization period costs have been significantly higher, due not only to industry inflation and high inflation in Bolivar-based costs as a result of Venezuelan inflation that was not offset by timely devaluations, but also because of costs associated with maintenance activities that were grossly underestimated in the models in question. In an *ex post* analysis, the Claimants are not entitled to be compensated on the basis of picking and choosing the historical facts that are to their benefit, such as the increase in oil prices, while ignoring those to their detriment, such as the higher costs resulting from inflation and the higher than projected costs on maintenance.\n\n675.\n\nThe Respondent's experts have relied largely on the costs set forth in the ConocoPhillips Composite Economic Model, with two adjustments. First, because the production profile they have used has lower annual volumes than those set forth in the model, the annual operating costs are somewhat lower, reflecting the fact that a portion of the operating costs vary with production. Second, because the IPF would have been required for a longer period of time in light of the delays in the completion of the skids and the integration and commissioning of the CPF that would have been expected as of the date of nationalization, the Respondent's experts have included additional operating expenses based on the fee schedule established in the contract for the lease of the IPF.\n\n676.\n\nThe Respondent's experts have used actual operating and capital costs incurred through 2013. After that time, there were no additional capital costs. As to the post-2013 operating costs, the Respondent assumes that such costs are 70% fixed and 30% variable. It is also assumed that the IPF would have continued to be used until April 2012, when the CPF was commissioned.\n\n677.\n\nThe Tribunal notes again the poor documentary evidence for costs. As it has done for Pet-rozuata and Hamaca, the Tribunal takes as a basis for Corocoro the figures retained in the Composite Economic Model (CEM)498. It assumes that the input of inflation together with exchange rates on the Bolivar portion of the expenses is the same for this Project499. The Claimants do not offer calculations of their own that the Tribunal could use for its assessment. The Respondent refers to numerous PetroSucre Management reports that appear to have been prepared for internal use and contain no information which make it possible for the Tribunal to understand the components of broader cost items500.\n\nCf. p. 127/128/pdf.\n\nWitness Figuera confirmed that as for Petrozuata and Hamaca, the operating costs for Corocoro are approximately 70% in Bolivars and 30% in US dollars (Third Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 114).\n\nFor CAPEX and OPEX: Figuera Appendices 93-96. These documents are presented by the Respondent as \"Reports\" (Cost Estimation for Corocoro, p. 9, 11). They are not. They are slides used in a presentation without any explanation.\n\n678.\n\nOne other remaining critical item is the leasing cost for the IPF. While the Claimants accept IPF leasing costs through 2008, when their own involvement in the Project caused a delay of delivery for the CPF, they oppose the inclusion of leasing costs for a longer period, until April 2012. For the Claimants, this second part of delay is attributable to PDVSA that took over the Project in March 2007 when the CPF was on track to be completed by the end of 2008. Additionally, no invoices are shown that would cover the period between 2009 and April 2012. The Claimants also observe that the IPF was expropriated in 2009, with the effect that no leasing was required to be paid after that date.\n\n679.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that such leasing costs would have been charged to the Project in a but-for situation. No invoice has been submitted. The contract between Conoco and Hanover has been executed on 25 September 2006501. The Tribunal's copy does not contain the \"Service Schedule\" (Exhibit D). In another Annex it is noted that the service period shall be 24 months (Exhibit E). This would mean that the lease was not for a longer period than until end September 2008502. Beyond that date, it is not explained how any extension of such performance would be connected to a but-for situation. Additionally, when it is correct that, as stated by the Respondent503, compensation for the expropriation was paid in mid-2005, the expropriation effective on 26 June 2007 did not deprive the Project of an asset it was no longer holding as its property at that time. The legal holder of the IPF has not been clarified by the Respondent nor the legal relation between the (expropriating) State and the Project (user of the IPF). Witness Figuera stated that the nationalization occurred in May 2009 and it follows for him that if the Corocoro Project had continued as an Association, a rent would have to be paid until April 2012 when the CPF was commis-sioned504. However, as long as this nationalization is not explained, there is no evidence before this Tribunal that the IPF would not have been expropriated anyhow. In sum, the Tribunal does not include IPF leasing costs for 2007 when no oil was produced, but it adds to the amount of OPEX for year 2008 the sum of MUS$ 120,883 that is accepted by the Claimants.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Corocoro - Costs |\n|  | CAPEX US$ MM | CAPEX inflation index | CAPEX actual US$ MM | OPEX US$ MM | OPEX inflation index | OPEX Actual US$ MM |\n| 2007 \u00bd | 98,103 | 1.19 | 116,743 | 19,050 | 1.17 | 22,289 |\n| 2008 | 40,048 | 1.42 | 56,868 | 64,311 | 1.47 | 215,420505 |\n| 2009 | 3,668 | 1.49 | 5,465 | 113,700 | 1.76 | 200,112 |\n| 2010 | 128,732 | 1.28 | 164,777 | 114,000 | 1.27 | 144,780 |\n| 2011 | 10,000 | 1.45 | 14,500 | 109,100 | 1.53 | 166,923 |\n| 2012 |  |  |  | 107,800 | 1.79 | 192,962 |\n| 2013 |  |  |  | 98,600 | 1.73 | 170,578 |\n| 2014 |  |  |  | 94,100 | 2.49 | 234,309 |\n| 2015 |  |  |  | 74,000 | 4.78 | 353,720 |\n| 2016 |  |  |  | 72,700 | 1.04 | 75,608 |\n| 2017 |  |  |  | 72,300 | 2.12 | 153,276 |\n| 2018 |  |  |  | 71,300 | 1.61 | 114,793 |\n| 2019 |  |  |  | 70,900 | 1.56 | 110,604 |\n| 2020 |  |  |  | 70,600 | 1.53 | 108,018 |\n| 2021 |  |  |  | 69,900 | 1.53 | 106,947 |\n| 2022 |  |  |  | 69,900 | 1.56 | 109,044 |\n| 2023 |  |  |  | 69,500 | 1.58 | 109,810 |\n| 2024 |  |  |  | 69,200 | 1.61 | 111,412 |\n| 2025 |  |  |  | 69,200 | 1.64 | 113,488 |\n| 2026 |  |  |  | 69,200 | 1.67 | 115,564 |\n| 2027 |  |  |  | 0 |  | 0 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n\nFiguera Appendix 97.\n\nA project for an extension of the IPF to 45,000 BPD for 18 months has been submitted to the Tribunal (Figuera Appendix 98). The Respondent did not confirm that this project was executed but it claims the related costs.\n\nCost Estimation for Corocoro, p. 15.\n\nThird Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 113.\n\nThis amount includes MUS$ 120,883 for IPF leasing costs; CLEX-086, OPEX(CR).\n\n**VIII. Prices and Revenues**\n-----------------------------\n\n680.\n\nBased on the volumes of production determined above in Section VI, the monetary value of that production has to be determined. For the 2016 ex *post* valuation, actual market prices and the prices mentioned on the invoices for the historical period since the date of expropriation can be determined. The second part of the analysis on prices then relates to the oil price forecast from 2017 until the date of expiration of the production of each of the Projects. As the Tribunal has explained, it does not retain purely artificial prices projected in June 2007 and will retain prices that are known and therefore represent an indicator for the true loss suffered by the Claimants.\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n681.\n\nThe Claimants rely on their experts' valuation that is based on the relationship between the Projects' crudes and observed benchmark prices for the historical period. The experts then adopt an oil price forecast from 2017 until the expiration of the Agreements.\n\n682.\n\nThe Claimants submit that there are no major conceptual differences between the Parties' projections of syncrude prices. Both Parties: (a) take a primary benchmark, being either Brent crude or West Texas Intermediate crude. The Claimants' experts take the latter for the 2007 valuation and the former for the 2016 valuation; (b) determine the relationship between that primary benchmark and a regional marker for heavy crude (Maya crude), in order to generate a reliable price trajectory for this crude; and (c) they determine the relationship between the price of that regional, heavy crude (Maya) and the historic sales prices obtained for the products produced by the Projects.\n\n683.\n\nDespite the broad agreement between the Parties, the prices they use in their valuation models differ. When leaving aside a number of smaller issues, there appear to be two major areas of disagreement.\n\n684.\n\nThe first disagreement concerns the Claimants experts' approach to the analysis of all available oil price projections with the aim of arriving at a single forecast for future prices until 2037. The Respondent's experts, on the other hand, conduct their price forecast until 2020 only, and then assume that oil prices will remain flat, in nominal terms. They assume that Brent crude will reach a price of US$ 67.50/barrel by the end of 2020, and then remain at that same price until the end of 2037, without any adjustment, even for inflation. This is unrealistic, and not reconcilable with the use of an inflation factor of 2% for Project costs. Therefore, for Brailovsky and Flores, crude oil becomes less and less valuable over time in real terms, while extracting it becomes more costly. These experts submit that there are not enough market forecasts beyond 2020. But there are sufficient numbers of market forecasts extending beyond 2020 to construct a reliable sample. In prior stages of this arbitration, the same experts adopted a 30-year oil price forecast to 2037. But now, they want to drive down damages by any means possible.\n\n685.\n\nThe second error of the Respondent's valuation relates to the price at which Hamaca syncrude has been and will be sold. Historically, it was sold at a premium to Maya crude oil, but the Respondent's experts assume that it has been and will continue to be sold at a discount to Maya. This assumption relates to post-expropriation operational choices by PDVSA, which have allegedly resulted in the sale of lower quality syncrude. Such a choice should not be considered in a but-for analysis. Absent the expropriation, the Project would have sold the same grade of Hamaca syncrude as had been sold prior to the taking. The Tribunal should reject Venezuela's erroneous price forecasting methodology, which ignores reliable market data.\n\n686.\n\nEven if the Claimants' losses were to be valued as of the date of the taking in June 2007, the Tribunal would be entitled to take into account the post-expropriation increase in the market prices of crude oil, as was demonstrated in the Awards and Decisions *Rumeli Telekom A.S.*506, *Tidewater*507, and *Amco*508. Accounting for those actual price increases would more accurately reflect the pre-expropriation value of the Projects and avoid a situation in which Venezuela is unjustly enriched. Actual oil prices shed light on the actual value of the Projects. In practical terms, using post-expropriation crude oil prices would increase the valuation of the Projects, as of June 2007, by approximately 48%.\n\n*Republic of Kazakhstan v.

The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n687.\n\nThe Respondent also observes that with respect to prices in an *ex post* valuation the Parties' experts use similar methodologies. They both look at available oil price forecasts for Brent crude oil, a light crude oil produced in the North Sea, and Maya crude oil, a heavy oil produced in Mexico. From these figures, they derive a \"light-heavy\" differential, *i.e.* the difference between the higher quality Brent as compared to lower quality Maya. They then compare the prices at which CCO produced by the Projects has been sold historically to historical Maya crude oil prices as a basis for projecting the prices at which the CCO would sell in the future as compared with projected prices for Brent crude oil. The Respondent further explains that the Project crude oils are inferior in quality to WTI. WTI prices can therefore not be used alone. Light (high API), sweet (low sulfur) crude oils like WTI will have higher values than heavy (low API), sour (high sulfur) crude oils like those produced by the Projects.\n\n688.\n\nThe Respondent's experts compiled an updated sample of Brent price forecasts that were issued between 1 May and 30 September 2016 and calculated the median for these forecasts for the next five years, after which they have projected that the price of Brent would remain flat, on the assumption that no one can know whether such price will end up being above or below those forecasts as from 2020. The Claimants' experts, in contrast, assume that oil prices will continue to increase at the rate of expected US inflation. For the Respondent's experts, such simplistic perspective is not reliable. There is no justification for assuming ever increasing oil prices over the remaining 20-year terms of the Projects. In two forecasts made in June 2015 and May 2016, respectively, the Claimants' expert, Dr. Abdala, demonstrated the great difference in price scenarios and their high degree of uncertainty. On other occasions, ConocoPhillips has typically not forecast prices more than for a few years into the future. A May 2014 presentation for investors shows that even for a short period of time, ConocoPhillips' price projections did not contemplate the possibility of price dropping into the US$ 30-40 dollar range, as occurred in 2015 and 2016. In an update to investors in 2016, ConocoPhillips stated simply that price recovery remains unclear. In light of these uncertainties, the decision of the Respondent's experts to maintain nominal Brent price projections flat in the long term is reasonable.\n\n689.\n\nThe Respondent's experts calculated a Maya-Brent differential of 14.11%, while the Claimants' experts reached a slightly lower differential of 13.65% for the historical period. (a) In respect of Petrozuata, the Respondent's experts relied on actual Petrozuata CCO prices through July 2016, and applied the historical Maya-Petrozuata CCO differential to their Maya price forecast, resulting in an average differential of 0.08%, Maya thus being traded slightly below Petrozuata CCO. On the other hand, the Claimants' experts set Maya and Petrozuata CCO at par. Both Parties are thus in virtual agreement on this point. (b) For Hamaca, the Respondent's experts, aside from taking into account all historic sales data through July 2016, include the fact that starting in October 2008, the Hamaca Project sold a lower-quality crude called Special Hamaca Blend, based on the lower performance of the upgrader and the quality of the EHCO. On average, Hamaca CCO has sold at 98.36% of Maya. The Claimants' experts do not take this into account and set the Hamaca CCO price at a premium of 5.56% over Maya, thereby artificially inflating compensation. The compensation provisions of the Hamaca Association Agreement stipulate that compensation shall be calculated assuming Brent prices of US$ 27 per barrel (in 1996 dollars). The Respondent's experts made the required adjustments. (c) In respect of Corocoro, the Respondent's experts relied on data from June 2007 through December 2015 to calculate the average differential between Maya and Corocoro crude oil prices. This resulted in an average differential of 0.4%, which was applied to their price forecast through 2037. The Claimants' experts have applied the same prices in their *ex post* valuation of Corocoro.\n\n690.\n\nThe result of the differences in the Parties' respective price assumptions on the Claimants' *ex post* calculations with the compensation provisions is that the Claimants' valuation moves downwards from 8,518 to 7,625 billion. If, on the other hand, compensation for measures the Claimants accept as not being discriminatory is excluded, and when further proper production and cost data are used, as well as proper price assumptions, the relevant figure that has to be compared to the initial amount of 8,518 billion becomes 1,484 billion.\n\n691.\n\nIn their *ex ante* valuation, the Respondent's experts projected the quality differentials between WTI and the crudes from the Projects by using the price ratio included in the Composite Economic Model (CEM). The experts relied on a survey of 11 forecasts from reputable sources and they calculated the median of the WTI forecasts in order to arrive at their WTI benchmark forecast. Further, the Respondent's experts generated a price forecast for Maya, to which a price ratio of 77.8% used in the ConocoPhillips CEM is then applied in order to obtain the Project valuations. The Claimants' experts introduced in their *ex ante* valuation a 20% Maya-to-WTI discount. In so doing, they artificially inflated the Maya price forecasts and reduced the Maya-WTI differential. The Respondent's experts equally relied on the CEM to obtain the price ratio applicable to the Corocoro crude oil. This projection reports that the price of Corocoro crude will be traded at 106.7% to Maya. The Claimants' experts base their price ratio on ConocoPhillips unsuccessful bid for Corocoro crude oil in June 2008, retaining a trade at 102.7% to Maya.\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\na. Petrozuata and Hamaca\n------------------------\n\n692.\n\nThe Tribunal has explained that it will determine the Claimants' loss during the historical period by reference to the actual oil prices that have been submitted through Witness Figuera's statement and the invoices filed by the Respondent and supported by documents piled up in various Appendices of Mr. Figuera's statements. It does not follow the Respondent's experts' view that the pertinent calculations may be impacted, in the case of Hamaca, by the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements, which do refer, indeed, to oil prices but do not determine their amount as it is derived from the oil market.\n\n693.\n\nIn order to assist the Tribunal's understanding of the documentary evidence, the Parties submitted jointly at the 2017 September hearing a table reproducing the prices each side retains on a year-by-year basis for the purpose of calculating revenue from the sales of oil at Petrozuata and Hamaca. This table reads as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Petrozuata CCO Prices (US$/Bbl) | Hamaca CCO Prices (US$/Bbl) |\n|  | Claimants\u2019 Prices | Respondent\u2019s Prices | Claimants\u2019 Prices | Respondent\u2019s Prices |\n| July-Dec. 2007 | 70.14 | 70.14 | 72.95 | 76.31 |\n| 2008 | 87.38 | 87.38 | 89.37 | 91.40 |\n| 2009 | 55.49 | 55.49 | 59.31 | 50.19 |\n| 2010 | 70.38 | 70.38 | 74.08 | 70.32 |\n| 2011 | 100.42 | 100.42 | 104.12 | 93.57 |\n| 2012 | 101.39 | 101.39 | 105.18 | 99.40 |\n| 2013 | 100.49 | 100.49 | 102.64 | 100.58 |\n| 2014 | 88.44 | 88.44 | 90.92 | 86.49 |\n| 2015 | 43.24 | 43.24 | 46.70 | 43.35 |\n| 2016 | 38.55 | 32.01 | 40.70 | 29.46 |\n| 2017 | 47.36 | 47.14 | 50.00 | 46.33 |\n| 2018 | 53.43 | 53.08 | 56.40 | 52.16 |\n| 2019 | 56.99 | 54.15 | 60.16 | 53.22 |\n| 2020 | 59.14 | 58.02 | 62.43 | 57.02 |\n| 2021 | 68.89 | 58.02 | 72.72 | 57.02 |\n| 2022 | 70.15 | 58.02 | 74.06 | 57.02 |\n| 2023 | 72.37 | 58.02 | 76.39 | 57.02 |\n| 2024 | 74.34 | 58.02 | 78.48 | 57.02 |\n| 2025 | 76.47 | 58.02 | 80.73 | 57.02 |\n| 2026 | 77.81 | 58.02 | 82.14 | 57.02 |\n| 2027 | 79.18 | 58.02 | 83.58 | 57.02 |\n| 2028 | 80.57 | 58.02 | 85.05 | 57.02 |\n| 2029 | 82.13 | 58.02 | 86.70 | 57.02 |\n| 2030 | 83.79 | 58.02 | 88.45 | 57.02 |\n| 2031 | 85.47 | 58.02 | 90.22 | 57.02 |\n| 2032 | 87.18 | 58.02 | 92.03 | 57.02 |\n| 2033 | 88.92 | 58.02 | 93.87 | 57.02 |\n| 2034 | 90.70 | 58.02 | 95.74 | 57.02 |\n| 2035 | 92.51 | 58.02 | 97.66 | 57.02 |\n| 2036 | 94.36 | 58.02 | 99.61 | 57.02 |\n| 2037 | -- | -- | 101.60 | 57.02 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n\n694.\n\nThe Tribunal retains the numbers provided for Petrozuata for the years 2007 and 2008 as presented by the Parties on the basis of Mr. Figuera's first statement509. For the period 2009 to 2015 the prices have also been presented on agreed terms and will be applied by the Tribunal. As will be shown below, these prices are identical or very close to those calculated on the basis of the invoices submitted by Witness Figuera510. The Tribunal notes that the Claimants explain that their experts \"determine the correct relationship between the Project crudes and observed benchmark prices for that historical period\"511. The correct understanding is that these experts used the sales prices reported by Mr. Figuera for 2007/2008 and through the sample of invoices for the years 2009 to 2015, and that they use this pricing for Petrozuata until July 2016512.\n\nTable submitted at the 2017 September Hearing; Figuera Testimony, 20 July 2009, paras. 11/12.\n\nTable submitted at the 2017 September Hearing; Figuera Appendix 81 (for 2009-2013). Appendix 105 covers part of 2014, which is completed by Appendix 154 for this year and by Appendix 158 for 2015, both of which have not been introduced as evidence but for the purpose of information only.\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 306.\n\nCLEX-086, Revenues (PZ). The experts explain in their Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, paras. 66-72, that they used benchmark forecast of world crude oil prices and Maya prices exhibited under CLEX-087. However, the figures provided in this exhibit are inconsistent with the actual prices that have been invoiced by the Projects and used by the same experts in their valuation. They added ultimately that they determined the relevant prices by using the historical market prices (para. 73), at least for Petrozuata.\n\n695.\n\nThe figures reported by the Parties for Hamaca do not coincide. For the years 2007 and 2008, the Respondent relies again on Mr. Figuera's first statement513. The Claimants' prices are lower. While no explanation for this difference can be found for the year 2007, the Claimants' experts contend that actual sales prices could not be used \"because the Project has been selling lower quality crude at a small discount to Maya since 2008, reflecting PetroPiar's managerial decisions since the expropriation\". They conclude that this had the effect of lowering Hamaca syncrude prices, which - so they say - \"in our understanding\" would not have happened in a but-for scenario514. Therefore, the Claimants support prices higher than those actually invoiced between 2009 and 2015. The Claimants' experts have not relied on any evidence for their allegation. If the assumption had been that the Hamaca CCO suffered from a lowering of its API gravity, the information provided through the invoices (mentioned in the table on Hamaca below) demonstrates that this would be wrong. Between the major part of years of observation (2009-2013), the API gravity varied in irregular sequences between 20.62\u00b0 and 22.64\u00b0, whereas actual sale prices moved from US$ 55.50 (2009) to 100.58 (2011) and ultimately 100.50 (2013); there appears to be no relation of causality between the two groups of figures.\n\nTable submitted at the 2017 September Hearing; Figuera Testimony, 20 July 2009, paras. 37/38.\n\nAbdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 73(c), adding in para. 165 that this was so \"apparently\". The experts' explanation is inconsistent for the year 2008, where they are recording prices lower than the actual sales prices on which the Respondent relies.\n\n696.\n\nThe allegation of Respondent, based on its own experts' assertion that since October 2008, the Hamaca Project sold a lower-quality crude called Special Hamaca Blend is unsupported on the basis of the invoices to which the experts refer, where no such quality information is provided, nor its potential effect on price515. Moreover, the argument has no support in Mr. Figuera's allegations in respect of the quality of EHCO supplied and of the upgrader516, all the more so as Mr. Figuera does not draw consequences in respect of oil prices from his unsubstantiated assertions517.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 288.\n\nCf. Supplemental Testimony, paras. 64-79.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 18, p. 5164:21-5166:6 (Friedman).\n\n697.\n\nThe Respondent's explanations are less convincing than the numbers they are intended to confirm. In fact, the prices it presents for the years 2009 to 2015 are the same (subject to very minor differences caused by rounding and counting) as the average prices that can be derived from the invoices and the summary tables submitted at the end of the 2017 March hearing.\n\n698.\n\nIn respect of Hamaca, these invoices were originally compiled by the employees on the site at Mr. Figuera's request518. They provide the pertinent figures for each loading and the relevant totals per year, *i.e.* the volume of barrels sold and the price in US$ per year, together with the API gravity of each loading. From the total amount priced per year and the corresponding quantity of barrels the average price per barrel and per year can be calculated, as well as the yearly API gravity.\n\nFiguera Appendix 42.\n\n699.\n\nThe Claimants' experts use a significant 20% Maya-to-WTI discount519 for the purpose of reflecting \"the market consensus about the heavy-light price differential in the crude oil market\"520. They do not explain why this discount based on a lower oil price should be so high. There is a further element of speculation in the choice of forecast differentials between Brent and Maya between July 2016 and October 2016 only (generating a price forecast that is 13.65% lower than the Brent price)521.\n\nAbdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 72.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 65.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 71. The experts explain confusingly that they used actual Maya prices observed on the market between June 2007 and December 2016, but that they had been unable to find a significant sample of long-term Maya to WTI differential forecasts as of June 2007.\n\n700.\n\nThe Respondent's experts rely on the WTI and Maya differential they draw from the invoices for the period 2009 to 2015. Such differential, as it had been actually practiced during that period, was still a reliable marker for the pricing of oil from 2016 forward, as the Respondent's experts correctly submit522.\n\nCf. Brailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 286/289, further referring to their *Ex Post* Analyses and Projections Calculations as of 31 December 2016, Appendix 408.\n\n701.\n\nThe Claimants' experts' price forecast from 2016 is based on a sample of about 16 forecasts, from which a median is identified. The method as it has been applied raises a number of doubts, some of which have also been expressed by the Respondent. (1) Forecasts that are deviating in extreme proportions (\"outliers\") from the clear majority of forecasts should be eliminated, as they are manifestly not representative of the trend that needs to be identified. (2) Forecasts based on oil production in the region of the Projects should be included at a significant position; it is also not appropriate to disregard West Texas Intermediate (WTI) as the benchmark for an *ex post* valuation (and to replace it by an European index), but to adopt this benchmark for the *ex ante* valuation.\n\n702.\n\nFrom another perspective, the Claimants' experts' position is placed in contrast to the real world of oil prices over 20 years. Indeed, the prices determined by the experts year by year lead to a double increase that seems unrealistic. When 2020 is taken as a critical year (where the Respondent abstains from any further forecast), the Claimants' Brent prices increase year by year, at a pace that is not defined or explained. The natural course of price evolution is different: there are ups and downs that are then consolidated in an average that may show a line going up. Additionally, from year 2026, the Claimants' price coefficient also climbs up without interruption (for both Petrozuata and Hamaca): each and every increase from one year to the next is higher than the previous increase, thus rendering the increase exponential. The Claimants' submission that oil prices must be connected to inflation (US-origin for the experts) is overly simplistic. It suffices to observe a number of recent years when oil prices were moving whereas inflation remained stable in many countries.\n\n703.\n\nIn some respect, the Respondent's experts' position that no certainty is available as from year 2020 and that therefore a flat rate should be used until the end of each Projects' lifetime is interesting, or, as the Respondent puts it, \"reasonable\". All depends, however, what a \"flat rate\" means and how it is implemented. The Respondent's flat rate over 15 years is the rate identified for year 2020, *i.e.* US$ 58.02 for Petrozuata and US$ 57.02 for Hamaca. However, this is not the only method to determine a flat rate. In light of the need to fix a rate as closely as possible to the estimated future, a flat rate determined on the basis of an average over several years would certainly come closer to such goal. It may be difficult, as the Respondent's experts say, to identify such future rates year-by-year, but it appears highly artificial to suddenly stop the counting in 2020 and to take that year's figure as applicable for the coming 15 years523. It has also been said that keeping prices flat when costs are increasing is disturbing524.\n\nThis can further be demonstrated in comparison to the analyses the experts performed in 2013 (Appendix BF-010), where the flat rate started in 2018 at US$ 82.42 for Hamaca and at US$ 83.24 for Petrozuata. A year later, the flat rate was set to begin also in 2018, but at a price of US$ 72.75 for Hamaca and US$ 73.54 for Petrozuata (Appendix BF-215).\n\nTR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 18, p. 5161:6-13 (Friedman).\n\n704.\n\nThe Respondent's experts demonstrate that another approach is perfectly possible when they proceed with their *ex ante* valuation, where they identify prices increasing year by year until the end of each of the Projects, going up to US$ 71.48 for Petrozuata in 2036 and US$ 76.80 for Hamaca in 2037525. While it may be argued that these numbers are derived from the CEM and strictly related to an *ex ante* valuation, they nonetheless demonstrate that a valuation containing an increase in oil prices is possible, even if the underlying assumptions may be a matter for debate.\n\nCLEX-085, Revenues (PZ) and (HC).\n\n705.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusions develop as follows: (1) For the years 2007 to 2015, the prices experienced by the Projects' sales are the most reliable information about the revenues obtained under a but-for scenario. The Parties agree on the applicable figures for Petrozuata. The Tribunal retains the corresponding prices from the Hamaca sales, thus disregarding the Claimants' experts' allegation on lower quality of Hamaca oil that is not evidenced by the prices actually obtained by the Project. The experts also fail in their allegation that a but-for situation would have produced oil of higher quality, paid at higher prices. In this respect, the Tribunal also recalls that the prices to be retained determine the loss suffered by the Claimants and their right for compensation. Therefore, the burden of proof of the applicable and most reliable estimations rest with the Claimants.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Petrozuata CCO Prices and Sales 2007 - 2015 (US$/Bbl) |\n|  | Claimants' Prices US$ | Respondent's Prices US$ | Barrels sold | Invoices US$ | Price per Barrel Sold US$ |\n| July-Dec. 2007 | 70.14 | 70.14 | 15,568,593 | 1,091,900,000 | 70.13 |\n| 2008 | 87.38 | 87.38 | 35,700,904 | 3,119,400,000 | 87.38 |\n| 2009 | 55.49 | 55.49 | 33,197,701 | 1,842,584,901.38 | 55,50 |\n| 2010 | 70.38 | 70.38 | 21,718,453 | 1,525,217,426.98 | 70.23 |\n| 2011 | 100.42 | 100.42 | 24,114,978 | 2,425,577,496.25 | 100.58 |\n| 2012 | 101.39 | 101.39 | 33,974,140 | 3,496,629,804.93 | 102.92 |\n| 2013 | 100.49 | 100.49 | 29,660,975 | 2,980,831,978.58 | 100.50 |\n| 2014 | 88.44 | 88.44 | 25,913,252 | 2,291,651,539.98 | 88.44 |\n| 2015 | 43.24 | 43.24 | 22,213,048 | 960,435,949.07 | 43.24 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Hamaca CCO Prices and Sales 2007-2015 (US$/Bbl) |\n|  | Claimants' Prices US$ | Respondent's Prices US$ | Barrels sold | API Gravity | Invoices US$ | Price per Barrel sold US$ |\n| 2007 \u00bd | 72.95 | 76.31 | 28,939,154 |  | 2,208,400,000 | 76.31 |\n| 2008 | 89.37 | 91.40 | 52,430,724 |  | 4,792,200,000 | 91.40 |\n| 2009 | 59.31 | 50.19 | 39,845,387 | 22.64 | 1,999,276,756.27 | 50.18 |\n| 2010 | 74.08 | 70.32 | 49,468,161 | 20.86 | 3,475,144,882.06 | 70.25 |\n| 2011 | 104.12 | 93.57 | 47,449,859 | 21.26 | 4,439,787,139.08 | 93,57 |\n| 2012 | 105.18 | 99.40 | 25,214,117 | 20.62 | 2,506,219,558.63 | 90.40 |\n| 2013 | 102.64 | 100.58 | 47,131,231 | 21.69 | 4,740,565,039.75 | 100.58 |\n| 2014 | 90.92 | 86.49 | 52,955,490 | 19.93 | 4,580,123,865.36 | 86.49 |\n| 2015 | 46.70 | 43.35 | 51,287,407 | 19.68 | 2,223,505,411.11 | 43.35 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n\n706.\n\n(2) The Tribunal cannot agree with the adjustments or the price differentials proposed by the Claimants' experts for the years starting in 2016, which are again simply stated but not explained or supported by evidence. The prices provided by the Respondent must therefore prevail for the years 2016 to 2020.\n\n707.\n\n(3) The Tribunal does not share the Respondent's position which relies on a flat rate based on the prices retained for year 2020 until the end of each Project's lifetime. In its own *ex ante* valuation, the Respondent accepts that oil prices do not remain fixed at an identical level over many years, a view that would be totally incompatible with basic notions of market and economics. In this valuation, the Respondent submits that between 2020 and 2036 or 2037, prices move from US$ 52.07 to US$ 71.48 for Petrozuata and from US$ 54.85 to US$ 76.80 for Hamaca, which means an approximate year-by-year increase of US$ 1.17 for Petrozuata and US$ 1.22 for Hamaca. The Tribunal takes this as a valid assumption.\n\n708.\n\n(4) For the years 2021 onwards, the Tribunal has as its only reliable evidence the numbers retained by the Respondent's experts up to the year 2020. It takes the figures for that year (US$ 58.02 for Petrozuata and US$ 57.02 for Hamaca) as the basis to be completed by an average increase per year of 1.20% for each Project. By reference to the tables used above, the end price would become US$ 77.22 for Petrozuata (2036) and US$ 77.42 (2037) for Hamaca.\n\n709.\n\n(5) The Tribunal finds further support for its approach in the comparison between the average prices for the period 2007 to 2020 and from 2021 until the end of each Project on the basis of the Association Agreements. For Petrozuata, the average price for the first period is US$ 68.70 and for the second term US$ 68.22, whereas for Hamaca, the average for the first period is US$ 67.84 and for the second term US$ 67.82. This means that except for a very small difference, the overall average price per year for each Project, counted between 2007 and 2036/2037, is the same.\n\n710.\n\nAt this juncture, the Tribunal takes account in the presentation of the pertinent figures for prices and sales of the dates it determined for the end of production for each Project, *i.e.* 2026 for Petrozuata and 2036 for Hamaca.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Tribunal's Assessment of Oil Production for Sale and Prices |\n|  | Petrozuata | Hamaca |\n|  | MMB | Price per Barrel sold US$ | Total Income US$ | MMB | Price per Barrel sold US$ | Total Income US$ |\n| 2007 \u00bd | 15,568,593 | 70.14 | 1,091,981,113 | 28,939,154 | 76.31 | 2,208,346,842 |\n| 2008 | 35,700,904 | 87.38 | 3,119,544,992 | 52,430,724 | 91.40 | 4,792,168,174 |\n| 2009 | 36,200,000 | 55.49 | 2,008,738,000 | 58,400,000 | 50.18 | 2,930,512,000 |\n| 2010 | 36,200,000 | 70.38 | 2,547,756,000 | 58,400,000 | 70.32 | 4,106,688,000 |\n| 2011 | 36,200,000 | 100.42 | 3,635,204,000 | 58,400,000 | 93.57 | 5,464,488,000 |\n| 2012 | 36,200,000 | 101.39 | 3,670,318,000 | 58,400,000 | 99.40 | 5,804,960,000 |\n| 2013 | 36,200,000 | 100.49 | 3,637,738,000 | 58,400,000 | 100.58 | 5,873,872,000 |\n| 2014 | 36,200,000 | 88.44 | 3,201,528,000 | 58,400,000 | 86.49 | 5,051,016,000 |\n| 2015 | 36,200,000 | 43.24 | 1,565,288,000 | 58,400,000 | 43.35 | 2,531,640,000 |\n| 2016 | 36,200,000 | 32.01 | 1,158,762,000 | 58,400,000 | 29.46 | 1,720,464,000 |\n| 2017 | 36,200,000 | 47.14 | 1,706,468,000 | 58,400,000 | 46.33 | 2,705,672,000 |\n| 2018 | 36,200,000 | 53.08 | 1,921,496,000 | 58,400,000 | 52.16 | 3,046,144,000 |\n| 2019 | 36,200,000 | 54.15 | 1,960,230,000 | 58,400,000 | 53.22 | 3,108,048,000 |\n| 2020 | 36,200,000 | 58.02 | 2,100,324,000 | 58,400,000 | 57.02 | 3,329,968,000 |\n| 2021 | 36,200,000 | 59.22 | 2,143,764,000 | 58,400,000 | 58.22 | 3,400,048,000 |\n| 2022 | 36,200,000 | 60.42 | 2,187,204,000 | 58,400,000 | 59.42 | 3,470,128,000 |\n| 2023 | 36,200,000 | 61.62 | 2,230,644,000 | 58,400,000 | 60.62 | 3,540,208,000 |\n| 2024 | 26,600,000 | 62.82 | 1,671,012,000 | 58,400,000 | 61.82 | 3,610,288,000 |\n| 2025 | 22,100,000 | 64.02 | 1,414,842,000 | 58,400,000 | 63.02 | 3,680,368,000 |\n| 2026 | 19,000,000 | 65.22 | 1,239,180,000 | 58,400,000 | 64.22 | 3,750,448,000 |\n| 2027 |  |  |  | 58,400,000 | 65.42 | 3,820,528,000 |\n| 2028 |  |  |  | 58,400,000 | 66.62 | 3,890,608,000 |\n| 2029 |  |  |  | 58,400,000 | 67.82 | 3,960,688,000 |\n| 2030 |  |  |  | 58,400,000 | 69.02 | 4,030,768,000 |\n| 2031 |  |  |  | 58,400,000 | 70.22 | 4,100,848,000 |\n| 2032 |  |  |  | 58,400,000 | 71.42 | 4,170,928,000 |\n| 2033 |  |  |  | 58,400,000 | 72.62 | 4,241,008,000 |\n| 2034 |  |  |  | 51,000,000 | 73.82 | 3,764,820,000 |\n| 2035 |  |  |  | 47,000,000 | 75.02 | 3,525,940,000 |\n| 2036 |  |  |  | 43,000,000 | 76.22 | 3,277,460,000 |\n| Total | 661,969,497 |  | 44,212,022,105 | 1,682,369,878 |  | 112,909,071,016 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n\n711.\n\nThe next and last step in this Section will consist of matching the sales figures for each Project with the costs as they have been assessed in the preceding Section, and to determine the Gross Revenue for each Project (before Royalties and Taxes).

They accept that for the period between 2008 and 2015 the actual oil prices as experienced with the sales that have been reported by Witness Figuera are to be used. The Tribunal retains the numbers jointly presented by the Parties, while noting that they are slightly different than the prices mentioned on the yearly summaries of the sales reported by Witness Figuera. The positions also became identical between the experts on both sides for the years from 2016. The Respondent's experts had derived from the data between July 2007 and 2015 an average differential of 0.4% between Maya and Corocoro crude oil prices that they applied to their price forecast529. For their 2016 valuation, the Claimants' experts understand that this figure reflects the \"average historical differential\" that they accept to apply as 0.4% premium over Maya530. The Respondent therefore noted correctly that the Claimants' experts apply the same method for pricing531. However, when looking at the figures reproduced in the summary tables of each experts' team, on which the further calculations in view of the assessment of damages are based, it appears that the numbers do not match. Taking first the numbers for the years 2016 to 2020, the Claimants' experts' figures532 are always higher than those of the Respondent's experts533, although both sides have declared that they used the same method, including the same Maya differential. The explanation detected by the Tribunal is the following: The Maya prices for each Party are different534, and this results in different oil prices for the years 2016 to 2020.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 295; *Ex Post* Analyses and Projections Calculations as of December 31, 2016, Appendix 408.\n\nAbdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 73(c). However, the experts also explained that beginning 2010 or so, they took the differential between the Brent and the Maya; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 13, p. 3769:10-3770:17 (Abdala).\n\nRespondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 393.\n\nCLEX-086, Price.\n\nBF-406, Revenues (CR).\n\nFor the Claimants' experts, the price for Maya is for each year from 2016 on: US$ 38.55, 47.36, 53.43, 56.99, 59.14 (CLEX-086, Price). For the Respondent's experts, the corresponding figures are: 33,02, 47.11, 53.04, 54.11, 57.97 (BF-406, Price Inputs). Based on each group of numbers, the prices as listed above result from the multiplication by the differential of 1,004.\n\n714.\n\nThe Parties' experts have admitted that the pricing for Corocoro oil follows very closely, if not identically, the prices applied to Petrozuata CCO. Therefore, the Respondent's experts' assessment that for the years 2016 to 2020 prices for Corocoro are in line with those for Petrozuata must prevail. This also means that the Maya differential used during the years 2008 to 2015 remains the same for the following years. Although the Claimants' experts affirm that they follow the same method, based on a 0.4% Maya differential, this is not correct as they take into account a different evolution of Maya prices.\n\n715.\n\nAs the Tribunal has found above in respect of the pricing for Petrozuata and Hamaca from 2020, it cannot follow the Respondent's choice of a flat rate staying constant until the end of the Projects. Such excessively artificial approach cannot determine the Claimants' losses. The most reasonable assessment of the price forecast is the model retained by the Tribunal for these two other Projects, consisting of a 1.2% price increase per year until the end of the Project.\n\n716.\n\nThe next step is then to apply the correct figures for prices to the volumes of production determined above until the end of production of the Project Corocoro, which is in 2026.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Tribunal's Assessment of Oil Production for Sale, Prices and Costs at Corocoro |\n|  | MMB | Price per Barrel sold US$ | Total Income US$ | CAPEX US$ MM | OPEX US$ MM | Gross Revenue Total US$ |\n| 2007 \u00bd | 0 | 0 | 0 | 116,743 | 22,289 | **-** 139,032,000 |\n| 2008 | 7,182,000 | 86.16 | 618,801,120 | 56,868 | 215,420 | 346,513,120 |\n| 2009 | 11,483,000 | 56.40 | 647,641,200 | 5,465 | 200,112 | 442,064,200 |\n| 2010 | 13,152,000 | 71.64 | 942,209,280 | 164,777 | 144,780 | 632,652,280 |\n| 2011 | 13,214,000 | 98.60 | 1,302,900,400 | 14,500 | 166,923 | 1,121,477,400 |\n| 2012 | 13,479,000 | 99.43 | 1,340,216,970 |  | 192,962 | 1,147,254,970 |\n| 2013 | 13,336,000 | 98.68 | 1,315,996,480 |  | 170,578 | 1,145,418,480 |\n| 2014 | 12,839,000 | 88.83 | 1,140,488,370 |  | 234,309 | 906,179,370 |\n| 2015 | 12,069,000 | 41.83 | 504,846,270 |  | 353,720 | 151,126,270 |\n| 2016 | 11,027,000 | 33.15 | 365,545,050 |  | 75,608 | 289,937,050 |\n| 2017 | 11,204,000 | 47.29 | 529,837,160 |  | 153,276 | 376,561,160 |\n| 2018 | 9,411,000 | 53.25 | 501,135,750 |  | 114,793 | 386,342,750 |\n| 2019 | 8,444,000 | 54.33 | 458,762,520 |  | 110,604 | 348,158,520 |\n| 2020 | 7,747,000 | 58.21 | 450,952,870 |  | 108,018 | 342,934,870 |\n| 2021 | 7,205,000 | 59.41 | 428,049,050 |  | 106,947 | 321,102,050 |\n| 2022 | 6,765,000 | 60.61 | 410,026,650 |  | 109,044 | 300,982,650 |\n| 2023 | 6,268,000 | 61.81 | 387,425,080 |  | 109,810 | 277,615,080 |\n| 2024 | 5,741,000 | 63.01 | 361,740,410 |  | 111,412 | 250,328,410 |\n| 2025 | 5,508,000 | 64.21 | 353,668,680 |  | 113,488 | 240,180,680 |\n| 2026 | 5,297,000 | 65.41 | 346,476,770 |  | 115,564 | 230,912,770 |\n| Total | 181,371,000 |  | 12,406,720,080 |  |  | 9,118,710,080 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n\n**IX. Royalties and Taxes**\n---------------------------\n\nA. General Observations and Findings\n------------------------------------\n\n717.\n\nThe taxation regime in Venezuela raises one of the key issues during the negotiation and the economic life of the Projects. Many different taxes have been introduced or raised prior to the expropriation. They constitute for the Claimants a series of coercive measures which, they submit, together with the forced migration, represent a bundle of discriminatory actions triggering their right for the compensation they claimed in the ICC Arbitration from PDVSA.\n\n718.\n\nBefore this Tribunal, the Claimants' claim is based on the violation of Article 6 of the BIT by the Venezuelan Republic. The taxation regime constitutes in this context a part of the economic life and value of the three Projects. Its impact on the valuation of the Claimants' loss and their claim for damages is important and now has to be addressed. The compensation provisions of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements do not govern the Claimants' right for compensation that they claim is based on the Treaty. However, these provisions may have a role to play in case certain taxes constitute discriminatory actions triggering a right for compensation that might counterbalance the impact of such taxes.\n\n719.\n\nThe valuation experts on both sides have each established a list of all royalties and taxes they consider applicable since 26 June 2007 or at a later date; they also rely on their respective Party's position535. The Tribunal will therefore account for the following taxes and contributions:\n\n(1) Royalties and Extraction Tax, both together operating as a royalty at a rate of 33.33%536.\n\n(2) Export Tax of 0.1% taken from the revenues of oil sold for export.\n\n(3) Science and Technology Contribution of 2% taken from the prior year's revenue from the sale of crude oil, reduced to 1% with effect as from 2012.\n\n(4) Anti-drug contribution of 1%537.\n\n(5) Social Contribution of 1% of the previous year's net income before taxes538.\n\n(6) Income Tax of 50% applicable to each Project's revenue (less royalties and other applicable taxes and contributions).\n\n(7) Sports tax of 1% accounted as from 2012.\n\nIn sum, the royalties and contributions (1) to (5) operate before the Income Tax (6) which applies when these prior contributions have already been deducted.\n\nCf. Abdala/Spiller, March 2016 Update, 18 March 2016, para. 28; Brailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 140, 341. Cf. also the Tables submitted by the Claimants on 20 March 2017.\n\nThe Respondent's experts state that the Projects \"would have been\" subject to a \"Special Advantage\" tax to be calculated in relation to the amount of royalties, taxes and contributions paid, but their explanation lacks precision and has no documentary support (cf. Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 140/g, further noting that this tax would not apply to Hamaca, cf. footnote 322). This tax seems to be comparable to the \"Shadow Tax\" noted by the Claimants' experts, but not explained either, nor supplied by any reference to legal or other sources (Abdala/Spiller, Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, Supplemental Report, 13 October 2014, para. 251/d).\n\nThe Claimants' experts do not account for the 1% anti-drug tax to the Hamaca Project, providing no reason (Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, Supplemental Report, 13 October 2014, footnote 290). The Respondent's experts refer to the Organic Law Against the Illicit Trafficking (BF-55), Article 96, that does not provide for such an exception (Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, footnote 300). The difference in treatment appears in the CEM (LECG-085, p. 14/15/pdf).\n\nThe Tribunal will take it a little bit simpler and count for this tax by reference to the income of the same year.\n\n720.\n\nA further precision relates to the determination of the base price to which the royalties and the extraction tax apply. These disbursements are not computed like all other contributions (2 to 5), including the sports tax (7), and income taxes (6). They are fixed by reference to the quantity of barrels extracted, identified as EHCO in the case of Petrozuata and Hamaca539. The rate of 33.33% applies to the volume and value of EHCO used for upgrading to heavy syncrude (CCO). For the purpose of determining such value, a EHCO reference price (also called \"royalty price\") was fixed and published by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum (\"MENPET\") on a monthly basis, in accordance with a complex formula contained in a governmental resolution. The experts on each side have noted this method used for collecting the royalty and extraction tax of 33.33%540. However, for the purpose of determining the applicable production volumes and the prices to be applied in this regard, they have relied on their own estimations, resulting in divergent projections of calculations of the ensuing royalty and extraction tax. Moreover, the impact of the Windfall Profit Tax must also be considered in this regard. This matter will have to be examined more closely when the latter tax is analysed.\n\nThe documentation shows that a distinction had been made between \"EHCO Production\" and \"EHCO Fiscalized Production\". The Tribunal's limited documentary evidence does not allow applying such distinction in a consistent manner. It is certain, at least, that the differences in quantity and value are relatively small.\n\nCf. Abdula/Spiller, Preliminary Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 12 September 2008, Appendix D, para. 34; Brailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 140(a), further noting that the formula to be used for the calculation of the reference price was set up in the Ministry Resolution No. 3 dated 11 January 2007, Article 5(e) (Expert Report on Valuation, 18 August 2014, footnote 322, BF-43). The monthly publications from the Ministry have not been filed with the Tribunal.\n\n721.\n\nFor Corocoro, the experts on both sides mention a \"PEG Tax\" equal to 50% of the annual operating income. However, none of the experts went beyond the definition of the rate under Article I of the Association Agreement. Such rate would need to be examined and determined on the basis of Article 9 of the Association Agreement's Accounting Procedures, which have not been looked at by any expert. Without such an analysis, accounting for a PEG rate would be pure speculation.\n\n722.\n\nThe Parties and their experts are at odds about the applicability of the Windfall Profit Tax that was introduced in 2008 and amended since then several times. While this legislation will be examined closely below, another argument of the Respondent can be disposed of now. Indeed, it is argued that the Government had the power and would certainly have decided to exercise it for the purpose of taking additional fiscal measures or any other measure taking away from the foreign partners in the Projects any profit considered as excessive541. This position lacks any serious evidentiary support. There is no need to recall in detail Venezuela's political position during the negotiations of the Association Agreements to protect its sovereign right to take away excessive revenues from the investors. This right was expressly mentioned in the Congressional Authorizations. The compensation provisions were the result of the bargain that was at the centre of the debate between the Parties. These provisions were a reaction to the Government's position to raise taxes when it considered it was not able to share sufficiently in the profits resulting from increasing oil prices. As will be explained below, this had been done through the Windfall Profit Tax. Therefore, there is no point in arguing that more has to apply, based on political declarations, including Dr. Mommer's statements, that have all been made before the Windfall Profit Tax was first enacted. The Respondent knows and must accept that nothing more than the Windfall Profit Tax has been implemented for that purpose and that anything beyond these measures is pure speculation, for today and for the foreseeable future.\n\nCf. Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, para. 138; Respondent's Final Brief on Quantum, para. 263.\n\nB. The Windfall Profit Tax\n--------------------------\n\n*1. The Legal Structure*\n------------------------\n\n723.\n\nThe payment of a \"Special Contribution for Extraordinary Prices in the International Hydrocarbons Market\", called \"Windfall Profit Tax\" or \"Special Contribution\" was enacted for the first time in 2008, by Decree No. 8,807 of 15 April 2008 (R-500, C-252/582). It applied to export or transportation of liquid hydrocarbons abroad when, in respect of any month, the average price of Brent crude exceeds US$ 70 per barrel. The tax was assessed as US$ 0.50 for every dollar that this average price exceeded US$ 70. When this reference price exceeded US$ 100, the tax went up to US$ 0.60 per dollar. The special contribution had to be paid to the National Development Fund (FONDEN). It was to be counted as costs for the purposes of calculating income tax; this means that it was to be accounted like a royalty.\n\n724.\n\nDecree No. 8,163 of 18 April 2011 restructured the windfall tax (R-501, C-587). By reference to a price fixed in the Budget Law, 20% (0.20 per dollar) were to be paid as tax up to a threshold of the monthly average (extraordinary) price of Venezuelan liquid of US$ 70 per barrel. When prices were greater and became \"exorbitant\", but lower than US$ 90 per barrel, the tax went up to 80% for any price between these two amounts, and it went further up to 90% within a margin of US$ 90 to US$ 100, and 95% in respect of any amount above US$ 100.\n\n725.\n\nEffective on 21 February 2013, Decree No. 40,114 modified again the payment structure (R-502, C-600). The initial rate of 20% went up from the Budget Law price to US$ 80 per barrel (extraordinary price). From there, when prices became higher and were considered to be \"exorbitant\", a tax of 80% applied up to the threshold of US$ 100, and above, 90% applied up to the level of US$ 110. When prices went higher, equal or greater than US$ 110, the tax rate was 95%.\n\n726.\n\nDecree No. 8,807 of 15 April 2008 (Art. 2) and the Decree No. 8,163 of 18 April 2011 (Art. 13) provided for the possibility of an exoneration on the part of the National Executive \"in favor of certain exports within the framework of political economy and international cooperation\". Decree No. 40,114 of 20 February 2013 confirmed two cases of exemption mentioned in the 2011 Decree in a slightly modified drafting: (1) In case the oil production results from the implementation of new reservoir development projects, as well as volumes associated with recovery or upgrading projects, or with production remediation projects, declared as such by the Ministry of the Popular Power with authority in the areas of petroleum and mining; (2) the exportation of volumes in implementing International Agreements of cooperation or financing.\n\n727.\n\nA further point of general interest relates to Article 14 that was introduced by Decree No. 8,163 of 18 April 2011 and which reads as follows:\n\nIn order to guarantee the achievement of the purpose of this Decree-Law, a maximum price limit for the calculation and settlement of Royalties, Extraction Tax and Export Registry Tax set forth in the Organic Law of Hydrocarbons is established at the quantity of seventy dollars per barrel (70 US$/bl).\n\nThe effect of this provision was that royalties and extraction tax were not collected to the extent their reference price went above the limit of US$ 70. For any revenue obtained through prices above this amount, the windfall profit tax became the substitute to the payment of royalties and extraction tax. Decree No. 40,114 of 21 February 2013 raised the maximum price limit from US$ 70 to US$ 80. This provision was not noticed by the Claimants or their experts. The Respondent's experts have mentioned that above US$ 70, the royalty and extraction tax have been substituted by the new assessment provided for through the windfall profit tax legislation542. Witness Figuera had noted in respect of Corocoro that with effect as of mid-April 2011, the royalty price was reduced to US$ 70; similarly, the limit went up to US$ 80 as of March 2013 when the Decree's revision of 2013 entered into force543. The Tribunal has not been informed that any change has been made to Article 14 of the WPT Law since 2013.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores, Expert Report on Valuation, 18 August 2014, paras. 205/206; Second Expert Report on Valuation, 7 January 2015, para. 192. Cf. BF-406, Revenues.\n\nThird Supplemental Testimony, 15 August 2014, para. 104, Table 6, further referring to PetroSucre's Tax and Royalty Statement for 2011, where the impact of the royalty price reduction to US$ 70 is recorded (Appendix 84). See also the Statements for 2012 and 2013 (Figuera Appendices 88 and 89).\n\n*2. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n728.\n\nThe Claimants note that Venezuela enacted the so-called \"windfall profit tax\" (WPT) less than a year after its expropriation of the Projects. Venezuela contends that in evaluating the expropriated investments as of the date of the Award, the Tribunal should take into account any postnationalization events that have a negative impact on value, such as increased taxes.\n\n729.\n\nThe Claimants' experts have factored into their cash flow forecasts several taxes of general applicability enacted by Venezuela since its unlawful expropriation. International law requires, however, that the WPT be disregarded, for two main reasons: (a) First, the effect of this special post-expropriation levy was to take away the benefit of much of the increase in value of the investment due to improved market conditions (essentially higher oil prices) between the dates of expropriation and valuation. It is precisely this increase in value that international law reserves for the Claimants in the case of unlawful expropriation. Under international law, States cannot rely on value-depressing measures enacted after a taking to reduce their compensation obligation, particularly where the effect would be to deny the investor the benefit of a date-of-award valuation. (b) Second, and in any event, on the specific facts of this case the WPT cannot be applied, because: (i) the Claimants could have enjoyed an exemption from the application of this special law, just as PDVSA has done; and (ii) the application of this levy to the Claimants' Projects would result in unequal treatment, in breach of Article 4 of the BIT. Each one of the foregoing reasons leads to the same conclusion: the Tribunal should not artificially reduce Venezuela's compensation obligation by assuming the application of this special post-expropriation levy to the Projects in the but-for world.\n\n730.\n\nVenezuela must provide full reparation to compensate the Claimants for the unlawful expropriation of their investments. In such a case, the expropriator's responsibility must be increased by the fact that his action was unlawful. A date-of-award valuation ensures that, where there is an unlawful expropriation, any increase in value since the date of expropriation is retained by the injured investor and not diverted to the breaching State. Venezuela should not be rewarded for depriving the Claimants of the benefit of improved market conditions since the date of expropriation.\n\n731.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Venezuela seeks to negate the Tribunal's holding on the occurrence of an unlawful expropriation by applying the WPT to the expropriated Projects in the but-for-world. The Claimants' experts concluded that the WPT would have reduced the value of the Projects by US$ 4.4 billion. Based on the valuation presented by the Respondent's experts, the reduction would be equal to 49%. The effect produced by Venezuela's position is even clearer when one observes that its date-of-award valuation of US$ 1,463 billion is lower than its date-of-expropriation valuation of US$ 1,872 billion. Venezuela attempts to subvert the principle of full compensation through the application of the WPT, and thereby to reach an outcome even worse for the investor than one resulting from a lawful taking. To allow Venezuela to insulate itself in this manner from the consequences of its own wrongful actions would be perverse. It would allow any State that committed an unlawful expropriation to avoid the financial consequences of its acts by subsequently taxing away the very increase in value to which the investor is entitled under a date-of-award valuation.\n\n732.\n\nThe Claimants also mention that recently, the tribunal in *Yukos* confirmed that the victim of an unlawful expropriation \"must enjoy the benefits\" and receive the value that any improved market conditions may have added to the expropriated asset up to the date of the award544. Venezuela relies on another part of the *Yukos* award, where the tribunal considered the likelihood of future rate increases for certain existing taxes and duties in connection with its assessment of preaward damages. However, the award noted that prior to the expropriation (a) the investor had already been paying those taxes, and (b) their rates had increased several times, which made similar rate increases likely in the future. That situation is radically distinguishable from the facts here. It is an altogether different proposition that under international law Venezuela can keep for itself billions of dollars that market conditions added to the Claimants' investments after the expropriation.\n\n*Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation*, PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award dated 18 July 2014 (R-425).\n\n733.\n\nThe Claimants' also submit that their damages in any event cannot be reduced on account of the WPT because in the but-for world the Claimants would have enjoyed an exemption from the application of this special levy, just as PDVSA and other companies have done.\n\n734.\n\nFirst, the WPT Laws have excluded from their scope any exports to States with which Venezuela has entered into \"international cooperation or financing agreements\". The list of Exempt States is extensive. Thus, in the but-for scenario, the Projects would have directed their exports, if necessary, to one or more Exempt States to bring those exports within the scope of the exemption. Press reports indicate that PDVSA avoided US$ 11.2 billion of WPT in 2013, suggesting that 57% of PDVSA's exports were exempt from the WPT Laws pursuant to Article 12.2. Venezuela's International Agreements with Exempt States such as China and Russia have created joint ventures that are guaranteed an Article 12.2 exemption from the 2011 WPT Law. These same joint ventures are also accorded \"fiscal incentives\". Venezuela has not produced information in this respect, but press reports indicate that they may include exemptions from the 2011 WPT Law.\n\n735.\n\nSecond, the 2011 WPT Law excludes from its scope any exports from projects engaged in \"enhanced oil recovery\" (EOR), and this without time limitation (that was removed through the 2013 amendment of the law). The Claimants could and would have sought to implement EOR technology at both the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects, in particular \"Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage\" (SAGD). PDVSA itself has recognized the value of such technologies. PDVSA subsidiaries and a large number of *empresas mixtas* have benefited from this exemption for EOR.\n\n736.\n\nThird, the Projects could have significantly reduced their potential exposure to the WPT by selling production locally in Venezuela.\n\n737.\n\nFourth, the Projects could have reduced their exposure to the WPT by making \"royalty inkind\" payments, by paying volumes of hydrocarbons towards royalties owed. Petropiar (Hamaca) had apparently benefited from such payments.\n\n738.\n\nThe Claimants' submission is that their position is strengthened further by Venezuela's conduct in the disclosure phase, when it refused to produce all responsive documents relating to the WPT exemptions and how they have been applied. It is clear that PDVSA, and *empresas mixtas* have all been able to escape in significant part any application of the WPT Laws.\n\n739.\n\nThe Claimants note that Venezuela does not deny that they may have applied for certain exemptions, but that its answer is simply that this is speculation and that Venezuela would never have granted exemptions to the Claimants after they had refused to migrate in the mixed company regime. For the Claimants, this argument is unavailing. (a) Exemptions are not to be \"granted\". Once the Claimants complied with the requirements, they would have been entitled to the relevant exemptions by operation of law. (b) Venezuela's argument that the relevant exemptions could only be enjoyed by the mixed companies is incorrect. It follows from the text of Article 12.2 of the WPT Law that the exemption contained therein applies to any export to one or more Exempt States. Venezuela's suggestion that it would have penalized the Claimants and denied them one right because they refused to surrender another one lacks any integrity. In sum, in the but-for world the Claimants could - and rationally would - have been able to take advantage of the various exemptions from the application of the WPT.\n\n740.\n\nFinally, the Claimants affirm that it is common ground that the WPT is subject to the provisions of Article 4 of the BIT, which ensures that, with respect to any tax or exemption thereto, it will not accord more favorable treatment to its own nationals (National Treatment) or the nationals of third States (MFN). Given that PDVSA (and its affiliates) and other enterprises have all been able to enjoy an exemption from the application of the WPT, Venezuela's position in this arbitration would result in the Claimants being accorded less favorable treatment. In such a case, the unlawful conduct of the State must be disregarded for valuation purposes.\n\n741.\n\nThe many exemptions provided under the WPT demonstrate a *prima facie* case of discrimination, which shifts to the State the burden to prove that no discrimination has taken place. Venezuela cannot discharge that burden here, in particular given its manifestly incomplete production of documents.\n\n742.\n\nFirst, Venezuela argues that the Claimants were not in \"like circumstances\", given the fact that they had \"a unique contractual framework\". This argument collapses when compared to the law. When complying with the requirements, the Claimants would have been entitled to an exemption from the WPT by operation of the law. There is no distinction between entities operating based on a contract or entities controlled or owed by the State or a State-owned company. Venezuela has no difficulty in taking the position that the Claimants are subject to the WPT, despite their special \"contractual\" grounding, but it then relies on the same argument for its position that the Claimants are not subject to the law's exemptions.\n\n743.\n\nSecond, Venezuela argues that the WPT would put the Claimants in a less favorable position than the terms of the Association Agreements. The simple answer is that the statute does not make any difference depending on the contractual arrangements of a concerned entity. Venezuela cannot apply the statute differently to different investors.\n\n744.\n\nThird, Venezuela contends that the Claimants cannot show a preferential treatment based on nationality, because both Dutch and non-Dutch investors received windfall profit tax exemptions. This proposition ignores the very purpose of the MFN standard, which is to protect all investors from discriminatory treatment. A State simply cannot immunize itself from liability by discriminating against some but not all investors.\n\n*3. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n745.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimants' position that their claim entitles them to the benefit of post-expropriation increases in value, and that the taxes would deprive them of such benefit. Nothing in the *Chorz\u00f3w* decision or anywhere else grants the Claimants immunity from fiscal charges or other post-expropriation events that they do not like. The windfall profits taxes enacted by Venezuela are a legitimate and valid exercise of sovereign taxing authority. Changing circumstances in the international oil industry have prompted governments all over the world to enact fiscal and regulatory changes, including windfall profit taxes, to respond to dramatically increasing oil prices. There is no merit to the Claimants' allegations that Venezuela is trying to \"insulate\" itself and \"negate\" the effects of the Tribunal's ruling on unlawful expropriation by applying the windfall profits taxes in its valuation. The Claimants also accuse the Respondent of enacting these taxes specially to reduce the valuation in this Arbitration, but the laws were obviously not enacted for that purpose. The fact is that the new tax had a broad scope of application in the country's oil sector and that Venezuela has collected approximately US$ 12 billion of such taxes in the period 2008 to 2013.\n\n746.\n\nThe 2011 and the 2013 amendments of the Law contained certain categories of exemptions for (i) activities related to the execution of new projects, (ii) activities to increase production by enhanced recovery in ongoing projects, (iii) export volumes in implementation of international cooperation or financing agreements, and (iv) remediation activities. Exemptions must be approved in each instance, subject to the discretion of the Ministry of Petroleum. A 2013 Ministry directive clarified that (i) base production from ongoing production of existing wells is not eligible for exemptions; (ii) only the volumes of production that result from enhanced recovery activities (including new wells) are eligible for exemptions; and (iii) maintenance activities do not qualify as exemption (R-503, C-615). The Claimants' projects were obviously not eligible for exemptions under the \"new\" projects category. Exemptions for enhanced recovery or remediation activities were limited to the specific portion of production resulting from such activities; an exemption would not apply to the Projects as a whole. The Claimants' assertions that they could have modified their operations in order to be exempted for \"new projects\" categories are mere speculation.\n\n747.\n\nThere is no basis to expect that the Claimants would be granted any exemptions from windfall profits taxes. Having refused to migrate, it is not credible to assume that they would have nevertheless been granted exemptions from windfall profits taxes. The Claimants' argument that in such a case, they would be discriminated against in violation of Article 4 of the Dutch Treaty is unavailing. This provision addresses nationality-based discrimination between investors who are in like circumstances. In the absence of such discrimination, there is no violation. The essential factor is being placed in \"like circumstances,\" when the treatment of a host State national or of a third State national is compared. It is the Claimants' burden to establish all elements of the test. The Claimants did not establish their hypothetical Article 4 claim under anyone of the required elements. They cannot show that the allegedly preferred investors were similarly situated. Thus, merely engaging in activities in the hydrocarbons industry, for instance, is not sufficient. The Claimants cannot be compared to investors engaged in new projects that are in the initial stages, nor can they be compared to investors in old projects. The Claimants had a unique contractual framework, created under the entirely different, pre-migration regulatory framework. None of the mixed companies has compensation provisions in their contracts such as the ones in the Association Agreements.\n\n748.\n\nThe Claimants cannot demonstrate that the windfall profits tax exemptions made other projects more favorable than the terms of the Association Agreements. In any event, the Claimants have made it quite clear that they did not want to accept the migration. They cannot show the allegedly preferential treatment applied on the basis of nationality. On the contrary, the record is clear that both Dutch and non-Dutch investors received windfall profits tax exemptions. Further, different treatment does not violate MFN or national treatment obligations if there is an objective, rational basis or policy justifying the treatment. The petroleum industry is of critical importance to Venezuela's economy. It was both rational and legitimate for the State to use fiscal incentives as a method of ensuring the vitality of that sector. Finally, MFN obligations are \"without prejudice to the freedom of contract\". Just as the Claimants obtained unique contractual arrangements, other investors may obtain other arrangements, and the State does not thereby violate MFN or national treatment obligations.\n\n749.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimants have no answer to the fact that, as testified by Dr. Mommer, if the 2007 Nationalization had not occurred, the Government would have, and legally could have, taken additional fiscal measures to increase \"government take\". That is what Dr. Mom-mer had in mind when he described the compensation mechanism as a \"contractually defined boundary for excess profit taxation\". To compensate the Claimants as if they were immune from such measure would not be a \"but-for\" world exercise; it would be endowing the Claimants with benefits they never dreamed of obtaining when they entered into the Projects. Another limit is accepted: \"The Government has the right to introduce fiscal measures provided that they are not expropriatory\"545.\n\nTR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 6, p. 1635:9-11 (Kahale).\n\n750.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants argument on the windfall profits taxes is both factually incorrect and legally unsustainable on multiple grounds. The Claimants' entire argument on this issue misses the main point, which is that not only would the windfall profits taxes as they were enacted have been applied in the Claimants' \"but-for\" world, but the Government undoubtedly would have exercised its full sovereign rights to enact additional taxes to capture all excess profits resulting from high oil prices, up to the limit established in the compensation mechanisms established by the price caps agreed for the upgrading projects. While the Tribunal can assume that the State would not have exceeded those limits, thereby triggering the State company's indemnification obligation, it can also safely assume that the State would not have favored the associations that did not wish to accept the new mixed company structure with any more favorable tax treatment than was bargained for at the outset of those projects.\n\n*4. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\n751.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the Claimants' view that a date-of-award valuation must ensure that, where there is an unlawful expropriation, any increase in value since the date of expropriation is retained by the injured investor and not diverted to the breaching State. The Claimants should not be deprived of the benefit of improved market conditions. However, such a broad statement mixes the notions of value and benefit. The Claimants argue as if gross revenue alone counts; they do not take account of any decrease in value occurring since the date of expropriation, remaining immune from increase in costs, and ignoring completely any variation in the tax regime.\n\n752.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the expropriation effective on 26 June 2007 was directed against the Association Agreements governing each of the three Projects. The content of the taking was composed of the laws and obligations enshrined in these foundations of the Projects. This necessarily means that any provision relevant for identifying the taxation regime of the Projects is part of what has been \"taken\", with the effect that the aggrieved party claiming compensation cannot claim more than what it was expected to receive on the basis of the relevant Association Agreement.\n\n753.\n\nSince the time of negotiation of the Association Agreements, it was settled that the Government accepted to reduce under certain conditions and within limits that were matter of debate between the Parties the applicable royalties, governmental contributions and taxes. In the framework of the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements relating to Petrozuata and Hamaca, it was clearly established during the negotiations and within express clauses of the Congressional Authorizations that the Venezuelan Government remained completely autonomous in the exercise of its sovereign power, including in particular its power to fix the tax regime of the partners in the Association Agreements546.\n\nFor instance, Condition Sixteen of the Congressional Authorization of the Petrozuata Project (C-10A, R-21/92) provided that the provisions of the Association Agreement, and in particular its regime for compensation in case of discriminatory treatment, shall be \"without prejudice to the sovereign right to legislate inherent in the very existence of the national, state and municipal legislative branches\". The corresponding Authorization for Hamaca stated in its Condition Nineteen: \"The Association Agreement, the creation and operation of the Entities and other activities shall not impose any obligation on the Republic of Venezuela or restrict its exercise of sovereign rights,...\" (R-93, C-132).\n\n754.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that modifications in the tax regime based on the Government's sovereign power were included in what is called the but-for phase of the Projects, subject to potential compensation under the appropriate provisions of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements.\n\n755.\n\nAdditionally, it had also been made clear during the negotiations that the Government's ability to increase the tax burden of the Projects was directly connected to the increase in oil prices. The Government will have its part of the increase in profit resulting from more favorable market conditions for the sale of oil. Even if the Tribunal accepts the Claimants' assertion that, as victims of an unlawful expropriation, they were entitled to enjoy the benefits of the Projects including those resulting from improved market conditions, these benefits did not include a complete release from any increase in the tax regime. Quite the contrary. Such increase in taxes was part of the but-for scenario, as it was also part of an *ex ante* valuation (subject to the difficulty of estimating the increase of taxes to be expected).\n\n756.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the Claimants' position that they were victims of a new tax regime which specifically targeted them for the purpose of reducing their aspiration for compensation resulting from increased oil prices since 2007 does not find support in the legislation and its practical application, nor in the Parties' respective positions in this proceeding. The Government's policy had been clearly communicated to them at that time: The objective was to offer a tax incentive for Development Projects and operators increasing their production until they have recovered their investment547; this does not imply a target directed against the Claimants. The Respondent has produced a PDVSA 2013 Management Report demonstrating that over the years 2008 to 2013, an amount of US$ 12,280 million had been collected as Special Contribution under the WPT Laws, with an average of around US$ 3,5 million in the years 2011 to 2013 (R-499). PDVSA's Financial Statements for the years 2011-2013 note amounts in millions of US$ 13,247 (2011), 14,994 (2012) and 10,435 (2013)548. The Claimants did not object to these figures. If the WPT were directed directly against the Claimants, the PDVSA Offering Circular of 8 November 2013 could not be written without any indication of such purpose. The Circular explains549 that about US$ 60 million had been funded as social contribution between 2010 and June 2013; this amount is far above what would have been expected as the three Projects' contribution.\n\nCf. Minister Ram\u00edrez quoted in a PDVSA report of April 2011, C-589; Reuters articles of the same time, C-588, C590.\n\nPDVSA, Consolidated Financial Statements, 2013, 2012, 2011 (C-616, p. 38/pdf). The contribution for 2010 was US$ 392 million; PDVSA, Consolidated Financial Statements, 2012, 2011, 2010 (C-562, p. 41). The respective amounts for 2008 and 2009 were US$ 14,733 and 1,865 million; PDVSA Annual Report 2009, p. 794; this Report contains a list of the projects supported by FONDEN in 2009 (p. 801). The PDVSA Annual Report for 2015 (CLEX-090) contains a list of all annual contributions to FONDEN from 2006 to 2015; the numbers for 2014 are US$ MM 10,400 and for 2015 US$ MM 976 (page 92).\n\nC-610, p. 10, 30, 41, 90.\n\n757.\n\nThe Claimants argue correctly that the issue is whether Venezuela could reduce its liability for a wrongful act on the basis of another wrongful act550. However, in answering this question in the negative, it is by no means established that the WPT was a wrongful act. The foreign investor entered into a contractual relationship that had as its very basis the possible increase in taxes resulting from increasing oil prices, combined with the relief for compensation in case of a discriminatory action. The Claimants cannot claim the benefit of increasing oil prices after the expropriation while refusing the State's increase of taxes, which may trigger the compensation mechanism, agreed between all partners specifically for such a situation. The rates applicable under the WPT Laws were far below a level where they would have deprived the Claimants of the profit resulting from increasing oil prices. The situation was also considerably less dramatic given the fact that the amendment of 2013 had the effect of reducing the tax burden of the oil companies551. Finally, because the WPT was treated as a royalty and not as an income tax, it had the effect of reducing the latter tax by 50%; its financial impact was therefore reduced to half of its nominal terms552. The impact of the WPT was also softened by the effects of Article 14 (not observed by the Claimants), reducing the royalty reference price to US$ 70, and later US$ 80.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 18, p. 5179:9-5186:17 (Partasides).\n\nThe effect of this decrease was explained in PDVSA's Offering Circular of 8 November 2013 (C-610, p. 4, 35); the decrease between the first six months of the years 2012 and 2013 was US$ 3,810 million (from 6,447 to 2,637).\n\nTherefore, there is no point in claiming that Venezuela introduced a selective tax that attempted to transfer the billions of value of the investment to itself, thus rendering the concept of unlawful expropriation meaningless; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 15, p. 4387:14-20, 4388:5-10 (Friedman).\n\n758.\n\nWhen the Claimants mentioned in their Memorial submitted on 15 September 2008 the first version of the WPT553, as approved on 15 April 2008, they did not contend that the new tax had for its purpose to capture any future compensation owed to the investors in the three Projects. Such an intention appears all the more so artificial in light of the fact that at that time ConocoPhillips and the Venezuelan Government were still involved in trying to negotiate compensation for the expropriation that had taken place on 26 June 2007, thus avoiding an arbitral proceeding that had been launched by the Claimants on 2 November 2007554.\n\nMemorial, paras. 253/254.\n\nCf. Interim Decision, paras. 94-131.\n\n759.\n\nThe Claimants correctly submit that exports to States with which Venezuela has entered into \"international cooperation or financing agreements\" would have been an opportunity for exclusion from the WPT Laws. The fact is, however, that no such agreement had been concluded that could have attracted export of oil from the Projects to one of the exempted States. And as the examples of Russia (C-583) and China (C-585, C-601, C-622) demonstrate, such agreements imply a substantial payment from the foreign State (2.2 billion in the case of Russia, and a 900 million bonus from China), for which the WPT exemption constituted a counterpart. The Claimants do not present more than a mere hypothesis of their involvement in such an international agreement, without considering the additional investment that would have been required to obtain the further advantage of being taken out from the scope of WPT. In a but-for scenario, there is no incentive that would have made such an exception agreement attractive for Venezuela, with the effect of rendering the financial equation fixed through the Association Agreements more favorable to the foreign investors.\n\n760.\n\nThe Claimants' submission that they would have obtained exclusions from the WPT Law on the basis of EOR technology they thought to implement is based on very weak grounds in light of the uncertain future of such technology within the framework of the Association Agreements. More information and evidence would be needed to demonstrate that the supplemental investment required for such technology would off-set the tax payments required under the WPT. In any event, the main part of the production under the Projects would not have been conducted through such modern technology that is the only one that would benefit from an exemption. It must be recalled, indeed, that the exemption did apply to specific projects only, covering in one of the examples referred to by the Claimants steam injection supplied to a set of 5 wells in 2012 and 104 in 2013 (C-615/618), whereas in another, concerning PetroPiar, an exemption was granted in 2013 for a period between April and December 2011 in the amount of about US$ 24 million, leaving a remaining tax amount of US$ 320 million for the same period (R-519, C-606). No exemption could be expected for cold production and for maintenance, which were the Projects' major activities555.\n\nPDVSA received exemptions in the amount of US$ million 1,583 (2013), 3,712 (2012) and 1,585 (2011); PDVSA, Consolidated Financial Statements, 2013, 2012, 2011 (C-616, p. 38/pdf). In the years 2012 and 2013 it received a Government grant for US$ 5,241, respectively 6,683 million, which appears in the accounts as a reimbursement through FONDEN (*ibidem*).\n\n761.\n\nThere may have been an opportunity to reduce the exposure to the WPT by selling more oil on the domestic market. However, the Projects were manifestly oriented to sales of oil abroad, oversea. The Claimants refrain from any attempt to quantify the volumes that they would have sold locally with the benefit of being exempted from the WPT556. Equally unsupported is the argument that royalty-in-kind payments could have been made. In such a case, the State would have to be interested; no such evidence has been provided for such a perspective557. The example of PetroPiar that is supposed to be an \"apparent\" benefit of this kind is unsupported by the evidence submit-ted558.\n\nThe Claimants' experts apply the export tax on the basis of the total revenue from the sales, making no discount for sales on the domestic market; cf. CLEX-086, Revenues. The Respondent's experts adopt the same position; cf. BF-406, Contractual FCF.\n\nThe Claimants do not observe that such a change in production would imply a decrease in upgrading and costs for the installation of the facilities to deal with Mesa and Merey and to deliver crude oil as royalty payment. The matter had been examined at the Hamaca Board of Directors Meeting of 23 February 2006, upon a proposal made by PDVSA, when ConocoPhillips expressed concerns about the possibility of causing longer term reservoir problems and costs, and further noted that it would be necessary to assure that long term benefits would not be sacrificed for short term benefits (C-342, p. 3/4). Reluctance was equally voiced at the Hamaca Operations Committee Meeting of 8 February 2006 (Figuera Appendix 50, p. 4/5).\n\nFinancial Statements, CLEX-094, p. 143, 186, 232/pdf.\n\n762.\n\nThe Claimants complain that Venezuela refused in the disclosure phase to produce all responsive documents relating to the WPT exemptions and how they have been applied. The Tribunal accepts that PDVSA and *empresas mixtas* have been able to be exempted in significant part from the application of the WPT Laws. The Tribunal observes, however, when screening the Financial Statements of the *empresas mixtas* that have taken over Petrozuata and Hamaca, that these Projects have paid substantial amounts to the FONDEN, the entity collecting the special contribution. The Tribunal also finds that the examination of the main options for exemption has shown that the Projects, in a but-for scenario, had little or no chance to benefit in any significant part from being exempted from the payment of the special contribution. And even if there would have been an opening for exemption, the Claimants provide no estimate, nor any evidence, of the amounts of WPT they would have been able to save had they remained in the Projects. Moreover, even if it is true that the Respondent did not disclose all documents it was requested to submit559, the Claimants did not show whether and to what extent such additional documentation would have demonstrated that it had any more opportunity to obtain exemptions from the WPT Law in the future560 or the amounts that it would have allegedly saved. For instance, the presentation of all relevant cooperation agreements with foreign countries does not assist in proving that the Claimants would have had the benefit of such an agreement under the prevailing conditions based on the Association Agreements.\n\nFor a list of the documents disclosed, cf. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 19 May 2017, para. 203.\n\nCf. Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, 19 May 2017, para. 199.\n\n763.\n\nGiven the above conclusion, the Claimants' argument that when complying with the requirements, they would have been entitled to an exemption from the WPT by operation of law, cannot succeed. In addition, Article 12.1 of the WPT on exemption for revenues resulting from new projects states expressly that the applicable parameters will be established by the Ministry, and that the decision will result from a declaration of the Ministry, which means that this Governmental authority enjoys some discretion to accept or deny an exemption in a particular case. Similarly, exports in the framework of political economy and international cooperation are subject to partial or total exoneration on the part of the National Executive (Art. 13), which means that the Government acts in its own discretion. The only more affirmative provision is Article 12.2, providing for an exemption in case of exportation implemented in International Agreements of cooperation or financing; this must be so for the simple reason that the exemption is part of such agreement. When considering this legal framework, applicants for WPT exemptions must expect to be treated differently, depending on whether or not they comply with the legal and administrative requirements. Contrary to the Claimants' position, there is no case for being placed from the outset in \"like circumstances\", as opposed to \"discriminatory treatment\".\n\n764.\n\nIt may happen therefore that the WPT would put the Claimants in a less favorable position than the terms of the Association Agreements, or vice-versa. Contrary to the Claimants' view, the statute may make a difference depending on the contractual arrangements of a concerned entity, for instance in relation to its ability to introduce steam-injection technology. The very terms of the statutory exemptions demonstrate that the statute can be applied differently to different investors, depending upon whether or not they comply with the full set of requirements.\n\n765.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while the Claimants insist on having been treated less favorably than other investors who had taken advantage of the available exemptions, they nonetheless do not rely on the very specific provisions on discriminatory action contained in the Association Agreements of Petrozuata and Hamaca. In fact, these provisions may, if the applicable requirements are fulfilled, provide for a legal treatment different from the Claimants' understanding of the WPT and applicable under a but-for scenario561.\n\nCf. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 19 May 2017, paras. 198-201, 210, 216, noting that the compensation provisions would be relevant if the Windfall Profit Tax would be considered as a Discriminatory Action. This has been denied because increases in royalties are allegedly not discriminatory; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 15, p. 4493:124495:2 (Kahale). However, the opposite solution was also accepted as possible; TR-E, *ibidem*, p. 4533:4-4534:5 (Kahale).\n\n766.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the Windfall Profit Tax would have been applicable to the Projects. No case for an exemption has been demonstrated or supported by evidence. The potential relevance of the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements of Petrozuata and Hamaca remains to be examined at a later stage. At this juncture, the accounting impact of the WPT Law has to be determined. It results from the legal structure explained above. The Law and its subsequent amendments operate by layers setting thresholds and margins determining the applicable percentage of the tax. The Law operates a distinction between extraordinary prices and exorbitant prices. The first type of price is determined by reference to the difference between the Venezuelan Budget Price and the Venezuelan liquid hydrocarbons basket. The second type of price is defined as a percentage between two prices serving as borderline for each of several categories going up from the Budget Price to different levels of prices as stated in the Law.\n\n767.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants' experts were instructed not to examine the Windfall Profit Tax. They must have done so nevertheless because they reported to the Tribunal that whether or not the WPT is applied, the difference in taxation is 21%, which would be in the Claimants' case a reduction compared to the Respondent's position562. They also included in their 2016 December Full Valuation a section on the windfall tax, which follows in large part the presentation prepared by the Respondent's experts563. The Tribunal notes that while the Claimants object to the application of the WPT in the present case, they did not raise objections to the application as it has been submitted by the Respondent's experts in their reports and in their calculations as per December 2016564. This is mainly of concern for the fixing of the Venezuelan Budget Price and the Venezuelan liquid hydrocarbons basket565. The Tribunal further observes that the figures mentioned below reflect the production and the sales as presented above, including the prices stated which are all different from those on which the Parties rely. In particular, the Tribunal will not retain a flat rate for prices relevant in later years of the Projects.\n\nAbdala/Spiller, Rebuttal Report, 21 April 2016, para. 55; Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, footnote 12; TR-E, 2017 February Hearing, Day 6, p. 1714:4-1716:4 (Spiller); Claimants' 2017 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 189.\n\nCLEX-086, Windfall, referring to BF-333/335; Abdala/Spiller, Damage Assessment, Presentation, 27 March 2017, slide 27.\n\nBF-406, Special Contribution.\n\nIn respect of this basket price also see the Respondent's experts' *Ex Post* Analyses and Projections Calculations as of 31 December 2016, BF-Appendix 408.\n\n768.\n\nNonetheless, the fixing of the Budget Price requires special attention. This price represents the minimum threshold that triggers the tax rate as soon as and to the extent that the Venezuelan Basket price reaches a higher amount. The Venezuelan Basket represents an average price assessed on the basis of actual oil prices. In the present case, this Basket is in most years very close to the actual prices at which oil was sold in the three Projects566. The Budget Price has another function because it determines the minimum level at which the WPT can operate. It contains an important political component of the structure of the windfall profit tax.\n\nFor this reason and for the purpose of remaining consistent with the Tribunal's assessment of the future oil prices, the Tribunal proceeds with an adjustment of the Venezuelan Basket price on the same lines. In particular, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's experts' method based on flat rates in respect of this Basket as from year 2021; cf. BF-408.\n\n769.\n\nFor instance, when the WPT Law became operational in 2008, the Budget Price was set at US$ 70 whereas the average Venezuelan Basket was US$ 89.55. Article 1 of the Law fixed a tax rate of 50% that was to be applied to the difference between this Budget Price and this Basket, *i.e.* US$ 9.77. In other years, the Budget Law set the Budget Price at a lower level, *e.g.* 40, 50, or 60 US$, with the effect that the basis for taxation of extraordinary prices was extended, when considering a hypothesis where the Venezuelan Basket remains constant. The determination of the Budget Price is thus a key element for the assessment of the WPT applicable to extraordinary prices (the latter being set at US$ 70 and later US$ 80).\n\n770.\n\nThe information available on the Tribunal's record as to the method of setting the Budget Price for each year is poor. The Tribunal can accept the Budget Prices provided by the Respondent's experts for the historical period until the end of 2016 as realistic; the Claimants' experts did not raise objections in this respect although they must have had access to the relevant information that is in the public domain. For the years 2017 to 2020, the Respondent's experts retain a Budget Price of US$ 40567. For the years following 2020, they preserve the same rate as a flat rate, staying with the method they have adopted with other oil prices. In respect of the Budget Price, such option is particularly inappropriate. When a flat rate is applied to market rates in the future, it may be argued that the evolution of the market prices is so uncertain that the median rate may most appropriately be set at a flat level. With regard to the Budget Price, the situation is different. This price certainly has a relation to market prices, but it is above all a political reference, because it fixes the minimum threshold from which the WPT on extraordinary prices intervenes. Whether the Budget Price is set, for instance, at US$ 40 or 60 has the impact that the layer for the WPT of 20% for extraordinary prices applies to the price segment between US$ 40 to 70, or 60 to 70, which makes a difference of US$ 4 for each dollar income.\n\nCf. BF-406, Special Contribution, filed together with Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016; BF-333, Table 5, filed together with Valuation Update, 18 March 2016.\n\n771.\n\nA cursory look at the rare budget explanations found on the Tribunal's record demonstrates the political and economic component of the Budget Price. When this price was set at US$ 60 in the years 2014 and 2015, it was said that with such price, the expectations and the uncertainties of the international oil market were valued, also taking into account the vulnerability of oil prices568. For these two years, the Venezuelan Basket Price was US$ 88.54 in 2014 and US$ 44.69 in 2015. Noting the decrease of prices in 2015, the Government must have been sensitive to the potential over pricing of the Budget Price in 2015. This had a strong consequence in year 2016, when the Basket Price went down to US$ 32.02: The Government took the Budget Price down to US$ 40, explaining this was a consequence of the decrease of crude oil prices on international markets569. This experience demonstrates that a Budget Price of US$ 40 is manifestly linked to a period of low market prices, when the Government must be careful not to raise taxes above reasonable proportions. The stability of the fiscal regime confronted with highly volatile pricing was also a consideration. Thus, when the Budget Price was set at US$ 40 in 2011, it was with the intention of taking maximum profit from increasing prices570, but this approach was then corrected in 2012 when it was noted that a more prudent approach was to be preferred, resulting in a price level of US$ 50571 that was further raised to US$ 55 in year 2013572, before it went up again in 2014 to US$ 60. Therefore, when in years after 2016, prices went up or can be expected to go up again it is unconvincing to retain a low Budget Price of US$ 40 for all future years as a flat rate. The Respondent's experts have no explanation for their assumption that such a flat price would apply until the end of the life of the Projects. Their position is untenable when contrasted to the Budget Price the same experts had adopted two years earlier: Indeed, in their calculations annexed to their Second Report of 7 January 2015573 and to their Expert Report of 18 August 2014574, the Budget Price was set at a flat level of US$ 60 as from 2014 and until the end of the Projects. Therefore, these experts' own assumptions support a view that the Budget Price of US$ 40 was exceptional for the low-price year of 2016, while prices as experienced in 2014 and 2015 (between US$ 45 and 90) can have the effect of raising the Budget Price to the level of about US$ 60, in order not to overcharge the financial benefit of oil production in Venezuela. The Tribunal concludes that the most reasonable assumption of the Budget Prices retained as from year 2017 is US$ 60, which corresponds to the actual price in the years 2014 and 2015 and to the amount the Respondent's experts have envisaged before oil prices crashed in 2016. The Tribunal further notes that all the pertinent knowledge and experience related to the assessment of the Budget Price in years later than 2016, including its political component, lies in the hands of the Government of Venezuela appearing as the Respondent in the present case. The Respondent is thus fully aware of the relevance of the appropriate determination of the Budget Price and it had the opportunity to provide the Tribunal with evidence beyond its experts' speculations.\n\nCf. Explanations provided with the draft law for the fiscal year 2014 (BF-049, page 23) and 2015 (BF-384, page 21).\n\nCf. the television report dated 1 December 2015, page 2 (BF-385).\n\nCf. Explanations provided with the draft law for the fiscal year 2011 (BF-045, page 23).\n\nCf. Explanations provided with the draft law for the fiscal year 2012 (BF-046, page 23).\n\nCf. Explanations provided with the draft law for the fiscal year 2013 (BF-048, page 23).\n\nAppendix BF-210, Table 5, filed together with Brailovsky/Flores, Second Expert Report on Valuation, 7 January 2015.\n\nAppendix BF-004, Table 5, attached to Expert Report on Valuation, 18 August 2014. This Report mentions in footnote 328 that this choice had been made, without further explanation.\n\n772.\n\nOne other point remains. The Respondent's experts recognized that the WPT substitutes its rates to the rates for royalty and extraction tax above a threshold of US$ 70 and, respectively, US$ 80575. They applied these amounts as the maximum limit, in case the actual royalty reference price based on the Ministry's price formula was higher. This occurred in fact in the high price period from 2011 to 2014 only, whereas in the other years, prices stayed below this threshold. Such a calculation avoids double taxation: The royalty rate of 33.33% is applied on the basis of the total EHCO production, whereas the WPT is applied by reference to the total volume of upgraded oil sold. Article 14 WPT Law requires the separation of the two regimes along the line fixed by the above-mentioned threshold. Below prices of US$ 70 (or US$ 80 as from 2013), the royalty and extraction tax of 33.33% applies; above that limit, this rate is ineffective and replaced by the rates determined by the WPT Law. This price represents the lowest threshold of what the WPT Law qualifies as \"exorbitant prices\". Prices below that level but still above the Budget Law price fixed for each fiscal year are called \"extraordinary prices\" where a tax rate of 20% applies (Art. 7) together with the royalty and extraction tax. Above that limit, each of the two tax regimes operates separately. The Tribunal will therefore retain the reference price for Royalties at the appropriate stage as it results from Article 14 of the WPT Law.\n\nThe Respondent's experts' presentation is not without confusion. In their updated compensation calculation filed with their Second Report dated 7 January 2015, the royalty reference price of US$ 70, later US$ 80, is taken into account (BF-210, Table 4; see also BF-005, Table 4). However, the report itself notes that the royalties are not capped at the prices established by the windfall profit legislation (cf. Second Expert Report on Valuation, 7 January 2015, footnote 315). In the calculation appended to the Consolidated Brief of November 2016, the limits of US$ 70 and US$ 80 are mentioned as \"Reference Price Adjustment by B&F (Cap)\"; cf. BF-406, Revenues. The calculations in Appendix 408 do not mention the Royalty price resulting from Article 14 WPT. The experts never mention this provision.\n\n773.\n\nThe calculated terms of the application of the WPT on each of the Projects are as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | WPT - Petrozuata |\n|  | MMB | Total Income US$ | Sales Price US$ | Venezuela Basket | Budget Price576 | Rate577 | Tax US$ |\n| 2007 \u00bd | 15,568,593 | 1,091,981,113 | 70.14 |  |  |  | -- |\n| 2008 | 35,700,904 | 3,119,544,992 | 87.38 | 89.55 | 70 | 6.15578 | 219,560,559 |\n| 2009 | 36,200,000 | 2,008,738,000 | 55.49 | 56.48 | 70 | -- | 0 |\n| 2010 | 36,200,000 | 2,574,756,000 | 70.38 | 71.57 | 70 | 0.19 | 68,780 |\n| 2011 | 36,200,000 | 3,635,204,000 | 100.42 | 100.66 | 40 | 26.68579 | 965,816,000 |\n| 2012 | 36,200,000 | 3,670,318,000 | 101.39 | 103.37 | 50 | 32.20 | 1,165,640,000 |\n| 2013 | 36,200,000 | 3,637,738,000 | 100.49 | 101.22 | 55 | 23.10580 | 836,220,000 |\n| 2014 | 36,200,000 | 3,201,528,000 | 88.44 | 88.54 | 60 | 10.80 | 390,960,000 |\n| 2015 | 36,200,000 | 1,565,288,000 | 43.24 | 44.69 | 60 |  | 0 |\n| 2016 | 36,200,000 | 1,158,762,000 | 32.01 | 32.02 | 40 |  | 0 |\n| 2017 | 36,200,000 | 1,706,468,000 | 47.14 | 48.42 | 60 |  | 0 |\n| 2018 | 36,200,000 | 1,921,496,000 | 53.08 | 54.51 | 60 |  | 0 |\n| 2019 | 36,200,000 | 1,960,230,000 | 54.15 | 55.62 | 60 |  | 0 |\n| 2020 | 36,200,000 | 2,100,324,000 | 58.02 | 59.59 | 60 |  | 0 |\n| 2021 | 36,200,000 | 2,143,764,000 | 59.22 | 60.79 | 60 | 0.15 | 54,300 |\n| 2022 | 36,200,000 | 2,187,204,000 | 60.42 | 61.99 | 60 | 0.39 | 141,180 |\n| 2023 | 36,200,000 | 2,230,644,000 | 61.62 | 63.19 | 60 | 0.63 | 228,060 |\n| 2024 | 26,600,000 | 1,671,012,000 | 62.82 | 64.39 | 60 | 0.87 | 231,420 |\n| 2025 | 22,100,000 | 1,414,842,000 | 64.02 | 65.59 | 60 | 1.11 | 245,310 |\n| 2026 | 19,000,000 | 1,239,180,000 | 65.22 | 66.79 | 60 | 1.35 | 256,500 |\n| Total |  | 44,212,022,105 |  |  |  |  | 3,579,422,109 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| WPT -

The comparison had to be made with the Brent crude price and not the Venezuelan Basket. The Tribunal refers to the actual prices of the oil sold.\n\nThe applicable rates are those pertinent for each layer determined by the Decree applicable to any period of time as fixed by the legislation. The prices applicable for each layer are not repeated here.\n\nThe rate for 2008 has been adjusted from 8.69 to 6.15 because Decree No. 8,807 entered into force by 15 April 2008 only.\n\nIn the year 2011, the rate was 15.21 until April when Decree No. 8,163 entered into force, with the effect that the rate went up to 31.40, resulting in a combined rate for the year of 26.68.\n\nIn the year 2013 the rate was 29.15 until 20 February 2013 when Decree No. 40,114 entered into force and reduced the overall rate to 22.00, resulting in a combined rate per year of 23.10.\n\nFor the calculation of the WPT rate, the observations made in relation to Petrozuata equally apply for Hamaca. For the prices substituted to the Budget Price in the years 2008 to 2010 the sales prices of Hamaca apply.\n\nFor the calculation of the WPT rate, the observations made in relation to Petrozuata equally apply for Corocoro. For the prices substituted to the Budget Price in the years 2008 to 2010 the sales prices of Corocoro apply.\n\nC. The Net Revenue\n------------------\n\n774.\n\nThe Tribunal will now proceed to determine the Net Revenue that results, year by year, from the Gross Revenue (income minus costs), minus Royalties and all other deductions taken from this Revenue, the sum of which will be the basis for the assessment of the payment of the Income Tax.\n\n775.\n\nThe first step consists in computing royalties and extraction tax, together with associated contributions. As this has been mentioned in the general observations above (part A), the royalty and extraction tax of 33.33% is taken from a basis composed of three components: (a) the production volume, (b) the reference price, and (c) the applicable rate. The reference price is either adopted by the Ministry (MENPET) or it is reflected by the maximum price determined by Article 14 of the WPT Law (US$ 70 between 18 April 2011 and 20 February 2013, US$ 80 as from 21 February 2013). When the reference price is below the WPT threshold and no Ministry pricing or other evidence is available, the Tribunal determines such price in using its discretion when considering the Parties' submissions583. In particular, it does not follow the Respondent's experts' flat rate after year 2020 and adopts a slight increase per year of US$ 1, lower than for oil market prices. The basis for this calculation are the volumes of EHCO extracted from the field and used for upgrading to heavy syncrude584. For Corocoro, the volumes of extracted oil from the fields below the sea apply.\n\nThe experts of the Claimants and the Respondent use the same reference price for Corocoro for the years 2008 to 2010. In respect of Petrozuata and Hamaca, where year 2007 is to be added, the differences are very small. As it has followed the Respondent's information on actual sales for these years, it will also take the royalty reference price noted by this Party's experts. Cf. BF-406, Revenues, BF-408; CLEX-086, Revenues.\n\nFor this reason and given the limited information provided by the Claimants, the EHCO by-pass quantities - anyhow small in their volume - are not included in this counting.\n\n776.\n\nThe sales income constitutes the basis for the accounting of various contributions: Science and Technology Contribution of 2%, reduced to 1% with effect as from 2012; Anti-drug contribution of 1%; Social Contribution of 1%; and the Sports Tax of 1% accounted as from 2012. The total is thus 4% for each year.

It may be noted that the dividends were not paid out from the joint company to the participants of the Projects. In fact, the money received from the sales was kept overseas and part of it sent to the Projects in Venezuela to contribute to the costs587.\n\nAbdala/Spiller, Exhibit CLEX-086 (FCF: \"Foregone Dividends\"); Brailovsky/Flores, Exhibit 406 (Contractual FCF: \"Dividends Foregone\").\n\nTR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 13, p. 4005:12-4006:16 (Spiller).\n\n779.\n\nOn the basis of the Tribunal's analysis, the corresponding dividends are the following:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ConocoPhillips' Dividends |\n|  | Petrozuata | Hamaca | Corocoro |\n|  | Net Revenue | CPZ - 50.1% | Net Revenue | CPH - 40% | Net Revenue | CPG - 32.2075% |\n| 2007 \u00bd | 236,475,364 | 118,474,157 | 588,952,233 | 235,580,893 | -- | -- |\n| 2008 | 669,918,645 | 335,629,241 | 888,582,201 | 355,432,880 | 56,488,492 | 18,193,531 |\n| 2009 | 377,842,434 | 189,299,059 | 347,460,700 | 138,984,280 | 99,213,685 | 31,954,307 |\n| 2010 | 595,168,946 | 298,179,642 | 984,423,869 | 393,769,548 | 139,756,273 | 45,012,002 |\n| 2011 | 438,573,150 | 219,725,148 | 710,882,073 | 284,352,829 | 185,804,318 | 59,842,926 |\n| 2012 | 467,422,890 | 234,178,868 | 583,092,654 | 233,237,062 | 172,571,972 | 55,581,118 |\n| 2013 | 557,994,399 | 279,555,194 | 919,847,736 | 367,939,094 | 217,674,381 | 70,107,476 |\n| 2014 | 503,640,260 | 252,323,770 | 738,156,776 | 295,262,710 | 189,784,770 | 61,124,930 |\n| 2015 | - 61,683,780 | - 30,903,574 | - 256,521,188 | - 102,608,475 | - 27,084,718 | - 8,723,311 |\n| 2016 | 178,842,798 | 89,600,242 | 206,064,357 | 82,425,743 | 65,806,519 | 21,194,635 |\n| 2017 | 274,591,139 | 137,570,161 | 350,398,378 | 140,159,351 | 86,675,594 | 27,916,042 |\n| 2018 | 352,329,380 | 176,517,019 | 531,470,334 | 212,588,134 | 97,313,607 | 31,342,280 |\n| 2019 | 352,258,654 | 176,481,586 | 575,054,576 | 230,021,830 | 86,364,361 | 27,815,802 |\n| 2020 | 413,721,183 | 207,274,313 | 621,807,552 | 248,723,021 | 85,354,526 | 27,490,559 |\n| 2021 | 414,453,010 | 207,640,958 | 671,930,010 | 268,772,004 | 79,079,436 | 25,469,509 |\n| 2022 | 454,103,046 | 227,505,626 | 655,398,688 | 262,159,475 | 72,693,117 | 23,412,655 |\n| 2023 | 517,383,083 | 259,208,925 | 657,286,366 | 262,914,546 | 65,518,663 | 21,101,923 |\n| 2024 | 372,523,325 | 186,634,186 | 733,174,044 | 293,269,618 | 56,932,444 | 18,336,517 |\n| 2025 | 309,898,677 | 155,259,237 | 706,463,722 | 282,585,489 | 53,558,590 | 17,249,883 |\n| 2026 | 267,343,567 | 133,939,127 | 714,927,900 | 285,971,160 | 50,453,919 | 16,249,946 |\n| 2027 |  |  | 657,735,578 | 263,094,231 |  |  |\n| 2028 |  |  | 694,689,256 | 277,875,702 |  |  |\n| 2029 |  |  | 749,964,434 | 299,985,774 |  |  |\n| 2030 |  |  | 824,317,112 | 329,726,845 |  |  |\n| 2031 |  |  | 849,518,789 | 339,807,516 |  |  |\n| 2032 |  |  | 849,072,827 | 339,629,131 |  |  |\n| 2033 |  |  | 909,035,645 | 363,614,258 |  |  |\n| 2034 |  |  | 902,194,066 | 360,877,626 |  |  |\n| 2035 |  |  | 875,008,621 | 350,003,448 |  |  |\n| 2036 |  |  | 844,496,116 | 337,798,446 |  |  |\n| Total | 7,712,800,170 | 3,854,092,885 | 20,084,885,425 | 8,033,954,168 | 1,833,960,009 | 590,672,730 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n\nB. The Impact of the Compensation Provisions\n--------------------------------------------\n\n780.\n\nThe payment of compensation in case of Discriminatory Actions based on the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements is related to the payment of dividends. It is therefore appropriate to deal with this matter following the assessment of the dividends the Claimants would have received if the expropriation had not taken place.\n\n781.\n\nRelying on the explanations provided above in Section V/B, the Tribunal, referring firstly to the compensation provision contained in the Petrozuata Association Agreement (Section 9.07), recalls that the operation of the mechanism contained therein requires a Discriminatory Action as defined in Section 1.01 of the Agreement. Such action must be consecutive to a \"Development Decision\" that results in \"unjust discriminatory treatment to the Company or any of its shareholders\". Further, such action has as its characteristic element of discrimination the fact that it is \"not applicable to all enterprises in Venezuela\". For the purpose of triggering the mechanism of the compensation provision, the discriminatory action must produce a \"significant economic damage\" to the shareholders other than the Class A Privileged Shareholders which are those affiliate to or part of PDVSA; a minimum loss of US$ 6.5 million is required.\n\n782.\n\nThis definition has an addition that is here important. Indeed, the treatment as defined above shall not be discriminatory if it \"equally applies to the enterprises (*empresas*) within the oil industry in Venezuela\". This applies, *prima facie*, to the Windfall Profit Legislation that applies to all enterprises in the oil business in Venezuela. The provision has an exception that relates exclusively to income tax; in such a matter, even if generally applicable within the oil industry, the treatment is discriminatory if it is not also generally applicable to most enterprises in Venezuela. This exception does not apply to the WPT that is not designed as an income tax and operates like a royalty.\n\n783.\n\nThe issue to be decided is therefore whether the WPT applies \"equally\", or not, to the enterprises within the oil industry in Venezuela588. The provision using this term does not define it. Such definition cannot be derived from another law, like the WPT Law, which is a legal instrument separate from the Association Agreement. The fact that the WPT Law contains exceptions to its taxing provisions that all obey to the same legal requirements means that equal treatment is provided to those collecting extraordinary profits and potentially applying for an exemption. Nonetheless, the WPT Law provides for unequal treatment between the operators in the oil industry, because for some companies, exemptions are available, whereas for others, they are not. This also means that for the beneficiaries, an exemption implies a tax release, whereas for the others, the tax applies with its full strength. From the point of view of the rules of the Association Agreement, the WPT Law provides for unequal treatment among participants in the oil industry and potential tax payers targeted by the WPT Law. The Association Agreement, when using the expression \"equally applies\" does not distinguish depending whether such circumstance is legal or illegal. The simple fact of unequal treatment, including unequal treatment based on the law, is sufficient to cause the situation to become a discriminatory action under the Agreement. In the present case, there is ample evidence that the Claimants and the ConocoPhillips Company participating in Petrozuata in particular did not obtain any of the various exemptions provided by the WPT Law. Compared to all those who enjoyed one or more of those exemptions, the unequal treatment is established.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is a further exception in case an equally applicable treatment within the oil industry has the effect of causing economic damage to the shareholders of the Company that was not actually suffered by government owned companies within the oil industry (Sec. 1.01/a/3). In the present case, such a situation is not demonstrated, although the Claimants point to a great number of exceptions obtained by PDVSA or affiliate companies. The considerable amount of special contribution payments recorded in the Financial Statements of the Projects does not support such an allegation.\n\n784.\n\nSignificant Economic Damage is established on a (fiscal) yearly basis. As was explained in Section V/B above, compensation is determined by reference to the price of Brent Crude Oil deflated or inflated annually to the year 1994 by the US inflation index. In the present case, one hypothesis only is to be retained, *i.e.* the case where the Brent price reached levels above 25 US$ (inflated from 1994). Based on these requirements, the Brent price to be retained year by year was in a range of about US$ 25 and 50589. In such situations, compensation is awarded if the economic damage suffered is greater than US$ 75 million (in 1994 $ inflated by the US inflation index). The amount to be compensated is then the greater of 25% of the actual economic damage or the amount resulting from a \"sliding scale\" set at 100% for a damage of US$ 18 and then decreasing by 14.29% per one dollar (Sec. 9.07/c). In fact, in light of the actual oil prices experienced since 2007, the compensation to be retained corresponds to 25% of the actual damage resulting from the WPT's application in the years where the tax went above the amount of US$ 75 million (inflated as from 1994 by the US inflation index590). Further, the reduction of the maximum level for the royalties and extraction tax based on Article 14 of the WPT Law has to be taken into account. The impact of the WPT was less significant when the tax applied to exorbitant prices (above US$ 70, later US$ 80) and the upper royalty level was fixed at these amounts. This relates to years 2011 to 2013 when the official royalty reference price was US$ 89,91 (2011), 92.98 (2012) and 87.85 (2013), whereas the actual price based on Article 14 of the WPT Law was US$ 75.89 (2011), 70 (2012) and 78.60 (2013)591.\n\nLeitzinger/Finizza, Expert Report dated 24 July 2009, Appendix 6.\n\nBased on the information provided by the Respondent's experts Leitzinger and Finizza, the respective amounts moved upwards from US$ 75 million to US$ 135 million in 2023 (Expert Report dated 24 July 2009, Appendix 6). Accordingly, the threshold was reached in the years 2008 and 2010 to 2014, but no longer as from year 2015.\n\nCf. B/F Appendix 408. In 2014, both prices were at the same level of US$ 78.40.\n\n785.\n\nThe Petrozuata compensation provision contained a number of procedural requirements that can be considered as settled in a but-for scenario, such as the absence of any other legal or administrative action providing a remedy from the application of a discriminatory action (Sec. 9.07/d). In particular, the compensation provision does not address any potential legal action directed against state authorities for the purpose of denying any legal obligation allegedly based on the WPT Law. The right to compensation relates to damages suffered during the fiscal year previous to the year in which the written notice relating to such damage has been sent to the Class A Privileged Shareholder (Sec. 9.07/e). This means that the compensation is paid the year after following the discriminatory action has been implemented. It may be assumed that sufficient cash was available and that therefore the hypothesis of deferred payments has not to be taken into account (Sec. 9.07/a). The figures of the resulting compensation are as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ConocoPhillips' Compensation (Petrozuata) |\n|  | WPT US$ | Reduction to Royalty reference price (Art. 14 WPT) | Brent Price higher than $25.00, damage higher than $75MM (both inflated): compensation in US$ the following year |\n| 2007 \u00bd | -- |  | -- |\n| 2008 | 219,560,559 |  | 0 |\n| 2009 |  |  | 48,038,760 |\n| 2010 | 68,780 |  | 0 |\n| 2011 | 965,816,000 | - 195,256,640 | 0 |\n| 2012 | 1,165,640,000 | - 320,042,624 | 45,014,391 |\n| 2013 | 836,220,000 | - 128,824,817 | 0 |\n| 2014 | 390,960,000 |  | 74,484,514 |\n| 2015 | 0 |  | 101,203,324 |\n| 2016 | 0 |  | 0 |\n| 2017 | 0 |  | 0 |\n| 2018 | 0 |  | 0 |\n| 2019 | 0 |  | 0 |\n| 2020 | 0 |  | 0 |\n| 2021 | 54,300 |  | 0 |\n| 2022 | 141,180 |  | 0 |\n| 2023 | 228,060 |  | 0 |\n| 2024 | 231,420 |  | 0 |\n| 2025 | 245,310 |  | 0 |\n| 2026 | 256,500 |  | 0 |\n| Total | 3,579,422,109 | - 644,124,081 | 286,740,989 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n\n786.\n\nThe Hamaca compensation system was both more complicated and less protective in respect of the actual WPT Law. The key point here is that the obligation of Corpoven Sub to compensate the affected party for any material adverse effect (corresponding to a reduction of more than 5% of its cash flow) of a Discriminatory Action suffered in a fiscal year is no longer effective when the price of Brent Crude Oil is equal or greater than US$ 27.00 (not inflated) as from the end of the initial period in December 2007 (Sec. 14.2/b, d and g). In the relevant period as from 2008 when the WPT Law entered into force, the Brent Crude price was always above this threshold. Therefore, there is no dispute that no compensation results from the Hamaca Association Agreement in respect of the windfall tax592.\n\nCf.

Interest**\n----------------\n\n787.\n\nInterest is a component of reparation based on amounts of money. It serves to establish the value of reparation determined at a particular date as it moves forward into the future as from that date. In respect of the historical period from the date of the expropriation in June 2007 up to the end of year 2018, interest can be determined based on real terms, as the Tribunal has already established the net revenue that the Claimants have lost. As from the date of this Award, interest is based on an estimation of the future progress in value of the amounts awarded until effective payment.\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n788.\n\nThe Claimants submit that compensation for delayed payment is an essential part of full reparation under international law. To the extent that payment is delayed, the claimant loses the opportunity to use the funds for productive ends. The Claimants are entitled to two categories of reparation for delayed payment in this case: (a) compensation for the loss of use of the historical cash flows that they would have received from the date of expropriation up to the date of the Tribunal's final Award; and (b) post-award interest on the total amount of damages awarded, running until the date of full and final payment. The proper measure of compensation in both instances is the same: the Claimants' opportunity cost, as reflected in the cost of equity of the expropriated Projects.\n\n789.\n\nRelying on the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case593, the Claimants contend that the rate at which lost cash flows should be updated to present value or increased by interest must ensure that they are restored to the same position it would have enjoyed had the expropriation not occurred. In both scenarios, the loss to the claimant is the opportunity cost of having been deprived of the funds in question. The Claimants were deprived of the periodic dividends generated by the Projects, and were instead, de facto, forced to reinvest those funds into the Projects. The minimum rate is therefore the Projects' cost of equity. A claimant may rightly select interest at its opportunity cost of capital. This is particularly true for a business operating under an on-going concern. The expropriation meant that the periodic dividends that would have been generated by the Projects and distributed to the Claimants from the date of expropriation onwards were not in fact distributed. Instead, these dividends were effectively retained - forcibly reinvested - in the Projects. The Claimants should therefore be compensated for the risks of the compelled investment.\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice, *The Factory At Chorz\u00f3w (Claim for Indemnity) (The Merits), Germany v. Poland*, Judgment No. 13, 13 September 1928, 1928 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 17 (CL-84).\n\n790.\n\nThe Claimants explain that this approach has been endorsed by the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina*594. The tribunal ultimately ordered pre-award interest based primarily on the claimant's cost of capital, noting that the proper rate should be a reasonable proxy for the return claimants could otherwise have earned. Similarly, the tribunal in *France Telecom v. Lebanon* awarded prejudgment interest at 10%, noting that this rate reflected the reasonable profitability of the capital of which the claimant was deprived595.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. & Vivendi Universal S.A. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award of 20 August 2007 (CL-42).\n\n*France Telecom Mobile International, S.A. v. Lebanese Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award dated 31 January 2005 (CL-307).\n\n791.\n\nIn *Alpha Projektholding v. Ukraine,* the tribunal updated past-due sums based on the \"riskfree rate plus the market risk premium\", for a total interest rate of 9.11%, reasoning that \"this rate better reflects the opportunity cost associated with Claimant's losses, adjusted for the risks of investing in Ukraine\"596. Thus, the tribunal recognized that a risk-free rate, alone, would under compensate the claimant. The tribunal in *ConocoPhillips v. PDVSA* awarded compound pre- and postaward interest at a rate corresponding to the Projects' then existing cost of equity, determined using the ICAPM method (10.55%)597.\n\n*Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award dated 8 November 2010, para. 514 (CL-253).\n\n*Phillips B.V. v. Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited & ConocoPhillips Petrozuata Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.* (ICC 16849/JRF), Award dated 17 September 2012 (CL-255).\n\n792.\n\nThe principle of opportunity cost was also recently applied in determining the applicable interest rate in *SAUR v. Argentina*598. Rejecting a simple risk-free interest rate as unreasonably low, the tribunal instead adopted the agreed rate of return of the project at issue. It identified this rate as the Weighted Average of Capital (WACC), which the tribunal also applied to the discount rate -describing this as the rate at which the claimant investor was prepared to continue its long-term investment.\n\n*SAUR International S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/4, Award dated 22 May 2014 (CL-341).\n\n793.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Claimants' historical lost cash flows should be brought to present value by applying the Projects' cost of equity as the update factor. The Claimants' experts have calculated the Projects' historical cost of equity at 13.0%. They apply this update factor for their 2016 (and 2007) valuations599.\n\nAbdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 103, table 5.\n\n794.\n\nThe Respondent objects to this approach and submits that it cannot be known what the Claimants would have willingly chosen to do with dividends from the Projects in a but-for world. Their experts go so far as to argue that the update factor should be the risk-free rate. In fact, the Claimants remained investors in the Projects, and remained exposed to the Projects' risks. The dividends that would have accrued to the Claimants were by compulsion reinvested into the Project.\n\n795.\n\nThe Respondent demands that the Tribunal apply an extremely low update factor of 1.30%. It essentially assumes that the Claimants would have put their money in a savings account. This update factor, as proposed by the Respondent's experts, is also unjustifiable in light of the 27.7% and 19.8% discount rate they propose for the 2016 and 2007 valuations. According to the experts, the risk associated with the cash flows generated by the Projects is 1.30% for historical cash flows, but 27.7% (or 19.8%) for future cash flows600. The asymmetry in the discount and interest rates proposed by the experts has the effect of artificially reducing the Claimants' recovery for both historical and future cash flows. This result is incompatible with the principle of full reparation.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 662, table 43.\n\n796.\n\nThe Claimants also note that a failure properly to compensate them for their opportunity cost would not only undermine the principle of full reparation, but would also lead to the unjust enrichment of the Respondent. By not paying compensation to the Claimants for the expropriation, Venezuela has had free access to the funds that it wrongfully appropriated. It was receiving the earning capacity of the borrowed money without compensation to the Claimants. The reasonable cost that Venezuela would have incurred in borrowing the amount in question is the rate at which investors lend to Venezuela, *i.e.* the yield on its sovereign debt. At present, that rate is close to 24%. The average rate since the date of expropriation has been approximately 15%. This is higher than what the Claimants seek.\n\n797.\n\nMoving to post-award interest, the Claimants submit that the considerations are the same. The opportunity cost to the Claimants is the same: the Projects' cost of equity. The only difference is that the present-day cost of equity figure should be used, which is 15.2%.\n\n798.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that both the update factor and post-award interest should be granted on a compound basis. The Respondent claims that simple interest is called for by both Venezuelan law and international authorities. This is wrong on both counts. Principles of Venezuelan law play no role in an analysis based on customary international law. The prevailing trend among investor-State arbitration tribunals is to award compound pre-award interest, as an element of full reparation for violations of international law. The *Occidental* tribunal concluded that the recent practice in favor of compounding interests accords with the *Chorz\u00f3w* principle601. It is the norm in recent expropriation cases under ICSID. Accordingly, historical lost cash flows should be updated to present value at a rate of 13.0%, and post-award interest should accrue at a rate of 15.2%. Both should be subject to reasonable compounding, under an annual periodicity, because the cost of equity is calculated on the basis of expected annual returns. The Tribunal would also be justified in applying a rate of 15%, Venezuela's average borrowing rate since the expropriations.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Award dated October 5, 2012 (CL-256).\n\n*2. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n799.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it would be appropriate to deny any pre-award interest in this case, for two reasons. First, if the Claimants had accepted the generous offers made to them in 2007, instead of insisting on compensation \"on top of the fair market value of the assets\", this Arbitration would never have been necessary. Second, if the Claimants had not misled this Tribunal with their misrepresentations on the compensation negotiations, this case in all likelihood would have ended long ago. If any interest is to be awarded, it should be calculated as provided below, depending upon whether the valuation made is with or without taking into account the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects.\n\n800.\n\nIf the first alternative applies, the Respondent notes that the Parties agree that pre-award interest (if any) for the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects in both the *ex ante* and *ex post* scenarios applying the compensation provisions should be calculated using the interest rates specified in these provisions. For Petrozuata, the interest rate is the LIBOR for 12-month deposits, in accordance with Sections 1.01 and 9.07(d) of the Petrozuata Association Agreement. For Hamaca, the interest rate is the 3-month LIBOR, as specified in Section 14.3(d) of the Association Agreement.\n\n801.\n\nThere are only two remaining differences between the Parties with respect to the calculations of pre-award interest. First, the Claimants apply compound interest, whereas the Respondent uses simple interest. Simple interest is called for by both international authorities and Venezuelan law. Although the Claimants have argued that compound interest is the norm in international arbitration, this is contradicted by a long line of authorities, including the *Yukos* Awards, where the tribunal not only applied simple interest to the pre-award period but also granted a 180-day grace period for payment of the award during which no post-award interest applied602. With respect to Venezuelan law, which governs the Association Agreements, compounding is allowed in only two situations contemplated in Article 530 of the Venezuelan Commercial Code (R-166), neither one being applicable in this case. Therefore, only simple interest can be awarded. The second difference is due to an arithmetical error on the part of Claimants in their *ex ante* valuation, when they calculated interest individually for each of the Hamaca and Petrozuata Projects, and then added those numbers. The error results in an amount of US$ 135 million.\n\n*Hulley Enterprises Limited (Cyprus) v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL (ECT), PCA Case No. AA 226, Final Award dated July 18, 2014 (R-424); *Veteran Petroleum Limited (Cyprus) v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL (ECT), PCA Case No. AA 228, Final Award dated 18 July 2014 (R-426).\n\n802.\n\nIn the scenario where the valuation is disregarding the compensation provisions, the Respondent notes that a huge gap remains between the Parties. The Claimants propose a figure of 13%, using a cost of equity analysis that is wholly inappropriate to the determination of pre-award interest. The Dutch Treaty establishes that compensation for expropriation should \"include interest at a normal commercial rate\" (Article 6c). The Claimants argue that the Treaty standard does not apply \"where a respondent has expropriated in violation of the Treaty's requirements, as Venezuela has done here\". There is now no doubt that the Tribunal's decision on bad faith is unsustainable; this should dispose of the Claimants' attempt to avoid the Treaty standard.\n\n803.\n\nIt is well established that pre-award interest should be based on a short-term, risk-free rate, reflecting the borrowing costs that the Claimants would normally expect to incur on a commercial basis in a \"but-for\" world. If the Claimants had planned investments to be financed with the dividends from the Project, they could still have made them with short-term borrowing. This approach is supported by a wealth of authority. On this basis, the Respondent's experts concluded that the appropriate rate should be the three-month US Treasury rate plus 1%. The same approach should be followed in respect of post-award interest.\n\n804.\n\nThe Respondent objects that the Claimants' experts' interest rate of 13% is based on the flawed premises that the Claimants were \"forced\" to reinvest historical cash flows in the Projects and they should therefore be compensated for the risks of that compelled investment. That approach would in effect compensate the Claimants for risks that they did not bear rather than place them back in the position they would have occupied in a \"but-for\" world. The flaws in Claimants' \"cost of equity\" approach have been repeatedly exposed in commentary and arbitral decisions.\n\n805.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to the decision in *Tza Yap Shum*603, where experts from the same consulting firm than Claimants' experts in this case argued that it was not appropriate to use the claimant's cost of equity to calculate pre-award interest. The use of financing costs is not appropriate when the risk premium included in those costs disappears at the moment the company is expropriated. The *Tza Yap Shum* tribunal rejected the idea that interest should correspond to the cost of equity of the investment and awarded interest at a rate tied to US Treasury bonds.\n\n*Mr. Tza Yap Shum v. The Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Award dated July 7, 2011 (R-566).\n\n806.\n\nThe Respondent also replies to the Claimants' argument that a \"comparable rate\" should be used for interest and discount rate. In its view, the opposing Party ignores the fact that the discount rate applies to future cash flows, which are affected by all relevant risks, while the interest rate applies to historical cash flows, which are not affected by those risks. The recent *Vestey* award rejected claimant's approach, finding that it would reward them for risks that they had not born604. The tribunal also rejected the claimant's alternative that the interest rate should be the cost of capital of the investment, finding that this would compensate it for risks that it did not assume after the expropriation. The *Vestey* tribunal ultimately found that the appropriate interest rate was a risk-free rate applicable to US currency debt, *i.e.* the six-month US Treasury bond rate, noting that this conclusion was supported by the practice of international tribunals.\n\n*Vestey Group Limited v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award dated April 15, 2016 (BF-502).\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\n807.\n\nIn light of the explanations provided above and the detailed analysis of the negotiations between the Parties and of the representations made in this respect, the Tribunal can refer to its Interim Decision dated 17 January 2017, thus replying to the Respondent's argument that this Arbitration may not have been necessary.\n\n808.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the question to be answered here is not simply one about \"interest\". Interest represents generally a proportion of an amount lent, deposited, or borrowed. Such proportion is usually expressed through a percentage representing interest, or a rate. Interest is a profit derived from an amount of money. However, profits other than interest can result from such amounts. This is the case when capital is invested for the purpose of production of goods and services that have values that may be expressed in terms of money, but that are not interest.\n\n809.\n\nIn the instant case, the principal capital from which an eventual profit is to be determined are the dividends the Claimants were entitled to receive in a but-for scenario on a yearly basis and for each of its respective Projects. The Claimants argue that they were \"forced\" to leave these dividends in the Project. While the term \"forced\" may not be appropriate, the fact is that the amounts corresponding to each of the Claimants' share of dividends remained in the Projects. They were not paid to these Parties and they were not consigned in a separate account or used for any other special purpose distinct from the Projects' operation. As a simple matter of fact and contrary to the Respondent's assumption, the dividends could not have been used by the Claimants for the purpose of financing other investments. The profit resulting from the dividends, as they remained in the Projects, cannot be compared to the costs for short-term borrowing of money on the market.\n\n810.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined that the profit accruing to the Claimants during the historical period from the Projects' operation in the hypothesis the Association Agreements would have continued to apply as if no expropriation had taken place. That profit was retained by the Respondent from the dividends it withheld, which would have accrued if the but-for operation of the Projects is considered together with the assumption that these dividends were not released and remained in the Projects' accounts. The situation is therefore completely different from the Respondent's hypothesis where the Claimants would have borrowed money on a short-term basis at a rate of 1.5%. Even if that would have been done, the fact remains that the Projects' holder retained the amounts reserved for the payment of dividends, including its inherent potential of profit resulting from the Projects' operation605.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the awards referred to by the Respondent for its approach retain the date of expropriation as valuation date. Cf. *Mr.* *Tza Yap Shum v. The Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Award, dated July 7, 2011, paras. 286-292; *Vestey Group Limited v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award dated April 15, 2016, paras. 436-449 (BF-502).\n\n811.\n\nAs a matter of fact, these dividends remained part of the Projects' resources and were undoubtedly used in support of the Projects' operation. They represented therefore an additional resource for the Projects, corresponding - in a but-for scenario - to an increase of the Claimants' financial support and investment. Such an increase served the financing of the Projects. Its value must be determined, however, not on this basis alone. It must include the profit generated by the Projects in proportion to the investment made.\n\n812.\n\nThe Claimants' experts have used as reference the cost of equity required from an investor as a minimum rate at which it could be convinced to postpone the collection of the dividends606. The loss suffered by the Claimants in this respect resulted in an increase of the investment in the Projects through the retention of dividends not paid out. Such reference is project-related and not related to the equity market.\n\nCf. Abdula/Spiller, March 2016 Update, 18 March 2016, para. 65.\n\n813.\n\nThe Claimants' experts observed that, in principle, the Claimants would have voluntarily reinvested additional monies in the Project only if they expected to receive back at least the Project's cost of equity. The cost of equity of the Projects is the minimum rate at which such investors would have voluntarily reinvested additional monies in the Projects607.\n\nPreliminary Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 12 September 2008, para. 84.\n\n814.\n\nWhile the Claimants' experts' principle is clearly set out, the resulting figures are difficult to understand. The Consolidated Report refers in a footnote to other reports where the respective rate was determined as 10.6% (2007), 10.8% (2008), 11.7% (2009), 11.8% (2010), 14.5% (2015) and 15.2% (2016), and the appropriate rate for the full historical period as 13%608. The experts further refer to their April 2016 Report, where these numbers are not mentioned or explained, further reference being added to two earlier reports609; the main focus is the criticism of the Respondent's experts' suggestion to retain a risk-free rate of about 1.5%. The experts' October 2014 Report simply repeats that the rate for historical cost of equity was 11.7%, further pointing to the discrepancy in the Respondent's experts' position when they adopt an actualization rate of 1.4% for past cash flow, whereas they retain 23.3% for the discount rate applied to future cash flow610. The May 2014 Report also mentions the 11.7% rate611. The matter has then to be traced back to the LECG Second Report where it is stated in a footnote that the experts determined that the costs of equity of the Projects are 11.87% for Petrozuata, 11.88% for Hamaca and 11.70% for Corocoro as of September 30, 2009612.\n\nConsolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, footnote 35, para. 103. General explanations (not related to numbers) are given under paras. 27, 96-99. In another report, the percentages were 14.5% for May 2014, 15.4% for October 2014, and 16.7% for March 2016, also concluding at an average rate of 13%; March 2016 Update, 18 March 2016, footnote 30.\n\nRebuttal Report, 21 April 2016, paras. 63-67\n\nCf. Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, Supplemental Report, 13 October 2014, paras. 14, 78-80, 109-111, 248.\n\n*Ibidem*, footnote 26, para. 76.\n\nSecond Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 2 November 2009, Appendix A, footnote 7. The percentages provided are not explained, neither as such nor in comparison to the cost ratings for the discount rate - of about 1% to 2% lower -, which seems to be related to the impact of the cost of debt rate. Further reference is provided in LECG-237, where numbers are supported by further numbers but not explained as to their pertinence.\n\n815.\n\nOn the other hand, retaining low rates for interest, like the 1.4% rate suggested by the Respondent, would make it substantially attractive for the Project holder to borrow money from the investor at such rate through the retention of dividends not released, instead of paying a significantly higher market rate for borrowing money (as the rates around 8% that were paid to the Petrozuata's bond holders, or the 1.5% rate suggested by the Respondent in case of a short-term borrowing). Even if it were considered that the Claimants do no longer bear the risks of the Project, they were entitled to receive the profit resulting from their investment at a value taking into consideration the inherent risk factors of their investment. If it is assumed that the dividends that were not distributed were used to cover costs, like CAPEX or OPEX, the reduction in financing such costs would also represent a value corresponding to the reduction of the profit to be received by the shareholders which does not correspond to the rate they would have to pay for borrowing shortterm money on the financial market. In any event, it seems highly unrealistic to assume, as the Respondent's experts seem to do, that an investor would find money to borrow on the exclusive basis of risk-free rate at the level between 1% and 2%, when the Project includes an industry risk and a (specific) country risk component that raises the cost for equity far above 10%, as accepted by these experts in their own submission in respect of the value of dividends in case of a discount of future profits.\n\n816.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Respondent's approach to determine interest on dividends is not acceptable, the same way as it is not acceptable that the host State retains earnings from the sale of crude oil while paying the expropriated investor a minimal price having no relation to market prices. It appears unreasonable that the Respondent's Projects' holders would retain dividends over years and make profit resulting from it at the rate inherent in the Projects' operational configuration, while the Claimants would have to be content with the most minimal rate available on the money market. Such rate would not cover the risk inherent when the Claimants would use the borrowed money for the purpose of an investment into the Projects.\n\n817.\n\nThe rate of profit resulting from the dividends, or, as it may be simply said, the interest resulting from such principal capital has the function that it should reflect the profit the investor can expect to receive from the Project in light of all of its operational circumstances. Such interest should not be below this level, because this would have the effect of providing the holder of the Project with an undue advantage because it would retain money at a lower cost than what it would have to pay when borrowing money from an investor613. On the other hand, the Claimants' claim for recovery based on the profit resulting from the dividends not released should not be higher than this level, unless there would be evidence for serious expectations that the resulting benefit from the equity withhold in the Project would be significantly higher. It would be contradictory, as this results from the Respondent's and their experts' arguments, to simply say that the Claimants having left the Projects in June 2007 have no longer been in a position to support any risk in the Projects and that, therefore, their indemnification must be reduced to a risk-free level on the money market. Such reasoning ignores that in a but-for scenario where no expropriation had taken place, the Claimants would have been entitled to retain profits arising from the Projects by taking account of all risks underlying the determination of such profits. This is what has been \"taken away\", not the costs for borrowing risk-free money.\n\nCf. *Phillips B.V. v. Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited & ConocoPhillips Petrozuata Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.*, ICC 16849/JRF), Award dated 17 September 2012, para. 295 (CL-255).\n\n818.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate rate must be set at a level at which the investor expects to retain a profit, by keeping the amount corresponding to the dividends within the Projects. Such rate should represent the sum of risks inherent in the Project and expressed in the form of a proportion of profit, or interest. It represents the level at which the investor, all factors considered, accepts to assume the investment in considering the assessment of risks related to the Projects' operation.\n\n819.\n\nThe Claimants and their experts use the term \"update factor\" as an equivalent to interest that has the purpose of compensating the damaged party for the time delay in collecting the funds of which it was deprived between the date of deprivation and the date of the Award. In other words, the Claimants are to be restored to the position they would have had if the collection of dividends had not been interrupted through the expropriation and they would have decided willingly to retain those dividends within the Project. In such a case, the Claimants' bargain represents the return at the minimum level at which they would have expected to make a profit. The update factor is equal to the Claimants' cost of equity for financing the investment in the Projects. It reflects the increase in value actualized to the date of valuation.\n\n820.\n\nThe Tribunal assumes in a first step that the cost of equity determined by the Claimants' experts is correct. This interest has been initially set at 11.7%, but in the course of the economic development came up to 15%, resulting in an average of 13%. The Respondent must fail in its position that the value of the dividends withheld in the Projects should be brought forward at a level of around 1.5% as if these amounts had been set aside in a bank account or borrowed from a bank. The Respondent did not comment further on the percentages indicated by the Claimants, except through its basic rejection of the approach adopted by the Claimants' experts. Nevertheless, the Claimants' experts' information is incomplete and of limited evidentiary support. First, neither the initial figure of 11.7% nor the later percentages were supplied with explanation or further documentary evidence. Second, the information for several years is missing, before the rate climbs over 14% in 2014 and 15% in 2015, a difference that would normally call for reasons to be given. The average of 13% submitted by the Claimants thus represents a number having uncertain foundation, in particular in light of the important consequences that are drawn therefrom in respect of the updating614.\n\nAt the 2017 March Hearing, the average of 13% was confirmed and further explained as being obtained by reference to the average stock market return of the largest five companies of a sample, thus obtaining 11%; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3342:5/6, 3343:7-21 (Spiller).\n\n821.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal notes that the rate for historical cost of equity suggested by the Claimants' experts is based on the assessment on profits derived from the Composite Economic Model (CEM), including in particular the figures on production and costs that were retained at that time, by the end of 2006 and still applicable before the expropriation. The update factor may have been set at 13% at that time, but such percentage must be adjusted in light of the conclusions the Tribunal reached in this Award in respect of production and costs. The Tribunal found different quantities and amounts in this regard, after a detailed analysis of production and costs of each of the three Projects. This examination was based on all of the elements of evidence on the Tribunal's record, based on a prudent and realistic assessment. Compared to the Model the Parties use as prepared towards the end of 2006 and still reliable in June 2007, the Tribunal's assessment is different. The said Model was based on business estimations that were certainly prepared seriously, with a high degree of professionalism, but they may also have received an input of optimism that may have designed the future of the Projects better than what it finally became. It may be sufficient to note here the cliff on productivity as of the end of year 2023 that affected the Petrozuata Project that was not recorded in the early Model of 2006, and the difficulties the Hamaca upgrader was facing. The Tribunal has thus adopted values in respect of both production and costs significantly different. The effect of these differences is that the overall profitability of the Projects appears reduced in comparison to the initial estimation in the CEM. The Tribunal measures the overall impact of such reduction in proportion of profit at about 25%, comparing the figures retained in the CEM to those retained in this Award. This leads to a reduction of the project related update factor from 13% to 9.75%.\n\n822.\n\nCost of equity represents amounts re-invested in the Project. However, the amounts reinvested do not have the effect of increasing dividends. They contribute to the financing of the projects, in one way or another; when this is accomplished, they do not further improve the financing or increase the investment. In other words, the year-by-year value increase generated from the dividends remaining in the Projects does not produce an effect comparable to the compounding of interest.\n\n823.\n\nOnce the dividends and their update value have been determined for the historical period between the date of the expropriation and the date of end 2018 retained by the Award, the question may be raised and has to be answered whether the resulting amounts should be discounted back to 26 June 2007, the date of the expropriation, when the right for compensation originated from Article 6c of the BIT. At that point in time, the right for compensation could not have been assessed otherwise than through a discount of the estimated future profits resulting in favor of the Claimants had they remained on the Projects. Some of the decisions quoted by the Claimants in support of the allocation of pre-award interest also deal with the allocation by reference to the date of the injury. They have accepted that the resulting amount be discounted to the time of the expropriation or any other violation of a BIT relevant in the particular case615. The *Alpha* Tribunal awarded preaward interest, as the Claimants noted correctly, but the Tribunal also ruled that the future revenue streams were to be discounted to the day of the expropriation616. In the case of *Telecom*, the Claimants note that a pre-judgment interest of 10% was awarded; this had been done, however, in combination with a discount back to the date of the breach of the BIT617.\n\nThe relevance of the *Vivendi* award seems doubtful in this regard in light the fact that the claim for lost profit was rejected for lack of evidence. Cf. *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. & Vivendi Universal S.A. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award of 20 August 2007, para. 8.3.11 (CL-42). The Tribunal noted that the claim for anticipated future cash flow was discounted (para. 8.1.2).\n\n*Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award of 8 November 2010, paras. 481-483, 491, 493, 497 (CL-253).\n\n*France Telecom Mobile International, S.A. v. Lebanese Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award dated 31 January 2005, paras. 202, 209 (CL-307).\n\n824.\n\nHowever, when the value of future revenue is to be determined, or *ex post,* any discount is justified only in a situation only where payment of compensation is to be assessed as per the day of such payment, together with an appropriate commercial interest. Such discount cannot operate in relation to amounts of money that are assessed on the basis of actual facts in the historical period, resulting in profits that are not owned in the future but were due to the Claimants had they remained in the Projects. In the present case, no compensation was provided by the Respondent as from the day when it was owned to the Claimants based on Article 6c of the BIT. Therefore, the Claimants' claims are to be evaluated at their value at the time of this Award, including profits accruing in a but-for scenario up to that date. Any discount back to 2007 would result in an enrichment of the Respondent who would retain the difference between (i) the profits it would have obtained had it operated the Projects under the circumstances pertinent in case no expropriation had taken place and (ii) the discounted amount that would be left for the Claimants, together with interest determined at a commercial rate.\n\n825.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted that the argument could be made - in light of the duration of this proceeding - that in case the Claimants would recover the full benefit accruing during the historical period (until the time the Award is rendered), and assuming that the earnings allocated for the postaward period are discounted, the Claimants would recover a benefit simply through the passage of time during which the arbitral proceedings are moving forward. The profit accruing from the Projects in a but-for scenario that the Claimants' claim to be applicable appears to be higher than the recovery of the discounted post-award dividends. It would seem, so the argument, that such ongoing accrual of benefit is not based on any causation link to the expropriation. The Tribunal notes, however, that the argument is misleading: the difference between pre- and post-award allocation of moneys is not based on a variation in the valuation of the Claimants' benefit (before and after the time of the award). It is based simply on the fact that at the date of the Award, the Claimants receive their future profits, determined on the same basis than for the historical period, together with a discount that accounts for the fact that they receive - or should receive - the future profits awarded by the Tribunal at the time of the Award and not in later years when they would be due had the Claimants remained in the Projects.\n\n826.\n\nFinally, with regard to post-award interest, the main question that arises is whether there are grounds for diverging from the method and rates applied to pre-award interest.\n\n827.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the damage incurred by the passing of time is largely the same after the issuance of the Award as before. However, after the issuance of the Award, the compensation of the Claimants' losses is no longer based on the Projects nor does it further result from their investment. The purpose of post-award interest is to compensate the loss suffered by the Claimants due to the fact that the discounted value of future dividends has not been paid and the corresponding amount was not available to the Claimants for their usual business, separate from the Projects. Therefore, there is no necessity based on logic or economics that would require the updating interest of the historical profits to be the same as the interest bringing the value of the Award forward until effective payment. This does not mean, as the Respondent submits, that the increase of the value of the outstanding amounts should be measured through interest factors used for saving money on bank accounts. The Claimants' activity consists of operating business opportunities in the oil industry. Therefore, the interest should reach a level corresponding to the financing of such opportunities. As will be explained below when concluding about the appropriate discount rate, the pertinent industry risk premium is 5.5%. The same percentage shall serve as post-award interest rate. If the interest was not set at this level, the Respondent would have an incentive not to pay the Award. This would result in an unjust enrichment that must be avoided.\n\n828.\n\nIn the instant case, post-award interest represents compensation for the loss of the money awarded. Such interest will not serve to increase the amounts of dividends to which the Claimants are entitled in a but-for scenario. Post-award interest serves to compensate the Claimants for the lack of revenue represented by the amounts awarded and the profit that the Claimants would most probably derive from it in the usual course of its business. This business is certainly not to have the money paid by the Respondent placed in a saving account with minimal interest. It must be assumed that the interest awarded and paid will become part of the Claimants' business and accumulate the profit derived from it. In order to comply with this economic component of the post-award interest accruing on the basis of this Award, such interest must be awarded on an annually compounded basis.\n\n829.\n\nOne exception must be added. The compensation awarded on the account of ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (CPZ) includes an amount of US$ 286,740,989 based on the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata Association Agreement. This amount follows the allocation of interest contained in these provisions, *i.e.* post-award simple interest to run until the date of full and final payment at 12-month LIBOR (Sec. 9.07(d), Sec. 1.01) or any other comparable rate in case LIBOR should be discontinued in the future.\n\n**XII. Discount Rate**\n----------------------\n\n830.\n\nThe presentations of the Parties' experts are comparable in the sense that the discount rate has three components: (1) a risk-free rate, (2) an industry rate reflecting the risks of an equity investment in oil production, and (3) a country risk.\n\n831.\n\nWhile their positions are very close on the two first elements, they are deeply divided in respect of the so called \"country risk\". The division of opinion is such that the comparison of the numerous and sometimes confusing arguments is difficult to follow, and in large part not useful due to the fact that assertions are made and theories presented without taking care of the need to remain connected to the specificities of the instant case and particularly, to the economics of the Projects at issue. The Tribunal will take those arguments that are relevant to the resolution of the instant case and will avoid the use of expressions used by the experts that make the matter confusing or that are presented by the experts in a way that is difficult to translate in the legal analysis that is required for the drafting of an award that provides the reasons that guided the members of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n832.\n\nThe confusion and uncertainty in the Parties' presentations on the issue of the discount rate is also due to the fact that they - together with their experts - spend more time and effort criticizing the opinions expressed by the opposing party than to explain their own position. Criticism, by itself, does not result in precise figures and conclusions, and is therefore of limited use for the Tribunal.\n\n*1. The Claimants' Position*\n----------------------------\n\n833.\n\nThe Claimants submit that a discount rate is used to convert the expected future cash flows (future production multiplied by prices, minus costs and net of applicable taxes) back to present value as of the date of valuation. The discount rate reflects the risk that the future cash flows will not materialize as projected, and also accounts for the time value of money. All else being equal, a higher discount rate leads to a lower present value of future cash flows. Selection of an appropriate discount rate is essential to achieving full reparation. The Claimants say that their discount rate is reasonable, conservative and appropriate.\n\n834.\n\nConsistent with standard valuation practice, the Claimants' experts Abdala and Spiller have used the International Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPAM) \"building blocks\" approach. (i) Starting with a risk-free rate (1.9%), they (ii) added a factor reflecting the risks associated with an equity investment in the upstream crude oil industry in a developed economy like the United States (5.5%), which together with the risk-free rate yielded a discount rate for a U.S. upstream oil and gas project; and (iii) then applied a country risk premium to reflect the country-specific risks to which the Projects would have been exposed but-for their unlawful expropriation (4.2%). This shows a discount rate of 11.6%.\n\n835.\n\nThe Claimants explain that their experts base their country risk premium on the credit rating of the debt issued by the Petrozuata Project before the possibility of expropriation began to be discussed publicly. This rating at the time reflected the market's perception of the risk of an investment in the Petrozuata Project. The difference between that rating and the rating of a comparable investment in the U.S. yields the incremental country risk applicable to the Projects. The experts thus derive an updated discount rate of 11.6% for the 2016 valuation (and 8.9% for a 2007 valuation). Venezuela, by contrast, comes up with an indefensibly high discount rate of 27.7% for the 2016 valuation (and 19.8% for a 2007 valuation).\n\n836.\n\nThe Claimants note that their discount rates are: (a) consistent with the rates used by the Project participants and their affiliates throughout their relationship; (b) consistent with the discount rates used by investment bank analysts and global energy consultants; and (c) higher than the discount rate used by ConocoPhillips to value developed projects.\n\n837.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that their discount rates are consistent with the Projects' own practices. A report prepared by the Petrozuata Project in January 2000 shows PDVSA using a \"real discount rate\" of 8.53% (C-323). Similarly, a Financing Memorandum prepared by the Hamaca Project in August 2000 applied a 10% discount rate (C-101), also used for Petrozuata (C-75), as this also results from the Offering Circular of 2013 (C-610). A document produced after the August 2016 hearing proposed a discount range of 8% to 12% (C-696). These discount rates are virtually the same rates that the Claimants' experts have calculated.\n\n838.\n\nProceeding with some comparisons, the Claimants observe that 8% to 12% discount rates are not outliers. The annual Consolidated Financial Statements for PDVSA and its subsidiaries have used discount rates of 10% to bring expected cash flows from PDVSA's proven oil and gas reserves to present value every year between 2008 and 2014 (C-593, C-616). The inconsistency is obvious. Venezuela discounts future cash flows at 10% when reporting to the global capital markets, but discounts at 27.7% when calculating the Claimants' damages.\n\n839.\n\nIn 2014 PDVSA endorsed the use of an 8% discount rate in valuing a natural gas project between PDVSA and foreign investors Eni and Repsol (C-619, C-617). In May 2010, Venezuela entered into a treaty with China concerning the development of the Jun\u00edn 4 Block through a joint venture between a PDVSA subsidiary and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). This Block is an extra heavy oil field in the Orinoco Belt; it was an undeveloped greenfield project and thus far more risky than Petrozuata and Hamaca. Nevertheless, Venezuela agreed in the Jun\u00edn 4 Block treaty to apply a 10% discount rate (C-585), a rate that was endorsed by the National Assembly (C-586). Thus, the Venezuelan government has twice endorsed the application of a 10% discount rate for future cash flows generated by future projects riskier than an operating project. Outside the arbitration context, Venezuela itself uses discount rates that are close to, or lower than, those proposed by the Claimants.\n\n840.\n\nThe Claimants add that a significant body of arbitral tribunals have adopted discount rates comparable to the rates proposed by the Claimants, but have been largely ignored by the Respondent, like *Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador* (12%)618, *Enron v. Argentina* (12.6%)619, *Alpha Projektholding v. Ukraine* (12.14%)620, *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* (10.09%)621.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Award dated 5 October 2012 (CL-256).\n\n*Enron Corporation, Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/03, Award of 22 May 2007 (CL-60).\n\n*Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award dated 8 November 2010 (CL-253).\n\n*Gold Reserve Inc. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award dated 22 September 2014 (CL-328).\n\n841.\n\nTurning to the analysis of the Respondent's experts' conclusions, the Claimants observe that they have constructed a made-for-arbitration discount rate of 27.7% for the 2016 valuation (and 19.8% for the 2007 valuation), with absurd effects such as the result that five years before the expiry of the Association Agreements, every dollar would have been reduced to less than two cents. The major source of divergence between the experts is the country risk premium: 4.2% for the Claimants' experts and 18.1% for Brailovsky and Flores. The purpose of such a premium is to account for the increased uncertainty or volatility of the Projects' cash flows resulting from the Projects being located in Venezuela as opposed to a more developed economy, such as the United States. The country risk must be assessed on a but-for basis. The inquiry is what the country risk would have been for these Projects (considering their specific characteristics, including their Treaty and contractual protections) absent unlawful conduct by Venezuela. But that is not the exercise undertaken by the Respondent's experts.\n\n842.\n\nThe first error the Respondent's experts have committed in the Claimants' views is to include in the discount rate the near-default status of Venezuela's sovereign debt. Venezuela is on the brink of economic collapse. Its sovereign bond yield is around 23%. The Respondent's experts impute the risk of an expected sovereign debt default to the Projects. However, the Projects have not been, and will not be, in financial distress bordering a bankruptcy. To apply to the Projects a country risk premium that reflects the likelihood that Venezuela will default on billions of dollars of sovereign debt is entirely unjustified. A but-for analysis should not be confused with an actual analysis. There is little, if any, relationship between the riskiness of a loan to Venezuela, which is close to defaulting on its debt, and the riskiness of the Projects. International tribunals have rejected the notion that the cost of debt of a sovereign that is in or near default represents an appropriate measure of country risk for a commercial enterprise, like in the *EDF*622, and *Sempra Energy*623.\n\n*EDF International S.A. et al. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award of 11 June 2012 (CLEX-045).\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award dated 28 September 2007 (CL-59).\n\n843.\n\nIn the view of the Claimants, the second major conceptual flaw in the Respondent's experts' study is that they refuse to accept the principle that a State may not avoid or reduce its liability for violating international law by relying on its own propensity to violate international law. They have factored into their discount rates Venezuela's record of unlawful expropriations and other breaches of legal obligations owed to foreign investors. Their country risk includes expropriation risks. This attitude is also evidenced by the experts' reliance on data apparently obtained from IHS Global Insight in 2009. However, data from or derived from IHS are not tailored to the specific nature of the Projects and inappropriately include the risk of unlawful expropriation or other unlawful state measures. The inclusion of unlawful state action would result in higher discount rates and thus allow Venezuela to benefit from its own unlawful acts. The prospect of an unlawful expropriation can create risk, but only to the extent that an investment enjoys no legal protection from that unlawful act. Therefore, when an investment enjoys protection against an uncompensated and unlawful expropriation, the discount rate must exclude that risk, because the investment is not subject to it.\n\n844.\n\nThe Tribunal's finding on the Claimants' protection against unlawful expropriation should have resulted in Venezuela excluding the risk of uncompensated expropriation from its calculation of country risk in this phase of the proceedings. Venezuela suggests that while the risk of the specific expropriation of the Claimants' assets may be excluded from the discount rate, the general expropriation risk caused by the State's background conduct can still serve to increase the country risk premium. In the *Gold Reserve* case, involving Venezuela's unlawful treatment of a mining investment in violation of the applicable BIT's fair and equitable treatment provision, Venezuela's experts proposed a discount rate between 16.5% and 23.8%, incorporating a country risk premium of between 6.7% and 16.4%. The tribunal rejected these premiums because they took account of Venezuela's policies at the time. It considered that it was not appropriate to increase the country risk to reflect the market's perception that a State might have a propensity to expropriate investments in breach of BIT obligations. The tribunal was correct. Any other result would reward violations of international law, and create an incentive for a State to take property in violation of its international obligations. The tribunal ultimately adopted a 4% but-for country risk premium, yielding a total discount rate of 10.09%. This discount rate is consistent with the discount rates derived by the Claimants' experts.\n\n845.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Respondent nevertheless insists that the risk of uncompensated expropriation should be included in a discount rate, relying on the awards in *Tidewater*624 and *Flughafen Zurich*625. While *Tidewater* included expropriation risk in its valuation, there is an important distinction in comparison to *Gold Reserve*. *Tidewater* awarded compensation for a lawful expropriation. The same applies to the *Mobile* ICSID Award626. In any event, the *Tidewater* tribunal's analysis is unpersuasive and should not be followed. Reducing the value of the investor's compensation to account for the risk of unlawful conduct by the State creates a benefit for the wrongdoer. The *Tidewater* analysis allows compensation to be reduced based on a pattern of past unlawful conduct against other parties. As for *Flughafen Zurich*, the Respondent mischaracterizes what the tribunal did. The tribunal affirmed the principle that a State cannot benefit from its own wrongful acts. It found, however, that this principle did not apply to the specific facts of the case. The tribunal found that the 14.4% discount rate suggested by Venezuela was closer to reality than the 4.6% proposed by the claimants, and that it coincided with a 15% discount rate used in a business plan adopted prior to the expropriation. The only way to achieve full reparation, and to avoid a result in which a State profits from its own unlawful conduct, is to exclude from the discount rate the risks and occurrence of Venezuela's unlawful actions.\n\n*Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Award dated 13 March 2015 (R-642).\n\n*Flughafen Z\u00fcrich A.G. and Gesti\u00f3n e Ingenier\u00eda IDC S.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/19, Award dated 18 November 2014 (R-559).\n\n*Venezuela Holdings, B.V., et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award dated 9 October 2014 (CL-348).\n\n846.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the Respondent fails to account for the limited exposure of the Projects to general Venezuelan country risks. The Projects were largely insulated from such risks, as they (a) produced a commodity for which there is international demand; (b) sold their products abroad in U.S. dollars; (c) acquired critical inputs from international markets; (d) used little local capital; (e) were removed from population centers in Venezuela; and (f) had legal protections designed to reduce their exposure to adverse governmental actions. The Respondent's experts did not adjust their discount rate to take account of risk mitigating factors specific to the Projects, such as product sales abroad in U.S. dollars.\n\n847.\n\nThe Claimants' experts, by contrast, consider only the specific country risks to which the Projects would actually have been exposed in the but-for scenario. They did so by basing their country risk premium on the credit rating of the debt issued by the Petrozuata Project before the possibility of expropriation began to be reported publicly. The difference between that credit rating, and the credit rating of a comparable investment in a U.S. oil and gas project, yields the incremental country risk actually applicable to the Projects. It reveals how investors perceived the incremental risk of an investment in the Projects, taking into account their specific characteristics, including the fact that they had certain contractual and international law protections, but excluding the additional risks created by actual or potential unlawful conduct on Venezuela's part. The Respondent did not address any of the Project-specific factors. Its experts rely largely on the assertion that the Projects were not protected against expropriation.\n\n848.\n\nThe Claimants suggest clarifying further a number of notions that have been improperly used by the Respondent. Thus, there was a confusion made when the discount rate was conflated by the internal rate of return (IRR) that an investor would look for when deciding, at the outset, whether to invest in a proposed project. Venezuela points to Mr. McKee's testimony that the Claimants had a \"hurdle rate\" for their investment in the Petrozuata Project of 20% as support for the rate that Venezuela's experts now advocate for their valuation627. But IRR and a discount rate are different things: Only a discount rate measures risk; an IRR is the rate of return at which the net present value of future cash flows from a project equals zero. Witness Sheets explained: Once the risks at the beginning of a project are going to be reduced or eliminated, the discount rate would be lower, as the risks have been taken out of the project628. The critical distinction to be made is to know what level of risks remains in the project. To the extent risks go out of the project they would be discounted at a lower rate. On the other hand, the IRR would not be affected by such decrease.\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 3, p. 731:7-732:17.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Jeff. W. Sheets, dated 14 May 2014, para. 6; TR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 6, p. 1611:141612:7 (Sheets).\n\n849.\n\nThe Claimants explain in this regard that by the time of the illegal expropriation, the Projects had confirmed the existence of huge quantities of extractable EHCO, and thus had proven their ability to extract the oil, and the market for syncrude had been established. Accordingly, a great number of the risks that existed at the time of the investment decisions had disappeared by the time of the expropriation. Therefore, it would make little sense to apply the same measure of risk - the same discount rate - to the Projects at two different periods in their lives. The Respondent chose to ignore this distinction, even though its experts have recognized that an IRR and a discount rate serve different purposes and are used in different ways. The same distinction is made in Article 6 of the Jun\u00edn 4 treaty between Venezuela and China, which applies a 10% discount rate to future cash flows, while targeting an IRR of 18% (C-585). The Projects routinely applied different IRR measures and discount rates.\n\n850.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the comparison to a 3640-mile international gas pipeline from Alaska is not a useful comparator for the risk of the expropriated Projects in Venezuela. The Respondent seeks to convey the impression that the statements made by Conoco officers before the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee of the Alaska State Legislature justify the discount rates it is seeking in this case (C-575). Such comparison misses the mark. The proposed pipeline from Alaska would have been one of the riskiest construction project in the world. Nothing that has been said in respect of this project lends any support to the 27.7% discount rate that Venezuela now seeks to apply. Witness Sheets confirmed this understanding at the 2010 Hearing629. The discount rates referred to were specific to the risks associated to the Alaska pipeline. These discount rates have no bearing on the appropriate discount rates for the developed Projects in this case. Dr. Finizza's presentation to the Committee in 2006 can stand for not more than the fact that a project in Venezuela faces higher country risk than would an identical project in the U.S.\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 6, p. 1610:17-1611:6.\n\n851.\n\nFinally, the Claimants note that the Respondent is unable to find support in the case law for its exaggerated discount rates and instead cites a handful of easily distinguishable awards. In the *Himpurna v. Indonesia*630, the underlying asset was a geothermal electricity project that had only reached the exploration phase during an economic crisis in Indonesia. The project was exposed to high construction and operational risks because it was at a nascent stage and was driven to a single local market. The tribunal noted the claimant's failure in that case to account for country risk altogether.\n\n*Himpurna California Energy Ltd. (Bermuda) v. PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listruik Negara (Indonesia)*, Final Award dated 4 May 1999 (R-252).\n\n852.\n\nIn *Lemire v. Ukraine,* the tribunal applied a discount rate of 18.51%. That case is uncontroversial, when concluding that (a) a discount rate must reflect some measure of country risk; and (b) a company in the United States is exposed to less country risk than the same company would face in Ukraine631. The case presents a number of distinctive features: (a) First, *Lemire* involved damage to a small private broadcasting company operating exclusively within the Ukrainian market, and therefore depending on most volatile radio advertising revenue in post-Soviet Ukraine. (b) Second, a significant part of the venture's future prospects was based on the individual claimant personally, thus adding a risk relating to eventual succession issues. (c) Third, the asset being valued was at the pre-development stage. (d) Finally, because the broadcasting company had no debt, the tribunal applied a discount rate of 18% based on the cost of equity, instead of the 13% WACC. The *Lemire* decision offers no comparison and support for the application of the discount rate proposed by Venezuela in this case.\n\n*Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Award dated 28 March 2011 (R-461).\n\n853.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Respondent seeks to rely on the 18% discount rate applied by the *Mobil* ICC and ICSID tribunals. In the ICC Award *Mobil Cerro Negro v. PDVSA*632, (a) the tribunal mistakenly used the rate of return to ExxonMobil's shareholders as a basis for the discount rate applicable to the future stream of indemnity payments from PDVSA; the tribunal misunderstood the distinction between a discount rate, which measures future risks, and a historical rate of return, which measures past profitability; (b) it was left without a reasonable alternative to PDVSA's discount rates, and thus adopted a rate proposed by PDVSA; (c) finally, the *Mobil* ICC award decided (i) contractual \"Discriminatory Measures\" claims, (ii) based on contractual compensation provisions, and (iii) under Venezuelan law - not damages for the fair market value of an expropriated asset under customary international law. The more recent ICSID award in *Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela* adopted the same 18% discount rate633. The ICSID tribunal's concern was to avoid inconsistencies between the two cases. However, if this had been the main concern of the tribunal, it would have been preferable to follow the approach of the ICC tribunal in *ConocoPhillips v. PDVSA*, where a rate of 10.55% was applied to value the lost cash flows from one of the same Projects at issue here634. Although the *Mobil* ICSID tribunal included expropriation risk in its calculation of the discount rate (which departs from settled principles), it did so in the context of a lawful expropriation, subject to the compensation standards provided by the applicable treaty. In the instant case, Venezuela's expropriation was unlawful, and the customary international law standard of full reparation therefore applies. Any other outcome would allow Venezuela to profit from its own wrongdoing.\n\n*Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v. Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. and PDVSA Cerro Negro, S.A.*, ICC Case No. 15416/JRF/CA, Final Award dated 23 December 2011 (R-462).\n\n*Venezuela Holdings, B.V., et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award dated 9 October 2014 (CL-348).\n\n*Phillips B.V. v. Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited & ConocoPhillips Petrozuata Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.* (ICC 16849/JRF), Award dated 17 September 2012 (CL-255).\n\n854.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimants submit that in all events, specific discount rates adopted in previous decisions are necessarily less instructive than the legal and economic principles underlying the choice of a particular rate. Here, the legal principle is an award of full reparation. Therefore, the discount rate should reflect, but not overstate, the actual country risks to which these particular Projects, at their advanced stage of development and benefitting from important contractual and international law protections, would have been exposed in the but-for world. The discount rates adopted by the Claimants' experts are reasonable and conservative, and they are consistent with the discount rates adopted by other tribunals, PDVSA and Venezuela itself. By contrast, the discount rates presented by the Respondent's experts are inflated and designed to allow Venezuela to escape its obligation to provide full reparation or anything approaching it.\n\n*2. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n855.\n\nThe Respondent submits that basic principles must be observed in any serious discount rate analysis. One of those principles was described in the *Himpurna* case as \"the fundamental issue of country risk\"635. This means that a project in Venezuela cannot be evaluated with the same discount rate as a project in Texas. The Respondent's experts Brailovsky and Flores have presented a discount rate analysis that utilizes well-recognized and widely respected methods for calculating an appropriate discount rate. Their conclusion was that such a rate as of 26 June 2007 would be 19.8%. They also analyzed the proposed 2007 discount rate of the Claimants' experts, an average of 9.53%, showing that they effectively ignore the fundamental issue of country risk and do not even correctly apply their own methodology. The conclusions of the Respondent's experts are the only ones consistent with (i) those of other tribunals in cases involving the very same nationalization as it is at issue here and (ii) statements made by the Claimants' own representatives, their experts and counsel in other proceedings.\n\n*Himpurna California Energy Ltd. (Bermuda) v. PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listruik Negara (Indonesia)*, Final Award dated 4 May 1999, para. 364 (R-252).\n\n856.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimants are unable to distinguish this case from the two *Mobil* decisions, one in the ICC case636 and the other in the ICSID case637. Both were based on the 2007 nationalization, and both involved an upgrading project in the Orinoco Oil Belt under an association agreement that included \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions similar to those in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements. Both tribunals rejected Mobil's positions on quantum, awarding less than 10% of the claim; both held that the appropriate discount rate was 18%. The *Mobil* claimants could not avoid the fact that the Cerro Negro project at issue in their case, a sister project of Petrozuata and Hamaca, was in Venezuela, not in Texas, and that any proposed discount rate that does not take into account full country risk cannot be taken seriously. On the Respondent's side, the experts were the same as in this case; both *Mobil* tribunals obviously found their analyses persuasive.\n\n*Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v. Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. and PDVSA Cerro Negro, S.A.*, ICC Case No. 15416/JRF/CA, Final Award dated 23 December 2011 (R-462).\n\n*Phillips Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited & ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. v. Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.*, ICC Case No.16848/JRF/CA (C-16849/JRF), Award dated 17 September 2012 (CL-255).\n\n857.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that it explained the relevance of the reasons retained by the *Mobil* ICC tribunal in its letter submitted to this Tribunal on 18 March 2012. The Respondent noted that the Claimants misunderstand what the ICC tribunal was doing, which was obviously to select a discount rate to obtain the present value of future cash flows. The actual IRR of a particular project is not, as the Claimants seem to think, what the ICC tribunal relied on. But the minimum expected IRR a buyer would demand in determining whether to enter into the project, also known as the \"hurdle rate\", is of course relevant. If a project is not expected to yield an IRR at least equal to the hurdle rate, the company will not invest. The kind of returns the Claimants expected from the Projects is relevant in determining the hurdle rate prospective buyers would likely use in deciding whether to invest in the Projects at issue in this case. Witness McKee told the Tribunal that the Petrozuata Project was approved at about a 20% IRR638. Other evidence in the record, including the testimony of ConocoPhillips's own chief economist, Marianne Kah, in Alaska in 2006, and the testimony at the same Alaska hearing of Econ One's Dr. Finizza, the former chief economist of Arco (a former partner of Phillips in the Hamaca Project), are to the same effect (C-575).\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 3, p. 731:7-732:17.\n\n858.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that the *Mobil* ICSID Award is irrelevant because the discount rate was calculated in the context of a lawful expropriation, subject to the compensation standards provided by the applicable treaty. Several points are to be made. First, the discount rate analysis did not depend upon the issue of the legality of the expropriation. Second, the expropriation that was found lawful in the *Mobil* ICSID case is the same expropriation that is at issue here. Third, a willing buyer would consider all political risks in determining what discount rate to apply in calculating a purchase price for the Claimants' interests as of the valuation date, including not only expropriation, but also the risk of fiscal measures. Fourth, it is surprising that the Claimants are still relying on this argument although it became clear after the August 2016 hearing that no finding of unlawful expropriation has ever been made and that there was no bad faith negotiation. It is truly difficult to imagine a case more on point on the issue of discount rate than the two *Mobil* decisions.\n\n859.\n\nThe same rigorous discount rate analysis was performed by the same experts in *Tidewater v. Venezuela*639. This case also involved nationalization, albeit not as politically sensitive, as it related to the maritime service business. The tribunal adopted a country risk premium of 14.75%, yielding a total discount rate of approximately 26%. The tribunal stated that the country risk factor was not specific to the particular State measure that gives rise to the claim. Rather the country risk premium quantifies the general risks, including political risks, of doing business in the particular country. The inescapable fact is that these cases cannot be meaningfully distinguished from this case. They provide the most directly relevant and valuable guidance on the discount rate issue here.\n\n*Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Award dated 13 March 2015 (R-642).\n\n860.\n\nThe second point to be stressed, according to the Respondent, is that the Claimants' discount rate analysis cannot be reconciled with their own statements and positions taken in other proceedings. The Claimants try to confuse the issue by distinguishing the concept of the discount rate from that of internal rate of return or hurdle rate. It is elementary that the minimum expected by an investor in order to make its decision to invest in a project is precisely equivalent to the discount rate. If an investor's hurdle rate for a project is 20%, it will not invest in the project unless, applying a discount rate of 20% to the projected future cash flows, a positive result is achieved. Otherwise, the 20% expected IRR or hurdle rate would not be achieved based on the projected cash flows. The Respondent pointed out the connection between minimum expected IRR or hurdle rate, on the one hand, and discount rate, on the other, in its letter of 18 March 2012. As stated in a textbook, terms as \"minimum rate of return\", \"hurdle rate\", \"discount rate\" and similar, are all interchangeable with the term \"cost of capital\". They represent \"opportunity cost of capital\" and must not be confused with the \"financial cost of capital\", which is the cost of raising money by borrowing or issuing new bond or related debt/equity offerings. Other definitions of \"hurdle rate\" can be found. They focus on the notion of minimum rate of return required in order to make an investment. For setting such rate, risk, costs of capital, and projected investment returns are all factors to be considered. Anyone using a discount rate lower than the hurdle rate in determining whether to enter into a project would be grossly overpaying for that project. Witness McKee acknowledged that Conoco's hurdle rate for the Petrozuata Project was 20%. Witness Sheets explained that as an investor, they determined what kind of return they would get on the capital investment; that is what is referred to as the \"internal rate of return\". He agreed that if the Tribunal were to use a 10% discount rate, it would come up with a higher value than if you would use a 19% discount rate. The Claimants' expert, Mr. Moyes, noted in a presentation in the year 2013 that in the industry a 20-30% Expected Rate of Return is acceptable (R-560).\n\n861.\n\nAnother ConocoPhillips Executive Vice-President said in a meeting that their projects in Western Canada have rates of return above 20% (BF-465). The Claimants had argued that Dr. Finizza had supported a 10% discount rate in the proceeding in Alaska. But a document shows that the appropriate rate considered at the time by the Claimants and their experts was at least double of approximately 10%. In his 2005 presentation in the Alaska proceeding, Dr. Finizza explained that projects need to be evaluated at the risk-adjusted cost of capital, which may be above the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) due to the fact that a project is made riskier by uncertainty, political and economic risks (C-502). He distinguished between the expected IRR of a project and the threshold rate of return or hurdle rate. The latter rate, when retained between 12% and 15%, would be appropriate for a project that was without significant risk factors. Dr. Finizza further stated that a 25% discount rate would be appropriate for an oil project in Venezuela. He took the same position when he appeared before the Alaska State Legislative Committee in June 2006 (C519). The Claimants' counsel did not ask Dr. Finizza a single question on the subject at the 2010 hearing.\n\n862.\n\nMs. Kah took a similar position before the same Legislative Committee, when explaining that IRR is a very important measure that the company takes very seriously, because it does not want to invest in a project that will have such a low return that will dilute the return on capital employed (C-575). When looking at the energy industry in the U.S., the discount rate would probably be higher than the 12% retained for the U.S. in general. Ms. Kah's opinion was thus that a return of higher than 12%, presumably at least 15%, would be necessary for an energy project in the U.S. For a project in a developing economy with a country risk rating like that of Venezuela, the required return would be much higher. This position confirms what both Mr. McKee and Dr. Finizza stated, meaning that a discount rate in excess of 20% would be appropriate, even before the adverse conditions facing Venezuela today.\n\n863.\n\nThe Claimants have also contended that the discount rate produced by IHS Global Insight in 2009 are suspect and should not be given any evidentiary value. The Respondent's experts support those conclusions on the basis of a database of transactions in the oil and gas industry maintained by IHS Herold, a sister company of IHS Global Insight. This analysis shows that discount rates are highly correlated with location, and that higher rates are found in less developed regions, resulting in a media discount rate of 28.5% for Latin America. Working on the same database, the Respondent's expert Mr. Leitzinger testified that there was only about 1 in 1'000 chance that the value of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects would have been as high as the level LECG pro-posed640. At the 2010 Hearing, the Claimants did not examine Mr. Leitzinger on the subject. In response to a question asked by the Tribunal, Mr. Leitzinger stated that LECG presented a table with a series of transactions for other properties, none of them having the same reserves, the same production life, the same type of crude oil, or the same location, as the Projects relevant in the instant case. \"Averages of incomparable transactions don't make them comparable.\"641 At least you can establish regular ratios between reserve volume, production and prices paid. That was what he had done in his regression model.\n\nExpert Report of Jeffrey Leitzinger, 5 January 2015, para. 10.\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 11, p. 3104:15-22.\n\n864.\n\nThe Respondent notes that if this Tribunal would simply take the average of the discount rates proposed by ConocoPhillips and its experts for other oil projects and adjust them to the projects in Venezuela, it would be using a discount rate at or higher than the level proposed by Respondent's experts. To conclude, says the Respondent, this Tribunal should follow the example set by the two *Mobil* tribunals and *Tidewater*, whose analysis leads to the conclusion that the *ex ante* discount rate proposed by the Respondent's experts is eminently reasonable and the rate proposed by the Claimants would not even be reasonable for a similar project in the United States. The 18% discount rate cuts the Claimants' valuation of US$ 4,227 billion almost in half, *i.e.* US$ 2,509 billion for all three Projects, even when assuming that all other elements of their claim would be correct. Even this reduced amount is still grossly inflated. When compensation for concededly non-Discriminatory Actions is excluded, such amount is reduced to US$ 1,786 billion. When, in addition, the appropriate adjustments to the Claimants' production and cost assumptions are made, the pertinent amount becomes US$ 1,520 billion. After further using the proper price differentials, the valuation ends up with US$ 1,433 billion.\n\n865.\n\nWhen considering a 26 June 2007 valuation disregarding the compensation provisions, the Parties' respective *ex ante* valuations differ greatly, the pertinent amount representing for the Claimants US$ 5,854 billion and for the Respondent US$ 1,677 billion. Since the Claimants give full effect to the full fiscal regime existing as of 26 June 2007, the difference between the Parties is attributable mainly to the Claimants' use of an indefensibly low discount rate of 8.9%. If a rate of 18% would be used, this would cut the Claimants' valuation by more than 50%.\n\n866.\n\nIn a scenario where a 31 December 2016 valuation would be retained, the Claimants' *ex post* discount rate analysis suffers from the same fundamental flaws as their *ex ante* discount rate analysis. The Respondent's updated discount rate of 27.7% reflects current conditions, giving full effect to the \"fundamental issue of country risk, obvious to the least sophisticated businessman\", and is very similar to the rate of approximately 26% applied by the *Tidewater* tribunal. If a reasonable discount rate is used, the Claimants' valuation, when applying the compensation provisions, but taking all other assumptions of the Claimants as correct, is reduced from US$ 8,518 to 7,037 billion. The impact of the discount rate is not nearly as significant as in the *ex ante* calculation because discounting applies only for future cash flows, and the future cash flows in the *ex post* valuation begin in 2017 only. When the Claimants' valuation is adjusted by (i) using a reasonable discount rate, (ii) excluding compensation for concededly non-Discriminatory Actions and the Special Contribution, (iii) making the appropriate corrections to the Claimants' production and cost assumptions and (iv) using proper price assumptions, the resulting *ex post* valuation would be US$ 1,313 billion.\n\n867.\n\nFinally, when the compensation provisions would be disregarded, the Projects being set up as if they enjoyed fiscal and legal stabilization, the Respondents valuation of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects would be US$ 1,331 billion, whereas in the same setting, the Claimants demand for compensation is approximately US$ 14,119 billion. The Claimants use again a very low average of 11.54% for the three Projects. When the Claimants' valuation is subject to their 11.54% rate, their valuation would be US$ 14,119 billion, while the amount resulting from the input of the Respondent's discount rate would be US$ 11,404 billion.\n\n*3. The Tribunal's Findings*\n----------------------------\n\na. Basic elements\n-----------------\n\n868.\n\nThere is common ground between the Parties that the discount rate serves to convert expected future revenue (or cash flow) back to present value as of the date of valuation. It assists in determining the capital required at such date for the purpose of reaching the amount to which a creditor is entitled at a certain point in time in the future. In the instant case, such future amounts are the dividends to which the Claimants were entitled every year in each Project until the end of production (equivalent to the end of profit). Such rate is usually expressed in connection with the risk implied in reaching the future amount determined in the award. The analysis of the relevant risk therefore plays a large part in the determination of the discount rate.\n\n869.\n\nHowever, risk must not be the only focus. The risk inherent in an investment translates economically into the profit the investor must obtain in order to proceed with the investment. Therefore, risk and profit are complementary concepts; profit is commensurate with risk. One is closely related to the other. In an optimal scenario, the minimum profit an investor expects to obtain must cover the economic dynamic inherent in the risks associated to the particular business. This also means that an investment having a high-risk component must yield a correspondingly high profit to become and to remain attractive for an investor evaluating whether or not it wants to transfer assets into the project.\n\n870.\n\nWhile the respective amounts to be earned from the Projects as dividends in the future are based on the Projects economics, the same applies to the discount rate. The value of the Projects is the discounted present value of their future profits. The Claimants must be treated by reference to the situation they would have been in at the date of valuation. At that time, absent the expropriation, they would have lived with the expectation of obtaining dividends in the future as determined by the Tribunal. This expectation is the same they would have anticipated when operating the Projects in a but-for scenario at the time of valuation.\n\n871.\n\nThe amounts corresponding to the dividends to be earned in the future do not represent money placed in a bank account or in any other opportunity on the financial market. They are the profits resulting from the Projects, including all of their economic and financial components. Therefore, their calculation \"upwards\", towards the future, must be based on the same components. The profit they represent must be proportionally higher than the profit resulting from a savings account. If this was not so, there would be no investment in an industry, usually much more uncertain than placing money into a bank.\n\n872.\n\nThe discount rate reflects, to the extent applicable, the diversity of the sources of money and the related costs. The costs for money are determined by the suppliers of capital by reference to the nature and the size of risks that have to be covered. This discount rate includes the cost required for obtaining such capital.\n\n873.\n\nThe cost of debt is to be taken as it stands in the project's books, like bank loans, whereby the applicable interest to be paid must be reduced by the tax return available in the particular case.\n\n874.\n\nThe cost of equity capital includes money provided as risk-free, on a low interest rate, and money provided as industry-risk for specific industries, at higher cost and interest rate that reflects the risk component of such industry in general. For an investor operating with his own money, it is important to also take account of risks involved in the investment project itself. Under an economic and financial perspective, such risks must be compensated by higher returns to the investor. Otherwise, the investor would not invest in the specific project and use the money on the market place investing in bonds of similar projects or funding similar projects like a bank or other lenders would do. The coverage of these risks adds to the cost for equity capital. The determination of this component is difficult, as it must be driven by the characteristics of the specific project.\n\n875.\n\nThe past profit resulting from the investment represents the increase of value resulting from the business involved. It is usually expressed through a rate, based in particular on points of reference that can be observed with some regularity. Viewed from such perspective, such rate corresponds to the update factor. When taken from the opposite perspective, which is more hypothetical, the expected profit or dividends to be captured in the future can be traced back to the initial value of the project at the point in time when the valuation is made. This is the project inherent discount factor, which serves the reverse objective of the update factor.\n\n876.\n\nHowever, the economy of an investment does not consist only of a value representing the expected profit defined in relation to the inherent risks of the project. This is, in simple terms, the \"upper part\". The investment further comprises the costs the investor has to take into account for its own financing of the amounts to be invested into a particular project. This represents the \"bottom part\", corresponding to the cost - represented in terms of a rate of money required for the purpose of funding the investment. Both experts' teams use in this respect the same concepts, referring on the one hand, to a risk-free rate, and on the other hand, to an industry risk-rate, which is higher and related to the risks implied in a certain industry in general, independent from a particular project.\n\n877.\n\nThe discount rate must reflect the costs for the increase in capital that is required to reach the required amounts representing dividends in the future. First, account must be taken of the rate of profit on which the Projects are based, which is equal to the monetary portion of risks assumed by the investors expressed as a rate. The discount effect means that the dividends are to be brought down to present value in proportion to such rate.\n\n878.\n\nSecond, to determine the value required to bring a capital awarded to present value, it is also necessary to take account of the financing costs required to fund an industry producing further profit. Such value represents the financing costs of the investment, which can be determined by reference to the respective conditions applicable on the relevant market. In terms of rate, the riskfree rate and the industry rate are relevant here. Here again, the input of the discount rate has the effect that the dividends are brought to present value.\n\n879.\n\nThe Respondent's experts consider that the discount rate, and, at the time the investor enters into a project, its \"hurdle rate\" are minimum rates642. The Claimants' experts consider that the discount rate serves a different purpose than the hurdle rate643. The experts also debate the purpose of the internal rate of return (IRR), as a rate of profit calculated by the investor at the time of the investment. Irrespective of the differences between the experts, and even assuming that the rates determined by the investor or the shareholders at the time of considering the investment are minimum rates, nothing prevents the investor from earning more than the minimum. In such a case, as well as in the hypothesis where the discount rate is lower than the hurdle rate, it is not correct to speak of a windfall or, in case of arbitration, of excessive compensation644. Such recovery would only imply a risk of double payment when the specific discount rate was too low for the particular project and thus allow compensation that is not discounted fully to the date of present valuation. The reverse can also occur, when the investment project accounts for high discount rates that exceed by far their cost of financial capital. The proper method consists of avoiding overruns in both opposite directions.\n\n\"The hurdle rate is the minimum amount of return that a person requires before they will make an investment in something.\" TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3374:4-7 (Brailovsky).\n\nCf. Abdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, paras. 187/188.\n\nAs is done by Brailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 354; Additional Expert Report on Country Risk in Discount Rate, 19 May 2017, para. 3. The experts' position comes down to the assumption that the IRR and the discount rate are the same; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 14, p. 4083:174084:11 (Brailovsky).\n\n880.\n\nThis also means that for an on-going project, at a point in time after the hurdle rate was observed, the IRR is not, or must not be the same as the discount rate. The IRR is the profit the investor expects and that it earns for his shareholders. As the Parties have explained, various sources on the Tribunal's record mention that ConocoPhillips' IRR was 20%. It is usually above the discount rate that sets the limit of cost of capital and thus of the profitability of the investment vehicle. Documents from the early period when the Projects were initiated noted IRR's higher than discount rates regularly set at 10%645. The Respondent's experts cannot be right when they reject this difference, treating IRR as representing the discount rate in the absence of debt646. The Treaty concluded between Venezuela and China on 17 April 2010 shows the distinction when the discount rate applicable to the recovery of the investment was set at 10%, while the mixed company's operation was aimed at obtaining an IRR of 18%647.\n\nThe IRR was 14.9% in the Memoria Descriptiva of October 1996 (C-92), 14.2% in the Hamaca Project II Business Plan of 30 April 1999 (C-461, p. 7, 25), 14.17% in the Corpoven presentation of 9 May 1996 (C-108) and 24% in the Feasibility Study prepared by Conoco and Maraven in August 1992 (C-73, p. 7, 45, 48, 95). A Board of Directors' meeting of Petrozuata noted on 7 December 2000 an IRR at 34% and a net present value of US$ 537 million at 7.7% (C-326).\n\nConsolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 384.\n\nArticle 6 (C-585). An expert explained: \"You discount the cash flow at a particular Discount Rate, but you have an IRR, you always want to have an IRR which is above the Discount Rate, so you have a cushion. You have value in the Project.\" TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 13, p. 3964:1-5 (Spiller).\n\n881.\n\nThe hurdle rate is no longer relevant once the \"hurdle\" has been passed and the investment is made. When the investment vehicle is on-going and legally binding on the participants there is no longer such a hurdle. While the hurdle rate may be based on a methodology similar to that of discount rates, it may be higher than the average cost of capital if this is the option of the investor who wants to obtain a higher profit than the one that would correspond to the project's discount rate. In such a case, the hurdle rate and the IRR, expressed as the investor's hurdle, are different from and higher than the discount rate.\n\n882.\n\nThus, the Respondent's experts are basically correct when they state that a buyer's hurdle rate is the minimum acceptable rate of return it will receive as an investor648 (except when he sets a higher hurdle because this is how he understands his own interests). At that point in time, the discount rate (corresponding to the hurdle rate) reflects the expected rate of profit.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 388/389.\n\n883.\n\nThe Parties' respective positions are not substantially different from what has been explained above in a language slightly different from the one used by the experts. The Parties' experts use their professional language and they rely on concepts that serve as vehicles for a great number of complex developments, some of which give the impression that they serve primarily the purpose of creating confusion instead of assisting the Tribunal with information leading to useful results. The study of this voluminous material shows that the disputed elements are related to a number of assumptions made by reference to sources that sometimes have nothing or little to do with the Projects at the core of the instant case. The Tribunal will in a first step take away a number of such assertions and options, without enumerating all of them, before focusing on the main elements to be considered for the purpose of reaching appropriate conclusions.\n\n884.\n\nThe Tribunal would have preferred to be faced with proposals presented clearly by the experts in such a way that the Tribunal could reach a decision without becoming involved too deeply into the field of economics which, after all, should be the experts' foremost area of expertise. However, such a guided choice is impossible when the experts' proposed discount rates are, respectively, 11.6% and 27.7%, a difference of more than 16%. As another Tribunal noted in a similar situation where the opposing rates were 8.5% and 26%: \"There was an air of unreality with respect to both Parties' arguments with respect to the DCF method\"649. The Tribunal tried by letters dated 4 and 12 April 2017 to direct the experts to confer with the aim of narrowing the gaps between their respective positions related to discount rates, in general, and country risk, in particular. By letter dated 25 April 2017, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the experts were unable to succeed with such task. There were manifestly grounds to bring the respective opposing positions at least a little bit closer, based in particular on the results of the two hearings held in February and March 2017, where a number of errors in the experts' assumptions were highlighted. The Tribunal made an effort that seemed to be the minimum of a reasonable approach. It has been faced by a surprising and indefensible refusal, originating - on one or on both sides - either from the experts themselves or from one or both Parties, through the instructions they had given. The Tribunal's approach may imply certain approximations the Parties may have not wanted to undertake by offering their comprehensive assistance. The members of the Tribunal, being exposed to suggestions so extreme that they manifestly cannot be retained, will have to make certain adjustments that some experts may consider to be a deviation from economic discipline650.\n\n*Himpurna California Energy Ltd. (Bermuda) v. PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listruik Negara (Indonesia)*, Final Award dated 4 May 1999, para. 355 (R-252).\n\nThis is said under the assumption that such a discipline exists. Serious doubts are permitted given the extreme discrepancies of the results from highly educated professionals who should have a scientific background allowing conclusions coming closer to one another in their elaboration and in their results.\n\n885.\n\nThe matter to be addressed as a priority is the full hybrid complex of a variety of intellectual and mathematical distortions on the subject of country risk. This needs to be looked at first, whereas the consideration of risk-free and general industry-risk based financial resources is nearly agreed between the experts who nevertheless thought it was preferable to demonstrate once more their ability to entertain controversial esoteric debates rather than providing assistance to the Tribunal which is responsible for resolving the case.\n\nb. U.S. market assumptions\n--------------------------\n\n886.\n\nIn many respects, the Claimants' experts refer to U.S. market characteristics as a basis and then simply add adjustments to what they assume reflect differences of the comparable concepts pertinent for the situation in Venezuela. In essence, the Claimants' experts purported after 2008 to proceed with a \"but-for valuation of Claimants' interests in the Projects\" on the valuation date651. But, in fact, they addressed the matter through data available on the U.S. market that is then simply adjusted to Venezuelan market components and without or with very little further scrutiny of the economics of the Projects. This approach is reflected already at the first level of considering country risk, which is presented as a premium accounting for the increased uncertainty or volatility of the Projects' cash flows resulting from the Projects being located in Venezuela rather than a more developed economy, such as the United States652.\n\nPreliminary Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 12 September 2008, para. 54.\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 412.\n\n887.\n\nIn the May 2014 report of the Claimants' experts, the Venezuela component of country risk disappeared:\n\nTo determine the extent of country risk applicable to the Projects, we evaluate the (incremental) risk of the Projects' cash flows compared to a similar project located in the U.S. To do so, we first identify the potential sources of country risk, and then we implement a methodology that reflects the market's perception of the Projects' exposure to overall country risk.653\n\nDamages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2014, para. 56.\n\n888.\n\nWhen they discuss the comparison with the Alaska pipeline, the Claimants accept that the information conveyed stands at least for the fact that a project in Venezuela faces higher country risk than would a similar project in the U.S.654\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 454.\n\n889.\n\nOne of the factors used by the Claimants' experts as support for low discount rates is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) model that serves to pull most relevant rates together and offers a final rate to be used for further valuation. The experts were not always explicit in showing that this model works with U.S. market assumptions, and retains Venezuela risk factors as they are looked at from a U.S. perspective, without accepting any link or relationship to the local country market. Thus, when calculating the appropriate WACC for the Projects, they \"first estimate the industry risk through the calculation of a WACC for a U.S.-based company in the same industry segment as the Projects (oil and gas exploration and production, or E&P)\". To take account of the Venezuelan component of the Projects, they \"then adjust it to reflect differences in the relative risks of investing in Venezuela versus the U.S.\"655. For this purpose, they did not use Venezuelan market data, because these data, as they say, were not available and in any event not reliable. The Respondent's experts go a step further in noting that this is simply playing with bond ratings for the purpose of reaching what appears to have been their target for the discount rate656.\n\nDamages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2014, para. 102.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 479/480.\n\n890.\n\nWhen they use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate cost of equity (part of the WACC), the Claimants' experts use data from U.S. capital markets, while noting that a cost of equity estimated from U.S. data fails to account for the fact that the activities take place outside of the U.S. To address this, say the experts, they included a country risk premium to account for the different political and macroeconomic risks in Venezuela as compared to the U.S.657 However, when determining such country risk, the experts choose the sovereign debt approach that was based on the Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI) developed by JP Morgan, a U.S. bank658 in 1999 -nearly 10 years before their report- and that did not estimate country risk directly but in comparison with the total market capitalization of all instruments included in the index. The index is defined as a market debt benchmark, which seems to have limited relevance for a cost of equity determination. The global factor determined by the index was 5.6% for Venezuela. However, the experts choose a 5-year horizon resulting at the end of July 2008 in a country risk premium of 4.37%; the experts did not refer to any source for such an assumption659. With this premium, the experts made an adjustment based on the rating of Petrozuata's bonds in 1998 and further determined Petrozuata's debt to country risk in comparison to U.S. exploration and production (E&P) companies, using an index of U.S. industrial bonds whose ratings were two levels above Venezuelan sovereign debt. Whereas the experts purportedly rely on Venezuelan bond ratings, the reference from where the calculation starts is again the U.S. market. Finally, while accepting that equity is more exposed to country risk than debt, they assumed that Petrozuata had an optimal capital structure that is the same as the average of the U.S. E&P firms and thus adopted a 26.5% debt portion - all this without any verification by reference to companies operating in the Venezuelan oil industry or, what would be the basic requirement, to the company under examination, *i.e.* Petrozuata660. The experts' conclusion illustrates their approach:\n\nA willing buyer of the Projects would have an industry-representative capital structure. Reliable information for such a generic buyer is not available from the sample of Venezuelan E&P companies with the same risk characteristics as our target Projects. Accordingly, we used as a proxy the average capital structure observed in the U.S. sample of E&P companies, that is, a debt to equity ratio of 27%. Our use of U.S. data is supported by the fact that the E&P industry is basically an international industry, and that many U.S. companies have investments in other countries.661\n\nPreliminary Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 12 September 2008, Appendix E, para. 5. The experts added that U.S. data are more reliable \"than analogous data from Venezuelan capital markets, to the extent that such Venezuelan data exist\". In other words, the experts concluded that Venezuelan data were not reliable although they had not verified whether such data exist. In the report covering this Annex, the experts were more affirmative: \"We use the optimal debt-to-equity ratio from non-integrated exploration and production oil and gas firms in the U.S., as data from the Venezuelan market is limited and unreliable.\" (para. 113). Thus, the experts concluded that Venezuelan data were unreliable before they undertook the effort to search whether such data exist. They had 8 years to remedy this defect. In all later reports, the caution about maybe available data from Venezuela was no longer mentioned.\n\nLECG-171, referred to in Preliminary Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 12 September 2008, Appendix E, para. 17, footnote 21.\n\nPreliminary Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 12 September 2008, Appendix E, para. 18.\n\nCf. *ibidem*, Appendix E, paras. 16-36. As mentioned below, the debt portion was finally set at 26%.\n\n*Ibidem*, Appendix E, para. 50.\n\nc. Discount rates on foreign markets\n------------------------------------\n\n891.\n\nBoth expert teams made extensive studies of risk ratings derived from a great number of markets internationally or even world-wide. While such comparisons can be instructive in various regards, they suffer from the fundamental handicap of not being driven either to the market concerned in the instant case - the Venezuelan oil market - or, more specifically to the Projects that are the object of the valuation and thus at the core of the determination of the discount rate, and in particular, its inherent risk component.\n\n892.\n\nThe Respondent's experts rely in very large part on five approaches to determine discount rates, *i.e.* the Country Risk Rating Model published by International Investor, SPEE, their own Stock Market Data, and the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. All of these sources are grounded internationally, with the exception of the last one, which contains appraisals of more than 6,000 oil and gas properties in the State of Texas. A fifth source should be mentioned separately, because it provides information on upstream oil projects in Venezuela, assembled by the IHS Global Insight662. When all these sources are taken together, the range of discount rates under an *ex post* valuation is between 21.8% and 29.5%663. The experts then create another group, comprised of different methods represented by four different categories of indicators, *i.e.* (i) ICAPM, a method using the relative standard deviation of the stock markets of Venezuela and an advanced economy; (ii) ICAPM, other methods; (iii) methods combining non-CAPM expected rate of profit with the country risk rating model; and (iv) direct non-CAPM estimates. The Respondent's experts conclude from this comparison that the mean of cost of capital of the four groups is 27.7% for October 2016, which is the discount rate they apply to obtain the Net Present Value (NPV) of the Projects as of the *ex post* valuation date664. The experts do not explain the respective weight given to each one of these groups that show very different compositions. It appears that, in very large part, these groups do not reflect assessments based on the Venezuelan market, and that, when they do, the reference is not different than when considering stock markets of Venezuela. No connection is made to the economics of any of the Projects under valuation. This is striking. The experts state as one of their fundamental points that the discount rate reflects the expected rate of profit, at least as a minimum, which rate is reflected by the cost of capital as it is \"looked at from the perspective of the project\"665. However, none of the approaches and methods they use as guidelines implies any perspective focusing on the Projects.\n\nThe data relate to 2009 only and were given for oil projects in Venezuela generally; cf. Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, paras. 378(b), 520/521; Additional Expert Report on Country Risk in Discount Rate, 19 May 2017, para. 11.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 378, See further paras. 478-552.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 380/381, 538, 540, Table 34, para. 578.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 390.\n\n893.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the Respondent's experts express a number of limitations in respect of a methodology based on the CAPM approach that to a certain extent, must also extend to ICAPM, its international companion. This method, they say, explains the pricing mechanism in financial markets under the assumption of perfect competition. They note that the theory has a poor track record for predicting actual discount rates for financial assets and that it also has serious limitations when the asset to be valued is a stand-alone physical oil project, which is not liquid, for which there are few buyers whose portfolios are not fully diversified. They conclude that the theory simply cannot be applied without important modifications when perfect competition does not prevail. Therefore, in this case, the CAPM can only provide a floor to the discount rate666. They further add that the CAPM was supplemented by adding a country risk premium, generating the ICAPM, the international version of the model. The experts note, however, that beyond the ICAPM other approaches must be used to determine discount rates \"that are free from the strictures of that theory's assumptions\"667. Nevertheless, as explained above, the experts use the ICAPM (in undefined proportion) as one of their basis for suggesting their discount rate of 27.7%, further noting that when relying exclusively on non-ICAPM methods, this rate would go down to 25.1%668. In any event, the reliance on numerous ICAPM based sources or other sources using comparable data under another methodology is largely misguided when not focusing on the Projects at hand and their economic environment. Additionally, as these Projects are on-going in a but-for scenario, there is no room for any \"buyer\"-oriented perspective that might be influenced by comparison with other or maybe similar markets.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 394, 404. The experts emphasize the word \"floor\". See further paras. 492-497.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 400.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 383. The experts retained for their valuation ICAPM-based methods for more than 50%; cf. the same Report, page 275, Table 34.\n\n894.\n\nThe Respondent's experts also suggest that most of the CAPM estimates are made from U.S. stock market data. This market is highly liquid, while a physical project, usually, is not, as it has to face a limited market, where transactions take a long time to be concluded. To take account of this constraint applicable to the Projects, the Respondent's experts proceed with a liquidity adjustment of 4% to the first two groups of methods based on the ICAPM, with the effect of an average increase of the discount rate, based on the four groups, of 2%. This results, as they say, in a \"discount rate (cost of capital) after liquidity adjustment\" of 27.7%669. However, they also noted, at an earlier stage, that the same percentage represents the mean of the cost of capital of the four groups mentioned above, not considering an adjustment for liquidity670. This is confusing. The Tribunal understands that this last figure must be lower than 27.7%, but that for the experts the final percentage is 27.7%, as further confirmed by the Respondent's briefs.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 538, 540, Table 34.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 381.\n\n895.\n\nThe Tribunal notes first that the Respondent's experts' argument is circular. The lack of liquidity is evaluated by comparison with the most liquid U.S. stock market, while it is asserted -correctly - that the discount rate should be based on a Project-oriented valuation and not by reference to U.S. data for stock marketed companies that have very little, or indeed nothing to add to such examination. Since the Projects were set up, there was never a liquid market for revenues in the form of dividends from oil production and upgrading. There was no market either for the shares, all the more so since the matter was governed by the Association Agreements. Therefore, the factor of illiquidity, if it was relevant, was at all times included as a commercially relevant component of the Projects and therefore also included in the valuation made by the investors, be it as discount rate or the hurdle rate. Thus, as the Claimants' experts have noted, there would be an obvious double counting if any lack of marketability was added to country risk671. It may also be observed that country risk cannot be measured, in the instant case, by reference to markets. The discount rate serves to determine the present value of future dividends. These are all characteristics exclusively related to the Projects at issue in the instant case.\n\nAbdala/Spiller, Report on the Project-Specific Country Risk Applicable to the Claimants' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2017, para. 33.\n\n896.\n\nThe Claimants' experts, on the other hand, considered the comparable transactions and market multiples approaches as a means of testing the results of their DCF analysis. They examined over 1,600 crude oil exploration and production transactions that occurred between 2001 and the first half of 2008 for which reliable data was available. This approach is useful when there are numerous, recent, arm's length transactions of assets that are similar or comparable to the asset being valued. The general ranges of value, taken as a whole, provide an opportunity to confirm the conservative nature of the results of their DCF calculations. The experts did not identify any particular transaction that could be considered directly comparable in all material respects to the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects (including in terms of size, location, and type of crude oil), but they say that they were able to evaluate the per-barrel transaction price of a sizeable number of recent transactions relating to heavy crude oil interests. Similarly, they examined transactions relating to shallow water projects and assets in an effort to find comparables for the Corocoro Project. They did not identify any particular transaction that could be considered directly comparable in all material respects to Corocoro, but the transactions, in the aggregate, offer a useful and independent basis for confirming the conservative nature of their DCF analysis.\n\n897.\n\nThe experts also sought to corroborate the results of their DCF analysis by examining the valuation multiples that arise from publicly-traded exploration and production companies extracting heavy crude oils in Canada and elsewhere. Although they did not identify a particular company directly comparable to the Petrozuata or Hamaca Projects, they found that this exercise provides a useful and independent means for confirming the conservative nature of their DCF results672.\n\nCf. Preliminary Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 12 September 2008, paras. 57/58; Appendix G completed by Appendix D to the Second Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 2 November 2009, and the Rebuttal Report to Respondent's Experts' Second Reports, 15 April 2010.\n\n898.\n\nThe \"market multiples\" approach (sometimes called the comparable company approach) is similar from an economic viewpoint to the comparable transactions approach. The approach is applied by (1) identifying publicly-traded firms that are sufficiently similar to the target enterprise, (2) computing a ratio that expresses the firm's value to some relevant variable (*e.g.* earnings, production, proved reserves), and (3) applying the observed multiple to the variable (in this case reserves) to determine its value. If the stock market is reasonably efficient then the prices of equity shares incorporate the market's knowledge and expectations of the future business prospects for firms and thus provide a reasonable estimate of fair market value. If the selected public firms are sufficiently similar to the target enterprise, it is possible to draw an inference as to the probable value of the target based on an industry appropriate multiple. In this case, the relevant indicator of value, which they have identified, is the ratio of the enterprise value to the number per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) of proved reserves.\n\n899.\n\nThe Claimants' experts conclude that their analysis confirms the conservative nature of the value that they calculated for the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects using the DCF approach.\n\n900.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that without denying the interest of multiple comparisons, with either projects or transactions multiples, such methods do not permit to arrive at conclusions concrete enough to be applicable to the Projects in the instant case. The experts accept that they did not identify any particular transaction that could be considered directly comparable in all material respects to the Projects. Therefore, if no reasonable comparison can be derived from the multiple comparisons and analysis of a large number of oil production sites worldwide, what is the purpose of such an exercise if it does not lead to concrete results in respect of the Projects at issue in the instant case? Such comparisons may show differences between extremes where discount rates may be discovered. Yet, this does not lead to any concrete result.\n\n901.\n\nSimilarly, it is hypothetical or rather speculative to conclude from a comparison to average cost of debt of supposedly comparable E&P companies located in China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Colombia and Brazil, as compiled by the U.S. company Bloomberg, that the Projects' cost of debt was 7.31% as of June, and 6.06% as of December 2016673, when data must have been available from the Projects' accounts at least for the historical period.\n\nAbdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 175.\n\nd. General country risk assumptions\n-----------------------------------\n\n902.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that while it may be true that the general economic situation of Venezuela may have a negative effect on the Projects' economics, for instance by increasing the risk of increased taxation, political instability, turbulences on the labor market or lack of technical supply, there is no point in drawing conclusions from the risks implied in Venezuela's sovereign debt, close to collapsing, in respect of the financial standing of the Projects that enjoy considerable autonomy compared to the country's economy taken as a whole.\n\n903.\n\nOn the other hand, governmental policy directions affecting Venezuela's oil industry in general (whether they are called country risk or not), like royalties and taxes, currency exchange limitations, OPEC production restrictions, and many other regulatory measures related to the conduct of oil projects must be taken into consideration. The Petrozuata Offering Circular of 1997 (C75) contains an extensive enumeration of such risks that do not need to be listed here again. However, in this respect as well, the impact of such governmental measures cannot be converted into the risk component of a specific project without further considering many other factors and mainly those related to the particular project at stake. The financial statements also contain comprehensive lists of risks affecting the Projects674.\n\nSee, for instance, the Report for Petrozuata for the years 2006/2007, p. 18-21 (CLEX-093).\n\n904.\n\nThe same concern applies to comparisons made by the Claimants' experts with many other loans that are rated by professional agencies for the purpose of impacting the financial market. The debt quality of the respective borrowers may allow indirect conclusions as to the inherent risks of the relevant business, but this does not allow an immediate transfer of such risks for the purpose of identifying the risk components of the Projects at issue without further verification. Therefore, the Tribunal finds the Claimants' experts' assumptions in this respect, without denying some intrinsic interest, to be close to simple speculations not connected to the characteristics of the Projects. The experts must have been aware of the weakness of such position when they stated: \"In any case you need to analyze the project-specific risk and not the country risk in general.\"675 This is also the Claimants' position: \"The relevant inquiry, then, is what the country risk *would have been* for these Projects (considering their specific characteristics, including their Treaty and contractual protections) absent unlawful conduct by Venezuela.\"676\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 10, 2689:17-2690:8 (Spiller). And again: \"... the country risk ought to be Project-specific\", TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 11, p. 3335:7/8 (Spiller).\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 412.\n\n905.\n\nIn any event, even if bond ratings like those of the Venezuelan sovereign debt are taken as reference, they cannot represent more than a bottom line on which the specifics of the Projects have to be build and translated into costs leading to appropriate rates. The bond rating as such is not pertinent for a project-driven valuation. The risk of a physical project attracting foreign investments is much higher than the risk of a bond. If this was not the case, the investor would simply buy bonds, which include country risk, but not other risks inherent in the particular investment677.\n\nBrailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 398(c).\n\ne. The risk of expropriation and taxation\n-----------------------------------------\n\n906.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the discount rate should not serve as a premium for unlawful acts committed by the host State and detrimental to the investment. Therefore, it is not appropriate to include the risk of unlawful expropriation or other unlawful state measures into the determination of the risk/profit equation of the Project, and henceforth, into the discount rate.\n\n907.\n\nThe Claimants, however, go too far when they submit that no expropriation risk should be considered. This is not correct in view of the protection provided by the BIT against illegal acts committed by the host State, which delineate, conversely, the scope left for legal intrusions from the State affecting the economics of an investment. Thus, expropriation is permitted within the limits determined by Article 6 of the BIT. This includes the right of the investor to be awarded \"just compensation\". As the Claimants have submitted this standard is not as exact as full reparation, with the effect that if just compensation is actually paid, the investor must assume the risk of being deprived of compensation allowing full recovery for the loss suffered. To this extent, the Treaty protection has its limits, which translate into a risk inherent to the investment.\n\n908.\n\nAs to the principle, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that unlawful conduct should not be converted into a benefit for the wrongdoer.\n\n909.\n\nThe same principle applies in respect of the consequences of discriminatory actions. To the extent that the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements provide for a limited indemnity for the Class B Shareholders, the difference, representing uncovered loss, must count as a risk of the Projects that translates into the discount rate.\n\n910.\n\nTherefore, one of the basic assumptions of the Claimants' experts, *i.e.* that \"in these proceedings the discount rate must be free of expropriation risk and of the risk of wrongful taxation\"678 must be tampered. The Projects were not free of the risk of expropriation, provided it was lawful within the framework of Article 6 of the BIT. They were also exposed to the risk of increased taxation, however within the limits determined by the compensation provisions. Therefore, the Claimants' experts' criticism of the Respondent's experts on these points, expropriation and taxation, is not persuasive679.\n\nRebuttal Report to Respondent's Experts' Second Reports, 15 April 2010, para. 9.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 10: \"The differences between the country risk premium we use and the country risk premium used by B&W [Brailovsky&Wells], in turn, is due to B&W's failure to isolate the expropriation and wrongful taxation risk elements embedded in this premium, risks that the Projects would not have faced in the but-for world.\" In their earlier reports, the Claimants' experts assumed an income tax of 34% for Petrozuata and Hamaca. In fact, in 2007, the income tax in the hydrocarbons industry rose to 50%, and the Claimants had concluded that such increase should not trigger the applicability of the compensation provisions in the instant case. The experts changed their tax scenario in their Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2014, paras. 2, 4, and in their Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, Supplemental Report, 13 October 2014, footnote 9, paras. 19, 249.\n\n911.\n\nAt a later stage, in 2014, the Claimants' experts moved from their initial position and focused more on the Projects' production and cost parameters. They noted: \"A major difference in the inputs selected by B&F [Brailovsky&Flores] relates to the Projects' expected operational performance in the absence of expropriation.\"680 Additionally, when enumerating the specific features of the Projects that support the experts' low country risk premium, they state:\n\nThe Projects' private shareholders not only enjoyed specific protections against expropriation in the BIT but also had specific protections against adverse actions by Venezuela in the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements, which further limited their exposure to political and regulatory risk.681\n\nAdditionally, the Claimants' experts note that the Projects contain their own risk management when considering the protection available through bilateral investment treaties and the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements682. Nonetheless, when the experts analyze the Petrozuata Agreement they take as a basis the years 2002-2004, arguing that the Petrozuata's credit ratings were affected thereafter by reports on possible expropriations683.\n\nDamages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, Supplemental Report, 13 October 2014, para. 6.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 86(d).\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 192.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 118; Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 89.\n\n912.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls that the Claimants' experts were instructed not to examine the application of the Windfall Profit Tax (WPT). Consequently, they did not consider either the potential of an impact of this taxation on the risks inherent in the Projects.\n\nf. The risk inherent in the credit rating of debt\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n913.\n\nThe Claimants rely heavily on the risk component included in the rating for the Petrozuata bonds. As noted above, the experts restricted their analysis of but-for cost of debt to the years 20022004, considering that the later reports on expropriation risks would impact this valuation. The experts' years of reference are thus more than 10 years before the effective valuation date and based on a hypothesis that is in contradiction with their acceptance that the Projects were protected by the BIT. At the time they wrote the May 2014 Report and the 2016 Consolidated Report, the experts knew that the BIT was applicable since 2005/2006684. Nevertheless, the experts are of the view that the Projects' credit risk profile would have maintained the BB rating it had in the 2002-2004 period through to December 2016685. No evidence is provided for such an assertion, which simply conveys the experts' personal opinion.\n\nThe ownership in the Projects was transferred to CPZ on 27 July 2005, to CGP on 11 August 2005, and to CPH on 22 September 2006, respectively; cf. 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, para. 276.\n\nConsolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, paras., 91, 173; see also Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2014, para. 119. Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, Supplemental Report, 13 October 2014, para. 89, further referring to the Merrill Lynch Emerging Markets Corporate Plus Index, once again not sourced on the Venezuelan oil market.\n\n914.\n\nThis opinion is not without contradiction. In support of the downward trend of the lenders risks since the early days of the investment, the Claimants' experts argue that \"many of the material risks initially associated with the Projects were no longer present as of 2016 (such as, for example, construction and development risks), and given the reduction in risk free rates, the interest rates required by bond holders as of 2016 would have been lower than those offered by lenders in 1997\"686. Such reduction does not affect, say the experts, the country risk component of cost of equity: \". because of Venezuela's increased fiscal deficit and the deterioration in its overall macroeconomic situation, the Projects could be adversely affected due to other political risk factors, such as an increase in the risk of supply chain disruptions\"687. The Tribunal observes, firstly, that these arguments are incomplete in light of the available information of risks characteristic of the oil market in Venezuela and in respect of the Projects in particular, as they are enumerated extensively in the Petrozuata Offering Circular and in other official reports. Secondly, the experts' estimation of risks in Venezuela is inconsistent with the use of an initial credit rating in 2004, without further verification in respect of the following years, and this in reliance on a proxy of the U.S. corporate market688.\n\nReport on the Project-Specific Country Risk Applicable to the Claimants' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2017, para. 12.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 32.\n\nCf. also Brailovsky/Flores, Additional Expert Report on Country Risk in Discount Rate, 19 May 2017, para. 19.\n\n915.\n\nThe Tribunal does not share the Claimants' experts' view that the bond ratings can be seen as equal to the Projects' risk ratings pertinent for the investors689. As the Respondent's experts say, \"the risks of investment in equity, particularly in the case of non-financial assets, must be higher than those for an investment in bonds\"690. The risk of lenders is certainly below the risk assumed by the investors who are directly involved in the operation of the Projects and must be awarded revenue higher than the benefit obtained by the lenders. Therefore, the country risk assessment made by the Claimants' experts at the level between 4 and 5% has no real relationship with the economics of the Projects as defined in the official documents supporting the Petrozuata bonds. The result of such a comparison is rather that the risk inherent in the Projects as perceived by the Claimants must have been significantly above the risk converted into a bond rate of 8%. The Claimants' experts seem to take advantage of this bond rating as it yields lower risks than the Venezuelan sovereign bond, at least for a certain period of time. However, such assumption is speculative, because oil-producing companies are exposed to risks that can easily develop at levels above the risks retained for sovereign bonds, as well as for average companies in the same country. The key point in this respect is that the risk rate inherent in a bond rate of 8% is certainly of interest, in light of the Circular's most extensive enumeration of all risks the lenders are facing, but it is equally certain that an investor's risk burden must be heavier because it applies directly and without the safeguards available to the lenders through the protections available on the financial market, in particular the guarantees provided by the bond sponsors. The Claimants' experts did not ignore that this makes a difference and invalidates comparisons relevant to an assessment of the credit quality of unsecured debt691. At no point did they mention that in the circumstances of the instant case, the risk factor is not impacting the value of the bonds but the prospect of being paid the dividends arising from the Projects' performance. The discount rate made on this basis would result in different and higher proportions. Yet, this is not the approach that they choose:\n\n\"We considered three alternative approaches to calculate the project-specific exposures to country risk as suggested by Prof. Damodaran.... none of these approaches produces a meaningful result for the Projects, so we proceeded to our own implementation based on the observed Projects' debt performance.\"692\n\nOr, as the Claimants say in their 2017 Post-Hearing Brief: \"The yield on the Petrozuata bonds reflected the market's perception of the risk of an investment in the Petrozuata Project itself.\" (para. 214).\n\nConsolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 436.\n\nDamages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2014, footnote 120.\n\nReport on the Project-Specific Country Risk Applicable to the Claimants' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2017, footnote 66. The Tribunal observes that this footnote is attached to paragraph 47, opened by this statement: \"In assessing the level of country risk relevant to the Projects, we follow the approach put forward by Prof. Damodaran (2003), termed the \"Lambda Approach,\" which posits that the measurement of country risk must be asset-specific.\"\n\n916.\n\nIt seems to be simple to understand that a debt performance guaranteed by the sponsors and the shareholders of the parent companies has a lower risk component than the payment of dividends that comes in the stream of revenue after the payment of interest to the lenders.\n\n917.\n\nAs neither the sovereign bond nor the Petrozuata bond are useful indicators for the Projects' cost exposure and discount rate, the debate between the experts on whether one bond is rated above the other, or the reverse, is moot.\n\n918.\n\nThe Claimants' experts further submit that for the companies involved in the Projects, the effective cost of debt is not the interest paid to the lenders, but the net rate obtained when the income tax is deducted. Considering the effect of a reduction on an income tax of 50%, this cuts the risk component approximately by half693. Here again, such calculation does not include consideration of the higher risk component for investors, compared to lenders, and the methodology is further biased by a debt to equity ratio of 26% that is based on averages retrieved from E&P companies indexes unrelated to Venezuela694.\n\nCf. Preliminary Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 12 September 2008, Appendix E, paras. 37-47.\n\n*Ibidem*, Appendix E, paras. 35, 50.\n\ng. Consideration of a willing buyer\n-----------------------------------\n\n919.\n\nThe Claimants' experts, when introducing the DCF methodology as the most reliable tool to determine the Claimants' losses, use the comparison of a \"willing buyer\" who would consider purchasing the Project at the time of valuation695. They also refer to the World Bank Guidelines696. However, these Guidelines refer to the market value used for the calculation of just compensation at the time of expropriation. At the point of valuation of the three Projects in the instant case -whether it is the end of 2016 or 2018 - there is no willing buyer to consider. Such buyer may have its own views about weighing risks and profits inherent in the Projects compared to his own interests and the offers of other competing buyers. Each of those potential buyers will adopt his own debt-to-equity ratio. In this case, what matters is the valuation of future revenues attributable to the Claimants under the conditions of their experience in a but-for scenario. These conditions are predetermined by the Projects' inherent parameters. They cannot be moved for the purpose of complying with an incoming buyer's operational and financing choices.\n\n*Ibidem*, Appendix E, para. 62.\n\nLECG-037.\n\n920.\n\nMore particularly, when looking at the WACC at the basis of the Claimants' experts' conclusions, reference is made to \"the weighted average of the cost of debt and the cost of equity, with the weightings (which sum to 100%) determined by the optimal capital structure in the industry\"697. However, this definition is given in the abstract, and its elements are determined through parameters used by the \"industry\" and its pertinent market field. Such definition might be useful for an evaluation by a prospective buyer and allow him to compare with other projects interesting in view of an investment. For the purposes of valuation of an on-going project and its forthcoming cashflows, these factors must be determined by reference to the projects under consideration.\n\nPreliminary Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 12 September 2008, para. 69.\n\nh. Cost of debt\n---------------\n\n921.\n\nThe Claimants' experts submit that their WACC was based on cost of equity. However, they accept a more than 25% proportion of cost of debt as it is retained in U.S. business-oriented market manuals, with the effect of reducing significantly country risk for Venezuela down to about 4%. The experts' debt-to-equity ratio underwent changes. While the equity portion was initially set at 27%698, for August 2014, the debt to equity ratio was given as 29% to 71%699. This was shortly after the May 2014 report, where the debt-to-equity ratio was 40.7% as of March of the same year, and by reference to U.S. E&P industry700. In March 2016, the debt to equity ratio was said to have changed from 41% to 30%, without explanation701. The Consolidated Report noted that the \"debt-to-firm\" ratio became 25.6% in December 2016702. Finally, it was set at 26% for the same date703. In light of the confusing curb of the relevant ratio provided by the experts over the years, and the U.S. sourced information used as evidentiary support, the Tribunal notes that no effort has been provided to extract the pertinent percentages, if any, from the Projects' economic and financial structure itself704. The matter is relevant here because of the implications on the country risk factor. This factor is considerably higher in relation to cost of equity than in respect of cost of debt705. Therefore, when increasing the cost of debt portion, the country risk component decreases and so does the discount rate.\n\n*Ibidem*, Appendix E, para. 50.\n\nDamages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, Supplemental Report, 13 October 2014, para. 163.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 114/115. The same report presents the debt to equity ratio for the Projects' \"Base Case\" as 29% to 71% (para. 129).\n\nMarch 2016 Update, 18 March 2016, para. 26.\n\nCf. Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, footnote 95, where it is explained that the ratio provided results as an average from the capital structure of E&P Projects, referenced back to the sample of companies in Bloombergs' SIC Code 1311. No analysis is provided on the reasons why and, if so, to what extent these sources are relevant for the Projects at issue in the instant case. In Table 3, para. 95, the percentage noted is 25.9%.\n\nReport on the Project-Specific Country Risk Applicable to the Claimants' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2017, para. 63(c).\n\nIn its closing statement at the 2017 September Hearing, Counsel for the Claimants simply stated that the cost of equity was more than two times the cost of debt, and that a company was funded by debt and equity; TR-E, Day 18, p. 5167:19-5168:3 (Friedman).\n\n\"If things go wrong, the debtholder gets paid first. The equity holder, if there is any money left, gets paid last. So, that's why the Rate of Return that the investor would require the Hurdle Rate for, the investor would be substantially higher\"; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 14, p. 4167:12-17 (Flores). \"In general, equity is riskier than debt.\"; *ibidem*, p. 4236:21 (Spiller).\n\n922.\n\nThe Respondent's experts' position is ambiguous. Without close examination, the experts simply mentioned \"that the Projects have some debt\"706, whereas they had noted in August 2014 that there remained no debt-related expenses after 15 May 2014707. Nonetheless, the experts included consideration for cost of debt in their discount rate valuation708 and they retained a debt to asset ratio of 23.7%, referring to the Standard Industrial Classification Code prepared by the U.S. administration (SIC 2911, BF-62)709. Assuming no debt any longer in mid 2014 seems incompatible with the hypothesis of a debt portion of the Projects of more than 20%.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 424.\n\nExpert Report on Valuation, 18 August 2014, footnote 57.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras 282-284.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, pages 275 (Table 34) and 342 (Table B.2). The ratio was set at 3.3% only in June 2007 (pages 274, Table 33, and 340, Table B.1).\n\n923.\n\nThe Claimants' experts are more explicit. They included cost of debt \"by comparing the Projects' cost of debt with the cost of debt of comparable U.S. E&P producers\" and this \"absent the threat of expropriation\"710. The experts explained that they took that measure - the debt country risk - and amplified it by the relative risk of E&P companies' equity to their debt, to reflect the increased riskiness of equity investments in the industry, as compared to investments in debt711. Such analysis completely moves away from considering the Projects' own risk components, even to the extent it would be related to its cost of debt. Indeed, when adjusting the country risk based on debt yields, the experts say that they \"increase the debt country risk premium by capturing the US industry risk differential as applicable to general equity and debt investors\"712. In addition, cost of debt includes the risk component as perceived by the bond holders, with the effect that there is no further risk determination based on the Projects713. The experts were aware of the Projects' financing at least to the effect that the Hamaca and Corocoro Projects had not issued bonds and that the Petrozuata bonds had been paid back long before the valuation date in December 2016. This would have provided good reasons to examine more closely whether the debt ratio of 26% was reasonable and a good cause for the downgrading of the country risk by about one third compared to the country risk adopted in relation to cost of equity.\n\nOne may recall that the experts had later accepted that the Projects were protected by the BIT against expropriation; Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, Supplemental Report, 13 October 2014, para. 86(d).\n\nDamages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2014, para. 62; Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 87. As explained at the 2017 March Hearing, the experts proceeded as follows: \"But, if we agree that the Shareholders are more risky than debt, and if on average it's two - it's twice more risky, which is what we find, then I take the risk to the debt and multiply it by 2.2, and I get the risk to the Shareholders.\" TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 14, p. 4239:1-6 (Spiller).\n\nConsolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 92.\n\nReport on the Project-Specific Country Risk Applicable to the Claimants' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2017, paras. 39-41, 50(b).\n\n924.\n\nThere is more. The Claimants' experts knew that the Petrozuata bond was the only debt they could take into consideration. They noted, indeed, that \"[b]ecause the financial debt of the Projects was cancelled immediately after expropriation, there have been no direct observations of the Projects' cost of debt since mid-2007\", and further: \"If the Projects had outstanding debt as of 2016, however, one would still have to assess to what extent the yields on the bonds would be representative of a but-for scenario\". The experts then concluded: \"Because the Hamaca loan facilities did not represent traded market assets, we relied on an analysis of Petrozuata's bond for our country risk measurement for the Projects\".714 Thus, there was no debt to look at other than the Petrozuata bond and this in the abstract only, as the bond had been paid back and was no longer on the market. The credit rating up to December 2016 was indeed derived from the rating for the years 2002 to 2005 (further extended to 2007) on the basis of ratings concerning ten E&P companies operating in emerging markets, reported by credit agencies, and entirely unrelated to Venezuela715. It was then concluded that the bonds carried an average yield of 6.06% that the experts included in their calculation of the WACC, where it applied to the total debt exposure of 26% that the experts assumed based on U.S. market references for investors, while accepting that such exposure did not exist at the Projects under valuation716. This also means that the credit risk that the experts assume was included in the debt rate has no relation to either Venezuela or the Projects. Two errors must be mentioned here. First, ConocoPhillips Composite Economic Model of late 2006 (CEM, LECG-085) shows that the exposure for financing of the Projects compared to the total revenue after tax amounted to no more than 6%717 (a number far below the Claimants' experts' debt portion of 26%), the bottom level of zero US$ being reached for Petrozuata in year 2023 and for Hamaca in 2018, while no financing was noted for Corocoro. Second, the risk component of the debt based on the bonds was not borne by the lenders alone. These bonds were accompanied by guarantees provided by sponsors and the shareholders' parent companies; through their involvement and the fees they had to pay to the banks operating as intermediary, these companies serving as back-up were equally covering part of the Projects' risk. This means that the cost of debt (anyhow small and later disappearing completely) must be treated like cost of equity in respect of this involvement of the Projects' holders. This renders the cost of debt portion highlighted by the Claimants' experts insignificant. This also means that the WACC cannot serve its purpose, which is to determine average cost of capital when more than one source of financing is involved.\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 53, including footnote 75.\n\nCf. *ibidem*, paras. 55-58.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 58, 63(b).\n\nLECG-085, page 12/pdf.\n\ni. The Projects' inherent discount rate\n---------------------------------------\n\n925.\n\nWhen considering more closely the Projects, the Tribunal observes that in this respect as well, the Parties are inclined to proceed by comparison to other projects and decisions, rather than by addressing the relevant conditions of the Projects directly. The Respondent submits that the awards of other tribunals in cases involving the very same nationalization as the one at issue here should be looked at. This is correct, but not precise enough. The fact that the same nationalization took place does not mean, without further examination, that the conclusions reached in respect of another project must be the same as those pertinent for the Projects at issue in the instant case, which are based on different operational and economic parameters, conducted by different foreign investors, and which have to be valued at a different point in time. Any comparison to be conclusive should operate by analogy, which requires that the situations to be exposed one against the other are comparable, because they are based on the same or similar key-components and characteristics. Most discount analysis disregard this basic requirement, taking large numbers of companies into a sample that offers averages, but not analogies to the company at issue in the particular case. The experts on both sides were not successful in their approach based on comparisons of different kind but never involving the characteristics of the Projects in the instant case.\n\n926.\n\nThe Respondent insists on putting at the forefront as a comparative reference the *Mobil* cases discount rate of 18%. It referred to these decisions with so much emphasis that it gave the impression that it would be satisfied with such rate despite its experts' assertion that the proper rate should be 27.7%. In any event, while acknowledging that some assistance may be provided when considering the results reached in the *Mobil* decisions, this Tribunal must reach its own conclusion with its own reasons and it cannot therefore adopt the *Mobil* rate without examining the *Mobil* arbitrators' reasoning. In this respect, the result is not enlightening. The ICC *Mobil* Tribunal favored the respondent's assessment of the discount rate because it was left with no alternative, having rejected the claimant's position that was understood as submitting that no industry or country risk premium should apply718. More basically, the ICC Tribunal took as the main point of comparison the historical rate of return of the parent company's shareholders, which is in most cases, like the IRR, above the discount rate719. The ICSID *Mobil* Tribunal720, ruling three years later, did not add to the ICC Award's analysis. The Tribunal noted that while the claimants had excluded the confiscation risk when determining the discount risk, it was unable to adopt their experts' approach. The Tribunal did not consider that other elements of the experts' reasoning could be of assis-tance721. It then noted that the Respondent's experts arrived at discount rates ranging from 18.5% to 23.9%, which represents a margin also retained by other arbitral tribunals. Thus, concluded the Tribunal, an 18% discount rate appropriately reflects the existing risks in the present case722. In the instant case, in view of the extensive presentations made by the Parties and their experts, the Tribunal must find additional support for its conclusions. Little inspiration can be taken from discount rates retained by other arbitral awards relating to investments in Venezuela, adopting discount rates and their country risk portion offering variations between 10.09% (4%)723, 14.9% (7.9%)724, 18% (8.89%)725, 19.88% (10.26%)726, 21.25% (14.75%)727, and 23% (6%)728. One may think that such divergence simply demonstrates inconsistencies in the arbitral tribunals' work. While this may be true up to a point, another and more convincing conclusion is that the disparity in rates demonstrates a disparity in the businesses involved and the need to derive discount rates based on the characteristics of each particular investment involved in each case.\n\n*Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v.

These latter rates express the estimated rate of return to obtain the profit the investor expects. Such expectation is influenced by the investor's understanding of the revenue it hopes to earn from the project. The information on the Tribunal's record shows that the expected profit return was estimated at about 20%. The hurdle rate, which is calculated by using techniques similar to those of discount rates, is again different, in the sense that it also reflects the investor's expectations, but does so in respect of his bottom level or minimum acceptable return, indicating the line where the decision to invest or not to invest reaches its crucial check point. Hurdle rates depend on the available capital budget and the overall business and expectations of risk bearing of the investing com-pany729. The hurdle rate is therefore focused on the interests of the investor at the time he is investing and debating whether he should, or should not, jump over the \"hurdle\". A project's discount rate results from the economics of the project.\n\nCf. Abdala/Spiller, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 188.\n\n928.\n\nThe Claimants observe quite rightly that, as the internal rate of return, the discount rate may change over time. It may have been higher at the beginning of the Projects than at the time of expropriation, and it may have further decreased since then. However, in order to demonstrate that such evolution has taken place, the evidence should be presented that the inherent value of the Projects has changed over time and that the prevailing rate shows some stability over the future until the end of the Projects. Such a study has not been made. Additionally, whereas some factors of risks disappeared after a certain time, such as the uncertainty about the available EHCO in the early years of the Projects (mentioned by the Claimants), other risks appeared at a later stage, such as the growing uncertainty about the available reserves in the later years of the Projects, the instability of oil prices and the risks enumerated in various documents mentioned above.\n\n929.\n\nThe perception of the Claimants' experts' analysis and conclusions is impacted by the understanding they had, at least at certain points in time, about the claims the Claimants brought before this Tribunal. Thus, in their third report, the Claimants' claim was, in their experts' understanding, twofold, comprising: (a) the Respondent's expropriation of Claimants' interests in the Projects, and (b) the prior changes to the Projects' fiscal regimes, implemented by the Respondent before 26 June 2007730. As the second claim is not before this Tribunal, the risk assumption should have been modified.\n\nRebuttal Report to Respondent's Experts' Second Reports, 15 April 2010, para. 1.\n\n930.\n\nThe Claimants' experts had determined a country risk premium of 4.37% in their Preliminary Report of 2008731, which then moved up to 4.55% in May 2014732, and to 4.8% in October 2014733, before decreasing to 4.1% in December 2016734 and increasing to 4.2% in May 2017735. The experts do not explain in a clear and convincing manner why their country risk conclusion leads to these different figures.\n\nPreliminary Valuation Report of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 12 September 2008, para. 18.\n\nDamages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2014, paras. 4, 64, 67.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 81, 100.\n\nConsolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, footnote 111.\n\nReport on the Project-Specific Country Risk Applicable to the Claimants' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2017, para. 66.\n\n931.\n\nWhereas they do not address directly the country risk premium as related to the Projects, the Claimants' experts indirectly explain that the difference that appears between their own and the Respondent's experts' county risk formula is based, *inter alia,* on their difference in respect of the cost of debt, which is 6.1% for them, but 10.8% for the experts of the opposing Party736. This position raises considerable doubt when observing that neither these experts nor the experts of the Respondent offer evidence of any debt portion of the Projects, at least in recent years.\n\nDamages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, Supplemental Report, 13 October 2014, para. 82.\n\n932.\n\nThe Claimants' experts accept that general country risk cannot be retained alone. Projectspecific country risk has to be considered. Such risk is, by contrast, \"the incremental risk that an investor in a particular project faces as a result of the location of the asset\". Indeed, \"when assessing the market value of an asset it is necessary to focus on how the particularities of the project interact with the riskiness of the jurisdiction where the project is located. In other words, the project-specific country risk is the relevant measure of country risk when calculating the fair market value of an asset\".737 While here the project-specific risk appears somehow intermingled with the country risk, there is evidence that both have to be separated: \"In any case you need to analyze the projectspecific risk and not the country risk in general.\"738\n\n*Ibidem*, para. 57; Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 82.\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 10, p. 2690:7/8 (Spiller).\n\n933.\n\nHowever, when the Claimants' experts, having stated this broad definition, identify such project-specific country risk, they do it in order to mitigate and reduce general country risk. Country risk attempts to capture incremental risks such as the additional volatility of domestic demand, the infrastructure of a developing country (exposing the projects to more supply risks than a company located in the U.S.), and Governmental actions and macroeconomic policy affecting businesses. However, say the experts, in the case at hand, the Projects' particular features limited their susceptibility to all sources of country risk, in particular because they produce a commodity (crude oil) traded worldwide and mostly exported from Venezuela, they are only partially exposed to supply-side sources of country risk, as most of the infrastructure used to operate the Projects is self-contained, and from a regulatory perspective, the Projects are protected against expropriation risks. In addition, the shareholder agreements provide additional protection to private investors against the imposition of arbitrary or discriminatory measures by Venezuela. In sum, the experts state, \"the Projects were structured in a manner that minimized exposure to Venezuelan country risk\"739.\n\nConsolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, paras., 169/170. See also Report on the Project-Specific Country Risk Applicable to the Claimants' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2017, paras. 48/49.\n\n934.\n\nThe Claimants' experts do not explain how this analysis is connected to the 4.55%, 4.8%, and later 4.2% of country risk they adopted740. In any event, it suffices to mention that while the compensation provision offer some protection to the investor, as the experts say, this is one facet of the compensation system only; the same provisions implicitly transfer to the Projects the host State's sovereign independence to take regulatory measures affecting the Projects' profitability (\"no stabilization clause\"), which is of course a risk inherent in the Projects' value. No negative factor increasing risks of the Projects is mentioned by the experts. The Petrozuata bonds are taken as reference, but the many risks enumerated in the bond circular, addressed to the bond holders, do not merit any mention or examination. As a contrast, the bond holders are told that in light of the fact that Venezuela's increased fiscal deficit and the deterioration in its overall macroeconomic situation, \"the Projects could be adversely affected due to other political risk factors, such as an increase in the risk of supply chain disruptions\"741. Nonetheless, the experts affirm that \"the Projects have limited exposure to country risk\"742. Thus, what were of serious concern for the bond holders is considered irrelevant for the equity holders, and these risks are not factored in their calculation when the WACC is determined. The taxation risk, represented in particular by the WPT, is not examined; it would have impacted the Projects but not the lenders.\n\nThe experts simply state, as a conclusion, that \"overall\", their \"assessment of the Projects' country risk exposure is reflected in a country risk premium of 4.55%\", no explanation being provided why such exposure leads to this percentage. Cf. Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2014, para. 64.\n\nReport on the Project-Specific Country Risk Applicable to the Claimants' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2017, para. 32.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 45, 49. See also Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2014, paras. 58/59; Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, paras. 83/84.\n\n935.\n\nIt was only during the 2017 February and March hearings that the Claimants' experts acknowledged that the ConocoPhillips Composite Economic Model of late 2006 (CEM, LECG-085) set the Projects' discount rate at 13%. The experts had never mentioned this information before although they used the same Model extensively for their assessment of production and costs of the Projects. The experts argued that such rate had only been retained at the \"time of the initial investment\" and this may not be indicative of the risks that are relevant for a valuation at a more current date, such as December 2016743. Two remarks reduce the pertinence of this observation. The initial investments were to be examined before the years 1995 to 1997 when the Association Agreements were concluded, which means about 10 years before the Model was made. The assumption that discount rates were higher in the first years of operation of the Projects is incorrect in light of the difficulties and uncertainties appearing in 1999 as a result of the change of government and later at the end of 2001 when President Ch\u00e1vez obtained the legislative power by delegation for the purpose of changing the Law of Hydrocarbons. When the Composite Economic Model was set up, the economic situation was already far different from what the experts describe as the initial time for investment. Irrespective of the comments made by the experts, the fact is that the Projects' management at the relevant time retained a discount rate of 13% that cannot simply be qualified as irrelevant because of the circumstances prevailing at the time and on which the experts have based on the Composite Economic Model the assessments of other relevant characteristics of the Projects, such as the estimations on the costs of production. It may also be noted that the discount rate of 13% was not only mentioned in the Model at the time it was adopted, as the experts say. The same rate was included in the Model throughout the duration of the Projects, and this must have been well known to all participants744.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 5/6. In this last report, the experts note a number of other discount rates and sensitivities resulting from the Projects' documents, which they had never addressed before. At the 2017 March Hearing, when the matter was raised, the experts acknowledged that they had not looked at the CEM's discount rate before, and that one would first have to know whether reference was made to cost of equity or to a WACC; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 13, p. 3979:8-3980:17 (Abdala/Spiller). This distinction relates to the presence of cost of debt that one would expect the experts to know. The answer seems rather to show an escape for not having searched for a truly specific project rate.\n\nAn exchange of views at the 2017 March Hearing allows to understand that an internal ConocoPhillips presentation from October 2006 (C-474, p. 18/pdf) calculated Net Present Value on the basis of a discount rate of 13%; cf. Day 15, p. 4502:14-4504:14 (Kahale). The same rate was mentioned in a report to the Phillips' Management Committee, dated 17 July 1999 (LECG-65, p. 2), in a Note to the Phillips' Board of Directors, dated 5 May 1997 (LECG-114), and in a presentation of the Corocoro Project of 8 August 2005 (LECG-225, p. 8, 29).\n\n936.\n\nThis 13% rate must be looked at more closely. There is evidence from the Claimants that this rate represented a standard rate with little significance for the Projects745. However, this discount rate - and no other is used for comparison purposes - has been used to determine the Net Present Value (NPV) of the Projects and of ConocoPhillips' share; this results from the comparison of the Control Panel on the \"COP Venezuela LRP Model\" and the rubric on Economic Measures for each of the Projects746. Therefore, the 13% discount rate was a component of the Projects' economic valuation and has to be taken into account in the analysis of the value of the Projects' capital. All participants in the Projects, including the ConocoPhillips companies, have referred to this valuation. Therefore, it must be retained in a but-for scenario for which the Claimants rely heavily on the CEM.\n\nWitness Statement of Jeff. W. Sheets, 30 October 2009, para. 20, affirming that the \"discount rate of 13% is simply an approximate, hurdle rate used in an economic model built up for ConocoPhillips' internal screening of projects\", and that he \"would never use the flat 13% discount rate in the CEM to determine the fair market value of a particular asset\". The Witness further stated that ConocoPhillips usually transacted developed projects at discount rates of 10% or lower; Second Witness Statement dated 14 May 2014, para. 6. This notwithstanding, the fact is that the 13% was used in the CEM and this in connection with the determination of the Net Profit Value of a Project that had been transacted about 10 years earlier. At the 2010 Hearing, the Witness told the Tribunal that ConocoPhillips did not have a standard risk factor; Day 6, p. 1638:4-6. He added that 13% was used as a standard metrics that allows comparisons between different ConocoPhillips projects and it had to be understood in nominal terms; *ibidem*, p. 1640:2-1641:2. The Respondent's experts also insisted on the fact that this rate was \"standard\"; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 14, p. 4137:17-4140:11 (Brailovsky/Flores). There was no evidence other than what had been said by Witness Sheets, and in particular no evidence demonstrating why a discount rate should be less reliable simply because it was \"standard\". Counsel of the Respondent also insisted on the discount rate being a standard rate, adding that then ConocoPhillips did \"adjust based on the Net Present Value\"; TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 15, p. 4501:9-4502:10 (Kahale). This does not focus on the fact that in the CEM, the discount rate of 13% was used to determine the Net Present Value.\n\nCf. LECG-085, pages (pdf) 10/11, 75 (Petrozuata), 125, 156 (Corocoro I), 14, 272 (Hamaca).\n\n937.\n\nThe Claimants' experts accept that for an investment in debt, such as the Petrozuata bonds, the effective interest rate is a function of all risks associated with that investment at a particular point in time, as perceived by the debt holders747. The interest rate of approximately 8% set by the lenders in 1997 represented all risks that were listed in the Circular. The Tribunal finds that the premium that was offered could have retained its value in later years, in view of the political risks as well as the Governments' regulatory and taxation measures derived from its sovereign power expressly reserved since the Projects' early days. However, the Claimants' experts reduce such premium to a minimal rate without taking account of the Projects' ongoing uncertainties in respect of the economic and financial future.\n\nReport on the Project-Specific Country Risk Applicable to the Claimants' Investments in Venezuela, 19 May 2017, para. 11.\n\n938.\n\nThe experts accept that the Petrozuata Offering Circular is a valuable source of information to prospective investors; however, those investors will usually perform their own assessment of the risks they perceive as relevant at the point in time when they decide to invest, irrespective of whether those risks are mentioned explicitly in the initial offering documents. Moreover, the bond rate does not include consideration of the share of risks borne by the bond sponsors and the shareholders of the parent companies who are investors in the Projects but not investors in the bonds. Contrary to what the experts conclude, the Circular does not provide the proper measure of the overall risk of the asset, as assessed by equity investors in the Projects. When entering in the Projects in the 1990s, the Claimants accepted to run a risk of a dimension that has little elements of comparison to risks that later emerged as a counterpart of an investment in industry bonds for the same type of business.\n\n939.\n\nTherefore, the Projects' inherent discount rate of 13% must prevail over the bond rate of 8% that is tied to the lenders' interests that comprise a smaller risk component and are protected by the sponsors and the shareholders' parent companies.\n\n940.\n\nThe Claimants' experts are right when they state that the compensation provisions offered an additional layer of protection748. They should also recognize, however, that this protection had the purpose of compensating, in part only, for discriminatory actions of the Government to which the investors were otherwise exposed to their detriment with no other additional protection than the BIT. Therefore, the damages suffered through such action had to count as risk factors to the extent they were not compensable through either PDVSA's compensation payments or through the measures of safeguard provided by the BIT.\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 15-17.\n\n941.\n\nThe Respondent's experts were aware of the 13% Composite Economic Model's (CEM) discount rate of 13%; they referred to it in 2009749 and 2010750. However, they chose not to discuss it further any more than the other rates used for comparison purposes in the CEM. They were given ample opportunity in the 2017 February and March hearings to reflect on the matter and were invited to provide reactions and answers. However, they decided to remain silent even in their Additional Report of May 2017 after the hearings. But whatever the reason for their silence, they did not object to the CEM 13% rate, they simply decided to ignore it.\n\nBrailovsky/Wells, Expert Report on the Discount Rate to be Applied to Projected Cashflows, 24 July 2009, para. 68.\n\nTR-E, 2010 Hearing, Day 12, p. 3325:22-3326:2 (Brailovsky).\n\n942.\n\nThe Claimants have referred to a number of documents reflecting in their view the Projects' own practices, revealing rates in a range between 8% and 12%, many of them using a rate of 10%751. However, they omitted to mention the 2006 CEM for the discount rate but took it as the basic document for the economic and financial structure of the Projects for other purposes.\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, paras. 399-401; Claimants' Memorial on Quantum, para. 185.\n\n943.\n\nThe Claimants' experts leave the Tribunal with little assistance. The characteristics of the discount rate they propose is that they are (a) representing averages and not guidelines to be directed to particular investment vehicles, and (b) in predominant part based on information collected on foreign markets by institutions that are well-known but predominantly oriented at market appraisals for new businesses rather than at the valuation of on-going investment operations.\n\n944.\n\nAs a first step in its conclusion, the Tribunal notes that in the Composite Economic Model (CEM) the Projects' discount rate of 13% was retained as the factor representing the risk component specific to the investment in which the Claimants engaged in the 1990s and would have conducted to the end of the Projects' life under a but-for scenario.\n\n945.\n\nHowever, there is a second step. When considering the 13% rate mentioned in the CEM, the Tribunal notes that such rate cannot serve as the final criterion for discounting the dividends awarded in view of the future years. Indeed, when the Tribunal found the respective amounts, it did so after a detailed analysis of production and costs of each of the three Projects. This examination was based on all of the elements of evidence on the Tribunal's record, based on a prudent and realistic assessment. Compared to the Model the Parties use as prepared towards the end of 2006 and still reliable in June 2007, the Tribunal's assessment is different. The Model was based on business estimations that were certainly prepared seriously, with a high degree of professionalism, but they may also have received an input of optimism that may have resulted in envisaging a better future for the Projects than what it became in reality. As mentioned earlier it may suffice to note the cliff on productivity at the end of year 2023 that affected the Petrozuata Project that was not recorded in the early Model of 2006, and the difficulties the Hamaca upgrader was facing. The Tribunal has thus incorporated in its assessment risks that resulted from the evidence and events in the historical period that have not been included in the valuation on which the Model was based. As explained earlier in respect of interest and update factor, a similar comparison is to be made in respect of the profitability of the Projects, when comparing the data retained in the CEM with the values retained in this Award.\n\n946.\n\nIf the Tribunal were to retain the project related risk component of 13%, as mentioned in the Model, without adjusting it as a result of its findings, it would result in double counting. This is because the Tribunal's assessment of the Claimants' revenue already includes a portion of such risk that resulted in reduced figures on production and higher amounts of costs, compared to the corresponding amounts provided for in the Model. That portion of risk was included in the Model's 13% rate and has already been substantiated in the revenue determined by the Tribunal as the basis for the calculation of the dividends. These risks cannot be counted twice. The project-related risks that remain as part of the discount rate for purposes of this Award can only be unsubstantiated risks, such as all the risks mentioned in the Circular, excluding those that were identified by the Tribunal when it proceeded with its estimate of production and costs. In sum, when referring to the 13% discount rate used in the CEM, the pertinence of such rate must be evaluated in light of a comparison between the assessment on production and costs as retained in the Model, and the corresponding figures retained for the purposes of this Award. These differences are either based on reductions in respect of year-by-year production (mostly due, for instance for Hamaca, in the operation of the upgrader) or related to the shortening of the period of operation until its end, or on cost items consequential to risks that materialized already in the consideration of a but-for scenario. The Tribunal measures the overall impact of such substantiated risks at 25%. Therefore, if the CEM discount rate is taken as the reference, such impact leads to a reduction of the project related discount rate from 13% to 9.75%.\n\n947.\n\nHowever, the Parties' submissions and their experts' views on respect of the pertinence of the CEM's 13% discount rate is less than satisfactory. The Model calculates the Projects' Net Present Value (NPV) by applying a discount rate of 13% to the dividends that were expected to accrue to the ConocoPhillips' B Shareholders, year by year, over the whole duration of the Projects (35 years for Petrozuata and Hamaca). While the Model is clear in that the calculations were based on the option to apply the 13% discount rate, the Parties failed to explain clearly the reasons why this rate was retained rather than any other one among the range of rates listed in the Model between 0% and 16%. As explained above, the Parties and their experts did not explain why the option for 13% was taken. This is striking in light of both Parties' insistence on the relevance of other of the CEM's components as important elements of the evidence before this Tribunal. It has been said by the Claimants that this rate was a \"standard rate\". However, nothing can be derived from the term \"standard\" in this matter, because a discount rate fixed for determining the value of money earned in the future implies necessarily a measure of average and thus of a \"standard\" to be applied at the same level during all the relevant years.\n\n948.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that no explanation has been provided in reference of the main components of a discount rate specifically set at 13%. As noted above, this rate was used for calculating the Net Present Value of the Projects in light of the assumed profits represented by the Projects' dividends. Such method of calculation and the corresponding rate must have been based on a choice of policy made by those who operated the Projects in the years 2006/2007. The Parties concentrated their efforts to reduce (Claimants) or increase (Respondent) the discount rate based on hypothesis such as assuming that the Petrozuata Bonds were to maintain a given rating throughout several years or that the Projects' discount rate would be somehow tied to the rate of the Venezuela sovereign bonds. They even mentioned discount rates used by each other in other projects and in completely different scenarios but failed to refer and sustain the discount rate that they have agreed to include in the CEM. The Parties did not consider or explain whether the 13% rate was assessed on the exclusive basis of the Project's economics, including production, costs, cash-flows up to the resulting dividends. They have speculated on what would be the costs of capital of ConocoPhillips as the foreign investor without indicating which costs of capital, if any, and on which basis, were included to determine the 13% rate included in the Model. Nonetheless, the Tribunal has evidence on the record of the fact that it had been decided at the time when the CEM was prepared and agreed upon that the discount rate of 13% was the most suitable option to determine the Net Present Value of the Projects. More information and cooperation from the Parties would have been useful, however, even if based on a comparative analysis.\n\n949.\n\nThe Tribunal finds additional support for its assessment in the set of documents originating in the earlier period of the setting up of the Projects in the years 1990s and in the references to discount rates made by the Parties during this arbitration. In the 1990s, the margin for possible discount rates was set between 8% and 12%, with a clearly prevailing focus put on the middle number of 10%. The Petrozuata Descriptive Report dated October 1996 used a discount rate of 10%752. For the Hamaca Phase II, the same rate served as the basic assumption in the years 1998 and 1999753; it was also applied in an Information Memorandum sponsored by the participants in the Project in August 2000754. The working draft of a Hamaca Economic Model dated 30 October 2006 was based on a 10% discount rate755. Witness Sheets also stated that ConocoPhillips usually transacted developed projects at discount rates of 10% or lower756. On the other hand, consolidated financial statements concerning PDVSA also refer to a discount rate of 10%757. The same rate had been retained in the Treaty concluded between Venezuela and China on 17 April 2010758.\n\nJoint Venture Project Maraven-Conoco, Petrozuata C.A., Descriptive Report, p. 22-24 (C-92).\n\nCf. the Business Plans dated 14 October 1998, p. 233 (LECG-002) and 30 April 1999, p. 7, 25, 28, 48 (C-73/461).\n\nHamaca Confidential Preliminary Information Memorandum prepared by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Volume I, p. XII-1 (C-101).\n\nLECG-129, p. 253/pdf.\n\nSecond Witness Statement dated 14 May 2014, para. 6.\n\nPetrozuata Offering Circular dated 17 June 1997, Annex G, p. G-45, p. 336/pdf (C-75).The 10% rate is also mentioned in the PDVSA Consolidated Financial Statements for years 2008 to 2010 (p. 88/pdf, C-593) and 2011 to 2013 (p. 106/pdf, C-616).\n\nArticle 6 (C-585).\n\n950.\n\nWhen compared to the discount rate of 13% on which the CEM is based, the rate of 10% as the prevailing figure in the years mainly prior to 2000 may be different in the sense that it has not, and could not at that time, reflect a detailed assessment, year by year, of all the pertinent figures for production, costs, oil prices, taxes, cash-flow and dividends, etc. Therefore, when the Tribunal reduces the 13% rate to 9.75%, it does so on the basis of its own assessment of the economics of the Projects as detailed and specific as this had been done for the CEM in 2006. However, the 10% discount option made in the years 1995 to 2000 and the references to the 10% rate in later years also reflect the expectations of the Parties. Even though the 10% option was based on the ConocoPhillips' long standing business experience, it is closer to the rate that was determined in the CEM than the Parties' exaggerated rates presented to the Tribunal.\n\n951.\n\nThus, the Tribunal finds much support in the evidence on its record for the most reasonable assessment of the discount rate to be used for the determination of the value of the future dividends at the time of the Award. Indeed, both assessments lead to a nearly identical result. Starting with the CEM 13% discount rate resulting from the calculations based exclusively on the dividends produced in the future, the Tribunal's assessment of the actual figures representing the economics of the Projects in a but-for scenario must have the effect of reducing this number down to 9.75%, thus not considering yet the investor's own cost of capital. On the other hand, the more historical but nevertheless firmly supported rate of 10% stays very close to the rate of 9.75% derived from the CEM and updated to present time. Both rates taken together offer a solid margin for the assessment of the applicable discount rate.\n\n952.\n\nBy reference to one or the other rate mentioned above, the component of the risk valuation must be completed by the cost of capital the investor collects on the market for the purpose of transferring the required assets into the investment operating in the future. Both Parties and their experts share the view that this component must be divided in a risk-free rate and in an industry risk related part. The Parties' experts disagree in respect of the appropriate rates, but neither one of them puts forward any convincing argument when focused on the present time. Thus, when the Respondent's experts base their study of the market risk premiums on statistics dating back to 1926759, the Tribunal does not feel that this is realistic for a present time assessment, where market rates for the oil production industry must be available worldwide. In view of the little effort made to bring numbers close when the difference is minimal and essentially based on statistics rather than on actual markets figures, the Tribunal will not proceed to examine highly hypothetical assessments which cannot possibly be converted into a legal perspective. As for the risk-free rate, the Tribunal adopts the Claimants' experts' choice to rely on a slightly more flexible 10-year U.S. Treasury Bonds instead of such Bonds having 20-year duration. The respective rate is 1.9%760. For the industry risk share, the Claimants' experts selected the beta factor corresponding to companies in the crude petroleum and natural gas industry, which is a sector close to the industry where the Projects belong, more than the midstream and downstream business that was the preference of the Respondent's experts. The rate thus to be retained is 5.5%761.\n\nCf. Brailovsky/Flores, Consolidated Update Report, 17 November 2016, para. 415, pages 339 (Table A.2), 342 (Table B.2).\n\nAbdala/Spiller, Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, paras. 76, 181(a), 166 (Figure 29).\n\n*Ibidem*, paras. 78/79, 181(b), 166 (Figure 29). The rate of 5.5% was also used by the experts in their presentation at the 2017 March Hearing (slide 29), while their WACC Model mentions a 6.12% market risk premium. The same table is presented in Claimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 411.\n\nj. Conclusion\n-------------\n\n953.\n\nWhen taking the above mentioned components of the cost of capital (1.9+5.5) and adding each of the above mentioned rates adopted on the basis of the assessment of the Projects' economics and cash flows, the resulting discount rate becomes 17.15%, and 17.40%. As explained above, the evidence before this Tribunal does not permit a definitive conclusion in favor of one or the other rate. In light of the uncertainties implied in such estimation, the Tribunal uses its margin of discretion and sets the discount rate to be retained in the instant case at 17.25%.\n\n954.\n\nThe calculations resulting from the explanations given above in both Sections XI and XII are therefore as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ConocoPhillips' Dividends together with Update (9.75%) and Discount (17.25%) |\n|  | Petrozuata | Hamaca | Corocoro |\n|  | CPZ Dividends |  | CPH Dividends |  | CPG Dividends |  |\n| 2007 \u00bd | 118,474,157 | 130,025,387 | 235,580,893 | 258,550,030 | *--* |  |\n| 2008 | 335,629,241 | 368,353,092 | 355,432,880 | 390,087,586 | 18,193,531 | 19,967,400 |\n| 2009 | 189,299,059 | 207,755,717 | 138,984,280 | 152,535,247 | 31,954,307 | 35,069,852 |\n| 2010 | 298,179,642 | 327,252,157 | 393,769,548 | 432,162,079 | 45,012,002 | 49,400,672 |\n| 2011 | 219,725,148 | 241,148,350 | 284,352,829 | 312,077,230 | 59,842,926 | 65,677,611 |\n| 2012 | 234,178,868 | 257,011,308 | 233,237,062 | 255,977,676 | 55,581,118 | 61,000,277 |\n| 2013 | 279,555,194 | 306,811,825 | 367,939,094 | 403,913,156 | 70,107,476 | 76,942,955 |\n| 2014 | 252,323,770 | 276,925,338 | 295,262,710 | 324,050,824 | 61,124,930 | 67,084,611 |\n| 2015 | - 30,903,574 | 0 | - 102,608,475 | 0 | - 8,723,311 | 0 |\n| 2016 | 89,600,242 | 98,336,266 | 82,425,743 | 90,462,253 | 21,194,635 | 23,261,117 |\n| 2017 | 137,570,161 | 150,983,252 | 140,159,351 | 153,824,888 | 27,916,042 | 30,637,856 |\n| 2018 | 176,517,019 | 193,728,428 | 212,588,134 | 233,315,477 | 31,342,280 | 34,398,152 |\n| 2019 | 176,481,586 | 150,517,344 | 230,021,830 | 196,180,665 | 27,815,802 | 23,723,499 |\n| 2020 | 207,274,313 | 150,766,885 | 248,723,021 | 180,915,785 | 27,490,559 | 19,996,042 |\n| 2021 | 207,640,958 | 128,817,518 | 268,772,004 | 166,742,356 | 25,469,509 | 15,800,924 |\n| 2022 | 227,505,626 | 120,379,716 | 262,159,475 | 138,716,056 | 23,412,655 | 12,388,304 |\n| 2023 | 259,208,925 | 116,971,536 | 262,914,546 | 118,643,748 | 21,101,923 | 9,522,528 |\n| 2024 | 186,634,186 | 71,832,109 | 293,269,618 | 112,874,151 | 18,336,517 | 7,057,392 |\n| 2025 | 155,259,237 | 50,964,823 | 282,585,489 | 92,760,468 | 17,249,883 | 5,662,383 |\n| 2026 | 133,939,127 | 37,498,006 | 285,971,160 | 80,061,357 | 16,249,946 | 4,549,384 |\n| 2027 |  |  | 263,094,231 | 62,819,472 |  |  |\n| 2028 |  |  | 277,875,702 | 56,588,067 |  |  |\n| 2029 |  |  | 299,985,774 | 52,102,560 |  |  |\n| 2030 |  |  | 329,726,845 | 48,842,633 |  |  |\n| 2031 |  |  | 339,807,516 | 42,930,466 |  |  |\n| 2032 |  |  | 339,629,131 | 36,595,206 |  |  |\n| 2033 |  |  | 363,614,258 | 33,415,514 |  |  |\n| 2034 |  |  | 360,877,626 | 28,284,827 |  |  |\n| 2035 |  |  | 350,003,448 | 23,396,734 |  |  |\n| 2036 |  |  | 337,798,446 | 19,258,639 |  |  |\n| Total | 3,854,092,885 | 3,386,079,057 | 8,033,954,168 | 4,498,085,150 | 590,672,730 | 562,140,959 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n\nk. Tax net Award\n----------------\n\n955.\n\nThe Claimants recall that their experts' valuations are net of all applicable taxes. Any subsequent taxation by Venezuela of the Award would thus result in the Claimants being taxed twice for the same income. As the tribunal in *ConocoPhillips v. PDVSA* recently confirmed, any additional taxes applying to the amount granted under the award would undermine the principle of full compensation of the damage incurred762. The Claimants request that the Tribunal declare in the Award that (a) the Award is net of all Venezuelan taxes; (b) Venezuela may not tax or attempt to tax the Award; and (c) the Claimants have no further taxation obligations to Venezuela in respect of the three Projects.\n\nCf. *Phillips B.V. v. Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited & ConocoPhillips Petrozuata Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.*, ICC 16849/JRF), Award dated 17 September 2012 (CL-255).\n\n956.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, with the Claimants, that the Respondent appears to agree, as it did not comment on or refute the Claimants' request.\n\n957.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully evaluated and applied to the assessment of costs and expenses of the Claimants' claims in a but-for scenario all applicable taxation measures. Therefore, applying the same or further taxes to the amount awarded would undermine the principle of full compensation, and, at least in part, double taxation. The Tribunal therefore grants the Claimants' request to declare the Award net of taxes.\n\n**XIII. Hamaca's Debt Repayment**\n---------------------------------\n\n958.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is undisputed that after the nationalization, PDVSA worked with the Claimants to relieve them of their debt obligations to the lenders in connection with the Hamaca Project, through a payment of US$ 298 million on behalf of ConocoPhillips. The Claimants' valuation taking into account the compensation provisions does not deduct this amount. If such deduction is made, the overall valuation as of 26 June 2007 results in the amount of US$ 1,134 billion.\n\n959.\n\nThe Claimants' answers to a question raised by the Tribunal in July 2017 are explicit in the sense that the Claimants accept that PDVSA had made debt service payments of US$ 298 million to Hamaca Project's lenders (R-119). The Claimants object strongly, however, to Venezuela's experts' suggestion that this payment was somehow linked to compensation for the expropriation763.\n\nCf. Claimants' Initial Replies to the Tribunal's Questions, 10 July 2017 - Claimants' Replies of 10 July 2017; Claimants' Supplemental Comments on the Tribunal's Questions, 31 July 2017 (Question 20).\n\n960.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the outstanding debt at the time is not disputed between the Parties, and it involves an obligation borne by ConocoPhillips to repay to the lenders an amount of US$ 298 million, from which it was relieved by the PDVSA's subsidiary. While it is not contested that ConocoPhillips kept an obligation to compensate the PDVSA subsidiary for such payment it is argued that ConocoPhillips might be over-compensated when it would be compensated for the loss of profit resulting from the expropriation and simultaneously relieved from its debt. However, the Tribunal finds that this debt repayment relates to transactions between ConocoPhillips and the PDVSA subsidiary (or its successor in law) in case it would claim reimbursement. If the amount of US$ 298 million would be deducted from the compensation the Respondent has the burden to pay, the benefit would be for the Venezuelan Government. This would not have the effect of reimbursing the PDVSA Company that had initially relieved ConocoPhillips from its obligation to repay the lenders. In any event, the Respondent does not request such payment to be made for the purpose of its own compensation, and it did not raise a counterclaim either. The suggestion was made by the Respondent's experts for calculation purposes and not in view of a legal assessment. Consequently, the Tribunal does not pursue the matter any further.\n\n**XIV. Avoidance of Double Recovery**\n-------------------------------------\n\n961.\n\nThe Claimants have declared on several occasions and in relation to the ICC Arbitration that they intend to comply with the principle that there should not be any double recovery (*see*, for the first time, Claimants' letter dated 10 October 2014). Such statement has been explained at two of the Tribunal's hearings764. In their Consolidated Brief of 30 December 2016, the Claimants have added that if they obtain payment from the relevant governmental actor through the other remedies expressly contemplated in the compensation provisions, they must provide an offset to the PDVSA subsidiaries through an appropriate credit or reimbursement (para. 87). The Tribunal is aware that a similar statement has been made on part of the claimants in the ICC arbitral proceeding765. In their cover letter dated 25 April 2018 sending the ICC Award dated 18 April 2018 to this Tribunal, the Claimants stated:\n\nThe Tribunal likewise does not need to be concerned with any risk of double recovery. The Claimants here, and in the ICC case, have formally and repeatedly undertaken to ensure that no double recovery will ensue. Furthermore, no issue of double recovery could even potentially arise until the ICC claimants actually obtain payment on the ICC Award. In the event that the ICC respondents do not honor that Award, enforcement proceedings will be necessary to obtain actual payment.\" (footnotes omitted)\n\nTo the Tribunal's knowledge, Respondent has not reacted, either in approving or in rejecting such statement766, which thus appears to be made unilaterally by the Claimants. When the Parties informed the Tribunal on 20 and 21 August 2018 about the settlement agreement in respect of the amounts awarded by the ICC Tribunal, they did not submit the content of this agreement. Therefore, the Tribunal is not aware whether the Claimants' undertaking has been repeated therein or provided with more indications as to its meaning.\n\nCf. TR-E, 2017 March Hearing, Day 15, p. 4309:21-4311:3, 4510:5-17, 4513:18-4514:17, 4528:20-4529:15; 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 5039:9-5065:5 (Partasides).\n\n*Phillips Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited, ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. v. Petr\u00f3les de Venezuela S.A.* et al., Final Award, ICC 20549/ASM/JPA, dated 24 April 2018, para. 1125.\n\nCounsel of the Respondent noted that he had not much positive to contribute to the discussion, except recalling that the issue had been raised in the *Mobil* case, where it was rendered moot because of the partial annulment of the Award. TR-E, 2017 September Hearing, Day 17, p. 5065:11-5066:16 (Kahale).\n\n962.\n\nThe Tribunal has raised with the Parties a number of questions as to the legal nature and effects of the undertaking made by the Claimants. The Tribunal is not, however, called to proceed with such examination any further and to draw conclusions having an effect on the resolution of the claims it is requested to make in its ruling.\n\n963.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants' undertaking implies to produce effect when double recovery might become an issue, *i.e.* in the enforcement stage of one or both awards in case they reach such stage and the issue cannot be resolved through cooperation between the Parties. Therefore, in this regard, this Tribunal is not called to do more than to acknowledge the Claimants' undertaking, possibly in providing some support for the Claimants and some relief to the Respondent, as otherwise the official and solemn submission of this undertaking would have had no meaning.\n\n964.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that meaning can be given at least in the form of recalling the legal principle that is at the very basis of the Claimants' declaration, which implicitly invokes a principle of international law that it shall not be permitted to seek double recovery and thus cause an illegal enrichment that the international legal order must condemn. The Claimants were manifestly acting in good faith and their position was as such appreciated by the Respondent. The fundamental legal basis is thus the principle of good faith and it is in this regard that the Claimants, albeit without saying it so precisely, wanted undoubtedly to express their intention not to seek double recovery as a consequence of the two arbitral proceedings that had been launched and that are awarding amounts based at least in part on the same subject matters, albeit not between the same parties.\n\n965.\n\nBoth Parties recognized the close connection of the Claimants' commitment to the claim before this Tribunal, which means that the matter is to a minimal extent within this Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Tribunal therefore endorses the Claimants' undertaking and will declare that the Claimants are under a duty of good faith not to seek double recovery when seeking enforcement, in full or in part, of the Award rendered by this ICSID Tribunal.\n\n**XV. Legal Fees and Costs**\n----------------------------\n\nA. The Claimants' Position\n--------------------------\n\n966.\n\nIn their submission dated 16 April 2018 and updated on 17 September 2018, the Claimants stated their costs incurred as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Category | Incurred Amount (US$) |\n|  |  |\n| Advances paid to ICSID |  |\n| Claimants' portion of advance on costs | 4,525,000.00 |\n| Respondent's portion of advance on costs (paid in substitution by the Claimants) | 1,400,000.00 |\n| *Total advances paid to ICSID* | 5,925,000.00 |\n|  |  |\n| Legal fees |  |\n| Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP | 36,777,972.00 |\n| Three Crowns LLP | 3,889,622.50 |\n| *Total legal fees* | 40,667,594.50 |\n|  |  |\n| Expert fees and expenses |  |\n| Compass Lexecon / LECG | 15,916,639.64 |\n| Moyes & Co. | 271,633.51 |\n| Muse Stancil | 492,587.87 |\n| Strickland Group | 1,670,711.84 |\n| *Total expert fees and expenses* | 18,351,572.86 |\n|  |  |\n| Disbursements and other charges |  |\n| Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP | 3,150,362.39 |\n| Three Crowns LLP | 133,772.75 |\n| Claimants' Travel & Expenses | 589,227.58 |\n| Document & Translation Services | 616,358.26 |\n| Other Vendors (trial graphics, etc.) | 301,357.23 |\n| *Total disbursements and other charges* | 4,791,078.21 |\n|  |  |\n| *Total costs claimed* | 69,735,245.57 |\n\n967.\n\nIn support of the reimbursement of these costs, the Claimants submit that they have been forced to incur substantial legal fees and costs in pursuing their right to reparation for Venezuela's unlawful expropriation over the course of nearly 10 years. Venezuela bears full responsibility for the costs the Claimants have incurred, and Venezuela must compensate the Claimants fully for them. Three principles support this conclusion.\n\n968.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal has the authority to award costs that follow the event, as a large and growing body of investment tribunals have done. The allocation of the costs of the arbitration between the parties, including ICSID's administrative charges, the Tribunal's fees and expenses, and the legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by the Parties is governed by Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention. There has been a marked and growing trend toward awarding costs to the prevailing party, as a function of its success in the case, as confirmed in *Libananco v. Turkey*767. Numerous other tribunals have reached the same conclusion, as in the cases *Gold Reserve*768 and *ADC*769. The Claimants are the prevailing party in this case. The Tribunal has already ruled for the Claimants on this arbitration's two largest questions: whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction under Article 9 of the BIT to hear the Claimants' claims and whether Venezuela breached Article 6 of the BIT. The Tribunal has also ruled for the Claimants on numerous applications, including: six motions to disqualify either their appointed arbitrator or the Tribunal President; a request for reconsideration of the Tribunal's 2013 Merits Decision; and a request for reconsideration of that reconsideration decision.\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Ltd. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award dated 2 September 2011 (R-451).\n\n*Gold Reserve Inc. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award dated 22 September 2014 (CL-328).\n\n*ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award of 2 October 2006 (CL-15).\n\n969.\n\nSecond, awarding full costs and fees to a prevailing claimant is required to achieve full reparation, thus following the principle of full reparation established in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory*. Had Venezuela complied with its obligations under the Treaty and international law, there would have been no need for this arbitration, and the substantial expenses associated therewith. Tribunals have recognized the complementarity of the \"full reparation\" principle with the practice of awarding costs to the prevailing party. These ICSID proceedings are of historic scale, now spanning over more than nine years, and involving no fewer than 11 major written submissions by the Claimants. Venezuela refused even to take the necessary initial step of negotiating compensation for the expropriation in good faith. Unless Venezuela compensates the Claimants for the arbitration expenses that they should not have had to incur, the Claimants will not be fully restored to their but-for position.\n\n970.\n\nThird, the Tribunal should consider Venezuela's dilatory and obstructionist tactics in assessing costs against it. Assessing all costs against the Respondent is further justified by Venezuela's deliberately wasteful, dilatory and abusive tactics in this proceeding. Prior ICSID costs award have taken into account the fact that a party has obstructed or prolonged the proceedings, including by raising unmeritorious arbitrator and jurisdictional challenges. Venezuela's attempts to postpone accountability for its unlawful conduct have been serial. Venezuela has not limited itself to challenging the Tribunal's members on no better ground than displeasure at the substance of their rulings; it has also consistently refused to accept the Tribunal's decisions. Venezuela's refusal to respect adverse results has demonstrated its disrespect not only of the Tribunal's authority, but also of its own solemn Treaty obligations. On the basis of these tactics alone, the Tribunal would be entirely justified to assess costs and fees against Venezuela in full.\n\n971.\n\nThe Claimants note that their costs were further increased by the Respondent's misconduct when Venezuela has chosen to disregard its financial obligations to ICSID and this Tribunal, forcing the Claimants to pay nearly US$ 1 million in substitution for the Respondent. This, too, is serious (and intentional) misconduct that should be given heavy weight in the overall allocation of costs.\n\n972.\n\nFor all the above reasons, the Claimants are entitled to full reimbursement of their arbitration costs and expenses, including legal and expert fees, to which shall be added post-award compound interest on these costs and expenses.\n\n973.\n\nOne particular element of full reparation in respect of legal fees and costs is expressed in Claimants' request that they should be granted pre-award compound interest, running from the time when the costs were incurred. Specifically, the Claimants' pre-award interest should be awarded on the sums and as of the dates of the following procedural key-events: (1) Merit phase: US$ 23,639,516.28 in legal fees and US$ 2,544,062.59 in related expenses with interest as from 7 September 2013; (2) first procedural interruption: US$ 1,616,075,62 and US$ 69,786.06 (5 May 2014); (3) written *quantum* phase: US$ 3,689,252.00 and US$ 220,465.55 (28 January 2015); (4) second procedural interruption: US$ 2,685,503.00 and US$ 65,493.37 (15 March 2016); (5) reconstituted *quantum* phase: US$ 9,037,247.60 and US$ 384,336.57 (date of the Award). The Claimants submit that pre-award interest should also be granted on the sum the Claimants paid to ICSID in substitution for the Respondent. In the alternative, the Claimants request that pre-award interest should at least be granted on legal fees and related expenses incurred during the first and second procedural interruptions, which represent the peak periods of the Respondent's procedural misconduct.\n\n974.\n\nIn their rebuttal letter dated 3 May 2018, the Claimants replied shortly to the Respondent's cost submission, affirming that the Respondent has no entitlement to recover any portion of its costs in circumstances where (i) it admits that it expropriated the Claimants' investment and that compensation is due, (ii) it never paid any compensation at all, and (iii) the Tribunal has found that expropriation to be unlawful. The Claimants also noted that it understood the Respondent making the concession that the procedural \"chaos\" after the first phase was engendered by its own \"misrepresentation\" allegations, which have been rejected by the Tribunal.\n\nB. The Respondent's Position\n----------------------------\n\n975.\n\nIn the submission contained in its letter dated 16 April 2018, the Respondent stated its costs incurred as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Category | Hours | Amount Billed (US$) |\n|  |  |  |\n| Attorneys & Paralegals |  |  |\n| Partners | 29,099.67 | 19,733,379 |\n| Counsel | 4,289.40 | 2,253,966 |\n| Associates | 50,871.37 | 17,565,381 |\n| Paralegals | 17,584.23 | 3,536,621 |\n| *Total Attorneys & Paralegals* | 101,844.67 | 43,089,347 |\n|  |  |  |\n| Experts |  |  |\n| Econ One Research (Economic Experts: Jeffrey Leitzinger, Anthony Finizza, Joseph Wilkinson, Daniel Flores and Support Staff) |  | 5,213,757 |\n| Vladimir Brailovsky (Economic Expert) |  | 1,670,080 |\n| Louis T. Wells (Economic Expert) |  | 816,917 |\n| Jes\u00fas Rafael Pati\u00f1o Murillo (Technical Expert) |  | 300,798 |\n| Rafael Sandrea (Technical Expert) |  | 366,243 |\n| John Kirtley (Technical Expert) |  | 272,562 |\n| M. Sornarajah (International Law Expert) |  | 125,000 |\n| Enrique Urdaneta Fontiveros (Venezuelan Law Expert) |  | 385,960 |\n| Gary Gartner (Tax Expert) |  | 359,450 |\n| *Total Experts* |  | 9,510,767 |\n|  |  |  |\n| Expenses & Arbitration Costs |  |  |\n| Expenses (Travel, translations, and other expenses) |  | 2,381,199 |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses and ICSID administrative costs |  | 3,125,000 |\n| *Total Expenses & Arbitration Costs* |  | 5,506,199 |\n|  |  |  |\n| *Overall Total* |  | 58,106,313 |\n\n976.\n\nThe Respondent submits that all of its costs should be deducted from any compensation award. This entire arbitration occurred only because the Claimants refused to accept exceedingly generous compensation offers more than nine years ago. The Claimants should not be rewarded for their strategy of rejecting those offers and pursuing a windfall in international arbitration.\n\n977.\n\nThe manner by which the Claimants litigated this case, in both phases, provides further reasons for assessing costs against them. (i) The Claimants and their fact witnesses made over 200 allegations of fiscal guarantees. (ii) The Claimants told the Tribunal that \"Venezuela made it clear that it would not offer compensation based on Fair Market Value\" and it made many other misrepresentations, which had an impact on the majority of the Tribunal, leading to its finding on bad faith negotiation.\n\n978.\n\nIn the second phase of this case, the Claimants did everything they could to avoid a hearing on their misrepresentations and on the finding of bad faith negotiation. It took three years until the Respondent was granted the opportunity to set the record straight. At the August 2016 hearing, Mr. Goff gave frank testimony on the subject of the compensation negotiations and showing that what the Claimants had told the Tribunal had been false.\n\n979.\n\nAt the end of the August 2016 hearing, the Tribunal requested the Parties to present four valuations, including valuations as of 26 June 2007, with and without considering the compensation provisions. That was the first time in this entire litigation that the Claimants showed what they considered to be fair market value as of 26 June 2007. The lengthy delay in this case is attributable in large part to that strategy.\n\n980.\n\nBased on the foregoing factors, all costs should be assessed against the Claimants. The Tribunal has discretion to do so.\n\n981.\n\nThe Respondent did not comment the Claimants' cost submission, except in objecting, in its letter dated 18 April 2018, to the Claimants' attempt to reiterate their allegations of bad faith and misconduct.\n\nC. The Tribunal's Findings\n--------------------------\n\n982.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that the figures for costs and fees of each Party have not been contested by the opposing Party. Although the amounts put forward appear high in comparison to the great majority of ICSID arbitrations, the Tribunal has no reason to inquire about their substance in light of the long duration of this arbitral proceeding, the size of the record and the complexity of a great number of questions raised. The Claimants' reference to a total of 27 memorials and other substantive submissions of more than 3700 pages, and the 33 total hearing days, provide an idea of the size of the case.\n\n983.\n\nThe Parties have not reached an agreement as to the arbitration costs and their allocation. There is no provision in the BIT applicable to this matter770. The Tribunal shall therefore apply Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which reads as follows:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award771.\n\nWhile interest is not mentioned in Article 9(3) of the BIT, the Tribunal concludes that it is included in the term \"compensation\".\n\nArbitration Rule 47(1)(j) confirms that \"any\" decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding shall be contained in the award.\n\n984.\n\nThis provision requires the Tribunal to make its own assessment resulting in a decision. This means implicitly that there does not exist an *a priori* solution on the allocation of costs, like a principle that would require that each party should bear its own costs and that the costs of the tribunal and the ICSID Secretariat should be borne in equal shares by the parties, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration and other circumstances pertinent to the proceeding.\n\n985.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention does not determine any specific factor to be taken into account by the Tribunal for its decision on costs. This means that the Tribunal has wide discretion in determining the allocation of costs of the arbitration, including legal fees and expenses. That said, such discretion should of course be exercised with care and with due regard to the relevant criteria.\n\n986.\n\nArbitral tribunals usually state that when using their discretion, the tribunal will take account of a great number of factors having an influence on the allocation of costs. When looking closer to most awards, the prevailing circumstances are generally the outcome of the case and the procedural behavior and efficiency of the parties.\n\n987.\n\nThe key principle governing the allocation of costs in international arbitration is that costs \"follow the event, *i.e.* the costs are to be borne by the unsuccessful party\". The principle of \"full reparation\", on which the Claimants' claim for costs is based, relies on such an understanding.\n\n988.\n\nHowever, \"full reparation\" cannot mean more, in this respect, than the amount of reparation accepted by the Tribunal. It does not support a claim for costs in proportion to the amounts claimed that have not been allocated by the Tribunal. Additionally, the assessment whether a party had been \"successful\" or not, in full or in part, cannot be based on the decision on quantum only. The outcome of jurisdictional objections also counts. A party's success may also be determined in light of the pertinence of the merits of its case independently from the resulting amounts. These factors will be examined further below.\n\n989.\n\nThe Tribunal does not put particular weight on the manner in which the Parties have conducted the case, keeping in mind the complexity of the case, the enormous size of the evidentiary documentation and the profound analyses provided by the economic and technical experts. Each Party is at liberty in the choice of its strategy in the litigation and the way it considers the most appropriate to assemble and present its evidence. Such choice of methodology should not become a factor of judgment by the Tribunal, even under the ancillary perspective of the allocation of costs, unless a particular behavior during trial shows signs of abuse of process, bad faith or reflects harassing litigation, which should not be awarded any merit in having the opposing party condemned to contributory payment of the associated costs.\n\n990.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal has appreciated the professional and courteous conduct of the proceeding on part of counsel, experts, and witnesses on both sides. Certainly, some pleadings may have shown to be excessive in their content and language, but the Tribunal has not felt being faced with attitudes beyond the limits noted above. The Tribunal also recalls that in its Interim Decision it had not approved the Respondent's allegation on misrepresentation directed against the Claimants, and that it had accepted that Venezuela was not acting in bad faith in the framework of the negotiations with the Claimants, the failure of which ended in the Claimants' initiative to commence these arbitral proceedings. Therefore, in sum, there is no point in penalizing the conduct of this litigation by one or the other side through a corresponding allocation of costs and fees.\n\n991.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the ICSID fees and expenses have been determined irrespective of the amounts claimed and without evaluating the potential success or *prima facie* chance for prevailing before the Tribunal. Therefore, the sharing of the costs of this ICSID proceeding should not be influenced by the respective portion of success or loss of each Party in relation to its claims or defenses. There is no link of causality between the amounts of the costs of the arbitral proceeding and the amounts of damages claimed. These costs are based on the above mentioned circumstances of a highly complex and most extensively documented case. Therefore, neither the principle of \"full reparation\", nor its division in any portion of the claims should have a bearing on the allocation of these costs.\n\n992.\n\nFor this reason, the Tribunal decides that the Tribunal members' fees and expenses, the ICSID administrative fees and other direct expenses have to be evenly divided between the Parties in amounts represented in their statement of costs, and also including the share invoiced after the filing of these statements. The Respondent has not paid the last four advances requested by the ICSID Secretariat, in a total amount of US$ 1,400,000. The Claimants paid this amount in substitution of the Respondent; this amount must be reimbursed by the Respondent to the Claimants. The balance held by the ICSID Secretariat at the end of this proceeding shall be refunded to the Claimants. In order for the Claimants to recover the amount paid in excess of their share, the Respondent shall reimburse the sum of US$ 1,400,000, less the sum refunded by the ICSID Secretariat to the Claimants.\n\n993.\n\nWhen further considering the translation of the principle of \"full reparation\" in the present case to the allocation of costs, the Tribunal must evaluate the respective weight of the Claimants' claims as they are awarded by the Tribunal, in comparison to the pertinence and the success of the Respondent's defenses, relating either to the Tribunal's jurisdiction or to the merits of the case.\n\n994.\n\nThe Tribunal observes at the outset that the Claimants are successful in their principal claim based on the violation of Article 6 of the BIT. This must lead to a decision ordering the Respondent to bear a significant part of the Claimants' legal fees and costs.\n\n995.\n\nThe Claimants submit that had Venezuela not failed to comply with its obligations under the Treaty and international law, \"there would have been no need for this arbitration, and the substantial expenses associated therewith\"772. These expenses are thus burdens among the consequences of Venezuela's conduct. However, such an assumption has no ground in respect of amounts claimed in the arbitral proceeding that have not been made subject of negotiations with Venezuela in order to settle the damages resulting - as alleged by the Claimants - from Venezuela's failure to satisfy its obligations under Article 6(c) of the BIT. At the time of the expropriation, the Claimants considered their assets having a net present value of more than US$ 20 billion773. Such amount is far below the US$ 30 billion claimed in the arbitration. The 20 billion figure was three times higher than the value of the asset trade ConocoPhillips offered to Venezuela in August 2007774. This shows that the 20 billion was a top-figure clearly above the amount that would have been in a range of an acceptable settlement.\n\nClaimants' Statement on Costs, para. 11.\n\nCf. Interim Decision, para. 105, together with the references, in particular Mr. Limbacher's letter to Dr. Mommer, dated 10 August 2007 (R-653).\n\nCf. Interim Decision, para. 103.\n\n996.\n\nAs stated by the *Libananco* Tribunal, quoted by the Claimants, a rule under which costs follow the event also serves the purpose of discouraging unmeritorious actions and of providing a disincentive to over-litigation775. However, such a policy should be followed to the extent only as it sanctions excessive claims, defenses and procedural behaviors. If such threshold is not reached, a tribunal should be reluctant to reject a strategy chosen by a party in good faith twice, first as to the merits and second on the level of costs.\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Ltd. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award dated 2 September 2011, para. 563 (R-451).\n\n997.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the Tribunal compares the shares of the Claimants and those of the Respondent in the success of their claims and defenses, respectively.\n\n998.\n\nThe Claimants' Memorial dated 15 September 2008 determined the total amount of losses as of 31 August 2008 at US$ 20,468,700,000. To this amount was added a gross-up required to make the Claimants whole in respect of U.S. Federal and State Income Taxes in the amount of US$ 9,836,700,000. The total amount of the Claimants' claim was therefore US$ 30,305,400,000776. Based on the up-date as of 31 October 2009 provided in the Claimants' Reply dated 2 November 2009, the above mentioned figures became US$ 19,727,500,000 for the losses and US$ 9,441,000,000 for the tax burden caused by the expropriation, ending in a total amount of US$ 29,168,500,000777.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, paras. 387, 472/473; 2013 Decision, para. 214.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 608.\n\n999.\n\nBased on the findings of the Tribunal's 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, the Claimants determined in their Memorial on Quantum dated 19 May 2014 their stake in foregone cash flows to equity for the period June 2007 to May 2014 as US$ 9,484,811,792, and their stake in project equity as of May 2014 at US$ 9,747,930,323, both figures resulting in a total damages figure of US$ 19,232,742,115778. In the Claimants' Reply on Quantum dated 13 October 2014, the corresponding figures were US$ 10,211,058,984 and US$ 8,653,883,843, resulting in a total of US$ 18,864,942,827779. In the Claimants' Final Submission on Quantum these numbers again changed and became, as of 30 December 2016, US$ 16,070,029,788 and US$ 5,276,159,925, resulting in a damage claim in a total of US$ 21,346,189,713780.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on Quantum, para. 234.\n\nClaimants' Reply on Quantum, para. 457.\n\nClaimants' Final Submission on Quantum, para. 534.\n\n1000.\n\nIn respect of the impact on the costs allocation of these claims and figures, the Tribunal deals firstly with the claim made by the ConocoPhillips Company based on its loss of future tax credits in an amount close to US$ 10 billion. The Tribunal decided in its 2013 Decision that it does not have jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Investment Law and accordingly the claims by ConocoPhillips Company are dismissed781. It also noted that only this Company and not the Dutch companies (the actual Claimants) made these claims and that this Company is not able to claim under the Dutch BIT782. Consequently, this Company had no longer any claim pending before the Tribunal. There was no agreement or order on the discontinuance of the proceeding in respect of the ConocoPhillips Company made or any other formal decision that this Company was no longer a Party to the proceeding. In its communication sent to the Parties on 3 September 2013, the ICSID Secretariat noted that \"in light of the Tribunal's conclusions, the case will be renamed as *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30)\". No decision was made on whether and to what extent the advances paid by or on behalf of the ConocoPhillips parent Company (including the resulting income) remained with the ICSID Secretariat. They were treated as advances attributed to the three remaining Dutch ConocoPhillips companies. The Parties simply have taken note of the disappearance of the ConocoPhillips parent Company from the case783.\n\n2013 Decision, para. 404(a).\n\nCf. 2013 Decision, para. 263.\n\nIn its letter dated 8 September 2013, the Respondent noted that the Tribunal's conclusion \"excludes the bizarre US$10 billion claim of the parent entity, ConocoPhillips Company, for alleged loss of U.S. tax credits, which undoubtedly would have been rejected even if jurisdiction had existed\". The Claimants did not address the matter directly, but noted in their Memorial on Quantum (footnote 1) that the terms \"ConocoPhillips\" are used to refer collectively to the three claimant companies and their predecessors and affiliates, but with the exception of Section VI containing the Request for Relief, made in the name of the three Dutch Companies CPZ, CPH and CGP exclusively, who were henceforth the only claimant parties in this proceeding. The same Memorial was submitted on behalf of these three companies, whereas the ConocoPhillips Company was no longer mentioned as claimant on the cover page.\n\n1001.\n\nThe Tribunal also decided in 2013 that questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the Parties' determination are reserved for future determination784. No objection has ever been raised against this conclusion. The assumption must have been, to the extent it came to the minds of those involved, that the three remaining Dutch ConocoPhillips companies were continuing the proceeding as claimant parties dealing with all potentially remaining procedural issues related to their parent company. The Tribunal concludes therefore that the allocation of fees and costs in this Award includes consideration of the dismissal of ConocoPhillips Company's claim for its loss of future tax credits to the extent it may have an impact on the assessment of costs and fees in the relation of the Parties actually involved in this proceeding.\n\n2013 Decision, para. 404(g).\n\n1002.\n\nThe Claimants lost in their defense of the Respondent's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction they argued to be based on Article 22 of the Investment Law and related to the ConocoPhillips Company's claim for its losses of future tax credits. This claim amounted to nearly US$ 10 billion, corresponding to one third of the total amount claimed when this arbitral proceeding was initiated785. However, the dismissal of this claim cannot have an effect on the allocation of costs in a proportion measured by the amounts involved. This claim was dismissed on grounds of lack of jurisdiction, a result that was not impacted by the amount of the claim. Moreover, this decision was the consequence of the Tribunal's conclusion that the three Dutch ConocoPhillips Companies failed in their argument that Article 22 of the Investment Law included Venezuela's consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\nIn this respect, when addressing the phase ending on 7 September 2013, the Claimants' cost submission of 16 April 2018 refers to a \"Merits Phase\" exclusively (paras 26, 30, Annex B), not observing that this phase included a jurisdictional part.\n\n1003.\n\nWhile the Claimants prevail in their main claim for damages arising out of the expropriation enforced in violation of Article 6(c) of the BIT, the principle of \"full reparation\", to the extent it is applicable, cannot lead to a full allocation of costs and fees to the Claimants in this respect, given the fact that the Tribunal awards approximately 40% of the approximately US$ 21 billion claimed.\n\n1004.\n\nWhen these both factors are taken together, the balance between success and loss on claims would leave the Claimants with about 40% of their initial expropriation claim dressed up to US$ 21 billion, further adjusted by the loss of the ConocoPhillips Company's claim for US$ 10 billion. However, the Tribunal considers that such valuation cannot be made on a basis reflecting claimed amounts only. Figures are not counting alone. The ConocoPhillips tax claim was certainly of an ancillary nature and must have represented a fraction much smaller than a third of each Party's costs and fees. This claim was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, which were the same than those analysed in respect of the three Dutch ConocoPhillips Companies; it did not require an examination of its merits. Therefore, the dismissal of this claim cannot be counted for more than a part of US$ 13.5 million of the Claimants' legal fees and costs out of a total of approximately US$ 40.6 million. The main and overwhelmingly prevailing claim was based on the expropriation and the violation of Article 6 of the BIT, however granted for only 40% of its amount. On the other hand, it must also be taken account of the fact that the submissions and the associated evidence and lawyers' fees were in large part addressing the merits of the claim and its numerous factual and legal elements, independently from the amount of damages. Therefore, the Tribunal's balance focuses on a cost sharing where the Respondent shall share about 40% of the Claimants' fees and disbursements of a total of US$ 64.7 million less the reduction related to the ConocoPhillips Company's tax claim (US$ 13.5 million). The Tribunal therefore orders the Respondent to pay the Claimants (respectively to the claimant company they designate) the amount of US$ 20,461,000 million as contribution to the Claimants' legal fees and costs.\n\n1005.\n\nThe Tribunal also determines that the amount to be paid by the Respondent as reimbursement for legal fees and costs shall be subject to interest. In this respect, the rate of interest is not based on the commercial consideration on which interest on the profit of the investment, respectively on the Claimants' cost of equity, is based. Therefore, the Tribunal retains a rate of 3%, granted as simple interest. No circumstances requiring compounded interest have been demonstrated in this respect.\n\n1006.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Claimants' request to be awarded legal fees and expenses by phases, with the effect that as from the end of each procedural phase the Respondent would be under an obligation to pay the Claimants' fees and expenses related to this phase, with the further effect that compound interest would be triggered as from any of such dates separately.\n\n1007.\n\nSuch an apportionment in several distinct credit amounts relating to fees and costs is not provided for in Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which states that the decision to be made in this respect shall form part of the award, except as the parties otherwise agree. No such agreement has been concluded between the Parties. The assessment and the allocation of legal fees and costs can therefore not become legally effective before the Award is rendered; it cannot trigger preaward interest either. Theoretically, this leaves open the option that fees and costs are calculated on a factual cost-to-date basis, together with interest representing the costs for financing the corresponding expenses during the proceeding. This is not, however, the method the Claimants requested this Tribunal to apply. On the other hand, the Tribunal cannot know whether such calculation has not yet been included in the figures presented by the Claimants, which are not given with their details nor accompanied by an explanation.\n\n1008.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that in their cost submission dated 16 April 2018 the Claimants do not request a separate allocation of costs to the Respondent in respect of each of the seven arbitrator challenges and each of the three reconsideration applications, two of which failed, while the third was equally denied but resulted in a clarification expressed in the Tribunal's Interim Decision. The Claimants have based their cost submission on the exclusive basis of full reparation to be owed by the Respondent, which absorbs the Claimants' costs of these miscellaneous proceedings. Additionally, the Claimants have given finally their preference to a cost allocation by procedural phases, which supersedes their initial requests (in all cases deferred by the Tribunal to a later stage in the proceedings) to have such assessment made in respect of each of such procedural incident separately.\n\n**XVI. Decision**\n-----------------\n\n1009.\n\nThe Tribunal incorporates by reference in this Award the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits dated 3 September 2013 and its Interim Decision dated 17 January 2017.\n\n1010.\n\nBased on the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides:\n\n1. That the Respondent, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, shall pay as compensation for the expropriation enforced on 26 June 2007 in breach of Article 6 of the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela dated 22 October 1991, the following amounts to the Claimants:\n\na. ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (CPZ) US$ 3,386,079,057;\n\nb. ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. (CPH) US$ 4,498,085,150; and\n\nc. ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. (CGP) US$ 562,140,959.\n\n2. The above mentioned amounts shall be paid together with interest at an annual rate of 5.5%, compounded annually, until the date of full and final payment of these amounts.\n\n3. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela shall pay to ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (CPZ) the amount of US$ 286,740,989 based on the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata Association Agreement, together with simple interest until the date of full and final payment at 12-month LIBOR or any other comparable rate in case LIBOR should be discontinued in the future.\n\n4. The claim of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to deduct from the Claimants' claim the amount of US$ 298 million as repayment of a service payment made to the Hamaca Project's lenders by PDVSA is dismissed.\n\n5. The Tribunal declares that the Claimants are under an obligation based on the principle of good faith not to seek double recovery when seeking enforcement, in full or in part, of this Award beyond the amounts awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) through its Final Award dated 24 April 2018 (20549/ASM/JPA) between *Phillips Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited, ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (claimants) and Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A., Corpoguanipa, S.A., PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo, S.A. (respondents)*.\n\n6. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela shall pay the Claimants (respectively the claimant company they designate) the amount of US$ 20,461,000 as contribution to the Claimants' legal fees and costs, together with simple interest at an annual rate of 3% until the date of full and final payment of this amount.\n\n7. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela shall pay to the Claimants (respectively the claimant company they designate) the amount of US$ 1,400,000 representing the advances for costs to ICSID paid by the Claimants in substitution for the Respondent, together with simple interest at an annual rate of 3% until the date of full and final payment of this amount. This amount shall be reduced by the balance refunded by ICSID to the Claimants.\n\n8. Except for the amounts mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs, each Party shall bear its advances for costs paid to ICSID and its own legal fees and costs.\n\n9. Payment by the Respondent of the amounts awarded herein shall be made not later than 60 days after the issuance of the present Award. Interests on the amounts awarded will start to run at the expiration of the above mentioned 60-day period.\n\n10. The Tribunal declares that (a) the Award is net of all applicable Venezuelan taxes; (b) Venezuela shall not tax or attempt to tax the Award; (c) the Claimants have no further taxation obligations to Venezuela in respect of the three Projects; and (d) in case taxes have nonetheless to be paid by the Claimants, the Respondent shall be liable to compensate the Claimants for the corresponding amount in such a way that the amount effectively received by the Claimants after deduction of all applicable taxes corresponds to the full amount (including interest) granted by this Tribunal.\n\n11. To dismiss any other claim submitted by the Parties."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Rectification of the Award", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2019-08-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Rectification of the Award\n------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela signed on 22 October 1991 (the \"BIT\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 18 March 1965 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute relates to the interests of the Claimants in two extra-heavy oil projects located in the region in Venezuela known as the Orinoco Oil Belt (Faja Petrol\u00edfera del Orinoco) \u2013 the \"Petrozuata Project\" and the \"Hamaca Project\", and in an offshore project for the extract of light to medium crude oil \u2013 the \"Corocoro Project\". For each Project, the main underlying legal basis was set up in an Association Agreement, concluded between one of the ConocoPhillips' subsidiaries and one of the subsidiaries of Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (\"PDVSA\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 1 May 2007, a PdVSA subsidiary took control over operations at each of the Projects based on Decree No. 5,200 dated 26 February 2007 (C-5, R-40). On 26 June 2007, the four-month period for reaching agreement set in the Decree expired and Venezuela nationalised ConocoPhillips' interests in the Projects.\n\n4.\n\nOn 2 November 2007, the Claimants submitted to ICSID a Request for Arbitration against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"Venezuela\" or \"the Respondent\") pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention. On 13 December 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on 23 July 2008. It was then reconstituted on 1 February 2010, on 10 August 2015, and lastly on 22 April 2016, when it was composed of Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, a Colombian national, as presiding arbitrator, the Hon. L. Yves Fortier, QC, a Canadian national, and Professor Andreas Bucher, a Swiss national, both as arbitrators.\n\n6.\n\nIn their Request for Arbitration and throughout their subsequent briefs, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal, *inter alia*, declare that Venezuela has breached Article 6 of the BIT by unlawfully expropriating and/or taking measures equivalent to expropriation with respect to ConocoPhillips' investments in Venezuela, and order Venezuela to pay damages to ConocoPhillips for its breaches of the BIT.\n\n7.\n\nOn 3 September 2013, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, and on 17 January 2017 it rendered an Interim Decision.\n\n8.\n\nShortly after rendering its Interim Decision on 17 January 2017, the Tribunal continued with the final phase of this proceeding, relating to quantum. This phase was concluded by the Award dated 8 March 2019.\n\n9.\n\nOn 16 April 2019, within the time limit set at 45 days by Article 49(1) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 49(1), an Application for Rectification was submitted by the Law Firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP (\"Curtis\"), purporting to act on behalf of the Respondent. Together with the Application Curtis enclosed the power of attorney to represent the Respondent in this case, dated 5 April 2019 and granted by Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez Gonz\u00e1lez, Procurador Especial de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela. The Application relates to three clerical and arithmetical issues emerging from the Tribunal's calculations relating to the windfall profit tax and ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V.'s compensation under Section 9.07 of the Petrozuata Association Agreement.\n\n10.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, the ICSID Secretary-General confirmed receipt of the Application of 16 April 2019 and registered the request pursuant to Arbitration Rule 49(2)(a).\n\n11.\n\nOn 19 April 2019, and also within the above mentioned 45-day time limit, a letter was submitted by the Law Firm De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas, Alfredo De Jes\u00fas S. and Alfredo De Jes\u00fas O. (\"De Jes\u00fas\"), making reference to the Notice of Registration dated 18 April 2019 and the Application for Rectification, both documents being attached to the letter.\n\n12.\n\nThe ICSID Secretary-General confirmed receipt of the said letter the same day. It took note of the request to register said Application pursuant to Article 49 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 49. To the Secretary-General's letter was attached the Notice of Registration that had been issued on 18 April 2019.\n\nIn their letter dated 20 April 2019, the Claimants expressed that they consented to the Tribunal addressing the points raised in the Application for Rectification received by ICSID on 16 April 2019. They also submitted that in light of their consent, the Tribunal's review of the Application can be undertaken without deciding the issue of representation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 9 May 2019, De Jes\u00fas (Paris) indicated to the Tribunal that Mr. David Syed of the Law Firm Dentons Europe SC LLP (Prague) (\"Dentons\") shall henceforth be part of the defence team of the Respondent. The letter instructed that any communication relating to the present proceeding shall be transmitted to Mr. Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica (E) and to Mr. Henry Rodr\u00edguez Facchinetti, Gerente General de Litigio. The letter also included a number of addresses relating to members of the De Jes\u00fas Law Firm and attached a power of representation dated 29 April 2019 signed by Mr. Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela (E) in favor of the representatives of the Law Firms De Jes\u00fas and Dentons Europe SC LLP (\"De Jes\u00fas & Dentons\").\n\n14.\n\nIn a further letter dated 10 May 2019, the Claimants responded to the Respondent's 16 April 2019 Application for Rectification. They declared that they agree with the first and the third issues raised by the Respondent. As for the second issue, they submitted that the Respondent had not proven the error it alleged. The explanations provided by the Claimants in this respect will be considered in more detail below. The Claimants concluded that in light of their position, no further submissions on the Respondent's Application were necessary. Moreover, since both declared representatives of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela had submitted the same Application, the Claimants suggested that the Tribunal need not address any issues related to the Respondent's representation.\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent, through the Curtis Law Firm's letter dated 13 May 2019, responded to the Claimants' letter of 10 May 2019 that they agreed there was no need for further submissions with regard to the Application for Rectification since the Claimants have agreed to the first and third mistakes raised by the Respondent and the second mistake was crystal clear.\n\n16.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal's question as to whether either counsel had any additional comments\n\n17.\n\non the items for rectification submitted in the Application for Rectification filed with the Tribunal, the only reply received was the Claimants' letter dated 29 May 2019, noting that the Respondent had failed to prove its claim in respect of its asserted second error.\n\n**II. The Parties**\n-------------------\n\nA. The Claimants\n----------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimants and Parties to this proceeding on rectification of the Award dated 8 March 2019 are ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (\"CPZ\"), ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. (\"CPH\"), and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. (\"CGP\" \u2013 collectively, \"ConocoPhillips\" or \"the Claimants\").\n\n19.\n\nThe Award includes the name of another Claimant, the ConocoPhillips Company, the parent company of the three subsidiaries mentioned above. Since 3 September 2013, when this Company's claims were dismissed in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, it no longer participated in this proceeding. The name of this Company was included as a Party in the Award for the mere purpose of incorporating the 2013 Decision into the Award and assessing the impact of such dismissal on the allocation of legal fees and costs (paras. 39 and 1000/1001). Therefore, the Conoco Phillips Company is not a Party to this proceeding on the rectification of the Award as this proceeding refers to matters that have nothing to do with this Company's position and claims.\n\nB. The Respondent\n-----------------\n\n20.\n\nThere is no dispute in the present proceeding about the proper identification of the Respondent and Applicant as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"the Respondent\" or \"Venezuela\").\n\n21.\n\nAn issue of representation results from the different documents submitted as powers of representation on behalf of Venezuela to this Tribunal.\n\n22.\n\nOne document submitted by the Law Firm Curtis as a power of attorney was issued by Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez Gonz\u00e1lez, Procurador Especial de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela, on 5 April 2019.\n\n23.\n\nAnother document was referred to by De Jes\u00fas in their letter dated 19 April 2019, as a power of attorney granted on 6 March 2019 by Mr. Reinaldo Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, signed as the Republic's Acting Attorney General. This Power of Attorney had been submitted on 7 March 2019. It expressly provided for the revocation of the mandate previously granted to Curtis by the Office of the Attorney General of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. After having recalled Curtis' lack of power resulting from this revocation, the letter declares that the De Jes\u00fas Law Firm herewith submits \"on behalf of the Republic the Application that was previously submitted by our colleagues from Curtis which you will find enclosed.\" Counsel also requested that the said Application be registered pursuant to Article 49 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 49. The terms of this letter purport to demonstrate that the De Jes\u00fas power to act as attorney for the Respondent is based on the power issued on 6 March 2019, and that the revocation of the Curtis' power formerly granted by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic had the effect that Curtis was no longer holding any power to act on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\n24.\n\nA supplementary document submitted as a power of attorney dated 29 April 2019 by Mr. Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica (E), was issued in favor of both Law Firms, De Jes\u00fas (Panama) and Dentons (London/Prague).\n\n25.\n\nThe submission of different documents as powers of attorneys may raise an issue of representation, opposing on two sides law firms both claiming to be the Respondent's representative. However, the true issue before the Tribunal is to identify the Parties, and in particular the Respondent, and to identify its position that must be addressed through the Tribunal's findings. In this respect, the Tribunal is not faced with any conflicting position or submission. Firstly, as both representatives state that they act on behalf of the Respondent, there is no dispute that they represent the same Party, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. There is no other individual or firm claiming any similar power on behalf of Venezuela. Secondly, there is no conflict about the substance of the issues on rectification before the Tribunal. Indeed, on both sides of the representatives declaring to act on behalf of the Respondent, the Application for Rectification is identical to the Request dated 16 April 2019. Therefore, the issue related to the correct designation of the Respondent's representatives is moot and does not require any decision from the Tribunal.\n\n26.\n\nA requirement to verify counsel's power of attorney does not result either from the usual listing of the \"Parties' representatives\" on the second page of the Decision's introductory part. Such a list is usual but it is not required with the terms used in its heading. Indeed, Article 48 of the ICSID Convention does not contain such a requirement, and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(d) requires that an award shall contain \"the names of the agents, counsel and advocates of the parties\", with no reference being made to the power of representation or its verification. Moreover, it has not been required on behalf of either Party that the content and effects of the powers of attorney be considered as a question submitted to the Tribunal with the effect that this Tribunal would be required to decide the issue pursuant to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i). Hence, the list of \"Parties' representatives\" provided in this Decision does not imply a decision in respect of a legal question submitted to the Tribunal. Therefore, this Decision sets up this list by including the identity of the Parties, law firms and counsel that have participated in this proceeding, and thus accept that they will receive notification of this Decision, without making any ruling about the validity of the powers of attorney that have been submitted.\n\n**III. The Application for Rectification**\n------------------------------------------\n\nA. Preliminary Observations\n---------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent's Application is based on Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention that reads as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. Its decision shall become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in the same manner as the award. The periods of time provided for under paragraph (2) of Article 51 and paragraph (2) of Article 52 shall run from the date on which the decision was rendered.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent and Applicant raises three arithmetical issues that are related to and have effects upon the following parts of the Award's decision in paragraph 1010:\n\n1. That the Respondent, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, shall pay as compensation for the expropriation enforced on 26 June 2007 in breach of Article 6 of the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela dated 22 October 1991, the following amounts to the Claimants:\n\na. ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (CPZ) US$ 3,386,079,057;\n\nb. ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. (CPH) US$ 4,498,085,150; and\n\nc. ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. (CGP) US$ 562,140,959.\n\n2. The above mentioned amounts shall be paid together with interest at an annual rate of 5.5%, compounded annually, until the date of full and final payment of these amounts.\n\n3. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela shall pay to ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (CPZ) the amount of US$ 286,740,989 based on the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata Association Agreement, together with simple interest until the date of full and final payment at 12-month LIBOR or any other comparable rate in case LIBOR should be discontinued in the future.\n\n29.\n\nThe three items raised in the Respondent's Application are all related to the Windfall Profit Tax (WPT), including its calculation (first item) and its impact on the compensation owed to ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (CPZ) on the basis of Section 9.07 of the Petrozuata Association Agreement (second and third items). In their letter dated 10 May 2019, the Claimants have declared that in respect of the first and the third items, the Award should be corrected as requested by the Respondent, while they submit that the Respondent's allegation in respect of the second item is unsupported but nonetheless left in the hands of the Tribunal.\n\n30.\n\nArticle 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, quoted above, requires a party to submit a request to have any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award rectified by the Tribunal. The provision does not mention that the Tribunal could undertake a rectification of such an error on its own motion. This is not the issue in the instant case. The Respondent has alleged an error in the calculation of the amounts listed in column 4 of the table of paragraph 785. It invokes Article 49(2) and requests the Tribunal to proceed with the rectification of the error. However, if in the correction of the error of an amount identified by the Respondent the Tribunal finds that the same amount includes another error, the Tribunal could not simply correct the error invoked by the Respondent knowing that another error exists in the same amount and that it has an effect in the Award. In case the requesting party has correctly identified a clerical or arithmetical error in an amount, it is the Tribunal's duty not only to correct the error invoked by the requesting party but other errors in the same amount, so that all erroneous components of the Award related to the same amount are corrected. Otherwise the Tribunal would be correcting a mathematical error in an amount but leaving in place another mathematical error related to the same amount. This is part of the Tribunal's inherent decision-making power that it exercises independently from the party's application. If this is done, as in the instant case, the Tribunal must proceed with the rectification in such a way that the total outcome of the Award is correct. For example, (1) if the requesting party identifies the error correctly, but declares that it is not able to make the appropriate correction and to provide a number, the Tribunal must proceed with the rectification and determine the solution; and (2) if the requesting party identifies the error correctly and offers a rectified number or amount and the Tribunal considers that there is indeed an error but that the calculation by the requesting party resulting from the error is incorrect, the Tribunal, while accepting the error, can proceed with the rectification based on its own assessment of the correct solution, which may not be the same as the one which has been submitted by the requesting party. Both situations can be seen when considering the Respondent's Application and the respective parts of the Award.\n\nB. The First Item\n-----------------\n\n31.\n\nFirstly, the Respondent points to errors contained in the Tribunal's calculations of the Windfall Profit Tax (WPT) in paragraph 773 of the Award in respect of each of the three Projects. The Tribunal notes that in order to achieve its WPT figures, the Tribunal applied in each case its calculated rate to the production figures. However, in so doing, the Tribunal omitted to include two decimals in its calculations for certain years. For instance, for the year 2012 in Petrozuata, the correct number should have been US$ 5,430,000 (36,200,000 x 0.15) instead of US$ 54,300. Another example is the year 2028 for Hamaca, where the correct number should have been US$ 106,872,000 (58,400,000 x 1.83) instead of US$ 1,068,720.\n\n32.\n\nIn the case of Petrozuata, this error affects, according to the Respondent, the estimated values of the WPT payable by the Project for the years 2010 and 2021 through 20261. The impact of this error on the compensation amount as set forth in paragraph 1010(1) of the Award is a reduction of US$ 13,098,972 in the case of Petrozuata (CPZ).\n\nThus, the figures contained in the Award, para. 773, *i.e.* US$ 68,780 (2010) and US$ 54,300 (2021), 141,180 (2022), 228,060 (2023), 231,420 (2024), 245,310 (2025) and 256,500 (2026), should become greater by adding two decimals, resulting in US$ 6,878,000 (2010) and US$ 5,430,000 (2021), 14,118,000 (2022), 22,806,000 (2023), 23,142,000 (2024), 24,531,000 (2025) and 25,650,000 (2026).\n\n33.\n\nThe same pattern is noted in respect of Hamaca, where the affected yearly amounts for the WPT are those for 2010 and 2021 through 20362. The impact on the total compensation allocated in respect of Hamaca (CPH) in paragraph 1010(1) of the Award is a reduction of US$ 54,962,316.\n\nThe figures in the Award, para. 773, *i.e.* US$ 93,440 (2010) and US$ 87,600 (2021), 227,760 (2022), 364,920 (2023), 508,080 (2024), 648,240 (2025), 788,400 (2026), 928,560 (2027), 1,068,720 (2028), 1,208,880 (2029), 1,349,040 (2030), 1,489,200 (2031), 1,582,640 (2032), 1,769,520 (2033), 1,667,700 (2034), 1,649,700 (2035), and 1,612,500 (2036), should become greater by adding two decimals, resulting in US$ 9,344,000 (2010) and US$ 8,760,000 (2021), 22,776,000 (2022), 36,492,000 (2023), 50,808,000 (2024), 64,824,000 (2025), 78,840,000 (2026), 92,856,000 (2027), 106,872,000 (2028), 120,888,000 (2029), 134,904,000 (2030), 148,920,000 (2031), 158,264,000 (2032), 176,952,000 (2033), 166,770,000 (2034), 164,970,000 (2035), and 161,250,000 (2036).\n\n34.\n\nFinally, for Corocoro, the same type of error affects the values of the WPT payable in respect of the years 2008, 2010 and 2021 through 20263, resulting in a total reduction in the case of Corocoro (CGP) of US$ 10,081,870.\n\nThe amounts noted in the table under para. 773, *i.e.* US$ 410,810 (2008), 76,281 (2010), 10,807 (2021), 26,383 (2022), 39,488 (2023), 49,946 (2024), 61,138 (2025), and 71, 509 (2026), should become greater by adding two decimals, resulting in US$ 41,081,000 (2008), 7,628,100 (2010), 1,080,700 (2021), 2,638,300 (2022), 3,948,800 (2023), 4,994,600 (2024), 6,113,800 (2025), and 7,150,900 (2026).\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent adds that in addition to the corrections to be made in the tables under paragraph 773 of the Award and the final conclusion in its paragraph 1001(1), the omission of the two decimals should be also rectified in paragraphs 777, 779, 785, 954 of the Award, *i.e.* in each case where the compensation for the three Projects is impacted by the WPT. The amounts mentioned above deal with these further rectifications carried forward in all instances where net revenue, dividends and discounts are at their inception dependent on the cost item represented by the WPT. The Respondent has not submitted the corrected calculations in detail in this regard. Its Application contains an illustration for the year 2028 at Hamaca, with detailed figures that are correct4.\n\nApplication for Rectification, footnote 4.\n\n36.\n\nIn their letter dated 10 May 2019, the Claimants agreed that the figures identified in the tables contained in paragraph 773 of the Award should be corrected. They also agreed with the total amount of the reductions to be adopted for each of the Projects in paragraph 1010(1) of the Award.\n\n37.\n\nWhile the Tribunal retains for due consideration the Parties' agreement on the rectification requested by the Respondent, it also notes that such an agreement is not directed to a claim or a defense raised before the Tribunal, but affects directly the Tribunal's decision. The Parties' common views must therefore be in the nature of an error in the Tribunal's calculations that the Tribunal can accept.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that the Respondent's Application for Rectification does not contest the Tribunal's calculation of the volume of production, the total income and the WPT rate. The Application concerns only the last step in the calculation, being the determination of the US$ amount for the WPT based on a given rate for certain years.\n\n39.\n\nTaking Petrozuata as an illustration, the Respondent accepts the calculation for year 2014, noting that the rate was 10.80 and that it had to be applied to a total production of \"MMB\" 36,200,000 (*i.e.* barrels), resulting in an amount of US$ 390,960,000. The Respondent also notes that this is based on the calculation: 36,200,000 x 10.80.\n\n40.\n\nYear 2021 is one of the years for Petrozuata where an error is alleged. The Tribunal adopted a rate of 0.15 (which is not contested), and came to a result of US$ 54,300, calculated as 0.15% of 36,200,000. The Respondent contends that two decimals were omitted, because the calculation should be: 0.15 x 36,200,000 = US$ 5,430,000\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the difference to which the Respondent points is not simply that it omitted two decimals for some years. The difference between the numbers in the Award and the Respondent's submission is based on a difference in understanding what the \"rate\" means.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent uses the rate as a fraction of the total production figures (which is in most years 36,200,000 barrels). Thus, it submits that for year 2021, the rate of 0.15 has to be applied as a multiplier to the production figure of 36,200,000; in other words, the rate triggers a tax of US$ 0.15 for each barrel (= 15 cents per barrel). This results in a total of US$ 5,430,000.\n\n43.\n\nThe Award's rate is used as a percentage of each barrel expressed in US$. Thus, each barrel triggers a tax of 0.15%, and the full production of 36,200,000 converts into a tax of 0.15% of this figure, which is US$ 54,300.\n\n44.\n\nOn the basis of the explanations contained in the Award (paras. 723-725), the Tribunal recalls that pursuant to Decree No. 8,807 of 15 April 2008 (R-500, C-252/582), the tax was assessed at the rate of 50% equal to US$ 0.50 for every dollar that the average price to be considered exceeded US$ 70. When this reference price exceeded US$ 100, the tax went up to 60%, respectively US$ 0.60 per dollar (Art. 1 para. 2). Based on Decree No. 8,163 of 18 April 2011 (R-501, C-587), when the tax was determined by reference to a price fixed in the Budget Law, 20% (0.20 per dollar) were to be paid up to a threshold of the monthly average (extraordinary) price of Venezuelan liquid of US$ 70 per barrel (Art. 7). When prices were greater and became \"exorbitant\", but lower than US$ 90 per barrel, the tax went up to 80% for any price between these two amounts, and it went further up to 90% within a margin of US$ 90 to US$ 100, and 95% in respect of any amount above US$ 100 (Art. 9). As per Decree No. 40,114, effective as from 21 February 2013 (R-502, C-600), the initial rate of 20% went up from the Budget Law price to US$ 80 per barrel (extraordinary price \u2013 Art. 7). From there, when prices became higher and were considered to be \"exorbitant\", a tax of 80% applied up to the threshold of US$ 100, and above, 90% applied up to the level of US$ 110. When prices went higher, equal or greater than US$ 110, the tax rate was 95% (Art. 9).\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while for each relevant layer, percentages of a certain amount of US$ are used, the resulting rate is determined in terms of US$, equally applicable at the level of each layer, to the extent applicable (Art. 1.3 of Decree No. 8,807 of 2008). Thus, when taking again the example of year 2014, which is not challenged, the rate of 10.80 represents an amount of 10.80 US$ per barrel5 to be applied to a production of 36,200,000 barrels. This results in a WPT of US$ 390,960,000, as mentioned above.\n\nWith more details, the rate of 10.80 is composed of 20% of 1 US$ up to a (extraordinary) price of US$ 80 per barrel (= 4$/b), and of 80% of every US$ for the portion between US$ 80 per barrel and the difference between the Venezuela Basket (US$ 88.54) and US$ 80/b (= 6.83 US$). See also Brailovsky/Flores, Appendice BF-406, Special Contribution.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that the increase in certain yearly amounts of WPT has an immediate impact on the net revenue per year, combined with the output based on the 50% income tax. As a further consequence, the dividends together with the Update (9.75%) and the Discount (17.25%) must also be rectified. This affects the amounts listed in the tables under paragraphs 777, 779, and 954 of the Award. To the extent relevant, these amounts are to be corrected as follows (*italics*):\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Petrozuata |\n|  | WPT | Subtotal before Income Tax | Income Tax 50% | Net Revenue | Dividends CPZ -

This correction is carried forward here, resulting in US$ 36, 7 92,000.\n\nThe Tribunal uses the correct numbers for the two last digits instead of the simple addition of two decimals.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the results of its calculation are very close for Hamaca and Corocoro to the figures submitted by the Respondent, while there appears to be a difference in respect of Petrozuata. The source of this difference cannot be identified on the basis of the Respondent's Application that does not contain detailed calculations in this respect.\n\n48.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal accepts the reduction requested by the Respondent, and agreed by the Claimants, based on an error in the calculation of the WPT for some years, for the total amounts of US$ 15,123,640 in the case of Petrozuata (CPZ), of US$ 54,962,265 in respect of Hamaca (CPH), and of US$ 10,081,868 for Corocoro (CGP). As a consequence, the amounts mentioned in paragraph 1010(1) of the Award are rectified as follows:\n\na. ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (CPZ) US$ 3,370,955,417;\n\nb. ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. (CPH) US$ 4,443,122,885;\n\nc. ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. (CGP) US$ 552,059,091.\n\nC. The Second Item\n------------------\n\n49.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent addresses the table in paragraph 785 in respect of the compensation to be provided in the case of Petrozuata. This error is alleged to result from the Award's option to determine the compensation to be paid under paragraph 1010(3) of the Award as corresponding to the entirety of the Petrozuata Project, and not to CPZ's interest in this Project, which is 50.1%. The \"significant economic damage\" to the shareholders other than the Class A Privileged shareholders cannot be based on numbers that correspond to the total amount of the WPT paid by both PDVSA and CPZ. Therefore, the Tribunal's calculations in paras. 785, 829 and 1010(3) need to be proportionally adjusted to reflect the correct percentage of CPZ's ownership in the Petrozuata Project, as this was correctly made by the Tribunal in paragraph 779 of the Award with respect to the calculation of dividends.\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimants submit in their letter dated 10 May 2019 that the Respondent's allegation was unsupported, as it had not shown that CPZ's ownership interest of 50.1% has not been taken into account in the calculation. The Claimants note that the Tribunal may explain precisely how it accounted for this interest and that, therefore, this second issue is entirely in the hands of the Tribunal. For the Respondent, in the letter dated 13 May 2019 submitted by Curtis, it is untenable to argue that the Respondent has not shown that CPZ's ownership interest was not taken into account by the Tribunal, as the methodology and pertinent calculations are set out in paragraphs 780-785 of the Award. The Claimants reply in their letter dated 29 May 2019 that these paragraphs demonstrate that the Tribunal was well aware of the Association Agreement's concept of \"Significant Economic Damage\", which by definition applies only to the interests of CPZ.\n\n51.\n\nThe benefit of the compensation provided in Section 9.07 of the Petrozuata Association Agreement accrues to the Class B Shareholder only, and not to the Class A Shareholder (cf. paras. 163, 781). The significant economic damage is taken into account in respect of the Shareholders other than the Class A Shareholders (Sec. 1.01); such damage is determined by calculating the dividends that a Class B Shareholder would have otherwise received.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent states correctly that the WPT would have affected the Project in its entirety and thus reduced the dividends of both Class A and B Shareholders in proportion of their holding in the Project, which is 50.1% for CPZ. In fact, such reduction of the ConocoPhillips affiliate's dividends is contained in the Tribunal's determination of the compensation due to this Party, which includes the amounts due under the WPT Law to the effect that the revenue of the Project and of its Shareholders are reduced accordingly. Therefore, the respective share of CPZ in respect of the WPT, and its resulting damage under the Discriminatory Action provisions, corresponds to its 50.1% participation in the Project.\n\n53.\n\nThe rectification claimed results for each year concerned in the amounts of US$ 24,067,419 (2009), 22,552,210 (2012), 37,316,742 (2014) and 50,702,865 (2015), a total of US$ 134,639,236.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimants objected to the Respondent's submission that its allegation was unsupported. Depending on how one looks at the figures, the Claimants' observation is not wrong. The Respondent submits that it had shown that CPZ's ownership interest was correctly taken into account in the Award, referring to paragraphs 780-785. While Respondent is correct, it does not answer the Claimants' criticism, which is focused on the table in paragraph 785 only. Therefore, this requires an explanation from the Tribunal.\n\n55.\n\nThe figures in column 4 of the table in paragraph 785 cannot be explained on the basis of the underlying components of the calculation, independently of the 50.1% proportion that should be included as a reduction. These components are the 25% percentage of the WPT listed for each year, where relevant, in column 2. When these figures are reduced to the 25% part, which is one quarter, and then further reduced on the basis of Article 14 WPT Law (for the three years where it applies, as noted in column 3), the resulting amounts demonstrate that they do not match with the numbers in column 4. This distortion explains why the Respondent was not able to make a demonstration focusing directly on the figures set up in column 4, and why the Claimants did not attempt to present a counter-calculation, merely suggesting that for the purpose of identifying whether a clerical or arithmetical error exists, the Tribunal may, if it so accepts to proceed, disclose the detailed workings underlying each of the figures under discussion.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the figures in column 4 were calculated on the basis of amounts of WPT different from those finally retained in the table of paragraph 785 of the Award. As the drafting of the Award was ongoing, the amounts representing the WPT were changed (column 2), but the subsequent calculation of the ensuing amounts of compensation relating to Petrozuata (column 4) were not adjusted accordingly. This is an arithmetical error.\n\n57.\n\nThe Parties have not identified this error because they did not find an explanation for the figures retained in column 4, except as to the missing reduction based on CPZ's 50.1% share of dividends. In other words, the Parties were aware of an error affecting these amounts, but they could not know that the same figures were affected by a second calculation error.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes therefore that the amounts listed in column 4 of the table under paragraph 785 should be rectified in two respects: (1) a new calculation must be made based on the amounts for WPT as listed in column 2 (25% less the reduction based on Article 14 WPT Law where applicable), and (2) reducing the resulting amount by the proportion of 50.1% corresponding to the CPZ's share of dividends under the Petrozuata Association Agreement. The elements of this calculation are as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ConocoPhillips' Compensation (Petrozuata) |\n|  | WPT US$8 | Reduction based on Article 14 WPT | Compensation owed to CPZ (50.1%) |\n| Award (para. 785) | The Respondent's Request | Tribunal's adjusted calculation |\n| 2007 \u00bd | -- |  | -- | -- |  |\n| 2008 | 219,560,559 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2009 |  |  | 48,038,760 | 24,067,419 | 27,499,960 |\n| 2010 | 6,878,000 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2011 | 965,816,000 | - 195,256,640 | 0 |  |  |\n| 2012 | 1,165,640,000 | - 320,042,624 | 45,014,391 | 22,552,210 | 23,144,877 |\n| 2013 | 836,220,000 | - 128,824,817 | 0 |  |  |\n| 2014 | 390,960,000 |  | 74,484,514 | 37,316,742 | 40,195,322 |\n| 2015 | 0 |  | 101,203,324 | 50,702,865 | 48,967,740 |\n| 2016 | 0 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2017 | 0 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2018 | 0 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2019 | 0 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2020 | 0 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2021 | 5,430,000 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2022 | 14,118,000 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2023 | 22,806,000 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2024 | 23,142,000 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2025 | 24,531,000 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| 2026 | 25,650,000 |  | 0 |  |  |\n| Total | 3,700,751,559 | - 644,124,081 | 286,740,9899 | 134,639,236 | 139,807,899 |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4a | 4b | 4c |\n\nThe rectification operated in relation to the first item of the Respondent's request has the effect of modifying the amounts for the years 2010 and 2021 through 2026. These amounts, when corrected, do not trigger a right for compensation pursuant to the applicable compensation provision.\n\nThis amount is addressed below as the third item to be corrected in order to read as US$ 2 68,740,989.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts therefore that the table in paragraph 785 should be amended on the basis of the amounts listed above in column 4c, and that the total figure of US$ 139,807,899 is included in paragraphs 829 and 1010(3) of the Award.\n\nD. The Third Item\n-----------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondent points to a third error in the Award's calculation in the same table in paragraph 785, last column, where the total compensation due to ConocoPhillips is determined as US$ 286,740,989. The Tribunal recognizes that an inversion of numbers occurred when this final figure was written down, and that it should read as US$ 2 68,740,989. This would also apply to the corresponding figure in paragraphs 829 and 1010(3) of the Award. In their letter dated 10 May 2019, the Claimants accept this rectification.\n\n61.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal observes that this error relates to the figures noted above. It has no bearing in relation to the rectification based on the second error identified by the Respondent. This latter rectification consists in replacing the amount of US$ 286,740,989 by the sum of US$ 139,807,899 (that the Respondent suggested to be US$ 134,639,236). The Respondent's calculations do not purport to cumulate the corrected figures if both items 2 and 3 were accepted10. The overall reduction it claims is US$ 152,101,754, an amount that reflects the reduction resulting from the correction requested in respect of the second item in relation to each yearly amount listed in the table in paragraph 785. The amount of US$ 286,740,989 is no longer pertinent once the rectification related to this second item is operated. Therefore, in light of the rectification accepted in respect of the second item, the Tribunal dismisses the rectification claimed under the third item.\n\nThe same position has been correctly recalled in the Respondent's letter submitted by Curtis on 13 May 2019 where the conclusion in respect of the second item is presented to the effect that \"the Award should be reduced by US$ 134,101,754\", and that this is \"in addition to the reductions Claimants have already accepted in their letter of May 10, 2019\". If the correction submitted as item 1 is taken alone, the reduction based on item 3 would be for US$ 18,000,000, resulting in a total reduction of US$ 152,101,754, when applied to the figure of US$ 286,740,989 mentioned in the Award. If this last amount is rectified to US$ 268,740,989, the resulting correction is for US$ 134,101,753.\n\n**IV. Legal Fees and Costs**\n----------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe three items raised by the Respondent in its Application for Rectification have been accepted by the Claimants in respect of the first and the third items. As to the second item, the Claimants did not object that it could be reconsidered by the Tribunal. In sum, there is no clear disagreement between the Parties that would allow allocating legal fees and costs based on the principle that the costs are to be borne by the unsuccessful party. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the most reasonable and equitable solution is that each Party bears its own legal fees and costs.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal is also of the view that the sharing of the costs of this ICSID proceeding should not be driven by the success or loss of each Party. Therefore, the Tribunal decides that the costs related to the Tribunal members' fees and expenses, the ICSID Administrative fees and other direct expenses must be divided evenly between the Parties. The Tribunal recalls that the Claimants and the Respondent have each paid their respective share (US$ 150,000 each) of the advances requested by the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n**V. Decision**\n---------------\n\n64.\n\nBased on the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides:\n\n1. That paragraph 1010(1) of the Award's Decision is rectified and reads as follows:\n\n1. That the Respondent, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, shall pay as compensation for the expropriation enforced on 26 June 2007 in breach of Article 6 of the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela dated 22 October 1991, the following amounts to the Claimants:\n\na. ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (CPZ) US$ 3,370,955,417;\n\nb. ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. (CPH) US$ 4,443,122,885;\n\nc. ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. (CGP) US$ 552,059,091.\n\n2. That paragraph 1010(3) of the Award's Decision is rectified and reads as follows:\n\n3. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela shall pay to ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (CPZ) the amount of US$ 139,807,899 based on the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata Association Agreement, together with simple interest until the date of full and final payment at 12-month LIBOR or any other comparable rate in case LIBOR should be discontinued in the future.\n\n3. To dismiss any other application for rectification.\n\n4. That each of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Claimants bear their respective share of the advance for costs paid to ICSID.\n\n5. That each Party bears its own legal fees and costs."}, {"Title": "Order on the Applicant's Representation", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2020-04-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Order on the Applicant's Representation\n---------------------------------------\n\n**I. Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 27 November 2019, the Centre received an electronic copy (without exhibits) of an \"Application for Annulment\" of the Award rendered on 8 March 2019, in the present proceedings, submitted by Mr. George Kahale from the law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP (\"Curtis\") on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Along with the Application, the Centre received the lodging fee.\n\n2.\n\nUpon delivery of the corresponding hard copies, supporting documentation and USB drives, the Centre transmitted the Application \"to counsel of record in the arbitration proceedings\" (i.e. Freshfields and Three Crowns on behalf of the Conoco parties and Curtis, De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas and Dentons on the side of Venezuela).\n\n3.\n\nOn 5 December 2019, the Centre received an electronic copy (without exhibits) of an \"Application for Annulment\" submitted by Dr. Alfredo De Jes\u00fas O. from the law firm De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas (\"De Jes\u00fas\"). The Application was signed by Mr. Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, *Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela* (E) (Acting Attorney General) \"in representation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela by the *Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica de Venezuela*\" and was substantively identical to the one filed by Curtis on 27 November 2019. The Centre also received the corresponding lodging fee. On 16 December 2019, electronic copies of this Application were transmitted \"to counsel of record in the arbitration proceedings.\"\n\n4.\n\nOn 16 December 2019, the Centre wrote to the parties in reference to \"the Application for Annulment submitted by Mr. George Kahale on November 27, 2019, and by Dr. Alfredo De Jes\u00fas O. on December 5, 2019, on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\" The parties were informed that the Secretary-General \"registered an Application for Annulment of the Award rendered on March 8, 2019.\"\n\n5.\n\nNeither Curtis nor De Jes\u00fas addressed the issue of Venezuela's representation at that stage or identified the authority upon which it purported to act for Venezuela.1\n\nEarlier in the post-award proceedings, Mr. Kahale submitted a power of attorney granted to him by Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez Gonz\u00e1lez, *Procurador Especial de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela* (Special Attorney General), when he filed the Application for Rectification of the Award that led to the \"Decision on Rectification\". The Centre registered that request on 18 April 2019.  \nThe power of attorney included the authority to file an annulment application on behalf of Venezuela. Up until 6 March 2019, Curtis had acted in the arbitration proceedings upon the authority of a power of attorney that was revoked on March 6, 2019 by the Acting Attorney General.  \nDuring the rectification proceeding, the Centre also received a power of attorney signed by the Acting Attorney General, Mr. Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, to the law Firms De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas and Dentons Europe SC LLP. The power of attorney included the authority to file an annulment application on behalf of Venezuela.  \nIn its \"Decision on Rectification\" the Tribunal did not decide on the representation of Venezuela. It considered that this was unnecessary because there were no conflicting positions (a single Rectification Request was filed) and it was clear that Venezuela was the proper party to the proceeding. It listed on the back side of the cover of the Decision on Rectification all counsel mentioned above.\n\n6.\n\nOn 3 February 2020, the Committee was constituted, and the parties were informed that the annulment proceedings were deemed to have begun.\n\n7.\n\nOn 4 February 2020, the Respondent on Annulment (hereinafter \"Conoco\" or the \"Claimants\") opposed Venezuela's request to continue the stay of enforcement. The Claimants also proposed a briefing schedule.\n\n8.\n\nOn 5 February 2020, the Committee invited the Applicant (hereinafter also referred to as \"Venezuela\" or the \"Respondent\") to comment on Claimants' procedural proposals.\n\n9.\n\nOn 11 February 2020, Curtis rejected Claimants' proposed schedule and proposed instead 16 March 2020 for Venezuela's response.\n\n10.\n\nOn 12 February 2020, De Jes\u00fas proposed the same deadline for Venezuela's response (i.e. 16 March 2020).\n\n11.\n\nOn 13 February 2020, the Claimants objected to Venezuela's proposed deadline and made an alternative proposal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 18 February 2020, the Committee fixed 16 March 2020 for Venezuela's response on the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n13.\n\nOn 20 February 2020, the Committee circulated a draft procedural order concerning the organization of the proceedings. The parties were invited to confer on the draft and to submit a joint proposal including any agreed amendments.\n\n14.\n\nOn 25 February 2020, the Committee fixed a date for the first session and proposed additional dates for a hearing on the issue of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n15.\n\nOn 2 March 2020, De Jes\u00fas, Curtis and the Claimants confirmed their availability on the proposed dates.\n\n16.\n\nOn 13 March 2020, De Jes\u00fas and Claimants submitted their comments and proposals on the draft procedural order circulated on 20 February 2020. So too did Curtis on 14 March 2020.\n\n17.\n\nOn 15 March 2020, De Jes\u00fas sent a letter asking the Committee to \"exclude the participation\" of Curtis from this proceeding on the basis that it is acting on a power of attorney issued by \"a person who does not exercise any authority or power within the Venezuelan legal system.\"\n\n18.\n\nOn 16 March 2020, De Jes\u00fas and Curtis submitted each a response on Claimants' Opposition to Venezuela's Request to Continue the Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n\n19.\n\nOn 19 March 2020, the Committee invited Curtis and the Claimants to comment on De Jes\u00fas' 15 March letter regarding Venezuela's representation in this proceeding.\n\n20.\n\nCurtis and the Claimants submitted their respective comments on 30 March 2020. De Jes\u00fas replied on 31 March 2020.\n\n**II. The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\nA. *De Jes\u00fas*\n-------------\n\n21.\n\nIn the letter to the Committee of 15 March 2020, De Jes\u00fas contends that the Parties' efforts to confer on the draft procedural order circulated by the Committee in preparation for the First Session and Preliminary Procedural Consultation were thwarted by the presence of the law firm of Curtis, which is a third party in the annulment proceedings.\n\n22.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas submits that Curtis wrongfully presents itself as a representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela although its power of representation was revoked during the arbitration on 6 March 2019 by Venezuela's Acting Attorney General, Mr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, as notified to ICSID on 9 May 2020. Curtis's current power of attorney has been issued by Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, a Venezuelan attorney, who presents himself as a Special Attorney under a statute passed by the Venezuelan National Assembly on 5 February 2019. The statute was however annulled by the Venezuelan Supreme Court of Justice on 8 February 2019.\n\n23.\n\nCurtis nonetheless presented on 16 April 2019 an Application for Rectification of the Award on behalf of Venezuela. De Jes\u00fas resubmitted the Application on 19 April 2019.\n\n24.\n\nCurtis next presented an Application for Annulment on 27 November 2019, followed on 5 December 2019 by an Application filed by De Jes\u00fas.\n\n25.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas asks the Committee to rule, even before the issuance of the Procedural Order pertaining to the First Session and Preliminary Procedural Consultation, on the issue of representation and to exclude from the annulment proceedings any third party and in particular Curtis.\n\n26.\n\nIn its letter to the Committee of 31 March 2020, De Jes\u00fas declares that the issue of representation of Venezuela is not a political question but one of procedure that the Committee is empowered to resolve. De Jes\u00fas says that the *status quo* which must be maintained is that of the representation of Venezuela by the Acting Attorney General.2 A dual representation of Venezuela, adds De Jes\u00fas, would give an undue and unfair advantage to Conoco and affect Venezuela's right to a fair trial because of the risk of contradiction in the arguments and manner in which they will be presented.\n\nAccording to Article 50 of the Venezuelan *Ley Org\u00e1nica de la Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica* of 15 March 2019, the Acting Attorney General is the competent Venezuelan authority in charge of the patrimonial interests of Venezuela before national and international courts and tribunals (Annex 2) and the only authority recognized to act by the Constitution of Venezuela (Annex 3).\n\nB. *Curtis*\n-----------\n\n27.\n\nIn its letter to the Committee of 30 March 2020, Curtis replies that the Guaid\u00f3 Government has been recognized by numerous States and International Organizations, but stresses that a decision on the political question of which government has the standing to represent Venezuela in ICSID proceedings cannot be left to the Committee. Curtis invites the Committee to reject the application to change the *status quo* of Venezuela's representation in the annulment proceedings.\n\nC. *The Respondent on Annulment*\n--------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nIn its letter to the Committee of 30 March 2020, Conoco raises the concern of the future difficulties it may face in enforcing the Award, should Venezuela argue that it was not heard properly in the annulment proceedings because of the exclusion of its representative. Conoco invites the Committee not to take a decision that could result in any unnecessary risk, as already different State Parties to the ICSID Convention have recognized different governments of Venezuela. Conoco concludes that the *status quo* should be maintained with the participation of both the Special Attorney General and the Acting Attorney General and their respective representatives, Curtis and De Jes\u00fas.\n\n**III. The Committee's Analysis**\n---------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nAs Conoco recalls3, there is no question that Venezuela is the proper identity of the State applying for annulment in these proceedings. The Parties do not seriously dispute that the Committee, which is neither a political body nor the deliberative organ of an International Organization, cannot hear - and decide - a political question, such as the legitimate government of Venezuela.\n\nLetter of 30 March 2020 \u00b6 11.\n\n30.\n\nThe issue raised before the Committee by De Jes\u00fas pertains to Venezuela's representation in the annulment proceedings. The Committee agrees with De Jes\u00fas4 that the Committee must resolve the matter in accordance with the power it has under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention (applicable *mutatis mutandis* to this annulment procedure before the Committee pursuant to Article 52(4)) which provides, in relevant part:\n\n\"If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\"\n\nLetter of 31 March 2020 \u00b6 4.\n\n31.\n\nIn support of its application, De Jes\u00fas refers to decisions of *ad hoc* committees and arbitral tribunals5 which have decided to maintain the *status quo* of Venezuela's representation by continuing with the counsel on record. The Committee accepts that the *status quo* approach adopted in other ICSID proceedings should also apply in the present annulment proceedings.\n\nICSID cases n\u00b0 ARB/12/21, ARB(AF)/17/1, ARB/13/11, ARB(AF)/18:3, ARB/16/23.\n\n32.\n\nThe Parties agree to an approach based on the *status quo*, but differ as its proper application in the present case. Contrary to the view advocated by De Jes\u00fas that the representation of Venezuela must continue without change under the authority of the *Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica*, Curtis and Conoco maintain that the *status quo* includes the participation of the respective representatives of Curtis for the Special Attorney General and of De Jes\u00fas for the Acting Attorney General.\n\n33.\n\nIt is uncontested that Curtis and De Jes\u00fas have acted as representatives of Venezuela in the underlying arbitration proceedings. De Jes\u00fas is instructed by the Acting Attorney General under a power of attorney of 6 March 2019 notified to the Arbitral Tribunal on 7 March 2019. Curtis is, since the revocation of its power of attorney on 6 March 2019 by the Acting Attorney General, instructed by the Special Attorney General from the beginning of the post-Award proceedings with a power of attorney of 5 April 2019.\n\n34.\n\nCurtis has submitted on 16 April 2019 an Application for Rectification of the Award rendered on 8 March 2019. De Jes\u00fas has filed the same Application on 19 April 2019. The Arbitral Tribunal held in its Decision on Rectification of 24 August 2019:\n\n\"The submission of different documents as powers of attorneys may raise an issue of representation, opposing on two sides law firms both claiming to be the Respondent's representative. However, the true issue before the Tribunal is to identify the Parties, and in particular the Respondent, and to identify its position that must be addressed through the Tribunal's findings. In this respect, the Tribunal is not faced with any conflicting position or submission. Firstly, as both representatives state that they act on behalf of the Respondent, there is no dispute that they represent the same Party, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. There is no other individual or firm claiming any similar power on behalf of Venezuela. Secondly, there is no conflict about the substance of the issues on rectification before the Tribunal. Indeed, on both sides of the representatives declaring to act on behalf of the Respondent, the Application for Rectification is identical to the Request dated 16 April 2019. Therefore, the issue related to the correct designation of the Respondent's representatives is moot and does not require any decision from the Tribunal.\"6\n\n\u00b6 25.\n\n35.\n\nCurtis has filed an Application for Annulment on 27 November 2019. De Jes\u00fas has filed a substantively identical Application on 5 December 2019. Both Applications have been registered by ICSID and transmitted to the Committee. Curtis and De Jes\u00fas have participated at all stages of these annulment proceedings since. The Committee therefore finds that the *status quo* means that Curtis and De Jes\u00fas, who have both been counsel of record in the arbitration phase and in the annulment proceedings, will remain as representatives of Venezuela.\n\n36.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas has however objected to such a situation which, it alleges, would violate Venezuela's right to a fair trial. The Committee considers that it has the power and duty to conduct the process before it in such a way that the parties are treated fairly and with equality and that at any stage of the proceedings each party is given the opportunity to present its case. Both De Jes\u00fas and Curtis aim at the annulment of the Award. As pointed out by De Jes\u00fas, there is a real likelihood that Curtis and De Jes\u00fas make different arguments and present these arguments in a different manner.7 The possibility of such divergences between Curtis and De Jes\u00fas does not mean that their arguments and theses would not be heard and answered, separately as may be, by the Committee. The Committee notes that Conoco, which bears a heavier burden to defend against the lines of arguments that will be raised by Curtis and De Jes\u00fas separately, agrees to respond to submissions from both sets of representatives.8\n\nLetter of 31 March 2020 \u00b6 15.\n\nLetter of 30 March 2020 \u00b6 12.\n\n37.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that maintaining Curtis and De Jes\u00fas as counsel of record accords, at this stage of the proceedings, with procedural fairness.\n\n**IV. Decision**\n----------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Committee decides:\n\n- not to exclude Curtis, instructed by the Special Attorney General, from these proceedings,\n\n- to reject the application of De Jes\u00fas of 15 March 2020.\n\n39.\n\nAll questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Committee and of the Parties in connection with this application are reserved for subsequent determination, together with the Application for Annulment."}, {"Title": "Lord Phillips Recommendation", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2020-07-10T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Lord Phillips Recommendation\n----------------------------\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 8 March 2019 the Tribunal in this arbitration (\"the Arbitration\") dispatched its award1 to the parties.

On 3 February 2020 an *ad hoc* Annulment Committee was appointed consisting of Judge Dominique Hascher, President, Professor Diego P. Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo and Mr. Kap-You Kim (\"the Committee\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 15 March 2020 the Committee received an Application (\"the Exclusion Application\")3 from De Jes\u00fas to exclude the participation of Curtis from the proceeding on the ground that Curtis was not authorized to act for Venezuela.\n\nApplication to Committee from De Jes\u00fas to exclude Curtis dated 15 March 2020, (\"The Exclusion Application\").\n\n5.\n\nOn 3 April 2020 the Committee made an Order4 (\"the Order on Representation\") rejecting this Application.\n\nOrder on Representation dated 3 April 2020.\n\n6.\n\nOn 16 April 2020 the Centre received a Proposal5 from De Jes\u00fas \"on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\" to disqualify all three members of the Committee pursuant to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (\"the Disqualification Proposal\"). Pursuant to Article 58 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 9 it falls to the Chair of the ICSID Administrative Council to decide the Proposal.\n\nThe Disqualification Proposal dated 16 April 2020.\n\n7.\n\nThe Proposal requested that the Secretary-General of ICSID seek a recommendation from a third-party neutral in connection with the Proposal. The Chair of the Administrative Council decided to accede to this request.\n\n8.\n\nOn 11 June 2020 I received a letter6 from the Secretary-General inviting me to make a Recommendation on the Proposal, having previously ascertained that I would be prepared to accept this request. This is that Recommendation.\n\nLetter from Secretary-General dated 10 June 2020.\n\n9.\n\nThe gravamen of the Disqualification Proposal is that the terms of the Order on Representation demonstrate that each of the three members of the Committee cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment, as required by Article 14(1) of the Convention. Accordingly, in order to decide on my Recommendation I shall have to examine the Order on Representation in some detail.\n\n**BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe background to this matter is the political turmoil to which Venezuela has been subjected as a result of the rival claims of Mr. Maduro and Mr. Guaid\u00f3 to be its legitimate President and Head of Government. In a letter of submissions to the Committee dated 30 March 20207 Curtis set out a lengthy list of countries and international institutions that it claimed had recognized the Guaid\u00f3 Government. I have seen no evidence as to the accuracy of that list but will proceed on the basis that some countries have recognized Mr. Maduro as President whilst others have recognized Mr. Guaid\u00f3.\n\nCurtis' letter to Committee dated 30 March 2020.\n\n11.\n\nAccording to the Exclusion Application, on 9 April 2018 De Jes\u00fas began to act as co-counsel in the Arbitration8. It is not alleged, and I have seen no evidence to suggest, that De Jes\u00fas was entered on the record at this time as an addition to Venezuela's legal representation.\n\nThe Exclusion Application, footnote 1.\n\n12.\n\nOn 5 February 2019 the National Assembly of Venezuela passed a Statute (\"the Statute\") that gave Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez power to act as \"*Special Attorney*\" of Venezuela. On 8 February 2019 the Constitutional Chamber of Venezuela's Supreme Court declared this Statute to be *\"null and without any legal effects\"9.*\n\nThe Exclusion Application, p. 2.\n\n13.\n\nOn 6 March 2019 Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza granted a Power of Attorney giving authority to De Jes\u00fas to act in the Arbitration and revoked that which had been granted to Curtis10. The Tribunal was informed of this but Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, or those acting on his instructions, decided not to ask the Tribunal to make any finding in respect of representation11. In consequence the Award, which was dispatched to the parties only two days later, made no mention of this.\n\nThe Exclusion Application, Footnote 1.\n\nThe Exclusion Application p. 3.\n\n14.\n\nOn 27 March 2019 Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez wrote to the Secretary-General of ICSID12, contending that by virtue of the Statute he was the only legitimate representative of Venezuela. ICSID declined to resolve the issue that this letter raised as to who was authorized to act in arbitration proceedings for the Republic of Venezuela, but referred this question to the individual Tribunals and Committees in ICSID arbitrations or arbitral proceedings to which Venezuela was party13.\n\nMr. Hern\u00e1ndez' letter of 27 March 2019.\n\nThe Exclusion Application, p. 2.\n\n15.\n\nOn 5 April 2019 Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez granted to Curtis a Power of Attorney to represent Venezuela in this arbitration14.\n\nDecision on Rectification, para. 9.\n\n16.\n\nOn 29 April 2019 Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez wrote a further letter to the Secretary-General, expanding on his earlier letter.15\n\nMr. Hern\u00e1ndez' letter of 29 April 2019.\n\n17.\n\nIn a number of cases, where De Jes\u00fas was recorded as acting for Venezuela under authority conferred by Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, the relevant Tribunal or Committee decided that this should remain the position16.\n\nThe Exclusion Application p. 2.\n\n18.\n\nIn its Decision on Rectification the Tribunal referred to the dispute as to which lawyers were authorized to act for Venezuela, but decided that it did not need to resolve this.\n\n19.\n\nIn its Order on Representation the Committee concluded that\n\n*\"[...]maintaining Curtis and De Jes\u00fas as counsel of record accords, at this stage of the proceedings, with procedural fairness\"* and, accordingly decided *\"not to exclude Curtis, instructed by the Special Attorney General, from these proceedings\"* and *\"to reject the application of De Jes\u00fas of 15 March17.\"*\n\nOrder on Representation, paras. 37 and 38.\n\n20.\n\nOn 9 April 2020 Dr. De Jes\u00fas wrote requesting the Committee to revisit the Order on Representation. On 15 April 2020 the Committee communicated to the parties its decision not to alter its Order18. It added:\n\n*\"The Committee wishes to draw the parties' attention to the Order of April 3, 2020, which is limited to the present stage of the proceedings and is subject to review in light of future developments.\"*\n\nEmail from Francisco Grob dated 15 April 2020.\n\n**MR. HERN\u00c1NDEZ LETTERS OF 27 MARCH 2019 AND 29 APRIL 2019**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn his letter of 27 March 2019 Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez wrote in his *\"capacity as Special Attorney General\"* of Venezuela. He went on to state:\n\n\"*As you are aware, since January 10, 2019 Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ceased to hold office as President of Venezuela and therefore he does not have any authority to represent or to act on behalf of Venezuela. In addition, pursuant to article 15, literal \"b\" of the Statute that Governs the Transition to Democracy to Restablish the Full Force and Effect of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\u2026the judicial representation of the Republic of Venezuela, including in arbitral proceedings, is vested exclusively on me, in my capacity as Special Attorney general of Venezuela, appointed by the Interim President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela acting under the control of the Venezuelan National Assembly.*\"\n\n22.\n\nIn his letter of 29 April 2019 Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez contended that the international representation of the Venezuelan State was a matter for ICSID to decide as it was not a mere procedural issue that could be determined by arbitral tribunals and committees. He added19:\n\n\"*I am aware that some of those decisions of the National Assembly have been declared \"null\" by Maduro's Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court. However this Court is not recognized as a legitimate body of the Venezuelan State\u2026*\"\n\nMr. Hern\u00e1ndez' letter of 29 April 2019, para. 6.\n\n**DECISIONS IN OTHER ICSID PROCEEDINGS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nIn its Order on Representation20 the Committee states that it\n\n\"*accepts that the 'status quo' approach adopted in other ICSID proceedings should also apply in the present annulment proceedings.*\"\n\nOrder on Representation, para. 31\n\n24.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas submits that the Committee has failed correctly to apply the *status quo\"* approach. Accordingly I propose to consider at this point the approach taken in these other ICSID proceedings where the correct representation of Venezuela was in issue as a result of Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez' letter of 27 March 2019.\n\n**Air Canada v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela21**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/17/1, Procedural Order No. 7.\n\n25.\n\nAt the outset of this Arbitration on 14 March 2017 Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, described in Procedural Order No. 7 as Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica instructed De Jes\u00fas to represent Venezuela and De Jes\u00fas was placed on the record as so doing.22\n\n*Id*., para. 3, (referencing Procedural Order No. 1 Section 9.1).\n\n26.\n\nThe letter from Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez of 27 March 2019 led the Tribunal to review the representation of Venezuela in the Arbitration.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal held that it had to resolve the following procedural issue:\n\n\"*whether it may continue the present proceedings with Respondent's interests being represented by Respondent's Counsel on record, who at least until 4 February 2019, were indisputably the valid representatives of Venezuela.*23\"\n\n*Id*., paras. 60 and 65.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal observed that the challenge to the representation on the record related to a political and constitutional question that was beyond the authority and jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n\"*If, and until, there is a decision on this question by an appropriate decision-making body, this Tribunal shall refrain from taking a decision on who holds the proper representation of Respondent*24*.*\"\n\n*Id*., para. 64.\n\n29.\n\nThis finding as to jurisdiction accorded with submissions made by Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez and by De Jes\u00fas, described by the Tribunal as \"the Respondent\". The Tribunal implicitly rejected the submission made by the Claimant that the issue should be determined according to French law as the *lex arbitri,* and that this would lead to the conclusion that Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez was the proper representative of Venezuela, because France recognized the Presidency of Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez25.\n\n*Id*., paras. 40-44, 62.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to hold that, as the only challenge to the representation on the record was based on political and constitutional grounds that the Tribunal had no authority to resolve, there was no obstacle to continuing with the representatives of Venezuela on record, namely Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza and De Jes\u00fas26.\n\n*Id*., para. 66.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal observed:\n\n\"*There is no reason or legal basis to continue, as Claimant suggests, with two different Counsel of Respondent. In fact, this avenue could create practical difficulties, particularly in the event of disagreements between the Counsel*27*.*\"\n\n*Id*., para. 68.\n\n**Valores Mundiales, S.L. and Consorcio Andino, S.L. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela28**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/13/11.\n\n32.\n\nThe relevant decision is that of the Committee in Annulment Proceedings. The Award itself recorded Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, the Attorney General for Venezuela, and his counsel, Mr. Wray of Foley Hoag LLP, as representing Venezuela. The Committee adopted a somewhat different approach to that of the Tribunal in *Air Canada.*\n\n33.\n\nThe Committee held that it had no authority to decide, *erga omnes,* who was Venezuela's legitimate representative. Its task was more limited, namely to determine who might express himself on behalf of Venezuela in the annulment proceedings29.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/13/11, Procedural Order No. 2, para. 31.\n\n34.\n\nThe Committee held, nonetheless, that to resolve the procedural question it had to address the position under both Venezuelan domestic law and international law30. On both, the burden of proof was on Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez31. The intervening persons (i.e., those other than Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez) had concentrated their arguments on Venezuelan domestic law and said nothing about international law32.\n\n*Id*., para. 39.\n\n*Id*., para. 40.\n\n*Id*., para. 44.\n\n35.\n\nThe Committee held that Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez failed to establish his case under Venezuelan domestic law because the Statute on which he relied had been declared null and void by the Supreme Court of Justice33.\n\n*Id*., para. 45.\n\n36.\n\nThis was not, however, the end of the matter. The Committee went on to hold that it could not deviate from what had been decided by Venezuela's highest judicial body \"*unless it is proved that there has been a change of government according to international law*\" *34.* To prove this Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez had to establish that *\"in the reality of the facts, whoever controls the Venezuelan territory, as the current authority, is the government of the president of the National Assembly* (i.e. Mr. Guaid\u00f3)35.\n\n*Id*., para. 47.\n\n*Id*., para. 48.\n\n37.\n\nMr. Hern\u00e1ndez had failed to prove this. The issue could not be determined simply by the number of States that had recognized Mr. Guaid\u00f3 as President36. Accordingly the proceedings had to continue under the representation of Venezuela already established on the record37. The Committee added:\n\n\"*The Committee clarifies that, just as a change to the representation is not justified, neither can it grant the Respondents in the Annulment's suggestion to continue the proceedings with two different representations on behalf of Venezuela. There is no legal or logical basis that would allow the Committee to, on the one hand, deny Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez exclusive representation of Venezuela because he has not established to have such authority and, on the other, accept that he shares said representation with the Litigation Manager*38.\"\n\n*Id*., para. 49.\n\n*Id*., para. 51.\n\n*Id*., para. 50.\n\n**Kimberly-Clark Dutch Holdings, B.V. and Kimberly-Clark BVBA v Venezuela39**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/18/3.\n\n38.\n\nAs the Tribunal found in its Order on Venezuela's Representation, when this arbitration was commenced in 2018 the Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica, instructed De Jes\u00fas to represent Venezuela40. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez' letter of 27 March 2019 caused the Tribunal to review Venezuela's representation. The Tribunal framed the issue before it as follows:\n\n\"*The Respondent in this arbitration is the State of Venezuela, not a particular government purporting to act on behalf of the State. Therefore the question before the Tribunal is not who the proper party to this arbitration is. It is merely which lawyers can represent Venezuela's interests in this arbitration.[\u2026] In other words it is a procedural issue. What is more, as a practical matter, it is a procedural matter that the Tribunal must resolve, because the arbitration cannot proceed with two representatives of one and the same party who are in conflict with each other.*\"\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/18/3, Order on Venezuela's Representation, para. 4.\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal discharged this duty with brief findings:\n\n\"*The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the submissions and accompanying documents on Venezuela's representation. It has been unable to discern any argument or evidence that would lead it to change the representation of Venezuela in this arbitration as it has been in effect since April 2018.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*On this basis the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that, at this stage, the arbitration must continue with counsel of record for Venezuela*41*.*\"\n\n*Id*., paras. 49 and 51.\n\n**Agroinsumos Ibero-Americanos, S.L. and others v Venezuela42**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/16/23.\n\n40.\n\nThe short decision of this Tribunal reached a conclusion that was almost a carbon copy of the previous one:\n\n\"*After reviewing Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez communications, the arguments of each of the parties and the evidence made available to it, the Tribunal does not find sufficient evidence to conclude that there has been, for the exclusive purposes of this arbitration, a change to the powers of representation of the Respondent in this arbitration.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*In view of the above, the Tribunal decides to maintain the 'status quo' of the representation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in this arbitration*43*.*\"\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/16/23, Procedural Order No. 13, paras. 17, 18.\n\n**F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. v Venezuela44**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/12/21.\n\n41.\n\nThis was a very short decision of an Annulment Committee, of which Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo was a member:\n\n\"*Until now, Respondent has been represented by the persons appointed for such purpose by the Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica as required by the domestic law of the Respondent.*\n\n*After giving to all involved the opportunity to fully present their positions, the Committee finds that the evidence on record does not justify a change in the 'status quo'. For this reason, and taking into account considerations of fairness to both Parties and efficiency of the proceedings, the Committee sees no basis to hold that, for purposes of this annulment proceeding, the representation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has changed.*\"\n\n**THE RECTIFICATION PROCEEDINGS**\n---------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Rectification Proceedings played a significant part in the reasoning of the Committee and I propose to examine them at this stage. I start with a summary of the proceedings taken from the Decision on Rectification itself.\n\n43.\n\nOn 16 April 2019 Curtis submitted to the Centre an Application for Rectification pursuant to Arbitration Rule 4, purporting to act for Venezuela. Curtis included the Power of Attorney issued by Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez on 5 April 2019. On 18 April 2019 the Secretary-General registered the request.\n\n44.\n\nOn 19 April 2019 De Jes\u00fas wrote to the Secretary-General, attaching Curtis' Application for Rectification and the Notice of Registration of this and requesting its registration. The letter referred to the Power of Attorney issued by Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza on 6 March 2019, conferring authority on de Jes\u00fas and revoking that of Curtis.\n\n45.\n\nOn 20 April 2019 the Claimants wrote to the Secretary-General consenting to the Tribunal addressing the points raised in the Application for Rectification. The Claimants added that, in the light of their consent, the Tribunal could carry out its task of reviewing the Award without deciding the issue of representation of Venezuela.\n\n46.\n\nOn 9 May 2019 De Jes\u00fas wrote to the Secretary General a letter about representation that attached a power of representation in favour of De Jes\u00fas and of Dentons Europe SC LLP, signed by Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza on 29 April 2019.\n\n47.\n\nOn 10 May 2019 the Claimants sent a letter in which, *inter alia*, they suggested that, as both declared representatives of the Republic had submitted the same Application, the Tribunal need not address any issues relating to the Respondent's representation45.\n\nParas 44 to 48 are taken from the Decision on Rectification.\n\n48.\n\nThis submission found favour with the Tribunal. In its Decision on Rectification it stated46:\n\n\"*The submission of different documents as powers of attorneys may raise an issue of representation, opposing on two sides law firms both claiming to be the Respondent's representative. However, the true issue before the Tribunal is to identify the Parties, and in particular the Respondent, and to identify its position that must be addressed through the Tribunal's findings. In this respect, the Tribunal is not faced with any conflicting position or submission. Firstly, as both representatives state that they act on behalf of the Respondent, there is no dispute that they represent the same Party, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. There is no other individual or firm claiming any similar power on behalf of Venezuela. Secondly there is no conflict about the substance of the issues on rectification before the Tribunal. Indeed, on both sides of the representatives declaring to act on behalf of the Respondent, the Application for Rectification is identical to the Request dated 16 April 2019. Therefore, the issue related to the correct designation of the Respondent's representatives is moot and does not require any decision from the Tribunal.*\"\n\nDecision on Rectification, para. 25.\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to state that the list of \"Parties' representatives\" in the Decision on Rectification did not imply a decision in relation to the legal questions submitted to the Tribunal in respect of representation47. The Tribunal went on to rule on the substantive issues raised by the Application for Rectification.\n\n*Id*., para. 26.\n\n**THE APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT**\n---------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nOn 27 November 2019 the Centre received from Mr. Kahale of Curtis an Application for Annulment of the Award. On 5 December 2019 the Centre received a second Application for Annulment of the Award in essentially identical form. This was submitted by Dr. Alfredo Jes\u00fas O. and was signed by Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza.\n\n51.\n\nOn 16 December 2019 the Centre wrote to all concerned stating that the Application for Annulment had been registered.\n\n52.\n\nOn 3 February 2020 the Committee was constituted. On the following day Conoco wrote opposing a request made by Venezuela for the continuance of a stay of enforcement of the Award and proposing a briefing schedule. On 5 February 2020 the Committee invited Venezuela to respond.\n\n53.\n\nOn 11 February 2020 Curtis rejected the Claimants' proposed schedule and proposed instead 16 March for Venezuela's response.\n\n54.\n\nOn 12 February 2020 De Jes\u00fas proposed the same day for Venezuela's response.\n\n55.\n\nOn 18 February 2020 the Committee fixed 16 March 2020 for Venezuela's response in relation to the stay of enforcement of the Award. On 20 February 2020 the Committee circulated a draft procedural order. The Claimants and De Jes\u00fas responded to this on 13 March and Curtis responded on 14 March. De Jes\u00fas made the Exclusion Application on the following day48.\n\nParas. 52 to 57 are taken from the Order on Representation.\n\n**THE EXCLUSION APPLICATION**\n-----------------------------\n\n**The Application**\n-------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Exclusion Application was made by Dr. Alfredo de Jes\u00fas O. in a letter to the Committee dated 15 March 2020. This complained that the exercise of conferring on a proposed draft procedural order had been disturbed by *\"the interference of a third party\",* namely Curtis. The basis of the Application was that under Article 50 of the *Ley Org\u00e1nica de la Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica* Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, as acting Attorney General, was in charge of the representation of Venezuela before national and international courts and tribunals. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza had revoked Curtis' authority on 6 March 2019. Curtis had invoked a power of attorney issued by Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, who asserted authority as *Special Attorney General* under a Statute issued by the National Assembly on 5 February 2019. That Statute had, however, been declared *\"null and without any legal effect\"* by the Venezuelan Supreme Court on 8 February 2019. All other ICSID Tribunals or Committees that had considered Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez' assertion of authority had resolved to *\"maintain the status quo of the representation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela under the authority of Acting Attorney General Munoz Pedroza\".*\n\n**Curtis' Response**\n--------------------\n\n57.\n\nCurtis responded in a lengthy letter dated 30 March2020. This argued that it had been common ground on the part of De Jes\u00fas, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez and the various ICSID Tribunals and Committees that the latter had no jurisdiction to decide the political questions of recognition of the government of Venezuela and who had the right to represent Venezuela in legal proceedings49. That was a matter for the appropriate national or international authorities. The United States recognized the government of Mr. Guaid\u00f3, of which Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez was a member. If Mr. Guaid\u00f3's representative were excluded from the proceedings any award would be rendered illegitimate and unenforceable in a United States Court50. Mr. De Jes\u00fas was now seeking to depart from this common ground and to get the Committee involved in the political question of who had proper authority to make decisions for Venezuela in this case. The correct course was to follow the example of the Tribunals and Committees and preserve the *status quo.* This approach led to the recognition of the authority of Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, for Curtis had acted for Venezuela under this authority from the beginning of the post-Award proceedings51.\n\nCurtis' Letter of 30 March 2020, para. 1.\n\n*Id*., para. 2.\n\n*Id.,* para. 19.\n\n**Conoco's Response**\n---------------------\n\n58.\n\nConoco's lawyers, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP (\"Freshfields\") and Three Crowns, also responded on 30 March. Conoco took no position on the issue of principle of who was authorized to act for Venezuela in this arbitration and submitted that there was no need for the Committee to do so either. The correct approach was to preserve the *status quo* by permitting the continued participation of both the Special Attorney General and the Acting Attorney General and their respective representatives. This approach was in line with the prior cases. In all those cases recognition of the authority of Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez would have involved a change of the *status quo,* as he had no antecedent standing in any of them. In the present case the Special Attorney General and the Acting Attorney General had been working side by side for nearly a year, without complaint from anyone.\n\n59.\n\nConoco lawyers' letter then set out what were said to be the benefits of this course. Different Member States of the ICSID Convention recognized different governments of Venezuela. Having representation of both governments would avoid the risk of an enforcement court declining to recognize the outcome of this arbitration on the ground that Venezuela had not been validly represented. Such an approach would involve no prejudice to Venezuela.\n\n**De Jes\u00fas' Reply**\n-------------------\n\n60.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas replied vigorously to these responses in a letter of 31 March 2020. Two broad themes emerge from this. (i) Curtis and Conoco have advanced a political approach to the issue of representation rather than grapple with *\"the merits of the legal issue raised by the Republic following a legal approach52\".* (ii) While purporting to follow a principle of preserving the *status quo*, Curtis and Conoco have erred in the manner in which they apply this principle. They have focused on the position in the period after the making of the Award, when Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez and his representative have been involved, rather than upholding the *status quo* that has persisted from the outset of the Arbitration under which Venezuela's representatives were Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza and those he appointed to represent Venezuela, in accordance with the authority that he enjoyed under the domestic law of Venezuela53.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' letter of 31 March 2020, para. 2.\n\n*Id*., paras. 6, 8, 9, 14.\n\n61.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas also joins issue with Conoco's suggestion that dual representation would not prejudice Venezuela, arguing that this would involve *\"a real risk of contradiction in the arguments and in the manner in which they will be presented54\".*\n\n*Id*., para. 15.\n\n**THE ORDER ON REPRESENTATION**\n-------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe relevant parts of the Committee's decision on representation are sufficiently concise to be quoted verbatim:\n\n*29\u2026The Parties do not seriously dispute that the Committee, which is neither a political body nor the deliberative organ of an International Organization, cannot hear \u2013 and decide \u2013 a political question, such as the legitimate Government of Venezuela.*\n\n*30. The issue raised before the Committee by de Jes\u00fas pertains to Venezuela's representation in the annulment proceedings. The Committee agrees with De Jes\u00fas that the Committee must resolve the matter in accordance with the power it has under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention (applicable 'mutatis mutandis' to this annulment procedure before the Committee pursuant to Article 52(4)) which provides, in relevant part:*\n\n*\"If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question\"*\n\n*31. In support of its application, De Jes\u00fas refers to decisions of ad hoc committees and arbitral tribunals which have decided to maintain the 'status quo' of Venezuela's representation by continuing with the counsel on record. The Committee accepts that the 'status quo' approach adopted in other ICSID proceedings should also apply in the present annulment proceedings.*\n\n*32. The Parties agree to an approach based on the 'status quo', but differ as its proper application in the present case. Contrary to the view advocated by De Jes\u00fas that the representation of Venezuela must continue without change under the authority of the Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica, Curtis and Conoco maintain that the status quo includes the participation of the respective representatives of Curtis for the Special Attorney General and of De Jes\u00fas for the Acting Attorney General.*\n\n[The Committee then traces the joint participation of Curtis and De Jes\u00fas from 6 March 2019 to 15 March 2010]\n\n*35 [\u2026] The Committee therefore finds that the status quo means that Curtis and De Jes\u00fas who have both been counsel of record in the arbitration phase and in the annulment proceedings, will remain as representatives of Venezuela.*\n\n*36. De Jes\u00fas has however objected to such a situation which, it alleges, would violate Venezuela's right to a fair trial The Committee considers that it has the power and duty to conduct the process before it in such a way that the parties are treated fairly and with equality and that at any stage of the proceedings each party is given the opportunity to present its case. Both de Jes\u00fas and Curtis aim at the annulment of the Award. As pointed out by De Jes\u00fas, there is a real likelihood that Curtis and De Jes\u00fas make different arguments and present these arguments in a different manner. The possibility of such divergences between Curtis and De Jes\u00fas does not mean that their arguments and theses would not be heard and answered, separately as may be, by the Committee. The Committee notes that Conoco, which bears a heavier burden to defend against the lines of argument that will be raised by Curtis and De Jes\u00fas separately, agrees to respond to submissions from both sets of representatives.*\n\n*37. The Committee therefore concludes that maintaining Curtis and De Jes\u00fas as counsel of record accords, at this stage of the proceedings, with procedural fairness.*\n\n**THE REQUEST TO THE COMMITTEE TO REVISIT ITS DECISION**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nOn 9 April 2020 De Jes\u00fas wrote to the Committee inviting it to reconsider its decision on the ground that it lacked a legal basis as it disregarded Venezuelan law and ignored the relevant facts55. Under the Venezuelan National Constitution and the Organic Law of the Attorney General's Office the only organ empowered to represent the Republic in international proceedings was the *Procuradur\u00eda General*, currently under the authority of Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza. The *Procurador Especial* had no standing under Venezuelan law because the Statute creating that office had been declared to be null and void by the Supreme Court56.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Request to revisit Order on the Representation, page 1.\n\n*Id*., pages 3,4.\n\n64.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas submitted that the Committee's purported *status quo* analysis was flawed in that it failed to have regard to the only relevant *status quo.* This was the authority of the *Procurador\u00eda General* to represent the Republic. The factual matters that the Committee had considered, such as the persons appearing as \"counsel of record\", were irrelevant57.\n\n*Id*., page 7.\n\n65.\n\nThe Committee declined to alter its Order58. In doing so it conveyed the following comment:\n\n\"*The Committee wishes to draw the parties' attention to the Order of April 3, 2020, which is limited to the present stage of the proceedings and is subject to review in light of future developments. Should this be the case in the future, there would be further opportunity to renew the contents of the April 9 letter with other arguments as they may be.*\"\n\nEmail from Francisco Grob dated 15 April 2020.\n\n**THE DISQUALIFICATION PROPOSAL**\n---------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nIt is De Jes\u00fas' case that the Order on Representation is so egregiously defective as to demonstrate that all three members of the Committee responsible for it lack the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. De Jes\u00fas further submit that there are matters individual to Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo that demonstrate that each is incapable of exercising an independent judgment. In consequence De Jes\u00fas submit that all three must be disqualified.\n\n**Relevant law**\n----------------\n\n67.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"*[a] party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.*\"\n\n68.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the Convention provides:\n\n\"*Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.*\"\n\n69.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas submit that in the ICSID context \"*independence\"* of arbitrators \u2013 and by extension of Annulment Committee Members- is to be understood as \"*the absence of the influence of external factors in their consideration of the case, different from the facts, arguments and evidence presented by the Parties and their merit*59.\"\n\nProposal for Disqualification, para. 17.\n\n70.\n\nThis submission appears to be founded on two sentences, repeated in a number of the decisions cited by De Jes\u00fas, including earlier Proposals to Disqualify Arbitrators in this Arbitration:\n\n\"*Impartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition towards a party. Independence is characterized by the absence of external control. Independence and impartiality both 'protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case*60*.*\"\n\nDecision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority in this Arbitration, dated 5 May 2014, at para. 51; see also Decision on Proposal to Disqualify L Yves Fortier Q.C. in this Arbitration, dated 27 February 2012, paras. 54, 55; Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal in this Arbitration dated 1 July 2015 at para. 81; Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify all Members of the Arbitral Tribunal in *Mobil v Argentine* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/16 at para. 35.\n\n71.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas have incorrectly conflated these two sentences to produce the proposition that an arbitrator who takes into account a factor that is not material to the merits of the case lacks independence. This is fallacious.\n\n72.\n\nThat said, I have no difficulty with the remainder of De Jes\u00fas' submissions of law. These are that the *independence* standard of Article 14 has been interpreted to encompass both independence *and* impartiality, and the Spanish version of the Convention expressly refers to impartial judgment in place of independent judgment. It follows that the requirement is that Annulment Committee members are required to be both impartial and independent61. A successful challenge to the independence and impartiality of a member of a Tribunal or Committee does not require the establishment of actual dependence or bias. An *appearance* of dependence or bias will suffice62.\n\nProposal for Disqualification, paras. 17 and 18.\n\n*Id*., para 19.\n\n73.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas cite the majority of the Tribunal ruling on an Application for the Disqualification of the third member of the Tribunal in *Suez Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v Argentina63.* This *correctly* defined independence and impartiality64:\n\n\"*The concepts of independence and impartiality, though related, are often seen as distinct, although the precise nature of the distinction is not always easy to grasp. Generally speaking independence relates to the lack of relations with a party that might influence an arbitrator's decision. Impartiality, on the other hand, concerns the absence of a bias or predisposition toward one of the parties.*\"\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Additional Observations, pp. 3-4.\n\nICSID Cases ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/19, Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal, para 29.\n\n**De Jes\u00fas' case**\n------------------\n\n74.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas submit that the Committee's approach to the issue of representation constituted such a *\"blatant deviation from their mission*65 as to demonstrate, or at least give the appearance of, a manifest lack of independence and impartiality on the part of all three members.\n\nProposal for Disqualification, para 8.\n\n75.\n\nThe gravamen of the criticism advanced by De Jes\u00fas is as follows. The issue of representation fell to be determined according to the domestic law of Venezuela. The Committee made no attempt to apply legal reasoning. Instead it abandoned \"*all legal reasoning in favor of a political solution\"* that appeared to the Committee to be \"*practical*\" or \"*convenient*\"66*.* The position is summarised as follows67:\n\n\"*In sum in its Order on Representation, the Committee invoked one procedural rule in order to establish its inherent powers to resolve the matter at hand (Article 44 of the ICSID Convention). The Committee failed to analyze or invoke a single provision of Venezuelan law, the only applicable law to the issue of representation of the Republic and contented itself to mention a set of irrelevant facts to the issue.*\"\n\n*Id*., paras. 19, 20, 23, 24, 26, 29, 32, 34.\n\n*Id*., para. 29.\n\n76.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas submit that by failing to apply Venezuelan law\n\n\"*the Committee transformed its decision into an instance of recognition and legitimacy for Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez and his pretended capacity to act in representation of the Republic*68*.*\"\n\n*Id*., para. 32.\n\n77.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas expresses concern at the Committee's remark, when confirming its Order on Representation, that its decision was *\"subject to review in light of future developments\".* This could only apply to future *political* developments, confirming the fact that the Committee had impermissibly had regard to these, rather than to the law.\n\n78.\n\nSo far as Judge Hascher is concerned, De Jes\u00fas submit that the adverse inference that a reasonable and objective observer would draw from the terms of the Order on Representation would be reinforced by Judge Hascher's position as a Judge of the French *Cour de Cassation*69*.* As such, Judge Hascher was subject to the guidelines issued by the *Conseil Superior de la Magistrature.* These prohibited judges from\n\n\"*showing any hostility towards the principle and form of the Government of the Republic, as well as any political demonstration that is incompatible with the restraint that their role requires\".* [This required Judge Hascher to] *\"show deference to the French Government of the Republic and refrain from expressing political opinions that would be incompatible with his position*70*.*\"\n\n*Id*., para. 36.\n\n*Id*., para. 39.\n\n79.\n\nOn 31 March 2020 the United States published *A Democratic Transition Framework for Venezuela.* On 3 April 2020 a press briefing by the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs made it public that the French Government adhered to this. De Jes\u00fas submit that, by reason of Judge Hascher's position as a French Judge, this would be perceived by the reasonable onlooker as having influenced him to disregard Venezuelan law and to reach a decision on representation that was compatible with the political position of the French Government71.\n\n*Id*., paras. 37-39.\n\n80.\n\nSo far as Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo is concerned, as a member of the Annulment Committee in the *F\u00e1brica de Vidrios* case, Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo had been party to the decision that held that there was no justification for departing from the position under which the \"*Respondent has been represented by the persons appointed for such purpose by the Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica, as required by the domestic law of Respondent*\"*.* The \"*only reasonable explanation*\" for the Professor's adoption of \"*a diametrically different solution*\" in the present case was that he had \"*allowed himself to be influenced by factors external to the case, of a political nature, thus compromising his ability to exercise independent judgment*72*.*\"\n\n*Id*., paras. 46-55.\n\n**RESPONSES TO THE DISQUALIFICATION PROPOSAL**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nApart from disassociating themselves from De Jes\u00fas' application, Curtis made no substantive submissions in relation to this73.\n\nLetter from Curtis to ICSID dated 24 April 2020.\n\n82.\n\nOn behalf of Conoco, Freshfields, Three Crowns and Mr. D. Brian King submitted that the application was frivolous and should be rejected74. The Committee had reasonably decided to maintain the *status quo* \u2013 specifically the continued participation of both the Special Attorney General and the Acting Attorney general and their respective representatives75. The requirement to demonstrate a *\"manifest\"* lack of the requisite qualities imposed a heavy burden on De Jes\u00fas to identify objective facts that made bias highly probable76.\n\nConoco lawyers' letter to ICSID dated 24 April 2020, para. 1.\n\n*Id*., para. 7.\n\n*Id*., paras. 9 and 10.\n\n83.\n\nConoco's lawyers submitted that dissatisfaction with the outcome of the Exclusion Application, even if justified, provided no grounds for discrimination. In the event the Committee's decision was correct. It followed the approach to representation of the other Tribunals and Committees, namely the preservation of the *status quo* \u2013 in this case the participation of both the Special Attorney General and the Acting Attorney General77. So far as the specific challenge in respect of Judge Hascher was concerned, there was no merit in this and it should, in any event, be dismissed because it was not made promptly78. So far as the specific challenge in respect of Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo was concerned, inconsistency between decisions in two different cases was no ground for disqualification, but no such inconsistency existed. In each case the decision had been to preserve the *status quo* in respect of representation79. Conoco's lawyers annexed a substantial body of authorities in support of its submissions.\n\n*Id*., paras. 13, 14\n\n*Id*., para. 16.\n\n*Id*., para. 17.\n\n84.\n\nEach of the three Members of the Committee sent to ICSID a short re-assertion of his independence and impartiality without condescending to address the detailed submissions made by De Jes\u00fas.\n\n**DE JES\u00daS' OBSERVATIONS ON THE RESPONSES**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nOn 8 May 2020 De Jes\u00fas sent to ICSID its observations on the responses of the Members of the Committee and Conoco. This asserted that adverse inference should be drawn in the case of each Member of the Committee from his failure to address the detail of De Jes\u00fas' Disqualification Proposal. De Jes\u00fas accepted the submissions of Conoco's lawyers as to the test to be applied to disqualification of the Members of the Committee but differed as to the consequence of the application of that test.\n\n**ANALYSIS**\n------------\n\n**The Disqualification Proposal**\n---------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nArticle 57 permits a proposal for disqualification *\"on account of any fact\"* that indicates a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1). While certain specific facts are relied upon in the challenges made in respect of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, the essence of the case made against all three members of the Committee is based on inferences to be drawn from alleged deficiencies in their Order on Representation. An applicant that seeks to prove from the terms of a decision alone that those who made it were not merely wrong but were, or appear to have been, manifestly lacking in the requisite independence or impartiality has a heavy burden to discharge.\n\n87.\n\nWhere lack of impartiality is alleged against a member of a Tribunal this is usually on the basis that he is, or appears to be, biased in favour of, or against, one of the parties to the Arbitration. In this case the allegation arises in the context of a dispute as to who should be permitted to represent Venezuela in the Application for the Annulment of the Arbitration. The alleged lack of independence and impartiality in this instance arises in relation to a contest between two rival contenders in that dispute \u2013 Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza and Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez. The lack of independence, or the appearance of this, is alleged to be manifested by the decision in relation to that dispute.\n\n**The nature of the decisions on representation**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nIn this, and in other arbitrations where the issue has arisen as to Venezuela's representation, the Tribunal or Committee has given consideration to the basis on which it has power to resolve that issue. The issue arises in circumstances where there are two rival contenders to the Presidency of Venezuela, Mr. Maduro and Mr. Guaid\u00f3. It is, or may be arguable, that if Mr. Maduro is the rightful President Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, as his Attorney General has authority to conduct legal proceedings on behalf of Venezuela but if Mr. Guaid\u00f3 is the rightful President, that authority vests in Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez as his Special Attorney General80.\n\nSee paras. 21 and 22 above.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunals and Committees have agreed that they have no jurisdiction to make a decision that binds anyone as to which is the legitimate government of Venezuela, or lawful representative of that government in this arbitration. They have equally agreed that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, as applicable to Committees pursuant to Article 52(4), gives them the power, and indeed the duty, to decide whom *they shall treat* as the representatives of Venezuela in the proceedings. This is because that question is one of procedure and Article 44 provides:\n\n\"*\u2026If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.*\"\n\n90.\n\nThus, in all these cases, the decision on representation has been treated as resolving a procedural, not substantive issue. The Tribunals and Committees have not purported to determine who, as a matter of law, is entitled to represent Venezuela. They have been concerned with the procedural question of whom they will permit to make representations on behalf of Venezuela. The question that has plainly, and understandably, caused difficulty for the Tribunals and Committees in respect of this question, when faced with competing claims, has been how to resolve it. On analysis it is apparent that they have not all adopted the same approach.\n\n91.\n\nThere has been agreement as to the burden of proof on this issue. Tribunals and Committees have agreed that, where a representative of Venezuela has already been recognized and placed on the record, the onus is on any subsequent rival to demonstrate that the representation should be altered in his favour.\n\n92.\n\nIn the *Air Canada* case the Tribunal held that the only \"an appropriate decision-making body\" could decide who held the proper representation of Venezuela. That was a political issue that the Tribunal had no authority to resolve. As this political issue was the only objection raised to the existing representation and this was not an issue within the competence of the Tribunal, there was no impediment to proceeding with the existing representation.\n\n93.\n\nIn the *Valores Mundiales* case the Committee held that it had no authority to reach a decision binding others (*erga omnes)* as to who was Venezuela's legitimate representative but that this was a matter on which it would have to reach its own decision in order to resolve the procedural issue as to who should express himself on behalf of Venezuela within the framework of the annulment proceedings.\n\n94.\n\nTo do this the Committee had to take into account the interaction between international law and Venezuelan domestic law, as well as the role performed by the burden of proof81. The burden of proof lay on Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, as he was seeking to change the *status quo*82*.*\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/13/11, Procedural Order No. 2, para. 39.\n\n*Id*., para. 40.\n\n95.\n\nAs a matter of Venezuelan domestic law Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez failed to make good his case as the Statute on which he relied had been declared null and void by the Supreme Court83. This was conclusive unless it was proved that there had been a change of government under international law84. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez had asserted, but failed to prove, such a change. He had demonstrated recognition of Mr. Guaid\u00f3 by a number of States, but this did not suffice under international law in the absence of proof of material acts of exercise of power by Mr. Guaid\u00f385.\n\n*Id*., para. 45.\n\n*Id*., para. 47.\n\n*Id*., paras. 48, 49.\n\n96.\n\nIn these circumstances Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez had failed to prove his standing to represent Venezuela and the proceedings had to continue under the existing representation86.\n\n*Id*., para. 51.\n\n97.\n\nIn the *Kimberly-Clark* case*,* the Tribunal recited the submission of the parties, including Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, and concluded simply, without detailed reasoning, that it had discerned no argument or evidence that would lead it to change the existing representation.\n\n98.\n\nThe decisions in the *Agroinsumos* and the *F\u00e1brica de Vidrios* cases were to like effect.\n\n99.\n\nThe position in the Rectification Proceedings differed from all these cases. Curtis had been on the record as the law firm that represented Venezuela up to the time of the award and initiated the Rectification Proceedings. Thereafter both he and De Jes\u00fas acted in tandem in those proceedings, without resolution as to who should be treated as entitled to represent Venezuela. In the end the Tribunal found it unnecessary to take a decision on the matter. Both firms were recorded as representing Venezuela, as was Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, who had been on the record throughout the proceedings, but the Tribunal made it plain that this should not imply that the it had determined who was entitled to represent Venezuela.\n\n**The approach of the Committee**\n---------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nIn the Order on Representation the Committee states that it *\"accepts that the status quo approach adopted in the other ICSID proceedings should also apply in the present annulment proceedings\".* In applying that approach the Committee has held that it is appropriate to consider the *status quo* that has persisted in relation to the parties legal representatives since the start of the post Award proceedings, Curtis appearing pursuant to a power of attorney granted by Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez and De Jes\u00fas pursuant to a power of attorney granted by Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza.\n\n**The case for disqualification**\n---------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nI propose to consider first the case for disqualification advanced by De Jes\u00fas against all three members of the Committee, namely deficiencies in the Order on Representation, before turning to the individual matters relied upon in relation to Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo.\n\n102.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' primary complaint is that the Committee has not reached its decision on representation as a matter of law, but has reached a decision based on 'political' or pragmatic considerations. This\n\n\"*transformed its decision into an instance of recognition and legitimacy for Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez and his pretended capacity to act in representation of the Republic.*87\"\n\nI do not consider that this assertion is correct. Just as in the case of the other Tribunals and Committees, the Committee has not purported to recognize the legitimacy of Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez claim to represent Venezuela. Had it reached its decision as a matter of law it might have done so, but as De Jes\u00fas complain, the Committee's decision is not advanced as representing a legal decision.\n\nProposal for disqualification, para. 32.\n\n103.\n\nIt is manifest that Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza and Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez cannot both have authority to appoint lawyers to appear on behalf of Venezuela in these proceedings. Which of them has that right depends, or at least may depend, on whether Mr. Maduro or Mr. Guaid\u00f3 presides over the legitimate government of Venezuela. The Committee's decision leaves this political issue wholly at large. The basic issue is whether this was a proper course for the Committee to take.\n\n104.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas submit that the Committee should have founded its decision on the domestic law of Venezuela alone, as the only applicable law. No Tribunal or Committee has done this. It is not axiomatic that, if the Committee's approach had been to base its decision on law, it should have confined its consideration to Venezuelan domestic law. The *Valores Mundiales* Committee based its decision on its view of the law, but the law to which it had regard was not merely Venezuelan domestic law but international law.\n\n105.\n\nThe nature of the legal analysis that might have been appropriate is not, however, the critical question. The critical question is whether the Committee's decision, as a matter of procedure, to permit, *\"at this stage of the proceedings\",* both Curtis and De Jes\u00fas to remain as counsel of record for Venezuela was so egregiously improper as to raise a presumption of manifest lack of independence or impartiality on the part of the three members of the Committee.\n\n**My conclusions**\n------------------\n\n106.\n\nThree questions fall for consideration:\n\n(i) Was the decision reached by the Committee practicable without injustice to either party?\n\n(ii) Was the decision reached by the Committee one that it was proper to make?\n\n(iii) If not, does the decision demonstrate that the members of the Committee have, or appear to have, a manifest lack of independence or impartiality?\n\nThe three questions are interrelated and it is logical to take them in the order set out.\n\n**Was the decision practicable without injustice?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe approach to procedure taken by the Committee mirrors that taken by the Tribunal in the Rectification Proceedings. The Tribunal found that there was no conflict about the substance of the issues on rectification. In those circumstances it was practicable for the Tribunal to treat both representatives as acting for Venezuela without any risk of injustice. No objection was taken to this course.\n\n108.\n\nIn the *Air Canada* case the Tribunal observed in respect of the suggestion that the proceedings should continue with two different Counsel of Respondent that\n\n\"*this avenue could create practical difficulties, particularly in the event of disagreements between the Counsel*88*.*\"\n\nSee para. 31 above.\n\n109.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas cited this passage in its letter of 31 March 2020 in support of the proposition that in the annulment proceedings dual representation involved\n\n\"*a real risk of contradiction in the arguments and in the manner in which they will be presented*89*.*\"\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' letter of 31 March 2020, para. 15.\n\n110.\n\nIn its Order on Representation the Committee accepted that this was the case, but commented :\n\n\"*The possibility of such divergences between Curtis and De Jes\u00fas does not mean that their arguments and theses would not be heard and answered, separately as may be, by the Committee*90*.*\"\n\nOrder on Representation, para. 36.\n\n111.\n\nIt was possible that the submissions of De Jes\u00fas and Curtis in the annulment proceedings would complement each other, rather than conflict with each other, to the benefit of Venezuela. Each would be striving towards the same end. Curtis had been on the record and, presumably, closely involved in the conduct of Venezuela's case from the outset of the Arbitration. It was at least possible that the arguments that it advanced in favour of nullification of the award would commend themselves to De Jes\u00fas. If the two law firms put aside their differences as to which represented the lawful government of Venezuela and cooperated in their efforts to procure the annulment of the Award, it was possible that no conflict would result. But it was also possible that there might be conflict between the cases that the two sought to advance, so that it would cease to be procedurally viable for them both to represent Venezuela. More generally a refusal on the part of the two to cooperate generally might lead to a procedural impasse. As the Tribunal remarked in the *Kimberly-Clark* case91\n\n\"*\u2026the arbitration cannot proceed with two representatives of one and the same party who are in conflict with each other.*\"\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/18/3, Order on Venezuela's Representation, para. 41.\n\n112.\n\nI read the Committee's reference to *\"at this stage of the proceedings\"* in its Order on Representation92 and its comment when confirming that Order that it was *\"subject to review in light of future developments\"* as indicating that the Committee had in mind the possibility that its procedural order would cease to be viable for such reasons.\n\nOrder on Representation, para. 37.\n\n113.\n\nMy conclusion is that, at the time that the Order on Representation was made, there was a possibility that compliance with it would prove practicable without injustice, but that this was by no means certain.\n\n**Was the decision reached by the Committee one that it was proper to make?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas submit that the Committee's decision was reached by\n\n\"*deciding on the most practical, convenient and political solution by simply allowing everyone's continued participation in the proceedings\u2026and only then scrambling to line up some considerations, of fact and not of law to justify its choice*93*.*\"\n\nProposal for Disqualification, para. 20.\n\n115.\n\nI consider that an objective onlooker might well conclude that the Committee was influenced in its approach by consideration of what would be practical, convenient and politic (rather than 'political'). The Committee accepted the submission of Curtis and Conoco as to how to proceed94. Curtis had warned that United States Courts would not recognize an award in proceedings where Venezuela was not represented by a representative of the Guaid\u00f3 government. Conoco had requested that representatives of both Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez and Dr. Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza should remain on the record to obviate the risk that the proceedings would not be recognized by the courts of some countries. It would not have been unreasonable for the members of Committee to consider this a desirable aim.\n\nOrder on Representation, para. 32.\n\n116.\n\nI consider that an objective onlooker might also conclude that the Committee had been attracted by what appeared to be a conveniently simple solution to a problem that other Tribunals and Committees had found thorny.\n\n117.\n\nAs to the basis upon which the Committee founded its decision, it held95\n\n\"*The Committee accepts that the 'status quo' approach adopted in other ICSID proceedings should also apply in the present annulment proceedings.*\"\n\nOrder on Representation, para. 31.\n\n118.\n\nThe Committee did not, however, adopt that approach. The approach adopted in those other proceedings was to proceed on the basis of a presumption that the single representative on the record was the proper representative unless the challenger proved to the contrary. The Tribunals and Committees did not proceed on the simple basis that the *status quo* should be preserved. They considered whether a case had been made out for departing from the *status quo,* and decided that it had not.\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal in the Rectification Proceedings in this Arbitration took a different approach. It permitted the two rival contenders to the representation of Venezuela to take part in the process and to be placed on the record, while making plain that it did so without making any decision as to the entitlement of either to represent the Republic.\n\n120.\n\nThe Committee took the latter approach, continuing that *status quo.* Applications for the Annulment of the Award had been made by both Curtis and De Jes\u00fas. The Centre had registered an Application for the Annulment of the Award. After the Committee was appointed on 3 February 2020, it treated both Curtis and De Jes\u00fas as representing Venezuela in the steps that were taken towards agreeing a procedural order96. When De Jes\u00fas challenged Curtis' continued participation in the proceedings, the Committee rejected the challenge and ruled that both should remain on the record, thus affirming the approach that it, and before it the Tribunal, had adopted.\n\nOrder on Representation, paras. 1 to 16.\n\n121.\n\nNo challenge has been made of the propriety of the conduct of the Tribunal in proceeding as it did, but at that stage of the proceedings neither of the rivals challenged the participation of the other. Was it procedurally proper for the Committee to take the same course, notwithstanding that De Jes\u00fas was challenging the continued participation of Curtis?\n\n122.\n\nI am not aware of any precedent that provides guidance on this question, indeed it is possible that the conflict that has arisen in this case is without precedent.\n\n123.\n\nIn the *Air Canada* case, the *Valores Mundiales* case and the *Kimberly-Clark* case the Tribunal or Committee held, in the circumstances prevailing in those cases, that the proceedings could not continue with rival representation of Venezuela. It is at least possible in the present case that the appropriate course that the Committee should have taken was to resolve, as best it could, the question of which of the two rival contenders had the better case to represent Venezuela.\n\n124.\n\nI do not need to express an opinion on that issue. I propose to proceed on the premise, without deciding the point, that the appropriate course that the Tribunal should have taken, when faced with the De Jes\u00fas' challenge to Curtis' participation in the proceedings, was to resolve which of the two should be permitted to represent Venezuela.\n\n**Does the decision on representation taken by the Committee demonstrate that its members have, or appear to have, a manifest lack of independence or impartiality?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The Committee as a whole.**\n-----------------------------\n\n125.\n\nI shall first address this question having regard to the position of all three members of the Committee, before turning to the particular matters raised in relation to Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo.\n\n126.\n\nI have reached a firm conclusion on this critical issue. I do not consider that the objective bystander would conclude, from the fact of the decision reached by the Committee, that its members had demonstrated a manifest lack of independence or impartiality. Indeed I do not consider that the objective bystander would conclude that the decision reached by the Committee raised even a suspicion of lack of independence or impartiality on their part. I find that the fact that the Committee appears to have been motivated by considerations of what was practical, convenient and politic raises no inference that its members were not independent or impartial.\n\n127.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas have referred to the dual representation of Venezuela as a \"Solomonic solution97\". That is a fair description, referring to a famous decision that was based on pragmatism rather than the law. That decision did not, however, raise any inference that King Solomon lacked independence or impartiality. The Committee may have erred in concluding that it was proper, as a matter of procedure, to have regard to the practical consequences of its decision and to convenience, rather than resolve the issue of which of the two contenders should represent Venezuela. If that was the position, it did not suggest a lack of independence or impartiality.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' letter of 31 March 2020, para. 12.\n\n128.\n\nI should add that I do not consider that any adverse inference falls to be drawn from the fact that, in response to the Disqualification Proposal, the members of the Committee merely re-submitted their declarations of independence and impartiality. This was an appropriate response in the circumstances.\n\n**Judge Hascher**\n-----------------\n\n129.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas submit that the Committee's conduct in issuing the Order on Rectification should be placed in the wider context of Judge Hascher's role as a member of the French *Cour de Cassation98.* The alleged effect of this is summarised above99. I am not able to accept this part of De Jes\u00fas' case for a number of reasons. So far as the *Democratic Transition Framework* is concerned, this was published by the U.S. Government on 31 March 2020 and the press release indicating the support of the French Government for this in relation took place on 3 April 2020, the day of the publication of the Committee's Decision on Representation. It seems manifest that the latter cannot have been influenced by the former.\n\nProposal for Disqualification, para. 36.\n\nAt paragraphs 79, 80.\n\n130.\n\nSupport for the *Democratic Transition Framework* is said to be indicative of the French Government's *\"attempting to interfere with the domestic affairs of the Venezuelan Government\".* The De Jes\u00fas' submission is that the Committee's decision was compatible with this political position because it avoided applying Venezuelan domestic law under which the Statute purporting to give Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez authority to represent the Republic had been declared null and void100. Thus, it is submitted, the Committee's decision would appear to have been motivated, so far as Judge Hascher was concerned, by his duty as a French Judge to show deference to the political position of the French Government.\n\nProposal for Disqualification, para. 40.\n\n131.\n\nI find this submission unrealistic. Judge Hascher's prohibition as a French judge *\"from showing any hostility towards the principle and form of the Government of the Republic, as well as any political demonstration that is incompatible with the restraint that their role requires\"* did not require Judge Hascher, when sitting as an arbitrator, or member of an arbitral committee, to tailor his decisions to accord with the political position of the French Government. To do so would be manifestly improper and I do not consider that a reasonable onlooker would conclude that Judge Hascher might have acted in this way, let alone that he had manifestly done so.\n\n132.\n\nFor this reason I do not accept the specific challenge made to Judge Hascher's appearance of independence and impartiality. I accept that the challenge was timely.\n\n**Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo**\n------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas submit that the decision of the Committee was \"*a diametrically different solution\"* to the representation issue from that reached by the Committee in the *F\u00e1bricade Vidrios* case, of which Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo was a member. An objective observer would conclude that the only reasonable explanation for this was that he had \"*allowed himself to be influenced by factors external to the case of a political nature, thus compromising his ability to exercise independent judgment*101*.*\"\n\nProposal for Disqualification, para. 55.\n\n134.\n\nAs I have observed above102 the approach of the Committee differed from that of previous Tribunals or Committees, including that in the *F\u00e1brica de Vidrios* case. This reflects the fact that the Committee was faced with a different procedural situation, where there had been two rival representatives of Venezuela acting, and on the record for nearly a year. I have questioned whether the approach of the Committee was, in all the circumstances, appropriate, and proceeded on the premise that it was not. But I have concluded that this does not lead to any inference of lack of independence or impartiality on the part of the Tribunal as a whole. This applies equally to Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, considered individually. The fact that he agreed with his colleagues that, in the procedural position prevailing, it was appropriate to reach a different procedural result from that to which he had been party as a member of the Committee in the *F\u00e1brica de Vidrios* case would not lead an objective onlooker to infer that he had lost his independence or impartiality.\n\nParas.114-124.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION**\n------------------\n\n135.\n\nFor these reasons, my Recommendation to the Chair of the Administrative Council of ICSID is that the Disqualification Proposal should be dismissed."}, {"Title": "Chair's Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2020-07-23T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Chair's Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n[1].\n\nI refer to the Proposal for the Disqualification of the Members of the Annulment Committee submitted on April 16, 2020 by Dr. Alfredo De Jes\u00fas O. on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the \"Proposal\").\n\n[2].\n\nThe Proposal was submitted pursuant to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9.

Along with the Application, the Centre received the lodging fee.\n\n2.\n\nUpon delivery of the corresponding hard copies, supporting documentation and USB drives, the Centre transmitted the Application \"to counsel of record in the arbitration proceedings\" (i.e. Freshfields and Three Crowns on behalf of the Conoco Parties and Curtis, De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas and Dentons on the side of Venezuela).\n\n3.\n\nOn 5 December 2019, the Centre received an electronic copy (without exhibits) of an \"Application for Annulment\" submitted by Dr. Alfredo De Jes\u00fas O. from the law firm De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas (\"De Jes\u00fas\"). The Application was signed by Mr. Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, *Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela* (E) (Acting Attorney General) \"in representation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela by the *Procurador\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica de Venezuela*\" and was substantively identical to the one filed by Curtis on 27 November 2019. The Centre also received the corresponding lodging fee. On 16 December 2019, electronic copies of this Application were transmitted \"to counsel of record in the arbitration proceedings\".\n\n4.\n\nOn 16 December 2019, the Centre wrote to the Parties in reference to \"the Application for Annulment submitted by Mr. George Kahale on November 27, 2019, and by Dr. Alfredo De Jes\u00fas O. on 5 December 5, 2019, on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\" The Parties were informed that the Secretary-General \"registered an Application for Annulment of the Award rendered on March 8, 2019\".\n\n5.\n\nOn 3 February 2020, the Committee was constituted, and the Parties were informed that the annulment proceedings were deemed to have begun.\n\n6.\n\nFollowing several communications from the parties, on 15 March 2020, De Jes\u00fas sent a letter asking the Committee to \"exclude the participation\" of Curtis from this proceeding on the basis that it was acting on a power of attorney issued by \"a person who does not exercise any authority or power within the Venezuelan legal system.\"\n\n7.\n\nOn 19 March 2020, the Committee invited Curtis and the Claimants to comment on De Jes\u00fas' 15 March letter regarding Venezuela's representation in this proceeding. Curtis and the Claimants submitted their respective comments on 30 March 2020. De Jes\u00fas replied on 31 March 2020.\n\n8.\n\nOn 3 April 2020, the Committee issued an \"Order on the Applicant's Representation\". The Committee decided not to exclude Curtis from these proceedings and to reject De Jes\u00fas' application of 15 March 2020.\n\n9.\n\nOn 9 April 2020, De Jes\u00fas requested that the Committee revisited its 3 April Order. De Jes\u00fas contended that the Committee ought to amend the Order on the Applicant's Representation \"because it lacks a legal basis as it disregards Venezuelan law, the only applicable law to resolve the issue of representation of the Republic\" and \"ignores the relevant facts in its assessment for the resolution of the issue of representation of the Republic.\"\n\n10.\n\nOn 13 April 2020, the Conoco Parties and Curtis submitted their respective comments on De Jes\u00fas's request for the Committee to revisit its Order on the Applicant's Representation, and on 14 April 2020, De Jes\u00fas replied.\n\n11.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, the Committee ruled on De Jes\u00fas' 9 April application. The Committee observed that the application was based on arguments which were already made by Dr. De Jes\u00fas in his previous letters and had been considered by the Committee when it decided to reject De Jes\u00fas's first application. The Committee therefore denied De Jes\u00fas' 9 April application, although it reminded the parties that its Order was \"limited to the present stage of the proceedings and is subject to review in light of future developments.\"\n\n12.\n\nThe next day, 16 April 2020, De Jes\u00fas filed a proposal to disqualify the three Members of the Committee on behalf of Venezuela. The Disqualification Proposal stated *inter alia* that the terms of the Order on the Applicant's Representation demonstrated that each of the three members of the Committee can no longer be relied upon to exercise independent judgment, as required by Article 14(1) of the Convention.\n\n13.\n\nOn 10 August 2020, the Chairman of the Administrative Council dismissed the disqualification proposal, following a recommendation to that effect made by The Rt. Hon. Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, K.G. The proceedings resumed that day.\n\n14.\n\nOn 3 August 2020, De Jes\u00fas requested that the Committee reconsider its Order on Representation of 3 April 2020. On 12 August 2020, Curtis and the Conoco Parties commented on this request.\n\n15.\n\nOn 28 August 2020, the Committee communicated that it would hear the Parties on this matter and the stay of enforcement of the Award during the hearing that was then reconvened.\n\n16.\n\nOn 30 September 2020, the Committee held a hearing by videoconference. The Parties were given the opportunity to address De Jes\u00fas 3 August application and to expand upon it if they wished (which De Jes\u00fas did).\n\n**II. The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\nA. *De Jes\u00fas*\n-------------\n\n17.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas states that the Committee should reconsider its Order of 3 April 2020 on the Applicant's Representation \"in light of the new and decisive elements that have become available since\". The new element consists of a judgment rendered on 22 April 2020, by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Venezuela in which the Court ruled \"that the Acting Attorney General of the Republic, Mr. Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, has the sole and exclusive authority to appoint representatives in international legal proceedings where the Republic is a party\".1\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' application of 3 August 2020, p. 1.\n\n18.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas asserts that this judgment \"may not be disregarded by the committee\".2 According to De Jes\u00fas, the Court reached this determination interpreting Articles 247, 248, and 249 of the Venezuelan National Constitution and Article 49 of the Organic Law of the Attorney General's Office, the controlling law that should govern Venezuela's representation. Furthermore, the Court upheld the legality of Mr. Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza's appointment as Acting Attorney General and recalled, by reference to its previous judgments of 8 February 2019 and 11 April 2019, that the actions of any person purporting to hold and exercise the functions currently held by Acting Attorney General are to be considered null and void.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' application of 3 August 2020, p. 2.\n\n19.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas underscores that \"holdings of the constitutional chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court are final\".3 Therefore, if there were ever any doubts about the legal representation of Venezuela, this judgment dissipates them all by clarifying the authority of the Acting Attorney General to act on behalf of Venezuela. It also makes it clear that \"the validity of the Acting Attorney General's actions is governed solely by the nullity regime established by the Venezuelan National Constitution and the laws of the Republic and therefore may not be reviewed by the National Assembly which lacks the power to annul or void administrative acts or actions.\"4 Therefore, the Committee must give no weight to the \"Agreement\" issued by the National Assembly on 28 April 2020, that sought to dismiss the authority of the 22 April 2020 judgment by the Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court and upon which Curtis has relied in submissions on this matter.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' application of 3 August 2020, p. 5.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' application of 3 August 2020, p. 5.\n\n20.\n\nTo conclude, De Jes\u00fas remarks that \"it is a basic principle of international law that a State, as subject international law, is represented by its government, which exerts effective control over the State's territory and apparatus.\" The statements of the US Government are therefore irrelevant for present purposes. No \"*practical*\" analysis, no \"*convenient*\" or \"*political*\" consideration may be used to overshadow this basic principle.5\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' application of 3 August 2020, p. 7.\n\nB. *Curtis*\n-----------\n\n21.\n\nCurtis states that the judgment issued on 22 April 2020 by the Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court \"adds nothing to the analysis\".6 In their views, Dr. De Jes\u00fas is \"simply trying to reargue the same points raised in his letters of March 15, March 31, April 9 and April 14, 2020, in which he cited the same legal provisions and a similar court decision.\"\n\nCurtis' comments of 12 August 2020, p. 1.\n\n22.\n\nMost importantly, Curtis submits that \"De Jes\u00fas' application reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of this Committee's decision on the representation issue.\" Curtis states that the Committee did not base its decision on any uncertainty regarding the position of Dr. De Jes\u00fas. It refers on this point to a passage of the Order on the Applicant's Representation where the Committee stated that it \"is neither a political body nor the deliberative organ of an International Organization, [and] cannot hear -and decide - a political question, such as the legitimate government of Venezuela...\".\n\n23.\n\nFinally, Curtis contends that \"[a]ccepting Mr. De Jes\u00fas' argument would not only be prejudicial to Venezuela, but it would be embroiling this Committee in the political question it properly recognized was beyond its jurisdiction and upsetting the status quo in this annulment proceeding, which began when we filed the application for annulment on November 27, 2019, which application was then retyped word-for-word and resubmitted by Mr. De Jes\u00fas on December 5, 2019.\"7\n\nCurtis' comments of 12 August 2020, p. 2.\n\nC. *Conoco Parties*\n-------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn response to the Committee's invitation to comment on De Jes\u00fas' application, the Conoco Parties refer to their prior submissions regarding Venezuela's representation, and the Committee's rulings on this matter. Accordingly, they \"see no need or reason to comment further on Venezuela's latest request\",8 although they express their concerns about what they see as \"the continuation of Venezuela's delay tactics, imported over from the underlying arbitration, which serve Venezuela's purposes as long as a stay of enforcement remains in effect.\"9\n\nThe Conoco Parties' comments of 12 August 2020, p. 2\n\nThe Conoco Parties' comments of 12 August 2020, p. 2\n\n**III. The Committee's Analysis**\n---------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nAs noted above, the present annulment proceedings against the Award of 8 March 2019 have been launched on 27 November 2019 with an Application submitted by Mr. George Kahale from the law firm of Curtis on behalf of Venezuela and with an Application submitted by Dr. Alfredo De Jes\u00fas O. from the law firm De Jes\u00fas, on 5 December 2019, also on behalf of Venezuela. This latter Application was signed by Mr. Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, *Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela* (E) (Acting Attorney General) \"in representation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela by the *Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica de Venezuela*\" and was substantively identical to the one filed by Curtis on 27 November 2019.\n\n26.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Venezuela was thus represented by Curtis and De Jes\u00fas when the Committee became constituted on 3 February 2020. We also recall that Curtis represented Venezuela in the underlying arbitration which started on 2 November 2007 until 6 March 2019, when its power of attorney was revoked by Venezuela's Acting Attorney General, Mr. Reinaldo Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza. Since 5 April 2019, Curtis is instructed by Venezuela's Special Attorney General, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez. De Jes\u00fas is instructed by the Acting Attorney General under a power of attorney of 6 March 2019 notified to the Arbitral Tribunal on 7 March 2019, one day before the Award was rendered. Venezuela was represented by Curtis and De Jes\u00fas in the rectification proceedings which began on 16 April 2019 with an Application submitted by Curtis and a letter of 19 April 2019 of De Jes\u00fas making reference to Curtis' Application for Rectification.\n\n27.\n\nIn rejecting, on 15 April 2020, De Jes\u00fas' request to revisit the Order on the Applicant's Representation of 3 April 2020, the Committee indicated that the Order is \"limited to the present stage of the proceedings and is subject to review in light of future developments. Should this be the case in the future, there would be further opportunity to renew the contents of the April 9 letter with other arguments as they may be\".10\n\nDe Jesus' request of 9 April 2020 to revisit the Order on the Applicant's Representation of 3 April 2020.\n\n28.\n\nOn this basis, De Jes\u00fas submits in its request of 3 August 2020 that the Order on the Applicant's Representation of 3 April 2020 cannot be maintained in light of the Judgment made on 22 April 2020 by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Venezuela, which ruled that the Acting Attorney General of the Republic, Mr. Reinaldo Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, has the sole and exclusive authority to appoint representatives in international legal proceedings where the Republic is a party.\n\n29.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas explains that the holdings of the Constitutional Chamber clarify in the 22 April 2020 Judgment \"the legal uncertainty regarding the international legal representation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\" which have led the Committee to erroneously allow Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez to act on behalf of the Republic in the annulment proceedings. The same Judgment states besides that the validity of the Acting Attorney General's actions are solely governed by the nullity regime of the Constitution and the laws of Venezuela and cannot be reviewed by the National Assembly. According to the said Judgment, four elements must be taken into consideration for reconsideration of the issue of representation: (i) the National Assembly is not the body in charge of the appointment of the Attorney General (ii) the office of *Procurador Especial* does not exist according to the Constitution and laws of Venezuela (iii) no valid act or judgment has been issued in the national legal order that revokes, annul or calls into question the appointment or authority of Mr. Reinaldo Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza (iv) there is no valid act in the national legal order that appointed another person to the position.11\n\nJudgment of 22 April 2020, Annex 14.\n\n30.\n\nThe decisions taken by the legislative and judicial branches of Venezuela on the appointment of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez which have been discussed by the Parties include in chronological order:\n\n- Decision of 5 February 2019 of the Interim President of Venezuela, Mr. Guaid\u00f3, to appoint Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez;\n\n- Judgment of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of 8 February 2019 annulling the Statute Governing the Transition to Democracy to Restore the Full Force and effect of the Constitution of Venezuela enacted on 5 February 2019;12\n\n- Approval by the National Assembly on 27 February 2019 of the appointment by Mr. Guaid\u00f3 of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez to the office of Special Attorney General provided by Article 15 of the Statute Governing the Transition to Democracy to Restore the Full Force and Effect of the Constitution of Venezuela;\n\n- Resolution of the National Assembly of 19 March 2019 reaffirming that Mr. Reinaldo Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza cannot represent Venezuela;\n\n- Judgment of the Supreme Court of 11 April 2019 annulling the appointment of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez as a consequence of the nullity of the Statute Governing the Transition to Democracy to Restore the Full Force and Effect of the Constitution of Venezuela;\n\n- Judgment of the Supreme Court of 22 April 2020; and\n\n- Resolution of the National Assembly of 28 April 2020 on the Refusal of the Judgment of the Illegitimate Constitutional Chamber of 22 April 2020.13\n\nAnnex 4 to De Jesus letter of 15 Mars 2020\n\nAnnex 15.\n\n31.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas avers that little weight should be given to the National Assembly Resolution of 28 April 2020 because, according to Article 335 of the Constitution of Venezuela, the finality of the judgments of the Constitutional Chamber are binding precedents which must be followed by all Venezuelan courts. De Jes\u00fas explains in this regard that the constitutional interpretations of the Supreme Court participate of a mixed system between civil law and common law.14 De Jes\u00fas likewise encourages the Committee to disregard the National Assembly Resolution of 19 March 2019 since the decisions of the Constitutional Chamber cannot be overturned by the National Assembly. De Jes\u00fas further reminds that there has been no governmental change or any change in the exercise of effective control over the Venezuelan State's territory and apparatus.15\n\nEnglish Transcripts, pp. 8: 16-25, 9: 1-24.\n\nLetter of 3 August 2020, pp. 6-7.\n\n32.\n\nOn the one hand, it is a fact that the Judgment of 18 February 2019 of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court declared that the Statute Governing the Transition to Democracy to Restore the Full Force and Effect of the Constitution of Venezuela is an act of force. The same Judgment clarifies that any citizen who intends to usurp the powers held by Mr. Reinaldo Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza commits a criminal offense.\n\n33.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also a fact that the Interim President of Venezuela relied on the above mentioned Statute to appoint Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez to the office of Special Attorney General on 5 February 2019 and that such appointment was approved by the National Assembly on 27 February 2019 and that on 28 April 2020 the National Assembly decided that, because of the illegitimate composition of the Supreme Court, none of the judgments of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court since 23 December 2015 may be considered as valid and much less binding within the terms of Article 335 of the Constitution.16\n\nAnnex 15, p. 2.\n\n34.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas proposes to resolve this conflict of authorities by disregarding the acts of the legislative branch on the assumption that there is no doubt that, from the perspective of international law, President Maduro exerts effective control over the territory of Venezuela and over the State apparatus. The arguments of De Jes\u00fas calling the Committee to end the double representation of Venezuela as contrary to Venezuelan and international law suppose that the Committee applies the criterion of effective control, which implies that the Committee recognizes President Maduro as head of State and head of Government in Venezuela.17 This could not be done without contradicting the Parties' admission that the Committee cannot engage with deciding the legitimacy of powers in Venezuela.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, pp. 13: 20-25, 14: 1-9.\n\n35.\n\nWhen the matter of Venezuela's representation by Curtis in these proceedings was decided on 3 April 2020, the Committee assumed in light of the Parties' submissions that \"there is no question that Venezuela is the proper identity of the State applying for annulment in these proceedings. The Parties do not seriously dispute that the Committee, which is neither a political body nor the deliberative organ of an International Organization, cannot hear - and decide - a political question, such as the legitimate government of Venezuela\".18 The Committee relies on this position as still valid for deciding De Jes\u00fas' Request for Reconsideration of 3 August 2020.\n\nOrder on the Applicant's Representation of 3 April 2020, \u00b6 29.\n\n36.\n\nThe Committee has been constituted to decide the validity of the Award of 8 March 2019 between the Conoco Parties and Venezuela under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and not to rule on where and with whom lies the legitimate government of Venezuela. It is worth reminding that the only basis for the Committee to decide Venezuela's representation in these annulment proceedings by Curtis lies in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention which provides, in relevant part:\n\n\"If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\"\n\n37.\n\nUnder this humble remit, the Committee cannot vindicate the actions of one branch of the Constitutional powers over the actions of another branch without engaging with the prevailing legality in the country and turning itself into a final arbiter of the Constitutional powers of Venezuela. Under article 44 of the ICSID Convention, the Committee's more modest concern is to ensure that Venezuela enjoys its rights of defense in the annulment proceedings in being also represented by Curtis.\n\n38.\n\nThe chronology of actions taken by the judicial and legislative branches of Venezuela indicates that each of these Constitutional powers has systematically thwarted the other's decision regarding the office of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez. If the Committee were to exclude Curtis each time the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court makes an adverse pronouncement to Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez, there would be some logic in readmitting Curtis each time the National Assembly passes a resolution affirming Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez's powers. As of today, the Committee notes that the National Assembly has had the last word by declaring on 28 April 2020 the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court an illegitimate body whose judgments since 23 December 2015 are without effect or force, including the Judgment of 22 April 2020. The Committee cannot see how the procedural interests of Venezuela would be served by having a swing-wing representation dependent upon the vagaries of the quest of power in Venezuela.\n\n39.\n\nThe Committee therefore cannot exclude on the basis of the Judgment of 22 April 2020 the representation of Venezuela by Curtis. Failing any demonstration that Venezuela's representation should be in the hands of De Jes\u00fas, to the exclusion of Curtis, for the preservation of Venezuela's rights to accede to justice, the Request for reconsideration of 3 August 2020 is rejected.\n\n40.\n\nIn reaching this decision, the Committee is mindful of Mr. Reinaldo Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza's admonition at the hearing of 30 September 2020 that the participation of people who do not have the competence of representing Venezuela violates its sovereignty.19 In rejecting the request for reconsideration for other purposes than resolving whether Curtis is acting on a power of attorney issued by Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez who does not exercise any authority or power within the Venezuelan legal system, the Committee has not identified the legitimate government of Venezuela at the detriment of Mr. Maduro. By refusing to engage in the rivalry between the two contenders for power in Venezuela, the Committee cannot have negated in any manner the sovereignty of Venezuela.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, p. 2: 17-24.\n\n**IV. Decision**\n----------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Committee decides:\n\n- to reject the request for reconsideration of the Order on Representation of 3 April 2020; and that\n\n- all questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Committee and of the Parties in connection with this request are reserved for subsequent determination, together with the Application for Annulment."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Applicant's Request to Continue the Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2020-11-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Applicant's Request to Continue the Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 16 December 2019, the Centre wrote to the Parties in reference to \"the Application for Annulment submitted by Mr. George Kahale on November 27, 2019, and by Dr. Alfredo De Jes\u00fas O. on December 5, 2019, on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\" The Parties were informed that the Secretary-General \"registered an Application for Annulment of the Award rendered on March 8, 2019\" and that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), \"the enforcement of the Award [was] provisionally stayed\" as requested by Venezuela.1\n\nApplication for Annulment of 27 November 2019, \u00b6 84; Application for Annulment of 5 December 2019, \u00b6 84.\n\n2.\n\nOn 3 February 2020, the Committee was constituted, and the Parties were informed that the annulment proceedings were deemed to have begun.\n\n3.\n\nOn 4 February 2020, the Respondents on Annulment (hereinafter the \"Conoco Parties\" or the \"Claimants\") opposed to Venezuela's request to continue the stay of enforcement.\n\n4.\n\nOn 18 February 2020, the Committee fixed 16 March 2020 for Venezuela's response on the stay of enforcement of the Award. The Parties were also informed that pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Committee extended the stay of enforcement until the Committee had heard the Parties and it is in a position to reach a final determination on this matter.\n\n5.\n\nOn 16 March 2020, De Jes\u00fas and Curtis submitted each a response on Claimants' Opposition to Venezuela's request to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n6.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' positions, the Committee invited the Parties on 3 April 2020 to elaborate upon the following six matters by 14 April 2020:\n\n1) Have the Conoco Parties and Venezuela had any contact regarding the enforcement of the Award? What enforcement actions (if any) did the Conoco Parties take after the Award was rendered until enforcement was stayed by the Secretary-General of ICSID upon registration of the Application for Annulment? What are the prospects of enforcing the Award outside the United States?\n\n2) Can any non-compliance be directly linked to economic difficulties and/or the US sanctions? Is this relevant for purposes of the Committee's decision on whether to maintain or lift the stay of enforcement of the Award?\n\n3) What would be the specific prejudice of deferring enforcement of the Award to a later date having regard to Venezuela's alleged refusal or inability to honour any award presently and to the freezing of its assets in the US? Are there other creditors that enjoy priority of payment over the Conoco Parties?\n\n4) What steps have the Conoco Parties taken to obtain such license and what is the likelihood that they may be granted one soon? What effect, if any, can have such sanctions on the Conoco Parties' ability to return any funds paid on the Award if annulled? Would the Conoco Parties be willing to give an undertaking that all amounts recovered as a result of enforcement actions will be placed in escrow or with a trustee that is not subject to the sanctions for the duration of the annulment proceedings?\n\n5) What would be the precise impact of the Award's enforcement on Venezuela's State budget? What efforts, if any, has Venezuela taken to restructure its debt and how can this have an effect on Venezuela's ability to pay awards rendered against it?\n\n6) What is the financial situation of the Conoco Parties at present? How does the outcome of this proceeding affect the Conoco Parties' accounts?\n\n7.\n\nThe Parties' responses were received on 14 April (the Conoco Parties and Curtis) and on 15 April (De Jes\u00fas) 2020.\n\n8.\n\nOn 16 April 2020, the proceedings were suspended as a result of a proposal to disqualify the three Members of the Committee submitted by Dr. Alfredo De Jes\u00fas O. on behalf of Venezuela. On 10 August 2020, the disqualification proposal was dismissed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council, and the proceedings resumed.\n\n9.\n\nOn 23 July 2020, the Conoco Parties wrote to update the Committee on questions 3 and 4 above.\n\n10.\n\nPursuant to the Committee's invitation on 24 July 2020, Venezuela (Curtis and De Jes\u00fas) replied on 3 August 2020.\n\n11.\n\nPursuant to a request on 4 August 2020, the Committee allowed the Conoco Parties to answer by 12 August 2020, which they did.\n\n12.\n\nOn 13 August 2020, Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) sought leave to reply to the Conoco Parties' August 12 submission.\n\n13.\n\nVenezuela (De Jes\u00fas) filed its reply on 20 August 2020 requesting production of OFAC authorizations.\n\n14.\n\nOn 18 September 2020, Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) reiterated its document production request.\n\n15.\n\nOn 21 September 2020, the Committee replied that unless the Conoco Parties would like to add anything to their letter of 12 August 2020 regarding the OFAC authorizations, De Jes\u00fas' request for an order to produce such authorizations would be one of the issues at the hearing on 30 September which the Parties may address.\n\n16.\n\nThe Conoco Parties answered on 23 September 2020 that they did not intend to supplement their letter of 12 August 2020 regarding OFAC authorizations.\n\n17.\n\nOn 30 September 2020, the Committee held a hearing by videoconference with the Parties. The Parties discussed whether the stay of enforcement of the Award should be maintained or not.\n\n**II. Parties' Submissions**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. The Applicant2**\n---------------------\n\nIn summarizing the Applicant's position, the Committee follows the chronological order in which the Applications for Annulment were received. No preference should be inferred therefrom.\n\n**1) Curtis:**\n--------------\n\n18.\n\nVenezuela declares in its Response to Claimants' Opposition to Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award of 16 March 2020 that the exceptional circumstances of the case warrant maintenance of the stay, irrespective of the standards to be applied.3 Venezuela also rejects the Conoco Parties' allegations concerning Venezuela's alleged misconduct during the arbitration proceedings as well as the Conoco Parties' statements in respect of Venezuela's compliance with other awards.4\n\nCurtis' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6 18.\n\nCurtis' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 5-16.\n\n19.\n\nVenezuela argues that the irreparable harm to Venezuela should the Award be enforced vastly outweighs Conoco's interest in lifting the stay.5 Several Decisions of *ad* hoc committees have taken into account the burden that would be imposed on States in light of their economic situation. Precisely, Venezuela's economy is in the midst of a crisis of historic proportions and the unprecedented amount of the Award, which represents over 13,5% of its estimated GDP in 2020, would risk precipitating a chaotic run on Venezuela's assets and undermine any attempt to persuade creditors to participate in a voluntary, orderly and comprehensive restructuring of Venezuela's debt.6\n\nCurtis' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 23-27.\n\nCurtis' Letter of 14 April 2020, p. 4.\n\n20.\n\nThe Applicant avers that the Conoco Parties identify no prejudice if the stay is maintained in a case which has been pending for almost thirteen years, essentially due to Conoco's actions in the arbitration.7 The Conoco Parties' prejudice for waiting another year after 13 years since the nationalization of their assets would not be enormous because their wait will become permanent after annulment as Curtis places emphasis on the seriousness of the issues raised in the Application.8\n\nCurtis' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, pp. 31: 14-25, 32, 34: 11-17, 35: 4-18.\n\n21.\n\nVenezuela clarifies that Conoco commenced two actions in Delaware against PDVSA, Venezuela's national oil company, and its US subsidiaries which have been dismissed.9 The Conoco Parties will not be able to take the Award and proceed against PDVSA without proof it is the alter ego of the Republic.10 The Applicant explains that enforcement of the Award in the United States is prohibited in light of the sanctions issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"). All of Venezuela's assets in the United States have been frozen and cannot be attached absent a specific license from OFAC which Conoco has not obtained. Conoco would also not be able to hold the funds in escrow and return them to Venezuela without a specific license.11 Venezuela notes that the Conoco Parties are Dutch shell subsidiaries of a major US oil company which have been formed only to take advantage of the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT.12\n\nCurtis' Letter of 14 April 2020, p. 2.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, pp. 37: 4-25, 38: 1-23.\n\nCurtis' Letter of 14 April 2020, p. 4.\n\nCurtis' Letter of 14 April 2020, p. 5.\n\n**2) De Jes\u00fas:**\n----------------\n\n22.\n\nVenezuela declares in the Response to the Opposition to Continue the Stay of Enforcement of the Award on 16 March 2020 that the Committee is empowered to maintain the stay until the decision on annulment is rendered.13 Notwithstanding the lacuna found in the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules on how a stay of enforcement should be treated, *ad hoc* committees have accepted that they enjoy discretionary powers to decide a stay. Venezuela says it has identified a general practice of *ad hoc* committees of rulings in favor of maintaining the stay.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 13 *et seq.*\n\n23.\n\nVenezuela suggests that the Committee takes into account the following circumstances:\n\na) whether the application for annulment is submitted in good faith;\n\nb) whether there is a risk of non-compliance of the challenged award by the applicant in the event the award is not annulled;\n\nc) whether the balance of harms is in favor of the continuance of enforcement, namely whether termination of the stay would cause significant and irreparable injury to the award debtor and the award creditor would be prejudiced if the stay of enforcement continues pending a decision on annulment.14\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6 23.\n\n24.\n\nVenezuela affirms that it has always acted in compliance with its international obligations arising from the ICSID Convention in the arbitration proceedings and in challenging the Award.15 Venezuela describes as the epitome of serious grounds for annulment, arbitral proceedings led by a majority that fails to meet the requirements of independence and impartiality and that is capable to refuse to consent to the resignation for health reasons of Venezuela's appointed arbitrator, and then further decides to obstruct the regular course of the proceedings by denying the Republic's right to appoint its arbitrator. The preceding combined with the Arbitral Tribunal's manifest excess of powers in connection with its findings, its disregards of the taking and evaluation of evidence, its contradictory and inadequate conclusions and its utter disregard of points of law and fact are also serious grounds for annulment.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 25-37*.*\n\n25.\n\nVenezuela further says that neither the denunciation of the ICSID Convention in January 2012, nor political declarations by its former President and Minister of Foreign Affairs made in the context of denouncing abuses of the arbitration system by a foreign investor or decisions of the Venezuelan Supreme Court, are valid reasons to question Venezuela's compliance with its international obligations under ICSID.16 Venezuela contends that it does not have a pattern of non-compliance with ICSID obligations, and that, when it happened, the payment of award creditors was made impossible due to the sanctions imposed by the United States.17 The general rule under international law is that a sovereign State's good faith must always be presumed even if it has committed wrongful acts in the past.18\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 38-53.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 54-62.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, p. 17: 1-17.\n\n26.\n\nVenezuela alleges that it will suffer irreparable harm if the stay is not maintained.19 It points out that the amount of the Award of over USD 8,5 billion is the largest in ICSID history and that an immediate enforcement would require the Republic to allocate considerable sums of its Gross Domestic Product (\"GDP\") to comply with a 985.5% inflation rate. Venezuela also says that the Committee should take into consideration the deliberate aggravation of its economic situation by a framework of illegitimate economic, financial and commercial US sanctions which also frustrate the Republic's efforts to discuss with creditors an organized payment process.20 The COVID-19 crisis is now on top of the profound economic crisis inflicted by the US Government.21\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 63-75.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Letter of 14 April 2020.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, p. 22: 8-19.\n\n27.\n\nVenezuela adds that an immediate payment of the Award, should it be subsequently annulled, would put it at risk of not being able to recover the amount paid. First, the Conoco Parties are shell companies with precarious financial health. Second, the US sanctions program would also make it impossible to recover payment.\n\n28.\n\nAs contrasted, says Venezuela, the Conoco Parties would bear no prejudice from the continuance of the stay.22 In particular, the Conoco Parties are unable to attach Venezuela's assets frozen in the Unites States without a license from OFAC. The Republic finally points out that the Conoco Parties are safeguarded by the accrual of the 5,5% compound interest rate ordered in the Award.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 76-82.\n\n**B. The Respondents on Annulment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Conoco Parties recall in their Opposition to Venezuela's Request to Continue the Stay of Enforcement of the Award on 4 February 2020 (\"the Stay Opposition\") that ICSID awards are immediately enforceable, that only exceptional circumstances may justify a stay, that the party seeking the stay bears the burden of establishing such circumstances and that a stay must be lifted if there is a material risk of an award debtor's non-compliance with an award.23\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Submission of 4 February 2020.\n\n30.\n\nThe Conoco Parties say that they received no response from Venezuela to their demand letter for payment of the Award and they therefore commenced actions in several jurisdictions to enforce the Award.24 However, Venezuela's policy is not to comply with ICSID awards.25 The Conoco Parties refer to declarations of the Venezuelan highest public authorities that the country will not comply with adverse ICSID awards which, the Conoco Parties say, are binding on Venezuela as a matter of international law. In addition, Venezuelan courts have held that ICSID Convention obligations cannot be enforced if inconsistent with Venezuela's Constitution. The Conoco Parties contend that all post-Chavez ICSID awards rendered against Venezuela remain unpaid and that their enforcement has been resisted at every opportunity.26 Because of its economic mismanagement, Venezuela is alone responsible for its situation.27 There exists no requirement that award creditors negotiate settlements for discounted sums paid over long periods in lieu of the full and final payment that the ICSID Convention mandates.28 Any deferral of time significantly reduces the prospect for the Conoco Parties to collect on the Award.29 As a part of its obstructive tactics, Venezuela has taken steps to render itself immune from enforcement actions in the United States in order to frustrate the collection of award monies.30 As a result, the Conoco Parties' prospects for enforcement of the Award diminish with the passing of time.31\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Letter of 14 April 2020, pp. 1-3.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Submission of 4 February 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 21-28.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Submission of 4 February 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 29-32.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Letter of 14 April 2020, pp. 17-19.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, p. 54: 6-14.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Letter of 14 April 2020, pp. 11-14.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Submission of 4 February 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 33-41.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Letter of 14 April 2020, pp. 3-5.\n\n31.\n\nThe Conoco Parties remark that post-award interests merely protect against the passage of time and are not a protection against the refusal of the debtor to honor the award.32 Given the twelve arbitrations pending against Venezuela and the thirteen currently outstanding investment treaty awards to pay, and in the context of the contracting economy of Venezuela which has defaulted on all its sovereign debt, the Respondents on Annulment contend that they will be seriously and irreversibly prejudiced unless immediate enforcement of the Award is allowed. Now that they have authorization from the US Government to execute upon certain assets, any delay is harm.33 Conoco remark that Venezuela is alone responsible for the present economic circumstances which cannot be raised as a justification for the continuation of the stay. Conoco, which underline that there is no material risk that they would not be able to repay sums owing if the Award is annulled, are willing to earmark funds received during the pendency of the annulment proceedings or to consider other similar protective measures.34\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Submission of 4 February 2020, \u00b6 43.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, p. 60: 13-19.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Letter of 14 April 2020, pp. 16, 17, 20, 21.\n\n**III. Committee's Analysis**\n-----------------------------\n\n**A. The ICSID Convention framework on enforcement and stay of awards**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention, the award creditor has a right to enforcement of the award. Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention unambiguously states that awards have *res judicata* effect and are immediately enforceable from the date on which the certified copies are dispatched to the parties.35 The Parties do not dispute that Article 53(1) of the Convention explains that a stay of enforcement is an exception to the obligation of the parties to \"abide by and comply with the terms of the award\".36 Effective recognition and enforcement is emphasized by the requirement that an ICSID award must be complied with, subject to possible interpretation, revision or annulment envisaged at Articles 50, 51 and 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nArticle 53(1) of the Convention provides as follows: \"[t]he award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\"\n\nIn particular, De Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6 20.\n\n33.\n\nThe award creditor needs to take no further step to secure the award's enforceability besides proving its authenticity as stated at Article 54(2) of the ICSID Convention.37 In contrast, the award debtor must apply for a stay and advance the reasons which justify the stay.38 If a stay is granted, the obligation to comply with the award is suspended. The award may no more be subject to the enforcement procedure of Article 54 of the Convention until the *ad hoc* committee decides on the application for annulment. As explained in Article 52(5) of the Convention, a stay of enforcement is never automatic: \"[t]he Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request\". *Ad hoc* committees accept that there is no presumption in favour of maintaining the stay, the circumstances of which must be proven by the requesting party.39\n\nArticle 54(2) requires the award creditor to prove the authenticity of the award by furnishing the competent court or other authority of a Contracting State with a copy of the award certified by the Secretary-General of ICSID.\n\nArbitration Rule 54(1) and (4).\n\n*Churchill Mining Plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Decision on the Request for Continued Stay of Enforcement of Award, 27 June 2017, \u00b6 34; *Tenaris S.A. and Talta -Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/26, Decision on the Request to Maintain the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 24 March 2017, \u00b6 74 [hereinafter Tenaris I].\n\n34.\n\nVenezuela has requested a stay in its Application(s) for Annulment within the above-mentioned context of the ICSID Convention. In accordance with ICSID Rule 54(2), a provisional stay of the Award was ordered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 16 December 2019, and the matter came before the Committee upon opposition of the Conoco Parties on 4 February 2020 to continue the stay.\n\n35.\n\nThe provisional stay accorded by the Secretariat remains effective until the *ad hoc* committee is constituted and rules by priority on the stay in pursuance of ICSID Rule 54(1) and (2). As noted by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Sempra v. Argentina*, there is no presumption in favour of maintaining the initial provisional stay of enforcement which the Secretariat has no discretion to refuse.40\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 5 March 2009, \u00b6 27 (A/CLA-16).\n\n36.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas suggests that the case by case approach followed by committees shows a favor for the continuance of the stay of enforcement.41 The practice of *ad hoc* committees is however more diverse: \"The practice of previous annulment cases has consisted in the granting of the continuance of the stay. This trend has led some ad hoc committees to conclude that there would be a presumption in favor of the continuance of the stay. However, recent decisions tend to confirm that no such presumption exists\".42 At any rate, the alleged fact that *ad hoc* committees may have statistically granted a stay does not allow to conclude about the automatic nature of such stay. The Committee cannot agree more with Curtis that \"the decision whether or not to lift the stay cannot be made in the abstract, nor should it be an automatic knee-jerk reaction based on some made-up rule of general application\".43\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6 18.\n\n*Elsamex, S.A. v. Republic of Honduras*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/4, Decision on Elsamex S.A.'s Preliminary Objections, 7 January 2014 \u00b6 86 (A/RLA-4).\n\nTranscripts, p. 29: 20-23.\n\n37.\n\nThe right to enforce a decision is one aspect of the right of access to justice which is one component of the Rule of Law that the ICSID Convention purports to achieve in the settlement of international investment disputes. Access to justice is, however, not an absolute right and the Convention provides a limitation by allowing the possibility of a stay until the date of the decision on annulment. An *ad hoc* Committee has all latitude to find the proper balance between the interests of the Applicant for a stay and the Respondent's legitimate right to enforce the award.44 It is not possible to give a catalog of all factors to be taken into account in the confrontation of the rival interests involved. The Committee will have to examine the facts to see if the circumstances specified by Venezuela in furtherance of ICSID Rule 54(4) to justify continuation of the stay exist.\n\n*Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v. Georgia*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15, Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 12 November 2010, \u00b6 29 (A/CLA n\u00b0 10) [hereinafter *Kardassopoulos*]. See De Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 21-24.\n\n38.\n\nBefore we delve into any balancing exercise, the Conoco Parties denounce an abuse of the ICSID system by Venezuela which, it says, launches annulment proceedings reflexively in the hope of buying itself a stay and some time as is demonstrated by Venezuela's applications to annul all twelve of ICSID awards rendered against it since 2003. The extraordinary nature of the annulment mechanism of the ICSID Convention would thus have become a routine step in Venezuela's strategy of delay.45\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Submission of 4 February 2020,\u00b6 32. Transcripts, p. 44: 23-25, 45: 1-3.\n\n39.\n\nThe Committee observes that applying for annulment is a right under the ICSID Convention. Pending a decision on annulment, Venezuela can only address the Committee for a stay under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, to the exclusion of the competent court or authority of the Contracting State where enforcement is sought mentioned in Article 54(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n40.\n\nAs advanced by another *ad hoc* Committee in *Flughafen,*46 this Committee cannot speculate on Venezuela's non-compliance with international awards to hold abusive the request to maintain the stay of enforcement until the conclusion of the annulment proceedings. The Committee likely endorses the statement of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Enron v. Argentina* which held that \"the Committee must assume that any application for annulment is made in good faith, and that the application for a stay is a justified exercise of the applicant's procedural rights of defence\".47\n\n*Flughafen Z\u00fcrich A.G. and Gestion e Ingeniera IDC S.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/19, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 11 March 2016, \u00b6 66 (A/CLA-7) [hereinafter *Flughafen*]. See also ICJ: Dispute Regarding Navigational and Related Rights, 2009, \u00b6 150, n\u00b0 A/RLA-23 and Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay, 2010, \u00b6 278, n\u00b0 A/RLA-24.\n\n*Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 7 October 2008, \u00b6 47 (R-805).\n\n41.\n\nHaving thus found the absence of an abuse of process on the part of the Applicant, we now move to review the circumstances identified by Venezuela that would be sufficiently compelling in the present case to require a continuation of the stay.\n\n**B. Venezuela's arguments in support of the Continuation of the Stay (to be discussed)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1) The likelihood of an annulment of the Award\n----------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nCurtis stresses that it is virtually certain that the Award will be annulled.48 If a bald assertion of the likelihood of success were adequate, a stay would be granted in every case. The Committee can only speculate at present about Curtis' remark. The Application for Annulment only identifies among the grounds of annulment listed at Article 52(1) of the Convention those that will serve as a basis for the action to set the Award aside. These are neither developed nor substantiated. As remarked by one *ad hoc* Committee,49 an evaluation of the arguments in support of the application for annulment would throw the committee into an examination of the regularity or the soundness of the reasons of the impugned award, when the Committee's task in the present context is to evaluate the necessity for a measure pending the annulment proceedings. The Committee holds that the likelihood of Venezuela's success does not constitute a circumstance justifying the grant of a stay of execution.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, pp. 31: 20-25, 32: 1-24.\n\n*Kardassopoulos*, \u00b6 26 (A/CLA n\u00b0 10). Other Committees have ruled in a like manner that the strength of the case on annulment is without basis to support the continuation of the stay (see Ch. Schreuer and others, The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed., 2010, p. 1072, n\u00b0 611).\n\n2) The absence of prejudice caused to Conoco by deferring enforcement\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Conoco Parties describe Venezuela's policy, regardless of the US sanctions, as one not to comply with awards.50 They rely on the declarations of the Venezuelan President and Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the country denounced the ICSID Convention on 25 January 2012, which, the Conoco Parties contend, far from being political declarations as insinuated by Venezuela,51 are binding as a matter of international law. The Respondents on annulment also point out to the case law of the Venezuelan Supreme Court following which ICSID Convention provisions inconsistent with the Constitution cannot be enforced.52\n\nEnglish Transcripts, pp. 51:11-25, 52, 53:1-5.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020Jes\u00fas, \u00b6 41.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Submission of 4 February 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26.

De Jes\u00fas however contests the interpretation made by Conoco, De Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6 51.\n\n44.\n\nThe ICSID Convention pro-enforcement scheme depends on the compliance of all Contracting States. The possible contrariety of Venezuela's constitutional system, or possibly, governmental action, with Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention would question the State of Venezuela's compliance with its international obligations under the Convention, notwithstanding its withdrawal from the ICSID system in 2012 which has no retroactive effect pursuant to Article 72 of the Convention.53 The duties of a State arising under Article 54 regarding its enforcement obligations are owed to all Contracting States and whether Venezuela has breached its obligations under the ICSID Convention falls to be decided by the International Court of Justice as provided by Article 64 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, p. 6: 12-21.\n\n45.\n\nIt remains that the Committee recognizes that the attitude of the debtor is one of the reasons that can give rise to legitimate fears of non-compliance that would weigh in favor of lifting the stay.54 There has been a considerable amount of debate between the Parties as to Venezuela's compliance with investment awards rendered against it. The Conoco Parties say they are \"unaware of *any* example of Venezuela voluntarily complying with an award promptly and in full\".55 They declare that Venezuela seeks to leverage the complexity and costs of forced execution to avoid fulfilling its ICSID obligations, so that award creditors are forced to negotiate settlements in lieu of full and final payment as required by the ICSID Convention.56 Venezuela denies any pattern of non-compliance as alleged by the Conoco Parties and cites various examples of cases in which, Venezuela avers, it \"has successfully reached several high stake compensation agreements\".57\n\n*Tenaris S.A. and Talta E Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal LDA v.

English Transcripts, p. 28.\n\n46.\n\nNon-compliance at a general level with regard to other awards is an element of appreciation,58 but as remarked by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Flughafen*, it \"*could not be speculated on Venezuela's incapacity of payment or its non-compliance with its international financial obligations or voluntary compliance with international awards*\".59 Because the Committee does not wish to speculate on the enforcement of the 8 March 2019 Award, it precisely asked the Parties about the steps taken regarding voluntary compliance with the Award.60 The Conoco Parties indicate that they wrote to De Jes\u00fas on 11 March 2019 asking to remit payment of the Award.61 De Jes\u00fas replies that Venezuela has received no official communication as to the enforcement.62 It is possible to conclude from these exchanges that implementing a spontaneous enforcement of the Award was not a high priority between the Parties, as evidenced by the Conoco Parties' concomitant action for recognition of the Award before the US District Court of the District of Columbia, also on 11 March 2019.\n\n*OI European Group B.V. v.

In this immediate regard, one *ad hoc* Committee remarked that post-award interests compensate for the deprivation of the principal until payment of the award, but are not directly related to the issue of enforcement of the award.64 Before we turn to the Parties' more substantive arguments, it is noteworthy that the absence of prejudice is not the starting point whether or not to grant a stay of execution as there is nothing in the ICSID Convention to normally deprive the award creditor of the fruits of its victory in the absence of good reasons. Otherwise, the ICSID Convention would have laid down the reverse rule that an action on annulment automatically activates suspension of enforcement.\n\n\"What would be the specific prejudice of deferring enforcement of the Award to a later date having regard to Venezuela's alleged refusal or inability to honour any award presently and to the freezing of its assets in the US?\" (Question n\u00b0 3), 3 April 2020.\n\n*Kardassopoulos,* \u00b6 43 (A/CLA-10). See also, *Tenaris I*, \u00b6 91 (A/CLA-19).\n\n48.\n\nCurtis points out that this case has been pending for almost thirteen years and, in any event, the annulment proceeding is likely to be resolved by 2021.65 The Conoco Parties retort that Venezuela's position regarding the absence of harm because of delayed payment is \"mystifying\"66 and that Venezuela's procedural attitude in the arbitration which lasted over eleven years has already postponed the reparation of the unlawful expropriation of Conoco's investment.67 How long the debt has been outstanding is an element worthy of consideration for a stay and Curtis' remark that the Conoco Parties preferred to gamble on the arbitration to get a windfall rather than accept generous offers of compensation68 is not an appropriate justification to further deferring the payment of claims which have been made thirteen years ago.\n\nCurtis' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6 19.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, p. 59 :14.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Submission of 4 February 2020, \u00b6 3.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, pp. 34:18-25, 35: 1-4.\n\n49.\n\nWe now move to examine whether there are justifications for preventing the Conoco Parties from realizing their right to enforcement to its full extent by continuing the stay until a decision is made on annulment.\n\n3) The amount of compensation ordered in the Award and Venezuela's economic situation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nA stay will be refused where the execution of the award would not substantially prejudice the Applicant's interest. Venezuela argues here that lifting the stay of enforcement of the Award would run the risk of causing irreparable harm.69 The Committee disagrees with the Conoco Parties which maintain that ICSID awards are enforceable immediately and not only in periods of economic prosperity or of corruption-free governments.70 Quite to the contrary, the financial situation of the award debtor is a circumstance which may justify a stay if enforcement would manifestly have excessive consequences. Some *ad hoc* committees spoke in this regard of catastrophic immediate and irreversible consequences.71\n\nCurtis' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6 23; De Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6 10, English Transcripts, pp. 22: 20-25, 23: 1-17.\n\nTranscripts, p. 64: 23-25.\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment v.

De Jes\u00fas contends that a stay would allow Venezuela to better organize its economy to comply with the Award, if not annulled.84 No further elements were made in support of the later contention, so that it is apparent that the duration of these annulment proceedings would not allow Venezuela to collect specific funds for the satisfaction of the Award.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, pp. 33: 1-23.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6 75.\n\n54.\n\nIf we follow this line of argumentation on Venezuela's financial condition, the issue would be more about Venezuela's impossibility to pay the amounts of the Award than about a limited deferral of payment pending these proceedings. Venezuela has not proven that enforcement before a decision on annulment will cause more catastrophic consequences which did not already exist. The problem by far exceeds the question of a continuation of the stay which the Committee has to resolve. The answer is not so much in the hands of the Committee, but in those of the competent enforcement court or authority mentioned at Article 54(3) of the ICSID Convention which may decide on a stay or adjustments of payment in circumstances permitted by the laws concerning the execution of judgements that would not be inconsistent with the ICSID Convention.\n\n55.\n\nIt is not the task of the Committee to review the continuation of the provisional stay in the abstract but to examine the specific issues raised in the case by an immediate enforcement of the Award for deciding, in its discretion, whether or not to continue with the stay.\n\n4) The prospects of effective enforcement of the Award\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThree days after the notification of the Award on 8 March 2019, the Conoco Parties initiated recognition proceedings in the US District Court of the District of Columbia, which have since been stayed in light of the provisional stay issued by the Secretary-General of ICSID in connection with the Applications for Annulment.85 Besides, the Conoco Parties begun enforcement proceedings before the English High Court in May 2019 and the registration Order was later served on Venezuela in September 2019.86\n\nCurtis' Letter of 14 April 2020, p. 1. English Transcripts, p. 75: 2-10.\n\n\"What enforcement actions (if any) did the Conoco Parties take after the Award was rendered until enforcement was stayed by the Secretary-General of ICSID upon registration of the Application for Annulment?

De Jes\u00fas submits that, since \"the United States judiciary [sic] has stayed all cases submitted by the Republic's creditors\", until a decision from the United States Supreme Court is rendered there will be no \"elbowing\" of award creditors in enforcement proceedings in the United States.88 The Conoco Parties reply that this would be shorter than the expected duration of the annulment proceedings89 and, finally, informed on 23 July 2020, that the court imposed stays in the US have now been lifted or expired on a number of actions brought by Venezuela's award creditors. The Conoco Parties also informed on 23 July 2020 that OFAC has now granted them authorization to enforce the Award,90 but declined Venezuela's invitation91 to provide such authorization,92 other than to the Committee *in camera* because of the sensitive information on the targets of their enforcement efforts.93\n\nDe Jes\u00fas Submission of 16 March 2020, \u00b6 79.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Letter of 14 April 2020, \u00b6 28.\n\n\"What steps have the Conoco Parties taken to obtain such license and what is the likelihood that they may be granted one soon?

Curtis stresses that, even if all the US sanctions were lifted, that would make stay even more important as it would not be appropriate to proceed with enforcement of the Award before conclusion of the annulment proceedings.96\n\nEnglish Transcripts, pp. 39: 22-25, 40:1-23.\n\nUS Executive Order 13884 of 5 August 2019.

Curtis refers to the possibility that any OFAC license granted to Conoco could only concern unblocked property outside of the United States.98 The Conoco Parties have no update on the enforcement proceedings in the UK, otherwise, there are no other active enforcement proceedings in other jurisdictions.99\n\nEnglish the Conoco Parties' Letter of 14 April 2020, \u00b6 16; letters of 23 July and 12 August 2020.

We also conclude that Venezuela is prevented from claiming back the money after annulment, should this be the outcome of these proceedings, and is also prevented from entering into any settlement agreement with the Conoco Parties, although we understand that settlement is not what the Respondents on Annulment are interested in at the moment.\n\n62.\n\nUnder circumstances where there are serious doubts about the practicality of enforcement of the Award, Venezuela has not established the concrete harm it would suffer from a refusal to continue the provisional stay of the Award in favor of which the ICSID Convention lays no presumption. If no demonstrated reasons exist that would justify postponing the right of the Conoco Parties to enforcement of the Award, that does not mean that the Conoco Parties should enjoy said right without limitations as we examine below.\n\n63.\n\nThe Conoco Parties allege that any delay in the payment significantly diminishes the likelihood of collection in the circumstances of outstanding and other pending awards against Venezuela,100 however this general remark is rightly answered by Curtis that the OFAC sanctions will also apply to all the other creditors' actions against Venezuela in the United States.101 They now say that an additional stay when other creditors have now the possibility to continue their actions would put them further behind the line of creditors pursuing a limited pool of attachable assets.102 They further allude to their doomed prospects of enforcing the Award in the US because of the improper steps taken by Venezuela to render itself judgment proof in divesting its US based assets to Venezuela and Russia. We therefore trust the Conoco Parties to fully and promptly cooperate in the implementation of this Order.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Submission of 4 February 2020, \u00b6 45.\n\nCurtis' Letter of 14 April 2020, p. 3.

In light of the difficulties of opening an escrow account in relation to funds with a Venezuelan source, the Conoco Parties have offered to earmark funds received during the pendency of the annulment proceedings or to consider other similar protective measures, including an undertaking from their mother company.106 De Jes\u00fas however observes that the Conoco Parties remain silent regarding an authorization from OFAC to place any amounts recovered into a segregated account to repay any funds if the Award is annulled.107 As De Jes\u00fas remarks, the Respondents on annulment are wholly-owned by companies registered in the USA, and the US sanctions program risks Venezuela's ability to recoup any payment made on the Award if it is annulled, the Conoco Parties admit that return of the funds could only be effectuated consistent with their obligations at the time, including under the US sanctions regime.108\n\nThe Conoco Parties' Letter of 14 April 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 31, 32.\n\nEnglish Transcripts, pp. 77: 15-25, 78: 1-6.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas' Submission of 16 March 2020, Jes\u00fas \u00b6 74; The Conoco Parties' Letter of 14 April 2020\u00b6 32.\n\n66.\n\nThe Committee agrees that this raises serious concerns about the Conoco Parties' ability to return any funds paid on the Award, if annulled. The Committee wishes to be fully appraised therefore about the status of the Respondents on Annulment's application to OFAC for \"*authorization to place any amounts recovered into a segregated account and to repay any funds paid on the Award if annulled*\"109 and about the undertaking of ConocoPhillips for its Dutch subsidiaries, the Conoco Parties. In case such authorization has been granted for the funds collected in the US, the Committee holds that the Conoco Parties will provide the document under the conditions set forth in the dispositive section of this Order. For the funds that may be collected outside of the US, the Committee directs the Conoco Parties to indicate the conditions for opening one or more segregated accounts in this regard.

Three Crowns acts as co-counsel for the Claimants. In response to Venezuela\u2019s objection, Mr. Kim resigned. Venezuela now proposes the disqualification of the Remaining Members on the basis that they have been corrupted by Mr. Kim\u2019s \"deplorable conduct\"2 and cannot perform their functions with competence, independence and impartiality.\n\nVenezuela Proposal for Disqualification, 12 June 2022, para. 39.\n\n**PART 2 - BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 3 April 2020, the Original Committee issued an Order on Representation, allowing the continued participation of two parallel sets of counsel for Venezuela, *i.e.,* namely the counsel appointed by Maduro (De Jes\u00fas) and counsel appointed by Guaid\u00f3 (Curtis Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP).\n\n5.\n\nOn 9 April 2020, Venezuela requested reconsideration of the Original Committee\u2019s decision to permit continued participation by Guaid\u00f3 counsel. The Original Committee rejected this request on 15 April 2020.\n\n6.\n\nVenezuela then applied to disqualify all three members of the Committee on 16 April 2020 which was rejected on 23 July 2020.\n\n7.\n\nOn 3 August 2020, Venezuela again asked the Original Committee to reconsider its Order on Representation of 3 April 2020. The request was again rejected on 2 November 2020. On the same date, the Original Committee decided to lift the stay of enforcement of the 8 March 2019 Award provided the Claimants met certain conditions and provided certain assurances.\n\n8.\n\nOn 21 September 2021, Venezuela asked the Original Committee to reconsider the decision on reconsideration dated 2 November 20203 and by further application dated 4 October 2021 asked the Original Committee to reconsider its decision to lift the stay of enforcement.4\n\nSee **Exhibit R-DISQ2-3,** Venezuela\u2019s Request for Reconsideration, 21 September 2021.\n\nSee **Exhibit R-DISQ2-4,** Venezuela\u2019s Request for Reconsideration, 4 October 2021.\n\n9.\n\nAs of March 2022, the latter applications remained outstanding as a result of the suspension of the annulment proceeding following Venezuela\u2019s failure to pay the required advance on costs.\n\n10.\n\nOn 14 March 2022, the day on which the proceedings resumed after Venezuela\u2019s payment of the advance on costs, the ICSID Secretariat conveyed the following message from Mr. Kim:\n\n\"During the suspension of the proceedings, I was retained to act as co-counsel in a new matter (a commercial arbitration) alongside Three Crowns, which is acting as co-counsel with Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in this case. The background of this new matter has absolutely no bearing with the facts of the Conoco case, and I am convinced that my ability to exercise independent and impartial judgment would not be impaired. Nonetheless. I do not wish to disrupt the proceedings.

Brill (1972), p. 344.\n\n20.\n\nIn this connection, Venezuela pleads Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules which requires all members of arbitral tribunals and annulment committees to sign a declaration attesting their willingness to be bound by a non-limitative set of basic and essential duties in the performance of their mission under the ICSID Convention. In particular, Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules establishes a basic duty \"to judge fairly as between the parties.\"\n\n21.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Rule 8 deals exclusively with mental or physical inability.39 In any event, they say, the Remaining Committee members are perfectly able to \"treat the parties on an equal procedural footing\" unless \"Mr. Kim will breach his professional and ethical obligations\" and \"there is no possible basis for reaching that conclusion.\"40\n\nClaimants' Comments on Proposal, para. 28: [...] As Professor Schreuer explains:  \nIncapacity relates to a mental or physical inability to participate in the commission\u2019s or tribunal\u2019s work for reasons of health. It does not relate to a supervening conflict of interest or to the conciliator\u2019s or arbitrator's inability to find the time to participate in the commission\u2019s or tribunal\u2019s work. These contingencies would call for a resignation.  \nArbitration Rule 8 extends the procedure for the disqualification of an arbitrator to cases of incapacity...'\n\nClaimants' Comments on Proposal, para. 29.\n\n**PART 4 - ANALYSIS**\n---------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe starting point is Article 57 of the ICSID Convention which provides, of course, that disqualification of committee members may be sought \"on account of **any fact** indicating a **manifest** lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\"41 (emphasis added) including competence, independence and impartiality.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 57(emphasis added). Article 14(1), in turn, requires that members of the Panel of Arbitrators shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law. commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\" Although the text of Article 57 refers to disqualification applications made against members of tribunals, it also governs applications to disqualify members of ad hoc committees. Under Arbitration Rule 53, the Rules apply mutatis mutandis to annulment proceedings; in turn, Rule 9(1) incorporates Article 57 in reference to disqualification applications against ad hoc committee members. See ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1) (A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator [or ad hoc committee member] pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.\").\n\n23.\n\nLeaving aside for the moment the meaning of \"manifest\", the prior question is what are the facts? The assessment is to be made from the perspective of a reasonable third person, *i.e.* it is an objective test rather than as viewed subjectively by Venezuela or the Claimants.\n\n24.\n\nVenezuela argues that although Mr. Kim is \"formally excluded from the case [he] remains present42 in the context of the case.\" This is only true if by \"present\" Venezuela means his earlier participation cannot be expunged from the minds of his former colleagues. However, Venezuela does not allege any \"deplorable act\" or other impropriety against Mr. Kim prior to his connection with Three Crowns. That connection did not occur until \"the suspension of proceedings.\"43 There is thus no basis for the reasonable third party to infer prejudice to Venezuela from whatever earlier discussion Mr. Kim held with the Remaining Members.\n\nProposal for Disqualification of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, para. 10.\n\n**Exhibit R-DISQ2-6,** 14 March 2022.\n\n25.\n\nMoreover, the significance of accepting Venezuela\u2019s argument on this point would be to set the stage for disqualification of the Remaining Members of any Tribunal or Annulment Committee whenever one member resigns or is disqualified. This would be because the Remaining Members would be deemed to lack \"independence\" from the \"corrupting\" views of the departing member, or cannot be expected to go forward impartially because their \"future considerations\" would forever be tainted by \"past\" exposure to the views (whatever they might be) of the departing member. The reasonable third person would consider such an outcome to be devoid of any foundational \"fact\" within the meaning of Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n26.\n\nOn the \"unequal footing\" point, Venezuela alleges as a fact that Mr. Kim has disclosed44 to Three Crowns the \"opinions and sensitivities of the [Remaining Members] [...] on each and every [...] argument.\"45 This is a bare allegation. Venezuela offers no justification even for suspicion except its notion that Mr. Kim\u2019s conduct in agreeing to work on an unrelated matter with Three Crowns is \"deplorable\" and (it seems) one deplorable act can be expected to lead to another, especially where, Venezuela says, the mere \"prospect\" of such an unauthorized disclosure is a sufficient basis to disqualify the Remaining Members. However, there are no facts (nor does Venezuela even offer a plausible version of relevant circumstances) which might lead the reasonable third person to infer the existence or even the appearance of a risk of improper disclosure of confidential information to Three Crowns. Mr. Kim made a business decision to work with Three Crowns on an unrelated commercial matter, a decision with which Venezuela strongly disagrees, but Venezuela provides no reason to suspect on that basis that Mr. Kim has acted or may act unprofessionally in breach of his duty of confidentiality and in violation of the Undertaking he gave when accepting his appointment as Member of the Annulment Committee.\n\nProposal for Disqualification of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, para. 41.\n\nProposal for Disqualification of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, paras. 9, 40, 48.\n\n27.\n\nThis lack of substance to the allegation of wrongful disclosure also disposes of the \"unequal footing\" argument because if there is no violation of confidentiality, Conoco counsel have no special advantage or insight into the thinking of the Remaining Members and are thus on equal footing with counsel for the Claimants.\n\n28.\n\nLeaving aside the allegations against Mr. Kim, Venezuela\u2019s case against the Remaining Members must be read in light of Venezuela\u2019s affirmation that \"the Republic is mindful that Judge Hascher and Professor Fernandez Arroyo may still nurture the intention and the candid belief to serve with full independence and impartiality despite the deplorable conduct of Mr. Kim and the Conoco Parties' Counsel\"46 although \"unfortunately, in spite of their best and sincere intentions and beliefs, there is simply nothing that the Remaining Members of the Original Committee can do to reverse or remedy this situation.\"47 This is \"not because they do not intend to remain independent and impartial as individuals *in abstracto,* but because, *in concreto,* they do not have the power to restore the integrity of the Original Committee.\"48\n\nProposal for Disqualification of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, para. 16.\n\nProposal for Disqualification of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, para. 12.\n\nProposal for Disqualification of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, para. 17.\n\n29.\n\nIt is important to note, therefore, that Venezuela does not impugn the integrity of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo. Nor does Venezuela question the good faith of their declaration of 11 May 2022 that they \"intend to continue serving in these annulment proceedings in fulfillment of their duties under the ICSID Convention with all independence and impartiality.\"49 However, Venezuela says they must be disqualified because they will conduct future deliberations \"in light of their past considerations\"50 and are members of a panel deemed to be corrupted (retrospectively) by Mr. Kim\u2019s \"deplorable\"51 conduct in March 2022.\n\n**Exhibit R-DISQ2-11,** Communication from the Remaining Members of the Original Committee in response to the Letter from Attorney General Mr. Reinaldo Muiioz Pedroza of 29 April 2022, 11 May 2022.\n\nProposal for Disqualification of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, para. 50.\n\nProposal for Disqualification of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, para. 16.\n\n30.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s notion that the Remaining Members \"do not have the power to restore the integrity of the Original Committee\" presupposes that the integrity of the Original Committee has been compromised but Venezuela has offered no \"facts\" within the meaning of Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention or other objective justification for such a conclusion.\n\n31.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Remaining Members will not expunge from their brains \"past considerations\" but there is no reason to do so because, as earlier mentioned, no imputation of impropriety or conduct prejudicial to Venezuela is made against Mr. Kim prior to his March 2022 association with Three Crowns. There is no allegation that the \"past deliberations\" were tainted by the participation of Mr. Kim and therefore there is no \"taint\" to carry forward into \"future deliberations\" to Venezuela\u2019s disadvantage.\n\n32.\n\nAs to the allegation of bias arising out of the Remaining Members \"laconic\"52 and \"frivolous\"53 written response to the complaint of Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General, there is nothing in the ICSID Convention or Arbitration Rules (or the particular facts of this case) to require a detailed response to the demand for resignation. Even in Venezuela\u2019s letter of 7 July 2022, it is conceded that the joint communication of 29 June 2022 of the Remaining Committee furnishing explanations on the Proposal for Disqualification:\n\n\"falls within the practice of challenged adjudicators to refrain from providing any explanation although Rule 9(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules is an invitation that they do so. However established, such a practice does not in any manner foster justice or the integrity of the ICSID system, it aims only at hindering the adversarial nature of the disqualification process and at transforming Rule 9(3) into a shield in order for the challenged adjudicators to protect themselves.\"54\n\nProposal for Disqualification of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, para. 15.\n\nProposal for Disqualification of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, para. 15.\n\n7 July 2022 letter, p. 2.\n\n33.\n\nVenezuela takes issue with the usual practice of challenged arbitrators. This may be a matter for debate in *abstracto* but in the circumstances of this case, no reasonable third party would construe conformity with the usual practice to be evidence of bias. Moreover, in my opinion, the allegations are so lacking in particularity or any factual foundation it is difficult to know what more the Remaining Members could have said except to affirm their independence and impartiality.\n\n34.\n\nVenezuela makes an alternative argument under Rule 8(1) which provides:\n\n\"(1) If an arbitrator becomes incapacitated or unable to perform the duties of his office, the procedure in respect of the disqualification of arbitrators set forth in Rule 9 shall apply.\"\n\n35.\n\nVenezuela does not allege physical incapacity but argues that each of the Remaining Members are \"unable to perform the duties of his office\" because they \"will question each and every of their future considerations in light of their past considerations and the prospect that the latter are known by the Conoco Parties.\"55 The Remaining Members are thus trapped by the past participation with Mr. Kim and \"in spite of their best and sincere intentions and beliefs there is simply nothing that the Remaining Members of the Original Committee can do to reverse or remedy this situation.\"56 However, as discussed, the allegations of impropriety on the part of the Remaining Members or the existence of some \"taint\" by prior association with Mr. Kim lack any foundation in fact and viewing the same allegations under Rule 8(1) does not add anything to Venezuela\u2019s main argument under Article 57.\n\nVenezuela Proposal for Disqualification, para. 50.\n\nVenezuela Proposal for Disqualification, paras. 12, 16 and 17.\n\n36.\n\nIn the circumstances, it is not necessary to stress the limiting word \"manifest\" in Article 14(1) as discussed in *Blue Bank v*. *Venezuela* because Venezuela has failed to show that the Remaining Members lack independence and impartiality much less \"manifestly\" lack independence and impartiality. Accordingly, the extra requirement that this lack be \"manifest\" is not a significant consideration in the analysis.\n\n**PART 5 - RECOMMENDATION**\n---------------------------\n\n37.\n\nVenezuela proposes disqualification on the grounds that:\n\n\"the situation created by Mr. Kim and the Conoco Parties' Counsel has irremediably corrupted the integrity of these annulment proceedings as a whole, the works of the Annulment Committee as a collegial body and, by way of correspondence, the ability of the Remaining Members of the Original Committee to fulfill their duties in accordance with the ICSID Convention. Mr. Kim's departure from the case does not cure the irreparable damage that has been caused to the case.\"57\n\nVenezuela Proposal for Disqualification, para. 8.\n\n38.\n\nIn my opinion, for the reasons stated above there is nothing in Venezuela\u2019s allegations against the Remaining Members to suggest a lack of competence, independence or impartiality (let alone a \"manifest\" lack) or an appearance of such a lack in the eye of a reasonable third person.\n\n39.\n\nMy recommendation is therefore that Venezuela\u2019s proposal to disqualify Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo be dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision of the Chairman of the Administrative Council on the Disqualification of Judge Dominique Hascher and Professor Diego Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2022-09-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision of the Chairman of the Administrative Council on the Disqualification of Judge Dominique Hascher and Professor Diego Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1].\n\nDear Mesdames and Sirs,\n\n[2].\n\nI refer to the Proposal for the Disqualification of Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo filed on June 12, 2022 by De Jes\u00fas Law Firm on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the \"Proposal\").\n\n[3].\n\nThe Proposal was submitted pursuant to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis is a summary of the procedural background leading to the issuance of this Order, and it does not purport to contain a full report of each procedural step undertaken by the Parties and the *ad hoc* Committee in this annulment proceeding.\n\n2.\n\nOn 3 April 2020, the Committee issued an \"Order on the Applicant's Representation,\" rejecting the request presented on 15 March 2020 by the law firm De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas (\"De Jes\u00fas\") on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"Venezuela\" or the \"Republic\") that the Committee exclude from this annulment proceeding the participation of the law firm Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP (\"Curtis\"), who also appeared acting on behalf of Venezuela.\n\n3.\n\nOn 9 April 2020, Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) requested that the Committee reconsider its 3 April Order (\"**First request**\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, the Committee denied Venezuela's First request for reconsideration and reminded the parties that its 3 April Order was \"limited to the present stage of the proceedings and is subject to review in light of future developments.\"\n\n5.\n\nOn 16 April 2020, Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) filed a proposal to disqualify the entire Committee. The proceeding was suspended until 10 August 2020, when the Chairman of the Administrative Council dismissed the disqualification proposal, following a recommendation to that effect made by The Rt. Hon. Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, K.G.\n\n6.\n\nOn 3 August 2020, Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) filed a second request that the Committee reconsider its 3 April Order (\"**Second request**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn 2 November 2020, after hearing the parties and holding a hearing by videoconference on 30 September 2020, the Committee issued an \"Order on the Applicant's Request for Reconsideration dated 3 August 2020 on the issue of Venezuela's legal representation.\" The Committee rejected De Jes\u00fas' Second request for reconsideration.\n\n8.\n\nOn 21 September 2021, Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) filed a third request asking the Committee to reconsider its Order of 2 November 2020 (\"**Third request**\").\n\n9.\n\nUpon an invitation from the Committee, on 23 September 2021 Curtis submitted their comments on the Third request on behalf of Venezuela and the Conoco Parties submitted their comments on 27 September 2021.\n\n10.\n\nFrom 14 October 2021 to 14 March 2022 the annulment proceeding was suspended for lack of payment of the required advance.\n\n11.\n\nFrom 18 March 2022 to 1 June 2022 the proceeding was again suspended, while the vacancy left upon resignation of one of the Committee Members (Mr. Kim) was filled (by Mr. Boo) and the Committee was reconstituted with its current composition.\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 June 2022, Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) filed a proposal to disqualify two of the Committee Members (Judge Hascher and Prof. Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo). The proceeding was suspended until 27 September 2022, when the Chairman of the Administrative Council dismissed the disqualification proposal, following a recommendation to that effect made by Judge Ian Binnie.\n\n13.\n\nUpon an invitation from the Committee to update their respective submissions on the issue of the representation, on 15 December 2022 Curtis replied on behalf of Venezuela that \"we see no changes in the situation and have no further comment;\" on 16 December 2022, the Conoco Parties replied that they \"have no further observations, as there has been no relevant change of circumstances. If the relevant circumstances do change, however, the Claimants will respond to any renewed application made;\" and De Jes\u00fas on behalf of Venezuela replied that \"the Republic fully reiterates the content of its previous submissions [\u2026] and confirms it has no further comment. The Republic's communication is made without prejudice to its objection on the continued participation of Curtis in these proceedings [\u2026]\"\n\n**II. ANALYSIS OF THE AD-HOC COMMITTEE**\n----------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Committee deals with Venezuela's (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) Third request of 21 September 2021, asking the Committee to reconsider the 2 November 2020 Reconsideration Order on Representation.\n\n15.\n\nVenezuela (as represented by Curtis) and the Conoco Parties replied respectively on 23 and 27 September 2021 upon the Committee's invitation of 22 September 2021. The Parties' latest submissions of 16 and 21 December 2022 informed the Committee that they had no further comments to make since September 2021.\n\n16.\n\nThe Committee would like to clarify from the outset that the 2 November 2020 Order merely rejected Venezuela's (as represented by De Jesus) request for reconsideration of the Order on Representation of 3 April 2020 which decided not to exclude Curtis, instructed by the Special Attorney General, from the annulment proceedings.\n\n17.\n\nThe Committee recalls that the annulment proceedings were launched by the Republic of Venezuela (as represented by Curtis) on 27 November 2019. Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) wishes to exclude from these proceedings \"*any third party claiming to represent the interests of the Republic by alleging to be the so-called special attorney and any other third party claiming to be instructed by the so-called special attorney, namely Curtis*\".1 The annulment proceedings have only opposed the two Parties which were involved in the underlying arbitration that led to the Award of 8 March 2019: the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Conoco Parties. There are no other parties involved before us.\n\nThird request, p. 8.\n\n18.\n\nTwo post-November 2020 events should, according to Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas), determine this Committee to exclude Curtis from representing Venezuela.\n\n\u2022 The first event is Decree No. 4.431 signed by President Maduro on 5 February 2021 which appoints Mr. Pedroza as Attorney General of the Republic following the authorization of the National Assembly on 4 February 2021 (Annex 2). It is not disputed that Mr. Pedroza instructs the firm of De Jes\u00fas for these proceedings.\n\n\u2022 The second event is the Agreement of the National Assembly of 6 July 2021, published in the Official Gazette on 2 September 2021, that \"*determines and warns the fraud against the Law, the Constitution and International public law as a consequence of the inexistence, ineffectiveness, and invalidity of the simulated Agreements dated 12 September 2018, 19 March 2019, 10 December 2019, and 28 April 2020 whereby it was pretended to disregard Mr. Attorney General of the Republic, as well as the system of norms on legal advice and legal defense of the Republic, both nationally and internationally*\". 2\n\nThird request, Annex I.\n\n19.\n\nAs a result of these two events, Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) stresses that the Agreement of the National Assembly of 28 April 2020 on the Refusal of the Judgment of the Illegitimate Constitutional Chamber of 22 April 2020 is without foundation anymore for the Committee's Decision of 2 November 2020.\n\n20.\n\nThe Agreement of the National Assembly of 28 April 2020, which was effectively mentioned at para. 30 of the Decision, has been declared null and void by article 3 of the Agreement of the National Assembly of 6 July 2021.3 Article 4 of the same further establishes that the Judgments of the Constitutional Chamber of 22 April and 30 December 2020 ruled on the nullity of all acts of the 2016-2021 National Assembly, particularly those leading to the usurpation of the powers of representation of Mr. Pedroza.\n\nThird request, Annex I.\n\n21.\n\nThe Committee indicated in the 2 November 2020 Decision:\n\n*\"The chronology of actions taken by the judicial and legislative branches of Venezuela indicates that each of these Constitutional powers has systematically thwarted the other's decision regarding the office of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez. If the Committee were to exclude Curtis each time the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court makes an adverse pronouncement to Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez, there would be some logic in readmitting Curtis each time the National Assembly passes a resolution affirming Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez's powers. As of today, the Committee notes that the National Assembly has had the last word by declaring on 28 April 2020 the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court an illegitimate body whose judgments since 23 December 2015 are without effect or force, including the Judgment of 22 April 2020. The Committee cannot see how the procedural interests of Venezuela would be served by having a swing-wing representation dependent upon the vagaries of the quest of power in Venezuela\" (para. 39).*\n\n22.\n\nThe Committee sees no reason to depart from its earlier position regarding the chronology of events which was referred to in the Decision of 2 November 2020 as an illustration that the stacking of decisions enacted by the various branches of Government was not a solution to the issue of representation in these proceedings.\n\n23.\n\nVenezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) nonetheless insists that, following the post-November 2020 events, the Committee is no more confronted to a situation where it would need to \"*vindicate the actions of one branch of the Constitutional powers over the actions of another branch*\" or to a \"*swing-wing representation*\" situation.4 It incites us to declare Mr. Pedroza the sole legal representative of Venezuela. If we followed that route, we would be confronted to the recognition of Mr. Guaid\u00f3 or of Mr. Maduro as head of State, which our decision would necessarily entail: if Mr. Guaid\u00f3 is the President of Venezuela, the appointment of a Special Attorney is valid. To the contrary, if Mr. Maduro is the President of Venezuela, the Special Attorney's appointment is invalid.\n\nOrder of 2 November 2020, paras. 37-38.\n\n24.\n\nWe do not dispute that De Jes\u00fas, as instructed by Mr. Pedroza, has a power of attorney to represent Venezuela in these proceedings. As we already pointed out in the 2 November 2020 Decision, 5 our refusal to recognize which individual is the constitutional president of Venezuela cannot be regarded as an attack on the sovereignty of Venezuela as a continuing State. We add that the sovereignty of a State would be at stake before an international adjudicative body, such as an *ad hoc* committee, under the sovereign immunity doctrine, which is not an issue presently.\n\nOrder of 2 November 2020, para. 40.\n\n25.\n\nThe Committee's Decision of 2 November 2020 rests on the following passage at para. 39: \"*Failing any demonstration that Venezuela's representation should be in the hands of De Jes\u00fas, to the exclusion of Curtis, for the preservation of Venezuela's rights to accede to justice, the Request for reconsideration of 3 August 2020 is rejected,*\" to which we now turn for considering Venezuela's arguments in support of excluding Curtis based on procedural considerations.\n\n26.\n\nIt is contended that Venezuela's procedural interests and rights militate to exclude any representation by Curtis and the latter's silence on the Stay of Enforcement is cited as a supportive argument of the reasoning proposed6. We have difficulty in following the allegation that such absence of submissions on the conditions to lift the stay should be regarded as an approval of the Conoco Parties' position. None of our decisions on the lift of the stay ever implied that kind of endorsement. We further note that Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) applies to exclude Curtis from all these proceedings, including the stay issue. It cannot, without contradiction, at the same time complain that Curtis has not helped in opposing the Conoco Parties' efforts to lift the stay. We do not know what were the reasons for Venezuela's (as represented by Curtis) abstention, but it could not have hampered the defense of Venezuela's (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) position, who was at liberty to argue in favor of the stay without the risk of being contradicted by Curtis. On that count, Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) cannot raise a bicephalous position, an argument to which we now turn.\n\nThird request, p. 2.\n\n27.\n\nVenezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) more generally alleges that Curtis' participation \"*has rendered these highly technical proceedings unnecessary difficult [\u2026] by the proliferation of submissions that provides the Conoco Parties with space to benefit from the Republic's allegedly contradictory bicephalous position*\".7. Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) inserts a footnote in that part of their Third request to the extent that the \"*Conoco Parties have brought to the Republic's attention that they had reached an agreement with Curtis, as instructed by the so-called 'special attorney', in procedural matters related to the Hearing on Annulment*\".8\n\nThird request, p. 2.\n\nThird request, footnote 3.\n\n28.\n\nThe footnote does not identify the alleged incident. The Committee is left to guess that the footnote may probably allude to the preparation of the hearing in September 2021. The Conoco Parties wrote on 13 September 2021 about the draft procedural order of the Hearing: \"*The Claimants respectfully submit the attached Word document reflecting the Claimants' proposed revisions to the draft Procedural Order no. 2. Counsel for Venezuela at Curtis has stated its agreement with this proposal.*\" This reply fulfilled the Committee's invitation of 27 August 2021 inviting the Parties to confer and transmit their joint comments on the draft procedural order (or their respective positions in case of disagreement). We have no indication regarding how the above comments made on a draft procedural order could have advantaged the Conoco Parties to the detriment of the Applicant. Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) filed its own comments on the draft procedural order and all observations made were taken into consideration by the Committee before Procedural Order No. 2 on the organization of the hearing was issued on 29 September 2021. We add here that, because the proceedings were suspended on 14 October 2021 for lack of payment of the advance required under ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and (e), the Hearing scheduled during the week of 25 October 2021, consequently, did not take place. Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) does not demonstrate in which manner the above narrated events concerning Procedural Order No. 2 of 29 September 2021 that has now become obsolete, have hampered its position, or disorganized its defense in these proceedings.\n\n29.\n\nBoth representations of Venezuela by Curtis and De Jes\u00fas seek the annulment of the Award. We relate to the bicephalous defense argument, Curtis' reply of 23 September 2021 that \"[o]*ur only observation is that Mr. De Jesus should be grateful that we are here to present the case for annulment.*\"9 While we will not engage here in a debate on the respective quality of the submissions filed, we may only take note, that aside from the above footnote, we have no indication from Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) as to how Curtis' submissions in support of the Application for Annulment, filed by Curtis before its duplication by De Jes\u00fas, might have concretely prejudiced in any way Venezuela's defense. Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) avers that with Curtis' representation \"*the Republic will continue to suffer the detrimental consequences of the unlawful and wrongful actions purportedly made on its behalf*\". 10 Such general declaration does not establish how, in the present annulment proceedings, its right of defense has been breached or which rule of natural justice has been infringed to the detriment of Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas), let alone the \"*great harm to the Republic's procedural interests and rights of defense*\"11 purportedly suffered by it.\n\nCurtis' email (on behalf of Venezuela) of 23 September 2021.\n\nThird request, p. 8.\n\nThird request, p. 2.\n\n**III. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n30.\n\nIn light of the above considerations, we conclude that the 21 September 2021 Request to reconsider the Reconsideration Order on Representation of 2 November 2020 has not demonstrated that the preservation of Venezuela's effective exercise of the right to present its case has been prejudiced by Curtis' involvement (see Order of 2 November 2020, para. 39).\n\n31.\n\nWe, therefore, maintain today our Decision of 3 April 2020.\n\n32.\n\nAll questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Committee and of the Parties in connection with this application are reserved for subsequent determination, together with the Application for Annulment."}, {"Title": "Order on the Applicant\u2019s Request for Reconsideration of the Decision of 29 September 2021 Discontinuing the Stay of Enforcement", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2023-02-15T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Order on the Applicant\u2019s Request for Reconsideration of the Decision of 29 September 2021 Discontinuing the Stay of Enforcement\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

The Republic's communication is made without prejudice to [\u2026] its objection on the lifting of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\"\n\n**II. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n---------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nWe write in reply to the letter of 4 October 2021 from Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) following the Committee's Decision of 29 September 2021 on the fulfilment of the second condition for the discontinuation of the stay.\n\n11.\n\nVenezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) was offered on 6 December 2022 an opportunity to update its arguments for reconsideration and replied on 21 December 2022 only to reiterate the contents of its earlier submission and confirm it had no further comments.\n\n12.\n\nUpon the Committee's invitation of 8 October 2021, the Conoco Parties' filed observations on 13 October 2021 and, in reply to the Committee's further invitation of 6 December 2022, indicated on 16 December 2022 to maintain their position to reject the reconsideration request, having nothing to add provided there was no relevant change of circumstances.\n\n13.\n\nVenezuela (as represented by Curtis), which did not submit observations before on this issue, informed the Committee on 16 December 2022 that it had no further comment, seeing no changes of situation.\n\n14.\n\nVenezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) expresses in its letter of 4 October 2021 a general disagreement with the Committee's view about the implementation of the second condition for lifting the stay in the Decision of 2 November 2020.\n\n15.\n\nThe Committee's communication of 26 July 2021, cited by Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) in its letter of 4 October (p. 4) reads: \"*We turn now to the second condition of the Decision of 2 November 2020 regarding the opening of one or more segregated accounts for the funds collected outside of the US. The Conoco Parties have indicated in their letter of 17 June 2021 that the ConocoPhillips Company has applied to open six accounts with the London branch of Bank of America. Venezuela observes in its letters of 30 June and 23 July 2021 that no concrete details of the conditions for the opening of these accounts have been provided. We invite the Conoco Parties to inform the Committee accordingly*\".\n\n16.\n\nThe Conoco Parties' letter of 17 June 2021 mentioned: \"With respect to the status of the segregated account referred to in the second condition of the Decision on the Stay of Enforcement dated 2 November 2020, ConocoPhillips Company has applied to open six such accounts with the London branch of Bank of America (one US dollar denominated account and one Euro-denominated account for each of the three Claimants), for the deposit of any funds collected through enforcement of the Award rendered in this case, dated 8 March 2019 (as rectified 29 August 2019) (the Award). Those accounts will contain only the funds collected through enforcement of the Award and will not be dissipated during the pendency of the annulment proceedings, except with respect to account maintenance fees, which will be replenished in the event of annulment and repayment. The bank's standard compliance checks are ongoing (given that Venezuela would be the source of any funds deposited), and the Claimants will update the Committee as more details become available\" (p. 3).\n\n17.\n\nWe cannot find in the language of our above cited communication of 26 July 2021 any hint that \"the Second Condition could not be satisfied with the five elements informed by the Conoco Parties until the conditions for the segregated accounts would be disclosed\" as Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) advances in its letter of 4 October (p. 5), namely the beneficiaries, numbers, currency denomination of the accounts, designation of the financial institution, advised by the Conoco Parties in their letter of 17 June 2021.\n\n18.\n\nVenezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) requires documentary support regarding the terms and conditions for the opening of the segregated accounts and indicates that such terms and conditions agreed by the Conoco Parties \"*unilaterally and behind closed doors with the London branch of bank of America*\" will not allow Venezuela to recoup any funds (letter of 4 October, p. 7).\n\n19.\n\nIt bears recalling that the Decision of 2 November 2020 requested from the Conoco Parties \"*the conditions for opening one or more segregated accounts for the funds collected outside of the United States*\" (para. 67.2)). This language must be read against the backdrop of the US sanctions regime for Venezuela (see paras. 65-67 of the Decision of 2 November 2020). Without a possibility for the Conoco Parties to open segregated accounts for the award monies outside the United States, lifting the stay would be an ineffective measure.\n\n20.\n\nFollowing the Committee's invitation on 26 May 2021 to \"*provide concrete details of the segregated account(s)*\" which the Conoco Parties announced their intention to open in their letter of 22 January 2021 (p. 2), the disclosure by the Conoco Parties in their letter of 17 May 2021 that they had applied to open six segregated accounts with the London branch of the Bank of America, that the Bank's compliance checks were ongoing and that they would update as more details become available (p. 3) prompted the Committee's reaction on 26 July 2021 for more information.\n\n21.\n\nThe Conoco Parties indicated in their letter of 17 June 2021 that the \"*bank's standard compliance check is ongoing (given that Venezuela would be the source of any funds deposited*\" (p. 3) and informed on 8 September 2021 that the compliance process had been completed. Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) speaks of \"*unsupported declarations*\" regarding the compliance process followed with the Bank (letter of 4 October, p. 5).\n\n22.\n\nIt is undisputed that six segregated accounts were opened by the Conoco Parties with the London branch of Bank of America. This event necessarily entailed that the compliance process announced in the same letter of 17 June 2021 had been successfully brought to completion. It is reasonable to infer that, otherwise, the operation of the said accounts would not have been possible as signaled by the Conoco Parties in their letter of 30 July 2021 (\"*These accounts are reserved for the Claimants' use in satisfaction of the Committee's second condition, but they are not yet active, which means they cannot receive the funds*\", p. 2).\n\n23.\n\nVenezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) does not mention the possibility that the compliance check may have been in breach of the sanctions regime applying to Venezuela in the United States or the United Kingdom. In the circumstances, we would not learn anything from an alleged supporting documentation regarding the compliance process. We are satisfied, that with the successful opening and activation of the segregated accounts, the lift of the stay became a concrete and effective measure.\n\n24.\n\nThe Committee was also wary in its Decision of 2 November 2020 of the return of the funds to Venezuela in case the award would be annulled. As an example of \"*documentary support*\" and \"*terms and conditions*\", Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) cited \"*for instance*\" information regarding the level of segregation, or the accounts financial and regulatory conditions or the reasons for which two set of accounts in Euro and US dollar were opened for each of the Conoco Parties (letter of 17 September 2021, pp. 3-4).\n\n25.\n\nThe Conoco Parties have provided the banking details of the six segregated accounts which enable the Committee and the Parties to locate the placement of the award monies. The Conoco Parties declared that \"*Those accounts will contain only the funds collected through enforcement of the Award and will not be dissipated during the pendency of the annulment proceedings, except with respect to the maintenance fees, which will be replenished in the event of annulment and repayment*\" (letter of 17 June 2021, p. 3). We first note that there is no evidence that the openings of these accounts would be a sham to defraud Venezuela from recovering the monies deposited in the London branch of the Bank of America. Second, the identification of the accounts, as we already remarked in our Decision of 29 September 2021, provides all the necessary \"*transparency*\" claimed by Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) in its communication of 17 September 2021 and in its letter of 4 October (pp. 5, 7) to protect against dissipation and, thereby, allow recoupment in the case the Conoco Parties would not return the funds voluntarily (notwithstanding the guarantee provided in accordance with the third condition of the 2 November 2020 Decision).\n\n26.\n\nWe fail to see how the preservation of these objectives, and above all, the recoupment stressed by Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) in its letter of 30 June 2021 (p. 14) would be better achieved with the reasons for opening Euro and US Dollar accounts, or information on the level of segregation or else by the financial conditions contracted between the Conoco Parties and the Bank. A concrete demonstration of the link between the necessity of such information and the above stated goals has not been made nor proposed.\n\n27.\n\nVenezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) further develops that the placement of funds in a financial institution connected with the United States and the United Kingdom is inappropriate. When we wrote in our message of 29 September 2021 that \"*if we are correct, we received no indication from Venezuela about the type of financial institution they would regard as acceptable*\" after reminding in the same message that \"*we called on the parties' cooperation in implementing our Decision of 20 November 2020*\", the Committee pointed out that it received from Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) no concrete proposal that would be of assistance in identifying a banking institution or a country considered in Venezuela's (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) eyes as not having \"*led policies against the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*\", according to Venezuela's (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) words in its submission of 17 September 2021.\n\n28.\n\nThe Committee is always willing to explain its approach to the Parties. The above cited passage in our message of 29 September 2021 could not have meant to be an accusation of \"*disloyal behavior*\" as Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) writes in the letter of 4 October (p. 4), but an expression of regret, as we continued in our message of 29 September: \"*We are sorry for this absence of suggestion*\". Absent any constructive proposal on the part of Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) as to which country and bank would be palatable with its policy, we could not move at random from country to country in the hope that Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) would find the politics acceptable. If we acted as such, this would have seriously undermined in our view the efficiency of these proceedings.\n\n29.\n\nWe would now like to remind that, considering the concerns expressed by Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) in its letter of 30 June 2021, we held on 26 July 2021 that the Committee was available for resolving any difficulties, if and when they arise. In its letter of 4 October, Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) urges us to undertake this commitment.\n\n30.\n\nVenezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) expresses in the strongest terms its reservations about the United States and United Kingdom Governments and their judiciaries for their hostile posture against Venezuela and puts emphasis in its letter of 4 October on the impossibility to recoup assets in the United Kingdom. In its letter of 30 June 2021, the concerns voiced by Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) in this regard were expressed in the discussion on the fulfilment of the first condition of the 2 November 2020 Decision (pp. 11-13).\n\n31.\n\nThe second condition is one of the three conditions of the Decision of 2 November 2020 which interact together to preserve the recoupment of the Award monies by Venezuela in case of annulment. The necessity of additional litigation in the courts of the country where the accounts are located is not implied nor expressed by our Decision. The efficiency of the November 2020 measure is backed by the ICISD Convention which gives this Committee the authority to make the necessary orders regarding the implementation of its decisions.\n\n32.\n\nWe observe from the Parties' latest communications of 16 and 21 December 2022 that the situation has not evolved since the discussions that took place in September-October 2021 regarding the reconsideration request. We are led to conclude that no deposit in the London accounts of funds collected outside the US has been effectuated for the moment and that no difficulty encountered on the part of the Bank of America (London Branch) under the compliance process regarding the operation of the accounts upon reception of such funds has been consequently reported.\n\n33.\n\nIn the absence of measures of enforcement of the Award pursuant to the Decision of 2 November 2020, we are left, for the time being, with speculations regarding the likelihood of a breach of Venezuela's (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) right to recoup the Award monies in the London accounts, let alone any materialization of a possible denial of justice as Venezuela (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) reminds us we mentioned in our Decision of 26 July 2021 on the fulfillment of the third condition.\n\n34.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot share Venezuela's (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) views on the non-fulfillment of the second condition.\n\n**III. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n35.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee maintains its decision of 29 September 2021 and, thereby, maintains the lift of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n36.\n\nAll questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Committee and of the Parties in connection with this application are reserved for subsequent determination, together with the Application for Annulment."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2025-01-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**Table of Abbreviations/Defined Terms**\n----------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| November 27 Application | Application for Annulment filed on 27 November 2019 |\n| 5 December Application | Application for Annulment filed on 5 December 2019 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| Award | Award of 8 March 2019 |\n| BIT | Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Republic of Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela which entered into force on 1 November 1993 |\n| A/C-[#] | Exhibit of the Respondents on Annulment |\n| Memorial (Curtis). | Applicant's Memorial dated 26 November 2020 |\n| Memorial (De Jes\u00fas) | Applicant's Memorial dated 26 November 2020 |\n| Reply (Curtis) | Applicant's Reply dated 10 May 2021 |\n| Reply (De Jes\u00fas) | Applicant's Reply dated 10 May 2021 |\n| CL-[#] | Legal Authority of the Respondents on Annulment |\n| Committee | Judge Hascher, Prof. Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, Prof. Boo |\n| Hearing | Hearing on Annulment held on 18 \u2013 20 October 2023 |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| A/R-[#] | Applicant's Exhibit |\n| Counter-Memorial (Conoco) | Counter-Memorial of the Respondents on Annulment dated 24 February 2021 |\n| Rejoinder (Conoco) | Rejoinder of the Respondents on Annulment dated 23 July 2021 |\n| RL-[#] | Applicant's Legal Authority |\n| Tr.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis proceeding concerns an application for annulment (the \"**Application**\") of the award rendered on 8 March 2019, in the arbitration proceeding between ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30) (the \"**Award**\") rendered by a Tribunal composed of Mr. Eduardo Zuleta, Mr. L. Yves Fortier and Mr. Andreas Bucher. This Decision will use the \"**Claimants**\" or \"**Conoco**,\" or the \"**Conoco Parties**\" or the \"**Respondents on Annulment**\" to refer to ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. and the \"**Applicant**\" or \"**Venezuela**\" or the \"**Republic**\" or the \"**Respondent**\" for the Republic of Venezuela. The Conoco Parties and Venezuela are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\" The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i). This Decision will also refer to the separate law firms that hold themselves as the Respondent's representatives, namely the law firm of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP (\"**Curtis**\") on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the law firm De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas (\"**De Jes\u00fas**\"), to distinguish the respective filings submitted by each.\n\n2.\n\nThe Award decided on a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Republic of Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands which entered into force on 1 November 1993 (the \"**BIT**\" or \"**Treaty**\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe dispute in the arbitration proceeding related to the interests of the Claimants in two extra-heavy oil projects located in Venezuela's Orinoco Oil Belt region (Faja Petrol\u00edfera del Orinoco) \u2014 the \"Petrozuata Project\" and the \"Hamaca Project\" (the \"**Upgrading Projects**\"), and in an offshore project for the extraction of light to medium crude oil \u2014 the \"Corocoro Project\" and the subsequent various measures taken by the Respondent.\n\n4.\n\nOn 3 September 2013, the Tribunal issued by majority its Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits. The Tribunal found that the Respondent \"breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation \u2026 on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the [Netherlands-Venezuela] BIT\". On 8 March 2019, the Tribunal issues its Award, ordering the Respondent to pay ca. US$ 8.7 billion for damages and US$ 20.4 million to defray Conoco's arbitration costs.\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent applied for annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, identifying four grounds for annulment: (i) the Tribunal was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a)); (ii) manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b)); (iii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and (iv) failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 27 November 2019, ICSID received an Application for Annulment of the Award (the \"**November 27 Application**\"). Mr. George Kahale, from the law firm Curtis submitted the November 27 Application on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. On 5 December 2019, ICSID received an \"Application for Annulment\" of the same Award (the \"**December 5 Application**\"). Dr. Alfredo De Jes\u00fas O., from the law firm De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas submitted the 6 December Application, also on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Both applications also contained a request under Convention Article 52(5) and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\") for the stay of enforcement of the Awards until the Application was decided (the \"**Request for Stay**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn 16 December 2019, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 50(2), the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application. On the same date, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 54(2), the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the enforcement of the Award had been provisionally stayed.\n\n8.\n\nIn the Applications, the Respondent requested \"that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID seek the recommendation of the President of the International Court of Justice with respect to the appointment of the three members of the *ad hoc* Committee.\" On 17 January 2020, ICSID wrote to the Parties notifying them that (i) \"[t]he authority to appoint the members of an *ad hoc* Committee under the ICSID Convention falls on the Chairman of the Administrative Council. Accordingly, the Chairman will not seek a recommendation from the President of the International Court of Justice\" and (ii) the Chairman intended to appoint Judge Dominique Hascher, Prof. Diego Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, and Mr. Kap-You Kim to the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n9.\n\nOn 3 February 2020, in accordance with Rules 6 and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Parties were notified that an *ad hoc* Committee composed of Judge Dominique Hascher, a national of the Republic of France, and designated as President of the Committee, Professor Diego Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, a national of Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain and Mr. Kap-You Kim, a national of the Republic of Korea, had been constituted (the \"**Committee**\"). On the same date, the Parties were notified that Francisco Grob Duhalde, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n10.\n\nOn 20 February 2020, the Secretary of the Committee circulated a draft procedural order to the Parties in preparation for the first session and the preliminary procedural consultation referred to in Arbitration Rules 13 and 20, respectively.\n\n11.\n\nOn 25 February 2020, the Committee advised the Parties that the first session and the preliminary procedural consultation would be held with the Parties by telephone conference on 25 March 2020.\n\n12.\n\nOn 2 March 2020, De Jes\u00fas, Curtis and the Claimants confirmed their availability on the proposed dates.\n\n13.\n\nOn 13 March 2020, De Jes\u00fas and Claimants submitted their comments and proposals on the draft procedural order circulated on 20 February 2020 and provided their availability. Curtis submitted its comments on 14 March 2020 along with its availability.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing receipt of the Parties' observations on the Committee's communication of 25 February 2020, and in view of the Parties' availability, the Secretary of the Committee informed the Parties on 19 March 2020, that the Committee had decided to separate the first session from the preliminary procedural consultation and that it would hold the first session on 25 March 2020, only among its Members. The consultation on procedural matters would proceed in writing; however, the Parties would have the opportunity to present their views in an oral hearing scheduled for 17 April 2020, to be held by videoconference. In this regard, the Committee asked the Parties for their views on holding the hearing only in English.\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 13(1), the Committee held a first session on 25 March 2020, without the presence of the Parties.\n\n16.\n\nOn the same date, in response to the Committee's communication of 19 March 2020, counsel for the Respondent as represented by Curtis responded that they had no objection to holding the 17 April hearing only in English. Counsel for the Respondent as represented by De Jes\u00fas asked the Committee to consider whether a hearing was necessary \"given the nature of the issues pending for decision before the Committee and in light of the public health crisis.\"\n\n17.\n\nOn 30 March 2020, the Claimants wrote to the Committee in response to the Respondent's (as represented by De Jes\u00fas) request that the hearing be cancelled, asking that the hearing go forward via teleconference rather than videoconference, if necessary.\n\n18.\n\nOn 3 April 2020, the Committee wrote to the Parties informing them that the 17 April hearing would go on as scheduled and requested an agreed protocol for the hearing and the Parties' views on the Draft Order circulated on 20 February 2020, by 10 April 2020.\n\n19.\n\nOn 10 April 2020, Curtis, De Jes\u00fas and the Claimants each submitted their respective views on the Draft Order.\n\n20.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, the Committee considered the Parties' respective views on the Draft Order and decided on the hearing schedule.\n\n21.\n\nOn 16 April 2020, De Jes\u00fas submitted a Proposal for the Disqualification of the entire *ad hoc* Committee. The Proceeding was suspended until the proposal was decided on 23 July 2020. The Parties' submissions and the arbitrators' explanations are summarized in the Chairman of the Administrative Council's Decision, whereby the Proposal was declined, and the proceedings resumed on the same day.\n\n22.\n\nOn 5 August 2020, the Committee invited the Parties to consider the dates of 7, 8, 11, 16, 23, and 24 September for a reconvened hearing. The Parties subsequently provided their availability for the hearing on Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n\n23.\n\nOn 10 August 2020, the Secretary of the Committee circulated the Committee's Annotated Draft Procedural Order No. 1 and requested the Parties indicate by 14 August 2020, whether they wish to add or change anything to it.\n\n24.\n\nOn 14 August 2020, the Parties submitted their respective responses to the Committee's directions of 10 August 2020.\n\n25.\n\nOn 28 August 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO1**\") recording the agreements of the Parties on procedural matters and the Committee's decisions on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of the proceeding would be decided before each session by the Committee after consultation with the Parties. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out a procedural calendar for the proceeding including the date for the Hearing for the Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n\n26.\n\nOn 2 November 2020, the Committee invited the Parties to consider the weeks of 18 and 25 October, 22 November and 6 December 2021, to hold the Hearing on Annulment. The Parties subsequently provided their availability.\n\n27.\n\nOn 16 November 2020, the Committee confirmed that the Hearing on Annulment would take place on the week of 25 October 2021.\n\n28.\n\nOn 26 November 2020, in accordance with the Procedural Calendar set out in PO1, De Jes\u00fas and Curtis both submitted their respective Memorial on Annulment. De Jes\u00fas' submission was accompanied by Exhibits A/R-1 to A/R-167 and Legal Authorities A/RLA-1 to A/RLA-76. Curtis' submission was accompanied by Exhibits A/R-1 to A/R-282 and Legal Authorities A/RLA-1 to A/RLA-176.\n\n29.\n\nIn accordance with the Procedural Calendar set out in PO1, the Conoco Parties filed their Counter-Memorial on Annulment together with Annex A, Exhibits A/C-1 to A/C-140 and Legal Authorities A/CLA-1 to A/CLA-102 on 24 February 2021.\n\n30.\n\nAs per the Procedural Calendar set out in PO1, De Jes\u00fas and Curtis both submitted their respective Reply on Annulment on 10 May 2021. De Jes\u00fas' submission was accompanied by Exhibits A/R-168 to A/R-184 and Legal Authorities A/RLA-77 to A/RLA-94. Curtis' submission was accompanied by Exhibits A/R-283 to A/R-293 and Legal Authorities A/RLA-177 to A/RLA-212.\n\n31.\n\nOn 23 July 2021, in accordance with the Procedural Calendar set out in PO1, the Conoco Parties filed their Rejoinder on Annulment together with Exhibit A/C-141 and Legal Authorities A/CLA-103 to A/CLA-115.\n\n32.\n\nOn 3 August 2021, the Secretary of the Committee wrote to the Parties on behalf of the Committee proposing to hold the hearing via Zoom due to the travel restrictions imposed by the COVID pandemic and invited the Parties to confer and agree on a schedule for the hearing.\n\n33.\n\nOn 11 August 2021, the Conoco Parties and Curtis submitted their proposals on the hearing schedule, and on 12 August 2021, De Jes\u00fas submitted its proposal.\n\n34.\n\nGiven the Parties' differing views on distinct matters, on 17 August 2021, the Committee transmitted its decision on the Parties on the mode of the hearing as well as the time allowance.\n\n35.\n\nOn 27 August 2021, the Committee circulated a draft of Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the organization of the Hearing on Annulment.\n\n36.\n\nOn 13 September 2021, De Jes\u00fas filed its proposed revisions and comments to the Committee's draft Procedural Order No. 2; Conoco and Curtis jointly filed their proposed revisions and comments.\n\n37.\n\nOn 17 September 2021, the Committee informed the Parties that Procedural Order No. 2 would be issued shortly, and a Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting was not necessary in view of the narrow scope of disagreements.\n\n38.\n\nOn 29 September 2021, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 (\"**PO2**\") concerning the arrangements for the Hearing on Annulment scheduled for 25-29 October 2021, and incorporating the agreements reached by the parties, as well as decisions made by the Committee in case of disagreements.\n\n39.\n\nOn 7 October 2021, ICSID wrote to the Parties informing them that the Secretary-General, moved the Committee to stay the proceeding pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and (e).\n\n40.\n\nOn 14 October 2021, the Committee stayed the proceeding for lack of payment of the required advances, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations 14(3)(d) and (e).\n\n41.\n\nFollowing the Respondent's payment of the outstanding advance, on 14 March 2022, the suspension of the proceeding was lifted, and the proceeding resumed.\n\n42.\n\nOn the same date, a disclosure from Mr. Kim was transmitted to the Parties.\n\n43.\n\nOn 18 March 2022, Mr. Kim notified his co-members and the Secretary-General that he was resigning as a Committee Member. On the same date, the Secretary-General notified the Parties of Committee's vacancy and suspended the proceeding pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 10(2) and 53.\n\n44.\n\nOn 20 March 2022, De Jes\u00fas requested that the Chairman of the Administrative Council seek a recommendation from the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration to fill the vacancy left by Mr. Kim.\n\n45.\n\nOn 28 March 2022, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the letter and informed the Parties that the Chairman would not seek an external recommendation to fill the vacancy in the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n46.\n\nOn 29 March 2022, De Jes\u00fas renewed its request and on 30 March 2022, the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the request.\n\n47.\n\nOn 7 April 2022, the Secretariat informed the Parties of the Secretary-General's intention to propose to the Chairman the appointment to the *ad hoc* Committee of Mr. Lawrence Boo, a national of Singapore.\n\n48.\n\nOn 29 April 2022, Conoco informed that it had no objections. De Jes\u00fas requested that the remaining Committee Members, Judge Hascher and Prof. Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, resign.\n\n49.\n\nOn 4 May 2022, Conoco submitted comments to De Jes\u00fas's request.\n\n50.\n\nOn 11 May 2022, the Secretariat transmitted to the Parties Judge Hascher's and Prof. Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo's message that they would continue to serve on the Committee.\n\n51.\n\nOn 24 May 2022, the Secretariat reiterated the Secretary-General's intention to propose Mr. Boo as per the communication of 7 April 2022.\n\n52.\n\nOn 26 May 2022, the Secretariat informed the Parties that the Chairman had appointed Mr. Boo and would seek his acceptance.\n\n53.\n\nOn 1 June 2022, the Committee was reconstituted. The new Committee was composed of Judge Dominique Hascher (French), Professor Diego Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo (Argentine/Spanish) and Professor Lawrence Boo (Singaporean). Following the reconstitution of the Committee, the proceeding resumed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 12 and 53.\n\n54.\n\nOn 12 June 2022, De Jes\u00fas submitted a Proposal for the Disqualification of Judge Dominique Hascher and Professor Diego Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo. The Proposal requested that the Secretary-General of ICSID seek a recommendation from a third-party neutral in connection with the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n55.\n\nOn 17 June 2022, ICSID acknowledged receipt of the Proposal and notified the Parties that in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision has been taken on the Disqualification Proposal. ICSID also informed the Parties that Ms. C. E. Salinas Quero, ICSID Legal Counsel, would now serve as Secretary of the Committee and established a procedural calendar for the subsequent filings on the Proposal.\n\n56.\n\nOn 22 July 2022, ICSID informed the Parties that the Chairman, after due consideration, and in the exercise of his discretion, decided to request a recommendation on the Disqualification Proposal from Mr. Ian Binnie C.C., Q.C., former Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\n57.\n\nOn 7 September 2022, following the Parties' comments on ICSID's communication of 22 July 2022, ICSID confirmed Judge Binnie's designation.\n\n58.\n\nOn 27 September 2022, ICSID transmitted to the Parties the Chairman of the Administrative Council's Decision, including a copy of Judge Binnie's recommendation to the Chair in respect of the Disqualification Proposal, dated 16 September 2022. The Proposal was declined, and the proceedings resumed on the same day.\n\n59.\n\nOn 5 October 2022, the Parties were invited to confer and propose dates to reschedule the Hearing on Annulment and their views on a paper hearing.\n\n60.\n\nFollowing receipt of the Parties' views on the Committee's message of 5 October 2022, the Committee decided to hold an oral, in-person hearing considering the fact that the sanitary restrictions which prompted videoconferencing in 2021 were lifted.\n\n61.\n\nOn 6 December 2022, the Parties were informed that a 3-day hearing would be held on the dates proposed, subject to the Parties' availability. The Committee also set out the Hearing sequence and time allocation for the Hearing.\n\n62.\n\nOn 21 December 2022, the Committee confirmed that the dates reserved for the 3-day Hearing were 18, 19, 20 and (21 in reserve) October 2023.\n\n63.\n\nOn 27 January 2023, ICSID informed the Parties of the 3 available venues to hold the 3-day Hearing in October 2023. On 14 February 2023, following the Parties' views on the venues, the Committee deemed Paris as an appropriate venue for the Hearing on Annulment.\n\n64.\n\nOn 24 August 2023, a draft Procedural Order No. 3 was circulated to the Parties requesting their joint comments or their respective positions in case of disagreement. The Parties were also requested to provide their availability to hold a Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting.\n\n65.\n\nOn 18 September 2023, De Jes\u00fas filed a request for the *ad hoc* Committee to decide on the admissibility of new evidence.\n\n66.\n\nOn 22 September 2023, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"**PO3**\") concerning the arrangements for the Hearing on Annulment.\n\n67.\n\nOn 29 September 2023, the Claimants filed a request for the *ad hoc* Committee to decide on the admissibility of new evidence and observations on De Jes\u00fas' request of 18 September 2023.\n\n68.\n\nOn 10 October 2023, the Committee admitted the Parties' document requests of 18 and 29 September 2023.\n\n69.\n\nA Hearing on Annulment was held in Paris from 18 October to 20 October 2023 (the \"**Hearing**\").

STAY OF ENFORCEMENT**\n----------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Parties' submissions on the Stay of Enforcement are summarized in the Committee's Decision of 2 November 2020.\n\n74.\n\nIn its Decision, the Committee decided:\n\n67. [\u2026] to discontinue the stay once it has been satisfied that all assurances have been given by the Conoco Parties that, should enforcement of the Award be possible under the OFAC sanctions regime, it can return any money collected under the Award to Venezuela in case of annulment. In fulfilment of this objective, the Committee requests that the Conoco Parties provide:\n\n1) the authorization from OFAC to pay any amounts recovered into a segregated account and to repay any funds paid on the Award if annulled, and\n\n2) the conditions for opening one or more segregated accounts for the funds collected outside of the US, and\n\n3) a guarantee from ConocoPhillips that it will return to Venezuela any funds paid under the Award.\n\n68. The Committee accepts that the authorizations from OFAC be submitted in redacted form.\n\n69. All questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Committee and of the Parties in connection with this application are reserved for subsequent determination, together with the Application for Annulment.\n\n75.\n\nBy letter dated 22 January 2021, the Claimants informed the Committee that the three conditions set forth in the Committee's Stay Decision, had been satisfied, and therefore the stay should be lifted. The letter was accompanied by Annex 1, a copy of the OFAC Authorization and Annex 2, a guarantee from ConocoPhillips.\n\n76.\n\nOn 5 February 2021, De Jes\u00fas submitted its observations and requested the Committee allow it to verify the evidence produced by the Claimants. The letter was accompanied by Annex 1, OFAC License No. VENEZUELA-EO13884-2020-370509-1 dated 15 January 2021, and Annex 2, ConocoPhillips Company's Letter, Guarantee of Repayment in Satisfaction of the Committee's Conditions on Lifting the Stay of Enforcement dated 21 January 2021.\n\n77.\n\nOn 8 February 2021, the Committee acknowledged receipt of the submissions and confirmed that it did not receive anything from Venezuela, as represented by Curtis.\n\n78.\n\nOn 10 February 2021, the Committee wrote to the Parties informing them, among other things, that it \"expect[ed] an OFAC authorization delivered to the Conoco Parties, identified in paragraph 3 of the Decision as ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V., the Respondents on Annulment that had opposed on 4 February 2020 Venezuela's request to continue the stay of enforcement.\"\n\n79.\n\nOn 12 February 2021, Conoco submitted a response to the Committee's communication of 10 February 2021, together with Annexes 1-5.\n\n80.\n\nThe Committee invited Venezuela to file any comments by 26 February 2021.\n\n81.\n\nOn 26 February 2021, De Jes\u00fas filed its comments asking the Committee to dismiss Conoco's request to lift the stay as in their view, they failed to comply with the three conditions set forth in the Committee's Stay Decision.\n\n82.\n\nOn 3 March 2021, the Committee wrote to the Parties in response to the recent correspondence. The Committee requested among other things, \"an official statement from OFAC that the Conoco Parties do not need the authorization requested under n\u00b0 67, 1) of the Stay Order\"; and for the Conoco Parties to \"produce a certificate referring to the commitments signed by Ms Schwarz on 21 January and 12 February 2021 (Annexes 2 and 4) and affirming her power and authority to act on behalf of the ConocoPhillips Company for the matter\".\n\n83.\n\nOn 11 May 2021, Conoco sent a letter to the Committee along with Annexes 1, 6, 7 and 8.\n\n84.\n\nOn 13 May 2021, the Committee invited Venezuela to comment by 21 May 2021.\n\n85.\n\nAs instructed by the Committee, De Jes\u00fas submitted its comments to the Claimants' letter and Annexes on 21 May 2021.\n\n86.\n\nFollowing receipt of Conoco's and De Jes\u00fas' correspondence, the Committee wrote to the Parties on 26 May 2021, and invited Conoco to provide concrete details of the segregated account(s).\n\n87.\n\nOn 17 June 2021, Conoco submitted an update together with Annexes 1, 3, and 9-11. The following day, the Committee invited Venezuela to comment by 23 June 2021. On 21 June 2021, De Jes\u00fas requested an extension, which the Committee granted.\n\n88.\n\nOn 30 June 2021, De Jes\u00fas filed its comments to Conoco's letter of 17 June 2021.\n\n89.\n\nOn 9 July 2021, the Committee wrote to the Parties whereby it asked Conoco to respond by 16 July 2021, to three questions posed by the Committee.\n\n90.\n\nIn accordance with the Committee's instructions, Conoco submitted its response on 16 July 2021, together with Annexes 9, 12 and 13.\n\n91.\n\nOn 20 July 2021, the Committee invited Venezuela to submit comments by 23 July 2021, which it did.\n\n92.\n\nOn 26 July 2021, the Committee wrote to the Parties, confirming that the first and third conditions set forth in their Stay Decision had been satisfied and asked Conoco to provide concrete details as to the second condition.\n\n93.\n\nOn 30 July 2021, Conoco provided an update as requested by the Committee. On 3 August 2021, De Jes\u00fas responded by stating that Conoco still had not satisfied the second condition.\n\n94.\n\nOn 5 August 2021, the Committee wrote to the Parties taking note of the recent correspondence and reserving its position until Conoco provided the final account information as stated in their letter.\n\n95.\n\nOn 8 September 2021, Conoco provided the final account information of the segregated accounts. On 9 September 2021, the Committee invited Venezuela to comment by 15 September 2021.\n\n96.\n\nOn 13 September 2011, De Jes\u00fas requested an extension until 17 September 2021, to file its comments and the Committee agreed. On 17 September 2021, De Jes\u00fas filed its response to Conoco's letter of 8 September 2021.\n\n97.\n\nOn 29 September 2021, the Committee wrote to the Parties informing them that the second condition of the Decision on Stay had been satisfied and, therefore, the stay of enforcement of the Award rendered on 8 March 2019, was discontinued.\n\n**IV. ORDERS ON REPRESENTATION**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\n98.\n\nOn 15 March 2020, De Jes\u00fas sent a letter asking the Committee to \"exclude the participation\" of Curtis from this proceeding on the basis that it is acting on a power of attorney issued by \"a person who does not exercise any authority or power within the Venezuelan legal system.\"\n\n99.\n\nOn 19 March 2020, the Committee invited Curtis and the Claimants to comment on De Jes\u00fas' 15 March letter regarding Venezuela's representation in this proceeding.\n\n100.\n\nOn 30 March 2020, Curtis filed their observations and requested the Committee to reject the application to change the *status quo* of Venezuela's representation. On the same date, Claimants submitted their respective comments stating that the *status quo* should be maintained with the participation of both the Special Attorney General and the Acting Attorney General and their respective representatives, Curtis and De Jes\u00fas.\n\n101.\n\nDe Jes\u00fas submitted further observations on 31 March 2020.\n\n102.\n\nOn 3 April 2020, the Committee concluded \"that maintaining Curtis and De Jesus as counsel of record accords, at this stage of the proceedings, [complies] with procedural fairness\" (\u00b6 37)1 and issued an Order rejecting De Jes\u00fas' application and decided \"not to exclude Curtis, instructed by the Special Attorney General, from these proceedings.\"\n\nOrder on the Applicant's Representation, 3 April 2020, \u00b6 37.\n\n103.\n\nOn 9 April 2020, De Jes\u00fas submitted a Reconsideration Request asking that the Committee revisit its 3 April Order, arguing that \"it lacks a legal basis as it disregards Venezuelan law, the only applicable law to resolve the issue of representation of the Republic\" and \"ignores the relevant facts in its assessment for the resolution of the issue of representation of the Republic.\"\n\n104.\n\nOn 13 April 2020, the Claimants and Curtis submitted their respective comments on the Reconsideration request, and on 14 April 2020, De Jes\u00fas submitted their reply.\n\n105.\n\nBy communication of 15 April 2020, the Committee rejected De Jes\u00fas' 9 April Request observing that the application was based on arguments which were already made by De Jes\u00fas in its previous letters and had been considered by the Committee when it decided to reject De Jes\u00fas's first application.\n\n106.\n\nOn April 16, 2020, De Jes\u00fas proposed to disqualify the entire *ad hoc* Committee. The proceeding remained suspended until July 23, 2020, when the Chairman of the Administrative Council issued a decision declining the disqualification proposal.\n\n107.\n\nOn 3 August 2020, De Jes\u00fas filed another request for the Committee to reconsider its Order on Representation of 3 April 2020.\n\n108.\n\nFollowing invitation from the Committee, on 12 August 2020, Curtis and the Claimants filed their observations on De Jes\u00fas' request of 3 August 2020.\n\n109.\n\nDuring the Stay of Enforcement Hearing held on 30 September 2020, the Parties were given the opportunity to address De Jes\u00fas' 3 August 2020, request. De Jes\u00fas presented oral observations during the hearing.\n\n110.\n\nBy Order dated 2 November 2020, \"[f]ailing any demonstration that Venezuela's representation should be in the hands of De Jes\u00fas, to the exclusion of Curtis, for the preservation of Venezuela's rights to accede to justice\" (\u00b6 39),2 the Committee decided to reject De Jes\u00fas' request of 2 August 2020, for reconsideration of the Order on Representation of 3 April 2020.\n\nOrder on the Applicant's Request for Reconsideration, 2 November 2020, \u00b6 39.\n\n111.\n\nOn 21 September 2021, De Jes\u00fas filed a Request asking the Committee to reconsider its Order of 2 November 2020.\n\n112.\n\nUpon an invitation from the Committee, on 23 September 2021, Curtis submitted their comments on De Jes\u00fas' Request of 21 September 2021, and the Claimants submitted their comments on 27 September 2021.\n\n113.\n\nThe proceeding was suspended from 14 October 2021 to 14 March 2022, due to lack of payment and again from 18 March to 1 June 2022, following the resignation of Mr. Kim. It was suspended again from 12 June to September 27, 2022, following the proposal to disqualify Committee Members Judge Hascher and Professor Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo.\n\n114.\n\nOn 6 December 2022, the Committee invited the Parties to update their respective submissions on the issue of the representation. On 15 December 2022, Curtis replied on behalf of Venezuela that \"we see no changes in the situation and have no further comment[\u2026]\"\n\n115.\n\nOn 16 December 2022, the Claimants replied that they \"have no further observations, as there has been no relevant change of circumstances. If the relevant circumstances do change, however, the Claimants will respond to any renewed application made;\" and on 21 December 2022, De Jes\u00fas replied that \"the Republic fully reiterates the content of its previous submissions [\u2026] and confirms it has no further comment. The Republic's communication is made without prejudice to its objection on the continued participation of Curtis in these proceedings [\u2026]\".\n\n116.\n\nBy Order dated 15 February 2023, the Committee decided the following:\n\n30. [\u2026] we conclude that the 21 September 2021 Request to reconsider the Reconsideration Order on Representation of 2 November 2020 has not demonstrated that the preservation of Venezuela's effective exercise of the right to present its case has been prejudiced by Curtis' involvement (see Order of 2 November 2020, para. 39).\n\n31. We, therefore, maintain today our Decision of 3 April 2020.\n\n32. All questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Committee and of the Parties in connection with this application are reserved for subsequent determination, together with the Application for Annulment.\n\n117.\n\nOn 12 September 2023, De Jes\u00fas submitted a letter dated 11 September 2023, from the Attorney General of the Republic of Venezuela requesting that the Committee reconsider its decision issued by way of Order dated 15 February 2023, on the issue of representation by Curtis. De Jes\u00fas submitted that in the current political and geopolitical context there is no doubt that the only Government of Venezuela is led by President Maduro and that the Attorney General is Mr Pedroza.3\n\nLetters of 11 September and 7 October 2023 of Attorney General Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza.\n\n118.\n\nUpon invitation from the Committee, Curtis and the Claimants each filed their observations on De Jes\u00fas' request of 12 September 2023.\n\n119.\n\nOn 8 October 2023, De Jes\u00fas submitted a letter dated 7 October 2023, from the Attorney General of the Republic of Venezuela containing further observations on the issue of the representation by Curtis.\n\n120.\n\nUpon invitation from the Committee, on 11 October 2023, Curtis submitted a letter from Gustavo Marcano of the *Consejo de Administraci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n de Activos de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela* and the Claimants filed their observations on the letter of the Attorney General dated 7 October 2023.\n\n121.\n\nOn the same date, the Committee acknowledged receipt of the Parties' correspondence and informed them the Request for Reconsideration would be considered and answered with the Request for Annulment of the Award as filed by Curtis on 27 November 2019, and De Jes\u00fas as filed on 5 December 2019, the hearing for which was from 18 to 20 October 2023.\n\n**B. The Committee's Analysis and Decision on the issue of Venezuela's Representation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Committee takes note that the Venezuelan political situation has evolved and is thankful to De Jes\u00fas for the information in furtherance of the Committee's communication of 16 April 2020. However, as this proceeding is concerned, the situation has not changed in the essence. The Republic, as represented by Curtis, replied that there was no basis to change the Committee's decision. Its Reply stated that \"pursuant to the Law Reforming the Statute Governing the Transition to Democracy to Restore the Validity of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Council for the Administration and Protection of Assets is the entity appointed by the legitimate representatives of the National Assembly of Venezuela to protect the assets of [the Republic] and to exercise the judicial representation of [the Republic] abroad.\"4 De Jes\u00fas retorted that such a Council does not exist and that the communication addressed to the Committee by its coordinator simulates an official Act of the Republic, even using its official coat of arms.5 It would, therefore, be difficult for the Committee to follow De Jes\u00fas' position that the situation of rivalry that existed until the time the Committee was deciding the representation issue has now ceased to exist. The Committee has no mandate to determine the political question of which De Jes\u00fas or Curtis is the legitimate representative of Venezuela.\n\nLetters of 5 and 11 October 2023 of the Consejo de Administraci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n de Activos de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela.\n\nLetter of 7 October 2023 of Attorney General Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza.\n\n123.\n\nThe Committee turns to De Jes\u00fas' observations that failure to exclude Curtis would place the Republic \"*in a grave situation since it would leave it at the mercy of a group of persons who, without having any authority granted by the Republic, with no regulation on the powers allegedly granted to it and with no limit to said powers, can only act \u2013we assume\u2013 in their own interest.*\"6 The Committee is mindful of its role to ensure procedural fairness, as it mentioned in the Order of 3 April 2020.7 However, it is difficult to proceed along the route indicated by De Jes\u00fas and exclude Curtis's right to be heard, given De Jes\u00fas's lack of substantiation regarding the integrity of its own right of defence.\n\nLetter of 11 September 2023 of Attorney General Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, p. 4.\n\nOrder on the Applicant's Representation, 3 April 2020, \u00b6 37.\n\n124.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Republic, through both representations, has sought the annulment of the Award. The arguments made by De Jes\u00fas or Curtis are similar and at times even identical. As anticipated by the Committee in its Order of 3 April 2020, even in the case of divergencies between De Jes\u00fas and Curtis, the Committee has heard their respective arguments. In short, Venezuela has had an opportunity, through both representations, to present extensively on its application for annulment; De Jes\u00fas and Curtis have made their own submissions and appeared separately at the Hearing on Annulment. As for Conoco, it agreed to bear the heavier burden of responding to the arguments made by Venezuela through the representations of De Jes\u00fas and Curtis.\n\n125.\n\nThe Committee consequently denies reconsidering its previous decisions and, thereby, maintains De Jes\u00fas and Curtis as counsel of record and will answer separately in this Decision the submissions made by De Jes\u00fas and Curtis as envisaged in the Order of 3 April 2020.8\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOrder on the Applicant's Representation, 3 April 2020, \u00b6 36.\n\n**V. SUMMARY OF THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nVenezuela, as represented by De Jes\u00fas and Curtis, requests that the *ad hoc* Committee annul the Award based on the improper constitution of the Tribunal (Article 52(1)(a)); serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b)); and failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n127.\n\nVenezuela invokes several annulment grounds in relation to its annulment request, which include: the composition of the Tribunal **(A);** the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction **(B)**; the Tribunal's findings in relation to Article 6 of the Treaty **(C)**; the Tribunal's application of the compensation mechanism **(D);** the Tribunal's treatment of certain quantum inputs and the valuation date for compensation (**E**); and the Award on Costs (**F**).\n\n128.\n\n**Section VI**, Part 1 and Part 2, respectively, contain a summary of the Parties' positions and the Committee's analysis of the annulment standards. **Section VII** summarizes the Parties' arguments and contains the Committee's analysis on the grounds invoked.\n\n129.\n\nThe summaries of the Parties' positions present the arguments separately advanced by Curtis and by the De Jes\u00fas representations, on one side, and by the Conoco Parties on the other side. In making its findings, the Committee has carefully considered the Parties' positions. References in this Decision to parts of the Parties' written and oral pleadings are not intended to be exhaustive. This summary is meant to give a general overview of this dispute. It does not claim to include all facts, laws, and arguments referenced by the Parties. These will be discussed, as far as considered relevant, in the context of the Committee's analysis of the disputed issues.\n\n130.\n\nIn its analysis, the Committee deals in separate sections with the arguments respectively advanced by Curtis and De Jes\u00fas, following the order in which their Applications for Annulment were filed,9 with each section referring to arguments and responses advanced by the Conoco Parties, to avoid repetition.\n\nSee Procedural History, \u00b6 6 above.\n\n**VI. THE STANDARDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**Part 1: The Parties' Positions on the standards under Convention article 52**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Standard for Annulment under Art. 52(1)(A): Improper Constitution of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Venezuela's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n131.\n\nVenezuela (De Jes\u00fas and Curtis) argues that the Committee's review under Article 52(1)(a) requires assessing the entirety of the relevant facts pertaining to the constitution of the Tribunal, including compliance with Convention Article 14(1)'s requirement that arbitrators \"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\"10 The standard of Article 14(1) includes the concepts of impartiality and independence.11 An arbitrator's failure to possess the qualities of Article 14(1) warrants annulling an award on grounds of improper constitution under Article 52(1)(a).12\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 17; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 25; Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6 89.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 18; Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6 89.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 21; Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 89, 90.\n\n132.\n\nTo support its position, Venezuela refers to the *ad hoc* committee in *Eiser v.

Argentina*, *Tidewater v. Venezuela*, and writings by authors.17\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 16, 22, 28.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 104.\n\n134.\n\nVenezuela (Curtis) also argues that the *ad hoc* Committee is not bound by the outcome of Venezuela's failed disqualification proposals during the arbitration.18Further, the standards to disqualify arbitrators are directly applicable to determine if a tribunal was improperly constituted under Art. 52(1)(a).19\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 92.\n\n135.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela (Curtis) argues that Conoco set a high bar for annulment under Article 52(1)(a). The decisions on challenges are entitled to a certain deference but the deference is not absolute. If a decision to deny disqualification is \"plainly unreasonable,\" then annulment is appropriate.20 In the underlying arbitration, the decision not to disqualify the challenged arbitrator was made by applying a wrong standard individually assessing each challenge in isolation from the prior facts.21\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 50.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 51.\n\n136.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas),reiterates its position that the Committee is not bound by prior decisions on disqualification but is empowered to assess the relevant facts and circumstances to verify whether the tribunal was properly constituted. The assessment of independence and impartiality under Convention Articles 14 and 57 requires an objective test that does not require proof of actual dependence or bias.22\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 22-29, 33.\n\n137.\n\nIn addition, the power to assess independence and impartiality is not, despite Conoco's assertion to the contrary, limited to a mere formal validation of disqualification decisions (*Azurix*). Such limitation would be contrary to the Committee's inherent mission to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings, which has been highlighted in *Eiser*.23 Also, the Conoco Parties rely, in the alternative, on the \"deferential approach\" (*EDF*),but confuse it with a submissive approach where committees are bound by the prior decisions on disqualification made in the arbitration. The present Committee is free to assess and it is not bound by prior disqualification decisions, as reaffirmed by the *Mobil* decision.24 In any event, even to apply the \"plainly unreasonable\" standard of the *EDF* decision, the Committee would have to consider factual elements to determine if a tribunal lacked independence and impartiality, including the factual and legal findings of the disqualification decisions made by the unchallenged arbitrators and the Chair.25\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 31, 32.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 35-40.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 41-44.\n\n**(b) The Conoco Parties' Position**\n------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nAnnulment on this ground cannot succeed unless there was a failure to comply with the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules relating to the constitution of the Tribunal.26 In no event is Venezuela entitled to reargue its failed disqualification proposals.27\n\nConvention Articles 37 through 40 (\"Constitution of the Tribunal\"), Articles 56 through 58 (\"Replacement and Disqualification of Conciliators and Arbitrators\"), and Arbitration Rules 1 through 12 (\"Establishment of the Tribunal\").\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 84.\n\n139.\n\nConoco submits that two approaches have emerged in analysing an alleged improper constitution under Art. 52(1)(a). Both approaches preclude a *de novo* review of allegations underlying the proposals for disqualification, requiring committees to approach the issue of an arbitrator's independence and impartiality with deference to the tribunal's factual and legal findings.28\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 85 and 87.\n\n140.\n\nAccording to the first approach, the inquiry of improper constitution is purely procedural. If the procedures for the tribunal constitution were followed, that is the end of the matter. The *ad hoc* committees in *Azurix v. Argentina* and *OI European v. Venezuela* adopted this approach.29According to the second approach, an annulment under Art. 52(1)(a) fails \"unless the decision not to disqualify the arbitrator in question is so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.\"30 The *ad hoc* committees *EDF v. Argentina, Suez II,* and *Mobil v. Argentina* adopted this approach.31 The scope of the Committee's review is limited to the question of whether the rejection of the challenge is so facially unreasonable that no rational decision-maker could have reached the same result.32\n\n**A/CLA-58**, *Azurix Corp. v.

The two lines of authorities discussed *supra* (*Azurix*/ *OI European* and *EDF/Suez II/Mobil Exploration*) preclude a *de novo* review.33 Under the *EDF* standard, the Committee must proceed with deference, limited to the facts found in the original decisions on disqualification and only review if the decisions were \"plainly unreasonable.\"34\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 25.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 28.\n\n142.\n\nConoco submits, contrary to Venezuela's (Curtis) position, that the adjudicators did not apply the wrong standard. Venezuela advocates for a \"cumulative circumstances\" rule which does not exist in the ICSID Convention or any annulment decision, and which Venezuela argued many times in the arbitration and lost every time.35 Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) similarly argues that the disqualification proposals were decided under an incorrect standard. Venezuela requests the Committee to assess the facts and circumstances giving rise to the proposals for disqualification. Such a request amounts to an impermissible *de novo* review and is nowhere to be found in the ICSID Convention or decided cases.36\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 34-38, 61.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 28(b).\n\n**B. The Standard for Annulment under Art. 52(1)(B): Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Venezuela's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n143.\n\nVenezuela (De Jes\u00fas) submits that two conditions must be met for an award to be annulled under Article 52(1)(b): first, the tribunal must have exceeded its powers; second, the excess must be manifest.37This Committee should, like other *ad hoc* committees have done in the past, adopt a 2-step approach to firstly, determine if the Tribunal exceeded its powers, and secondly, determine if the excess was manifest.38\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 136; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 48.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 137; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 48.\n\n144.\n\nVenezuela submits that a tribunal exceeds its powers when it goes beyond the scope of the parties' consent given by the arbitration agreement or parties' submissions, or when it fails to apply the applicable law.39 Further, Venezuela (Curtis) argues that a manifest excess of powers exists when a tribunal invents a dispute or create its own facts out of the undisputed material facts agreed between the parties.40\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 138; Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6 290, 291.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 294, 696.\n\n145.\n\nRegarding excess of power as going beyond party agreement, Venezuela relies on the decision of the *Helnan ad hoc* committee, to argue that, in the case of an investment treaty claim the parties' agreement is constituted by the BIT, the ICSID Convention and the claims brought against the State.41 In the present case, the Committee must first frame the scope of the Tribunal's powers and to that end it \"must primarily consider the terms of the ICSID Convention and those of the BIT.\"42Venezuela argues this exercise requires the Committee to independently interpret the jurisdictional sources and to carefully analyze the relevant case and doctrine of other tribunals and *ad hoc* committees.43\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 138 and Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6 290, citing **A/RLA-98 [Curtis]** / **A/RLA-59 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Helnan International Hotels A/S v.

Venezuela relies on the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Kl\u00f6ckner* which annulled the award under its scrutiny. According to the *Kl\u00f6ckner* committee, a tribunal fails to apply the law if it limits itself \"to postulating and not demonstrating the existence of a principle or exploring the rules by which it can only take concrete form.\"44Venezuela also submits that there is manifest excess of powers in cases of gross or egregious misinterpretation or misapplication of the law, which is tantamount to failing to apply the proper law.45\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 141 and Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6 292, citing **A/RLA-15 [Curtis]** / **A/RLA-39 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v.

In the latter case, if the tribunal nevertheless assumes jurisdiction, it necessarily exceeds its powers.46\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 142.\n\n148.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela (Curtis), suggests that the annulment decisions in *Occidental v. Ecuador* and in *Mobil v. Venezuela* are instructive on the issue of manifest excess of power and they put to rest Conoco's premise that manifest excess cannot coexist with extensive argumentation and analysis.47\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 60-62.\n\n149.\n\nVenezuela also replies that the Conoco Parties fail to deal with the cases demonstrating that failure to apply the applicable law constitute a ground for annulment. They ignored the *Mobil* decision and failed to deal with *Soufraki*, according to which egregious misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law may amount to failure to apply the proper law. Venezuela also refers to several authors and submits that a tribunal manifestly exceeds its authority if it disregards the agreement of the parties or goes beyond their submissions.48\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b667-71.\n\n150.\n\nFinally, Venezuela rebuts that the Tribunal disregarded the Parties' agreements and awarded compensation where it was not requested. Such excursions constitute an excess of authority, beyond any discretion they may be afforded to deal with quantum matters.49\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 72-76.\n\n151.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas), reiterates that the Committee shall perform a two-step analysis, which requires starting by framing the limits of the Tribunal's powers under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Venezuela submits that the Conoco Parties have not presented other appropriate methodology, other than objecting to the Committee reviewing the sources of the Tribunal's jurisdiction and applicable law.50\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6\n\n152.\n\nVenezuela also replies that Conoco Parties' defense created confusion between the first and second steps of the analysis. Venezuela submits that a tribunal exceeds its powers if it makes a decision non-compliant with the scope of its jurisdiction or if it fails to apply the applicable law. Venezuela relies on *Soufraki* to argue that egregious misapplication of the proper law or partial application of the law constitute excess of power.51\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 56-61, citing at para. 61, **A/RLA-8 [Curtis] / A/RLA-32 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v.

Several authorities acknowledge that \"manifest\" does not relate to the seriousness of the excess. Furthermore, Venezuela argues under Article 52(1)(b), excesses such as failure to apply the applicable law are naturally adverse to the party seeking an annulment.54\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 74.\n\n**(b) The Conoco Parties' Position**\n------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nConoco's position is that the ground of Article 52(1)(b) does not empower *ad hoc* committees to supplant a tribunal's findings of fact or law. The ground of \"manifest excess of powers\" prevents the tribunal from \"'stepp[ing] entirely outside the scope of its authority' as vested in it by the consent of the parties.\"55\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 92, citing *Soufraki Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 37.\n\n156.\n\nConoco agrees that under Article 52(1)(b), the Committee should make a two-step inquiry: first determine if the Tribunal exceeded its power; and second, if so, determine if the excess was \"manifest.\"56 This inquiry does not encompass an assessment of the evidence adduced before the tribunal and its probative value. Conoco argues that a tribunal's factual findings \"are essentially unassailable on annulment.\"57\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 94; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 14.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 99.\n\n157.\n\nConoco refers to the *ad hoc* committee in *Impregilo* to support its position that \"manifest\" means that the excess of power must be \"obvious, self-evident, clear, flagrant and substantially serious.\" This is a high threshold which is reached if the excess of powers is discernible or obvious from a simple reading of the award, without requiring an elaborate analysis of the award.58 In this regard, Conoco refers, among others, to the decisions of the *ad hoc* committees in *Standard Chartered Bank v. Tanzania59* and in *Repsol YPF v.

For Conoco, \"[\u2026] an alleged error cannot constitute a 'manifest' excess of power if the underlying issue is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation or is otherwise open to debate.\"61\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 97, referring to **A/RLA-61 [Curtis]**, *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1, Limited v.

This requirement, Conoco argues, follows from the exceptional nature of annulment as a post-award remedy.62\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 98.\n\n160.\n\nConoco's position is that an erroneous interpretation or application of the law is not a manifest excess of powers. Also, failure to apply the applicable law is not an excess of powers, unless a tribunal fails to apply the \"proper law *in toto*.\"63 A tribunal's decision not to address or apply a particular legal provision that it considers irrelevant does not constitute a failure to apply the applicable law.64 Conoco submits that Venezuela insists on alleged errors in the Tribunal's application of the BIT provisions or customary international law, in an attempt to relitigate issues decided by the Tribunal.65\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 104, referring to **A/RLA-64** [De Jes\u00fas], *AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft. v.

Besides, the term \"manifest\" demands that the excess be obvious and discernible without the need for elaborate interpretation or analysis.67\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 15.\n\n163.\n\nFurther, Conoco submits that Venezuela omits a part of the standard adopted in *Soufraki,* namely that an egregious error of law can amount to a failure to apply the proper law if the error is so gross that no reasonable person could accept it. Venezuela has not met that standard.68 Finally, Conoco reiterates that tribunals have significant latitude in resolving legal questions, arriving at compensation amounts and pursuing the line of reasoning they find most convincing, without being limited to the specific arguments presented by the parties.69\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 18.\n\n**C.

Spain*, Venezuela submits that the denial of its right to appoint a replacement arbitrator or to have an impartial tribunal are \"serious\" departures, as they could have had a material effect on the arbitrators, their deliberations, and the outcome.77\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 78, 79.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 81, 82.\n\n168.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) asserts that the issue is not the need to satisfy any two-prong test but the scope and content concerning the fundamental rules of procedure.78 Venezuela rebuts Conoco's proposition that Venezuela's right to appoint an arbitrator or to present its case should be excluded and are not concerned with the integrity and fairness of the procedure.79 Venezuela also disputes Conoco's position that for the departure to be serious it must reach a substantially different result had the rule been observed. Venezuela instead posits, citing the annulment decisions in *Caratube, Orascom*, and *TECO* in support, that a departure is serious if compliance with the rule could have potentially affected the award, without requiring a showing of a different outcome.80\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 79.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 83.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 86-89, citing *Caratube Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 43; *Orascom Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 142; **A/RLA-65 [De Jes\u00fas] / A/RLA-115 [Curtis]** *TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v.

Annulment under Article 52(1)(d) excludes ordinary rules not concerned with the integrity or fairness of the arbitration.83 This ground is \"restricted to the principles of natural justice, including the principles that both parties must be heard and that there must be adequate opportunity for rebuttal\"84\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 111.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 111, 343, referring to **A/RLA-9 [Curtis] / A/RLA-33 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v.

A serious departure is not one which merely potentially impacts the outcome.85\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 114, 115.\n\n**D. The Standard for Annulment under Art. 52(1)(E): Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Venezuela's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n172.\n\nConvention Article 52(1)(e) must be read in conjunction with Convention Article 48(3), which requires that the award \"'deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal and [to] state the reasons' on which the award is based.\"86 At a minimum, Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) require that the reader can follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B \u2013 a standard the committee in *MINE v. Guinea* adopted.87 In its Reply, Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) notes that Conoco Parties rely on the test articulated in *MINE*.88 Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) argues that contradictory or frivolous reasons do not meet this minimum standard articulated in *MINE*.89 However, insufficient or inadequate reasons amount to a failure to state reasons,90 and as the committee in *Soufraki* considered, can spur an annulment.91\n\nMemorial (Curtis), 296; Memorial (De Jes\u00f9s), 292; Reply (De Jes\u00f9s), 94.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), 297, Memorial (De Jes\u00f9s), 196, respectively, citing and referring to **A/RLA-10 [Curtis] / A/RLA-34 [De Jesus],** *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, 22 December 1989, (\"*MINE Annulment Decision*\"), \u00b6 5.09.\n\nReply (De Jesus), \u00b6 109.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), 297, citing *MINE Annulment Decision,* 5.08-5.09; Memorial (De Jesus), 196.\n\nMemorial (De Jesus), \u00b6 357.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 297, citing *Soufraki Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 122-123.\n\n173.\n\nFurther, Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) oblige a tribunal to deal with the issues, arguments and evidence presented to it. For example, the committee in *MINE* annulled the damages section of the award due to the tribunal's failure to consider the parties' arguments. Similarly, the committee in *Occidental v. Ecuador* stressed the importance of addressing every question submitted to the tribunal, and the committee in *TECO v. Guatemala*, stresses that \"a tribunal is duty bound to the parties to at least address those pieces of evidence that the parties deem to be highly relevant to their case and, if it finds them to be of no assistance, to set out the reasons for this conclusion.\"92\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 300, 301, respectively, citing **A/RLA-114 [Curtis] / A/RLA-58 [De Jesus]**, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment of the Award, 2 November 2015, (\"*Occidental Annulment Decision*\"), \u00b6 64; and *TECO Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 131, 135-136, 138.\n\n174.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela (Curtis) again refers to the annulment decision in *Mobil*, which the Conoco Parties failed to address along with other authorities. The committee in *Mobil* found that portions of the ICC award dealing with the relevance of the compensation provisions were unsupported by analysis and based on contradictory reasoning, and decided that it constituted a failure to state reasons. Venezuela also acknowledges that not every piece of evidence must make its way into the tribunal's analysis, but merely reciting documents in the record does not equal to addressing them. Venezuela refers to the annulment decision in *TECO* to argue that a tribunal cannot ignore key documents and critical arguments advanced by a party.93\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 83-87.\n\n175.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela reiterates that the Committee is empowered to review if the Tribunal's reasons were contradictory, insufficient or inadequate so as to warrant annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(e).94 Venezuela argues that the Conoco Parties misrepresent Venezuela's pleadings, insinuating the Republic is criticizing the quality (correctness) or persuasiveness of the Tribunal's reasoning, whereas Venezuela's arguments are grounded on the Award's inadequate or insufficient and its contradictory reasons.95\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 95-99.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 101-107.\n\n176.\n\nVenezuela submits that the Committee should apply the *Kl\u00f6ckner* test, which states that two genuinely contradictory reasons cancel each other out. Venezuela rejects Conoco's proposition to apply a heightened threshold, namely, that reasons must, firstly, be genuinely contradictory, and secondly, the issue relating to those reasons is necessary for the Tribunal's decision. This heightened threshold, Venezuela argues, is not a settled one.96\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 110, 111.\n\n**(b) The Conoco Parties' Position**\n------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nConvention Article 48(3) requires the tribunal to provide a reasoned award. In limited circumstances, a violation of the duty to provide reasons leads to annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(e).\n\n178.\n\nThis annulment ground does not permit committees to review the quality or persuasiveness of the tribunal's reasoning. Failure to state reasons can arise when there is complete absence of reasons; when the reasoning is contradictory; or where the reasoning lacks coherence so that it cannot be followed from \"Point A\" to \"Point B.\"97\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 121; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 20.\n\n179.\n\nVenezuela attacks the award on alleged failure to provide reasons, or for unintelligible reasons, but in reality, it disagrees with the Tribunal's reasoning and with the outcome of the Award. Article 52(1)(e) does not permit scrutinising the quality of the reasons or substituting the tribunal's judgment with the committee's own judgment.98 *Ad hoc* committees have confirmed that there is no basis for annulment if it is possible to follow a tribunal's reasoning through to its conclusion- even if the award contains errors of fact or law. Conoco refers to the *Vivendi I* committee, which considered that the ground of \"Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state any reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. [\u2026] [p]rovided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e).\"99\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 122.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 122, citing **A/CLA-43**, *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, (\"*Vivendi I, Annulment Decision*\"), \u00b6 647.\n\n180.\n\nFurther, a tribunal is not required to address each argument raised under every claim, or any argument that is not relevant to its decision. Neither is the tribunal required to expressly address any particular piece of evidence.100 Failure to state reasons must relate to a point that is essential to the tribunal's decision. A tribunal's reasons may be implicit, if they are understandable. Neither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specifies the manner in which a tribunal must state its reasons.101\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 124, 125.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 125, 126.\n\n181.\n\nFinally, the threshold for finding contradictory reasons amounting to a failure to state reasons is high. Conoco refers to the decision of the *Daimler* committee, which considered that annulment based on contradictory reasons requires \"[f]irst, the reasons must be genuinely contradictory in that they cancel each other out so as to amount to no reasons at all. Second, the point with regard to which these reasons are given is necessary for the tribunal's decision.\"102 In this regard, there is a difference between genuine contradictions and a tribunal's weighing of conflicting considerations (*Vivendi I*).103\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 127, citing **A/RLA-58 [Curtis] / A/RLA-80 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015, (\"*Daimler Annulment Decision*\"), \u00b6 77.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 128, referring to *Vivendi I*, *Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 65 (\"[T]ribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an ad hoc committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal's reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.\").\n\n182.\n\nIn addition, the Daimler committee noted, \"in reviewing the apparent contradictions, the ad hoc committee should, to the extent possible and considering each case, prefer an interpretation which confirms an award's consistency as opposed to its alleged inner contradictions.\"104 In any event, in this case, there were no contradictions in the Tribunal's reasoning, so no interpretation is necessary.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 128, citing *Daimler Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 78.\n\n183.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco reiterates that the threshold for establishing a failure to state reasons is high, and committees are not permitted to review the persuasiveness or correctness of the tribunal's reasons. Conoco argues that Venezuela cites no authority to undermine this standard.105\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 20.\n\n184.\n\nConoco also replies to Venezuela's contention that a tribunal cannot ignore key documents and critical arguments. Yet what constitutes a \"key\" document, or a \"critical\" argument is a determination left to the tribunal, which committees cannot second guess on annulment. Also, *TECO*, on which Venezuela relies, is entirely different from this one. The *TECO* committee concluded that the tribunal had ignored 1,200 pages of evidence submitted by the parties' experts on an outcome-determinative issue, leaving the committee to guess the tribunal's reasoning, if any. Such a situation is not comparable to the Tribunal's approach in this case.106\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 21.\n\n**Part 2: The Committee's analysis of the applicable standards**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nIn this section on the standards of annulment, the Committee only wishes to discuss the areas of contention between the Parties and remind all of the generally accepted characteristics of the grounds of challenge raised by Venezuela. In Part 3 of this Decision, the Parties can find the Committee's analysis of the arguments made by the Parties for each ground of annulment invoked under Convention Article 52.\n\n**(a) Article 52(1)(a) \u2013 Improper Tribunal Constitution**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\n*Ad hoc* committees are called under Convention Article 52 to safeguard the integrity of the process of dispute settlement. This objective forms the basic goal projected in the ICSID annulment mechanism of Convention Article 52. Independence and impartiality, qualities that every ICSID arbitrator should possess according to Convention Article 14(1) and Arbitration Rule 6, are quintessential to the dispensing of justice, in arbitration, and are regarded as prerequisites for a valid award under Article 52(1)(a).\n\n187.\n\nThis Committee considers that the test for an Article 52(1)(a) inquiry made based on the alleged lack of independence and impartiality, commences with the question of whether the right to raise the matter was waived because the party seeking annulment failed to raise it sufficiently promptly. Then, if not, whether the party seeking annulment could establish that a third party would find a manifest appearance of lack of independence or impartiality on the part of an arbitrator on a reasonable evaluation of the facts of the case; and then, if so, whether the manifestly apparent lack of impartiality or independence on the part of that arbitrator could have had a material effect on the award.107\n\n*Eiser Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 180.\n\n188.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute regarding the scope of the Committees' authority under Article 52(1)(a) when disqualification proposals already have been rejected in the arbitration regarding the impugned arbitrator. Conoco proposes to adopt the standard endorsed by the *ad hoc* committees in *Azurix v. Argentina108* and *OI European v. Venezuela*109 which, having regard to the expression of Article 52(1)(a) \"*the Tribunal is not properly constituted*,\" limited the review of *ad hoc* committees to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, including the procedure for challenging arbitrators. In the present case, Conoco submits that Venezuela's challenge should fail as there is no argument concerning the procedure by which the five individual challenges to Mr Fortier and the two challenges to the Tribunal Majority were resolved.110\n\n*Azurix Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 279.\n\n*OI Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 108.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 87, 133.\n\n189.\n\nAs Venezuela pertinently points out,111 *ad hoc* committees would not be fulfilling their essential mission of ensuring the integrity of the arbitration proceedings and the legitimacy of the award if they shun from reviewing independence and impartiality which directly affect the legitimacy of awards. This was expressed with force by the *Eiser* committee:\n\n\"*Thus, in light of the text, context and object and purpose of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention, this Committee concludes that, for purposes of determining whether the Tribunal was properly constituted, it has the authority to examine whether the members of the Tribunal were and remained (and were seen to be/remain) impartial and independent throughout the proceedings. The role of an ad hoc committee is to ensure that the integrity of the proceedings and the legitimacy of the award was not undermined. The impartiality and independence of the arbitrators, being an essential requirement for a valid and legitimate award, can, therefore, be assessed in the context of annulment proceedings*.\"112\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 16.\n\n*Eiser Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 178.\n\n190.\n\nConoco concedes on the basis of the decisions of the *EDF v. Argentine*113 and *Suez v. Argentine*114 committees, that the substance of an arbitrator challenge may be subject to limited review when the decision not to disqualify the arbitrator is so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.115\n\n*EDF Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 145.\n\n*Suez Annulment Decision,* \u00b6 94.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 86.\n\n191.\n\nVenezuela116 reminds the decision of the *Mobil* committee clarifying the role of the remaining members of the tribunal or of the Chair of the Administrative Council under Articles 57 or 58 of the ICSID Convention and that of an ad hoc committee under Article 52(1)(a):\n\n\"*The Chairman of the Administrative Council assists the parties with difficulties regarding the constitution of the arbitration tribunal during the arbitration procedure. An ad hoc committee plays a very different role. Its mandate under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention is to verify the integrity of the award. Therefore, the impartiality of the arbitral tribunal, which is an essential requirement for the validity of the award, can be assessed in the light of the procedural decisions taken by it in the context of the annulment proceedings. In examining this ground for annulment, the ad hoc Committee does not act as an appellate body in relation to the decision taken by the Chairman of the Administrative Council on a request for disqualification under Article 58 of the ICSID Convention.*\"117\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 26.\n\n*Mobil Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 44.\n\n192.\n\nWhether or not an arbitrator should continue to sit is a matter for the remaining members of the tribunal or the Chair of the Administrative Council under Articles 57 or 58 of the ICSID Convention. When acting as a challenge authority, the other arbitrators or the Chair participate in the efficient and orderly administration of arbitration proceedings under the aegis of ICSID. The disqualification authority resolves difficulties in the constitution of the arbitral tribunal to permit the proceedings to move forward in furtherance of the parties' intention for an efficient arbitration process under the aegis of ICSID.\n\n193.\n\nThe ground for annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(a) is a remedy that concerns the award and not the decisions of tribunal members or of the President of the World Bank in his capacity as Chair of the ICSID Administrative Council made on disqualification proposals under Article 58 of the Convention. This distinction notwithstanding, the *Azurix* committee suggested that an *ad hoc* committee should examine the correctness of the procedure followed rather than of the correctness of the decision, doing so on the latter would be tantamount to an appeal against the tribunal's decision.118 The *EDF* committee substituted the compliance procedure followed by the body deciding on disqualification with the challenge procedure set out in the ICISD Convention, and adopted a narrow legal review of the reasonableness of the decision on disqualification. *EDF* falls in line with the same policy followed by *Azurix* which denies *ad hoc* committees the possibility to determine whether an arbitrator possesses the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality. The *EDF* committee viewed this function as being entrusted under Articles 57 and 58 of the Convention to the remaining members of the tribunal or the Chairman of the Administrative Council.119 *EDF* was decided prior to *Eiser* which changed the situation, as otherwise, if its ruling had to be followed when no challenge happened in the arbitration, the co-arbitrators should be retroactively asked to decide the challenge, notwithstanding that the award has already been made.\n\n*Azurix Annulment Decision*, (\u00b6 282): \"The Committee further is of the view that an ad hoc committee cannot decide for itself whether or not a decision under Article 58 was correct, as this would be tantamount to an appeal against such a decision\".\n\n*EDF Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 144.\n\n194.\n\nBased on the foregoing, Conoco claims that Article 52(1)(a) does not permit a *de novo* review of the disqualification proposals decided in the underlying arbitration.120 When examining the ground of Article 52(1)(a), an *ad hoc* committee does not review the decisions made by the Chair of the Administrative Council or of the other members of the arbitral tribunal on a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator. An *ad hoc* committee's duty under Article 52(1)(a) is to assess the independence and impartiality of the arbitral tribunal which conditions the integrity of the award and not the validity of the decisions of the disqualification authorities. As Venezuela notes,121 Article 52(1)(a) does not restrict a committee's powers but requires that, in satisfaction of its mission to safeguard the integrity of the award, a committee verifies whether the members of the arbitral tribunal exercised independent and impartial judgment.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 85.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 25.\n\n195.\n\nYet, Conoco remarks that the facts denounced by the Applicant in support of its attack against the independence and impartiality of Mr Fortier and Judge Keith are the same as those argued by Venezuela in front of the body deciding the disqualification proposals in its efforts to unseat these two arbitrators during the arbitration. Conoco described the Applicant's challenge against Mr Fortier as \"*a single challenge regurgitated four times*.\"122 Venezuela argues that the circumstances underlying its various disqualification proposals should be analysed collectively123 or assessed in the aggregate, rather than in isolation, as the unchallenged members did when they refused to consider the \"cumulative record\" of prior proposals.124 Conoco deplores that Venezuela would be given two bites at the apple and could raise several challenges which individually did not meet the standard for disqualification but on annulment argue that the accumulation of challenges warrants a reassessment by the Committee of the same challenge, as with an appeal, thus distorting the permitted degree of review on annulment, limited, per the *EDF* standard, to whether the challenge decisions in the arbitration were plainly unreasonable.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 139.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 38.\n\n**A/R-153 [Curtis] / A/R-174 [De Jes\u00fas]** Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L.

They have an administrative nature and carry no *res judicata* effect which would preclude an *ad hoc* committee from examining an Article 52(1)(a) challenge.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 35.\n\n197.\n\nThe objective of the Committee under Article 52 is entirely different from that of a body deciding on a disqualification proposal whose intervention occurs during the arbitration before the making of the award. After the award, the disqualification of an arbitrator becomes without purpose. All that remains to be checked is whether the award was made by independent and impartial arbitrators. The resolution of the isolated incidents by the various decisions on the disqualification proposals cleared the scene at the time they were made, they never purported to, and could not, assess the situation of the arbitrators in the contents of the award. The decisions denying the disqualification proposals may be taken into consideration for our purpose, but it remains a committee's role to evaluate the integrity of an arbitrator's situation and comportment during the entire proceedings from the moment the award has been made.126 Venezuela adds that the Committee could not determine the unreasonableness of the decisions on disqualification without undertaking a review of the relevant facts and circumstances of the disqualification proposals.127 As already noted, the test calls for a reasonable evaluation of the facts of the case for finding a manifest appearance of lack of independence and impartiality. Depending on the outcome of the Committee's decision under Article 52(1)(a), it can be inferred in retrospect whether the decisions on disqualification reached in the course of the arbitration proceedings could be regarded as plainly unreasonable (or the reverse).128\n\nEfficiency would not be served if a committee otherwise had to sift through the circumstances which were reasonably decided by the competent body during the arbitration for identifying the undecided issues left for its own review (see footnote No. 394 *infra*).\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 41, 44.\n\nThus, the *Mobil v. Argentine* committee assessed for itself the independence and impartiality of the members of the arbitral tribunal before concluding that the Chairman's decision was not unreasonable (*Mobil Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 46).\n\n198.\n\nIn making its analysis under Article 52(1)(a), the Committee observes that this is a case in which the Applicant filed in the underlying arbitration seven disqualification proposals (five directed to the same individual arbitrator and two included an additional arbitrator). Three out of the five arbitrators who sat on the Tribunal participated in decisions regarding its constitution which were later contested by Venezuela under Article 52(1)(a).129 An approach limited to the reasonableness of the decisions would be all the more inappropriate in the circumstances as the decision makers are themselves under attack. With this unique background, the Committee finds compelling reasons to assess if the Tribunal was and remained properly constituted until the rendition of the Award. The Committee is mindful that this approach is limited to the specific circumstances of this actual case and should not be read as an invitation for disputing parties in other cases to file multiple disqualification proposals to later seek annulment of the award for alleged improper constitution of the tribunal.\n\nMr Fortier, Professor Bucher and Judge Keith.\n\n199.\n\nThe Committee will examine in **Section VII A.3** whether an Award rendered by an Arbitral Tribunal composed of Mr Fortier, Judge Keith and Professor Bucher withstands the Applicant's criticisms.\n\n**(b) Article 52(1)(b) \u2013 Manifest Excess of Powers**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nArticle 52(1)(b) involves an excess of powers which must be manifest. The ground applies to issues of jurisdiction and merits alike, no distinction being made between these issues in Article 52. Some *ad hoc* committees have approached Article 52(1)(b) with a two-step analysis which requires, first to determine whether there had been an excess of powers, followed by assessing whether the excess of powers is also manifest. Others have considered a *prima facie* test under which a summary examination should be made to ascertain whether any alleged excess of powers is so egregious as to be manifest. Manifest may thus mean plain or evident, discernible without in-depth analysis. It may also refer to the strength or seriousness of the excess of powers.130 Whichever the approach, the reprehensible excess of powers should not give rise to discussion. Hence the consensus of *ad hoc* committees is that a plausible, debatable or otherwise tenable decision escapes annulment. It follows that there is general agreement that errors of law are not deficiencies for Article 52(1)(b) purposes.\n\n**A/RLA-42 [Curtis] / A/RLA-6 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID (\"*ICSID Annulment Paper*\").\n\n**(c) Article 52(1)(d) \u2013 Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nArticle 52(1)(d) involves a departure, which must be serious, from a rule of procedure, which must be of a fundamental nature. Rules of natural justice concern the fairness and adversarial nature of the proceedings, and not all arbitration rules, are protected under Article 52(1)(d). As an example, the independence and impartiality of the arbitral tribunal is one of the facets of natural justice and due process. The right to an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal is recognized in the decisions of *ad hoc* committees as participating in the fundamental exigencies of a fair trial whose integrity is protected under Article 52(1)(d).131\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 103-104; *Kl\u00f6ckner Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 95; *Wena Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 57; *Impregilo Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 165; *EDF Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 123; *Eiser Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 254. Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 169: \"*independence and impartiality of an arbitrator is a fundamental rule of procedure*.\"\n\n202.\n\nThe focus of an Article 52(1)(d) enquiry is not whether the arbitrators committed a fault in the arbitral process or could have done things differently, but whether the proceedings were conducted in a fair manner. A serious departure refers to meaningful breaches of the rules of natural justice which cause prejudice. The Applicant is not required to demonstrate that the award would have been different, absent the departure from the procedural rule. An immaterial breach which had no consequence will not justify an annulment of the Award.\n\n**(d) Article 52(1)(e) \u2013 Failure to State Reasons**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe statement of reasons which is required by Article 52(1)(e) is the parties' guarantee against arbitrariness. Parties are entitled to be told why they have won or lost. The persuasiveness or the quality of the reasons escape the enquiry under Article 52(1)(e). The arbitral tribunal should deal with all issues that have a conclusive nature, rather than each and every argument made by the parties. It is accepted practice under Article 52(1)(e) that insufficient, inadequate or contradictory reasons which cancel each other are regarded as an absence of reasons. An *ad hoc* committee is not required to assiduously comb the award for Article 52(1)(e) purposes. Rather, an award should be read generously. If the motivation can be discerned or inferred from the context, there is no failure to state reasons.\n\n**VII. THE GROUNDS INVOKED**\n----------------------------\n\n**A. GROUNDS RELATED TO THE TRIBUNAL COMPOSITION: IMPROPER CONSTITUTION AND SERIOUS DEPARTURE**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nVenezuela submits that the Tribunal was improperly constituted (**A.1**) because **(a)** arbitrators Fortier and Keith could not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment, and, that Venezuela's disqualification proposals should have been sustained; and **(b)** arbitrator Bucher was improperly appointed since Venezuela had the right to appoint a replacement arbitrator after arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation. Relying on the same facts, Venezuela also submits that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (**A.2**).\n\n205.\n\nRegarding (a), Conoco counters that Venezuela is asking the Committee to make a *de novo* review of each of the decisions made on the failed disqualification proposals that Venezuela filed against Arbitrator Fortier individually,132 and against Arbitrators Fortier and Keith as the Tribunal majority.133 Regarding (b), Conoco argues that Venezuela had no right to appoint a replacement arbitrator because the Tribunal did not consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation.134\n\nOn 5 October 2011 Venezuela proposed to disqualify arbitrator Fortier. On 27 February 2012, the Tribunal majority, composed of arbitrators Keith and Abi-Saab, dismissed the proposal.\n\nOn 11 March 2014 Venezuela proposed to disqualify arbitrators Fortier and arbitrator Keith. On 6 February 2015 Venezuela again proposed to disqualify arbitrator Fortier and on 25 March 2015 Venezuela extended its proposal to also seek the disqualification of arbitrator Keith.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 5.\n\n***A.1. T****he** **P****arties****' P****ositions on the** **I****mproper** **C****onstitution***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nVenezuela invokes several arguments to support its contention that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier could not be relied upon to exercise impartial and independent judgment, that the appointment of Arbitrator Bucher was improper, and that the Committee should annul the Award for improper constitution.\n\n207.\n\nThe Committee will first summarize the arguments advanced by Venezuela as represented by Curtis (**A.1(1)**); then by Venezuela as represented by De Jes\u00fas (**A.1(2)**) and then by the Conoco Parties (**A.1(3)**) in relation to **(i)** the disqualification proposals of arbitrator Fortier; **(ii)** the disqualification proposals of Arbitrators Fortier and Keith; and **(iii)** the appointment of Arbitrator Bucher. The Committee's analysis on this ground is in **Section A. 1(4)**.\n\n**A.1(1) Improper Constitution as Argued by Venezuela (Curtis)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Arbitrator Fortier**\n-------------------------\n\n**(a)** Arbitrator Fortier's failure to disclose the merger between Norton Rose and Macleod Dixon\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nFor Venezuela, the accumulation of circumstances would have justified the disqualification of Arbitrator Fortier.135 On 4 October 2011, Arbitrator Fortier disclosed the plans of his (then) law firm, Norton Rose, OR LLP to merge with Canadian law firm Macleod Dixon LLP. Arbitrator Fortier disclosed that he had learned that the Caracas office of Macleod Dixon was providing services to Conoco, acting adverse to Venezuela's interests in certain matters, and acting on behalf of Conoco in certain ICC proceedings against Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA).136 On 5 October 2011, Venezuela proposed to disqualify Arbitrator Fortier as a result of his disclosure.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 108. Tr. Hr. Day 1, 141:12-14.\n\n**A/R-52 [Curtis] / A/R-93 [De Jes\u00fas]**, E-mail from Mr. Fortier to Meg Kinnear, Secretary-General of ICSID, dated 4 October 2011 (\"*Fortier email to ICSID SG*\").\n\n209.\n\nVenezuela asked Arbitrator Fortier to answer six questions, including the extent of Macleod Dixon's relationship with the Conoco Parties, the identity of the private oil companies represented by Macleod Dixon in connection with the migration of oil projects to *Empresas Mixtas* in 2007 and the nature of those assignments. Venezuela notes that Macleod Dixon continued to represent the Conoco Parties after the merger in an arbitration against PDVSA where the same Hamaca and Petrozuata Association Agreements were disputed. Freshfields was Macleod Dixon's co-counsel in that137 case.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.\n\n210.\n\nOn 18 October 2011, Arbitrator Fortier indicated he had not been involved in the negotiation leading to the merger and had no knowledge of the information sought in questions (i) to (v).138 He also announced his resignation from Norton Rose, effective on 31 December 2011, and he would \"thus cease to earn any remuneration from Norton Rose.\"139He also stated that there were members of Norton Rose who had assisted him in certain files in which he served as arbitrator, whom he may continue to call upon for assistance after 1 January 2012. He indicated that the only person who had assisted him in the case was Ms. Bendayan, a Norton Rose junior associate.140\n\n**A/R-53 [Curtis] / A/R-94 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Mr. Fortier's Letter of 18 October 2011, p. 2 (\"*Fortier October letter to co-arbs*\").\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 11; **A/R-53 [Curtis] / A/R-94 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Fortier October letter to co-arbs*, p. 1.\n\n**A/R-53 [Curtis] / A/R-94 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Fortier October letter to co-arbs*, p. 2.\n\n211.\n\nOn 27 February 2012, after the Parties had a chance to submit further observations on the proposal, Arbitrators Keith and Abi-Saab rejected the disqualification proposal.\n\n212.\n\nVenezuela submits that Arbitrator Fortier's obligation to disclose arose long before the merger. The merger involved long negotiations between his then firm and a firm that was acting (and continued to act) adverse to Venezuela and PDVSA and acted as Freshfields' co-counsel against PDVSA.141 Venezuela also maintains that Arbitrator's Fortier disclosure revealed an intention to remain at Norton Rose, and he resigned only after Venezuela filed to disqualify him and asked him questions.142\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 15.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 17.\n\n213.\n\nVenezuela submits that its first challenge was based on actual and objective facts that were undisputed, and instead of resigning as arbitrator, Mr. Fortier opted to resign from his (then) firm.143\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 18.\n\n**(b)** Arbitrator Fortier's continued ties with Norton Rose\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nVenezuela maintains that Arbitrator Fortier kept ties with Norton Rose, which he failed to disclose. In the arbitration *Yukos v. The Russian Federation* presided by him, Arbitrator Fortier was assisted by a Norton Rose partner, Mr. Valasek. The respondent in that case questioned Mr. Valasek's assistance as exceeding mere administrative work.144\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28\n\n215.\n\nOn 29 January 2015, Venezuela asked Arbitrator Fortier to disclose the extent of his relationship with Norton Rose. On 3 February 2015 Arbitrator Fortier replied that he had ceased any professional relationship with the firm, and had since January 2012 pursued a career as an independent arbitrator and was a door tenant at 20 Essex Street in London and a member of Arbitration Place in Toronto.145\n\n**A/R-131 [Curtis] / A/R-177 [De Jes\u00fas]**, E-mail of 3 February 2015, from Gonzalo Flores, (then) Secretary of the Tribunal to the Parties, forwarding Mr. Fortier's response of the same day.\n\n216.\n\nOn 6 February 2025, Venezuela proposed to disqualify Arbitrator Fortier.\n\n217.\n\nOn 16 April 2015, Arbitrator Fortier furnished explanations in connection with another proposal for disqualification filed on 25 March 2025 by Venezuela (concerning Arbitrators Keith and Fortier). In these explanations, arbitrator Fortier described Mr. Valasek's role and disclosed he was being assisted in another ICSID case by a Norton Rose lawyer, Ms. Fitzgerald. On 1 June 2015, upon Venezuela's insistence, he also disclosed that Ms. Bendayan, had assisted him in another ICSID case until the issuance of the decision on Jurisdiction in February 2013.146\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 42.\n\n218.\n\nVenezuela submits that Arbitrator Fortier from the beginning made incomplete, misleading, and inaccurate disclosures despite Venezuela's repeated requests and he did not fully sever ties with Norton Rose.147\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b644.\n\n219.\n\nOn 1 July 2015, the Chair of the Administrative Council rejected the proposal to disqualify Arbitrator Fortier.148 Venezuela argues that the Chair simply adopted Arbitrator Fortier's position. It also argues arbitrator Fortier's relationship with Norton Rose and assistance from Norton Rose lawyers was still ongoing as he admitted in his disclosure of 18 October 2011 that he may call certain members of the firm for administrative assistance.\n\nIn the meantime, on 20 February 2015, arbitrator Abi-Saab resigned. At the time of arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation, he and arbitrator Keith had not yet decided Venezuela's pending proposal to disqualify arbitrator Fortier.\n\n220.\n\nVenezuela's view is that the Chair failed to explain how the 2011 disclosure \"could constitute carte blanche for Mr. Fortier to continue his extensive substantive relationships with Norton Rose attorneys.\"149Venezuela also criticizes the Chair's observation that the allegations concerning Mr. Valasek were irrelevant because the Yukos case was unrelated to this one. For Venezuela, that observation missed the fact that Arbitrator Fortier \"had a continuing, substantive and extensive professional relationship with a partner of Norton Rose whose opinions and writings on international law issues of direct relevance to this case were adverse to Venezuela and even cited by the Conoco Parties in their pleadings.\"150\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 47.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 48.\n\n221.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela rebutting Conoco's *de novo* review argument asks the Committee to decide if under the cumulative circumstances giving rise to the earlier challenges, it was plainly unreasonable to allow Arbitrator Fortier to remain on the Tribunal.151 Venezuela argues that prior arbitrators deciding on the challenges missed the point, and it was not that prior challenges or facts should be reconsidered, but that all facts should be considered together as if there were only one challenge based on cumulative facts in the record.152\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 117.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 116.\n\n222.\n\nHere, the decisions rejecting the disqualifications of Arbitrator Fortier were plainly unreasonable, due to the repeated inaccurate, incomplete and/or misleading disclosures of Arbitrator Fortier. Also, this case is not merely about non-disclosure, but about affirmative disclosure which time after time was proven to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. Arbitrator Fortier was permitted to stay in the Tribunal due to the application of the wrong standard. The mentioned decisions judged each challenge individually in isolation from whatever facts came before and were the object of prior challenges.153\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 51-53\n\n223.\n\nVenezuela also submits that, despite Conoco's contention to the contrary, Venezuela did not raise challenges that were irresponsible or opportunistically timed. The challenges arose from arbitrator Fortier's inaccurate, incomplete, and misleading disclosures. Venezuela also argues that the situation in this case, with Macleod Dixon, and the Conoco Parties is even more serious than that in the *Loewen* arbitration, from which Arbitrator Fortier resigned. In that case, the United States challenged him following the proposed merger of his firm (which did not materialize) with another firm that previously acted for the claimants.154 Further, the challenges arose from Arbitrator Fortier's fortuitous disclosures of circumstances that should have been earlier disclosed by him. Venezuela raised the disqualification proposals promptly after learning of the relevant circumstances and was not aimed at causing any delay.155\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 90, 91.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 97.\n\n**ii. Arbitrators Keith and Fortier**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**(a)** Refusal to reconsider Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nOn 11 March 2014, Venezuela proposed to disqualify Arbitrators Keith and Fortier. Venezuela's proposal was prompted by their refusal to reconsider the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 September 2013, made by the Tribunal Majority Arbitrators Keith and Fortier, with Arbitrator Abi-Saab dissenting.156In their Decision, the Tribunal Majority found that Venezuela had failed to negotiate the compensation for the 2007 oil nationalization in good faith by reference to the BIT's standard of market value.157 Arbitrator Abi-Saab dissented on that point.158\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 19.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43** **[De Jes\u00fas]**, Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, 3 September 2013, (\"*Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*\"), \u00b6 394.\n\n**A/R-4 [Curtis] / A/R-45 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Georges Abi-Saab to the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 September 2023, 19 February 2015, (\"*Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion*\"), \u00b6 85.\n\n225.\n\nOn 8 September 2013, Venezuela requested that the Tribunal reconsider its Decision on the ground that the Decision was \"based largely on certain misapprehensions [\u2026] [was] unsustainable both as a matter of fact and as matter of law.\"159 For Venezuela the correction of any of the errors of the Decision would change the conclusion on the issue of bad faith negotiation.160\n\n**R-313**, Respondent's Letter to the Tribunal, 8 September 2013, p. 1.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 21.\n\n226.\n\nIn its request for reconsideration, Venezuela referenced, among other alleged errors, evidence introduced after the 2010 main hearing, namely, leaked U.S. Embassy cables reporting on the briefing made by the ConocoPhillips negotiators to the U.S. Embassy in Caracas. Venezuela submits that the U.S. Embassy cables proved that the Conoco Parties made false representations to the Tribunal regarding Venezuela's supposed unwillingness to negotiate compensation based on fair market value.161\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 21, referring to **A/R-42 [Curtis]**, Respondent's Memorial in Support of Proposal to Disqualify Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier, 21 March 2014, \u00b6 10.\n\n227.\n\nOn 10 March 2024, the Majority of the Tribunal, composed of Arbitrators Keith and Fortier, rejected Venezuela's request for reconsideration. Arbitrator Abi-Saab dissented, stating, among others, that \"I don't think that any self-respecting Tribunal [\u2026] can pass over such evidence, close its blinkers and proceed to build on its now severely contestable findings, ignoring the existence and the relevance of such glaring evidence.162\n\n**A/R-41 [Curtis] / A/R-82** **[De Jes\u00fas]**, Dissenting Opinion of Professor Georges Abi-Saab to the Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, 10 March 2014, (\"*Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion \u2013 Reconsideration Request*\"), \u00b6 66.\n\n228.\n\nVenezuela proposed to disqualify Arbitrators Keith and Fortier arguing that their refusal to reconsider the September 2013 Decision, regardless of the facts showed, created at least the appearance of bias in the mind of any reasonable third party.163Venezuela submits that the basis for its disqualification proposal related to the nature of the decision-making process and the resulting rulings (with arbitrators refusing to consider the indisputable documentary evidence and misrepresentations made by the other party) and was not merely disagreement on legal and factual issues.164\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 23.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 24.\n\n229.\n\nOn 5 May 2014, the Chairman of the Administrative Council rejected the proposal.165Venezuela submits that the Chair failed to address the merits of the proposal. Venezuela argues that the Chair simply found that the Tribunal, acting within its discretion, had adopted a reasonable procedure to deal with the request for reconsideration and that nothing in the Tribunal's reasoning or conclusions suggested a lack of impartiality. Venezuela also notes that the Chair's decision did not mention the observations Arbitrator Abi-Saab made in his dissent.166\n\n**A/R-127 [Curtis] / A/R-181 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal, 5 May 2014 (\"*Challenge Decision \u2013 Majority I*\").\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 25.\n\n230.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela rebuts Conoco's argument that the request for reconsideration had no foundation in law or fact or the ICSID procedure. Venezuela submits that it should not be necessary to cite authority for the basic proposition that a tribunal may reconsider its own interim decision in case still pending before it, the more so, if it was based on false premises. Venezuela also argues that, when referring to its application for reconsideration, Conoco Parties disregarded the fact that Venezuela had introduced incontrovertible evidence of Venezuela's good faith negotiation per the BIT standard. Even Prof. Abi-Saab's dissent pointed to the obvious facts that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier overlooked. Venezuela filed its challenge the next day, based on the refusal to reconsider the merits of the application which reflected a lack of impartiality, fully aware that mere disagreement with a decision was not grounds for disqualification.167\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 119-123.\n\n**(b)** The withdrawal of consent to Arbitrator's Abi-Saab resignation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nOn 25 March 2015, Venezuela proposed to disqualify Arbitrators Keith and Fortier. At that point, another disqualification proposal filed by Venezuela individually with respect to Arbitrator Fortier was pending (proposal of 6 February 2015) and the proceeding had been suspended.\n\n232.\n\nFor the disqualification proposal of arbitrators Keith and Fortier, Venezuela submitted, relying on Arbitrator Abi-Saab's comments, that they had displayed a negative general attitude vis-\u00e0-vis Venezuela, had advanced the interests of the Claimants and relied almost exclusively on their representations, which included flagrant misrepresentations of fact.168Venezuela submitted that their denial of consent to Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation reaffirmed their appearance of lack of impartiality. For Venezuela, their denial should have led to disqualification.169\n\n**A/R-125 [Curtis] / A/R-98 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Respondent's Submission on the Proposal to Disqualify Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier, 2 April 2015, \u00b6 3.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 49, 120.\n\n233.\n\nIn its written pleadings, Venezuela (Curtis) speaks of the purported \"withdrawal\" of consent to Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation following the delivery of this dissent.170Venezuela submits that Arbitrator Abi-Saab resigned for serious health reasons and that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier knew that he wished to resign for those reasons after submitting his dissent. Venezuela relies on a letter from Arbitrator Keith to the Parties, stating that \"[\u2026] [o]ver a lengthy period the two Arbitrators, particularly the President, have urged Professor Abi-Saab to complete his dissent and then, as he had himself indicated, to resign from the Tribunal so that the Respondent could appoint a replacement arbitrator [\u2026]. In the course of those exchanges, the two Arbitrators plainly did consent to the proposed resignation.\"171\n\n*See* for example, Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 56, 116, 117, 147; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 133.\n\n**A/R-61 [Curtis] / A/R-102 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Letter from Gonzalo Flores, Secretary of the Tribunal, to the Parties, (\"*ICSID March letter*\"), 4 March 2015.\n\n234.\n\nArbitrator Abi-Saab submitted his dissent on 19 February 2015, to the September 2013 Decision on Liability and Merits (the \"**19 February 2015 Dissent**\") and resigned the next day. Venezuela affirms, however, that after submitting his dissent Arbitrators Keith and Fortier withdrew their consent to the resignation. For Venezuela, it seems likely that they were influenced by Arbitrator Abi-Saab's dissent. This, Venezuela submits, was inexcusable, even if Arbitrator Abi-Saab's dissent played no role in their decision.172\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6133.\n\n235.\n\nThe Chair of the Administrative Council considered that there was no proof of bias because Arbitrators Keith and Fortier sought comments from the Parties on the resignation, who submitted conflicting views on the correct procedure and outcome. The Arbitrators had considered these views and issued an informed decision on 4 March 2015, when they communicated to the Parties that they did not consent to Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation. The Chairman also noted that arbitrator Abi-Saab had indicated that he would complete his dissent by the end of November 2014 and resign by the end of 2014; yet his resignation was not tendered until 20 February 2015, seven weeks before the quantum hearing and when the disqualification proposal against Arbitrator Fortier remained pending.173\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b654-56.\n\n236.\n\nVenezuela questions that the Chair's decision ignored that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier had unconditionally (\"plainly\") consented to the resignation, and that Arbitrator Keith had urged Arbitrator Abi-Saab to resign by 6 February 2015, not 31 December 2014.174\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 56.\n\n237.\n\nIn Venezuela's view, the Chair's decision failed to deal with the fact that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier asked for the Parties' comments related to the issues that formed the basis for the challenge, that it was inappropriate for Arbitrator Fortier, who was subject to a challenge, to take part in a decision, and that the Tribunal was in no position to decide anything, as the proceeding was suspended since 6 February 2015, when Venezuela proposed to individually disqualify arbitrator Fortier.175\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 54-56; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 133.\n\n238.\n\nHaving restated the factual background underlying the seven disqualification proposals made against Arbitrator Fortier,176 Venezuela submits in support of its annulment ground concerning Arbitrators Fortier and Keith that the facts questioning an arbitrator's independence and impartiality must not be considered in isolation but cumulatively, which the repeated decisions dismissing the disqualification proposals to Arbitrator Fortier failed to do.177\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 3-85.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 107, 108, 117.\n\n239.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela argues, among others, that the Chairman considered the facts in isolation, disconnected from the circumstances underlying the prior challenges. Had the correct standard been applied, Arbitrators Fortier and Keith should have been disqualified.178\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 126, 127.\n\n**iii. The Appointment of Arbitrator Bucher**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nConvention Article 56(3) provides that where consent to the resignation of a party-appointed arbitrator is denied, the Chair of the Administrative Council shall appoint the replacement from a person from the Panel. Venezuela submits that the purpose of Convention Article 56(3) is to prevent a party and its appointed arbitrator from obstructing the proceeding by orchestrating a resignation, not to penalize a party by depriving its right to appoint. Venezuela supports this with various excerpts from the *Travaux Pr\u00e9paratoires* and commentaries on the ICSID Convention.179\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 149.\n\n241.\n\nVenezuela then refers to other four cases where the resignation of a party-appointed arbitrator has not been accepted (*Holiday Inns v. Morocco; Pey Casado v. Chile; Enron v. Argentina; Toto Construzioni v. Lebanon*). Venezuela distinguishes these cases, pointing out that Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation was made for health reasons and not under pressure of the party who had appointed him; not under collusion with that party; or with a party prevailing on the arbitrator to resign to slow down the proceeding or to get a replacement by a more tractable person; or resigning for tactical purposes or following instructions from a government party. When the resignation is for a good cause, it follows from the *Travaux Pr\u00e9paratoires* that the other tribunal members would consent.180\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 150-153.\n\n242.\n\nHowever, in this case, Venezuela argues, those principles were not followed. The denial of consent, or rather the purported withdrawal of the consent which had been \"plainly\" given to Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation with the resulting appointment of a replacement arbitrator by the Chairman constitute a ground for annulment for improper constitution under Article 51(1)(a). This purported withdrawal of consent constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (see **Section A.2(1)** below).181\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 154.\n\n243.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela argues, among others, that the Conoco Parties do not dispute the fact that there never has been a denial of consent to a resignation for serious health reasons; and yet, they submit the Committee has no power to judge the legitimacy of the reasons behind the Tribunal's exercise of discretion under Convention Article 56(3) and Rule 8(2). This, Venezuela submits, is an untenable proposition, according to which no matter the circumstances, or the reasons for denying consent, or the inappropriate arbitrator conduct, the denial of consent followed by the denial to appoint a replacement arbitrator cannot be grounds for annulment.182\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 134.\n\n244.\n\nVenezuela also counters that it is shameful for the Conoco Parties to now seem to suggest that Arbitrator Abi-Saab was in good health pointing out that after his resignation, he attended a conference at which he was honored. Venezuela notes that one thing is to be honored at a conference, another thing is to serve the functions and carry the burdens of an arbitrator in a massive arbitration.183\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 135.\n\n245.\n\nOn Conoco's point that Venezuela did not challenge the replacement arbitrator, Mr. Bucher, Venezuela replies that the issue is not whether Mr. Bucher could be challenged based on personal qualifications, but whether Venezuela was deprived of its right to appoint an arbitrator of its choice, who certainly would not have been Mr. Bucher. Venezuela then refers to submissions it made in the arbitration expressing that it did not accept the appointment of Mr. Bucher.184\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 138. 139.\n\n**A.1(2) Improper Constitution as Argued by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela reiterates that the standard of the review requires the Committee to assess the facts and circumstances in the arbitration and determine whether the Tribunal members were and remained impartial and independent, without regard to earlier decisions on proposals for disqualification.185 Venezuela submits that **(i)** Arbitrator Fortier should have been disqualified for his relationship with Norton Rose OR LLP and that **(ii)** Arbitrators Keith and Fortier, together, demonstrated a general negative attitude towards Venezuela.186\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 117.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 115.\n\n**i. Arbitrator Fortier**\n-------------------------\n\n(a) Circumstances related to the Norton Rose \u2013 Macleod Dixon merger.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nVenezuela submits that Arbitrator Fortier should have been disqualified at an early stage, since October 2011, because of his relationship with Norton Rose. Venezuela explains that it expects Arbitrator Fortier to resign from the Tribunal as a result of the conflict of interests arising from the Norton Rose-Macleod Dixon merger.187\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 34, 40.\n\n248.\n\nVenezuela points out that Arbitrator Fortier accepted his appointment on 20 February 2008 when he was partner of Ogilvy Renault. At that point he made no disclosure. He nevertheless had the continuing obligation to disclose should there be any relationship or circumstance that could call his independence or impartiality into question. On 4 October 2011, with the merger which would become effective 1 January 2012, Arbitrator Fortier indicated that he had learned that Macleod Dixon's Caracas office was representing ConocoPhillips in certain matters, including ICC cases involving Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., and that Macleod Dixon was also acting adverse to Venezuela in some other matters. Arbitrator Fortier indicated he had made the disclosure at the first possible opportunity after the merger had been voted favorably, and that he did not consider these facts had any bearing on his ability to exercise independent judgment.188\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 35.\n\n249.\n\nVenezuela argues that any reasonable observer would have considered the above facts and relationships to raise justifiable doubts as to arbitrator Fortier's independence and impartiality. Also, the fact that Macleod Dixon acted as co-counsel with Freshfields, the Conoco Parties' counsel, only aggravated the matter, in support of an apparent bias incompatible with the ICSID Convention requirements of independent judgment.189In its Reply, Venezuela argues that any reasonable observer would consider an apparent bias arising from the fact that Mr. Fortier's firm had publicly aligned its interest with a firm: (i) that was contemporaneously acting on behalf of ConocoPhillips in other cases; (ii) that was representing ConocoPhillips in a parallel ICC arbitration dealing with the same facts, subject matter and Association Agreements; (iii) was actively representing several claimants against Venezuela and PDVSA and its subsidiaries.190\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 36.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 129.\n\n250.\n\nVenezuela also questions the fact that Arbitrator Fortier did not resign from the Tribunal but instead resigned from his firm, Norton Rose.191 Also, with his resignation, he sought to provide assurance that his ties with the law firm had ceased, and yet he continued his relationship with Norton Rose after his resignation became effective on 1 January 2012.192\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 38.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 131.\n\n251.\n\nVenezuela counters that the Conoco Parties omits the undeniable issue that there was a serious and extensive conflict of interest arising from the announced merger which was belatedly revealed by Arbitrator Fortier on 4 October 2011. Arbitrator Fortier also failed his legal obligation under Convention Articles 14 and 57 to disclose the conflict of interest as soon as he became aware of it. Venezuela notes that the law firm partners had voted on the merger at least twice when arbitrator Fortier disclosed the situation.193\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 123-128.\n\n252.\n\nVenezuela also rebuts Conoco's critique that Venezuela's inquiries into Arbitrator Fortier were inappropriate procedural behavior.194 It was only after Venezuela's requests for information that arbitrator Fortier announced his resignation from Norton Rose, and conceded he was aware of the conflicts of interests resulting from the merge a week before his initial disclosure on 4 October 2011.195\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 132, referring to Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 148.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 134.\n\n253.\n\nVenezuela also argues that the first disqualification decision failed to consider the circumstances surrounding the merger as creating an appearance of bias. The disqualification decision only evaluated the accuracy of Arbitrator Fortier's disclosures of October and November 2011.196 The decision also failed to determine that Arbitrator Fortier had an ongoing duty to disclose and investigate potential conflicts of interest where a law firm merger was to occur.197 The decision contravened the terms of Arbitration Rule 6, especially the *prompt* notice requirement, and wrongly limited the duty of disclosure to when an *actual* conflict of interest exists.198 Also, the decision cannot be considered reasonable, as it excused Arbitrator Fortier's lack of investigation due to his lack of actual knowledge of the circumstances. Yet, as General Standard 7(c) of the IBA Guidelines states, a lack of knowledge does not excuse a failure to disclose if the arbitrator made no reasonable attempt to investigate.199\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 136-147.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 148-166.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 151-155.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 157-164.\n\n(b) Arbitrator Fortier's continued ties with Norton Rose\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nVenezuela further argues that Arbitrator Fortier offered only a partial explanation regarding his ties with Norton Rose. Venezuela submits that, after leaving the firm, Arbitrator Fortier maintained a substantive professional relationship with Norton Rose's senior lawyers, which he failed to disclose. Arbitrator Fortier kept a close relationship with Mr. Valasek, partner at Norton Rose who was his assistant in the Yukos case, and with Ms Fitzgerald and Ms. Bendayan who assisted him in other cases.200Venezuela argues that Arbitrator Fortier made misleading and incorrect statements and misrepresentations, while he was fully aware of his continued professional and financial ties with Norton Rose. Venezuela submits that this failure to disclose forms \"part or pattern of circumstances\" that should have prevented Arbitrator Fortier from continuing to sit in the Tribunal. In Venezuela's view, the failure to disclose and the misrepresentations raised serious doubts as to Arbitrator Fortier's reliability to exercise independent judgment in the arbitration.201\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 49-55.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 57.\n\n255.\n\nFor Venezuela, the Committee's task under Article 52(1)(a) of the Convention is unaltered by the decisions of the unchallenged Tribunal Members rejecting the disqualification proposals, and the Committee should not \"accept that they can be seized with a 'cumulative record'\"202Venezuela recalls that the standard set by the *EDF* committee for assessing independence and impartiality under Article 14(1) is that of \"a 'reasonable third person, with knowledge of all the facts.'\"203\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 59.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 59, referring to *EDF Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 111.\n\n256.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela notes that its second to fifth disqualification proposals were all related to the professional relationship Arbitrator Fortier kept with Norton Rose despite him knowing that the firm was representing ConocoPhillips and other claimants in matters against Venezuela and PDVSA and its subsidiaries.204\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 169-172.\n\n257.\n\nVenezuela argues that none of the decisions on the second, third, fourth and fifth proposals examined or assessed the ongoing relationship Arbitrator Fortier had with Norton Rose, instead, the Chair of the Administrative Council dismissed them without deciding on their merits. The Chaironly assessed the \"new information\" concerning Mr. Valasek and dismissed the second disqualification proposal, finding the proposal was based on unsubstantiated allegations. The Chair overlooked the clear conflict of interest resulting from the ongoing professional relationship Arbitrator Fortier had with Norton Rose.205 Similarly, the unchallenged arbitrators dismissed the third proposal, without considering the continued relationship with Norton Rose. Instead, they found that the proposal was not based on new facts, and it was a request for reconsideration of the second disqualification decision.206 The unchallenged arbitrators dismissed the fourth proposal (prompted by the revelation of a relationship of Arbitrator Fortier had with a Norton Rose counsel) finding a \"limited tie\" to Norton Rose. This finding, Venezuela argues, shows the unchallenged arbitrators' failure to apply the correct standard.207 The unchallenged arbitrators also dismissed the fifth disqualification proposal (based on arbitrator Fortier's benefit from the use of Norton Roses' administrative staff even after his resignation). Venezuela submits that they imposed a higher threshold than that required by Convention Articles 57 and 14 when they found only \"an indirect and purely administrative tie with Norton Rose.\"208\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 173-176.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 178.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 179, 180.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 181-184, citing **A/R-153 [Curtis] / A/R-174 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Challenge Decision - Fortier IV*, \u00b6 16 and \u00b6 19(1).\n\n258.\n\nVenezuela argues that the decisions regarding the second, third, fourth and fifth disqualification proposals against Arbitrator Fortier were unreasonable since none of them applied the correct standard, namely, whether there was an appearance of bias as a result of arbitrator Fortier's continued relationship with Norton Rose.209 Instead, in the decision on the second proposal, the Chair decided whether Venezuela's allegations were substantiated and had merit.210 In the decision on the third proposal, the unchallenged arbitrators required Venezuela to prove actual bias (not an appearance of bias).211 In the decision on the fourth proposal, the unchallenged arbitrators required Venezuela to prove how a limited tie would lead to the conclusion of a manifest lack of impartiality.212 In the decision on the fifth proposal, the unchallenged arbitrators required Venezuela to prove a manifest lack of impartiality instead of an appearance of bias.213\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 187-199.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 188, 189.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 190.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 191.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 192.\n\n259.\n\nVenezuela argues that the unchallenged arbitrators and the Chair failed to consider the cumulative record of the proposals, thereby contravening the standard that required them to consider \"all the relevant facts.\"214 Even under the *EDF* standard, advocated by the Conoco Parties, the decisions on the second, third, fourth and fifth disqualification proposals were unreasonable as they ignored the standard of Convention Articles 14 and 57. These decisions were also \"plainly unreasonable\" as since they allowed Arbitrator Fortier to refrain from disclosing facts and circumstances that created an appearance of bias to the detriment of Venezuela's rights, ignoring the disclosure guidance of the IBA Guidelines.215\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 193.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6195-198.\n\n260.\n\nFinally, in its Reply Venezuela reiterates that, despite Conoco's assertion to the contrary, Arbitrator Fortier represented multiple times that he had severed all ties with Norton Rose. Venezuela supports this by referring to different passages of Arbitrator Fortier's explanations. The Committee should not let his misrepresentations go unnoticed and should annul the Award for improper constitution of the Tribunal.216\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 203-207.\n\n**ii. Arbitrators Keith and Fortier**\n-------------------------------------\n\n(a) Refusal to reconsider decisions\n-----------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nVenezuela explains that on 3 September 2013, the Tribunal, by a Majority composed of Arbitrators Keith and Fortier, issued a Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits, to which Arbitrator Abi-Saab dissented. On 8 September 2013, Venezuela asked the Tribunal to clarify certain conclusions since, according to Venezuela, the Tribunal had concluded that Venezuela breached an obligation to negotiate in good faith based on Conoco's misrepresentations and misapprehension of the evidence on record.217\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 64.\n\n262.\n\nVenezuela submits that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier were aware that their September 2013 Decision was based on errors, yet they denied reconsidering it. For example, the effective date of the Confidentiality Agreement the Parties signed before the arbitration, prevented them from submitting evidence on the compensation negotiations undertaken. The arbitrators also failed to consider the U.S. Embassy cables, which Venezuela maintains, evidenced that the Conoco Parties had misrepresented the facts related to the compensation negotiations. According to Venezuela, when denying reconsidering their Decision, Arbitrators Keith and Fortier simply recounted the Parties' positions and failed to analyse the facts and evidence showing that the September 2013 Decision was based on false factual premises and misrepresentations.\n\n263.\n\nFurther, Venezuela notes that Arbitrator Abi-Saab remarked that he considered Arbitrators Keith and Fortier had displayed a \"general attitude *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Respondent\"218 and had uncritically relied on the representations made by the Claimants in the arbitration.219\n\n**A/R-82 [De Jes\u00fas]** / **A/R-41 [Curtis]** , *Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion \u2013 Reconsideration Request*, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 70.\n\n264.\n\nVenezuela submits that a reasonable observer would question the impartiality of arbitrators who decide on such a basis, and, in any event, any reasonable observer would conclude that the accumulation of circumstances tainted the integrity of the proceedings. Venezuela notes that also Arbitrator Bucher, who replaced Arbitrator Abi-Saab, later questioned the correctness of the legal determination made by Arbitrators Keith and Fortier not to reconsider the September 2013 Decision.220\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 70, 72-75.\n\n265.\n\nIn these circumstances, Venezuela requests that the Committee annul the Award, as Arbitrators Keith and Fortier could not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\n\n266.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela argues that the Chair's decisions on Venezuela's first and second disqualification proposals failed to address the concerns Venezuela had raised in each of the respective proposals. Instead of addressing whether Arbitrators Fortier and Keith appeared biased, the Chair analysed whether the procedure followed by the Co-arbitrators to deny the reconsideration was reasonable or within the framework of their discretionary powers. Venezuela also reiterates that the statements of Prof. Abi-Saab and Mr. Bucher in relation to Arbitrators Keith and Fortier would make any reasonable observer doubt that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier could be relied upon to exercise independent and impact judgment.221\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 209-217.\n\n267.\n\nEven under the *EDF* standard, which the Conoco Parties support, the Chair's first decision was unreasonable. The Chair raised the threshold by requiring Venezuela to prove partiality instead of the appearance of partiality. The Chairman also failed to frame correctly the issues set forth by Venezuela, namely, Arbitrators Fortier and Keith's treatment of Venezuela's first request for reconsideration.222\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 218-221\n\n(b) Withdrawal of consent to Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nOn 25 March 2025 Venezuela proposed to disqualify Arbitrators Keith and Fortier on the basis that they could not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. The ground for this challenge as characterized by Venezuela, was the withdrawal of their consent to Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation of 20 February 2015. Arbitrator Abi-Saab resigned one day after the submission of his 19 February 2015 dissent on the September 2013 Decision in Liability and Merits.223\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 79-81.\n\n269.\n\nVenezuela notes that it launched this challenged at a time when the proceeding was suspended because another challenge launched individually against Arbitrator Fortier (the 6 February 2015 disqualification proposal) was pending. On 21 February 2015, the Conoco Parties wrote to ICSID and requested that the challenge to arbitrator Fortier be submitted to the Chair of the Administrative Council.\n\n270.\n\nOn 23 February 2015, Venezuela informed that it intended to appoint a replacement arbitrator. On the same date, the Parties were invited to make observations on Arbitrator's Abi-Saab's resignation. Venezuela submits it repeatedly raised concerns to ICSID and the Chairman of the Administrative Council about whether Arbitrator Fortier who at that time was subject to a challenge could part take in matters related to Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation. Yet, on 4 March 2015, the Parties were informed that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier did not consent to the resignation.224\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 83-86.\n\n271.\n\nVenezuela submits that the 4 March 2015 letter revealed that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier had first *plainly* consented to the resignation and had subsequently withdrawn that consent. Venezuela's request for more information on the exchanges between Arbitrators Keith, Fortier and Abi-Saab was denied. On 25 March 2015 Arbitrator Abi-Saab expressed his surprise over the withdrawal of consent, indicating that the arbitrators were aware of his poor health and at no point had they conditioned their consent to him submitting his dissent by a certain time.225\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 86-89.\n\n272.\n\nIn the circumstances, Venezuela submits, any reasonable observer would conclude that the Arbitrators Keith's and Fortier's withdrawal of consent was retaliation against Arbitrator Abi-Saab's dissent. Thereby, they could not be relied upon to exercise independent judgement and should have been disqualified.226\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 92.\n\n273.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela rebuts Conoco Parties' account of facts about Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation. For Venezuela, the relevant facts concern the resignation on 20 February 2015, not the timeliness of the dissenting opinion, as argued by the Conoco Parties.227\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 223, 224.\n\n274.\n\nVenezuela adds that despite the grave infringement that the withdrawal of consent entailed, the Chairman rejected Venezuela's second disqualification proposal. According to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention, the refusal to a resignation under Article 56(3) was designed to prevent collusion between the arbitrator and the party that appointed him. However, Prof. Abi Saab resigned for health reasons, a type of resignation which has been admitted in other proceedings. Besides, Arbitrators Keith and Fortier did not find collusion between Prof. Abi Saab and Venezuela.228\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 228-232.\n\n275.\n\nFurther, Venezuela argues that if the arbitrators sought to protect the integrity of the proceeding, then it would have sufficed with the resignation, without any need to curtail Venezuela's right to appoint. Conoco's reliance on *Carnegie Minerals* is misguided, because in that case Gambia was deprived of the right to appoint an arbitrator due to its failure to honor appointment deadlines in a mechanism the parties separately had agreed upon.229\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 233.\n\n276.\n\nVenezuela also questions Arbitrator Fortier's participation in the decision of whether to consent to the resignation, given that he was at that time subject to a challenge. Neither Arbitrators Fortier and Keith should have sought comments from the Parties on the resignation. The ICSID Convention does not establish such a procedure.230\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 235.\n\n277.\n\nVenezuela argues that considered as a whole, the facts would lead a reasonable observer to conclude that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier could not be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgment. The Committee should as such annul the Award and all other decisions made by the Tribunal for its improper constitution.231\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 236, 237.\n\n**iii. The Appointment of Arbitrator Bucher**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nVenezuela also argues that the Chair improperly appointed arbitrator Bucher when the power to appoint belonged to Venezuela, and this constitutes a ground for annulment for improper constitution under Article 52(1)(a).232\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 13.\n\n279.\n\nVenezuela asserts that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier were aware that their withdrawal of consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation would cause a vacancy which would be filled by the Chair of the Administrative Council under Convention Article 56, thus denying Venezuela's fundamental right to appoint a replacement arbitrator.233\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 91.\n\n**A.1(3) No Improper Constitution (Conoco)**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nConoco notes that Venezuela is asking the Committee to make a de novo review of every alleged fact and argument made in the arbitration, yet that is not the Committee's role. Even if the questions of arbitrator independence and impartiality are of fundamental importance, that does not change the relationship between the role of the committee and that of the body tasked with making the original decision. The Committee's role is not to determine if an arbitrator possesses the requisite qualities; the Convention and Rules already entrust that role to the unchallenged tribunal members or to the Chair of the Administrative Council.234\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 140.\n\n**i. Arbitrator Fortier**\n-------------------------\n\n(a) Arbitrator Fortier's disclosure of the merger between Norton Rose and Macleod Dixon\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nIn their Counter-Memorial the Conoco Parties describe Venezuela's five proposals to disqualify arbitrator Fortier as a \"prolonged tactical campaign\" to delay the Award and plan its annulment application.235\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 138.\n\n282.\n\nVenezuela submitted the first challenge on 5 October 2011, while the Tribunal was working on the 2013 Decision. On 27 February 2012 Arbitrators Keith and Abi-Saab dismissed the challenge. The challenge followed Arbitrator Fortier's disclosure on 4 October 2011 that a merger between his firm Norton Rose OR LLP and Macleod Dixon LLP would become effective on 1 January 2012. He also disclosed that he had learned that Macleod Dixon's Caraca's office provided services to the ConocoPhillips Company, was acting adverse to Venezuela's interests in certain matters, and was acting on behalf of Conoco in certain ICC proceedings involving PDVSA.\n\n283.\n\nConoco asserts that Venezuela did not attempt to meet the applicable standard under the ICSID Convention to show why the law firm merger gave rise to a manifest lack of independence and impartiality.236 Conoco puts forward its own account of the facts237 and argued that Venezuela mischaracterized the facts related to the challenges.238\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 145.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 144-153.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 154.\n\n284.\n\nConoco submits that following the standard applied in *Azurix* and *OI European*, Venezuela's application would fail on its face, because Venezuela never protested the procedures by which the disqualification proposal was resolved. Even if the standard applied in *EDF*, *Suez II*, and *Mobil Exploration* be followed, Venezuela still fails to show and cannot show that the arbitrators' rejection of the challenge was \"so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.\"239\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 156, citing *EDF Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 145.\n\n285.\n\nConoco argues that Venezuela's case for this challenge was that Arbitrator Fortier should have resigned, since he failed to disclose Norton Rose's communications with Macleod Dixon regarding the merger as soon as they occurred (no matter if he was involved in the communications or not). However, Arbitrators Keith and Abi-Saab reasonably concluded that those events could not form the basis for a disqualification. They referred to the relevant standards in Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention that Venezuela needed to meet. They also addressed the disclosure requirement under Arbitration Rule 6(2) and the IBA Guidelines. The arbitrators concluded that non-disclosure in this case did not lead to disqualification.240\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 158, 159.\n\n286.\n\nConoco asserts that Venezuela simply reargues the challenges and asks the Committee to make a new determination of Arbitrator Fortier's qualities under Convention Article 14(1). But whether Arbitrator Fortier met the requirements (which he did) is a question already decided by the unchallenged arbitrators; a decision they made based on the evidence and their factual findings.241\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 165.\n\n287.\n\nConoco also submits that Venezuela's argument that the decision on the challenge also constitutes a serious departure fails. It fails because Venezuela did not undertake any meaningful application of the standard of Article 52(1)(d) to the facts; and because it took the view that any annullable error under Article 52(1)(a) automatically constitutes an annullable error under Article 52(1)(d) without any support. Yet, Venezuela did not dispute that Arbitrators Keith and Abi-Saab followed the proper procedures for hearing and deciding this first challenge. Venezuela does not claim it was denied an opportunity to present its case on Arbitrator's Fortier independence and impartiality. There was no departure from a fundamental rule, let alone a serious one.242\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 168, 169.\n\n(b) Arbitrator Fortier's alleged continued ties with Norton Rose\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nVenezuela again sought to challenge Arbitrator Fortier on 6 February 2015, based on an alleged professional relationship with Norton Rose. On 1 July 2015 Chairman Kim dismissed the challenge.\n\n289.\n\nConoco summarizes the circumstances invoked for the challenge and submits that Venezuela fails to show that the Chair's decision on the challenge was so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.243\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 183.\n\n290.\n\nConoco asserts that the Chair acted properly and reasonably when he concluded that there was no basis to disqualify Arbitrator Fortier. Conoco notes that he assessed the standards of Convention Articles 14(1) and 57; and rejected Venezuela's allegations regarding the scope of Ms. Valasek's role as \"unsubstantiated.\"244\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 185, 186.\n\n291.\n\nConoco asserts that the question for the Committee is not whether the Chairman's reasoning was \"cavalier,\" as Venezuela characterizes it, or if a third party may share Venezuela's concerns. The question is whether the Chairman's decision was plainly unreasonable.245\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 189.\n\n292.\n\nFurther, the Chair's decision did not constitute a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Venezuela's arguments for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) are indistinguishable from those made under Article 52(1)(a). Here, Venezuela has failed to prove the existence of a fundamental rule of procedure or that the Chairman seriously departed from that fundamental rule.246\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 192.\n\n293.\n\nConoco observes that on 9 November 2015, Venezuela sought for the third time to disqualify Arbitrator Fortier. On 15 December 2015, Arbitrators Keith and Bucher dismissed the proposal.\n\n294.\n\nConoco notes that Venezuela submitted an expert report filed by Russia in the Yukos case supporting the allegation that Mr. Valasek had written portions of the Yukos awards. Venezuela's position is that if the report was true, then Arbitrator Fortier had failed to answer Venezuela's question about the authorship of the Yukos awards and the cumulative record showed that Arbitrator Fortier's disclosures were generally inadequate.247\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 194, 195, 202.\n\n295.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Conoco recounts the procedural background of the proposal,248 and argues that Venezuela again has failed to meet the required standard and has not shown and cannot show, that the rejection of this challenge was so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker would come to such a decision.249\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 195-200.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 196.\n\n296.\n\nConoco250 submits that Arbitrators Keith and Bucher acted properly and reasonably when concluding that the events referenced by Venezuela could not form a basis for disqualification. The Arbitrators recalled the standard of Convention Articles 14(1) and 57 and noted that Venezuela had not attempted to articulate that standard (paragraph 36 of the challenge Decision).251\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 204, citing **A/R-148 [Curtis] / A/RLA-49 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Challenge Decision - Fortier II*, \u00b6 36.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 205.\n\n297.\n\nConoco submits that Arbitrators Keith and Bucher considered that the disclosure obligation was governed by Arbitration Rule 6(2) (not by Venezuela's interpretation of the IBA Guidelines), which requires arbitrators to promptly notify the Secretary-General of any relationships with the parties or any other circumstances that may cause the arbitrator's reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party. Conoco argues that Venezuela had not identified a specific breach of Arbitrator Fortier's duty to notify the Secretary-General. All allegations relating to this basis had already been presented to the Chair when he rejected the second challenge. Accordingly, the Arbitrators rejected the challenge based on the \"cumulative record.\"252\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 205.\n\n298.\n\nIn addition, Arbitrators Keith and Bucher did not depart from a fundamental rule of procedure. Venezuela's arguments for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) with respect to Arbitrator Fortier are indistinguishable from those it makes under Article 52(1)(a). Venezuela did not meet its burden of proving (i) the existence of a fundamental rule of procedure; and (ii) Arbitrators Keith and Bucher departed from that fundamental rule of procedure in a serious way.253\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 208.\n\n299.\n\nThen, again on 26 February 2016, Venezuela proposed to disqualify Arbitrator Fortier. On 15 March 2016 Arbitrators Keith and Bucher dismissed the challenge. This challenge was prompted by a remark made in the von *Pezold v. Zimbabwe* award, which noted that a Norton Rose attorney was appointed as an assistant to that tribunal in February 2012.\n\n300.\n\nConoco recounts the procedural background of the challenge254and then argues that again Venezuela failed to show that that \"no reasonable decision-maker\" could have come to the decision to reject this fourth disqualification proposal against Arbitrator Fortier.255\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 217-223.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 224.\n\n301.\n\nConoco asserts that Arbitrators Keith and Bucher acted properly and reasonably when they concluded that the circumstances referenced by Venezuela did not form a basis for disqualification. Conoco notes that the Arbitrators recalled the standards of Convention Articles 14(1) and 57, and assessed whether Arbitrator Fortier had given an inaccurate account of the time that the assistant to the tribunal in the Zimbabwe case was appointed, thus creating the impression of lesser ties with Norton Rose than those that existed. But, by looking at the timeline of the assistant's appointment, which was in February 2012 with the parties' agreement, and the decision to appoint her by the tribunal in December 2011, Arbitrators Keith and Bucher were satisfied with Arbitrator Fortier's explanation.256\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 227, 228.\n\n302.\n\nConoco submits that Arbitrators Keith and Bucher acted properly and reasonably, and their conclusion was not objectionable nor plainly unreasonable. Conoco notes that Venezuela did not argue any infirmities in the process by which the arbitrators rejected the challenge. Conoco notes that in the *Favianca* arbitration Venezuela also sought to disqualify Arbitrator Fortier on the same basis, and that the tribunal also rejected the challenge, being satisfied with Arbitrator Fortier's explanations.257\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 231.\n\n303.\n\nFinally, Conoco argues that Arbitrators Keith and Bucher did not depart from any fundamental rule of procedure. Venezuela's arguments for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) with respect to Arbitrator Fortier are indistinguishable from those it makes under Article 52(1)(a). Accordingly, Venezuela has not met its burden of proving (i) the existence of a fundamental rule of procedure, and (ii) that the arbitrators departed from that fundamental rule of procedure in a serious way.258\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 234.\n\n304.\n\nOn 22 July 2026 Venezuela again sought to disqualify arbitrator Fortier. On 26 July 2016, the new Tribunal president, Arbitrator Zuleta, together with Arbitrator Bucher dismissed the challenge. According to Conoco, the challenge was based on Arbitrator Fortier's use of an administrative service firm also used by Norton Rose, which, in Venezuela's view, showed that Arbitrator Fortier had kept continued ties with that firm.259 Venezuela's position was that there was an affiliation between Norton Rose and the administrative service firm, and that Arbitrator Fortier should have disclosed this information earlier.260\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 235.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 244.\n\n305.\n\nConoco describes the procedural background for this challenge261 and then turns to the Arbitrators' decision on the challenge. Again, recalling the standard, Conoco submits that Venezuela has not shown and cannot show that \"no reasonable decision-maker\" could have come to the decision to reject this challenge.262\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 237-242.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 243.\n\n306.\n\nConoco asserts that Arbitrators Bucher and Zuleta acted properly and reasonably in concluding that the circumstances referenced by Venezuela could not form a basis for the disqualification. They relied on the standard of Convention Articles 14(1) and 57, noting that \"[t]he allegation that serves as the basis for the challenge, assuming it can be established, must be capable of being related to the present case, that is, that the particular facts must give rise to a manifest lack of independence and impartiality in this case.\"263\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 245, citing **A/R-153 [Curtis] / A/R-174 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Challenge Decision - Fortier IV*, \u00b6 12.\n\n307.\n\nConoco submits there was nothing unreasonable in that decision. The reasonableness of the decision is further confirmed by the fact that in *Favianca v. Venezuela* the same challenge was raised, and the arbitrators in that case also dismissed the challenge, concluding that \"a reasonable third person would not entertain serious doubts about Mr. Fortier's capacity to exercise independent and impartial judgement with knowledge of these facts.\"264\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 250, citing **A/CLA-83**, *F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/21, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L. Yves Fortier Q.C., Arbitrator, 12 September 2016, (\"*Favianca Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L. Yves Fortier*\"), \u00b6\u00b6 59\u201360.\n\n308.\n\nIn addition, Arbitrators Bucher and Zuleta did not depart from any fundamental rule of procedure. Conoco submits that Venezuela's arguments for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of Arbitrator Fortier are indistinguishable from those it makes under Article 52(1)(a). Accordingly, Venezuela has not met its burden of proving (i) the existence of a fundamental rule of procedure, and (ii) that Mr. Zuleta and Professor Bucher departed from that fundamental rule of procedure in a serious way.265\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 253.\n\n309.\n\nFinally, Conoco argues that Venezuela's \"cumulative circumstances\" argument also fails, because it is a mere attempt to engage the Committee in reviewing de novo the disqualification proposals.266Contrary to Venezuela's suggestion that the Committee can reach its own conclusions, what the *EDF*, *Suez II* and *Eiser* committees have ruled is that \"(i) where there was an opportunity to raise the relevant factual allegations during the underlying proceeding, they must be raised or are waived; and (ii) where a disqualification decision exists, an annulment committee \"does not write on a blank sheet\" but must approach a prior challenge decision with deference, overturning it if no reasonable decisionmaker could have come to the same conclusion.\"267\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 254; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 33.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 255.\n\n310.\n\nAccordingly, because all disqualification challenges were known during the arbitration, any challenge arguments raised and resolved must be treated with deference and reviewed against the \"wholly unreasonably\" standard, and any arguments not raised are now waived.268The Arbitrators rejected Venezuela's argument to revisit prior disqualification decisions to cumulatively consider the challenge.269 The sources on which Venezuela relies, only support the proposition that factors regarding an arbitrator's independence and impartiality may in isolation be an insufficient basis for disqualification, but may be relevant when considered in the context of other facts.270 Thus, Venezuela's attempt to relitigate its disqualification proposals on annulment fails as a matter of law and fact.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 256.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 259.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 261.\n\n311.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco notes that Venezuela brought four parallel challenges to arbitrator Fortier in *Favianca*, arising out of the same facts as in this case. All challenges were rejected. Conoco argues that other rational decision-makers reached the same conclusion confirming the reasonableness of the decisions by the unchallenged Tribunal members and the Chair.271\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 32, 33. See *Favianca Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L. Yves Fortier*, \u00b6\u00b6 59\u201360.\n\n312.\n\nConoco argues that, in any event, regardless of whether the Committee adopts a \"cumulative circumstances\" standard, the outcome would be the same, as the challenges to Arbitrator Fortier, whether assessed individually or collectively are unfounded in substance.272\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 39,\n\n313.\n\nConoco further notes that there are many factual inaccuracies in Venezuela's \"cumulative circumstances\" argument, such as that Arbitrator Fortier made his original disclosure only after Venezuela learned of it on the internet, Arbitrator Fortier was unable to answer questions without evasion, or that he made inaccurate disclosures.273 Contrary to Venezuela's assertion, the First challenge decision was not based on Arbitrator Fortier's resignation from Norton Rose, but rather on whether the content and timing of his October 2011 disclosure constituted grounds for disqualification, given that he had neither knowledge nor involvement in the merger.274\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 39\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 40.\n\n**ii. Arbitrators Keith and Fortier**\n-------------------------------------\n\n(a) The Reconsideration Decision\n--------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nOn 11 March 2014 Venezuela sought to disqualify arbitrator Keith and Fortier. On 5 May 2014, the Chair rejected the disqualification proposal. Conoco submits that this challenge was in response to the Arbitrators' decision of 10 March 2014 not to reconsider the Tribunal's 2013 Decision (the \"**Reconsideration Decision**\"), which held Venezuela in breach of Article 6(c) of the BIT by failing to negotiate in good faith with respect of the compensation payable for its expropriation of Claimants' investments.275\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 264-270.\n\n315.\n\nConoco argues that the Chair acted properly and reasonably when he concluded that the circumstances referenced by Venezuela could not form the basis for disqualification. The Chair's decision underscores the standard of Convention Articles 14(1) and 57, noting that the subjective belief of a party is not enough to satisfy the requirements under the Convention.276\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 278.\n\n316.\n\nConoco asserts that, after reviewing Venezuela's arguments, the Chairman found that the basis for the challenge was that Venezuela was dissatisfied with the majority's Reconsideration Decision and with the procedure leading to it, including the Tribunal's decision not to convene an oral hearing. The Chair then found that the Tribunal had adopted a reasonable procedure within its discretion and that there was nothing in the reasoning or conclusion of the Reconsideration Decision suggesting an absence of impartiality. On that basis the Chair considered that a third party reasonably evaluating the facts would not conclude that there was a manifest lack of the qualities of Convention Articles 14(1) and 57.277\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 279.\n\n317.\n\nConoco also submits that there is a tension between the arguments of Venezuela as represented by Curtis and as represented by De Jes\u00fas. Venezuela (Curtis) argues that the disqualification proposal was unrelated to the procedure adopted by the Tribunal; and criticizes that the Chair treated the proposal as a routine procedural issue failing to address its merits. This is despite the fact the Chair considered the reasoning and conclusions of the Reconsideration Decision and found nothing suggesting any absence of impartiality. In contrast, Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) requests the Committee to review *de novo* the procedure adopted by the Tribunal, while Venezuela (Curtis) acknowledges that the Chair already examined that process and found no basis to uphold the disqualification.278\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 280-281.\n\n318.\n\nContrary to Venezuela's contention, the Chair reviewed Venezuela's allegations in detail about Arbitrator Abi-Saab's dissent, and even quoted passages from Venezuela's pleading that incorporated his dissent. In any event, the Chair did not have an obligation to explicitly address each of Venezuela's contentions or to quote the dissent. Venezuela was heard, as it admits, and the Chair, having considered Venezuela's arguments, reached a conclusion that satisfies the relevant standard: a decision that is not so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to.279\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 282, 283.\n\n319.\n\nIn addition, the Chair did not depart from a fundamental rule of procedure. The mechanism for ensuring the independence and impartiality of the tribunal is the arbitrator challenge mechanism, regulated by Convention Articles 57 and 58 and Arbitration Rule 9. Venezuela undertakes no meaningful application of the standard for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) to the facts relating to this challenge to Arbitrators Keith and Fortier; it merely, without support, argues that any annullable error under Article 52(1)(a) *ipso facto* constitutes an annullable error under Article 52(1)(d). Venezuela does not deny that the Chair followed the proper procedures for hearing and deciding on this challenge and it was offered an opportunity to present its case. The annulment should be rejected as Venezuela failed to prove (i) the existence of a fundamental rule of procedure, and (ii) that the Chair departed from that fundamental rule of procedure in any serious way.280\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 284, 285.\n\n320.\n\nIn its Rejoinder Conoco maintains that Venezuela's (Curtis) Reply did not make any new arguments about the Chair's dismissal of the First challenge to the Tribunal majority. Conoco also rebuts Venezuela's (De Jes\u00fas) allegation that the Chairman raised the standard in its decision, requiring that Venezuela prove partiality instead of the appearance of partiality. The Chair applied the standard of Articles 14 and 57, finding that \"there is nothing in the reasoning or conclusions of the Decision on Reconsideration that suggests an absence of impartiality.\"281 Conoco also submits, contrary to Venezuela's contention, that the Chair considered Venezuela's alleged \"facts,\" including Venezuela's allegations regarding the Tribunal's First reconsideration decision, and concluded that those \"facts\" would not lead an objective third party to find a lack of impartiality, manifestly or otherwise.282\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 42.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 44.\n\n321.\n\nIn ruling on the First challenge to the Tribunal majority, the Chair did consider Venezuela's allegation based on Prof. Abi-Saab's dissent referring to the arbitrator's \"general attitude vis-\u00e0-vis the Respondent.\" In the decision on the Second challenge to the Tribunal majority, the Chair remarked that Prof. Abi-Saab's dissent only revealed a profound disagreement on points of law and evidence, but it was not proof of the arbitrators having a general negative attitude towards Venezuela. Venezuela has failed to explain how those conclusions were so plainly unreasonable that no decision-maker could reach them.283\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 45.\n\n(b) No consent to Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nOn 25 March 2015 Venezuela again sought to challenge Arbitrators Keith and Fortier. On 1 July 2015, the Chair of the Administrative Council issued a decision dismissing this challenge (and the second individual challenge to Arbitrator Fortier). Venezuela's challenge was based on an alleged general negative attitude of Arbitrators Keith and Fortier toward Venezuela, supposedly shown by their decision not to consent to Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation while the second challenge to Arbitrator Fortier's challenge was still pending.\n\n323.\n\nConoco argues, among others, that the Chair acted properly and reasonably when it concluded that the circumstances referenced by Venezuela could not form a basis for disqualification. Conoco submits that the Chairman assessed the challenge under the appropriate standard, which Venezuela does not contest. The Chair continued to examine the substance of Venezuela's proposal. The Chair determined that \"[a] third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the facts in this case would not conclude that Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier lack the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"284\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 328, citing **A/R-141 [Curtis] / A/R-175** **[De Jes\u00fas]**, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal, 1 July 2015, (\"*Challenge Decision \u2013 Majority II*\"), \u00b6 97.\n\n324.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Conoco Parties emphasize that Prof Abi-Saab resigned at the most disruptive moment possible, after withholding his dissenting opinion for well over a year. Conoco accounts the facts surrounding the resignation noting Prof Abi-Saab's participation in a conference four days after his resignation, where he made remarks indicative of disruptive conduct in relation to ICSID proceedings.285\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 51, 52.\n\n325.\n\nConoco also rejects Venezuela's position that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier \"withdrew\" their consent. They declined to consent to the resignation in the exercise of their discretion. They issued reasoned decision based on the resignation's disruptive timing and the unprecedented situation that ensued from the resignation. Consent could not have been \"withdrawn,\" since the resignation Prof. Abi-Saab proposed months earlier never took place, and the actual resignation occurred under different circumstances to which the arbitrators never consented.286\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 53.\n\n326.\n\nConoco adds that Venezuela's second challenge to Arbitrators Fortier and Keith was based on improper communications between Venezuela and Prof. Abi-Saab after his resignation, impropriety which Venezuela does not contest. The Committee should disregard Prof. Abi-Saab's email of 25 March , a communication which had no legal status in the arbitration. In any event, the arguments that Venezuela derives from that email are no basis for annulment.287The Conoco Parties also stress that Venezuela's position is difficult to reconcile: it acknowledges the \"procedural morass\" the resignation created during the pendency of the challenge while it claims a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure when Arbitrators Fortier and Keith decided not to consent to the resignation.288\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 54.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 57.\n\n327.\n\nConoco reiterates that Venezuela failed to show that the Chairman's decision rejecting the Second challenge to the Tribunal majority did not follow the appropriate procedures (*Azurix and OI European* standards) or that it was plainly unreasonable (*EDF, Suez II, Mobil Exploration*). The Chairman determined that a third party making a reasonable evaluation of the facts (including the language in Prof. Abi-Saab's dissents) would not conclude that the arbitrators lacked the qualities required by Convention Article 14(1).289\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 59, 60.\n\n**iii. The Appointment of Arbitrator Bucher**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nConoco argues that Venezuela has failed to show that the Tribunal was improperly constituted because of the Chairman's appointment of arbitrator Bucher. Conoco submits that the Committee's inquiry into the arbitrator appointments by ICSID is analogous to a review of prior decisions on arbitrator challenges, *i.e.*, if there was a failure to comply with Parties' arbitration agreement, which is governed by Convention Articles 37-40, 56-58 and Arbitration Rules 1-12.290\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 331.\n\n329.\n\nConoco refers to the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Carnegie Minerals v. Gambia* to support its argument that the right to appoint a replacement arbitrator is conditional. In that case, ICSID appointed an arbitrator on the respondent's behalf after the respondent failed to appoint within the time required under the parties' arbitration agreement. The committee rejected the state's annulment application and held that the right to appoint an arbitrator can be described as fundamental, but it is not unconditional, and a party may waive or be deprived of the right under the terms of the parties' agreement. The committee found that under the applicable rules the state had lost its right to appoint, and the Secretary-General had properly appointed in substitution.291\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 332, citing **A/CLA-101**, *Carnegie Minerals (Gambia) Limited v. Republic of The Gambia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/19, Decision on Annulment, 7 July 2020, (\"*Carnegie Annulment Decision*\"), \u00b6\u00b6 126, 146.\n\n330.\n\nConoco argues that just as Gambia's right was conditional under the terms of the arbitration clause, Venezuela's right to appoint an arbitrator was conditional under the terms of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules. In this case, since the Tribunal did not consent to the resignation under Article 56(3) and Rule 8(2), Venezuela lost its conditional right to appoint under the rules to which it agreed, and the Chair appointed to fill the vacancy under Rule 11(2.292\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 333.\n\n331.\n\nConoco argues that Venezuela's argument that a party may only be deprived of its right to appoint a replacement arbitrator in cases of improper conduct or collusion by the appointing party fails, because (i) Convention Article 56 and the Arbitration Rules do not define or limit the factors a tribunal may consider in deciding whether to consent to a resignation; (ii) there was no indication of collusion with or improper conduct by the appointing party when a party-appointed arbitrator's resignation was not accepted, and it is legitimate for a tribunal to consider procedural disruptions when deciding whether to consent; (iii) the commentaries Venezuela cites do not change the analysis and the language of Article 56(3) is unambiguous; (iv) the improper communications between Prof. Abi-Saab and Venezuela constitute improper conduct Prof. Abi-Saab's activities following his resignation are difficult to reconcile with his narrative.293\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 340, citing **A/CLA-78**, G. Abi-Saab, \"The Third World intellectual in praxis: confrontation, participation, or operation behind enemy lines?,\" 37 Third World Quarterly (2016), No. 11, 1957\u201371, pp. 1962\u201364, 1967\u201369.\n\n332.\n\nConoco argues that the criteria Venezuela intends to graft onto Article 56(3) (improper conduct or collusion) do not exist and cannot as a matter of treaty interpretation be implied into the ICSID Convention. However, if the criteria exist, there is ample suggestion of improper conduct.294\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 341.\n\n333.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco argues that Venezuela is requesting the Committee to make a *de novo* review of the Tribunal's decision not to consent to the resignation, which then led to the appointment of a replacement arbitrator. Conoco recalls that such a decision is at the Tribunal's discretion and Article 56(3) and Rule 8(2) do not delimit factors that a truncated tribunal may consider in deciding whether to consent to a resignation.295\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 67, 68.\n\n334.\n\nConoco also rebuts Venezuela's contention that Conoco's position regarding Article 56(3) is untenable. *First*, the plain text of Article 56(3) and Rule 8(2) do not define or limit the grounds a tribunal may consider, nor do they require to provide reasons. *Second*, Venezuela did not justify the standard it posits for the Tribunal's reasons or the review under Article 52. *Third*, no committee has ever reviewed the Tribunal's decision under Article 56(3) and the Committee need not do so here, since the Chairman already reviewed the Tribunal's exercise of discretion in connection with the decision on the Second challenge to the Tribunal majority. *Fourth*, if the Committee decided to review the Tribunal's decision under Article 56(3), the Committee should take guidance from the \"plainly unreasonable\" standard applied to the review of decisions on arbitrator challenges.296\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 69-74.\n\n335.\n\nConoco also defends its reliance on *Carnegie Minerals*. The Claimants never suggested that the facts of that case were the same as this one, but the case elucidates the legal principle that any right to appoint an arbitrator is conditional and can be lost under the terms of the parties' arbitration agreement. Just like Gambia's right was conditional under the terms of the arbitration agreement, here Venezuela's rights were conditional under the terms of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules.297\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 78 79.\n\n***A.1(4) T****he** **C****ommittee****'****s** **A****nalysis of the** **A****lleged** **I****mproper** **C****onstitution***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nHaving analysed the standard for annulment on the ground of improper constitution of the tribunal (**Section VI. Part 2(a)**), the Committee now moves to examine whether an Award rendered by an Arbitral Tribunal composed of Mr Fortier, Judge Keith298 and Professor Bucher withstands the Applicant's criticisms concerning improper constitution (**A.1(4)**).\n\nJudge Keith was president of the Arbitral Tribunal from its initial constitution on 23 July 2008 until his resignation on 21 March 2016 (A/R-76).\n\n337.\n\nThe Committee will first analyse the arguments presented by the challenging Party, Venezuela, as represented by Curtis (**A.1(4)(1)**), then and as represented by De Jes\u00fas (**A.1(4)(2)**). As with all other challenges, the Committee devotes no specific section on Conoco's arguments which have been already summarized above under the Parties' positions. Not being the challenging Party, Conoco's arguments in defence are only dealt with as the Committee analyses the grounds advanced by Curtis and De Jes\u00fas in support of Venezuela's challenge whenever this is useful for the Committee's demonstration.\n\n**A.1(4)(1) The Committee's analysis of the alleged improper constitution of the Tribunal as argued by Venezuela (Curtis)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Arbitrator Fortier (Independence and impartiality)**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe improper constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal because of Mr Fortier essentially rests on a five-prong criticism concerning his association with the law firm of Norton Rose of which he was a partner. A conflict of interest issue arose when a merger occurred during the arbitration proceedings with the firm of Macleod Dixon which advised adverse interests to those of Venezuela.299 Macleod Dixon notably represented Conoco, together with Freshfields, also Conoco's co-counsel in ARB/07/30, in a case against the state company Petr\u00f3leos de Venzuela (PDVSA) involving the Hamaca and Petrozuata Association Agreements also on issue in this arbitration.300\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 106, 107.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 9.\n\n339.\n\nMr Fortier clarified in his letter of 18 October 2011, to Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab about his resignation from Norton Rose with effect on 31 December 2011:\n\n\"*It should be of interest to you and to the parties to know that I have not been involved in any way in the negotiation which lead to the announcement of the Firm's forthcoming merger with Macleod Dixon. In addition, in reply to point (vi) of the Respondent's letter to you of 13 October 2011*301*, I have not taken part in or been privy to the plans (if any) 'for the coordination of the international arbitration group and the business plan for promoting the combined firm's expertise in this area.*'\"302\n\n**A/R-122 [Curtis]**, Letter with Appendices from Respondent to Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab, 13 October 2011.\n\n**A/R-53 [Curtis] / A/R-94 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Fortier October letter to co-arbs*.\n\n340.\n\nMr Fortier reaffirmed to the two other members of the Arbitral Tribunal on 17 November 2011, that he has \"*no knowledge of any file (if indeed any exists) 'on which lawyers from Norton Rose and Macleod Dixon have already been working together.' I can categorically state that I have had no involvement whatsoever in any such file, nor have I been made privy to any information about any such file*\".303\n\n**A/R-139 [Curtis] / A/R-148 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Letter from Mr. Fortier to Judge Keith and Professor Abi-Saab, 17 November 2011 (\"*Fortier November letter to co-arbs*\").\n\n341.\n\nThe Committee cannot accept the first prong of the Applicant's criticism304 that Mr Fortier must have been involved in the merger discussions between the two firms which according to the press, dated back almost a year before Mr Fortier's disclosure to the Secretary-General of ICSID on 4 October 2011.305 Macleod Dixon's presence in South America and Norton's Rose experience in arbitration with Mr Fortier's stature may provide explanations for the merger but not of Mr Fortier's involvement.306\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 14; **A/R-52 [Curtis] / A/R-93 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Fortier email to ICSID SG*.\n\n**A/R-52 [Curtis] / A/R-93 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Fortier email to ICSID SG*.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 91. Tr. Day 1, p. 153: 22-24.\n\n342.\n\nMaking a disclosure is not in any way an admission of an inability to serve. Quite to the contrary, the arbitrator feels capable to sit with independence and impartiality as the purpose of the disclosure is precisely to allow the parties to judge whether they agree with the evaluation of the arbitrator and to explore the situation further. It was not reprehensible for Mr Fortier to resign from Norton Rose, as he informed on 17 October 2011, after Venezuela challenged him on 5 October 2021, in reaction to the disclosure on 4 October 2011.307\n\nTr.

In such event, I will make arrangements with Norton Rose Canada in order for the time of these individuals to be billed to me by Norton Rose Canada. The only person who has assisted me in the present file is Ms. Rachel Bendayan, a junior associate of the Firm's Litigation Group based in Montreal, and she has already signed the undertakings establishing the ethical wall in place since 5 October 2011. Ms. Bendayan has not done any work in this matter since August 2011 and I will not call upon her or any one else from Norton Rose OR/Norton Rose Canada to assist me in this matter in the future.*\"308\n\nBecause Mr Fortier, Venezuela says, committed repeated non-disclosures in this regard, which were incomplete, misleading, or inaccurate,309 it was forced to request clarifications from him about the extent of his relationship with Norton Rose after it discovered evidence of this continued relation.310\n\n**A/R-53 [Curtis] / A/R-94 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Fortier October letter to co-arbs*.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 44, 102, 106.

Venezuela proposes the standard of an appearance of dependence or bias which is commonly used by *ad hoc* committees.311 The disqualification test is not whether bias has affected the decision (actual bias) but whether there exists facts and circumstances that give rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias in the fair-minded observer. The test is thus an objective one312 as the fair-minded and informed observer does not have an interest in the outcome of the arbitration other than the interest of advancing natural justice and due process.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 93-96. *Eiser Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 206; *EDF Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 109; *Suez Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 78.\n\n*Suez Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 78; *EDF Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 109-111; **A/RLA-47 [Curtis] / A/RLA-82 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Caratube International Oil Company LLP & Mr. Devincci Salah Hourani v.

The fifth prong of Venezuela's attack is that Mr Fortier had besides billing arrangements with Services OR LP/SEC (\"Services OR\") a wholly owned subsidiary of Norton Rose, for secretarial and other support services.313\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 26-44, 57-66, 71-83.\n\n346.\n\nThe Committee notes that the involvement of Norton Rose lawyers fell within the scope of the information provided by Mr Fortier on 18 October 2011 about continued assistance after his resignation of Norton Rose members to arbitral tribunals with the exception of the underlying arbitration. Ms Bendayan thus served from 18 October 2011 to 10 October 2014 as assistant to Mr Fortier in the Agility ICSID case314 and Ms Fitzgerald, another Norton Rose lawyer, as assistant to two Zimbabwe ICSID cases.315 Ms Fitzgerald's appointment, as pointed out by Venezuela, took effect on February 2012, however, her appointment was agreed before Mr Fortier's resignation on 31 December 2011.316 With that precision, the conditions of Ms Fitzgerald's appointment do not reveal an intrusion of Macleod Dixon in the proper discharge by Mr Fortier of his arbitrator's duties in the underlying arbitration. The same conclusion can be drawn for Ms Bendayan's appointment on the day when Mr Fortier informs of the assistance by Norton Rose's lawyers after his resignation. The Committee further concludes the same regarding Mr Valasek's role as secretary of the Yukos tribunals. The Applicant puts forward Russia's contentions in its efforts to resist the enforcement of the Yukos awards in 2015 which raised Mr Valasek's participation, far in excess of administrative tasks, as a \"fourth arbitrator\" in light of the remuneration received and of alleged authorship of the Yukos awards.317 That is however if \"*the expert report regarding the authorship of the Yukos awards were correct*.\"318 Relationships between an arbitrator and another arbitrator who are lawyers in the same firm may be considered as presumably subject to disclosure in the arbitration in which they sit. This would not assume that Mr Fortier bore the identity of the combined firm of Norton Rose-Macleod Dixon, which would need to be demonstrated. Even if Mr Valasek effectively performed an arbitrator's role in *Yukos*, there would still be a missing link as to how the situation in the Yukos tribunals affected Mr Fortier's independence and impartiality in the underlying arbitration.319\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.

The Applicant puts forward the episode of a staff member who described herself on the social media as an employee of Norton Rose.325 The billing arrangements between Mr Fortier's arbitrator practice and Services OR dispel any doubt that this was wholly erroneous. Mr Fortier had no financial interest in the activities of the combined Norton Rose-Macleod Dixon firm and the financial arrangements with Services OR do not disclose that Mr Fortier bore the identity of the combined firm. There is no causal nexus because we cannot find, as the Applicant claims, that the payment arrangements \"*could only be possible through an affiliation between Norton Rose and Cabinet Yves Fortier.*\"326 Having knowledge of Mr Fortier's desire to avoid the least possible disruption in his activities after 31 December 2011 by enabling the staff of his arbitrator's practice to continue benefitting from the same advantages offered by Services OR,327 the informed observer would not have regarded against the backdrop of Mr Fortier's resignation from Norton Rose the completion of his disclosure on services arrangements in 2016 as an indication of Mr Fortier's inclination towards interests adverse to those of Venezuela in the underlying arbitration.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 95.

For your additional information, I have no entitlement to any retirement benefit from the Firm.*\" (**A/R-53 [Curtis] / A/R-94 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Fortier October letter to co-arbs*).\n\n349.\n\nCould the circumstances surrounding Mr Fortier's situation amount to a real possibility of a lack of impartiality, if compounded with the \"*physical proximity*\"329 of Mr Fortier's professional abode in Montreal on the same floor as the reception area of Norton Rose330 and with the emotional attitude attributed to Mr Fortier when he resigned?331 The emotional ties are not however with Norton Rose but with Ogilvy Renault, the firm he stayed with for fifty years until it merged with Norton Rose in 2010.332 This is confirmed by a Canadian magazine article: \"*Fortier retains many good memories from his 50-year career with Ogilvy Renault where he was once chairman. There's still a strong sense of camaraderie with his former colleagues* [\u2026] *who first knew him as their mentor. They now know him as their friend*.\"333 A fair-minded observer would not find that the situation creates a commonality of interest between Mr Fortier and his former colleagues on the same floor, other perhaps than in tenant-landlord discussions since they all leased from a client of Norton Rose, such as to influence him negatively towards Venezuela. Nor would a fair-minded observer find that Mr Fortier's memories from Ogilvy Renault would have instilled in his mind an antagonistic approach to Venezuela's interests in the underlying arbitration because of Macleod Dixon's representation of adverse interests to those of the Applicant.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 46.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 45.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 16.\n\n**A/R-139 [Curtis] / A/R-148 [De Jes\u00fas] ,** *Fortier November letter to co-arbs*.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 45.\n\n350.\n\nDo the above circumstances display a negative attitude towards Venezuela on the part of Mr Fortier in the Award? The Conoco Parties suggest an answer: \"*Zero plus zero remains zero*.\"334 Venezuela argues that Mr Fortier should have been disqualified on the basis of the accumulation of these circumstances.335 A fair-minded observer who undertakes a holistic analysis of Mr Fortier's resignation from Norton Rose would not conclude in answering the Applicant's interrogation on the proper constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, that it gives rise to justifiable doubts regarding Mr Fortier's ability to make the Award as an independent and impartial arbitrator because Mr Fortier's interests were aligned with those of the combined Norton Rose-Macleod Dixon firm against the interests of Venezuela.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 35.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 108, Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 101.\n\n351.\n\nConoco highlights the reasoned and plainly reasonable character of the decision of Mr. Fortier's colleagues to reject his first challenge on 27 February 2012 in light of the forthcoming merger and the extent of Macleod Dixon's involvement in multiple matters adverse to Venezuela336 and of the Chairman's decision which rejected on 1 July 2015 Venezuela's second Proposal to disqualify Mr Fortier because of his professional and emotional ties with Norton Rose after his resignation in 2011.337 Conoco adds that Venezuela has also not shown that Judge Keith and Prof. Bucher reached a plainly unreasonable result in their rejection on 15 December 2015 of Mr. Fortier's third challenge by Venezuela by reason of Mr. Valasek's activity in the *Yukos* case338 and of the fifth challenge on 15 March 2016 regarding his assistance in the *Zimbabwe* cases,339 nor that Mr. Zuleta and Prof. Bucher reached a plainly unreasonable result when they rejected on 26 July 2016 Mr. Fortier's fifth disqualification proposal filed by Venezuela concerning the arrangement with Services OR.340\n\n**A/R-119 [Curtis] / A/R-146 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L.

Arbitrators Keith and Fortier (Independence and Impartiality)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nThe Committee therefore proceeds further with Mr Fortier's conduct in the underlying arbitration, this time because of his deeds with Judge Keith.\n\n(a) Refusal to reconsider the 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nThere is at first Mr Fortier's refusal, together with Judge Keith, to reconsider their majority Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 September 2013. Venezuela states that its attack is not disagreement on legal and factual issues but calls for a reasonable evaluation by a third-party observer of the evidence from which the conclusion of an appearance of lack of impartiality can only be drawn.341 Venezuela is guided in its criticism by the declarations of Prof. Abi-Saab, the dissenting arbitrator who observed the attitude of his fellow arbitrators.342 We take the dissenting arbitrator's most salient remarks underlined by Venezuela in its submission343:\n\n\"*the Majority Decision predicated, not on the basis of positive proof, but by divination or sheer fiat, a presumption \u2013 drawn from a single misconceived instance involving an error of fact \u2013 of a constant pattern of conduct attributable to the Respondent, of not hesitating to violate its obligations whenever it suited its purposes* [\u2026] *relying almost exclusively and uncritically on the affirmations and uncritically on the affirmations and representations of the Claimants throughout the proceedings* [\u2026] *But in order for this version to prevail, the Majority Decision had to neutralize any contradictory evidence* [\u2026] *as well as c) denying any legal significance and effect to 'whatever confidentiality agreement there was'* [\u2026] *In these circumstances, I don't think that any self-respecting Tribunal that takes seriously its overriding legal and moral task of seeking the truth and dispensing justice according to law on that basis, can pass over such evidence, close its blinkers and proceed to build on its now severely contestable findings, ignoring the existence and the relevance of such glaring evidence.*\n\n*It would be shutting itself off by an epistemic closure into a subjective make-believe world of its creation; a virtual reality in order to fend off probable objective reality; a legal comedy of errors on the theatre of the absurd, not to say travesty of justice, that makes mockery not only of ICSID arbitration but of the very idea of adjudication.*\"344\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25, 116.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 23; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 124.

The only allusion to the majority's state of mind is in the opening section of the above discourse:\n\n\"*This reasoning (ground, motif) of the Majority Decision is revealing in more ways than one. Apart from a general attitude vis-\u00e0-vis the Respondent, it reveals an important error in the establishment of facts on the part of the Majority Decision, by assuming that the Confidentiality agreement was in effect in June 2007, while it had on record before it evidence to the contrary*.\"345\n\n**A/R-41 [Curtis] / A/R-82 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion \u2013 Reconsideration Request*, \u00b6 16.\n\n356.\n\nThe expression \"*Apart from the general attitude vis-\u00e0-vis Respondent*\" depicts a negative perception of the Venezuela by the majority arbitrators, however, there are no indicators provided by the dissenting arbitrator of the suspected hostility that would comfort his subjective impression of these Colleagues' attitude. The developments on the supposed majority's gross error of judgment on which the dissenting opinion concentrates cannot be sufficient to show that these alleged procedural violations would be inspired by a will to do ill. A fair-minded observer would not find in such bare allegations, even if made by a co-arbitrator, a real possibility of a lack of impartiality. Venezuela brings no demonstration that the Award incorporating the 2017 Interim Decision which dismissed Venezuela's third application for reconsideration346 was contaminated by the refusal of Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier to reconsider the 2013 Decision and not made by a properly constituted arbitral tribunal with Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42** **[De Jes\u00fas]**, Award, dated 8 March 2019, (\"*Award*\"), \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n\n(b) No consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation\n----------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, Mr Fortier reaffirmed the appearance of a lack of impartiality when, he and Judge Keith withdrew their consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation on 20 February 2015.347 The decision of Mr Fortier and Judge Keith was conveyed to the Parties on 4 March 2015 with the following explanations:\n\n\"*Over a very lengthy period the two Arbitrators, particularly the President, have urged Professor Abi-Saab to complete his dissent and then, as he had himself indicated, to resign from the Tribunal so that the Respondent could appoint a replacement arbitrator. The President kept stressing the urgency of the matter and Professor Abi-Saab in mid-November, while saying that he still expected to complete the dissent by the end of that month, indicated that if he had not completed by the end of the year, he would have to resign in any event. In the course of those exchanges, the two arbitrators plainly did consent to the proposed resignation.*\n\n*The two arbitrators did not however consent to a resignation in late February when the quantum hearing was only seven weeks away and a challenge to one of the arbitrators was pending*.\"348\n\nThe terms of this decision, which was confirmed on 23 March 2015,349 make plain that Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation was ineluctable because of his health problems. The completion of his dissent to the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 September 2013, which he envisaged to do by the end of 2014 at the latest, was the only pending issue for Prof. Abi-Saab in order to formalize his resignation. The Applicant says that the issue before the Committee is whether Mr Fortier and Judge Keith had absolute discretion to deny consent when imperious health reasons are good cause for resignation.350\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 49, 116-117; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 134.

Withdrawal of consent was therefore not in issue. Prof. Abi-Saab himself admitted in his letter of resignation \"*I hope that by resigning at this juncture, before the oral hearings on quantum, I mitigate to some extent the negative effect that my resignation might have*.\"351 By disagreeing with Prof. Abi-Saab on the timing of his resignation with immediate effect on 20 February 2015352 as disruptive of the forthcoming quantum hearing on 13-17 April 2015 that had been planned since 1 August 2014 with Prof. Abi-Saab's consent,353 Mr Fortier and Judge Keith acted within the bounds of ICSID Convention Article 56(3) and ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2). These provisions have a wider prospect than preventing the collusion between an arbitrator and the appointing party. They aim at the expediency and non-frustration of the proceedings as well as the preservation of the immutability of the arbitral tribunal which is further endorsed by the Convention's provisions on the death and incapacity and disqualification of arbitrators.354 Prof. Abi-Saab's colleagues opined that a resignation in 2014 would not have disrupted the organization of the Hearing four months after but considered it disruptive even weeks before in February 2015. The Applicant's comment that \"[w]*ith respect to the timing of the quantum hearing, if Prof. Abi-Saab had resigned at the end of 2014, as Judge Keith and Mr Fortier apparently would have preferred, and respondent had been granted the normal time period to appoint a replacement, there is simply no way in which anyone could reasonably have expected the quantum hearing to take place on April 13, 2015, unless the replacement arbitrator would have gone into the hearing wholly unprepared. That is not a serious way to conduct a hearing*\"355 is a matter of speculation about what would have happened, should a replacement arbitrator have been appointed early 2015. It raises no justifiable doubt of a lack of impartiality of Judge Keith and of Mr Fortier.\n\n**A/R-142 [Curtis] / A/R-154 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Letter from Professor Abi-Saab to Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier, 20 February 2015 (\"*Prof. Abi-Saab letter to co-arbs*\").\n\n**A/R-68 [Curtis]** / **A/R-109 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *ICSID March letter II*.\n\n**A/C-89**, Email from the ICSID Secretariat to the Parties, 20 February 2015.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 321, 322.\n\n**A/R-60 [Curtis]** / **A/R-101 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Letter from Respondent to the Secretary of the Tribunal, dated 4 March 2015 (\"*Respondent 4 March 2015 letter*\").

It remains the turn-about of Judge Keith narrated by Prof. Abi-Saab in the same correspondence, which Venezuela says, can only explain by retaliation against Mr Fortier's second challenge as there can be no justification to consent on 6 February and to withdraw consent in matter of days after on the pretence of severe disorganization of the forthcoming hearing.359 We agree with Venezuela that, were this the case, the resignation sequence would be nonsensical.360 Conoco considers that the Chair engendered no annullable error in rejecting the second challenge to the Tribunal majority in its Decision of 1 July 2015.361 The Chair's Decision of 1 July 2015, pointed \"[*i*] *n their reasons Judge Keith and Mr Fortier noted that Prof. Abi-Saab had indicated he would complete his dissent by the end of November and that he would resign by the end of 2014 in any event. However, the dissent was not issued until February 19, 2015 and the resignation was not tendered until February 20, 2015*.\"362 The Chair found that \"[i]*t is evident that the Respondent and the challenged arbitrators differ on the appropriate procedure and the circumstances that would warrant a refusal to consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation under Article 56(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2). However, this difference of views does not demonstrate apparent or actual bias on the part of Judge Keith or Mr. Fortier*.\"363\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 56. **A/R-43 and A/R-132 [Curtis]** / **A/R-84 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Letter from Respondent to the Secretary-General of ICSID, dated 6 February 2015.

Judge Keith's allusion to Prof Abi-Saab's resignation as \"*the next step*\" can only be understood in this overall context and does not, in isolation, disclose as the Applicant claims,364 that he was ill-disposed against Venezuela to strip it of its right to appoint a substitute arbitrator. The refusal of resignation would not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias in the fair-minded observer. The Committee concludes that the decision of Judge Keith and Mr. Fortier has not tainted the arbitration and its outcome, Award.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 146.\n\n**iii. Arbitrator Bucher (constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nVenezuela's last contention on the count of Article 52(1)(a) concerns the appointment of Prof. Bucher by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, in violation of its fundamental right to appoint an arbitrator in replacement of Prof. Abi-Saab.365 Venezuela questions the participation of Mr Fortier together with Judge Keith in the decision of 4 March 2015 as Mr Fortier was under challenge since 6 February 2015.366\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 148-154; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 138.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 124, 136, 138, 144; Tr. Day 1, p. 162:11-23.\n\n362.\n\nArbitration Rule 9(6) reads: \"*The proceeding shall be suspended until a decision has been taken on the proposal*\" [to disqualify an arbitrator]. Arbitration Rule 9(6) prevents the continuation of the proceeding and the making of awards with an improperly constituted arbitral tribunal, avoiding thereby the repetition of such procedural steps with the newly appointed arbitrator.\n\n363.\n\nThe Committee interprets the ICSID Convention and Rules in light of their objective and purpose to encourage procedural efficiency and economy in the parties' interest. Such objective is fully attained with the suspension of the proceeding as envisaged by Arbitration Rule 9(6). The proceeding which are suspended cover all the procedural provisions of the case, including the working of the tribunal on the case, not the provisions on the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, resignation, disqualification and vacancies. Procedural efficacy requires that these provisions remain fully operative in order to resume the proceeding with a properly constituted arbitral tribunal. Arbitration Rule 9(6) suspends the proceeding not the arbitrators.367 It cannot be that Mr Fortier (and Judge Keith)368 would be suspended as of 6 February 2015 from participating in the resignation process while Prof. Abi-Saab would not be suspended from tendering his resignation on 20 February 2015.369 It would be otherwise hardly logical to give full force to Arbitration Rule 11 on filling the vacancy by calling a party to appoint a new arbitrator while freezing Arbitration Rule 8 which addresses the resignation process of the arbitrator prior to opening the vacancy and the manner of filling such vacancy.370 Not without amusement, the Conoco Parties note: \"*Venezuela is effectively asking this Committee to conclude that the Second Individual Fortier Challenge suspended the arbitration for everyone except Venezuela\u2026* [If Venezuela's position were correct] *then every party-appointed arbitrator who resigned during the pendency of a challenge to a different arbitrator would automatically be replaced by the appointing party rendering Article 56(3) meaningless*.\"371 Mr Fortier was under the duty to participate in the resignation process of Prof. Abi-Saab in order to allow the filling of the vacancy on the Tribunal. This also applies to Judge Keith.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 55. **A/R-60 [Curtis]** / **A/R-101 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Respondent 4 March 2015 letter*.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 54. Tr.

Venezuela wanted step 1 to be its appointment of Professor Abi-Saab's replacement; step 2 to be a decision on Fortier challenge. But if that had occurred, there would have been no step 3: there would be no decision on the orange action, no decision on whether to consent to Professor Abi-Saab's resignation, because Venezuela would have already appointed a replacement arbitrator. So Venezuela's approach just reads Article 56(3) out of the Convention.\"\n\n364.\n\nThe appointment procedure of Prof. Bucher in replacement of Prof. Abi-Saab on 10 August 2015372 accordingly complied with the ICSID Convention and Rules. We add that inviting the Parties to submit observations on the resignation of an arbitrator373 is excellent practice considering the importance of the immutability of the arbitral tribunal in the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. Besides, the Applicant does not state where and why the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules forbids arbitrators from addressing the parties on the issue.374 Collecting the parties' views on events which affect the existence or the validity of the composition of the tribunal cannot be considered as weakening the replacement process of an arbitrator. The Committee thus concludes that the Arbitral Tribunal was also properly constituted with the appointment of Prof. Bucher.\n\n**A/R-160 [Curtis]**, Letter from Meg Kinnear, Secretary-General of ICSID, to the Parties, dated 10 August 2015.\n\n**A/R-157 [Curtis] / A/R-158 [De Jes\u00fas]**, E -mail from Gonzalo Flores, Secretary of the Tribunal, to the Parties, dated 23 February 2015 \"*ICSID Email 23 February 2015*\".\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 121.\n\n**A.1(4)(2) Improper Constitution as argued by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Arbitrator Fortier (Independence and Impartiality)**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n365.\n\nThe improper constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal because of Mr Fortier, the arbitrator appointed by Conoco, essentially concerns Mr Fortier's association with the law firm of Norton Rose of which he was a partner. The issue arose when a merger occurred during the arbitration proceedings with the firm of Macleod Dixon which advised adverse interests to those of Venezuela, including Conoco in an ICC case together with Freshfields, Conoco's present co-counsel in ARB/07/30 against the state company Petr\u00f3leos de Venzuela (PDVSA) involving the Hamaca and Petrozuata Association Agreements also on issue in the underlying arbitration. We address Venezuela's first criticism of Mr Fortier's relationship with Norton Rose at the time of the merger which should have led him to resign from the Arbitral Tribunal.375 Instead, Mr Fortier decided to resign from Norton Rose as he explained to the other Members of the Arbitral Tribunal in a letter of 18 October 2011:\n\n\"*My decision to resign from Norton Rose OR is motivated by my desire to continue my practice as arbitrator and mediator without having to contend with the risks of conflicts inherent to being a partner in a Firm associated with a global law practice. It is a decision which I have been considering very carefully since November 2010 when Ogilvy Renault announced that it would join the international law practice of Norton Rose Group through a Swiss Verein as of 1 June 2011, and again following the Firm's decision, announced on 5 October 2011, to merge with Macleod Dixon as of 1 January 2012.*\"376\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.

Making a disclosure is not reprehensible and nothing in the facts and circumstances disclosed should be taken as an admission by the arbitrator of his inability to serve in an independent and impartial way, otherwise, the arbitrator should have resigned. Mr Fortier informed verbally the Secretary General of ICSID on 6 October 2011, the same day when the voting on the merger closed, then in writing on 4 October 2011377 of the situation created by the merger with Venezuela but maintained that it would have no bearing on his ability to exercise independent judgment:\n\n\"*I am making this disclosure at the first possible opportunity, the partners of the two partnerships involved in this merger having been presented with this possible transaction and called upon to vote on it between Saturday, 1 October 2011, and Monday 3 October 2011, and the merger having been announced on the morning of Tuesday, 4 October 2011*.\"378\n\nTr.

Venezuela proposes the standard of an appearance of dependence or bias which is commonly used by *ad hoc* committees.379 The disqualification test is not whether bias has affected the decision (actual bias) but whether facts and circumstances exist giving rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias in the fair-minded observer. The test is thus an objective one380 as the fair-minded and informed observer does not have an interest in the outcome of the arbitration other than the interest of advancing natural justice and due process.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 142. *Eiser Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 206; *EDF Annulment Decision*, De Jes\u00fas \u00b6 109.\n\n**A/RLA-47 [Curtis] / A/RLA-82 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Caratube Disqualification Decision*, \u00b6 54: \"'*an objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party*' *or, in other words, on the 'point of view of a reasonable and informed third person*'\".\n\n368.\n\nMr Fortier indicated in a letter to his two other colleagues on 17 November 2011, that he only:\n\n\"*apprised of the professional relationship between Macleod Dixon and ConocoPhillips Company late in the week of September 26* [2011].\"381\n\nThe Applicant contends that Mr Fortier concealed an obvious conflict of interest for approximately ten days between 26 September and 3 October 2011, which allowed his bias to linger throughout the proceedings.382\n\n**A/R-139 [Curtis] / A/R-148 [De Jes\u00fas] ,** *Fortier November letter to co-arbs*.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 128; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 156.\n\n369.\n\nThe fair minded observer would take knowledge that Mr Fortier also indicated in his disclosure to the Secretary General on 4 October 2011, that he conducted conflict checks when he became aware of the merger to take effect on 1 January 2012, and that an ethical wall had been put in place the following day, on 5 October 2011.383 In his letter of 18 October 2011, to the other members of the Arbitral Tribunal informing of his resignation from Norton Rose with effect on 31 December 2011,384 Mr Fortier declared:\n\n\"*Yesterday, I informed the members of the Executive Committee of Norton Rose OR (known before 1 June 2011 as Ogilvy Renault and referred to herein as the \"Firm\") that I have decided to resign from the Firm, effective 31 December 2011* [\u2026] *It should be of interest to you and to the parties to know that I have not been involved in any way in the negotiation which lead to the announcement of the Firm's forthcoming merger with Macleod Dixon.

There was thus no failure to disclose by lack of knowledge which Mr Fortier could have made reasonable inquiries into.387 Mr Fortier bore the identity of Norton Rose until 31 December 2011, when his resignation became effective. He however never had the identity of the combined Norton-Rose/ Macleod Dixon firm which came into existence only on 1 January 2012, and whose activities could not automatically have created a conflict of interest for Mr Fortier before that date. An ethical wall came into effect almost simultaneously with the public announcement of the merger. As the vote on the merger only occurred on 1 and 3 October 2011, a fair-minded observer, informed of such facts and circumstances, would not conclude that there would have been a real possibility of a lack of independence or impartiality on the part of Mr Fortier during the ten days which preceded his disclosure.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 159, 160.\n\n371.\n\nStill in his letter of 18 October 2011, to his colleagues, Mr Fortier further mentioned about his relation to Norton Rose after his resignation:\n\n*\"There are members of Norton Rose OR who have assisted me in certain files in which I serve as an arbitrator - e.g. by acting as Administrative Secretary to the Tribunal - whom I may continue to call upon for assistance after 1 January 2012. In such event, I will make arrangements with Norton Rose Canada in order for the time of these individuals to be billed to me by Norton Rose Canada. The only person who has assisted me in the present file is Ms. Rachel Bendayan, a junior associate of the Firm's Litigation Group based in Montreal, and she has already signed the undertakings establishing the ethical wall in place since 5 October 2011. Ms. Bendayan has not done any work in this matter since August 2011 and I will not call upon her or anyone else from Norton Rose OR/Norton Rose Canada to assist me in this matter in the future.*\"388\n\n**A/R-53 [Curtis] / A/R-94 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Fortier October letter to co-arbitrators*.\n\n372.\n\nMr Fortier, Venezuela says, continued to foster his professional relationship with Norton Rose despite his awareness that these constituted a conflict of interest. Mr Fortier maintained substantive professional relationships via close connections with three lawyers at Norton Rose which each demonstrate in themselves that he could not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and that collectively demonstrate that Mr Fortier's participation in the Arbitral Tribunal deprived the Applicant of its right to an independent and impartial tribunal.389\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 49. Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 202.\n\n373.\n\nThe Committee notes that the involvement of the Norton Rose lawyers fell within the scope of the information provided by Mr Fortier on 18 October 2011, about continued assistance of Norton Rose members after his resignation to arbitral tribunals to the exception of the underlying arbitration. The Applicant's complaint that Mr Fortier's disclosure was not a licence to maintain an ongoing substantive professional relationship needs to be grounded on elements that would evidence the inaccuracy of the information in his letter of 18 October 2011.390 Venezuela speaks of disingenuous misrepresentations.391\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 49.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 54.\n\n374.\n\nMs Bendayan served from 18 October 2011 to 10 October 2014, as assistant to Mr Fortier in the Agility ICSID case which does not detract from the disclosure even if her appointment was on the same day as Mr Fortier's announcement of his resignation from Norton Rose.392 Ms Fitzgerald, another Norton Rose lawyer, served as assistant to two Zimbabwe ICSID cases. Ms Fitzgerald's appointment took effect on February 2012, two months after Mr Fortier left Norton Rose, long after Mr Fortier's resignation according to Venezuela. However, her appointment was agreed before Mr Fortier's resignation.393 With that precision, the conditions of Ms Fitzgerald's appointment do not reveal an intrusion of Macleod Dixon in the proper discharge by Mr Fortier of his arbitrator's duties in the underlying arbitration.394\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 55.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 54, Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 179.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 189 refers to the Chairman's Decision of 1 July 2015 which noted that: \"*The fact that certain members of Norton Rose were acting as tribunal assistant in arbitrations presided over by Mr. Fortier has been known since 2011 and was included in his disclosure of October 2011. This was raised in 2011 in the First Proposal, which proposal was rejected by Judge Keith and Prof. Abi-Saab. The Respondent has provided no new facts in this respect. Accordingly, to the extent the current Proposal is based on this assertion, it is untimely and is rejected*\" (**A/R-141 [Curtis] / A/R-175 [De Jes\u00fas]***, Challenge Decision \u2013 Majority II*, \u00b6 66). This passage illustrates well the difference between the remits of a Disqualification Authority under ICSID Convention Articles 57-58 and of the Committee under Article 52(1)(a). It was plainly reasonable for the Chairman to reject a proposal as untimely. It would not be reasonable for the Committee not to examine the assertions made by Venezuela pertaining to Mr Fortier's independence and impartiality when its challenge of the Award under Article 52(1)(a) is admissible. It thus behoves the Committee to examine the facts in support of the challenge under Article 52(1)(a).\n\n375.\n\nThe same conclusion should be drawn from Mr Valasek's role as secretary of the Yukos tribunals. Conoco observes that the Chairman's Decision of 1 July 2015 which found that Venezuela's arguments on the scope of Mr Valasek's role were unsubstantiated and that, even if it was true that Mr Valasek acted beyond his stated role, there still was no causal relation between Mr Fortier's incapacity to exercise independent judgement and Mr Valasek's partnership in Norton Rose395 was plainly reasonable.396 We note the absence of a causal relation between Mr Fortier's incapacity to exercise independent judgement and Mr Valasek's partnership in Norton Rose, the deduction proposed by Venezuela that Mr Valasek necessarily espouses the Conoco Parties' position in the underlying arbitration as would be demonstrated by his laudation of Conoco's experts in an article, or his purported acting as a fourth arbitrator in the Yukos arbitration according to the allegations made by Russia in its efforts to resist enforcement of the Yukos awards which, in the Applicant's view, involved very similar issues to those of the underlying arbitration.397 There is no evidence that the continued implication of the Norton Rose lawyers under the above-mentioned circumstances gave rise to a financial interest for Mr Fortier in breach of the assurances given in the 18 October 2011 where he also disclosed that any remuneration would cease from Norton Rose as of 31 December 2011, including any retirement benefit.398\n\n**A/R-141 [Curtis] / A/R-175 [De Jes\u00fas]***, Challenge Decision \u2013 Majority II*, \u00b6 95.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 189.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 51-53, Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 175-177.\n\n\"*As of* [31 December 2011] *I will no longer be a member of the Firm and will thus cease to earn any remuneration from Norton Rose OR.

The Applicant submits that these business arrangements, like the continued relationship with Norton Rose lawyers, form part of a pattern of circumstances that should have prevented Mr Fortier's participation as an arbitrator.399 The Applicant refers to these arrangements as enabling Mr Fortier to benefit from his secretaries' services while not himself paying for their salaries or benefits. Conoco points to the Decision of the Chair of 1 July 2015 which held that the proximity of office space was irrelevant for determining Mr Fortier's independence and impartiality400 and to the Decision rendered by Mr Zuleta and Prof. Bucher on 26 July 2016 which considered that even if Venezuela's allegations on the benefits reaped by Mr Fortier from the arrangement were true, Venezuela had failed to show how those benefits affected Mr Fortier's ability as arbitrator or how they would lead a reasonable third person to conclude that Mr Fortier manifestly lacked the ability act impartially in the arbitration.401\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 56, 57.

Mr Fortier had informed in a letter of 22 July 2016, to the Secretary General of ICSID that he had billing arrangements for the staff who wished to continue participating in the insurance and other benefits offered by Services OR.402 On 26 July 2016, the unchallenged Tribunal members, Mr Zuleta and Mr Bucher dismissed the challenge,403 in advance of the hearing which was scheduled for mid-August 2016. A fair-minded observer, having knowledge that Mr Fortier paid Services OR for the staff which worked for his arbitrator's practice, would not have regarded such arrangements as an indication of Mr Fortier's inclination towards interests adverse to those of Venezuela in the underlying arbitration. The erroneous self-description on the social media of one of his staff members as employed by Norton Rose and instead of Services OR does not change the conclusion. To sum up, a fair-minded observer, with knowledge of all the circumstances of Mr Fortier's disclosure of the merger, would conclude, that the facts surrounding his relationship with Norton Rose, before and after his resignation from that firm, do not give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality. No appearance of bias existed from an objective point of view.\n\n**A/R-151 [Curtis]** / **A/R-151 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Letter of Mr Fortier to the ICSID Secretariat of 22 July 2016.\n\n**A/R-153 [Curtis] / A/R-174 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Challenge Decision - Fortier IV*.\n\n378.\n\nEven assembled, futile facts and circumstances cannot give rise to a reasonable suspicion of bias and are irrelevant to ground a challenge under Article 52(1)(a). Venezuela has failed to demonstrate from all the above facts and circumstances denounced in support of its Article 52(1)(a) ground the existence of an appearance of bias on behalf of Mr Fortier that would have materially affected the Award of 8 March 2019.\n\n**ii. Arbitrators Keith and Fortier (Independence and Impartiality)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nThe Committee therefore proceeds further with Mr Fortier's conduct in the underlying arbitration, this time because of his deeds with Judge Keith. The Applicant contends that the events demonstrate that neither of them could be relied upon to exercise independent judgment because of their general negative attitude towards Venezuela.404\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 61, 62.\n\n(a) Refusal to reconsider the 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nThere is at first Mr Fortier's refusal, together with Judge Keith, to reconsider their majority Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 September 2013. Venezuela finds guidance in the statements of Prof. Abi-Saab, the dissenting arbitrator, who characterized the attitude of his fellow arbitrators:\n\n\"*Apart from a general attitude vis-\u00e0-vis the Respondent, [the majority's reasoning] reveals an important error in the establishment of facts on the part of the Majority Decision, by assuming that the Confidentiality agreement was in effect in June 2007, while it had on record before it evidence to the contrary. Indeed, the question of the date of entry into force of the Confidentiality agreement was put to Counsel for the Respondent during the oral hearings. His answer was that it did not come into force until November 2007. This answer was neither challenged nor contradicted by the Claimants during the Hearings and was even confirmed by them later on.*\n\n*Thus, the Majority Decision committed a material error in establishing the facts. But worse still, it drew from it by inference, a grave legal consequence: not only that the Respondent has breached its confidentiality obligation by submitting to the Tribunal the Claimants offers of June and August 2007, when that obligation had not yet come into effect; but also, and ex hypothesi, that the Respondent would not have hesitated to do the same, i.e. submit to the Tribunal any proposition it would have made during the final period of negotiations, had they existed, in violation of its confidentiality obligation which indeed covered that final period. In other words, the Majority Decision predicated, not on the basis of positive proof, but by divination or sheer fiat, a presumption \u2013 drawn from a single misconceived instance involving an error of fact \u2013 of a constant pattern of conduct attributable to the Respondent, of not hesitating to violate its obligations whenever it suited its purposes*.\"405\n\n**A/R-82 [De Jes\u00fas]** / **A/R-41 [Curtis]**, *Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion \u2013 Reconsideration Request*, \u00b6\u00b6 16,17. Memorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 68.\n\n381.\n\nThe expression \"[*a*] *part from the general attitude vis-\u00e0-vis Respondent*\" depicts a negative perception of the Applicant by Mr Fortier and Judge Keith in the dissenting arbitrator's mind. On this point, the Committee considers that bare allegations, even made by a co-arbitrator,406 cannot be sufficient. There are no indicators provided by the dissenting arbitrator of the suspected hostility that would confirm his subjective impression. The dissenting arbitrator concentrates on the following developments on the majority's alleged gross error of judgment and ability to exercise sound judgment in evaluating the evidence presented to them:\n\n\"*22 \u2013 It is worth noting in this regard that, in order to reach its conclusions concerning the final period of negotiations, the Majority Decision, having admitted possessing no evidence at all for that period, had to make a leap of faith, encompassing three steps, a) relying almost **exclusively and uncritically** on the affirmations and representations of the Claimants throughout the proceedings, insisting that they did not receive any offer beyond the initial one concerning the Petrozuata and the Hamaca projects. But in order for this version to prevail, the Majority Decision had to neutralize any contradictory evidence by b) shedding away as lacking credibility the general statements of Dr. Mommer in his written and oral testimonies that Venezuela was always willing to pay just compensation, and that the negotiations failed because of the intransigent and exaggerated demand of the Claimants; as well as c) denying any legal significance and effect to \"whatever confidentiality agreement there was.\"*\n\n*23 \u2013 The error committed by the Majority Decision as described above, was easily detectable from the record at the disposal of the Tribunal at the time that Decision was issued* [\u2026].\"407\n\nTr. Day 3, p. 4: 23-25, p. 5: 1-23.\n\n**A/R-82 [De Jes\u00fas]** / **A/R-41 [Curtis]**, *Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion \u2013 Reconsideration Request*, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23 (emphasis added).\n\n382.\n\nVenezuela isolates the words \"*exclusively and uncritically*\" to allege that arbitrators who exercise their functions in that manner on the representations of one party lack independence and impartiality beyond doubt.408 However, a fair-minded observer would not find in the dissenting arbitrator's remarks on his colleagues proof of apparent bias. If Prof. Abi-Saab had become apprised of facts that disclosed his colleagues' negative attitude, they are not found in his dissenting opinion. His conclusion that:\n\n\"*It would be shutting itself off by an epistemic closure into a subjective make-believe world of its creation; a virtual reality in order to fend off probable objective reality; a legal comedy of errors on the theatre of the absurd, not to say travesty of justice, that makes mockery not only of ICSID arbitration but of the very idea of adjudication*\"409\n\nis no causal nexus between bias and the due process violations, especially the possibility that Mr Fortier and Judge Keith would have decided against Venezuela for reasons that are not in the arbitration record even if they would have performed poorly as adjudicators.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 70.\n\n**A/R-82 [De Jes\u00fas]** / **A/R-41 [Curtis]** , *Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion \u2013 Reconsideration Request*, \u00b6 67.\n\n383.\n\nVenezuela also submits that the dissenting opinion of Prof. Bucher (appointed in replacement of arbitrator Abi-Saab) to Venezuela's second Request for Reconsideration,410 shared the criticism of arbitrator Abi-Saab and would assist a reasonable observer to conclude that arbitrators Keith and Fortier were biased against Venezuela.411 The Applicant elaborates more particularly on Prof. Bucher's characterization that his co-arbitrators' position was \"categorical\" to argue that Mr Fortier and Judge Keith's \"*decision to deny Justice was '**categorical**',*\"412 so that Venezuela had no hope that arbitrator Keith and Fortier would hear Venezuela's case as fair and open-minded adjudicators. However, Prof. Bucher merely stated that the contents of a law article \"*did not have the effect of changing* [his] *Colleagues' categorical position*.\"413 This is a long way from facts raising a justifiable doubt that Mr Fortier and Judge Keith's refusal to reconsider was only motivated by hostility against Venezuela. Conoco reminds on that count that the First Individual Challenge of Mr Fortier was approached by the Chairman in a both reasoned and plainly reasonable manner.414 The Chair dismissed the challenge based on arbitrators Keith's and Fortier's refusal to reconsider their September 2013 Decision as he was simply unpersuaded by Venezuela's arguments that relied on personal perceptions expressed in a dissenting opinion.415 Venezuela has not shown how any appearance of bias on the part of Mr Fortier and Judge Keith having had a material effect on the Award which incorporates both the 2017 Interim Decision416 dismissing Venezuela's application for reconsideration of the 2013 Decision, and the 2013 Decision itself.417\n\n**A/R-25 [Curtis]** / **A/R-66 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Dissenting Opinion of Professor Andreas Bucher to the Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, 9 February 2016, (\"*Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion II \u2013 Reconsideration Request*\").\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 72.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 75.\n\n**A/R-25 [Curtis]** / **A/R-66 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion II \u2013 Reconsideration Request*, \u00b6 1.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 163.\n\n**A/R-127 [Curtis] / A/R-181 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Challenge Decision \u2013 Majority I*, \u00b6\u00b6 55-56. The Chairman recalled the relevant standards (Convention Articles 14(1) and 57), noting they do not require proof of actual bias, but appearance of dependence or bias (para. 52). The Chairman analysed under those standards the facts referenced by Venezuela in support of its challenge. The Chairman summarized Venezuela's arguments, finding that Venezuela was dissatisfied with the arbitrators' refusal to reconsider their Decision and to convene to a hearing on the request for reconsideration (para. 54). The Chairman found that the Tribunal had \"adopted a reasonable procedure that was within its discretion to regulate the conduct of the proceeding.\" Further, the Chairman found that there was \"nothing in the reasoning or conclusions of the Decision on Reconsideration that suggests an absence of impartiality.\" The Chairman, thereby, concluded that a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the facts in the arbitration, would not conclude that they indicate a manifest lack of que qualities required under Convention Articles 57 and 14(1).\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 38.\n\n(b) No consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation\n----------------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nThere is however more to the overall negative attitude of Mr Fortier and Judge Keith which, according to Venezuela, would result from the withdrawal of consent by Mr Fortier and Judge Keith to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation on 20 February 2015 as allegedly motivated by retaliation against Prof. Abi-Saab's Dissenting Opinion on the Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits.418 The refusal of Mr Fortier and Judge Keith to consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation was conveyed to the Parties on 4 March 2015 with the following explanations:\n\n\"*Over a very lengthy period the two Arbitrators, particularly the President, have urged Professor Abi-Saab to complete his dissent and then, as he had himself indicated, to resign from the Tribunal so that the Respondent could appoint a replacement arbitrator. The President kept stressing the urgency of the matter and Professor Abi-Saab in mid-November, while saying that he still expected to complete the dissent by the end of that month, indicated that if he had not completed by the end of the year, he would have to resign in any event. In the course of those exchanges, the two arbitrators plainly did consent to the proposed resignation.*\n\n*The two arbitrators did not however consent to a resignation in late February when the quantum hearing was only seven weeks away and a challenge to one of the arbitrators was pending*.\"419\n\nThe terms of their decision make plain that Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation was ineluctable because of his health problems. The completion of his dissent to the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 September 2013 which Prof. Abi-Saab envisaged to do by the end of 2014 at the latest was the only pending issue for him in order to formalize his resignation.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 78, 90.\n\n**A/R-61 [Curtis] / A/R-102 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *ICSID March letter*.\n\n385.\n\nThe principle of Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation was endorsed by the Majority arbitrators, however not the time of his resignation. Prof. Abi-Saab himself admitted in his letter of resignation \"*I hope that by resigning at this juncture, before the oral hearings on quantum, I mitigate to some extent the negative effect that my resignation might have*\"420 but referred to a \"*surprise 'withdrawal of consent'*\" in a later correspondence to ICSID.421 Mr. Fortier and Judge Keith acted within the bounds of ICSID Convention Article 56(3) and ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2) when they considered the timing of Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation (effective on 20 February 2015) as disruptive of the next steps of the proceedings, which consisted of the hearing on quantum that had been planned since 1 August 2014 to take place on 13-17 April 2015. These provisions have a wider prospect than preventing the collusion between an arbitrator and the appointing party. They aim at the expediency and non-frustration of the proceedings as well as the preservation of the immutability of the arbitral tribunal which is further endorsed by the Convention's provisions on the death and incapacity and disqualification of arbitrators.422 Prof. Abi-Saab's colleagues opined that a resignation in 2014 would not have disrupted the organization of the Hearing four months after, but considered it disruptive two months before in February 2015. Whether this is unacceptable because as Venezuela wrote to ICSID on 4 March 2015, \"[w]*ith respect to the timing of the quantum hearing, if Prof. Abi-Saab had resigned at the end of 2014, as Judge Keith and Mr Fortier apparently would have preferred, and Respondent had been given a normal time period to appoint a replacement, there is simply no way in which anyone could reasonably have expected the quantum hearing to take place on April 13, 2015, unless the replacement arbitrator would have gone into the hearing wholly unprepared. That is not a serious way to conduct a hearing*\"423 raises no justifiable doubt of a lack of impartiality of Judge Keith and of Mr Fortier who did not misuse their powers under Article 56(1) of the Convention for retaliatory action against Prof. Abi-Saab when health reasons are considered as good cause for resignation.424 Their refusal of resignation, and not withdrawal of prior consent to resignation, would not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias in the fair-minded observer. In Conoco's opinion, the Chair's Decision of 1 July 2015 dismissing the disqualification proposal was reasonable.425 The Chair acted properly when he referenced the applicable standards and then analyzed the facts referenced by Venezuela in light of those standards. On the arbitrators not consenting to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation, the Chairman found no appearance of bias, but rather that Venezuela's \"*conclusion of bias ignore[d] the reasons of Jude Keith and Mr. Fortier in the March 4, 2015 letter which expressly cite[d] the changed circumstances prevailing by March 2015*.\" For the Chairman, it was evident that Venezuela and the challenged arbitrators had differing views on the appropriate procedure and circumstances warranting a refusal to consent to the resignation; yet such differing views, the Chairman found, did not show apparent of actual bias.426 Hence, Venezuela persists in failing to demonstrate how Mr Fortier and Judge Keith could not be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgment to make a valid Award because of an alleged negative attitude.427\n\n**A/R-142 [Curtis] / A/R-154 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Prof. Abi-Saab letter to co-arbs*.\n\n**A/R-110 [De Jes\u00fas] / A/R-69 [Curtis]**, *Abi-Saab email to ICSID*.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 321, 322.\n\n**A/R-60 [Curtis]** / **A/R-101 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Respondent 4 March 2015 letter*.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 229, 231.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 328.\n\n**A/R-141 [Curtis] / A/R-175 [De Jes\u00fas]***, Challenge Decision \u2013 Majority II*, \u00b6\u00b6 78-84, 89, 90.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 25, 208.\n\n**iii. Arbitrator Bucher (Independence and Impartiality)**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n386.\n\nVenezuela's last contention on the count of Article 52(1)(a) concerns the appointment of Prof. Bucher by the Chairman of ICSID in violation of its fundamental right to appoint an arbitrator in replacement of Prof. Abi-Saab.428\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 91.\n\n387.\n\nThe Applicant alleges a breach of ICISD Arbitration Rule 9(6). Because of the suspension of the arbitration proceeding following Mr Fortier's challenge on 6 February 2015, he should not have participated in the decision of 4 March 2015 together with Judge Keith.429 It is beyond dispute that, not Mr Fortier, nor Judge Keith, but the proceedings were suspended on 6 February 2015 in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6) as a consequence of the disqualification proposal made by Venezuela on 5 October 2011.430\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 83, 85.\n\n**A/R-142 [De Jes\u00fas]** / **A/R-101 [Curtis]**, ICSID letter to the Parties informing proceeding suspended, dated 6 February 2015.\n\n388.\n\nIn ordering a suspension of the proceeding pending a decision on the disqualification proposal, Arbitration Rule 9(6) prevents the continuation of the proceedings and the making of awards with an improperly constituted arbitral tribunal and avoids the repetition of procedural steps with the newly appointed arbitrator. The proceeding which are suspended cover all the procedural provisions of the case, including the working of the tribunal on the case, not the provisions on the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, resignation, disqualification, and vacancies. Procedural efficacy requires that these provisions remain fully operative in order to resume the proceeding with a properly constituted arbitral tribunal.\n\n389.\n\nIt cannot be that Mr Fortier would be suspended as of 6 February 2015 from participating in the resignation process while Prof. Abi-Saab would not be suspended from tendering his resignation on 20 February 2015.431 Not without relevance, the Conoco Parties remark: \"*Venezuela wanted step 1 to be its appointment of Professor Abi-Saab's replacement; step 2 to be a decision on Fortier challenge. But if that had occurred, there would have been no step 3: there would be no decision on the orange action, no decision on whether to consent to Professor Abi-Saab's resignation, because Venezuela would have already appointed a replacement arbitrator. So Venezuela's approach just reads Article 56(3) out of the Convention*.\"432\n\n**A/R-142 [Curtis] / A/R-154 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Prof. Abi-Saab letter to co-arbs*. Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 354, Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 90: \"*Venezuela is effectively asking this Committee to conclude that the Second Individual Fortier Challenge suspended the arbitration for everyone except Venezuela* [If Venezuela's position were correct] *every party-appointed arbitrator who resigned during the pendency of a challenge to a different arbitrator would automatically be replaced by the appointing party -rendering Article 56(3) meaningless*.\"\n\nTr. Day 2, p. 136: 8-17.\n\n390.\n\nThe appointment of Prof. Bucher in replacement of Prof. Abi-Saab was therefore made according to the ICSID Convention and Rules. We add that inviting the Parties to submit observations on the resignation of an arbitrator433 is excellent practice considering the unique situation. The Applicant does not state where and why the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules forbids arbitrators from addressing the parties on the issue.434 Collecting the parties' views on events which affect the composition of the tribunal cannot be considered as weakening the replacement process of an arbitrator.\n\n**A/R-157 [Curtis] / A/R-158 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *ICSID Email 23 February 2015*.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 235.\n\n***A.2.

The Committee's analysis of the Parties' arguments on serious departure on this issue is addressed in **Section A.2(4)**.\n\n**A.2(1) Serious Departure as argued by Venezuela (Curtis)**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe right of a party to participate in the selection of arbitrators is a fundamental rule of procedure. Venezuela refers to various commentaries on the selection of arbitrators as a fundamental attribute of arbitration.436\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 156.\n\n394.\n\nVenezuela argues that Arbitrators Keith's and Fortier's withdrawal of consent to arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation deprived Venezuela of its right to appoint an arbitrator, thus constituting a serious departure from a fundamental rule which warrants annulment.437\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 157; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 128-140.\n\n395.\n\nA party may only be deprived of its right to appoint in exceptional circumstances caused by improper conduct of a party or the existence of collusion between a party and its appointed arbitrator. Venezuela was unjustifiably deprived of its right to appoint a replacement arbitrator after the resignation of arbitrator Abi-Saab for serious health reasons. The purported withdrawal of consent followed by ICSID's appointment of a replacement arbitrator constituted a serious departure giving rise to annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(d).438\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 158.\n\n**A.2(2) Serious Departure as argued by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nVenezuela argues that the facts of this case give rise to at least three circumstances in which serious departures from fundamental rules of procedure occurred. The first circumstance is the unreliability of Arbitrators Keith and Fortierin exercising independent judgment. The second is the participation of Arbitrators Keith and Fortier in deciding on Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation while the proceeding was suspended. Third, the Chair's decision to appoint a replacement arbitrator in lieu of Venezuela.439\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 95.\n\n397.\n\nOn the first ground, Venezuela submits the same reasons that warrant the annulment of the Award on the grounds of improper constitution of the Tribunal also warrant the annulment on the grounds that they give rise to a serious departure from the fundamental right to be heard by an independent tribunal. This is recognized by international law and Convention Article 14. Venezuela refers to the *Kl\u00f6ckner I* committee, which held that \"[i]mpartiality of an arbitrator is a fundamental and essential requirement. Any shortcoming in this regard, that is any sigh of partiality, must be considered to constitute, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d), a 'serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure' [\u2026].\"440 The committees in *Wena, Impregilo* and *Eiser* have also identified the right to be heard by an independent and impartial tribunal as a fundamental rule of procedure.441\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 103, citing *Kl\u00f6ckner Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 95.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 104, referring to *Wena Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 57; *Impregilo Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 165; *Eiser Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 239 quoting *EDF Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 123.\n\n398.\n\nAn independent observer would find that arbitrator Keith and Fortier could not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment, given Arbitrator Fortier's concealment of his ongoing relationship with Norton Rose, and the negative attitude of both Arbitrators Keith and Fortier towards Venezuela. The departure is serious because both arbitrators sat and deliberated when deciding on this dispute, including the 2013 Decision.442\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 105, 106.\n\n399.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela reiterates that if the Committee finds that there was improper constitution, it should also find that there was a serious departure under Article 52(1)(d) when Venezuela was deprived of its fundamental right to be heard by an independent and impartial tribunal.443 Venezuela also argues that under the *EDF* standard, relied on by the Conoco Parties, the Committee can examine both the allegations that the procedure to determine a challenge was flawed and that the lack of independence of impartiality meant that there was a serious departure.444\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 245.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 244.\n\n400.\n\nOn the second ground, Venezuela argues that Arbitrators Keith's and Fortier's withdrawal of consent to Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation deprived Venezuela of its fundamental right to appoint a replacement arbitrator.445\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 108.\n\n401.\n\nArbitrators Keith and Fortier withdrew the plain consent they had already given to arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation, relying on Convention Article 56(3) and Arbitration Rule 8(2). There has never been a situation where consent to a resignation for imperious health reasons has been withdrawn or refused on the grounds of Convention Article 56(3).446\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 109, 110.\n\n402.\n\nVenezuela asserts that the resort to Convention Article 56(3) was improper as it disregarded the grave consequences to Venezuela's fundamental procedural rights. The *Travaux Pr\u00e9paratoires* show that this provision seeks to prevent a party from frustrating the arbitration and is intended to remove the suspicion that the party may be involved in the resignation of an arbitrator. The *Travaux Pr\u00e9paratoires* recognize health issues as \"good cause\" to resign in \"good faith.\" In the underlying arbitration, the resignation was for serious health issues, known to the Parties and the Tribunal. Therefore, the invocation of Article 56(3) was improper.447\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 113-116.\n\n403.\n\nIn addition, Arbitrator Abi-Saab resigned *after* he submitted his Dissenting Opinion, as anticipated, and coordinated by the Tribunal. Arbitrator Abi-Saab confirmed that there was no deadline for his opinion.448 However, when withdrawing their consent and, thereby, triggering Article 56(3), Arbitrators Keith and Fortier explained that the quantum hearing was only seven weeks away and a challenge to one of the arbitrators was pending.449\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 118, referring to **A/R-110 [De Jes\u00fas] / A/R-69 [Curtis]** E-mail from Professor Abi-Saab to the Secretary-General of ICSID, 25 March 2015, (\"*Abi-Saab email to ICSID*\"), p. 2.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 119.\n\n404.\n\nVenezuela submits that there was also a departure when the ICSID Secretary-General invited the Parties and the Arbitrators Keith and Fortier to submit observations on the resignation, in circumstances that Venezuela had already informed (three days after the resignation) that it would appoint an arbitrator within 30 days. In Venezuela's view, while the invitation to submit observations was made formally under the cover of Convention Article 56(3) and Arbitration Rule 8(2), in reality it disregarded their content. Nothing in those provisions calls for the ICSID Secretary-General to request for comments from the parties on the resignation.450\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 120.\n\n405.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela submits that Conoco mistakenly relies on *Carnegie Minerals*. In that case, there was no debate that the right to appoint an arbitrator was a fundamental right and it does not support Conoco's proposition that a \"conditional\" right loses its \"fundamental\" quality.451 Venezuela also rebuts Conoco's argument that by agreeing to the ICSID Convention, Venezuela waived its right to appoint. Such a right is fundamental, established in Convention Article 37(2) and Article 56(3) and is only conditional in exceptional circumstances like collusion or improper conduct, which are absent here.452\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 250.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 251.\n\n406.\n\nOn the third ground, Venezuela argues that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier could not and should not have decided on the resignation while the proceeding was suspended. It asserts that Arbitrator Fortier was prevented from participating in any respect of the proceedings, which were suspended in accordance with Arbitration Rule 9(6) following the challenge pending against him. Venezuela refers to *AS Norvik v. Latvia*, where the unchallenged arbitrators noted that they could not entertain a request for provisional measures while the proceeding was suspended by operation of Rule 9(6).453 The breach of Rule 9(6) is in itself a departure, and the participation of Arbitrators Keith and Fortier in the decision on the resignation was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure which warrants annulment pursuant to Convention Article 52(1)(d).454\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 129, citing **A/RLA-56 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *AS PNB Banka and others v. Republic of Latvia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/17/47, Ruling on Power of Tribunal to Issue Provisional Measures Whilst Proceedings are Suspended, 24 September 2018, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 131, 132.\n\n407.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela reiterates that Arbitrators Keith and Fortier should have taken no action until Venezuela's second disqualification proposal against Arbitrator Fortier was resolved.455 Venezuela also submits that the issue is not that the arbitrators remained on the tribunal pending the decision on the challenge, but that the truncated tribunal (Arbitrators Fortier and Keith) withdrew their consent to a resignation while the arbitration was suspended. For Venezuela, even if the situation was unprecedented, the Arbitrators did not have the license under the Arbitration Rules to fiddle with the456 process.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 254.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 255, 256.\n\n408.\n\nVenezuela emphasizes that if the Committee followed the position of Conoco that it should limit review to whether the procedure under the ICSID Convention and Rules has been followed (*quad non*), the Committee would also find that the violation of Rule 9(6) warrants annulment of the present Award in full.457\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 258.\n\n**A.2(3) No Serious Departure (Conoco)**\n----------------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nIn relation to the Chair's decision on the First challenge to the Tribunal majority (related to the reconsideration decisions), Conoco argues that the Chairdid not depart from a fundamental rule of procedure. Conoco asserts that Venezuela, again, simply relies on the same points it makes under Article 52(1)(a); and undertakes no meaningful application of the standard for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) to the facts relating to the challenge to Arbitrators Keith and Fortier. It merely asserts, without support, that any annullable error under Article 52(1)(a) *ipso facto* constitutes an annullable error under Article 52(1)(d). Thus, Venezuela has failed to prove (i) the existence of a fundamental rule of procedure, and (ii) that Chairdeparted from that fundamental rule of procedure in any serious way.458\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 284, 285.\n\n410.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco also rebuts Venezuela's argument that the Chairman's decision on the Second challenge to the Tribunal majority (related to the failure to consent to the resignation) constitutes a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d). Conoco submits this argument is indistinguishable from one under Article 52(1)(a) and Venezuela made no effort and cannot satisfy this ground for annulment.459\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 62.\n\n411.\n\nRegarding the appointment of Arbitrator Bucher, Conoco argues that his appointment by the Chair is consistent with Convention Article 56(3) and Arbitration Rules 8(2) and 11(2), and that there was no departure (less a serious one) from a fundamental rule of procedure.460\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 286.\n\n412.\n\nVenezuela has not shown that there is a \"fundamental right to appoint a replacement arbitrator\" in general, nor in the ICSID context, where the appointment right is expressly conditional. Convention Article 56(3) makes it clear that there is no fundamental unconditional right to appoint a replacement arbitrator. That provision expressly contemplates situations, such as here, where the right to appoint a replacement arbitrator ceases to exist. In this case, the conditions for Venezuela's right to appoint a replacement arbitrator were not satisfied.461\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 344, 345.\n\n413.\n\nConoco refers to the committees' decisions in *CDC v. Seychelles* and *MINE v. Guinea* to argue that only rules of natural justice are fundamental, but not all ICSID rules are fundamental for the purposes of Article 52(1)(d).462 A party has a fundamental right to a fair proceeding before an independent and impartial adjudicator. Convention Articles 57 and 58 safeguard such fundamental right, and the mechanism those articles provide for was followed in this case.463In its Rejoinder, Conoco reiterates this point, noting that Venezuela did not identify any ICSID case where the appointment of a replacement arbitrator was held to be a fundamental right.464\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 345, 346, citing **A/RLA-59 [Curtis]** / **A/RLA-91 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *CDC Group plc v. Republic of the Seychelles*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Republic of Seychelles, 29 June 2005, (\"*CDC Annulment Decision*\"), \u00b6 49 (internal citations omitted); *MINE Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 5.06\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 347.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 81-85.\n\n414.\n\nThe commentaries to which Venezuela refers confirm that the right to appoint an arbitrator is not absolute. The relevant principle of natural justice is the right to an independent and impartial tribunal and there is no dispute that Arbitrator Bucher was independent and impartial. There was no departure, much less a serious one from the fundamental rule of independence and impartiality of the tribunal.465\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 349.\n\n415.\n\nOn Venezuela's contention that the failure to consent or the withdrawal of consent to Arbitrator's Abi-Saab's resignation was a serious departure, Conoco submits that there is a distinction between the body that decides whether to consent to a resignation, on the one hand, and the body that rules on a proposal to disqualify on the other hand. The proposal to disqualify is decided by *the other members* of the tribunal (except in cases referred to the Chair), while the decision whether to consent to a resignation is made by the *tribunal* which is temporarily truncated. Conoco refers to Schreuer's commentary on that distinction. What follows from this distinction is that in this case, the Tribunal composed of Arbitrators Keith and Fortier continued to function following Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation and Arbitrator Fortier remained on that Tribunal pending Venezuela's overlapping proposal to disqualify him.466\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 351, citing **A/CLA-57**, C. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2009) (excerpt), p. 1211, \u00b6 9.\n\n416.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision not to consent was not procedurally flawed. Venezuela recognized that Arbitrator Abi-Saab's resignation during the pendency of the second challenge to Arbitrator Fortier created an unprecedented \"procedural morass,\" not covered by the Convention and the Rules. It therefore is absurd for Venezuela to argue that a procedural question beyond the scope of the Convention and/or the Rules could be a fundamental rule of procedure.467\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 352; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 88.\n\n417.\n\nFurther, even if Arbitrator Fortier's participation in the decision was improper (it was not), it did not prejudice Venezuela, because Arbitrator Keith's withholding of consent to the resignation would have sufficed on its own. Under Convention Article 56(3), failure by the two remaining members to reach agreement would amount to a refusal of consent. Even if the pending challenge against Arbitrator Fortier had disabled him from taking a view on the resignation (which it did not), the result would have been the same, because Arbitrator Keith did not consent.468\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 353; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 89.\n\n418.\n\nFurther, Venezuela's position is impossible and would render Convention Article 56(3) meaningless. Venezuela submits that during the suspension of the proceeding (which resulted from the pending challenge) Venezuela should have appointed a replacement arbitrator, and then the replacement and Arbitrator Keith would decide the challenge. But in that sequence, the Tribunal would never have an opportunity to consent or not consent to the resignation as provided under Convention Article 56. The proceeding would have been suspended for everyone except for Venezuela. Such a result cannot be correct because it would entail that every party-appointed arbitrator who resigned during the pending challenge of a different arbitrator would automatically be replaced by the appointing party, thereby rendering Article 56(3) meaningless.469\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 354; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 90, 91.\n\n419.\n\nLast, the sequence of events caused no prejudice to Venezuela and honoured the ICSID Convention and the Rules. The Convention and the Rules recognize that only the truncated tribunal shall determine consent to an arbitrator's resignation. By contrast, the Convention and the Rules recognize two ways to decide a disqualification proposal: either by the unchallenged co-arbitrators or, in certain circumstances, by the Chair (of the Administrative Council). In the underlying arbitration, the Chair rejected the second challenge to Arbitrator Fortier *after* the Tribunal decided not to consent to the resignation. Had the Chair first rejected the challenge, and the Tribunal decided not to consent later, the outcome would have been the same. In sum, the result reached in this case honored the governing provisions of the Convention and Arbitration Rules.470\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 355; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 92, 93.\n\n***A.2(4) T****he** **C****ommittee****'****s** **A****nalysis of a** **S****erious** **D****eparture from** **F****undamental** **R****ules of** **P****rocedure in** **R****elation to the** **A****ppointment of** **A****rbitrator** **B****ucher***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nHaving analyzed the standard for annulment on the ground of serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (**Section VI. Part 2(c)**), the Committee will now deal with Venezuela's (Curtis and De Jes\u00fas) argument that the appointment of Arbitrator Bucher was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Committee will first address the arguments of Venezuela as represented by Curtis (**A.2(4)(1)**) and then as represented by De Jes\u00fas (**A.2(4)(2)**), including in each section, where appropriate, references to Conoco's arguments.\n\n**A.2(4)(1) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure as Argued by Venezuela (Curtis)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nAn unbiased and disinterested adjudicator is one of the pillars of natural justice. The Applicant rightly points to the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Eiser v. Spain*, which held that the right to an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal participates in the fundamental exigencies of a fair trial, the integrity of which is protected under Article 52(1)(d).471 It is also a question of natural justice and due process of which the independence and impartiality of the arbitrator are key facets. This comports with the main Human Rights instruments which, as underlined on many occasions by *ad hoc* committees, are relevant to the interpretation of the concept of a fundamental rule of law as used in Article 52(1)(d).472\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 114, footnote 263, Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 169: \"*independence and impartiality of an arbitrator is a fundamental rule of procedure*\". *Eiser Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 254; *CDC Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 49; *EDF Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 123.\n\n*Eiser Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 176-178; **A/RLA-149 [Curtis]**, *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V. v.

The nature of a fundamental right for arbitration has been recognized in this context,475 rather than under Article 52(1)(d) which preserves rules of natural justice.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 156; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 138.\n\n**A/RLA-88 [Curtis]**, Sundaresh Menon, *Adjudicator, Advocate, or Something in Between?

Thus, the importance of the right has to be taken into account in deciding the consequences of a party having been deprived of that right\").\n\n423.\n\nWith this reminder of the respective domains of the grievances of Article 52(1)(a) and (d), the Applicant's attack of Mr Fortier and Judge Keith under Article 52(1)(d) fails because of the rejection of its assertions under Article 52(1)(a). Independence and impartiality of both arbitrators are beyond the reach of the attacks that have been mounted. No irregularity affects the appointment process of Prof. Bucher which, as mentioned above, was made in accordance with the ICSID Convention and Rules.476 There is no reason for the Committee to intervene.\n\nSee \u00b6 364 above.\n\n**A.2(4)(2) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure as Argued by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nThe independence and impartiality of the arbitral tribunal is one of the facets of natural justice and due process. The right to an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal is recognized in the decisions of *ad hoc* committees as participating in the fundamental exigencies of a fair trial, in integrity of which is protected under Article 52(1)(d).477 Here, we cannot find that the right to an impartial and independent Tribunal has been violated. The Committee disagrees with Venezuela's appreciation of Mr Fortier and Judge Keith's situation478 that they could not be relied upon to exercise an independent and impartial judgment.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 103-104; *Kl\u00f6ckner Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 95; *Wena Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 57; *Impregilo Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 165; *EDF Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 123 ; *Eiser Annulment Decision*, \u00b6254.

The parties' right to participate in the selection of arbitrators has been recognized as a fundamental right within the context of the formation of the arbitral tribunal.479 Having rejected the Applicant's annulment ground under Article 52(1)(a) regarding Mr Fortier's and Judge Keith's attitude concerning their refusal to consent to Prof. Abi-Saab's resignation, their decision cannot have vitiated the reconstitution of the arbitral tribunal with the nomination of Prof. Bucher or caused any departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Prof. Bucher was appointed in replacement of Prof. Abi-Saab in accordance with the ICSID Convention and Rules as already remarked.480 We add that asking the parties for their comments on the resignation of an arbitrator is, as earlier remarked (see paras. 361, 387), not a breach of the ICSID Rules nor a breach of a fundamental rule of procedure. The frustration of Venezuela's right to appoint an arbitrator alleged under ICSID Convention Article 56 and Arbitration Rule 6 fails accordingly.481\n\n*Carnegie Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 126.

GROUNDS RELATED TO THE TRIBUNAL'S EXERCISE OF JURISDICTION: MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS AND FAILURE TO STATE REASONS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n427.\n\nVenezuela (De Jes\u00fas and Curtis) invokes two different grounds in relation to the Tribunal's findings on jurisdiction. On the one hand, it invokes the ground of manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) based on the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction over **(i)** the Conoco Phillips Dutch companies (CPZ, CPH and CGP) and **(ii)** the indirect investments of CPH and CGP.483On the other hand, it invokes failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) for the Tribunal's findings on jurisdiction for each (i) and (ii).\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 135; Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6 762\n\n428.\n\nThe Committee summarizes the Parties' arguments on the alleged manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons in relation to the Tribunal's jurisdictional findings regarding the Dutch companies' claims and Treaty Abuse (**B.1.**) and the indirect investments of CPH and CGP (**B.2**).

(\"**CPZ**\"), ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. (\"**CPH**\") and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. (\"**CGP**\"), the Dutch companies, into the corporate structure solely to get the BIT's protection and access to ICSID, at a time when legal changes were taking place in Venezuela that affected ConocoPhillips' interests.

None of these companies had any business operations, business of any kind, or employees in the Netherlands.487\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 764.\n\n432.\n\nVenezuela recounts the transactions made in 2005 and 2006 to insert CPZ, CGP, and CPH into ConocoPhillips's corporate chain, respectively, into the Petrozuata, Corocoro and Hamaca Projects. Yet, it was not until 31 January 2007 that ConocoPhillips revealed the existence of Dutch companies CPZ, CGP and CPH, which subsequently became Claimants in the arbitration.488\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 769, referring to **A/C-69** (previously **C-36)**, Letter from Roy Lyons, President of Conoco Phillips Latin America, to Rafael Ram\u00edrez, Minister of Popular Power for Energy and Petroleum, and others, 31 January 2007 (\"*Mr. Lyons letter*\").\n\n433.\n\nIn Venezuela's view, ConocoPhillips' corporate restructuring constituted treaty abuse and the Tribunal should have dismissed the claims based on the \"corporations of convenience.\" In its 2013 Decision, the Tribunal recognized it had to prevent the abuse of the investment protection system under the ICSID Convention, so that only investments made in good faith are protected. The Tribunal recounted cases and concluded there was a \"growing body of decisions placing some limits on the investor's choice of corporate form, even if it complies with the relevant technical definition in the treaty text.\"489 In addition, Venezuela submits that the Tribunal noted in the 2013 Decision \"that the only business purpose of the restructuring, as acknowledged by Claimants' principal witness on this matter, was to be able to have access to ICSID proceedings.\"490 Thereby, the issue of treaty abuse turns entirely on the foreseeability of the disputes at the time of the restructuring.491\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 772 and Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 418, citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 274.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 422, citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 279.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 422.\n\n434.\n\nVenezuela recounts several cases of abuse of process and treaty abuse492 to conclude that all factors identified in those cases were present also here: the timing of the restructuring (a decade after the Projects were entered and after the dispute had arisen or was foreseeable); no business purpose (sole motivation was to gain ICSID access); without Venezuela's consent (unlike other cases treaty abuse cases, here the host State did not consent and ConocoPhillips did not disclose the existence of the Dutch companies until October 2006); reshuffling of interests within a corporate family to gain ICSID access (there was no bona fide transfer of investments to a third party).493 In its Reply, Venezuela again relies on *Phoenix v. Czech Republic* to submit that it is well settled that treaty abuse exists when an investment is restructured with the sole purpose of gaining ICSID access when the disputes have arisen or are foreseeable.494\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 773-788\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 788.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 416, citing **R-120** (submitted by De Jes\u00fas as **A/RLA-88**), *Phoenix Action Ltd. v.

Venezuela's recounting of the facts starts on 10 October 2004, with Venezuela's suspension of the 1% royalty holiday, and ends with the 2007 January- June migration and nationalization process, with the restructuring occurring in between.495\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 789; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 424.\n\n436.\n\nVenezuela concludes that given these events, it is not credible that Conoco did not reasonably foresee the expropriation claim, and the Tribunal's finding of jurisdiction under these circumstances was a manifest excess of powers that warrants annulment.496 Venezuela notes that in their Memorial, the Conoco Parties do not dispute any of the facts or evidence on which Venezuela bases its position, Neither do the Conoco Parties dispute the legal principles invoked by Venezuela. The Tribunal's decision on treaty abuse should have been a straightforward application of the law to the undisputed facts.497 However, the Tribunal refused to apply the principle of treaty abuse and ignored the foreseeability test.498\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 790.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 419.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 426, 433.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons** **(C****urtis****)***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n437.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal's decision to exercise jurisdiction over the Dutch companies notwithstanding the treaty abuse also suffers from a failure to state reasons.\n\n438.\n\nVenezuela submits that the Tribunal concluded that there was no treaty abuse, notwithstanding its finding in the 2013 Decision that ConocoPhillips restructured its investments in 2005 and 2006 with the sole purpose of accessing ICSID arbitration and the Conoco Parties' admissions in relation to the foreseeability of the dispute.499\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 792.\n\n439.\n\nParagraph 279 of the 2013 Decision expressly recognized that the only business purpose of the restructuring, as recognized by the Claimants, was access to ICSID proceedings.500 Also, Venezuela maintains, that the Conoco Parties admitted in the arbitration that the disputes were foreseeable, when they acknowledged that (i) by the Summer of 2005 ConocoPhillips concluded that there was a risk that Venezuela would take actions against their investments; (ii) the \"patent aggressiveness\"501 of the government revealed a significant risk to the ConocoPhillips investments; and (iii) if the government repealed the Foreign Investment Law the company would be left without forum to pursue claims for expropriation.502\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 792 and Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 435, citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 279.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 792, citing **A/R-183 [Curtis]** / **A/R-164 [De Jes\u00fas]**, ConocoPhillips Reply on the Merits, dated 2 November 2009, (\"*Claimants' Reply on Merits*\"), \u00b6 120.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 792, citing **A/R-183 [Curtis]** / **A/R-164 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Claimants' Reply on Merits*, \u00b6 337; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 427\n\n440.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion that there was no abuse of right does not follow from the Tribunal's finding in its 2013 Decision, nor does it follow from the Conoco Parties' admissions in the arbitration. The lack of a cogent explanation constitutes a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n441.\n\nVenezuela also argues that the 2013 Decision does not deal with the foreseeable nature of the expropriation claim. The Tribunal failed to address the argument that jurisdiction cannot be exercised by a restructuring into a treaty country where the claim is foreseeable. In its Reply, Venezuela submits that the Tribunal in the 2013 Decision only dealt with jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, and omitted the real issue of treaty abuse which concerns the transfer of ownership when a dispute is foreseeable.503 Also, in the 2013 Decision the Tribunal attached relevance to the Conoco Parties' wish to continue to carry out the projects, yet that fact has nothing to do with the issue of foreseeability of the dispute.504 The failure to address that material issue also constitutes a failure to state reasons within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) and warrants annulment of the Award.505\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 434-436, citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6\u00b6 278, 279.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 437 citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 280; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 438,\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 793.\n\n**B.1(2) Manifest Excess of Powers and Failure to State Reasons as argued by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers** **(D****e** **J****es\u00fas****)***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Manifest excess of powers for failure to apply the law, concerning the doctrine of treaty abuse.*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nUndergoing corporate restructuring for the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID in anticipation of a dispute is treaty abuse.506 In the arbitration, Venezuela argued that ConocoPhillips had abusively inserted the Dutch companies in the chain of ownership by creating CPZ, CPH and CGP, solely to gain access to ICSID arbitration at a time when legal changes were taking place in the Venezuelan petroleum industry and when ConocoPhillips foresaw the dispute it later referred to arbitration.507\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 771.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 147.\n\n443.\n\nVenezuela notes that ConocoPhillips admitted to inserting the Dutch companies solely to gain ICSID access under the BIT.508 ConocoPhillips also acknowledged that before the restructuring it had asserted claims against Venezuela in relation to events that were later submitted to the Tribunal as part of the dispute.509\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 149; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 265.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 149.\n\n444.\n\nPursuant to Article 9(5) of the BIT, \"general principles of international law\" formed part of the law applicable to the dispute. Venezuela submits that under Article 9(5) the Tribunal was required to apply the doctrine of treaty abuse in international law to resolve the jurisdictional dispute at hand. However, although the Tribunal identified Article 9(5) of the BIT as the primary source of applicable law, it simply listed the law but failed to demonstrate its application. This is the Tribunal's failure to apply the law and constitute a manifest excess of powers.510\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 151, 152.\n\n445.\n\nVenezuela characterizes in five steps how, in its view, the Tribunal had manifestly failed to apply the international law on treaty abuse under Article 9(5) of the BIT:511\n\n\u2022 First step (paragraphs 268-270 of the 2013 Decision), the Tribunal oversimplified the Parties' positions on treaty abuse.\n\n\u2022 Second step (paragraphs 271-274 of the 2013 Decision), the Tribunal made broad statements regarding the standards adopted by other tribunals to conclude at paragraph 274 of the 2013 Decision that there was a \"growing body of decisions placing some limits on the investor's choice of corporate form, even if it complies with the relevant technical definition in the treaty.\"512\n\n\u2022 Third step (paragraphs 276 and 277 of the 2013 Decision), the Tribunal lists facts starting from 2004, without analysing them or relating them to the broad standards.\n\n\u2022 Fourth step (paragraphs 278-280 of the 2013 Decision), the Tribunal made three conclusory statements without linking them to the identified standard.\n\n\u2022 Fifth step (paragraph 281 of the 2013 Decision), the Tribunal decided that no treaty abuse had occurred.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 153-160.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00f9s]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 274.\n\n446.\n\nVenezuela explains that in its five-step approach, the Tribunal did not analyse or determine the rules through which any of the legal standards it identified took concrete form. The Tribunal failed to point to which (if any) of the principles it effectively applied to the present dispute and, thereby, it manifestly exceeded its powers.513 Venezuela refers to the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Kl\u00f6ckner* which annulled the subject award and held that reliance on a principle of law requires \"argumentation\" and \"touching on rules defining how this 'principle' is to be applied [\u2026] in general and in [a] particular case,\" rather than postulating the principle.514\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), 159; Reply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 268.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 269-271, citing *Kl\u00f6ckner Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.\n\n447.\n\nVenezuela argues that excess is manifest, and it suffices to read paragraphs 271 to 280 of the 2013 Decision to find the Tribunal's failure to identify the law it purportedly applied. Venezuela counters that Conoco is misrepresenting Venezuela's position that the Tribunal misapplied the law, but Venezuela's argument is that the Tribunal did not identify the law it purportedly applied515\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 273.\n\n*b) Manifest excess of powers for assuming jurisdiction over the claims of the Dutch companies CPH and CGP*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n448.\n\nThe Tribunal also exceeded its powers when it upheld jurisdiction over the ConocoPhillips Dutch companies, CPH and CGP. Conoco abusively included the Dutch companies in the chain of ownership of the projects in 2005-2006, when ConocoPhillips had foreseen the dispute. Venezuela refers to four facts that demonstrate that the 2005-2006 restructurings were abusive, made only to gain access to ICSID in anticipation of the dispute.516\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 163-165.\n\n449.\n\nVenezuela submits that to determine if the Tribunal exceeded its powers, the Committee must make an independent interpretation of the jurisdictional sources, the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Here, one factor limiting the Tribunal's jurisdictional powers was the treaty abuse doctrine, which the Tribunal acknowledged in the 2013 Decision. Venezuela refers to a number of ICSID awards to submit that at least four criteria should be considered to assess if there was treaty abuse: (i) the temporality of the restructuring; (ii) the motive for the restructuring; (iii) if the host State consent to the restructuring; and (iv) if the dispute was foreseeable at the time of the restructuring.517\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal failed to address the fact that the restructuring occurred after the investment was made, which was undisputed as reflected in paragraphs 276.a and 276.b of the 2013 Decision.518\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal did not address the motives admitted by ConocoPhillips Companies for the restructuring of the chain of ownership, namely, to gain access to ICSID. Instead, the Tribunal focused on the existence of a claim at the time of the restructuring, whereas the dispute was about the foreseeability of such a claim.519\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal did not address the issues of Venezuela never consented to the restructurings, or that Conoco only notified Venezuela of the restructuings after asserting asserted their rights under the BIT.520\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal ignored or overlooked facts of the underlying arbitration showing that ConocoPhillips Companies foresaw the dispute at the time of the restructurings:\n\no On 13 November 2001, before the restructurings, the Venezuelan Congress enacted the New Organic Law of Hydrocarbons, which provided that private companies were allowed to participate in oil projects in Venezuela only through mixed companies in which the State holds a majority stake (paragraph 188 of the 2013 Decision).521\n\no On 22 November 2004, before the restructurings, ConocoPhillips Companies asserted claims against Venezuela in relation to the increase of the applicable royalty rate in October 2004 (paragraphs 191, 201, 277.a of the 2013 Decision). ConocoPhillips characterized the increase as \"step one of the expropriation.\"522\n\no On 12 April 2005, before the restructurings, the Minister of Energy and Mines initiated the migration process concerning the Projects (paragraph 277.a of the 2013 Decision). This, Venezuela argues, means that the Tribunal acknowledged that on that date the process that gave rise to the dispute officially started. In turn, the 2001 New Organic Law of Hydrocarbons already hinted that the migration could result in an amicable migration or mandatory transfer to a mixed company.523\n\no The Tribunal acknowledged that there are \"limits on the investor's choice of the corporate form, even if it complies with the relevant technical definition in the treaty text,\" such as \"good faith\", \"d\u00e9tournement de pouvoir\", \"abuse of rights\", \"misuse of the system\", \"abuse of powers\" and \"equality of position\" (paragraph 274 of the 2013 Decision).524\n\no On 31 January 2007, the ConocoPhillips Companies notified Venezuela of the existence of a dispute under investment law, a dispute which they acknowledged had started to emerge in 2004, before the 2005/2006 restructurings.525\n\no Venezuela emphasized in the arbitration that in May 2005 (before the 2005-2006 restructurings), counsel for the ConocoPhillips Companies foresaw that the 2001 New Organic Law of Hydrocarbons, the 2004 royalty rate increase, and the migration of the projects towards mixed companies would likely give rise to a dispute that was *in fine* referred to arbitration. This was publicized in a pamphlet in May 2005.526\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 285-287.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 166.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 167.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 168.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 170; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 288.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 171, citing **A/R-164 [De Jes\u00fas] / A/R-183 [Curtis]**, *Claimants' Reply on the Merits*, \u00b6 336: \"[\u2026].

However, the Tribunal ignored these jurisdictional limits, thereby, manifestly exceeding its powers.527 Contrary to Conoco's submission, Venezuela maintains that it is not asking the Committee to make a de novo review, but rather to carefully review the applicable jurisdictional sources and make its own assessment of the factual background.528 Venezuela rejects Conoco's proposition that because under Convention Article 41(1) the tribunal's jurisdictional findings are conclusive, excess of powers are not annullable under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Venezuela submits this would prevent the Committee from performing the first step of the analysis to engage in an independent analysis of the legal and factual sources to determine the applicable limits to the tribunal's jurisdiction.529\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 294.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 296.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 299.\n\n451.\n\nVenezuela also counters Conoco's argument that as long as a tribunal's jurisdictional findings are tenable, there would be no excess of powers. Venezuela submits that the \"tenable test,\" entails a degree of review, thereby contradicting Conoco's position that the Committee cannot act as an appellate body. In any event, even applying the \"tenable test,\" Venezuela has shown that no reasonable observer would consider it tenable to rule that the dispute was not foreseeable at the time of 2005/2006 restructurings.530\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 300-303.\n\n452.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal ascertained its jurisdiction at odds with the facts it had acknowledged, the applicable jurisdictional sources and logic, and, thereby, manifestly exceeded its powers. This excess, Venezuela submits, warrants that the Committee \"annul the passages of the September 2013 Decision dealing with the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction over the ConocoPhillips Dutch Companies under Article 9 of the BIT [and]. *Par voie de cons\u00e9quence*, [\u2026] annul, in their entirety, the Interim Decision and the Award.

Venezuela recounts that first, from paragraphs 216 to 218 of the 2013 Decision the Tribunal summarized the Parties' positions on treaty abuse (even though the Parties had devoted over 40 paragraphs to that issue). Second and third, the Tribunal included a catalogue of principles used by other tribunals on the issue of treaty abuse and broadly concludes at paragraph 274 of the 2013 Decision that the catalogue supports the limits placed on investors' choice of corporate form. Venezuela criticizes that despite this catalogue, the Tribunal failed to \"explain the legal meaning, scope, application or relevance to the instant case of any of those standards, or even the rules allowing any of them to take concrete form.\"532\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 202; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 328.\n\n455.\n\nVenezuela identifies the conclusion at paragraph 274 as \"Point A\" of the Tribunal's reasoning and paragraphs 276 to 281 (a chronology of facts) as \"Point B\". At paragraph 275, Venezuela notes that the Tribunal made the \"hollow announcement\" that it would examine the facts against the standards in the catalogue, yet it failed to do so.533\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 203-205.\n\n456.\n\nThen, at paragraphs 278 to280 the Tribunal made three observations:\n\na. At paragraph 278 the Tribunal stated that the restructuring \"did not attempt to transfer any right or claim arising under ICSID or a BIT from one owner to another. Indeed, at the time of the transfers, ConocoPhillips had withdrawn its only claim of breach.\" The Tribunal's observation at paragraph 278 has no connection to the catalogued standards. The Tribunal failed to explain how the observation at paragraph 278 may be reconciled with the fact that CPH had asserted claims before the Tribunal regarding measures that occurred before its incorporation. The Tribunal ignored the argument posited by Conoco Parties that the expropriation occurred from 2004, *i.e.*, before the restructuring. Finally, it failed to address the issue of foreseeability of the dispute, which was Venezuela's position.534\n\nb. At paragraph 279 the Tribunal stated that \"the only business purpose of the restructuring, as acknowledged by the Claimants' principal witness on this matter, was to be able to have access to ICSID proceedings. But [\u2026] no claim had been made at the time of the restructuring [\u2026].\" Here, Venezuela argues that the Tribunal again failed to address the issue of the foreseeability of the dispute. Other tribunals in the absence of any business purpose view with scepticism a corporate restructuring; yet the Tribunal failed to address that point too. The Tribunal also ignored key facts, related to the foreseeability of the claim. The Tribunal did not consider the fact that the Ministry of Hydrocarbons had announced to the ConocoPhillips companies that if the migration under the 2011 New Organic Hydrocarbons Law failed, Venezuela would exercise its sovereign powers over its resources. Even the Conoco Parties themselves considered that the expropriation process had started as early as 2004.535\n\nc. At paragraph 280 the Tribunal considered as a \"major factor\" that the Conoco Parties invested approximately USD 434 million after their decision to restructure. The Tribunal viewed this as indicative of the Conoco Parties wishing to carry out the projects and that proceedings under the BIT were not in prospect at that time. Venezuela submits that the Tribunal failed to explain why this factor would entail an absence of treaty abuse.536\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 207-209.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 213-215.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 216, 217.\n\n457.\n\nVenezuela argues that Conoco takes an unduly restrictive approach towards Article 52(1)(e) when it argues that the Committee has no powers to review the reasoning nor to annul the Award, unless the Award is entirely unreasoned. Venezuela clarifies that its position is not that the Tribunal should have dealt with every argument raised by the Party, that for reasoning to pass the sufficiency test of Convention Article 52(1)(e), the Tribunal must have expressly addressed the arguments that might have an impact on the reasoning, failing which a reader of the 2013 Decision simply cannot understand the Tribunal's reasoning.537 Further, the Tribunal's reasoning was inadequate, by merely finding that Conoco's \"evidence it found most persuasive\" when it ignored the fact of Conoco's abuse of the corporate structure to secure treaty protection when a dispute was foreseeable.538 Venezuela emphasizes that the Tribunal also failed to indicate how the Freshfields May 2005 pamphlet was irrelevant to their assessment on the issue of treaty abuse.539\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 329, 330.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 331, citing Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 760.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 333.\n\n458.\n\nIn light of the above, Venezuela requests the Committee to annul the 2013 Decision dealing with jurisdiction over the Dutch companies, and *par voie de consequence* the Interim Decision and the Award in accordance with Convention Article 52(1)(e).\n\n**B.1(3) No Manifest Excess of Powers and No Failure to State Reasons (Conoco Parties)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***N****o** **M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers** **(C****onoco****)***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) No manifest excess of powers in the Tribunal's findings on treaty abuse*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nConoco argues that Venezuela is retrying two jurisdictional arguments that the Tribunal unanimously rejected in its 2013 Decision. The Tribunal rejected Venezuela's arguments (i) that the Claimants abused their corporate form and restructured their investments solely to gain access to ICSID arbitration under the BIT; and (ii) that the BIT did not cover *indirect* investments of CPH and CGP in the Hamaca and Corocoro Project.\n\n460.\n\nConoco recounts the facts related to the restructurings of its investments in Venezuela between July 2005 and September 2006, all of which occurred before the expropriation.540\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 736, 737.\n\n461.\n\nAccording to Conoco, in August 2006 Venezuela sent the proposed terms of the migration of the Association Agreements to mixed companies, and at that point the Claimants did not know that the migration would result in the expropriation. It is Conoco's position that only in January 2007 when Venezuela announced the nationalization program that culminated with the taking of Claimants' investments, Conoco then notified Venezuela of the existence of the dispute. Subsequently on 1 May 2007, Venezuela seized physical control of the projects, and on 26 June 2007, it \"formally expropriated Claimants' interests [\u2026] when the negotiation period to reach an agreement on the proposed migration expired.\"541\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 737.\n\n462.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder on Annulment, Conoco describes how the Tribunal reasoned in its 2013 Decision on the issue of treaty abuse:542\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal identified Article 9 of the BIT as the applicable law;\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal went through the Parties' arguments. The Parties disagreed on whether, at the time of the restructurings, the dispute was foreseeable. Venezuela's position was that the dispute was foreseeable, with Conoco having admitted to restructuring its investments to gain the BIT's protection. The Claimants argued that, at the time of the restructuring, no dispute had arisen or was foreseeable, and nothing prohibits corporations from altering their investment structure to benefit from treaty protections.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal turned to Article 1 of the BIT's jurisdictional requirements and cases referenced by the Parties on treaty abuse. The Tribunal recognized that \"a growing body of decisions\" support the existing limits to the investor's choice of corporate form, even if it complies with the treaty's definition.\n\n\u2022 Then, the Tribunal assessed if the Claimants had abused their corporate form when they brought their BIT claim. The Tribunal looked at the timeline of the restructurings, including a chronology of regulatory changes that took place between 2004 and 2007.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal found no treaty abuse, because (i) the restructurings in 2005 and 2006 did to transfer any right or claim under the BIT or the ICSID Convention from one owner to another; and (ii) no claim was made and \"none was in prospect\"543 at the time of the restructurings, even if the Claimants had admitted that their motivation for restricting was to gain BIT protection. The Tribunal referred to Conoco documented expectation that the Projects would continue, having made continued expenditure on the Projects. The Tribunal characterized that continued expenditure as \"a very weighty factor in its decision [\u2026].\"544\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 738(a)-(g); Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 302.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 738(f), citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the* Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 278\u201379.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 738(g), **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 280.\n\n463.\n\nConoco argues that Venezuela simply disagrees with the Tribunal's factual and legal conclusions on treaty abuse.

Partial non-application or an erroneous application of the law does not constitute grounds for annulment.\n\n465.\n\nConoco also counters Venezuela's argument that the Tribunal failed to apply the law because its legal analysis was not elaborate,546 noting that tribunals are not obliged to spell out the connection between each legal principle it identified, nor the conclusion drawn from it.547\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 742, referring to Memorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 152, 159.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 752.\n\n466.\n\nVenezuela, Conoco maintains, is asking the Committee to review *de novo* the Tribunal's findings on fact and law regarding the treaty abuse issue, which exceeds the scope of annulment review. In the jurisdictional context, an excess of powers must be manifest, obvious on its face and evident from a simple reading of the award, not susceptible to more than one interpretation or tenable so that it can be supported by reasonable arguments.548\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 744, 750.\n\n467.\n\nConoco refers to the decisions of the committee in *Azurix*, in that the issue of jurisdiction \"[\u2026] falls to be resolved definitely by the tribunal in exercise of its power under Article 41 before the award is given, rather than by an *ad hoc* committee under Article 51(1)(b) after the award has been given.\"549\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 745, citing *Azurix Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 68.\n\n468.\n\nConoco refers to the decision of the committee in *Mobil*, which rejected Venezuela's request to annul the award for manifest excess of powers alleging that the claimant's 2005 restructurings amounted to treaty abuse. The *Mobil* committee found that it \"ha[d] no legitimate power to control the [t]ribunal's specific findings [on jurisdiction] [\u2026] either the legal theory [\u2026] applied in order to distinguish between legitimate corporate planning and abuse of right, or the application of that theory to the particular circumstances of the case.\"550\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 747, citing **A/RLA-74** [De Jes\u00fas], *Venezuela Holdings B.V. and others v.

Algeria* (rejecting manifest excess of powers in declining jurisdiction, concluding that if the committee involves itself in assessing whether the evidence the tribunal gathered justified a finding of abuse of rights, this would transform the committee into an appellate body)551 and in *Alapli v. Turkey* (committees are not empowered to review the tribunal's appreciation of the law and determination of relevant facts).552\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 748, citing *Orascom Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 317.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 749, citing **A/RLA-151 [Curtis]**, *Alapli Elektrik B.V. v.

It is not the Committee's role to review the Tribunal's factual findings against the record or the parties' arguments. For an inquiry under Article 52(1)(b), it is irrelevant whether the Committee agrees with the Tribunal's conclusions on fact, law, or the Tribunal's appreciation of the evidence.553\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 752.\n\n471.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco reiterates that Venezuela is asking the Committee to make a *de novo* review of the Tribunal's decisions on jurisdiction, noting that even if there was a mere error (there is not), it would not meet the annulment standard of Convention Article 52(1)(b). Venezuela would have to show that the Tribunal's decision was one that no reasonable person could accept. Despite Venezuela's contention to the contrary, is it not the Committee's role to perform a thorough and independent review of the evidence, the Parties' arguments, or the Tribunal's conclusions. The Committee can only assess whether the decision constitutes an excess of powers that is so obvious on its face as to allow no debate among reasonable persons.554\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 300, 301.\n\n***N****o** **F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons** **(C****onoco****)***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n472.\n\nConoco submits that the Tribunal's reasons for upholding jurisdiction were clear and not contradictory. The Tribunal's reasons can be followed from A to B.555 The Tribunal's finding of no abuse of right was permissible, because no dispute had commenced and \"none was in prospect at the time of the restructurings,\" even though the acknowledged business purpose of the restructuring was to access the treaty protections for Dutch investors.556\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 303.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 756, citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6\u00b6 279\u201380.\n\n473.\n\nContrary to what Venezuela maintains, the Claimants did not admit in the arbitration that the dispute was foreseeable. The issue of the foreseeability of the dispute was key in the arbitration. The Tribunal simply found Venezuela's arguments on that issue unconvincing and Venezuela is not entitled to reopen those findings.557\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 757.\n\n474.\n\nThere is also no contradiction in the Tribunal's finding that there was no dispute at the time of the restructuring, while also acknowledging that ConocoPhillips had previously withdrawn. Conoco explains that the Parties agreed during the arbitration that the standard for treaty abuse demanded that the specific dispute put before the Tribunal existed or was foreseeable at the time of the restructuring. In its 2013 Decision, the Tribunal noted that in January 2005 ConocoPhillips withdrew its objection to the increased royalty rates approved by Venezuela in October 2004 \"in the clearest of terms.\" That objection was separate and apart from the specific dispute resolved by the Tribunal relating to the 2007 expropriation.558\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 758, citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 278.\n\n475.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons regarding its treatment of Venezuela's arguments on foreseeability. First, as the Orascom committee stated, tribunals are not required to deal with every detail of every argument made by a party.559 Second, contrary to Venezuela's assertion, the Tribunal considered the treaty abuse allegation and found that there was no abuse since at the time of the restructuring \"no claim had been made\" and \"none was in prospect\".560 Third, the Tribunal need not provide reasons for its reasons, and Venezuela's allegation that the Tribunal failed to explain why it considered the continued investment in the Projects as a major factor fails. In any event, the answer is obvious, namely, that no reasonable investor will continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollars long-term if it expects an imminent taking of its investment.561\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), 759, citing *Orascom Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 319.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 760, citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 279.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 769.\n\n476.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco argues that Venezuela attempts, without any support, to reinterpret Article 52(1)(e) to suggest that the Tribunal must at least have addressed any arguments that could impact its reasoning.

The Applicant contends that these companies were corporations of convenience formed for the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID arbitration under the Treaty. In the Applicant's view, by upholding jurisdiction over the ConocoPhillips Parties under the dispute settlement provisions of Article 9 of the Treaty, the Arbitral Tribunal gave effect to Claimants' strategy and condoned treaty abuse, thereby, manifestly exceeding its powers.563\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 762-769.\n\n478.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal discussed the ICSID awards in *Aucoven v. Venezuela*, *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine*, *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia*, *Phoenix v.

The Applicant proposes a chronology of events starting on 10 October 2014 (with Venezuela's announcement of the royalty increase) which the Tribunal did not accept as sufficiently supporting its contention that the Conoco Parties' expropriation claim was within the reasonable contemplation of the investor at the time of the restructuring.569 The Tribunal considered that at the time of the restructuring, \"ConocoPhillips had withdrawn its only claim of breach and had done that in the clearest of terms.\"570 The Tribunal then continued: \"[i]t was not until May 2006 that the first of the actions which were later to be the subject of the letters from ConocoPhillips notifying the Venezuelan government of a dispute, was taken.\"571 The Committee's mission under Article 52(1)(b) is to check the validity of the Award as it was decided by the Arbitral Tribunal. Whether the Arbitral Tribunal's conclusions on the expropriation claim actually \"*defies credulity*\"572 is an invitation to the Committee to make its own appraisal based on the chain of events presented by the Applicant in its submissions on annulment. It is not within the Committee's remit to reach its own conclusion on jurisdiction on the basis of facts reargued by the Applicant in the annulment proceeding and, in case the Committee would find, as invited by Venezuela, that the expropriation claim was reasonably foreseeable for the investors, conclude that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers.573 If such were our mission, the word \"manifest\" would only depict the discrepancy between the Committee's own reassessment of the facts in light of the foreseeability test and the assessment made by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 789.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 278.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 278.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 790.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 423: \"On that issue, it is difficult to understand how the Tribunal could avoid the conclusion that the restructuring was a classic example of treaty abuse. The Tribunal did not deal with the material facts set forth in the table in paragraph 789 of the Memorial, which were not in dispute. One cannot look at that table and come to the conclusion that the migration process initiated by Decree-Law 5.200 was not foreseeable.\"\n\n481.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Arbitral Tribunal applied a wrong test. It ignored the foreseeability test which it earlier acknowledged as germane to treaty abuse and applied instead the test for jurisdiction *ratione temporis*.574 The impugned passages (paragraphs 278-279) of the 2013 Decision which follow the Arbitral Tribunal's recapitulation of the significant events from 10 October 2004 to 26 June 2007, read:\n\n\"*Against that chronology and bearing in mind the matters weighed by other tribunals considering objections to jurisdiction made on the basis of 'treaty abuse', this Tribunal makes a number of observations. The first is that the transfers of ownership in 2005 and 2006 did not attempt to transfer any right or claim arising under ICSID or a BIT from one owner to another. Indeed, at the time of the transfers, ConocoPhillips had withdrawn its only claim of breach and had done that in the clearest of terms. It was not until May 2006 that the first of the actions, which were later to be the subject of the letters from ConocoPhillips notifying the Venezuelan government of a dispute, was taken. The Tribunal later considers the significance of the date of that measure and of 29 August 2006 for the CPH claim.*\n\n*It is the case, to turn to a second matter, that the only business purpose of the restructuring, as acknowledged by the Claimants' principal witness on this matter, was to be able to have access to ICSID proceedings. But as against that, as already noted, no claim had been made at the time of the restructuring and, subject to the qualification made in respect of the claims by CPH about the two measures taken in 2006, none was in prospect at the times of the restructurings*.\"575\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 433, 434, 436.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6\u00b6 278-279.\n\n482.\n\nThe Committee considers that the Arbitral Tribunal was not testing temporal jurisdiction in relation to various critical dates such as when the dispute arose, when the investment was made, or the date of the alleged breach. As stated in paragraph 278 of the 2013 Decision,576 the Tribunal examined the temporal jurisdiction regarding the CPH claim based on the increase in income tax in respect of the dates of the alleged breach and of the acquisition of ownership interest by CPH.577 By claiming that the Arbitral Tribunal should have addressed foreseeability of the income tax claim and the migration process for the associations578 the Applicant tries to substitute its own assessment of the circumstances of the foreseeability of the dispute to that of the Tribunal, without demonstrating an excess of powers.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 278 (\"*The Tribunal later considers the significance of the date of that measure and of 29 August 2006 for the CPH claim*.\")\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6\u00b6 287-289.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 436.\n\n483.\n\nThe Applicant last alleges579 that the fact that the Tribunal attached importance to the ConocoPhillips Parties' continued expenditure on the Projects after the restructurings, which the Tribunal singled out as a \"*major factor*\", does not mean that ConocoPhillips did not foresee disputes coming. The Tribunal took the opposite view by considering ConocoPhillips' continued investment in the project as telling evidence against any finding of treaty abuse.580 The Applicant's challenge is an invitation to review the application of the foreseeability test undertaken by the Tribunal against the chronology of events adopted in the 2013 Decision in consideration of \"*the matters weighed by other tribunals considering objections to jurisdiction made on the basis of 'treaty abuse'*.\"581 The Tribunal's findings of fact are final and immune from review unless there has been a breach of rules of natural justice in the fact-finding process in the arbitration, which is not contended here. The wrongful application of the treaty abuse test argument overlaps with Venezuela's attack on treaty abuse for failure to state reasons which the Committee now examines.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 437, 438.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 280.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 278.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nThe requirement of reasons in ICSID Convention Article 48(3) enables an *ad hoc* committee to review the award under Article 52(1)(e) as a safeguard against arbitrariness. As stressed by the *Wena ad hoc* committee, the purpose of Article 52(1)(e) is not to have the award reversed on its merits, it is to allow the parties to understand the arbitrators' decision.582\n\n*Wena Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 83.\n\n485.\n\nThe Applicant contends that, due to a lack of cogent explanations, the Tribunal's conclusion on the absence of treaty abuse does not align with the facts found in the 2013 Decision, the admissions made by the Conoco Parties, or the legal principles relied upon. The Applicant also argues that the Tribunal failed to address the foreseeability of the expropriation claim, asserting that jurisdiction cannot be exercised by virtue of a restructuring into a treaty country when the claim is foreseeable.583\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 791-793.\n\n486.\n\nThe Committee finds that the reasons the Tribunal used to compare the chronology of the ConocoPhillips Companies restructuring with the significant events between October 2004 and June 2007 - and to infer that no claim had been made and none was in prospect at the time of the restructurings- are clear and not contradictory. Furthermore, they are sufficient to explain the conclusion reached by the Arbitral Tribunal on the absence of treaty abuse, without conflating this with jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, which concerns the temporal scope of f treaty protection. At paragraphs 278 and 279 of the 2013 Decision, the Tribunal assessed the facts to determine whether the specific dispute put before it already existed or was foreseeable at the time of the restructuring. The Tribunal viewed ConocoPhillips's January 2005 withdrawal of the claim in relation to the 2004 increased royalty rates as a separate dispute, distinguishing from the specific dispute brought before the Tribunal concerning expropriation. This follows from the statement that \"[i]t was not until May 2006 that the first of the actions, **which were later to be the subject of the letters from ConocoPhillips notifying the Venezuelan government of a dispute**, was taken\" (emphasis added).584\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 278.\n\n487.\n\nOn the alleged failure to address the foreseeability of the expropriation claim, the Committee first notes that tribunals are not required to deal with every argument made. However, the Committee considers that this Tribunal addressed the argument. At paragraph 279 of the 2013 Decision, the Tribunal weighed the fact that \"no claim had been made at the time of the restructuring and [\u2026] none was in prospect at the times of the restructurings\" against the admitted fact that the restructuring's only business purpose was ICSID access.585 The Committee's view is that the Tribunal gave sufficient reasons which enable a reasonable reader to understand that the Decision on Jurisdiction was not guided by arbitrariness.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 279.\n\n**B.1(4)(2) The Committee's Analysis of Manifest Excess of Powers and Failure to State Reasons as Argued by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Regarding the failure to apply the law.*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nWith regard to the allegation of treaty abuse by the Dutch companies, the Applicant remarks that the Arbitral Tribunal considered the general principles of international law mentioned at Article 9(5) of the BIT on the law applicable to the dispute as constituting the primary source of law. Yet, it is impossible in the Applicant's view, to detect the actual law, if any, which the Arbitral Tribunal applied to resolve the jurisdictional objection.586 To support its contention, the Applicant alleges that the Arbitral Tribunal oversimplified the Parties' position on Treaty abuse at paragraphs 268-270 (first step) before making a broad presentation of the standards adopted by other tribunals to conclude that the treaty abuse doctrine forms part of the applicable international law at paragraphs 271-274 (second step). The Arbitral Tribunal immediately listed the facts at paragraphs 276 and 277 without measuring them against the above broad standards (third step). The Arbitral Tribunal next made three conclusory statements at paragraphs 278-280 without linking them to the standard that it had previously identified (fourth step). Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal decided at paragraph 281 that no treaty abuse had occurred (fifth step). In undertaking this five-step approach, the Arbitral Tribunal failed to analyse or determine the rules through which any of the six broad standards it mentioned take concrete form and the way they operate remained wholly unexplored. In fact, the Arbitral Tribunal failed to point to which (if any) of those principles it effectively applied to the present dispute.587\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 150-152, 160; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 272.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 159.\n\n489.\n\nSince the first prong of the treaty abuse challenge rests on failure to apply the proper law, it is important for the Committee to first clarify that *how* a tribunal applies the applicable law is not a matter falling under Article 52(1)(b), which does not allow an appeal on the substantive correctness of the award. It is noteworthy that, the Arbitral Tribunal considered at paragraphs 271-274 the investor-State case decisions and other decisions of international organs discussed by the Parties before drawing the consequences for treaty abuse of the standards identified in these decisions, such as \"*good faith*,*\" \"d\u00e9tournement de pouvoir*,*\" \"abuse of treaty right*,\" *\"misuse of the system of international investment protection*,\" \"*abuse of powers*,\" and \"*equality of position*.\"588\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 273.\n\n490.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal also recalled the chronology of the incorporation of the Conoco Dutch companies in 2005-2006 and the chronology of the significant measures adopted by the Venezuelan public powers throughout the years 2004-2007 (at paragraphs 276 and 277). The Tribunal concluded at paragraph 279 that \"*no claim had been made at the time of the restructuring and, subject to the qualification made in respect of the claims by CPH about the two measures taken in 2006, none was in prospect at the times of the restructurings.*\" It supported its dismissal of the jurisdictional objection by referencing ConocoPhillips' continued investment in the project after the restructuring, which it considered at paragraph 280 as evidence \"*telling strongly against any finding of treaty abuse*.\" The Applicant indeed alleges that the Tribunal \"*erred*\" in deciding that although the ConocoPhillips companies had withdrawn their reserve regarding some claims prior to the restructurings, the dispute was not foreseeable at the time in 2005-2006.589 In essence, the Applicant takes issue with the Tribunal's \"*close examination*\"590 of all the circumstances of the case in relation to the identified legal standards on treaty abuse. It challenges the application of the proper law to the facts as the Arbitral Tribunal found them, which is wholly distinct from a failure to apply the proper law within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b).\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 277.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jesus]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 275.\n\n*b) Regarding the jurisdiction assumed over the claims of the Dutch companies CPH and CGP*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nThe Applicant's second prong of its challenge on treaty abuse is based on usurpation of powers. Reminiscent of its submissions in the arbitration,591 the Applicant says that the facts acknowledged by the Arbitral Tribunal at paragraphs 188, 191, 201 and 277.a of the 2013 Decision support the conclusion that the ConocoPhillips companies considered the dispute to have emerged as early as in 2004 and that they asserted claims in relation to this dispute well before the restructurings.592 The Applicant acknowledges that the Arbitral Tribunal noted at paragraph 277.a of the 2013 Decision withdrawal of the protest regarding the royalty tax increase on 14 January 2005. Notwithstanding the Tribunal's finding that no claim existed or was in prospect at the times of the restructurings,593 the Applicant urges the Committee to consider the withdrawal of a reservation of rights as only affecting one's rights to assert claims in relation to a controversy but not as erasing the factual situation having given rise to the claim which, the Applicant submits, made the dispute foreseeable.594 In its view, by acknowledging that the Minister of Energy initiated on 12 April 2005 the migration process (which had been hinted at in the 2001 New Organic Law Hydrocarbons), the Tribunal necessarily acknowledged that on 12 April 2005 the process giving rise to the dispute referred to arbitration, *i.e.*, an unsuccessful migration process, had started.595 The Applicant further invites the Committee to interpret ConocoPhillips' notification on 31 January 2007 regarding the existence of a dispute under the Investment Law and the Treaty demonstrating that the ConocoPhillips Parties themselves considered the dispute to had already emerged in 2004.596\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 165-169.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 170-177.

Arbitration Rule 34(1) provides that the arbitral tribunal is the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value. Evaluation of the evidence, thus, falls within the province of the arbitral tribunal.597\n\n**A/CLA-63**, *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v.

A manifest excess of power inquiry focuses on the award motives and dispositive sections which come under the committee's scrutiny, rather than on the underlying dispute, as doing so would turn annulment into an appeal of fact and law. Any *de novo* review of the case on jurisdiction or on the merits is excluded. The Applicant confused the contours of Article 52 through its invocation of a \"*reasonable observer*\" to assess an arbitrator's bias, to review the entire file, particularly a May 2005 Freshfields pamphlet, to prove that the measures implemented in the oil and gas sector since 2001 could give rise to a dispute.599 The Committee finds that the Applicant wishes for the Committee to substitute the Applicant's views on the existence of a dispute prior to the incorporation of the Dutch companies for those of the Arbitral Tribunal, without demonstrating an excess of powers. This is impermissible and as such, the Committee needs not address whether the alleged excess was manifest.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 140, 144.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 291, *see also* \u00b6\u00b6 294, 303.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n494.\n\nThe Applicant declares that it is impossible to understand with the reasons provided in paragraphs 276-280 of the 2013 Decision which motivated the Arbitral Tribunal's rejection of the jurisdictional challenge concerning the Dutch companies.\n\n495.\n\nThe Applicant would have liked to read in the 2013 Decision why the Arbitral Tribunal did not share the scepticism of other arbitral tribunals regarding the restructuring chain of ownership in the absence of any business purpose.600 It would also like to know why the Tribunal drew its legal findings without assessing whether the Conoco Parties, who considered that the expropriation process began in 2004, were not anticipating the prospect of a dispute in circumstances where the Ministry of Hydrocarbons had officially announced months before the restructuring that the migration process envisaged by the 2001 New Organic Law had been initiated for the Conoco projects and that, unless the migration was successful, Venezuela would exercise its sovereign powers over its resources.601 It would have liked to see explanations as to why the \"*major factor*\" of Conoco' continued investment entailed an absence of treaty abuse.602\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 213.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 215.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 216.\n\n496.\n\nThe Committee recalls, as accepted by other *ad hoc* committees, that while the arbitral tribunal's reasoning may be terse and the reasons succinctly expressed,603 the Convention does not prescribe for the way in which the reasons are to be expressed in the award. Provided that the parties understand the reasoning,604 its persuasiveness escapes review. The Applicant's challenge raises considerations that belong to an appeal procedure and are inadmissible in an annulment review. To illustrate the point, we find that the Applicant's remark605 - the Arbitral Tribunal's allegedly isolated finding that the restructurings \"*did not attempt to transfer any right or claim arising under ICSID or a BIT from one owner to another*\" from the \"*circumstances of the case*\" at paragraph 278- disregards paragraph 275 where the Tribunal expressly sated that the \"*circumstances of the case*\" would be examined to determine the existence of treat abuse. The Applicant's remark serves as a direct invitation for the Committee to re-evaluate the consequences attributed by the Arbitral Tribunal to the factual chronology at paragraphs 276-277, particularly, the Arbitral Tribunal's inference that there was neither an actual nor a prospective dispute at the times of the restructurings, based on the fact that ConocoPhillips Companies withdrew their October 2004 protest regarding the royalty tax increase on 14 January 2005.606\n\n**A/CLA-95 / A/RLA-189 [Curtis]**, *Churchill Mining Plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v.

The reasoning of the above paragraphs enables the reader to understand the Tribunal's motives. The ConocoPhillips Companies protested in November 2004 against the royalty tax increase announced but withdrew their protest in January 2005, before the restructuring process began. The inescapable conclusion is that at that time no claim existed. As the *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena* clarified, \"*reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision*.\"611\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 278.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 209.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 289: \"*While the income tax increase was enacted before CPH was inserted into the chain of ownership in the following month, September 2006, the increase did not come into effect until 1 January 2007.

In principle, the Tribunal considers that a breach of obligation does not occur until the law in issue is actually applied in breach of that obligation and that cannot happen before the law in question is in force.

The Applicant raises the letter of ConocoPhillips Latin America President regarding the occurrence of the expropriation process which came out in 2004.615 The dispute notification letter of 31 January 2007 has a subtitle reading \"*Beginning In 2004, The Venezuelan Government Adopted A Series Of Measures That Severely Impaired ConocoPhillips' Investments In Venezuela And Frustrated Its Legitimate Expectations In Respect Of These Investments*.\" The only 2004 event which is mentioned is the October 2004 increase of the royalty payment followed by the indication that \"*ConocoPhillips agreed to waive its right to contest this action in January 2005 in good faith* [\u2026]\"616 That event was also mentioned by the Tribunal in its chronology of events at paragraph 277.a and the omission of the letter itself could not affect the Tribunal's reasoning. The Tribunal inferred from Conoco's waiver the inexistence of any dispute at the times of the restructurings: \"*Indeed, at the time of transfers, ConocoPhillips had withdrawn its only claim of breach and had done that in the clearest terms.*\"617 In the same vein, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to explain how the May 2005 Freshfield pamphlet was not relevant in assessing whether the dispute described in that document was foreseeable following the release of the brochure \"*Venezuela: Proposed Measures Against Oil and Gas Investors*.\"618 It was incumbent upon Venezuela to bring to the Tribunal's attention the allegedly decisive nature of the Freshfield's four pages communication leaflet619 in relation to Conoco's decision to restructure its investment to circumvent the Treaty's jurisdictional clause. It is not the Committee's task to determine the relevance of the evidence produced in the arbitration as that would turn the Committee into an appellate body.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 210. **A/C-69** (previously **C-36),** *Mr. Lyons letter* (footnote 217).\n\n**A/C-69** (previously **C-36),** *Mr. Lyons letter*.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 278.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 333.\n\n**R-14**, *Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Venezuela: Proposed Measures Against Oil And Gas Investors* (May 2005).\n\n500.\n\nThe Applicant denounces the imbalance between paragraphs 216, 217 and 218 which recapitulate the Parties' respective positions on jurisdiction over the Dutch companies and the forty paragraphs in the Parties' submissions dedicated to this jurisdictional objection. The Applicant alleges this imbalance as an indication that the Arbitral Tribunal preferred to follow its preconceived view and infers that the Majority's \"*conclusory postulations make evident a lack of legal reasons*.\"620 The Applicant further alleges a lack of connection between the Tribunal's jurisdictional finding and the catalogued standards at paragraphs 272 and 273 for detection of treaty abuse identified in ICSID and other international cases. Although the Tribunal recognized the limits on the investor's choice of corporate form at paragraph 274, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to make further reference to any of the standards. Instead, it only presented a chronology of events, followed by three observations: firstly, at paragraph 278, that the restructurings \"*did not attempt to transfer any right or claim arising under ICSID or a BIT from one owner to another*;\" secondly, at paragraph 279, the absence of business purpose was irrelevant because \"*no claim had been made at the time of the restructurings*\" and \"*none was in prospect*;\" thirdly, at paragraph 280, the \"*major factor*\" consisting of Conoco's wish to continue carrying out the projects entails an absence of treaty abuse.621 The Applicant considers that the reader's inability to follow the reasoning results from the Tribunal's failure to explain the meaning of the \"*good faith*,\" \"*d\u00e9tournement de pouvoirs*,\" \"*abuse of treaty rights*,\" \"*misuse of the system*,\" \"*abuse of powers*,\" and \"*equality of position*,\" standards, making it impossible to understand why these standards were considered relevant or whether they were applied at all in the Tribunal's reasoning.622\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 200.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 203-204.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 202 ; Reply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 328.\n\n501.\n\nThe Committee's reading is that the Tribunal first recounted at paragraphs 272-273 the decisions which recognized the concepts in relation to the misuse of law. It then added at paragraph 274 the equality of position between the parties as an additional factor to determine whether the doctrine of abuse should be invoked in the actions of a corporate body like the Conoco companies. The Tribunal then declared at paragraph 275:\n\n\"*Whether those limits have been breached must turn on a close examination of all of the circumstances of the case, circumstances to which the parties in this arbitration have given particular attention. The Tribunal now turns to that examination. It will do that bearing in mind how rarely courts and tribunals have held that a good faith or other related standard is breached. The standard is a high one.*\"623\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 275.\n\n502.\n\nVenezuela argues that at this juncture such close examination was not performed by the Arbitral Tribunal,624 an argument this Committee has earlier dispelled given it constitutes an attempt to re-evaluate the Tribunal's judgment on evidence. The Arbitral Tribunal summarized the Parties' respective contentions, referred to the relevant legal principles and applied the relevant legal authorities. The Tribunal's reasoning on the absence of treaty abuse begins in paragraph 275 and reads without difficulty: the circumstances of the restructuring and the events which preceded the submission of the Request for Arbitration are detailed at paragraphs 276-277, and are contextualised with the legal principles of treaty abuse. This ultimately enables the Tribunal to conclude at paragaphs 278-279 that no claim existed or was in prospect at the time of the restructurings.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 205.\n\n503.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the existence of Conoco's substantial investment *after* the restructuring further demonstrates that Conoco's intention was not to abuse the ICSID Process. As the ConocoPhillips Parties remark,625 an investor would have disengaged if a contentious situation had existed. Having drawn the limits of an investor's choice of corporate form and found that in the present case, these had not been exceeded, the Arbitral Tribunal explained to the Parties how and why it rejected Venezuela's jurisdictional objection considering the facts of the case and the applicable law on treaty abuse.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 761.\n\n**B.2 Grounds Related to the Tribunal's Exercise of Jurisdiction over Indirect Investments**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**B.2(1) Manifest Excess of Powers and Failure to State Reasons in Relation to the Tribunal's Jurisdictional Findings on the Indirect Investments as Argued by Venezuela (Curtis)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers** **(C****urtis****)***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n504.\n\nVenezuela notes that the BIT does not cover indirect investments, as such the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when exercising jurisdiction over the indirect investments of CHP and CGP.\n\n505.\n\nThe BIT's Article 1(a) defined \"investment\" as \"every kind of asset\" and enumerates five categories within its scope. In its 2013 Decision, the Tribunal found that the BIT covered indirect investments because the BIT's definition of \"investment\" is written in broad terms and is \"clear beyond question.\" Venezuela argues that the breadth of the definition only goes to the type of assets covered, not how the assets are held. The logical interpretation of \"investment\" is that it covers assets of foreign nationals asserting a claim against a Contracting Party, not assets indirectly owned or controlled through subsidiaries of that national.626\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 798.\n\n506.\n\nThe Tribunal erroneously assumed that there was no difference between a treaty expressly covering \"direct or indirect\" investments, as many treaties do, and one that does not. However, when Venezuela and the Netherlands intended to grant treaty protection to indirect investments, they did so expressly in the relevant instrument. Other treaties they entered into explicitly refer to \"direct or indirect\" investments (for example, Venezuela's bilateral investment treaties with Canada, Paraguay, France and Belgium-Luxembourg, or the Netherlands's bilateral investment treaties with Hong Kong, Kuwait and Tunisia).627\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 797.\n\n507.\n\nVenezuela argues that the BIT's Contracting Parties were conscious of the need to incorporate the concept of indirectness when they wanted to depart from the normal meaning of terms used, but they did so only with respect to the term \"national\" in Article 1(b)(iii). Under that provision Dutch nationals can structure their investments through an entity owned or controlled by them even in other countries, but the entity bringing the claim must still be the direct owner of the investment.628\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 798; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 444.\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal ignored the distinction between investment treaties expressly covering direct or indirect investments and those, such as the BIT, that do not, thereby, violating the principle \"*verba aliquid operari debent*\" as a canon of treaty interpretation. The Tribunal's interpretation was illogical, given the fact that the same countries negotiated other treaties expressly referring to \"indirect\" investments, and it could not have simply assumed that the same country intends the same result in other treaties which omit such specific language.629Venezuela then refers to scholars who have recognized the significance of the presence or absence of language expressly incorporating the concept of indirect investment.630\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 800; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 447.\n\nSee Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6 801.\n\n509.\n\nVenezuela also asserts that the Tribunal failed to deal with the issue that the BIT establishes that the obligations of a Contracting Party run to nationals of the other Contracting Party only with respect to their investments located in the territory of the first Contracting Party. Venezuela refers to the BIT's recitals, to Articles 2, 4 and 7, all of which, refer to investments made in the territory of the other Contracting Party. This, Venezuela submits, indicates that the BIT protects entities having an investment in Venezuela, and not their various parent companies holding interests in entities in other countries.631\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 803.\n\n510.\n\nVenezuela argues that by considering that the Treaty was to be interpreted as if the words \"directly or indirectly\" were included in Article 1(a), the Tribunal rewrote the BIT to expand its scope.632\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 805.\n\n511.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal wrongly relied on *Fedax v. Venezuela*, stating that it supported the \"plain meaning\" of Article 1 of the Treaty advocated by the Conoco Parties when the comment of the Fedax tribunal was related to the issue whether the type of asset constituted an investment, whereas here the issue is whether the purported investor owned the investment at issue.633\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 806; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 448.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons** **(C****urtis****)***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n512.\n\nVenezuela argues that the reasoning of the Tribunal with respect to the protection of indirect investments under the BIT cannot be followed \"from point A. to point B.\" Venezuela asserts that the Tribunal concluded, without any analysis, that \"the words of the definition [of Article 1] are clear beyond question\" and there was \"no need to interpret\" the provision. It offered no explanation why absent the words \"directly or indirectly,\" Article 1 also afforded protection to indirect investments, when the literal and logical interpretation of the term \"investment\" is that it only covers assets owned directly by persons falling within the definition of the term \"nationals.\" In that exercise, the Tribunal did not meaningfully take into consideration Venezuela's and the Netherlands' treaty practice.634\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 809, citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 285; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 449.\n\n513.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal failed to address Venezuela's argument that the BIT's broad definition of \"investment\" was merely relevant to the rights or assets afforded protection, but not to the way such rights or assets are held (*i.e.*, directly or indirectly). This was a fundamental point omitted by the Tribunal, which constitutes a failure to state reasons within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, an additional ground to annul the Award with respect to the claims of CPH and CGP.635\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 810; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 449.\n\n**B.2(2) Manifest Excess of Powers and Failure to State Reasons in Relation to the Tribunal's Jurisdictional Findings on the Indirect Investments as argued by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers** **(D****e** **J****es\u00fas****)***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n514.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when (a) it failed to apply the applicable law and (b) usurped powers it did not have over the direct investments.636\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 308.\n\n*a) Regarding the failure to apply the law*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n515.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal failed to perform any form of interpretation of the BIT's relevant terms when it found that the BIT covered *indirect* investments by CPH and CGP in the Hamaca and Corocoro Projects.\n\n516.\n\nVenezuela notes that the indirect nature of the investments was undisputed. Also, each Party made submissions on the interpretation of the relevant terms of the BIT under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties (\"**VLCT**\"), which, Venezuela submits, was the applicable law for the interpretation of the BIT. Yet, the Tribunal failed to apply the VCLT, or any other law, to address Venezuela's jurisdictional objection regarding the indirect nature of the investments of CPG and CGP.637\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 184-187; Reply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 309, 310.\n\n517.\n\nVenezuela submits that in its 2013 Decision, the Tribunal based its findings concerning CPH and CGP's indirect investments relying exclusively on \"the words of Vattel,\"638 which were not submitted by the Parties into the record, and which do not constitute \"principles of international law,\" applicable to resolve the dispute under Article 9(5) of the BIT.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 188, citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jesus]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 285.\n\n518.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela counters that the \"tenability\" test proposed by Conoco is misplaced. The relevant question is not if other tribunals, applying other rules of law to other facts have also considered indirect investments as qualifying for protection under the applicable instrument. The issue is whether the Tribunal applied the applicable law to resolve the jurisdictional issue in the arbitration. Venezuela emphasizes that its position is not that the Tribunal misapplied the applicable law to the issue of jurisdiction, but that it failed to apply the applicable law at all. Also, Conoco's argument that the Tribunal identified that BIT Articles 1 and 9 should apply to the jurisdiction challenge fails, since applying the law requires more than just pointing to the law. Finally, Venezuela submits that Conoco's defense that the Tribunal applied the VCLT by referring to *Fedax* is misplaced. In *Fedax*, although the tribunal mentioned the VCLT to discuss the meaning of \"investment\" under ICSID Convention Article 25, the term \"investment\" was purportedly construed by the tribunal under Article I of the relevant Treaty.639\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 311-316.\n\n*b) Regarding the usurpation of powers*\n---------------------------------------\n\n519.\n\nVenezuela also argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it concluded that the BIT covered indirect investments of CPH and CGP. Venezuela's position was that (a) the BIT only covered investments \"located in the territory\" of Venezuela. In this regard, Venezuela pointed to the BIT's preamble, and Articles 2, 4 and 7; and (b) the BIT's exclusion of indirect investments was consistent with the BIT's own purpose and object, since \"no substantive benefit is achieved by permitting companies to utilize layers of holding companies to manufacture multiple claimants making duplicative claims for alleged treaty violations.\"640\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 191, citing **A/R-49 [De Jesus] / A/R-8 [Curtis]**, Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, 1 February 2010, (\"*Respondent's Rejoinder*\"), \u00b6 140; Reply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 320.\n\n520.\n\nOn the issue of the BIT not covering indirect investments, Venezuela \"incorporate[d] by reference\" the submissions from its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction (paragraphs 172-181).641For example, among those arguments, Venezuela submitted that although the term \"investment\" in Article 1(a) of the BIT was broad and encompasses \"every kind of asset,\" unlike other treaties executed by Venezuela and the Netherlands, it did not cover assets owned or controlled \"directly or indirectly\" by a national of the other Contracting Party. Venezuela explained that the omission was meaningful considering that Venezuela's treaties with Canada, Paraguay, France, and Belgium-Luxembourg, all of which explicitly cover investments in Venezuela held *indirectly* by a national of those countries.642\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 192, referring to **A/R-47] / A/R-6 [Curtis]**, Respondent's Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, 1 December 2008, (\"*Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction*\"), \u00b6\u00b6 172-181.\n\n**A/R-47 [De Jesus] / A/R-6 [Curtis]**, *Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction*, \u00b6 174.\n\n521.\n\nVenezuela maintains that the Tribunal completely failed to engage with its arguments and to apply the BIT's definition of investment, to the extent that there is no reasoning at all on the issue.643 Venezuela counters Conoco in that it is not asking the Committee to make a *de novo* review, which as explained *supra* (paragraph 457) it is a restrictive position on the Committee's power to review the Tribunal's findings.644\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 192; Reply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 321\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 322, 323.\n\n522.\n\nTherefore, Venezuela asks that the Committee annul the passages of the 2013 Decision dealing with CPH and CGP's indirect investments and the claims related to the same pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. *Par voie de cons\u00e9quence,* it requests that the Committee also annul the passages of the Interim Decision and the Award dealing with claims related to CPH and CGP's indirect investments.645\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 194.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons** **(D****e** **J****es\u00fas****)***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n523.\n\nThe Tribunal did not provide any reason to the interpretation of the BIT. It dealt with the matter in five paragraphs (282-286) in the 2013 Decision, and did not address Venezuela's objection on the issue of indirect investments of CPH and CGP. Venezuela's objection was based on the interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the terms of the BIT in the context and in light of the BIT's object and purpose in accordance with the VCLT.646\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 219; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 336.\n\n524.\n\nThe Tribunal only made a conclusory statement that \"for the Tribunal the words of the definition are clear beyond question\" which falls short of satisfying the Tribunal's obligation to provide reasons under Convention Article 43(1).647This, Venezuela argues, warrants an annulment of the 2013 Decision of the portion dealing with CPH's and CGP's indirect investments and the portions dealing with their indirect investments in the Interim Decision and the Award.648\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 220; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 336.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 222.\n\n525.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela counters that Conoco Parties tries to construct reasons to attribute to the Arbitral Tribunal by suggesting that the Tribunal's reference to *Fedax* was sufficient since in that case the tribunal undertook the interpretation that was required from the Tribunal.649 Venezuela submits that Convention Article 52(1)(e) requires that a statement of reasons must have some substance to enable parties' comprehension; mere references to other cases, without any form of argumentation do not amount to stating reasons. On this point, Venezuela refers to the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Kl\u00f6ckner650* and the dissenting opinion to the majority award issued in *Watkins v.

In the arbitration, the Tribunal rejected Venezuela's jurisdictional objection that the BIT did not offer protection to *indirect* investments, like those of CPH and CGP, since Article 1 of the treaty omitted any reference to *indirect* investments, unlike other treaties concluded by Venezuela and the Netherlands. For Venezuela argues that by extending the BIT's protection to indirect investments, the Tribunal disregards the BIT's ordinary meaning, considering its object and purpose.652\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 765.\n\n527.\n\nConoco explains that both CPH and CGP were indirect investors in the Hamaca and Corocoro Projects. CPH held 57% of shares in Hamaca Holding LLC, which in turn was the sole shareholder of Phillips Petroleum Company Venezuela Ltd., which in turn held 40% interest in the Hamaca Project. CGP was since August 2005 the sole shareholder of Conoco Venezuela C.A., which in turn held 32.2075% interest in the Corocoro Project.653\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 764.\n\n528.\n\nConoco describes the Tribunal's analysis of Venezuela's argument. The Tribunal started by noting that treaty drafting practice varies, and went on to consider Venezuela's argument that some Dutch treaties covered indirect investments, yet noted that the model Dutch treaty contained language identical to Article 1 of the BIT. The Tribunal considered *Fedax v. Venezuela* as the case \"directly on point\" and supported the Claimants' position of the plain meaning of Article 1 (\"every kind of asset\"). For the Tribunal, the language used in the definition of investment in Article 1 of the BIT was clearly written in broad terms and beyond question, and that there was no need to interpret when such a need did not exist.654\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 766, referring to and citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6\u00b6 284, 285.\n\n529.\n\nConoco argues that Venezuela is retrying its case on jurisdiction, and that Venezuela's allegations that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law and sufficiently address Venezuela's arguments are meritless. Conoco adds that Venezuela's request to incorporate its submissions on jurisdiction from the arbitration is improper and impermissible in annulment proceedings.655\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 769.\n\n530.\n\nIn Conoco's view, the Tribunal identified the Treaty as the law applying to jurisdictional objection, in particular, BIT's Articles 1 and 9. Then, the Tribunal interpreted the term \"investment \" of Article 1 in accordance with the plain meaning of the words of Article 1, and agreed with Claimants' argument and the reasoning of the *Fedax* tribunal that the broad term \"every kind of asset\" covers every kind of asset, including indirect investments.\n\n531.\n\nOn the interpretation under the VCLT, Conoco submits that even if Venezuela's allegation (that the Tribunal failed to apply the VCLT to interpret Article 1 of the BIT) was true, it would not amount to an annullable ground; it would be at most an error made when interpreting and applying the applicable law, *i.e.*, the BIT.656\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 771.\n\n532.\n\nConoco's position is that the Tribunal's reference to the decision of the *Fedax* tribunal shows that the Tribunal did not ignore the VCLT, accepted the reasoning of the *Fedax* tribunal and applied that reasoning to the case: the *Fedax* tribunal interpreted the same treaty language in accordance with the VCLT and in light of treaty practice in the Netherlands and in Venezuela. In this regard, Conoco relies on the decision of the committee in Impregilo that [\u2026] \"[s]tating that [the tribunal] has no ground to disagree with decisions in another case means that the [t]ribunal accepted the reasoning in those decisions and applied that to the specific case submitted to it.\"657\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6772, citing *Impregilo Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 201.\n\n533.\n\nConoco asserts that Venezuela's real complaint is that the Tribunal did not cite the VCLT; yet the Tribunal's reasoning was faithful to the VCLT, since it interpreted the BIT in accordance with the ordinary meaning given to its terms, consistent with Article 31(1) VCLT.658\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 773.\n\n534.\n\nAlso, Venezuela's objection that the Tribunal erred in assuming there is no difference between a treaty that covers \"direct or indirect\" investment and one that does not, is an objection that has no place in annulment. In any event, as long as the Tribunal's decision is tenable and reasonable arguments can be made, the decision must stand.659\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 775.\n\n535.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco reiterates that Venezuela is rearguing its case on jurisdiction, which has no place in annulment. At most, Venezuela has alleged an error in the interpretation or application of law, which cannot lead to annulment. Also, Venezuela's contention that the Tribunal ignored certain of its arguments is irrelevant. The Tribunal considered the Parties' thoroughly and found Venezuela's arguments unconvincing.660\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 306, 307.\n\n***N****o** **F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons** **(C****onoco****)***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n536.\n\nVenezuela (De Jes\u00fas) asserts that the Tribunal provided no reasons to its decision on the meaning of the term \"investment;\" while Venezuela (Curtis) accepts that there were reasons but asserts that those were unclear. Conoco submits that Venezuela's real claim is neither that the Tribunal failed to state reasons, nor that those were unintelligible, but rather that the Tribunal adopted the wrong reasons, which is not a basis for annulment.661\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 777; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 308.\n\n537.\n\nThe Tribunal provided reasons for finding that the BIT protected indirect investments, interpreting the BIT's definition of \"investments\" in line with treaty practice and in accordance with the plain meaning of the words in the Treaty. The Tribunal also referenced the case law cited by the parties, and relied on a decision it found relevant, which in turn concluded that the same BIT protected indirect investments on the basis of (i) the plain meaning of the definition of \"investment;\" (ii) the VCLT; (iii) the treaty practice of both the Netherlands and Venezuela; and (iv) the World Bank guidelines on foreign investment.662\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 778; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 308.\n\n538.\n\nAs for the sufficiency of that reasoning, the issue before the Tribunal was whether Article 1 of BIT, which was silent on the point, covered indirect investments. The Tribunal provided reasons for concluding that it did and among other reasons given, the Tribunal relied on *Fedax*, which in turn recognized \"that every time the Republic of Venezuela has wished to exclude [from investment treaties] investments that are not manifestly direct, it has done so in unequivocal terms.\"663 In its Rejoinder, Conoco notes that Venezuela (Curtis) takes issue with the Tribunal's reliance on *Fedax*, which at most is an (incorrect) allegation of error in application of the law. And while Venezuela's (De Jes\u00fas) critiques that the Tribunal's reference to *Fedax* lacks any substance, the Tribunal provided reasons which are intelligible and can be followed.664\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 779, citing **A/CLA-40**, *Fedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997, (\"*Fedax Decision on Jurisdiction*\"), \u00b6 36.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 309.\n\n539.\n\nConoco also submits that, contrary to Venezuela's allegation, the Tribunal did note both Venezuela's view on treaty practice and its argument as to the relevance of treaties containing express provisions on indirect investments. But the Tribunal was not persuaded by these arguments; that is not a ground for annulment.665Similarly, Conoco counters that Venezuela may disagree with the Tribunal's reference to the Dutch model treaty on the issue of indirect investments, but disagreeing with the reasons is not a failure to state reasons.666\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 780.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 310.\n\n540.\n\nConoco also counters Venezuela's argument that the Tribunal failed to address the argument that Article 1's breadth is relevant only to the type of rights or assets that could constitute an investment, and not the way (directly or indirectly) they were held, explaining that the Tribunal is not required to explicitly address all points raised by the parties. The fact that the Tribunal was not convinced by Venezuela's arguments is not a reason to annul the decision.667\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 781.\n\n541.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal provided reasons for its findings on the issue of indirect investment and those reasons are sufficient to discharge the Tribunal's limited duty under Convention Article 48(3) to provide reasons. Venezuela has not demonstrated that the Tribunal failed to state reasons, and its request for annulment should be dismissed.668\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 782.\n\n**B.2(4) The Committee's Analysis of the Grounds Related to the Exercise of Jurisdiction Regarding Indirect Investments: Manifest Excess of Powers and Failure to State Reasons**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**B.2(4)(1) The Committee's Analysis of Manifest Excess of Powers and Failure to State Reasons as Argued by Venezuela (Curtis)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n542.\n\nVenezuela disputes that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by exercising its jurisdiction over the indirect interests of CPH and CGP in the Hamaca and Corocoro Projects, despite the Treaty not covering indirect investments. The Applicant remarks that, unlike other treaties entered by Venezuela and the Netherlands, the definition at Article 1(a) of the Treaty does not refer to direct or indirect investment ownership or control. However, the Arbitral Tribunal did not analyse the effect of these different formulations or the treaty practice of both Venezuela and the Netherlands, nor did it take into account the principle \"*verba aliquid operari debent*\" as a canon of interpretation. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore rewrote the Treaty to expand its scope.669\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 804, 805.\n\n543.\n\nHere lies the answer of the Arbitral Tribunal on the indirect investments of CPH and CGP:\n\n\"*The Tribunal remarks in respect of treaty practice that this demonstrates that there is no single way of drafting definitions. Different formulations may have precisely the same effect. Drafting practice varies. While, as the Respondent notes, some of the Dutch bilateral investment treaties use a different formula, its model bilateral investment treaty, along with very many others, uses exactly the wording to be found in the treaty with Venezuela. The one case which is directly in point \u2014 Fedax \u2014 also supports the Claimants' 'plain meaning'.*\n\n*For the Tribunal the words of the definition are clear beyond question. They are written in broad terms, as indeed the Respondent accepts. In the words of Vattel, there is no need to interpret that which has no need of interpretation.*\n\n*Accordingly, this objection to jurisdiction in respect of the claims of CPH and CGP fails*.\"670\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6\u00b6 284-286.\n\n544.\n\nThe application of interpretative rules was not in issue as the Arbitral Tribunal found that there was no need for interpretation of Article 1: \"*In the words of Vattel, there is no need to interpret that which has no need of interpretation.*\" Venezuela's contention is that the Arbitral Tribunal, quite to the contrary, should have engaged in an interpretative exercise of the Treaty scope. The underlying idea of Vattel's general maxim may be understood as holding interpretation a secondary process which only comes into play when it is impossible to make sense of the plain meaning of the treaty. As the Tribunal accepted the \"*plain meaning*\" of Article 1 of the Treaty which defines investment \"*as every kind of assets*,\" it rejected Venezuela's interpretation in support of the exclusion of indirect investments without committing an excess of powers.\n\n545.\n\nThe Applicant also takes issue with the Tribunal's use of the *Fedax v. Venezuela* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction as addressing limits on the type of the assets which is not the issue here.671 This criticism alludes to an error of law which is not reviewable and does not amount to a manifest excess of powers.\n\n*Fedax Decision on Jurisdiction*, \u00b6 32. \"*This definition* [of investment at Article 1(a)] *evidences that the Contracting parties to the* [Kingdom of the Netherlands and Republic of Venezuela] *Agreement intended a very broad meaning for the term 'investment'*\". Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6 806; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 448.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n546.\n\nThe Committee's conclusion on manifest excess of powers also entails the rejection of the Applicant's argument that the Arbitral Tribunal's determination with respect to Article 1(a) lacks reasons.\n\n547.\n\nAbsent any necessity to interpret the Treaty, the Arbitral Tribunal had no obligation to explain beyond an iteration of the Treaty's terms why indirect investments could be protected by the Treaty. As remarked by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Hydro v. Albania*,672 there is no need for tribunals to express reasons for reasons. The Treaty words which define a protected investment as every kind of investment without distinction constitute *ipse dixit* the Tribunal's reasoning of the inclusion of indirect investments. This answers the Applicant's concerns that the Tribunal did not explain why indirect investments could be protected in the absence of the words \"directly or indirectly,\" given that the Applicant believes that a logical interpretation of the term \"investment\" only covers assets directly owned by nationals.673\n\n**A/CLA-114**, *Hydro S.r.l. and others v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/28, Decision on Annulment, 2 April 2021, (\"*Hydro Annulment Decision*\"), \u00b6 126.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 809.\n\n548.\n\nAn arbitral tribunal has no obligation to address all points raised by the parties,674 especially where, as here, where the conclusion by the Arbitral Tribunal on the broadest definition of \"investment\" in the Treaty rendered unnecessary Venezuela's argument that the broad definition pertains to only the rights or assets that are afforded protection, not as to the manner in which such rights or assets are held.675\n\n*Rumeli Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 84; *MCI Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 67.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 809-810.\n\n**B.2(4)(2) The Committee's Analysis of Manifest Excess of Powers and Failure to State Reasons as Argued by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n549.\n\nThe Committee comes now to Venezuela' second jurisdictional challenge concerning the indirect investments of CPH and CGP. The Applicant challenges at first the Tribunal's refusal to perform any interpretation of the Treaty relevant terms, postulating instead that such interpretation was not necessary because the terms were clear. According to the Applicant, this constituted a manifest excess of powers by failure to apply any law because the Tribunal was required to construe the terms of the treaty in accordance with the rules of interpretation embedded in the VCLT which qualify as general principles of law in the terms of Article 9(5) of the Treaty.676\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 185-187; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 309-310.\n\n550.\n\nThe Committee finds beyond contestation that the Tribunal's decision was not omission or neglect but a conscious choice not to engage in an interpretative exercise beyond the plain terms of the Treaty. The Arbitral Tribunal's 2013 Decision explains \"*there is no need to interpret that which has no need of interpretation*.\"677\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 285.\n\n551.\n\nArticle 9(5) of the Treaty is a choice of law clause which includes \"*the general principles of international law*\" in conjunction with the Treaty.678 The VCLT reflects international customary law which was confused by the Applicant with the general principles of international law. It is not the Committee's task to rewrite the challenge, but we may observe that the Tribunal applied the Treaty's clear and precise terms, specifically Article 1(a) of the Treaty which reads \"*the term 'investments' shall comprise every kind of asset*.\" A literal interpretation following which every kind of asset means direct and indirect investments in the absence of precision is a plausible explanation of what the Tribunal has reached. This is not how Venezuela understood as the ordinary meaning of the Treaty words. However, neither the failure of the Tribunal to follow the Applicant's proposed approach, nor the Applicant's claim of an inappropriate reference at paragraph 284 to the *Fedax* award679 constitute an egregious misapplication of the applicable law or a non-application of any law, as Venezuela would suggest.680\n\nArticle 9(5) reads: \"*5. The arbitral award shall be based on:*  \n*- the law of the Contracting Party concerned;*  \n*- the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant Agreements between the Contacting Parties;*  \n*- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments;*  \n*- the general principles of international law; and*  \n*- such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties to the dispute.*\"\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 316.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 313.\n\n552.\n\nVenezuela next grounds the challenge on the Tribunal's refusal to engage with its arguments in the arbitration on the exclusion of indirect investments. It pleaded in the arbitration that only investments located in the territory of Venezuela are covered by the Treaty and that exclusion of indirect investments is consistent with the purpose and object of the Treaty because \"*no substantive benefit is achieved by permitting companies to utilize layers of holding companies to manufacture multiple claimants making duplicative claims for alleged treaty violations*.\"681 In support of its demonstration, the Applicant \"*incorporates by reference its previous submissions on this specific issue*\".682 However, submissions made by the Applicant during the arbitration proceeding cannot be re-submitted to the Committee as if it were an appeal board.683 By presenting before the Committee the arguments that were unsuccessful in the arbitration, the Applicant's criticisms are indeed an indirect attack against the reasons of the Decision, which forms the basis for Venezuela's next ground for annulment. According to Venezuela, the \"*mere reading*\" of the paragraphs on the indirect investments demonstrate that a usurpation of powers684 occurred.\n\n**A/R-49 [De Jes\u00fas] / A/R-8 [Curtis]**, *Respondent's Rejoinder*, \u00b6 140 cited in Memorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 191.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 192.\n\nSee Counter-Memorial (Conoco) \u00b6 769.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 321.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe Applicant finally denounces the brevity of the reasoning which rejects Venezuela's jurisdictional objection over CPH and CGP's indirect investments as a failure to provide any reasons on the interpretation of the Treaty and failure to explain the conclusory statement that \"[f]*or the Tribunal the words of the definition are clear beyond question*.\"685\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 219-220.\n\n554.\n\nThe Committee considers that the Tribunal did not deem necessary to interpret because the definition of investment was clear under the Treaty. Parties are entitled to be informed why they have won or lost, but arbitrators are not required to express reasons for their reasons.686 There was no obligation to go beyond an iteration of the Treaty terms of \"*every kind of investment*\" in the definition of a protected investment. The Tribunal provided at paragraphs 284-285 reasons regarding the inclusion of indirect investments which are accessible to reasonably intelligent people. Having noted that the Dutch model BIT uses the same terms as the Dutch-Venezuela Treaty despite different formulations in Dutch drafting practices, and having emphasized that Venezuela consistently uses unequivocal terms to exclude indirect investments,687 the Tribunal dismissed the jurisdictional objection on the grounds that Article 1 of the Treaty does not make any express distinction between direct and indirect investments. The Tribunal decision is therefore easily understood.\n\n*Hydro Annulment Decision,* \u00b6 126.\n\n*Fedax Decision on Jurisdiction*, \u00b6 36.\n\n**C. GROUNDS RELATED TO THE TRIBUNAL'S FINDINGS IN RESPECT OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE TREATY: MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS; SERIOUS DEPARTURE; AND FAILURE TO STATE REASONS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**C.1. The Parties' Positions on the Tribunal's Findings under Article 6 of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n555.\n\nIn its 2013 Decision, the Tribunal Majority concluded that Venezuela \"[\u2026] breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT, and that the date of the valuation is the date of the Award.\"688 Venezuela, unsuccessfully, requested three times that the Tribunal reconsider the 2013 Decision.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 401.\n\n556.\n\nOn 17 January 2017, a reconstituted Tribunal issued its Interim Decision, where it rejected Venezuela's third request for reconsideration and clarified what it considered to be the \"true meaning of the 2013 Decision.\"689 The Tribunal stated that \"[b]ased on the above analysis of the 2013 Decision, the conclusion is that the Tribunal did not find a lack of good faith on the part of the Respondent for its breach of an obligation to negotiate on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT. The Tribunal stated simply that the Respondent failed to be involved in negotiations leading to an offer complying with the requirements of 'just compensation' and 'market value.'\"690 The Tribunal thus declared that \"[\u2026] Venezuela has breached Article 6 of the BIT by unlawfully expropriating the Claimants' investments in the three Projects in the Orinoco Belt in Venezuela.\"691\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44** **[De Jes\u00fas]**, Interim Decision, 17 January 2017, (\"*Interim Decision*\"), \u00b6\u00b6 39-66.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 60.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 156(3).\n\n557.\n\nVenezuela (Curtis and De Jes\u00fas) submits, that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b)) and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)) by finding that Venezuela had failed to negotiate in good faith; also, it failed to state the reasons for its findings (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n558.\n\nThe Committee summarizes the Parties' arguments on the grounds invoked. Each section starts with the arguments advanced by Venezuela (Curtis) (**C.1(1)**); then Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) (**C.1(2)**) and finally, the Conoco Parties (**C.1(3)**). The Committee's analysis of the grounds invoked in relation to the Tribunal's findings in respect of Article 6 of the BIT is addressed in **C.1(4)(1)** (Curtis) and **C.1(4)(2)** (De Jes\u00fas).\n\n**C.1(1) The Tribunal's Findings under Article 6 of the Treaty as Argued by Venezuela (Curtis)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nVenezuela (Curtis) argues that the Tribunal Majority manifestly exceeded its powers when (i) it found that Venezuela had failed to negotiate in good faith and that, thereby, the expropriation was unlawful; (ii) it disregarded the BIT's provisions and any customary international law principles applicable for the valuation date; and (iii) it disregarded the Parties' agreement on the applicable legal principles on the valuation date.\n\n560.\n\nFor Venezuela, the finding that the expropriation was unlawful for failure to negotiate in good faith for compensation, results from a failure to apply the applicable law. Venezuela refers, among others, to the dissenting opinions of Prof. Abi-Saab and arbitrator Bucher. Both arbitrators considered that the Conoco Parties never had advanced the issue of good faith negotiations.692\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 590.\n\n561.\n\nOnce the Tribunal unanimously held that the expropriation was carried out in accordance with due process of law and did not violate undertakings to the Conoco Parties, the Majority's finding of illegality in the expropriation had no basis. The only missing element in the expropriation was compensation, and yet (i) Venezuela always acknowledged that the Conoco Parties were entitled to compensation; (ii) Venezuela made substantial compensation offers; and (iii) it is accepted that a disagreement over the compensation does not render an expropriation unlawful.693Therefore, the argument that the expropriation was unlawful due to failure to agree on the compensation cannot be taken seriously, and the Tribunal's decision on this point is tantamount to a manifest excess of powers due to failure to apply the applicable law.694\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 591, 594.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 595.\n\n562.\n\nVenezuela submits, contrary to Conoco's position, that it is not asking the Committee to review the Award like an appeal.695 Also, Venezuela counters Conoco's argument, submitting that an egregious error of law can amount to failure to apply the law. Venezuela refers to the annulment decision in *Mobil*, which focused on the failure of the tribunal to consider the compensation provisions of the Cerro Negro project. Venezuela notes that while it may be true that different tribunals assessing different facts may come to different conclusions, the Mobil case is practically identical to the present case.696\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 271.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 273-275.\n\n563.\n\nThe Tribunal Majority also manifestly exceeded its powers by fixing the date of the Award as the valuation date and, thereby, disregarding the applicable law on the issue of the valuation date. The Tribunal disregarded Article 6(c) of the BIT, which provides that the valuation date should be determined as of a time immediately prior to the expropriation. It also disregarded Article 9(3), which limits the Tribunal's jurisdiction to awarding anything other than damages for a breach of the BIT.697\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 597; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 279.\n\n564.\n\nThe Tribunal disregarded Article 9(3) because designating the date of the Award as the valuation date, rather than the date of the expropriation, led to an excess of compensation for the alleged treaty breach. Such decision had no basis in the BIT or in any customary international law. Even if customary international law applied, the Tribunal had failed to apply the applicable principle of customary international law. Under *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* where the only wrongful act is the failure to pay compensation and the expropriation is lawful in other respects, the date of dispossession serves as the valuation date.698 Conoco submits that Article 9(3) does not prevent a tribunal from awarding other damages, such as those under customary international law. However, as Venezuela submits, nothing in customary international law (including the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case), or any other law allows a tribunal to award double, triple, or quadruple or more damages beyond the principal amount due.699\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 600- 603; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 278.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 279.\n\n565.\n\nThe Tribunal recognized *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* as setting forth the applicable principles of customary international law and the Conoco Parties relied on that case for the purposes of the valuation date. Both parties cited many cases showing that the damage caused by failure to pay compensation is awarding interest from the date of expropriation to the date of payment of the compensation. Yet, the Tribunal failed to cite a single case involving an expropriation where the only wrongful act was the failure to pay compensation, and the valuation date was moved.700\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 603-607.\n\n566.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal Majority and later the reconstituted Tribunal exceeded their powers by disregarding the Parties' agreement reached in the 2010 Hearing on the legal difference between expropriation unlawful *per se* and unlawful *sub modo* (*i.e.*, only for failure to pay compensation). In a case of expropriation *sub modo*, compensation must be measured as of the date of expropriation, with interest due until the date of payment.701 In its Reply, Venezuela submits that Conoco tries to limit the scope of the Tribunal's discussion to situations of expropriations unlawful *per se* and the \"full reparation\" standard of *Chorz\u00f3w Factory*; yet the Tribunal's discussion in the Award is not so limited. According to Venezuela, the Tribunal adopted a market value concept when compensation is not paid on the date of expropriation, even if the expropriation was lawful, without specifying any authority supporting its position.702\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 609.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 285.\n\n567.\n\nVenezuela notes that the Conoco Parties argued throughout the first phase of the case that the expropriation was unlawful *per se* and the valuation date should be moved to the date of the Award. But they never contested that if they were wrong on that point, then the valuation date should not be moved. After the 2010 Hearing, the Tribunal found the expropriation lawful in all respects other than payment of compensation (*i.e.*, *sub modo*). Nevertheless, the Majority in 2013 and the subsequently reconstituted Tribunal ignored, without warning, the Parties' agreement on the basis for calculating compensation and, exceeding its powers, obliterated the distinction between expropriation unlawful *per se* and *sub modo*.703\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 610-615.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n568.\n\nVenezuela (Curtis) argues that the Tribunal Majority had no basis to state in the operative part of the 2013 Decision that \"the Respondent breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation for its taking of the ConocoPhillips assets in the three projects on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT.\"704 Venezuela refers to the dissenting opinion of Prof. Abi-Saab, who characterized that as an \"utter decision by surprise.\"705 Venezuela argues, contrary to Conoco, that the issue is not if the Tribunal Majority stated reasons for their decision that the parties must engage in good faith negotiations; the issue is how the Tribunal came to that conclusion -for which the Tribunal provided no rational explanation.706\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 411, 491.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 617, citing **A/R-4 [Curtis] / A/R-45 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion*, \u00b6 282.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 293.\n\n569.\n\nFurther, the finding of failure to negotiate in good faith was the sole basis for determining that the date of valuation should be the date of the Award (rather than the date of expropriation).707Venezuela submits that after the finding of the 2013 Decision, the Conoco Parties proceeded to argue bad faith negotiation, while Venezuela countered with three requests for reconsideration and during the 2016 hearings.708\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 617.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 618.\n\n570.\n\nVenezuela argues that there is contemporaneous evidence that Venezuela negotiated in good faith based on fair market value and refers to the witness testimony of Mr. Goff and to the information the Conoco Parties' negotiators conveyed to the U.S. Embassy in Caracas. Yet, the reconstituted Tribunal in the 2017 Interim Decision decided -against the clear terms of the 2013 Decision- that the 2013 Decision did not find a lack of good faith, failing to explain why it had allowed the Parties to litigate for over three years based on a presumed misunderstanding. In Venezuela's view the \"clarification\" of the issue of good faith negotiation in the 2017 Interim Decision was an improper attempt to salvage the fundamentally flawed 2013 Decision, which the Tribunal refused to reconsider.709\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 619-622\n\n571.\n\nImportantly, if, as the 2017 Interim Decision ruled, there was no lack of good faith negotiation, it follows, according to the unanimous view of the Tribunal in 2013, that the expropriation was not illegal, and the valuation date must be the date of the expropriation. It is therefore impossible to follow the Tribunal's reasoning from the 2013 Majority to the 2017 Interim Decision and the Award, which warrants annulment within the meaning of Convention Article 52(1)(e).\n\n572.\n\nFurther, Venezuela argues that the rulings of the reconstituted Tribunal on the illegality of the expropriation and valuation date are incomprehensible. Those rulings were based on the finding that Venezuela made no compensation offers or that those were inadequate, not based on market valuation. Yet, Venezuela refers to undisputed facts on the record pointing to the contrary, including: the U.S. Embassy cables showing that Venezuela was negotiating fair market value; the Executive Vice President for Exploration and Production of ConocoPhillips announcing at an investors' conference that Venezuela was negotiating on the basis of fair market value; and testimony from Venezuela's and the Conoco Parties' witnesses that Venezuela was negotiating fair market value. It is therefore impossible to understand how the reconstituted Tribunal concluded that Venezuela failed to negotiate on the basis of fair market value principle.710\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 628-630; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 296, 306.\n\n573.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal failed to state sufficient reasons for moving the valuation date. Even if Venezuela had not negotiated fair market value and even if it had not made compensation offers, the valuation date should have remained to be the expropriation date.711\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 633.\n\n574.\n\nArticle 6(c) of the BIT mandates that valuation in the case of expropriation be done as within a time immediately prior to the expropriation. Even if customary international law is applied instead of the BIT's valuation date, as held by the Tribunal, in accordance with the *Chroz\u00f3w Factory* principle, the valuation date still remains as the date of dispossession, unless the expropriation is unlawful *per se*.712The Parties and the Tribunal relied on *Chorz\u00f3w Factory*; however, without any colorable reasons, the Tribunal moved the valuation date forward to the Award's date, resulting in a huge increase in the amount of the Award.713The Tribunal overlooked that when failure to compensate is the only wrongful act and the expropriation is not unlawful *per se*, the valuation date remains unchanged.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 634; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 292.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 635, 636.\n\n575.\n\nFor Venezuela it is impossible to follow the Tribunal's reasoning from its acknowledgement of *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* principle to the conclusion that the valuation date should be moved, which warrants annulment pursuant to Convention Article 52(1)(e) for failure to state reasons.\n\n576.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela submits, among others, that Conoco merely answers that the Committee cannot reassess evidence nor substitute findings for those of the Tribunal, nor evaluate the correctness or adequacy of the reasoning. But Venezuela's position is that the Tribunal may not make decisions and render Awards totally disconnected from facts and contradicted by the record. In this vein, Venezuela refers, among other facts of the record,714 to Conocos' own 2007 valuations whose combined value of USD 5.855 billion, Venezuela submits, were not that far from Venezuela's offer of USD 4 billion recorded in Conoco's Request for Arbitration. There is thus no rational explanation for a finding that Venezuela failed to negotiate on a fair market value basis. Venezuela also argues that Conoco fails to deal with the indicia of fair market value, including their valuations, and simply recites the Tribunal's statements of the 2017 Interim Decision, which Venezuela labels as \"incomprehensible.\"715\n\nSee Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 306.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 303-306, 309.\n\n***S****erious** **D****eparture from a** **F****undamental** **R****ule of** **P****rocedure***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n577.\n\nVenezuela (Curtis) submits that the reconstituted Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by ordering the Parties to produce documents covered by their Confidentiality Agreement.716\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 638.\n\n578.\n\nThe protection of settlement privilege is a fundamental rule of procedure, the more so if the parties have entered into a confidentiality agreement to expressly preserve confidentiality as with the present case. Venezuela refers to scholarly articles on the subject, proposing that a tribunal's failure to respect settlement privilege can be a ground for setting aside an award.717 Venezuela refers to orders by arbitral tribunals in investment arbitrations that documents covered by settlement privilege should be shield from document production.718 Venezuela also relies on the committee's decision in *Libananco v. Turkey*, in which, Venezuela submits, the committee fully endorsed the tribunal's decision to exclude from evidence all privileged documents.719\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 640.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 641, 642, citing **A/RLA-137 [Curtis]**, *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v.

In Venezuela's view, the Tribunal's justification for its decision was frivolous, and the Tribunal misconstrued and relied on confidential documents for its 2017 Interim Decision. This conduct, Venezuela submits, was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure warranting annulment pursuant to Convention Article 52(1)(d).720\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 644.\n\n580.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela argues that it would set a dangerous precedent if ICSID tribunals could simply overlook settlement privilege and attorney-client privilege. Besides, the issue here is the Tribunal disregarded the Parties' express agreement prohibiting the production of documents exchanged in compensation negotiations. Further, Venezuela maintains that it was clear that Venezuela was negotiating compensation in good faith based on fair market value. As such, regarding the production of those documents, Venezuela's concern was that the Tribunal would be influenced by the amounts of compensation Venezuela offered to avoid litigation, causing the Tribunal to view that Conoco's interests in the Projects were greater than the compensation offered. The proposed monetary amounts of compensation, according to Venezuela, were based on assumptions that did not reflect the reality of the fields or other factors that bore upon fair market value.721\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 347, 348.\n\n581.\n\nAlso, contrary to Conoco's position, Venezuela argues that it did not waive its right to invoke settlement privilege by relying on the U.S. Embassy cables. The Confidentiality Agreement does not cease to exist because the Conoco Parties breached it by talking to the U.S. Embassy. The U.S. Embassy cables became public through no fault of Venezuela and Venezuela introduced the cables to show that the Conoco Parties had misrepresented Venezuela's position in the negotiations.722\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 350.\n\n**C.1(2) The Tribunal's Findings under Article 6 of the Treaty as Argued by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n582.\n\nVenezuela (De Jes\u00fas) argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (i) by deciding *ultra petita* that the Republic had \"breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith. [\u2026]\"723; and (ii) by failing to apply the proper law regarding Article 6 of the BIT. Also, the reconstituted Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by (iii) failing to apply the proper law to the issue of expropriation.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 244, citing **A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 404(d).\n\n583.\n\nFor Venezuela, the issue of \"good faith\" was the foundation upon which the Tribunal Majority cemented its finding that Venezuela had breached Article 6(c) of the BIT. In other words, without the interpretation by the Tribunal Majority that Article 6 of the BIT requires \"good faith,\" there would have been no breach of that Article of the Treaty.724\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 256, 257.\n\n584.\n\nOn the issue of *ultra petita,* Venezuela relies on the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Occidental*,725 to argue that a manifest excess of powers occurs when tribunals decide on matters the parties have not raised. Here, the Conoco Parties did not claim that Venezuela had breached its good faith obligation to negotiate. Venezuela finds support by referring to the dissenting opinions of Prof. Abi-Saab and Mr. Bucher, both of which stated that Article 6 of the BIT did not include an obligation to negotiate in good faith, and that the Claimants had not made such claim.726 In these circumstances, Venezuela submits, there is no doubt as to the \"manifest\" nature of the excess.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 242, citing *Occidental Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 247-254, citing **A/R-4 [Curtis] / A/R-45 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion*, \u00b6 282; and **A/R-25 [Curtis]** / **A/R-66 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion II \u2013 Reconsideration Request*, \u00b6 11; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 353-355.\n\n585.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela stated that Conoco's generic claim that Venezuela had unlawfully expropriated their assets in breach of BIT Article 6 is substantially different from the specific claim that Venezuela breached the BIT's obligation to negotiate compensation in good faith.727 Also, Venezuela submits that the legal framework set out by the Parties' in the arbitration did not include an alleged breach of the non-existent obligation to negotiate compensation in good faith. Thus, the Committee cannot allow the Conoco Parties to expand on the legal framework of Venezuela's liability in the arbitration to deny that there was *ultra petita*.728 Conoco's reliance on *Kl\u00f6ckner* is misplaced. That case referred to a tribunal's examination of the jurisdictional \"legal framework,\" while here the issue is that the Tribunal decided that Venezuela had breached the BIT based on an argument not made by either Party, which is also beyond the legal framework of Venezuela's liability.729 Venezuela also argues that the transcript of the 2010 Hearing reveals that Conoco did not claim that the Republic had breached an alleged obligation to negotiate in good faith embedded in the BIT. The Conoco Parties simply did not make that claim in the arbitration and neither did Venezuela respond that it had complies with the BIT's non-existent obligation to negotiate in good faith.730 Lastly, the *ultra petita* is not cured by Venezuela's three reconsideration requests. The excess of powers, in Venezueal's view, occurred with the issuance of the 2013 Decision.731\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 358.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 359, 360.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 361.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 362-366.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 367.\n\n586.\n\nFurther, Venezuela argues the Tribunal Majority exceeded its powers when in the 2013 Decision it egregiously misapplied the terms of Article 6 of the BIT to declare that Venezuela had breached a non-existing \"obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation.\" Venezuela submits that the Majority constructed, without support, Article 6 as encompassing three conditions: first, an obligation to negotiate; second, a negotiation in good faith; and third, a negotiation in reference to the standard of \"market value\" set out in the BIT. None of these conditions are found in Article 6 of the BIT, which were also pointed out by Prof. Abi-Saab and Mr. Bucher in their respective dissents. These opinions serve as contemporaneous evidence on the egregious misapplication of Article 6 of the BIT. Besides, the excess is \"manifest\" as it can be easily perceived from a reading of Article 6, which does not enshrine these three obligations.732\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 282-284; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 394-402.\n\n587.\n\nAlso, the finding that Venezuela \"breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith\" contradicts Article 9(3) of the BIT, which requires that the award \"shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement.\"733Yet, the Majority did not refer to any ground in Article 6(c) of the BIT as a basis for its finding that the provision encompasses an obligation to negotiate in good faith. Such gross misapplication of the law is tantamount to failure to apply the proper law and annullable pursuant to Article 52(1)(b).\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 438, citing R-013 (**A/C-63**), Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (with Protocol), Venezuela - Netherlands, 22 October 1991, entered into force 1 November 1993, 1788 U.N.T.S. 45, Article 9.3.\n\n588.\n\nVenezuela also argues excess of powers on part of the reconstituted Tribunal, specifically when in the Interim Decision it decided that Venezuela had \"unlawfully expropriated\" the ConocoPhillips Dutch Companies' assets. Venezuela submits that such finding resulted from an egregious misapplication of the law that is tantamount to failure to apply the proper law. Venezuela submits that the U.S. Embassy cables pertaining to the negotiations between the Conoco Parties and Venezuela was objective and contemporaneous evidence that belied the finding that Venezuela had breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith.734\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 326\n\n589.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal denied Venezuela's third request for reconsideration as well as Venezuela's claim that the Conoco Parties had made misrepresentations to the Tribunal. Instead, the reconstituted Tribunal in its Interim Decision modified the *dispositif* of the 2013 Decision, and simply replaced the breach \"to negotiate in good faith\" for a breach of \"Article 6 of the BIT by unlawfully expropriating the Claimant's [sic] investments in the three Projects in the Orinoco Beltin [sic] Venezuela.\"735\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 328, 329.\n\n590.\n\nVenezuela submits that the Tribunal identified conditions in Article 6(c) of the BIT which the Majority had failed to identify, including that the state must negotiate proactively, making concrete proposals which are likely to meet the required level of compensation (market value) and which should have a chance to be approved by the investor.736 Venezuela argues that the reconstituted Tribunal added conditions to Article 6(c) of the BIT to convert its terms into an *obligation de r\u00e9sultat* to justify its finding that Venezuela had \"unlawfully expropriated\" the Conoco Parties. However, the terms of Article 6(c) only require measures \"against just compensation\" allowing host States to meet the requirement by establishing a procedure or by offering a sum; Article 6(c) does not require a specific reference to a calculation method in making an offer to the expropriated investor.737Venezuela made several offers of compensation, all of which were found inadequate by the Conoco Parties.738Also, as evidenced from the testimonies of the Conoco Parties' witness (Mr. Geoff) and Venezuela's witnesses (Dr. Mommer and Dr. Bou\u00e9), Venezuela was not negotiating \"book value.\"739\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6334.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 337.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 341.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 350, 351.\n\n591.\n\nAdditionally, the Tribunal failed to apply the terms of Article 6(c) of the BIT and incorrectly interpreted it as requiring the compensation amount offered by the host State to be calculated in a specific method. This is a gross misapplication of the law as shown by Prof. Abi-Saab in his Dissenting Opinion to the 2013 Decision. Venezuela also refers to the *Exxon Mobil* case to argue that the Tribunal should have, like in that case, determined whether the offers made were compatible with just compensation under Article 6 of the BIT. If the Tribunal had done so, it would have found the expropriation to be lawful.740\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 344-346, citing **A/CLA-75** (CL-348), *Venezuela Holdings, B.V., and others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award, 9 October 2014, (\"*Venezuela Holdings Award*\").\n\n592.\n\nVenezuela asks that the Committee pursuant to Convention Article 52(1)(b) annul the *ultra petita* finding in the 2013 Decision that the \"Republic breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith compensation,\" which also constitutes a failure to apply the proper law; Venezuela also submits that, *par voie de cons\u00e9quence*, such annulment will affect the Interim Decision and the Award that draws the consequences of the 2013 Decision seeking to provide compensation for an alleged breach of Article 6 of the BIT.741 Venezuela also requests annulment of the Interim Decision's declaration that Venezuela \"unlawfully expropriated\" the Conoco Parties' assets and *par voie de cons\u00e9quence*, annulment of the Award seeking to quantify the compensation due for such unlawful expropriation.742\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 259, 289.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 355.\n\n593.\n\nVenezuela also argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by determining the valuation date pursuant to international law rather than pursuant to the BIT. The Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law *in toto*, disregarding the express terms of Article 6(c) of the BIT that require compensation for expropriation to be assessed at the date of dispossession.\n\n594.\n\nFurther, by applying customary international law and the standard of \"full compensation\" (*Chorz\u00f3w Factory*) instead of the standard of Article 6(c) of the BIT, the Tribunal exceeded the limits of the powers vested upon it under Article 9(3) of the BIT. Under Article 9(3) the Tribunal lacked authority to award damages beyond those caused by a breach of the Treaty and was, therefore, prevented from moving the valuation date from the date of dispossession to the date of the Award. The Tribunal accepted that the ConocoPhillips Dutch Companies were entitled to compensation for the *lucrum cessans*, reinstating the Companies to the position they would have occupied but for the entire expropriation, rather than just Venezuela's failure to provide just compensation. Yet, it was undisputed that Venezuela had complied with Articles 6(a) and (b), save for the issue of just compensation of Article 6(c).743\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 427-440.\n\n595.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal failed to apply the international customary principles it purported to apply regarding full reparation. Full reparation seeks to reinstate the injured party to the position it would have occupied but for the breach, and not in a more favorable position. However, the Tribunal reinstated the Companies to the position they would be have occupied had they retained their interest in the Projects after the expropriation, whereas the correct condition in the but for test is the lack of payment of just compensation.744\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 444-451.\n\n596.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal usurped powers by determining the valuation date. The Tribunal decided the valuation date *ex aequo et bono*, fixing it on the date of the Award because rising oil prices after the date of the expropriation gave a more favorable compensation. This decision was not based on the proper law, but on an unauthorized and wrong *aequo ex bono* consideration.745\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 456.\n\n***S****erious** **D****eparture from a** **F****undamental** **R****ule of** **P****rocedure***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n597.\n\nVenezuela argues that the *ultra petita* finding that Venezuela \"breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith\" also constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, because the Tribunal Majority deprived Venezuela of its right to be heard and its right to defense. Venezuela relies on the decision of the *Wena* committee defining the \"right to be heard\" as a fundamental right and part of a minimal standard of procedure to be respected under Convention Article 52(1)(d).746 Venezuela also refers to the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Pey Casado v. Chile*, to argue that in the face of a serious departure from a fundamental rule, a committee has no discretion not to annul an award.747\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 263, citing *Wena Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 57.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 268, citing *Pey Casado Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 80.\n\n598.\n\nVenezuela explains that the Conoco Parties did not address the issue of good faith negotiations in their submissions or during the 2010 Hearing, nor did the Republic.748 The Tribunal Majority failed to submit the issue of good faith negotiation to the Parties' consideration before issuance of the 2013 Decision. Thereby, the Tribunal deprived Venezuela of its due process right to be heard, to defend itself or to submit evidence on that crucial issue.749 Venezuela also submits that Prof. Abi-Saab noted in his dissent that the Tribunal's *ultra petita* finding violated the Parties' procedural rights.750\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 265.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 267; Reply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 373-376.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 375, citing **A/R-4 [Curtis] / A/R-45 [De Jesus]**, *Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion*, \u00b6\u00b6 282-284.\n\n599.\n\nVenezuela argues that the departure is serious since it deprived Venezuela of the protection envisaged under the rule i. In Venezuela's Reply, it argues that despite Conoco's allegations to the contrary, Venezuela's actions after the departure (*i.e.*, the issuance of the 2013 Decision) cannot have any bearing on such departure. The Tribunal might have reached a different conclusion in the 2013 Decision and later in the Award, had it allowed Venezuela to state its case and present evidence on that issue. Venezuela submits in the present case, the Conoco Parties posit a heightened standard requiring that the departure leads to a substantially different result, which restricts annulment in the presence of departures from fundamental rules. Venezuela refers to the standards adopted in *Caratube* and *Pey Casado* and argues that a party is not required to prove that the violation of the rule was decisive for the outcome or that it would have won the case.751\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 380.\n\n600.\n\nIn summary, Venezuela submits that deciding on an issue not raised nor discussed by the Parties is a serious departure which vitiates the 2013 Decision, and *par voie de cons\u00e9quence* also vitiates the Interim Decision that sought to clarify the \"true meaning\" of the Majority's finding on the issue of good faith negotiation under Article 6 of the BIT.752\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 269; Reply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 385.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n601.\n\nVenezuela (De Jes\u00fas) also asks the Committee to annul the 2013 Decision, the Interim Decision, and the Award, pursuant to Article 52(1)(e). Venezuela submits they should be annulled because: (i) the Tribunal Majority failed to provide any reasons for its finding in the 2013 Decision that Venezuela had \"breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation [\u2026] on the basis of market value,\"753 and (ii) the reconstituted Tribunal failed to provide reasons for its finding in the Interim Decision that Venezuela had \"unlawfully expropriated the Conoco Parties' assets.\"754\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 290.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 356.\n\n602.\n\nVenezuela submits that, as explained by the *Amco* committee, there must be a \"reasonable connection between the bases invoked by a tribunal and the conclusions reached by it.\"755Yet, the Tribunal failed to provide any reasons, or it provided inadequate reasons for its finding. Venezuela argues that the Tribunal, without referring to any law, case law, authority, or arguments by either Party, affirmed that: \"[I]t is also commonly accepted that the Parties must engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the standard set, in this case, in the BIT, if a payment satisfactory to the investor is not proposed at the outset.\"756This sentence, Venezuela submits, is the extent of the Tribunal's \"reasoning,\" which offers no \"reasonable connection\" regarding the breach of the BIT.757\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 293, citing **A/RLA-62 [De Jesus] / A/RLA-113 [Curtis]**, *Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

How did the Tribunal interpret Article 6(c) of the BIT to entail the \"commonly accepted notion\" of good faith negotiation when \"good faith\" was not mentioned in that article? To whom was the Tribunal referring in its statement \"it is commonly accepted\u2026?\" and how did the Tribunal conclude that Venezuela had not offered a satisfactory payment at the outset of the expropriation or migration? Applying the test in *MINE*, it is not possible to follow the reasons from point A to B, even assuming that the Tribunal applied the law.758\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 300-310; Reply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 411-418.\n\n604.\n\nContrary to Conoco's view, Venezuela affirms that these are not rhetorical questions, and Prof. Abi-Saab and Mr. Bucher raised them in their respective dissents.759 Moreover, several committees, notably in *Soufraki*, have found that inadequate or insufficient reasoning can lead to annulment, despite Conoco's contention for a heightened standard that would prevent committees from reviewing such reasons. Venezuela also refutes Conoco's contention that there was \"common acceptance\" that the legality of the expropriation was contingent on whether Venezuela had negotiated compensation in good faith.760\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 417\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 419-427.\n\n605.\n\nVenezuela recalls that it requested three times the reconsideration of the 2013 Decision, and while all requests were rejected, the Tribunal still found itself at odds with the 2013 Decision's untenable finding, which led to the Interim Decision in an attempt to find its \"true meaning.\"761 Even the Interim Decision denotes the serious faults of the 2013 Decision, which failed to define \"good faith\" or to legally examine its components in relation to the evidence.762\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 313-316.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 319.\n\n606.\n\nRegarding the Interim Decision, Venezuela submits it should be annulled because the reconstituted Tribunal gave contradictory statements concerning the 2013 Decision, which were integrated into the Award.763Venezuela argues that to assess if a tribunal has failed to state reasons, the Committee is empowered to review the award's reasoning. On this point, Venezuela refers to the decision of the *Caratube* committee, according to which \"\u2026 [c]ontradictory reasons cancel each other and will not enable the reader to understand the tribunal's motives. [\u2026]\"764\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 356.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 358, citing *Caratube Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 102.\n\n607.\n\nHere, the Tribunal's reasons cancel each other out in respect to its determination as to \"the true meaning of the 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and Merits.\" In the Interim Decision the reconstituted Tribunal concluded -against the explicit terms of the 2013 Decision- that the Majority did not mean that there was lack of good faith, but \"simply\" that Venezuela failed to be involved in negotiations leading to an offer complying with the requirements of \"just compensation\" and \"market value.\" Yet, the reconstituted Tribunal also stated that \"2013 Decision's conclusion is to be taken for what it says and nothing more.\"765 Then, in the Award paragraph 1009 incorporates the 2013 Decision *in toto* and the Interim Decision *in toto* - with the contradiction that the 2013 Decision found a breach of good faith negotiation (at paragraph 404(d)) and the Interim Decision did not (at paragraph 60).766\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 359-362, citing **A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jesus]**, *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 65.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 361-363; Reply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 468-473.\n\n608.\n\nVenezuela asks that the Committee annul the 2013 Decision for failure to state reasons for the finding that Venezuela \"breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation [\u2026].\" And *par voie de cons\u00e9quence,* that the Committee annul the Interim Decision and the Award which seeks to provide compensation for an alleged breach under Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n609.\n\nVenezuela also asks that the Committee annul the Interim Decision for failing to state reasons regarding its decision to \"clarify\" the \"true meaning of the 2013 Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits\" and *par voie de cons\u00e9quence*, the Award, which seeks to determine the compensation due for the breach of Article 6 of the BIT.767\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6 365.\n\n610.\n\nFor Venezuela, Conoco's argument that the 2013 Decision and Interim Decision are \"wholly consistent\" can be summarily disposed of by comparing their dispositive parts: both found Venezuela in breach of BIT's Article 6, yet each grounded the breach in different non-existent requirements. Additionally, if the decisions were wholly consistent, there would be no need for the Interim Decision to clarify the 2013 Decision. Venezuela notes that its claims target the Award's incorporations of the contradictory operative parts of each Decision; thus Conoco's argument that the Interim Decision confirmed the 2013 Decision misses the point.768\n\nReply (De Jes\u00f9s), \u00b6\u00b6 482, 483.\n\n**C.1(3) The Tribunal's Findings under Article 6 of the Treaty (Conoco)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***N****o** **M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nConoco counters that Venezuela's arguments on the alleged manifest excess of powers are complaints on the Tribunal's interpretation or application of Article 6 of the BIT. Even if the complaints were correct (they are not), they would not be a basis for annulment. An error of law is no ground for annulment. Venezuela tries to argue that the error was so egregious tantamount to non-application of the law.769\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 505, 506.\n\n612.\n\nHere, the Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law and applied it reaching the correct outcome (but it would not make a difference if the Tribunal had erred in the outcome). The Tribunal's decision was not made with a manifest (obvious, self-evident, clear, flagrant) disregard of the applicable law. The Tribunal Majority recounted the general criteria for lawful expropriation in Article 6 of the BIT and then specifically considered what Venezuela had to do to satisfy the compensation requirements in Article 6(c). The Tribunal's interpretation of Article 6(c) is \"payment is not required at the precise moment of expropriation\" because Article 6(c) also includes \"requirements for prompt payment and for interest.\" As such, the Tribunal Majority came to the view that if payment is not made at the precise moment of expropriation, the State must negotiate compensation in good faith based on the BIT's fair market value standard. The Tribunal applied the applicable law (Article 6 of the BIT), even if a party may agree or disagree with the Tribunal's interpretation of the BIT.770 In its Rejoinder, Conoco argues that the Tribunal clearly interpreted and applied Article 6, which Venezuela acknowledges is the applicable law. The Tribunal's interpretation and legal determination made on the basis of Article 6 are within the exclusive purview of the Tribunal which cannot be reconsidered on annulment.771\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 506, 507; Rejoinder (Conoco), 162.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 167.\n\n613.\n\nThe Tribunal Majority correctly interpreted Article 6, as confirmed by the reconstituted Tribunal, so that even if a *de novo* review of the Award were permitted on annulment, Venezuela's argument would fail. Conoco argues that the *Mobil* case accords with the analysis of the 2013 Decision and the 2017 Interim Decision, even though in that case the tribunal majority did not find a breach of Article 6 of the BIT. In both cases (*Mobil* and the present case) the finding as to whether Venezuela had breached Article 6 turns on the question of whether Venezuela had made adequate compensation offers during negotiations. Even if Article 52(1)(b) permitted a review of a tribunal's reasoning, *Mobil* shows that the reasoning in this case was correct, or at least consistent with the conclusions of other tribunals. In these circumstances, there can be no manifest excess of powers.772 In its Rejoinder, Conoco characterizes Venezuela's reliance on *Mobil a*s superficial, in that it fails to accept that different facts in different cases can lead to different outcomes. Contrary to Venezuela's submission, the *Mobil* tribunal did not rule that Article 6 is satisfied when a state acknowledges its obligation to compensate and makes compensation offers. Instead, it ruled that the precise terms of a compensation offer must be evaluated to determine Venezuela's compliance with Article 6(c), and this is precisely what this Tribunal did.773\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 511.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 164, 165.\n\n614.\n\nConoco asserts that the Tribunal considered the arguments and evidence produced and concluded that Venezuela had failed to offer market value compensation as required by Article 6. Venezuela's excess of powers argument is a criticism of the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence. *Ad hoc* committees have no power to review the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence. Under ICSID Arbitration Rule 34, an ICSID tribunal is the sole judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value.774 Even if the Committee engaged in an impermissible review, such review would show that the Tribunal reasonably assessed the evidence, including the U.S. Embassy cables and Mr. Goff's testimony.775\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 512-515.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 169.\n\n615.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco notes that Venezuela's argument that the Tribunal should have evaluated the lawfulness of the taking by looking at whether Venezuela had made offers *prima facie* reasonable or compliant with \"just compensation\" (as opposed to assessing the offers made against \"a specific calculation method,\" *i.e.*, market value). Conoco submits that this was an argument advanced by Venezuela for the first time in the annulment proceeding. In any case, disputes about the proper interpretation of Article 6 are beside the point, and all that is relevant to the Committee's present inquiry is whether the Tribunal identified and sought to apply the applicable law.776\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 171.\n\n616.\n\nAlso, the Tribunal did not rule *ultra petita* when deciding that Venezuela \"breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation \u2026 on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT.\" That finding, Conoco submits, was well within the legal framework established by the Parties' claims and allegations in this case. The Claimants asked the Tribunal to declare that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated the investments under Article 6, including by \"never offer[ing]- let alone provid[ing]- fair, prompt and adequate compensation to the Claimants even though that obligation was codified in \u2026 Article 6 of the Treaty.\"777In the merits phase, the Claimants expressly argued Venezuela's breach of Article 6 for failure to pay fair market value compensation or to negotiate in good faith according to that standard.778Venezuela countered that it had negotiated in good faith and offered fair market value compensation, but the parties disagreed on the amount.779 The Parties also relitigated the legality of the expropriation between the issuance of the 2013 Decision and the issuance of the 2017 Interim Decision. Specifically, the question of the scope of the Tribunal's finding that Article 6 had been breached was raised at the 2016 organizational hearing, was briefed by the Parties in multiple rounds between March and May 2016, was debated at the August 2016 Hearing, and was argued in the September 2019 post-hearing Briefs.780\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 518, citing **A/R-177 [Curtis]** / **A/R-166 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Claimants' Memorial on the Merits*, \u00b6 309.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 519.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 520.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 523; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 175.\n\n617.\n\nIn its Rejoinder Conoco counters Venezuela's argument that Conoco's claim was too generic to support the Tribunal's ruling that Venezuela failed to negotiate compensation in good faith. Conoco maintains that the Tribunal's decision was within the legal framework of the Parties' submissions, as the Claimants argued unlawful expropriation in breach of Article 6, inter alia, by Venezuela's failure to comply with the compensation requirement. Conoco submits that, in any event, the Parties did debate if the expropriation was lawful by reference to whether Venezuela negotiated in good faith against the appropriate standard of compensation, as expressly noted in the 2013 Decision (paragraphs 379, 381).781\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 177.\n\n618.\n\nEven if Venezuela showed that the finding of the 2013 Decision was an excess of powers, its claim still fails because the excess is not manifest. Both the 2013 Decision and the 2017 Interim Decision recount the Claimants' request that the Tribunal \"declare that Venezuela has breached \u2026 Article 6 of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating ConocoPhillips' investments in Venezuela.\" As such, it cannot be argued that the 2013 Decision obviously or clearly contains a manifest excess of power.782\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 522.\n\n619.\n\nConoco also argues that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers by fixing the date of Award as the valuation date. The decision on the appropriate valuation date was not made *ex aequo et bono* and Venezuela's arguments (De Jes\u00fas) are meritless.783 Venezuela's claims that the Tribunal's failure to apply the valuation date under Article 6 of the BIT or as required under customary international law (*Chroz\u00f3w Factory*) are assertions of errors of lawin the interpretation of Article 6 of the BIT and customary international law. However, an annulment application is not an opportunity to reargue points of law, or wrong application of the law. An annulment application should be based on failure to apply the law *in toto*, not an error in applying the applicable law.784\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco) \u00b6\u00b6 543-548, Rejoinder (Conoco) \u00b6\u00b6 187-188.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 525-527; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 180, 181.\n\n620.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal reached the correct result (although it would not matter if it had not). The Tribunal used the date of the Award as the valuation date after considering that (i) the provision of Article 6 of the BIT was silent on the appropriate method to calculate the compensation for unlawful expropriation; (ii) the requirement of customary international law on remedial consequences in the event of an unlawful expropriation; and (iii) that in this case the requirement of \"full reparation\" under customary international law require a date-of-award taking, since oil prices had increased in the period following the unlawful expropriation.785 The Tribunal interpreted Article 6 of the BIT, finding that it did not govern the particular circumstances of this case and turned to customary international law. It is not the Committee's role to assess the correctness of the approach the Tribunal took.786 In its Rejoinder, Conoco argues that Venezuela's claim that the Tribunal failed to apply Article 6 *in toto* when it determined the valuation date based on customary international law misses the mark. Conoco submits that the Tribunal considered the source of law (Article 6) and decided that by its own terms, it did not apply under the circumstances of the case, which does not constitute a failure to apply the law.787\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 526; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 182.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco). \u00b6 527.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 183.\n\n621.\n\nConoco further submits that Article 9(3) of the BIT says nothing about the principles governing a finding of a breach of Article 6 and the award of compensation for damages. Even if it were true that Article 9(3) restricted the Tribunal's ability to award damages based on the date of Award, such critique would again be an error of law. Further, as shown by paragraph 90 of the Award, the Tribunal applied Article 9(3) of the BIT: it identified the provision, considered that provision, and dismissed Venezuela's claim that its terms mandated a date-of-taking valuation.788 In its Rejoinder Conoco notes that Venezuela fails to engage with the Tribunal's holdings on Article 9(3) and Conoco's submission in the Counter-Memorial.789\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 529, 530.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 184.\n\n622.\n\nConoco also submits that it was never its position that, if the expropriation was unlawful *sub modo*, compensation would be required only on a date-of-taking basis. Conoco argues that Venezuela has used truncated quotations from the Claimants' arguments at the 2010 Hearing, to wrongly assert that the Parties agreed on the legal principles relevant to the appropriate valuation date. But there never was an agreement on the date-of-taking valuation, and the Tribunal did not exceed its powers when it ruled as it did.790\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 531-539.\n\n623.\n\nEven if there was such an agreement, that would still not constitute an excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b). For the Tribunal to have manifestly exceeded its powers it must have acted \"beyond the limits of its constituent instrument.\"791Conoco submits that the type of party agreement implicated by this annulment ground in an agreement on the applicable law, falling within the scope of Convention Article 42. The fact that the parties might have similar views on the interpretation of the law is not the kind of party agreement that might limit a tribunal's authority to decide an issue in a particular way. Even if the Parties had a common ground for the interpretation of Article 6 of the BIT and customary international law, it would not bind the Tribunal's interpretative792 powers.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 541, citing *Churchill Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 239.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 542.\n\n***N****o** **F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n624.\n\nConoco submits that Venezuela's (De Jes\u00fas) failure to state reasons argument is meritless. The Tribunal stated its reasons for its finding in the 2013 Decision that Venezuela breached Article 6 of the BIT, but Venezuela disagrees with the reasons. Both Parties presented arguments -and authorities in support- on the question of whether the lawfulness of expropriation by virtue of Venezuela having failed to offer fair market value compensation in good faith. The Tribunal was correct that it was \"commonly accepted\" that if payment is not made at the outset, an expropriating state must at least engage in good faith negotiation to pay the compensation under the treaty standard. The Tribunal was not, however, required to provide references supporting that proposition, which had already been provided by the Parties.793 Parties have demonstrated their \"common acceptance\" in respect of the requirements of Article 6 as shown by their positions on Article 6(c), which turned on whether Venezuela had offered fair market value compensation in good faith.794\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 551-554.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 194.\n\n625.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco asserts that Venezuela's arguments fail because an inquiry under Article 52(1)(e) is limited to whether reasons exist and can be followed; it is not about the sufficiency of the reasons (*i.e.*, *why* and *how* the Tribunal reached certain conclusions). Tribunals are not required to provide reasons for reasons. Besides, contrary to Venezuela's contention, the Tribunal's reasoning can be followed from Point A (Article 6) to point B (the finding that if Venezuela did not pay compensation, it had at least an obligation to negotiate to fix compensation under the Treaty standard). Venezuela may disagree with the decision, but the reasons exist and can be understood.795\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 196.\n\n626.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco also replies that Venezuela's (Curtis) argument that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons for its 2013 Decision is inadmissible. In any event, the arguments that the Tribunal did not explain *how* it concluded that Venezuela did not engage in good faith negotiations and that the 2013 Decision cannot be reconciled with the case record, are arguments that the Tribunal erred in its assessment of the evidence. Such inquiry is outside the scope of annulment.796\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 199, 200.\n\n627.\n\nConoco also submits, contrary to Venezuela (Curtis), that the Tribunal did consider if the Discriminatory Action provisions were relevant to the question of Venezuela's compliance with the duty to negotiate compensation in good faith under the BIT's standard. The Tribunal provided coherent reasons which can be followed and concluded that there was no evidence that the compensation formulas played a role in the negotiations.797 On Venezuela's argument that \"the Tribunal never explained how it could possibly arrive at the conclusion that Venezuela did not negotiate fair market value in good faith when Conoco Parties themselves had not presented any valuation using the Treaty valuation date to compare with Venezuela's offer\", and \"[a]ll of the *indicia* in the record as to fair market value as of the date of expropriation supported Venezuela's position and negated any notion that there was a lack of good faith negotiation, as well as any notion that Venezuela was not offering fair market value compensation,\" Conoco replies these are but disagreements with the Tribunal's reasoning, assessment of the evidence and conclusions and not grounds for annulment.798\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 201, 202.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 203, 204.\n\n628.\n\nConoco also argues that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in its 2017 Interim Decision reconfirming the 2013 Decision's finding on the breach of Article 6 of the BIT. For Conoco, the Tribunal's explanation of the 2013 Decision's findings is logical and consistent with the 2013 Decision. Venezuela's disagreement with the Tribunal's reasoning does not constitute grounds for annulment.799\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 555-564.\n\n629.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco submits that Venezuela fails to explain how the Tribunal's argument does not satisfy the standard of Article 52(1)(e) (reasoning capable of being followed from Point A to Point B). Besides, Venezuela's critique ignores the evidence that contradicts its position, the Claimants' submissions, and the Tribunal's reasoning regarding the breach of Article 6. According to Conoco, Venezuela's repetitive requests for annulment were not based on the actual reasons provided by the Tribunal in its 2017 Interim Decision, but rather on the assertion that the Tribunal did not spend enough time rebutting Venezuela's arguments. That is a perversion of Article 52(1)(e), which concerns whether reasons exist, not whether they are convincing or as thorough as a party might have wished.800\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 209-211.\n\n630.\n\nFurthermore, Conoco submits that the 2013 Decision and the 2017 Interim Decision are not contradictory. The 2017 Interim Decision explains the meaning of the 2013 Decision's finding that Venezuela \"breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith.\" It was based not on a finding of subjective bad faith, but rather on a finding that Venezuela \"failed to be involved in negotiations leading to an offer complying with the requirements of 'just compensation' and 'market value'\" as required by Article 6. This conclusion was already clear from the *dispositif* of the 2013 Decision.801\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 565, 566; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 206.\n\n631.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco counters Venezuela's argument that the 2013 and 2017 Decisions are inconsistent because the 2013 Decision found a breach of non-existent obligation, while the 2017 Decision found no breach of such non-existent obligation to negotiate compensation in good faith. This argument, Conoco submits, ignores that the Tribunal consistently found across both Decisions that Venezuela failed to negotiate or offer compensation according to the BIT standard.802\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 208.\n\n632.\n\nConoco further counters that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in its 2017 Interim Decision that Venezuela breached Article 6 of the BIT (failure to negotiate based on fair market value). The Tribunal's decision that Venezuela had not complied with any of the requirements of Article 6(c) and thereby breached Article 6 was correct, and supported by evidence. Conoco submits that the Tribunal considered evidence and arguments presented by both Parties (Embassy cables, the witness testimony of Venezuela's witness and Mr. Goff) but was not persuaded that the evidence demonstrated that Venezuela had offered fair market value compensation. The Tribunal also dismissed the argument that the Claimants' compensation demands were excessive and based on a wrong standard for failure to account for changes in the fiscal regime before the expropriation.803\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 567-573; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 212.\n\n633.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco rebuts Venezuela's allegation that it was \"undisputed\" that Venezuela was negotiating on fair market value. Conoco refers to conclusions drawn by the Tribunal in its 2017 Interim Decision from facts of the record which showed that the Tribunal had given comprehensible and correct reasoning for its finding that Venezuela failed to negotiate on the basis of fair market value. The records include Mr. Del Pino's September 2007 statement that Venezuela would not pay more than book value for Claimants' Projects, Mr. Ram\u00edrez February 2008 speech confirming Venezuela would not provide more than book value compensation, Dr. Mommer's admission at the 2016 Hearing that Venezuela did not make a binding compensation offer, and other WikiLeaks cables demonstrating that by September 2008 Venezuela went to its original position to only pay book value.804\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 212, 213.\n\n634.\n\nLastly, Conoco argues that the Tribunal provided reasons for its decision in the Award that the valuation date should be the date of the Award. Venezuela's real complaint, Conoco submits, is that the Tribunal erred in its decision. Conoco explains how the reasons given by the Tribunal in the Award can be followed. Besides, the Tribunal's decision to set the valuation on the date of award is consistent with the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case and the Tribunal's correct understanding of that case. *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* limited the appropriateness of a date-of-taking valuation to cases where the expropriation in question was not carried out in violation of a treaty; whereas in this case, the expropriation was done in violation of the Treaty.805 In its Rejoinder, Conoco notes that Venezuela (Curtis) had abandoned this argument as it did not address it in its Reply.806\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 575-578.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 218.\n\n***N****o** **S****erious** **D****eparture from a** **F****undamental** **R****ule of** **P****rocedure***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n635.\n\nConoco argues that the Tribunal did not breach a fundamental rule of procedure in its 2013 Decision regarding its finding of Venezuela's breach of Article 6 of the BIT. That finding, contrary to Venezuela's contention, was not taken *ultra petita.* Venezuela was heard on issue of whether it had breached Article 6 by expropriating Claimants' investments and whether it had negotiated fair market value compensation in good faith.807\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 582, 583; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 219, 220.\n\n636.\n\nEven if Venezuela had been deprived of its right to be heard in 2013 (which it was not), it was heard on the same issues in the context of the 2017 Interim Decision. Venezuela was given opportunities during, before and after the August 2016 Hearing to be heard on the issue. There cannot be a serious departure unless the departure leads (or could lead) to a substantially different outcome which would have occurred absent such a breach. Given that the Tribunal heard Venezuela's arguments on this issue and rejected them in the 2017 Interim Decision, there is no basis to claim that any denial of the right to be heard had an impact on the outcome of this case.808\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 582-585; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 220(b), 222.\n\n637.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco notes that it did not mischaracterize Venezuela's argument. Conoco pointed to the references and quotations in its Counter-Memorial demonstrating that the Parties had debated the lawfulness of Venezuela's expropriation based on the evidence in the record regarding compensation negotiations before the 2013 Decision. Even if the Parties had not debated this point, the Tribunal was still free to rule as it did in the 2013 Decision.809\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 221.\n\n638.\n\nConoco also refutes Venezuela's argument that the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by asking the Parties to produce documents that were covered by a confidentiality agreement and exchanged in their settlement discussions between November 2007 and September 2018.810\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 586.\n\n639.\n\nConoco alleges that it was Venezuela who put at issue the period covered by the confidentiality agreement. In the context of its reconsideration requests of the 2013 Decision, Venezuela referred to the Embassy cables reporting on settlement discussions from April and May 2008 to support its position that Venezuela had made fair market value offers and that the Claimants had misled the Tribunal. To determine whether the Claimants have mispresented the facts, the Tribunal asked the Parties for the documents exchanged in the compensation negotiations between November 2007 and September 2008.\n\n640.\n\nVenezuela also fails to establish that settlement privilege is a fundamental rule of procedure in ICSID arbitration. As observed by the *Azurix, Tenaris II* and *Teinver ad hoc* committees, Arbitration Rule 34 grants tribunals wide discretion to order the production of evidence and to determine its admissibility.811 In its Rejoinder, Conoco submits that even if the Tribunal's order had ignored the Parties' Confidentiality Agreement, Venezuela has failed to explain how that would violate Convention Article 52(1)(d) or any other procedural rule since Venezuela only refers to settlement privilege, which is not a fundamental rule of procedure.812 Further, even if settlement privilege were considered a fundamental rule, the Tribunal did not seriously depart from it. Settlement privilege allows for exceptions, and both the abuse of privilege and the waiver exceptions apply in the present case.813 Venezuela admits there can be exceptions but disagrees that they apply in this case, yet that debate is irrelevant since it is beyond the Committee's mandate to review the merits of the Tribunal's evidentiary rulings.814\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 594, 595, respectively citing *Azurix Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 208\u201310, 217; and **A/CLA-93**, *Tenaris S.A. and Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v.

The Tribunal's conclusion that Venezuela failed to comply with its Treaty obligations did not rely on documents presented by the Parties during the compensation negotiations.815 Conoco submits that Venezuela's defence that only the Tribunal knows the extent to which the produced documents influenced its decision is an empty assertion and does not meet the standard to annul the Award under Article 52(1)(d).816\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 605; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 223(c).\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 229.\n\n***C.1(4) T****he** **C****ommittee****'****s** **A****nalysis of the** **G****rounds** **R****elated to the** **T****ribunal****'****s** **F****indings with** **R****espect of** **A****rticle** **6** **of the** **BIT***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n642.\n\nThe Committee examines the challenges brought by both Representations of Venezuela (Curtis and De Jes\u00fas) against the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal that: (i) expropriation by Venezuela of the ConocoPhillips' interests was done in breach of the Treaty because Venezuela never paid or offered fair market value compensation as required by Article 6(c);817 (ii) such breach of the Treaty obligation rendered the expropriation unlawful;818 (iii) the Treaty only sets compensation standards for a lawful compensation while standards for unlawful expropriation are found in customary international law which provides for full compensation;819and (iv) that full reparation necessitates a valuation of the expropriated assets at the date of the award and not at the date of the expropriation.820\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6\u00b6 352, 362, 401, 404(d); **A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Interim Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 60-63.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 153-156.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 223-228, 244-247.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 404(e); Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 431.\n\n**C.1(4)(1) The Committee's Analysis of the Grounds Invoked by Venezuela (Curtis)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n643.\n\nThe same aspects of an award may fall under several grounds of annulment, such as the challenge of the Tribunal's decisions on the legality of expropriation and valuation date.

The Tribunal's factual findings concerning the negotiations are detailed at paragraphs 94-136 of the 2017 Interim Decision, which the Committee will refers to in the forthcoming discussions.\n\nTr. Day 2, 77:4-7.\n\n646.\n\nVenezuela argued before the Tribunal that the Parties' offers were not fundamentally different, with evaluations a few months before expropriation in late 2006 at US$ 2.07 billion following Conoco's cash flow methodology of the Upgrading Projects, and at US$2,3 billion by Venezuela in early 2007 after enactment of the nationalization decree.827 The Tribunal explained that Conoco's figures referred to internal valuations prepared in 2006, before nationalization was decreed when only offers had been made to initiate the process of migration of foreign investments into state companies.828 The Tribunal at paragraph 96 recalled the findings in the 2013 Decision that none of the proposals submitted by Venezuela for valuation in August 2006 and January 2007 was based on compensation in a form other than through the acquisition of minority stakes in the state entities to be formed.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 76.\n\nThe migration process was launched in February 2007 (Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6 339; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 191).\n\n647.\n\nThe Tribunal at paragraph 97 emphasized that a valuation made for a minority holding in a state entity is considerably different from a valuation of the investor's interests held in a company controlled by a majority of foreign investors and enjoying the protection of an investment treaty. The Tribunal in the 2017 Interim Decision further noted that Venezuela admitted the difference between migration and expropriation. One would have therefore expected, according to the Tribunal, (at paragraphs 110 and 111 of its Decision) that the difference between the valuation of compensation for nationalization and for migration to be reflected in the negotiations on expropriation which had been ongoing in 2007; however, this appeared not to be the case in Venezuela's consideration.\n\n648.\n\nThe Tribunal further explained at paragraphs 111 and 112 that expropriation triggered compensation for the value of the asset and profit over the whole of the remaining life of the projects, and that while Venezuela's insistence on book value or similar lower value levels had a short-term future in light of possible arbitration claims. At paragraphs 112 of the 2017 Interim Decision, the Tribunal could not find any evidence that Venezuela was considering a shift towards fair market valuation. The Applicant argues that the Tribunal ignored the agreement emerging from testimony on both sides that Venezuela was not walking away from fair market value.829 The truth is that the Tribunal could not find any agreement from its factual assessment of the negotiation history. It instead noted that, as of June toAugust 2007, the Parties were reported to be billions of dollars apart.830\n\nTr.

The Applicant argues before the Committee that ConocoPhillips never submitted a fair market value at the Treaty date of valuation on January 2007 and instead threw around fantasy numbers of US $ 40, 46 or 28 billion, until they were requested at the August 2016 quantum hearing to disclose the valuation prepared for purposes of the arbitration, which revealed figures of US$ 2.477 billion giving effect to the compensation provision, and US$ 5.855 billion without the cap of the compensation provisions.831 The Applicant asserts that it is incomprehensible how the Tribunal could find that Venezuela's offers were so far away from fair market value as to render the expropriation unlawful and that the offers of US$ 4 billion and 3.1 billion reported in the Request for Arbitration832 were tantamount to no offer at all.833\n\nTr.

The Tribunal noted that Venezuela made offers of US$4 billion and US$6.7 billion in the context of an asset swap in June-August 2007 and US$3.1 billion on 2 August 2007 while Conoco claimed US$ 20 billion in August-October 2007 and about US$ 30 billion in September 2008 (paragraphs 103, 105, 128).834 The Tribunal explained that expropriation accounted for Conoco's claim on higher amounts than for migration based on market value including request for forthcoming oil price increases (paragraph 111). Its assessment of the negotiation scene was that Venezuela changed its position from a more market-oriented approach to the original book value or similar lower value levels because the first active steps of the arbitration were looming in September 2008 at the time the negotiations were breaking down and Conoco was not prepared to settle for a much lesser amount than US$30 billion which they were going to claim (paragraph 128). The Tribunal found that Venezuela had failed to provide any convincing evidence in respect of the relevant facts alleged in support of its misrepresentation claims (paragraph 135).\n\nSee also Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6 348.\n\n651.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Applicant's essential argument concerns the fact that the Tribunal could not see that an offer of US$ 4 billion was not unreasonable when ConocoPhillips was not doing a 2007 valuation.835 This will be examined by the Committee bearing in mind the Tribunal's declaration at paragraph 135 of the 2017 Interim Decision that ConocoPhillips' alleged misrepresentations \"*appears reduced to the simple question whether or not Venezuela had submitted an offer based on fair market value during its negotiations with ConocoPhillips' representatives*.\" Venezuela contested in the underlying arbitration that never made fair market value offers. The Tribunal noted (at paragraph 120) of the Interim Decision the statements made by Conoco's chief negotiator, whose testimony was relied on heavily by the Applicant to counter the finding that Venezuela insisted on book value during the negotiations,836 that \"[*w*]*hile Venezuela is said to accept fair market methodology, the 4 April 2008 cable also says that this observation does not apply to the totality of ConocoPhillips' claims*,*\"* and the April 2008 Embassy cable was \"*not always easy to understand*.\" The Tribunal found that the cable was certainly not as clear as Venezuela argued. While Venezuela's acceptance of fair market methodology is reported in the cable for the expropriated assets, the Tribunal emphasized that the cable did not refer to any proposal or offer actually made on Venezuela's behalf. Furthermore, the May 2008 cable did not report on any offer submitted by Venezuela and neither of these two cables included evidence that Venezuela had submitted any concrete offer based on fair market value. In summary (at paragraphs 121 and 122), the Tribunal found as matters of fact that no evidence had been supplied in support of an allegation that an offer based on fair market values was submitted after November 2007, that Venezuela backtracked to its original position to pay only book value (paragraph 123). These findings of fact should further be read with the Tribunal's understanding (at paragraph 109) that the term 'book value' was used to describe Venezuela's position that it will object to any compensation based on fair market value as determined by Conoco which is more than one derived through its accounting method of valuation.837\n\nTr.

The Committee has no authority to perform a *de novo* review of the factual questions or evidential records that have already been assessed by the Tribunal.838 In the same vein, the Committee could not overrule the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence, including witness testimony, regarding Venezuela's failure to offer compensation on fair market value in the negotiations.839 Notably, the Applicant points to the Committee the cavalier dismissal of the internal valuations made by ConocoPhillips, the confusion of Venezuela's position and offers in connection with the migration process, the Tribunal's ignorance of the closeness of the US$ 2.3 billion March 2007 offer to ConocoPhillips' internal valuations, ignorance of Venezuela's offers of US$ 3.1 and 4 billion, its ignorance of the reasonableness of all Venezuela's offers and ignorance of witness testimony, its failures to appreciate the U.S. Embassy cables as well as factors of major importance relating to the Parties' different assumptions of the compensation provisions as well as the impact of post-nationalization oil price increases and the relevant fiscal regime and, finally, sweeping ConocoPhillips' misrepresentations under the rug.840 To the Committee, these are attempts by the Applicant to substitute its own assessment of the circumstances surrounding the negotiations to that of the Tribunal , without showing that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its conclusions. The Applicant's contention that the Tribunal made \"*indefensible findings regarding the negotiations, culminating with its unsustainable conclusion that Venezuela had failed to make any reasonable offers of compensation*\"841 is beyond the Committee's reach under Article 52.\n\n*Suez Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 133, 299; *Tulip Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 85.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 454-455.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 507, 511-513, 517, 519-524, 526-529; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 255.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 506, see also \u00b6\u00b6 628-630.\n\n653.\n\nComing now to the claim of a manifest excess of powers, the Applicant views the Tribunal's finding of an alleged failure to negotiate compensation in good faith in the 2013 Decision as an excess of authority due to failure to apply the applicable law. The Applicant argues that the Tribunal invented (at paragraphs 401, 404(d) of the 2013 Decision) a new legal principle, namely, failure to negotiate compensation in good faith means that expropriation should be considered unlawful, which was later acknowledged by the Tribunal to be incorrect in the 2017 Decision.842 Since, according to the Applicant, the incorrect standard of good faith negotiations was abandoned in 2017, the argument misses the mark. The Applicant submits that the Tribunal overlooked two universally accepted principles when assessing claims of expropriation: failure to receive compensation and a disagreement over the compensation alone does not render an expropriation unlawful.843\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 590.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 589, 591, 594; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 222, 224.\n\n654.\n\nIn support of the first principle, the Applicant refers to the *Mobil* award which concluded against the same factual background regarding migration from private participation to mixed company structure in the oil production sector, that the expropriation was lawful as the only missing element was compensation.844 In both cases, it is undisputed that, although Venezuela admitted that ConocoPhillips, like the *Mobil* parties, were entitled to compensation and made substantial compensation offers, no payment was made.845\n\n*Venezuela Holdings Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 288-306.

The Committee must do with the Tribunal's conclusions in the 2017 Decision that, as previously determined in the 2013 Decision, Venezuela did not envisage, conduct or propose to ConocoPhillips a market valuation as required by Article 6(c) of the Treaty, nor did it make any offer based upon such valuation (see paragraph 113 of the 2017 Interim Decision). Furthermore, Venezuela made no reasonable offer for compensation or other equivalent contribution in the near future, either through negotiations that had been conducted or on its own initiative (see paragraph 129 of the 2017 Interim Decision).\n\n657.\n\nAs remarked by the Mobil Tribunal, \"[i]*n order to decide whether an expropriation is lawful or not in the absence of payment of compensation, a tribunal must consider the facts of the case*.\"849 In the Committee's view, the marked difference between the *Mobil* case and the present case is that the tribunal in *Mobil* case did not find that Venezuela's proposals were incompatible with the requirement of just compensation of Article 6(c) of the Treaty.850 This was not the finding of the Tribunal in the underlying arbitration. The Applicant's reference to the *Mobil* award would become relevant if the Tribunal, like the *Mobil* tribunal, had acknowledged that Venezuela's offers met the requirement of Article 6(c). However, the Committee is bound by the Tribunal's opposing factual finding and cannot overturn this conclusion.\n\n*Venezuela Holdings Award*, \u00b6 301.\n\n*Venezuela Holdings Award*, \u00b6 305.\n\n658.\n\nThe Committee notes further that by applying his legal analysis of Article 6(c) of the Treaty to the facts of the case, Prof. Abi-Saab took the view that \"*an offer of 2.3 billion US dollars is hardly negligible, and in spite of the wide ranging estimations of the Claimants, it is worth recalling that this offer corresponded almost exactly to the internal estimates of the two Projects by the Claimants themselves* [\u2026] *just a few months before the expropriation*.\"851 The Committee feels obliged to clarify that while a dissenting arbitrator, as an adjudicator of the merits of the dispute, may take contrary factual observations, this Committee is not permitted to do the same, whether by agreeing with the dissenting arbitrator or coming to a different assessment of the fact as the Tribunal had done.\n\n**A/R-4 [Curtis] / A/R-45 [De Jesus]** , *Abi-Saab Dissenting Opinion*, \u00b6 261.\n\n659.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to the Applicant's assertion that the documentary and oral record concerning Venezuela's substantial offers that did not come to fruition was due to Conoco's negotiation position of taking an above fair market value standard. In the Committee's view, had the Tribunal found that Venezuela's offers complied with Article 6(c), there could be room for Venezuela to advance such a criticism. However, it was Venezuela's failure \"*to be involved in negotiations leading to an offer complying with the requirements of 'just compensation' and 'market value'*\"852 which led the Tribunal to declare the expropriation as unlawful. The Tribunal was therefore not only dealing with a situation of a mere failure to receive compensation or any disagreement over compensation. The criticism made against the Tribunal is therefore unsustainable.853 Again, the Committee's task is to review the Award as it was made by the Tribunal, not as it should have been made following the Applicant's indications.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jesus]**, *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 60, \u00b6 151: \"*There is no dispute about the fact that the measures enforced on 26 June 2007 have not been taken against 'just compensation' as required by Article 6(c).

It further argues that even if the Tribunal could be said to have applied international law, it failed to actually apply its principles.855\n\nTr. Day 2, 18:7-11.

The resulting compensation would simply be deferred from July 2007 to the date of this Award, together with interest. There would be no sanction of a manifest breach of the provision of Article 6(c) of the BIT, which implies a breach of Article 6 as a whole when prohibiting expropriation as long as one of the three pertinent conditions is not fulfilled. In the meantime, in the period between the taking and the rendering of this Award, the Projects would operate as decided by the Venezuelan Government and with all the benefits accruing to them, in particular when taking into account the increase in oil prices.

In particular, the Tribunal notes:\n\n\"*For this part of the expropriation, no compensation would ever be paid. Such a result is implied in a compensation scheme as provided by Article 6(c) of the BIT, provided payment occurs at the same time. If such compensation is not effectively made or differed, the expropriating State would take on both levels: no account is provided for the market value at the date of the taking, and the full actual and future value of the Projects as from that date accrues to the State*.\"863\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 227.\n\n665.\n\nIn the Committee's view, to the extent that the Applicant claims that the Tribunal disregarded Article 6, the above extracts from the 2013 and 2017 Decisions and the Award clearly demonstrate that the Tribunal did not omit or neglect Article 6 and it had considered this provision as applying to the 26 June 2007 expropriation.\n\n666.\n\nAs to the Applicant's other contention for awarding compensation far beyond the alleged Treaty breach in disregard of Article 9(3) of the Treaty, the Committee considers that this provision which reads:\n\n\"*The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of obligations has caused damages to the national concerned, and, if such is the case, the amount of compensation*\"\n\nspells out the Tribunal's scope of findings which excludes any consideration of breaches of non-Treaty obligations. Contrary to the Applicant's assertion, the Tribunal only considered compensation for failure to pay for expropriation in breach of the Treaty to interest from the date payment was due until the date of payment.864 The Tribunal had applied no law other than the one agreed to by the Parties in Article 9(5).\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 558, 600; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 279.

According to the Applicant, this is an invention by the Tribunal beyond the terms of Article 6(c) evincing a \"*gross misunderstandings of fundamental principles of international law*.\"865 The Tribunal should have considered the Applicant's argument that where negotiations in good faith are taking place on the basis of fair market value, the valuation date does not move just because there is a disagreement on the precise amount of that amount.866 It bears recalling that the Tribunal did not find a breach of Article 6 because there was a disagreement about the amount of compensation, but because Venezuela's obligations to negotiate against the right standard had been breached.867 The Tribunal already considered in the 2013 Decision the consequences of such unlawfulness for valuing compensation with decisions declaring customary international law on the matter:\n\n\"*The Tribunal, on the basis of principle and the authorities reviewed above, concludes that if the taking was unlawful, the date of valuation is in general the date of the award.*\"868\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 558.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 268.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 60.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6 343.\n\n668.\n\nThe Applicant relies on the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* decision,869 international jurisprudence, awards and academic writings to demonstrate that the date of valuation is the date of dispossession when the only wrongful act is the failure to pay compensation and when the expropriation is lawful in other respects.

The Tribunal remarked that the time factor is not addressed in the expropriation *sub modo* but only the situation of a missing payment at the time of the taking, which is therefore not saying \"*that an expropriation is lawful if only payment of effective compensation is missing and that it remains so for the future*.\"876 The Tribunal considered that the terminology \"lawful expropriation\" might not be the most appropriate when one of the key elements of an expropriation, such as compensation, is missing. It observed that the term, as used in a number of awards, means that an investor that suffered an expropriation otherwise \"lawful,\" save for the non-payment of compensation, is not entitled to claim more than the payment of such compensation reflecting the market value of the investment at the moment of the expropriation plus the interest to the day of the payment.877 The Tribunal distinguished cases where the difference between compensation is determined at the moment of expropriation and the assessment of damages resulting from the omission to provide such payment at that time, from cases, such as the present one, where the requirement of negotiating \"just compensation,\" which is one of the three conditions to render an expropriation lawful under the Treaty, has not been fulfilled by Venezuela.878\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6\u00b6 340-342.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 384, 455, 460-464, 550-556.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 217.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 218.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 219.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 221-223.

There is thus room for debate on the principles of customary international law which would have been neglected by the Tribunal in characterizing the expropriation as unlawful and drawing consequences on the valuation date.886\n\nReply, (Curtis), \u00b6 278.

The Applicant says that the Tribunal, \"*engaged in an erroneous and convoluted reinterpretation of Chorz\u00f3w Factory as supporting the view that it would be 'unjust' if an expropriating State was ordered to pay compensation limited to the value of the investment as of the date of the taking plus interest*.\"889\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 633-637.\n\nSee Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 218.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 550-552.\n\n673.\n\nIn the following passages of the Award, the Tribunal noted at paragraph 217 that the *Chorz\u00f3w* Court made the distinction between lawful and unlawful expropriation when the Court suggested890 that if Poland's wrongful act had merely been nonpayment of the value at the moment of taking, that amount plus interest would be all that was due, even though a denial of payment is a wrongful act as well. The Tribunal refused to treat certain treaty breaches, such as those concerning the compensation obligation, as non-violations. The Tribunal declared that the difference for the aggrieved party between an expropriation legally carried out, except for the non-payment of compensation, and an expropriation made in compliance with all legal requirements could not be reduced to a simple matter of interest to be paid. At paragraphs 213 and 214 of the Award, the Tribunal determined that at a later date following expropriation, the value of the expropriated property, given its investment nature, should be calculated by a reference to a higher market price, unlike normal deposit accumulating with the rate of interest in the bank account. The Tribunal observed at paragraph 215 of the Award that, while the *Chorz\u00f3w* Court did not elaborate on whether the full value of expropriation should be determine only through information at the time of the taking, or with the information that later became available, the *Chorz\u00f3w* Court was of the view that the aggrieved investor should not be put into the unfavourable position with entitlement to only \"just compensation\" plus interest, when it is protected from expropriation without compensation determined by reference to the market price or value at the time of the taking.891\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory Judgment*, p. 47.\n\nSee also **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 216 (\"If compensation was awarded a certain time after the taking as the 'just price' for what was expropriated, together with interest, the hots State would be treated more favourably than the situation it would face with an expropriation that should not have taken place without compensation\").\n\n674.\n\nThe Tribunal reminded at paragraphs 224 and 225 of the Award that the *Chorz\u00f3w* Court instructed the experts on reparation to consider all consequences of an unlawful act with two valuation options, one based on the value on the date of expropriation plus profits from the date of expropriation to the date of the judgment and another based on the value of the expropriated asset at the time of the judgment. At paragraph 230 of the Award, the Tribunal noted that the Parties' debate over the valuation date centred on the distinction between an *ex-ante* valuation, as of the date of the taking, or an *ex-post* valuation, which include all available actual and future data. The Committee notes that determining the full value at the date of expropriation could involve the investment value at the date of expropriation based solely on information known at the date of expropriation (*ex-ante* information), or the investment's value as of the date of expropriation using information available at the award date (*ex-post* information). The latter approach would yield the same result to the award date, and a valuation on the date of the award was ultimately selected by the Tribunal at paragraph 244 of the Award for determining the compensation amount. The Tribunal found (paragraph 241 of the Award), that none of the *ex-ante* or *ex post* valuations can be conducted according to its own logic and, at paragraph 243 of the Award, that the Parties' debate showed that one or the other method cannot be adopted without a number of adjustments. In light of its finding that the State could take advantage of the difference between profits from the operation of the expropriated projects and the applicable interest if payment was deferred beyond the expropriation date, the Tribunal (see paragraphs 250 and 251) declared that an *ex-post* valuation corrects the unequal treatment by determining the deferred payment based on the prevailing market value at the time.\n\n675.\n\nBefore examining how the Tribunal conducted this debate on the basis of investment jurisprudence for translating into monetary compensation the full reparation standard of *Chorz\u00f3w*, the Committee concludes that it cannot share the view that it is impossible to follow the Tribunal's reasoning. Under the cloak of an argument of failure to state reasons, the Applicant expresses disagreement with the Tribunal's appreciation of the *Chorz\u00f3w* judgment and on the criteria for illegality and the consequences of the illegality for damages.\n\n676.\n\nThe Tribunal identified cases in investment jurisprudence where compensation was treated as one of the conditions for an expropriation not prohibited under the treaty, with the effect, that if no compensation has been paid, an unlawful expropriation would result as if the other requirements had not been met.892 The Applicant says that the Tribunal distorted this body of authorities to reach its decision on the valuation date.893 In support of its manifest excess of powers contention, the Applicant refers to other passages894 of the same decisions than those cited and footnoted in the Award.895 None of the quotes in the Applicant's submissions or the Award are inaccurate. The Applicant links together the passages it has chosen as demonstrating that the valuation date does not move in case of expropriations merely lacking compensation. The Tribunal's selection aimed at demonstrating that the Treaty standard does not apply in case of unlawful expropriation, a notion which includes when compensation as one of the cumulative requirements to be met, has not been paid, and that an ex-post valuation is required in accordance with the full reparation principle under customary law.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 257*.*\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 586.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 571-581 \u00b6\u00b6 601-607.

The Award which found that the Treaty requires negotiations with the investor leading to an offer complying with the requirements of just compensation and market value and damages based on value at the award date is another illustration of the distinction between lawful/unlawful distinction with effect on damages. That the Award is not the carbon copy of a previous decision of another tribunal is no indication of a manifest excess of powers. The respective use of the same decisions as illustration of the distinction between lawful and unlawful expropriation in case of lack of compensation and of the consequences on the application of the treaty standards of compensation demonstrates that denaturation of these authorities is not at stake. It points instead to the pertinence of the grouping together of the selective choice of decisions made by the Tribunal and the interpretation it gave to the interrelationship of this body of decisions in the complex area of expropriation compensation. It remains open to debate whether a Treaty compensation obligation requires the State to be involved in negotiations with the investor leading to an offer complying with just compensation and market value, should have treated as violations the same in terms of remedy under the full reparation standard or if nuances should have been introduced.\n\n**A/RLA-122 [Curtis]**, *Crystallex International Corporation v.

Tr. Day 2, 49:19-24.\n\n680.\n\nThe Committee observes the alleged premature finding is in the same award as the finding that the expropriation is not covered by the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements.905 This would render the Applicant's argument moot, or unacceptable as an attempt to review the correctness of the approach taken by the Tribunal under Article 52(1)(e).906 The Committee, nevertheless, answers by remarking that the Tribunal's focus was on whether the Parties' attitude in the negotiations complied with the requirements of Article 6(c) and not on the determination of compensation. The evidence before the Tribunal was that these formulas were not brought into the negotiations, in particular by Venezuela.907 The Tribunal elaborated further in the 2017 Decision on the lack of relevance, influence and impact of these provisions on any concrete offer.908 Against this situation where the formulas were not relied upon in support of its contention that its offers complied with fair market value, the Applicant's challenge on that count is devoid of any relevance.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 171.\n\n**A/RLA-57 [Curtis]**, *Total S.A. v.

Before coming to the substance of the Applicant's grievance, we examine the complaint regarding the lack of explanations for how the Tribunal discovered in 2017 a power the majority had twice said before it did not have and why, if the only basis for unlawfulness in 2013 had been incorrect, the Tribunal could simply adopt a new basis for unlawfulness.909\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 300.\n\n682.\n\nOn 10 March 2014, the Tribunal denied Venezuela's first reconsideration request910 and on 9 February 2016, its second reconsideration request,911 before deciding on 19 August 2016 to hear Venezuela's third request of 20 April 2016.912 As Venezuela pleaded in the arbitration that there was no justification for not reconsidering the wrong 2013 Decision, it cannot now complain in the annulment about the Tribunal's decision to reconsider the 2013 Decision. We nonetheless understand the Applicant's complaint as directed against the confirmation of the unlawfulness of the expropriation in the 2017 Decision, albeit for other motives than in the 2013 Decision.\n\n**A/R-40 [Curtis]** / **A/R-81 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, 10 March 2014 (\"*Reconsideration Decision*\").\n\n**A/R-217 [Curtis] / A/R-182 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision of 10 March 2014, 9 February 2016.\n\n**A/R-98 [Curtis] / A/R-139 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Procedural Order No. 4, 19 August 2016 (\"*PO4*\").\n\n683.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the statements in the operative part of the 2013 Decision that Venezuela has breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation on the basis of the fair market value as required by Article 6(c) of the Treaty and the statements in the 2017 Interim Decision that the Tribunal did not find a lack of good faith on the part of Venezuela for its breach of an obligation to negotiate on the basis of fair market value913 are incomprehensible and cannot explain why everyone understood para. 404(d) of the 2013 Decision as a finding of bad faith negotiations.914 The Tribunal acknowledged in the 2017 Decision that the true meaning and effects of the 2013 Decision's statements in para. 404(d) \"*remained a matter of debate*\".915 The Tribunal's reasons for clarification are found at paras. 52-66 of the 2017 Decision. The Tribunal more particularly explained that the term \"bad faith\" was never used in the 2013 Decision in connection with the negotiations. It noted that it never identified the term \"good faith\" which appeared in connection with negotiations in the Parties' submissions and stated that the quotations of the term \"good faith\" as used by the Tribunal in the 2013 Decision demonstrate that no distinction was ever made between \"negotiating\" and \"good faith\" which have always been used conjunctively. This meant for the Tribunal that para. 404(d) was based on Venezuela's failure to negotiate on the basis of market value and not on a purported attitude of bad faith on part of Venezuela during the exchange of views that actually took place.916 The Tribunal's reasoning can be followed, even if it does not do justice to Venezuela's claims that, absent a finding of bad faith, it should have followed that the expropriation was not illegal and that the valuation date should be the date of expropriation.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 60 *(*\"*Based on the above analysis of the 2013 Decision, the conclusion is that the Tribunal did not find a lack of good faith on the part of the Respondent for its breach of an obligation to negotiate on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT. The Tribunal stated simply that the Respondent failed to be involved in negotiations leading to an offer complying with the requirements of 'just compensation' and 'market value').* Tr.

The Tribunal redefined through reinterpretation the finding of lack of good faith negotiation and therefore the basis of unlawfulness of the expropriation despite the record of the case which shows that Venezuela was negotiating on the basis of fair market value917. In support of its allegation that the Tribunal's conclusions following which Venezuela's offers were so grossly inadequate as to be tantamount to a denial of compensation are irreconcilable with the undisputed facts of the case, the Applicant refers us to a table reproducing Venezuela's compensation offers.918\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 622, 628-629; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 299, 301-304.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 631; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 204.\n\n685.\n\nThe Committee has already examined, under the unlawfulness of the expropriation, the Tribunal's evaluation of the Parties' respective offers both before and after the filing of the request for Arbitration which runs through paras. 94-136 of the 2017 Decision. We may therefore be brief. Failure to state reasons exists whenever a pertinent piece of evidence has been left unaddressed by the Tribunal without discussion of its probative value.919 An arbitral tribunal has otherwise no duty to motivate why it did not consider each and every piece of evidence introduced in the case by the parties.920 The Applicant however adds that the Tribunal cannot make decisions totally disconnected from reality and contradicted by the record.921 The situation denounced by the Applicant actually addresses an alleged misunderstanding on the part of the Tribunal of the whole record on the Parties' offers and negotiations. This is different from an omission of relevant items for the decision due to oversight or inadvertence. It does not however behoove the Committee to assess the evidentiary value of these offers. This is well stated law922 and does not concern a failure to state reasons.\n\n*TECO Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 130-133.\n\n*Rumeli Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 104; **A/CLA-77**, *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 \u0130n\u015faat \u0130thalat \u0130hracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v.

The admissibility of evidence bears direct relationship with the fundamental rules of due process which the Applicant prays us to examine regarding the protection of the settlement privilege which, it says, the Tribunal violated in ordering the production by Venezuela923 of documents covered by the Confidentiality Agreement as of 27 November 2007,924 on pain of drawing adverse influences.925 According to the Applicant, the Tribunal had no excuse to cast aside an express agreement of the parties prohibiting the production of documents exchanged in the compensation negotiations which it relied on in the 2017 Decision.926\n\n**A/R-98 [Curtis] / A/R-139 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *PO4*.\n\n**A/C-73**, Confidentiality Agreement Among the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, by Means of the Ministry for the Popular Power of Energy and Oil, and ConocoPhillips Company (previously C-579), 18 January 2008.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 396, 478-480, 499-505.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 638, 644; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 333, 348, 351.

Even assuming the materiality of the breach, the Tribunal's decision of an unlawful expropriation would still rest on other evidence of the non-compliance of Venezuela's offers which can be read at paragraphs 94-135 of the 2017 Decision.933 At any rate, the Applicant has not established the serious nature of the departure from confidentiality which might have been caused by the Tribunal's assessment of the evidentiary weight of Venezuela's offers.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 70-75.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 503.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 100.

Negotiation in good faith was raised at para. 334 (4) of the 2013 Decision as one of the four issues to be determined in answering ConocoPhillips' claim that Venezuela breached Article 6 of the Treaty with the expropriation. Issues to be determined, which describe the steps in a tribunal's reasoning, should not be confused with claims which delimit the tribunal's mission. Only decisions beyond the mission limits are *ultra petita*. Having clarified in the 2017 Decision that the operative part of the 2013 Decision at para. 404(d) is based on Venezuela's failure to negotiate on the basis of a fair market value and not on a purported attitude of bad faith on its part during the exchanges of views that took place during the negotiations,935 the Tribunal did not draw *ultra petita* legal consequences from the facts introduced by the Parties into the case regarding the negotiations nor denatured ConocoPhillips' submissions on Article 6(c) by deciding a claim that was not submitted by the investor.936 The Tribunal's decision not having been made *ultra petita* and in excess of its powers could not as a consequence have deprived Venezuela of its right to be heard and to submit evidence.937\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 244, 251, 256.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 265; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 373, 374.

Preliminary decisions, such as the 2013 Decision and the 2017 Interim Decision, are not subject to an independent request for annulment. Having been subsequently incorporated in the Award,939 they are only subject to annulment as parts of the Award.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 483.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 43, 1009.\n\n691.\n\nThe Applicant emphasizes an egregious application of Article 6(c) by the Tribunal due to a construction of its terms in para. 362 of the 2013 Decision which enshrines three unwritten, yet cumulative, conditions of (1) an obligation of the host State to negotiate (2) which must be performed in good faith and (3) by reference to the market value standard set out in the Treaty.940\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 276, 282, 287; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 396-397.\n\n692.\n\nPara. 362 of the 2013 Decision, which reads:\n\n\"*362. The requirements for prompt payment and for interest recognise, in accordance with the general understanding of such standard provisions, that payment is not required at the precise moment of expropriation. But **it is also commonly accepted that the Parties must engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation** in terms of the standard set, in this case, in the BIT, if a payment satisfactory to the investor is not proposed at the outset*.\"941\n\nappears in the opening section of the Decision entitled as compensation negotiations in good faith by reference to the standard in Article 6(c). Para. 362 echoes the fourth issue to be determined by the Tribunal at para. 334(4) of the 2013 Decision to resolve ConocoPhillips' claim for breach of Article 6. Para. 362 introduces further developments on the Tribunal's construction of Article 6(c) which are found in the 2013 Decision and in the 2017 Decision, both incorporated in the Award. The Applicant's attack must be properly placed against that background. The Tribunal decided to clarify in the 2017 Decision its rather infelicitous expression \"*obligation to negotiate in good faith for compensation*\" which, it reckoned, \"*remained a matter of debate*\" between the Parties.942 It explained \"*that the Tribunal did not find a lack of good faith on the part of the Respondent for its breach of an obligation to negotiate on the basis of market value as required by Article 6(c) of the BIT. The Tribunal stated simply that the Respondent failed to be involved in negotiations leading to an offer complying with the requirements of 'just compensation' and 'market value*.*'*\"943 We cannot follow the Applicant's invitation to find the Tribunal's interpretation of 2013 untenable in isolation944 when the true meaning of para. 404(c) of the 2013 Decision has been interpreted in the 2017 Decision which are all parts of the same Award. The Applicant's argument945 that the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 6(c) would contradict Article 9(3) of the Treaty which limits the award to breaches of the Treaty only fails accordingly.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 60.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 283.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 286.\n\n693.\n\nWe hold the same for the Applicant's attack on lack of reasons for remarking that the expression \"*it is also commonly accepted that the Parties must engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation*\" in para. 362 does not meet the threshold of a reasonable connection regarding a breach of Article 6(c), absent any reference to a particular law or case law or authority or arguments by either party.946 Failure to cite specific authority is not in itself a ground of annulment, and more particularly since the argument is made in relation of a manifest excess of powers allegation,947 there can be no failure to apply the proper law if the rule applied pertains to such law.948 Here, it cannot be seriously disputed that good faith is a norm of general and fundamental character which is reflected in the general principles of law universally recognized by nations as one of the sources of international law mentioned in Article 9(5) of the Treaty.949 Besides the Tribunal was not required to provide references when documentation was provided by the parties in their submissions.950\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 298; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 414-415, 427.

ConocoPhillips has also suggested that there was common acceptance between the Parties of a good faith participation requirement for a lawful expropriation (Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 553) which has been contested by the Applicant (Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 424.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 55.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 299.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 59.\n\n695.\n\nWe therefore examine at this stage the Applicant's alleged contradiction in the Award between the 2013 Decision and the 2017 Interim Decision regarding the interpretation of the obligation to negotiate in good faith.955 Under the title \"*The True Meaning of the 2013 Decision's Findings in Respect of the Negotiations on Compensation*\" in the 2017 Decision,956 the Tribunal declared that the 2013 Decision does not mention the notion of bad faith in relation to the negotiations on the part of Venezuela (paragraph 53). The Tribunal recapitulated all occasions where the term \"*good faith*\" was used throughout the 2013 Decision, including at para. 362 (paragraphs 55-56) and held that these quotations demonstrate that no distinction was ever made between \"*negotiating*\" and \"*good faith*\" which were always used conjunctively (paragraph 57), before concluding (paragraph 59) that, when the 2013 Decision states that the Respondent was not negotiating in good faith, reference was made to facts demonstrating that the Respondent failed to engage in negotiations leading to just compensation based on market value as required by Article 6 (c) and that nowhere does the 2013 Decision say, in relation to such failure, that Venezuela was acting in bad faith. The Tribunal consequently considered Venezuela's third Application for Reconsideration as moot to the extent it required it to review an assessment of lack of good faith in negotiating for compensation (paragraphs 62-63). The Tribunal's interpretation in 2017 of the 2013 Decision ruling is supported by a sequence of reasons which can be perfectly understood by the Parties. The Committee cannot follow the Applicant's view that the reasons of the 2013 and 2017 Decisions cancel each other out.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 359, 361, 363; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 468.

The expression which is thus singled out follows the Tribunal's prior clarification at para. 60 that Venezuela failed to be involved in negotiations leading to an offer complying with the requirements of just compensation and market value. In the Committee's view, this reads in that context without any contradiction. The second contradiction pointed out by the Applicant is with the Decision of 10 March 2014958 which rejected Venezuela's first Request for Reconsideration of the 2013 Decision.959 This was not the end of the matter, since the Tribunal accepted at the 2016 August hearing on quantum to hear Venezuela's third Request for Reconsideration.960 At any rate, the Applicant does not explain how the Award, inasmuch as it incorporates the motives of the 2017 Decision, would be defective in its reasoning because it would contradict another decision which forms no part of the Award, when the ground of Article 52 (1)(e) is directed against the award's failure to state reasons.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 477-480.\n\n**A/R-40 [Curtis]** / **A/R-81 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Reconsideration Decision*.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 364; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 479.\n\n**A/R-98 [Curtis] / A/R-139 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *PO4*.\n\n697.\n\nWe now concentrate on the Applicant's further challenge of the 2017 Interim Decision for egregiously misapplying the terms of Article 6(c) of the Treaty with other added and unwritten conditions, following which (1) the host State must take a pro-active approach (2) which implies concrete proposals (3) likely to meet the required level of compensation (e.g. market value) and (4) to have a chance to be approved by the investor.961 The Applicant more particularly relies on two expressions found in para. 152 of the 2017 Decision: \"*exclusively if it leads to positive results*\" to justify its previous finding that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated ConocoPhillips when Article 6(c) does not impose an \"obligation de r\u00e9sultat\" and \"*having a chance to be approved by the investor*\" when said Article does not impose an outcome to the negotiations.962\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 334; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 438, 442.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 335-337.\n\n698.\n\nThose expressions must be looked at in the context of the full sentence in which they appear and of paragraph 152 which reads:\n\n\"*The Tribunal, in its 2013 Decision, recognized a margin of flexibility and accepted, **by reference to experience in investment practice**, that the requirement of compensation provided on time is still complied with if the Parties 'engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the standard set, in this case, in the BIT' (para. 362). When referring to the language used in Article 6(c), such negotiation should be engaged either immediately before the measures were taken or when the impending measures became public knowledge, which, in the instant case, refers to a date shortly before 26 June 2007. However, such negotiation that might serve as a transitory substitute for actual payment must be of a nature resulting in providing satisfaction to the investors with equal or with similar effects than actual payment. Article 6(c) further requires that payment shall be made 'without undue delay'; compared to a situation where compensation is addressed through negotiation, such substitute of actual payment is acceptable in the context of Article 6(c) **exclusively if it leads to positive results** without undue delay. In the normal course of proceeding with such negotiations efficiently and without delay, the host State must necessarily take a pro-active approach, which implies that it should put forward concrete proposals likely to meet the required level of compensation (e.g. market value) **and having a chance to be approved by the investor***.\"963\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 152 (Emphasis added).\n\n699.\n\nWe recall that paragraph 362 of the 2013 Decision, which is mentioned in the first sentence, stated that payment of compensation is not required at the precise moment of expropriation as it is commonly accepted that the Parties must engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the standards set in the Treaty if a payment not satisfactory is not proposed at the outset. The end sentence of paragraph 152 completes and concludes that negotiation as \"*a transitory substitute for actual payment, is acceptable in the context of Article 6(c) exclusively if it leads to positive results without undue delay*\" and that \"[i]*n the normal course of proceeding with such negotiations efficiently and without delay*\", \"*the host State should put forward concrete proposals likely to meet the required level of compensation (e.g. market value) and having a chance to be approved by the investor*\". The Applicant gives no clue as to why the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 6(c) sets a threshold beyond what the Parties consented to under the Treaty. Some evidence that the Contracting Parties meant the reverse of what the Tribunal interpreted would have been a useful guide to the Committee for enquiring whether the Tribunal distorted the Treaty's terms. Under the guise of manifest excess of powers, the Applicant invites the Committee to come to a different interpretation of Article 6(c) than that of the Tribunal. Before continuing with the manifest excess of powers ground raised by the Applicant, we deal with its in passing remark on the absence of information provided in the Tribunal's insert \"*by reference to experience in investment practice*\"964 in the opening sentence of para. 152.965 Matters of common knowledge may be noticed without any request by a party. The reader of the sentence is moreover referred to the following quote \"*it is commonly accepted that the Parties must engage in good faith negotiations*\" from para. 362 of the 2013 Decision. We have already answered in that context the Applicant's argument about the absence of authority to support the statement.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 336.\n\n\"*The Tribunal, in its 2013 Decision, recognized a margin of flexibility and accepted, by reference to experience in investment practice, that the requirement of compensation provided on time is still complied with if the Parties 'engage in good faith negotiations to fix the compensation in terms of the standard set, in this case, in the BIT' (para. 362).*\"\n\n700.\n\nThe Applicant's grievance for failure to apply the terms of Article 6 rests on the Tribunal's alleged evasion of its duty to review the underlying uncontested facts that Venezuela made offers which constituted a reasonable amount of compensation for the negotiations regardless of the valuation methodology.966 The Applicant wrapped up its argument at the Hearing as the one thing the Tribunal \"*missed was to say that there had been an offer*.\"967 In support of its allegation that the Tribunal, when finding that no specific reference was made to market value in the negotiations, wrongfully interpreted that Article 6(c) requires a specific method of calculation for the compensation offered by the State,968 the Applicant relies notably here again on Prof. Abi-Saab's dissent that what matters is the magnitude of the sums offered regardless of the accounting method used to calculate such magnitude.969 Nonetheless, to further quote Prof. Abi-Saab's call for examining whether the actual magnitude of the sum \"*reasonably corresponds to a standard of compensation that is prima facie objectively and legally credible in casu*,\"970 the Committee is unable, under the limited relief of an annulment action as contrasted with appeal, to agree with the dissenting arbitrator for overruling the Tribunal's alleged misapprehension of the evidence971 or else find that Venezuela's proposals complied with the just compensation standard as the *Exxon Mobil* tribunal elicited from the evidence before it,972 before censoring the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 6 as wrong.973 Such redress cannot be provided by the Committee.974\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 347, 348, 349; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 455.

When the negotiations were engaged in parallel to the arbitration proceeding, Venezuela never made a concrete proposal. The evidence before the Tribunal demonstrates with stringent clarity that no offer was ever made by Venezuela in order to put a positive end to the negotiation. In addition, Witness Mommer never referred to any written offer submitted by Venezuela's representatives, while admitting that the Government of Venezuela was not authorized to make any monetary commitment without formalizing it in writing. Finally, when Venezuela decided to abandon the negotiations on 8 September 2008, this was a clear sign of its preference to have the matter settled through arbitration, which had no other meaning than admitting that the requirement for just and timely compensation based on market value, as contained in Article 6(c) of the BIT, had not been complied with*\").\n\nTr.

The Tribunal allegedly failed to apply the proper law of the Treaty *in toto* in applying a simplistic and inaccurate approach in its determination of the compensation for breach of Article 6(c) pursuant to the customary international law standard of full compensation, instead of applying the market value at the date of taking Treaty standard embedded in Article 6(c). In doing so, the Tribunal thus circumvented the Treaty provisions and exceeded the limits of the powers vested on it by Article 9(3) of the Treaty to sanction Venezuela.975\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 434-440; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 553-554, 556.\n\n702.\n\nThe Applicant's challenge actually asserts an *in toto* failure \"*to apply the proper law, that is the BIT*,\"976 but which is only part of the proper law designated by the Treaty at Article 9(5) mentioning the general principles of international law in addition to the Treaty provisions,977 such as Articles 6 or 9(3). As stated elsewhere in this Decision, non-application of provisions of the proper law, no more than its erroneous application, which are appellate type arguments that question the tribunal's manner of applying the proper law, amount to a manifest excess of power.978 The Committee nevertheless addresses the arguments raised by the Applicant inasmuch as they challenge partial non-application as having the same consequences for the Tribunal's decision on the valuation date as total non-application.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 553.\n\nArticle 9, 5): \"*The arbitral award shall be based on: i. the law of the Contracting Party concerned; ii. the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties; iii. the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments; iv. the general principles of international law; and v. such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties to the dispute*\".\n\n**A/CLA-85**, *SAUR International S.A. v.

See Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 502.\n\n703.\n\nMoving the date completely, which modified the contours of the but-for-scenario relevant to determine compensation and unduly opened the scope of compensation, is a failure to apply the proper law according to the Applicant. By accepting that ConocoPhillips could receive compensation for the \"*lucrum cessans*,\" the investor was compensated not only for the consequences of a breach of Article 6(c) but also as if it had found that Venezuela had breached Article 6(a) and (b).979 The Applicant recalls that this is in contradiction with the 2013 Decision which found that Venezuela did not incur any breach of its other undertakings under the Treaty save for providing just compensation under Article 6(c). By using the full compensation standard rather than the one of Article 6(c) as if as if the expropriation was unlawful *per se* and not an expropriation *sub modo*, the Tribunal supplemented the terms of the Treaty with international customary law.980\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 439-440, 447; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 557, 561, 563.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 440-442.\n\n704.\n\nWe briefly account for the Tribunal's reasoning regarding Article 6. The Tribunal interpreted Article 6 in the Award as laying down three cumulative requirements for making expropriation measures admissible under the Treaty: (a) public interest and due process, (b) absence of discrimination, (c) just compensation representing the market value of the investment at the time of taking, with the consequence that if one of them has not been met, Article 6 is considered as breached.981 The extent of compensation payable in case of an unlawful taking of an investment cannot be any longer determined under Article 6(c) which only applies if the expropriation accords in all other respects with Article 6. As a result, if the taking is unlawful, the date of valuation for compensation is no more the date of taking envisaged at Article 6(c), it is now the date of the award in compliance with customary international law.982 Having determined in the event that Venezuela breached Article 6, the Tribunal consequently decided that it need not address any breach of Article 6(c) that relates only to one of the three conditions required for a lawful taking.983 The Tribunal accordingly proceeded to determine the standard of reparation and the valuation date under international law.984 We cannot follow the Applicant when it explains the Tribunal's decision to apply international law as disregarding Article 6, \"*not because it considered that this provision did not apply, but simply because it considered that the standard of compensation provided therein was not adequate since it focused on making the Conoco Parties whole and not sanctioning the Republic*\" for its failure to pay just compensation pursuant to Article 6(c).985 The progression of the Tribunal's interpretation leaves no room for the possibility of a usurpation of power by substituting a standard for any other reasons than repairing the harm caused to the Conoco Parties with a treaty violation expropriation. It is only within this meaning that a punitive element could be discerned for putting the incentive on the State for not following the Treaty. Reaffirming the importance of expropriation only according to Treaty is within the goals of reparation as will be examined below with the Applicant's further contestation of the Tribunal's interpretation of the *Chorz\u00f3w* judgment. No demonstration has been made at this stage that the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 6 would exceed the contours of the applicable law provision of Article 9(5) of the Treaty.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 223.\n\n**A/R-2 [Curtis] / A/R-43 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits*, \u00b6\u00b6 342, 343.\n\n**A/R-3 [Curtis] / A/R-44 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Interim Decision*, \u00b6 155.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 195, 244.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 554.\n\n705.\n\nThe Applicant regards the Tribunal's approach as an absurd application of the principle of full reparation enshrined in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* judgment as if the expropriation was unlawful *per se* and not an expropriation *sub modo*986 as appears from the following passage in para. 226 of the Award:\n\n*\"In the meantime, in the period between the taking and the rendering of this Award, the Projects would operate as decided by the Venezuelan Government and with all the benefits accruing to them, in particular when taking into account the increase in oil prices.

As contrasted with a treaty compliant expropriation for which the harm is covered according to the Treaty by value at the date of expropriation:\n\n\"*The Tribunal adds that the proper identification of the remedy for a violation of the BIT should respect the object and purpose of the BIT as this must apply to the BIT's provisions on investment protection in general. If 'just compensation' is determined as per the date of the expropriation, and taken forward through a simple rate of interest, the host State would draw a clear advantage from its taking, as it did in the present case. Thus, such interpretation would result in an incentive for host States to expropriate investments and to defer payment of compensation until an undetermined future date. Such an approach would defeat the purpose of 'protection of investment' that is the object of the BIT as stated in its Preamble*.\"989\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 228.\n\n708.\n\nInclusion of the income from the expropriation to the award in the calculation of damages as the measure of full reparation which is more than the amount in the Treaty for expropriations which respect legal commitments does not give justification to the Applicant's grievance of an overcompensation of the Conoco companies990 that would be indicative of a failure to apply the international customary the Tribunal purported to apply.991 More than expressions of condemnation and disagreement with the Tribunal's interpretation of international jurisprudence would be needed to support an assertion made under Article 52(1)(b).\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 448.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 444.\n\n709.\n\nThe Applicant's grievances about the Tribunal's decision on the valuation date and its consequences on the standard of compensation challenge how the Tribunal combined the different limbs of the proper law designated under Article 9(5) of the Treaty and applied each of them in light of an alleged wrong finding of an unlawful expropriation. The Tribunal's allocation of the respective roles of the Treaty provisions and of the general principles of international law in Article 9(5) is not censurable for annulment. A manifest excess of power challenge raises the question of which other law than the proper law was applied by the tribunal, not the manner in which the proper law and its provisions was interpreted and applied by the tribunal.992\n\n*MCI Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 42 (\"*A distinction should therefore be drawn between, on the one hand, what was decided by the tribunal, which concerns a manifest excess of powers, and, on the other hand, how it was decided by the tribunal, which in principle escapes the scrutiny of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) as concerning the reasoning of the tribunal*\").\n\n710.\n\nThe Committees' conclusion further entails rejection of the Applicant's challenge regarding the non-application of Article 9(3) of the Treaty limiting the award to the amount of compensation of the damages caused by a breach of an obligation which was raised as a consequence of the disregard of the Treaty provisions on compensation because of the Tribunal's lack of authority to award damages by moving the valuation date.993\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 438 (see also \u00b6 286); Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 555-556.\n\n711.\n\nThe Applicant finally challenges the decision on the valuation date issue for manifest excess of powers because of the Tribunal's usurpation of *ex aequo et bono* powers with reasons based not on the law, but on the rising oil prices after the date of the taking to provide for a more favorable compensation that would otherwise be due. Thus, the decision is not a misinterpretation of the full compensation standard under customary international law but is based on the objective to sanction Venezuela for the advantage it may have obtained from the 2007 taking due to the increase of oil prices.994\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 452, 456; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 568, 569.

We find the Applicant's accusation purely inferential as the Tribunal never claimed to have the power to decide *ex aequo et bono* or had in fact attempted to do so. The Applicant cannot identify terminology in paragraph 229 of the Award that would denote that the Tribunal used equitable considerations in its reasoning on making the investor whole as a consequence of the unlawful expropriation. By holding that \"*in the present case, the rising oil prices are the main factor which informs the debate on the fixing of the appropriate valuation date*,\"996 the Tribunal applied to the facts of the case the approach of using information known at the date of the award which it adopted in \"*taking account of the future economics of the Project*.\"997 The Applicant's contention that, had the prices decreased instead of increased, the valuation would have been different,998 assumes that worsened business conditions, such as a fall in oil prices in the event, would have been excluded by the Tribunal from *ex post* information. The Applicant does not demonstrate that the Tribunal, who was not discussing the floor on the remedy, would have adopted such an absurd result for *ex aequo et bono* considerations notwithstanding its choice of the valuation date on the basis of an unlawful expropriation and of an increase in the value of the expropriated asset since the date of expropriation.\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 59.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 229.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 229.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 456; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 568.\n\n**D.

Venezuela clarifies that it does not request the Committee to determine the correctness of the Tribunal's conclusion that \"expropriation\" was not covered by the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions, but to assess the Tribunal's departure from the Parties' express agreement that the expropriation in this case unquestionably fell within the definition of \"Discriminatory Action.\"1001\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 319; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 170.\n\n716.\n\nVenezuela refers, among others, to the following evidence in support of its position (i) statements made in the 2016 and 2017 Hearings to the effect that the Parties agreed that the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions covered expropriation;1002 (ii) the summary of the ICC award -presented by the Conoco Parties- with the finding that the progressive expropriation of the tax incentives constituted \"Discriminatory Actions\" within the meaning of the Association Agreements; (iii) the Conoco Parties' post-hearing brief for the 2016 Hearing speak of \"Discriminatory Actions Claim\" under the Association Agreements by the ICC Claimants; and (iv) the expert reports after the 2016 Hearing, both of which assumed that the 2007 expropriation was a \"Discriminatory Action.\"1003\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 311, 312.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 312-314.\n\n717.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela also reiterates that in the ICC and ICSID arbitrations the Conoco Parties took the position that expropriation was included within the definition of \"Discriminatory Action\" in the Association Agreements.

The Tribunal also disregarded the documentary evidence showing that the basis on which the Venezuelan Congress authorized the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects was that compensation for adverse actions would be on \"equitable terms\" and not \"full compensation.\" The Tribunal also ignored witness testimony on the compensation provisions in its analysis and did not even address the annulment decision in the *Mobil* case, in circumstances that the Conoco Parties had heavily relied on the *Mobil* award.1006\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 322-329.\n\n720.\n\nVenezuela submits that the Parties had in fact agreed on the meaning of the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions, contrary to Conoco's characterization of it as a \"purported\" agreement.1007 Venezuela argues that Conoco cannot invoke *iura novit curia* to avoid the consequences of the Tribunal's failure to state reasons for disregarding the Parties' agreement.1008 Venezuela submits the meaning of the provisions was not, like Conoco maintains, a legal issue \"vigorously contested.\" The contested legal question was whether the Tribunal could consider the compensation provisions in its analysis under the Treaty, as Conoco's position was that the compensation provisions were only relevant to the contractual claims in the ICC arbitration. However, Venezuela submits that both Parties agreed that \"expropriation\" was a \"Discriminatory Action,\" and the Tribunal failed to provide any reason to explain why it ignored Parties' agreement and decided that expropriation was not a \"Discriminatory Action.\"1009\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 184.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 184.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 185-187.\n\n**D.2 Manifest Excess of Powers, Failure to State Reasons and Serious Departure as Argued by De Jes\u00fas**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n721.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal (i) manifestly exceeded its powers; (ii) failed to state reasons; and (iii) seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure regarding its findings on the issue of compensation as a result of the rights expropriated from the ConocoPhillips Dutch Companies.\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess** **R****egarding** **C****ompensation** **M****echanism***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n722.\n\nVenezuela submits that the reconstituted Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when, contrary to the clear terms of Article 9(5) of the BIT, it failed to apply the \"provisions of special agreements relating to the investments\" (*i.e.*, the provisions of the Association Agreements) and the law of the \"Contracting State concerned\" (*i.e.*, the Venezuelan Congress Authorizations) to the valuation of the compensation for the expropriation of the rights of the ConocoPhillips Dutch Companies.1010\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 372, 373; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 490.\n\n723.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal applied international law to the issue of compensation, even though it had already determined that under Article 9(5) of the BIT, \"the law of the Contracting State concerned\" and \"the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments\" were the pertinent or applicable sources of law in respect of compensation.1011\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 374, citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 178-179; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 487.\n\n724.\n\nVenezuela submits that the Tribunal found that Article 6 prevailed over any Venezuelan law on the same subject matter, yet valued the rights of the ConocoPhillips Dutch Companies and fixed compensation for expropriation pursuant to international law in a vacuum.1012 The Tribunal considered that Article 9(5) does not provide a hierarchy of the sources of law it enumerates; and that international law must prevail over domestic law, meaning that a State may not invoke its internal law to absolve itself from an international law obligation.1013 But, by doing so, the reconstituted Tribunal failed to interpret Article 9(5) pursuant to the VCLT and created a conflict of laws where there was none. The terms of Article 9(5) are clear, containing the conjunction \"and\" between each source of law it enumerates, which indicates that the sources are cumulative and were to be applied jointly if two or more were apt to cover similar issues.1014\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 377; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 491, 492.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 377, citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 85, 88.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 376; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 492.\n\n725.\n\nVenezuela submits that this failure of the Tribunal to apply the law it had identified constitutes a manifest excess of the powers, warranting annulment of the quantum sections of the Award and associated sections of the *dispositif* pursuant to Convention Article 52(1)(b).1015\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 378.\n\n726.\n\nThe manifest nature of this excess can be perceived through reading paragraphs 170 and 179-190 of the Award. At paragraph 170 of the Award, the Tribunal stated it would apply international law to value the Conoco Parties' rights, however, at paragraphs 179 and 180, it acknowledged that Venezuelan law and the Association Agreements were the proper law to apply.1016\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 494.\n\n727.\n\nVenezuela also asserts that it is contesting the application of the proper law itself; rather than merely disagreeing with the conclusion reached by the Tribunal, as Conoco claims. Also, what is relevant is whether the Tribunal specifically applied Venezuelan law and the Association Agreements to value the Conoco Parties' rights; not, like Conoco posits, that the Tribunal applied BIT Articles 9(5) and 6 in general, taking into consideration Venezuelan law and the Association Agreements.1017\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 496, 497.\n\n728.\n\nVenezuela submits the Tribunal merged into one issue: (i) the valuation of Conoco's rights subject to Venezuelan law and the Association Agreements; and (ii) the standard of compensation that is exclusively relevant to international law. At best, Venezuela claims that the Tribunal considered if the Association Agreements were such as to reshape international law standard of \"full compensation,\" but that does not equate to applying Venezuelan law and the Association Agreements to value the Conoco Parties' rights.1018\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 499.\n\n729.\n\nFurther, Venezuela submits that the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers by egregiously misapplying the Association Agreements. The Tribunal (incorrectly) decided to analyse the compensation standard in Article 6 under international law; however, it relied on the Association Agreements to fix the contour of the valuation of the ConocoPhillips Dutch Companies' rights in the Projects. The Petrozuata and the Hamaca Association Agreements had compensation provisions limiting compensation to be granted through a price cap mechanism for measures included in the contractual definitions of \"Discriminatory Actions.\"1019\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 390-395.\n\n730.\n\nRelying on arguments made during the 2016 and the 2017 Hearings, Venezuela submits that the Parties agreed that \"expropriation\" is a \"Discriminatory Action.\" Venezuela also relies on the finding of the ICC tribunal that expropriation was a \"Discriminatory Action\" under either Association Agreement. Also, the compensation provisions expressly mention \"expropriation\" (for Hamaca) and any governmental action (for Petrozuata). Nevertheless, the Tribunal determined that expropriation was not a \"Discriminatory Action\" under the Association Agreements. Venezuela argues that this constitutes an egregious error of law, equivalent to failure to apply the law, and therefore amounts to a manifest excess of powers.1020\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 389-405; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 520, 521.\n\n731.\n\nVenezuela counters Conoco's defence on this point arguing that the issue is not if the Tribunal had the power to exercise independent judgment on whether the compensation clauses governed the 2007 taking, but rather whether the Tribunal's use of that power passed the \"failure-to-apply-the-law\" test of Convention Article 52(1)(b).1021 Additionally, contrary to Conoco's contention, the failure to apply the law was significant; the Tribunal never made the alternative determination posited by Conoco, namely, that even if the expropriation had been a \"Discriminatory Action,\" the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions do not represent an exclusive remedy.1022\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 525.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 527, 528.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons** **R****egarding the** **C****ompensation** **M****echanism***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n732.\n\nEven if the Committee finds that the Tribunal's application of international law to the issue of compensation is not subject to annulment, the quantum sections must still be annulled due to the Tribunal's contradictory reasoning regarding compensation. The Tribunal found that international law prevailed over domestic law and, thereby, it governed the issue of compensation, it however selectively applied cherry-picked provisions from the Association Agreements and Venezuelan law (specifically, the Venezuelan Congress Authorizations), to assess the Windfall Profits Tax. One cannot follow from Point A (international law applies and not the Venezuelan Congress Authorizations) to Point B (application of international law and certain provisions of Venezuelan law). This warrants annulment of the Award's quantum sections in relation to the issue of compensation.1023\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 380-388; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 502, 503.\n\n733.\n\nVenezuela submits, contrary to Conoco, that the Tribunal's reasoning did not follow from Venezuela's own argumentation in the arbitration. Venezuela's position, as Prof. Abi-Saab noted in his dissent, focused on the fact that the provisions of the Association Agreements impacted the \"market value\" (BIT Article 6) of Conoco's rights. However, , this does not explain *why* the Tribunal selectively applied the Association Agreements and the Congressional Authorization to a specific sub-issue as the Windfall Profits Tax but chose not to do so in relation to the Conoco Parties' expropriation claim.1024\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 504-506.\n\n734.\n\nVenezuela also argues failure to state reasons for the Tribunal's decision that expropriation was not a \"Discriminatory Action\" within the meaning of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements. Venezuela characterizes the two paragraphs in which the Tribunal devoted to exclude expropriation from the definition of \"Discriminatory Actions\" as \"lapidary.\" These paragraphs neither analyse the terms included in the \"Discriminatory Actions,\" which for the Hamaca project expressly includes the term \"expropriation,\" nor refer to any pre-contractual documentation the Parties provided.1025\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 405-410; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 523, 530.\n\n735.\n\nVenezuela argues that the only reasons the Tribunal gave for excluding the expropriation from the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements are conclusory. Regarding the Petrozuata Agreement, the Tribunal postulated that the compensation provision applied only to a \"Development Decision\" while an expropriation, including the 2007 taking, was not a \"Development Decision.\" This reason is not sufficient nor adequate, as no reader can understand how \"Development Decision\" in the Petrozuata Agreement could be relevant to determine whether an expropriation constitutes a governmental action under the the same provision.1026 For Hamaca, the Tribunal circumvented the facts that the compensation provision expressly refers to \"expropriation,\" that the Parties agreed that the 2007 taking fell under the compensation provision of the Hamaca agreement and that the ICC tribunal had confirmed this to that extent. The Tribunal did not explain why, while acknowledging that the compensation provisions referred to \"expropriation,\" it considered that this term included \"*only assets or interests as part of the Association\"* and not *\"the entire Project governed by the Association Agreement*.\"1027\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 522.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 523.\n\n736.\n\nFinally, Venezuela also argues that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons its decision not to accept the ICC evidence in the record and to ascribe no probative value to evidence to which it had already been privy.1028 Venezuela notes that, only a few days after receiving the transcript, the Tribunal notified the Parties of its decision, without providing any reasons either at that time or later when the it rendered the Award. For Venezuela, the only logical conclusion for such omission is that the decision was arbitrary and, as such, subject to annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(e).\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 422; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 522.\n\n***S****erious** **D****eparture** **F****rom a** **F****undamental** **R****ule of** **P****rocedure** **R****egarding the** **C****ompensation** **M****echanism***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n737.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, when it decided not to accept in the record the ICC evidence, including the ICC award, against the Parties' agreement as to the evidentiary weight to be accorded. In Venezuela's view the value of the ICC Award in the ICSID arbitration was undeniable, considering that the ICC tribunal was the appropriate forum for the determination of what constituted an expropriation under the definition of \"Discriminatory Actions\" in the Association Agreements. The Tribunal's decision to not allow the Parties to produce evidence they both considered relevant deprived them of their fundamental right to be heard.1029 Venezuela submits the departure prevented Venezuela from producing the ICC hearing transcripts in support of its Brief on Quantum and making arguments in relation to the ICC arbitration in its brief.1030\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 412-422.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 538.\n\n738.\n\nVenezuela contends that the Tribunal arbitrarily denied its right to present freely the documents it deemed relevant to support its position on the Association Agreements. Therefore, Venezuela argues, that Conoco's assertion that Venezuela had several occasions to present its case on the Association Agreements and the \"Discriminatory Action\" is irrelevant.1031\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 542, 543.\n\n739.\n\nAdditionally, in accordance with the test under Convention Article 52(1)(d), the departure of the Tribunal was serious as it potentially affected the Award. Venezuela submits that it is likely the Tribunal could have reached a different conclusion had it considered the analysis of the Association Agreements on the notion of \"Discriminatory Action\" made by the ICC tribunal.1032\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 544.\n\n**D.3 No Manifest Excess of Powers, No Failure to State Reasons and No Serious Departure as Argued by Conoco**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***N****o** **M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n740.\n\nConoco argues that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers in its findings on the \"Discrimination Action\" provisions. The Tribunal examined and applied Article 9(5) of the BIT and determined that the compensation standard for expropriation was governed by the BIT and international law, while the Claimants' rights under the Association Agreements were governed by Venezuelan law. The Tribunal concluded that the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions were not the only remedy available in case of nationalization and did not limit the compensation that could be awarded by the Tribunal against a different party under a different non-contractual cause of action in international law. Venezuela's challenge to the Tribunal's treatment of the applicable law or the relevance of the Association Agreements' \"Discriminatory Action\" provision is meritless and not a valid ground for annulment.1033\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 386-390; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 107, 94.\n\n741.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco argues that the Tribunal identified and applied the correct law. Venezuela's complaint that the Tribunal either did not apply the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions or failed to consider them is defeated by Venezuela's observation that the Tribunal \"increase[ed] compensation for the Petrozuata Project by \u2026 apply[ing] the compensation provisions for that Project.\"1034 Venezuela's real complaint, according to Conoco, is that the Tribunal did not apply the compensation provisions the way it preferred.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 100(a), citing Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 371.\n\n742.\n\nNeither did the Tribunal manifestly exceed its powers in the way it treated the *Mobil* annulment decision. The *Mobil ad hoc* committee annulled nine paragraphs of the *Mobil* award relating to the determination of the amount of compensation. The *Mobil* committee found that the *Mobil* tribunal had failed to take into account the relevant compensation provisions of Mobil's association agreements in awarding compensation under the BIT. Importantly, the *Mobil* committee acknowledged that it was beyond its competence to determine in that case the substantive question of the relevance of the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions on the compensation owing under international law. In the present case, however, the Tribunal did consider the effect of the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions on an award for compensation under the Treaty. In the arbitration, the Parties addressed the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions in numerous written submissions, at four oral hearings, and the Tribunal devoted seven pages of the Award to identifying and applying the law, including the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions.1035\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 391-394.\n\n743.\n\nConoco also argues that the Tribunal did not exceed the Parties' mandate by making its own determination on the relevance of the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions to compensation under the BIT. Based on the principle of *iura novit curia*, the Tribunal was empowered to ascertain the content and application of the applicable law, not being bound by the parties' pleading and arguments. Conoco submits that the question as to what effect, if any, the \"Discrimination Action\" provisions have on the compensation available under the BIT was a contentious point of law (not fact) between the Parties. The Tribunal was persuaded by Conoco's position, that the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions did not impose a cap on the compensation owed for Venezuela's breach of the BIT. In making its determination, the Tribunal afforded the Parties the opportunity to address the issue at the hearings held in August 2016, February 2017, and March 2017.1036\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 395-399, 406; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 100(b).\n\n744.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco notes that Venezuela (Curtis) was unable to marshal a single authority for the proposition that a tribunal manifestly exceeds its powers when it arrives at its conclusion on a question law. Conoco argues that the interpretation of the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions was a question of law, not fact, and the authorities on which Venezuela relies are inapposite.1037 Conoco also argues that in the present case, the Tribunal's powers flow from the arbitration clause in the BIT, the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, and the Tribunal did not exercise its powers beyond these instruments.1038 Moreover, Conoco notes that in the underlying proceeding, it had addressed at length the effect of the \"Discriminatory Action\" provision on their international law claim, arguing that it did not limit their entitlement to compensation under international law. Conoco also notes that Venezuela had also thoroughly addressed whether expropriation constituted a \"Discriminatory Action\" within the meaning of the Association Agreements.1039\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 118.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), 123.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 124, 125.\n\n745.\n\nConoco submits that even if, *arguendo*, the Tribunal misapplied the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions, the Committee would have no basis to annul the Award. The Tribunal's conclusion remains valid unless it is so untenable that it cannot be supported by reasonable arguments -which is not the case here. Further, Venezuela's complaint is inconsequential, and the Award remains valid because the Tribunal made clear that even if it had concluded that the expropriation was a \"Discriminatory Action\" it would not have accepted Venezuela's attempt to limit the compensation under the BIT.1040 The Tribunal specifically held that the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions were not an exclusive remedy and that they \"offered an additional layer of protection;\"1041 Claimants had rights under both domestic and international law. The Tribunal found that the Claimants had not waived their \"international law rights\" or \"rights contained in the BIT\" by their participation in the Projects.1042\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 408-411.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 137, citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 940.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 133, citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 183.\n\n746.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco rebuts Venezuela's (De Jes\u00fas) argument that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by egregiously misapplying the Association Agreements. Conoco argues that Venezuela's disagreement with the Tribunal's interpretation of specific provisions in the Association Agreements does not constitute a ground for annulment. Venezuela is asking the Committee to reopen the merits of the Tribunal's decision on the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions, when incorrect application of the law is not a ground for annulment.1043\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 140, 141.\n\n***N****o** **F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n747.\n\nConoco submits that the Tribunal gave extensive reasoning at paragraphs 160 to 175 of the Award for its conclusion that the expropriation does not constitute a \"Discriminatory Action.\" The Tribunal's reasonings were readily comprehensible, internally consistent and flowed directly from its evaluation of the express terms of the Association Agreements. Venezuela's disagreement with the result of these reasonings does not mean that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons.1044\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 412-416.\n\n748.\n\nConoco also maintains that the Tribunal did refer to the evidence on which were Venezuela relied regarding pre-contractual negotiations, specifically at paragraphs 113 to 139 of the Award. The Tribunal also explained why consideration of Venezuela's pre-contractual negotiation evidence was irrelevant to its analysis.1045\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 417.\n\n749.\n\nFurther, Conoco submits that Venezuela's argument that the Tribunal allegedly failed to address the annulment decision in *Mobil* is irrelevant. The Tribunal was neither bound by that decision, nor was it required to discuss it, particularly as the decision did not address the merits of the issue before the Tribunal.1046\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 418.\n\n750.\n\nAdditionally, Conoco submits that there was no contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning to resort to Venezuelan law on the issue of the Windfall Profits Tax. The Tribunal determined that international law applied to the BIT claim, establishing the compensation standard of \"full compensation\" while the Association Agreements and Venezuelan law were relevant to determining what constituted \"full compensation\" under international law for the expropriated national law rights. In short, the Tribunal did not hold that international law applied exclusively, but rather that different laws applied to different aspects of the case.1047\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 420, 421; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 146.\n\n751.\n\nFinally, Conoco notes that the Tribunal afforded Parties ample opportunities to make submissions on the relevance of the ICC arbitration and allowed them to submit evidence from the ICC arbitration, including the valuation reports filed therein. Conoco recounts instances in which the Tribunal invited the Parties to inform the Tribunal about the ICC arbitration, including an invitation to submit a list of documents, mentioned in the ICC transcripts, on which they wished to rely. Conoco explains that given that the Tribunal concluded that the expropriation was not a \"Discriminatory Action,\" the Tribunal saw no need to give any evidentiary weight to the material from the ICC arbitration. Conoco maintains that *ad-hoc* committees have no power to review a Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence.1048\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 422; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 153.\n\n752.\n\nIn its Rejoinder Conoco rebuts Venezuela's (Curtis) argument that the Tribunal was bound by the ICC award because of collateral estoppel. Conoco argues that this was a fresh argument that had not been argued before by Venezuela, furthermore, none of the elements for the application of the doctrine are met. In addition, Conoco argues that the ICC arbitration involved different parties and different claims under different governing law.1049\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 154.\n\n***N****o** **S****erious** **D****eparture** **F****rom a** **F****undamental** **R****ule of** **P****rocedure** **R****egarding the** **C****ompensation** **M****echanism***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n753.\n\nThe Tribunal did not seriously depart from a fundamental rule of procedure by receiving the ICC record for information only. Venezuela has failed to show that there was a departure from the procedure, let alone one that is serious. The Tribunal received various documents from the ICC procedure, including the valuation reports, the hearing transcript and the ICC award. The Tribunal allowed Parties the opportunity to comment on the impact, if any, the ICC proceedings would have on the ICSID arbitration. Conoco notes that the ICC proceeding was with different parties than those in the ICSID case. In any event, the Tribunal was not bound to assign any specific value to the ICC record.1050\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 424-428.\n\n754.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco notes that: (i) by the time the ICC award was rendered, the underlying arbitration had been pending for a decade, and Parties had ample opportunity to present arguments and evidence regarding the relevance of the \"Discriminatory Action\" provisions during the underlying arbitration proceeding (ii) the Parties had the opportunity to comment on whether expropriation constituted a \"Discriminatory Action\" within the meaning of the Association Agreements; (iii) the ICC award was not binding on the Tribunal, and the Tribunal would have committed an error susceptible to annulment if it had abdicated its decision-making authority to the ICC tribunal; (iv) in the arbitration Venezuela agreed that no new documents should be admitted after 15 April 2016, unless the Tribunal granted leave; and (v) before the issuance of the Award, Venezuela never objected to the Tribunal's decision to not allow the ICC award into the record on some broader or different basis.1051\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 158.\n\n***D.4.

The Association Agreements established a compensation mechanism arising from any Discriminatory Action against the State's sovereign right to regulate and legislate the Project.1052 It is not the Treaty's function to change the terms freely agreed upon by investors under the laws under which the investment was created.1053 The Applicant argues that, by failing to apply Venezuelan law, the special agreements on compensation applicable to the Upgrading Projects and international law, the Tribunal failed apply Article 9(5) of the Treaty1054 which prescribes that the applicable law should be the national law of the host State, the provisions of the Treaty and the general principles of law.1055\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 159-164, 224-228, 289.

The Tribunal considered Article 9 in deciding the applicable law governing the available remedy. It recognized that \"*international law does not prevail over national law in a matter not governed by international law in which case national law may apply, in accordance with Article 9(5) of the BIT*\". It asked itself the following questions regarding the \"*much debated issue*\" of the relevance of the compensation provisions in determining the remedies for the Projects expropriation: \"*Are these provisions capable of governing the effects of an expropriation of the participants' assets held in the Projects? Or are these provisions relevant to the determination of the assets subject to such an expropriation when considered in the framework of Article 6 of the BIT?*\"1056 In light of the terms and purposes of the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements, the Tribunal refuted Venezuela's arguments that they govern the economic consequences of the 26 June 2007 expropriation.1057 However, the Tribunal agreed with Venezuela \"*that 'the issue before this Tribunal is not to determine whether the Association Agreements have been breached, but whether the compensation mechanisms established pursuant to the Congressional Authorizations as conditions to entering into the upgrading Projects are relevant in determining quantum*.*'\"*1058 To answer that question, the Tribunal clarified that full reparation cannot represent more than compensation of the rights and assets held by the investor under the Association Agreements governed by Venezuelan law. By accepting their investment through the Association Agreements and the Congressional Authorizations on which they are based, ConocoPhillips acquired the rights contained in these instruments, along with the investment protection embedded in the Treaty. While the protection of the investors' rights is governed by the Treaty, the Tribunal decided that the content is determined by the Association Agreements governed by the laws of Venezuela.1059\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award,* \u00b6\u00b6 71, 89.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award,* \u00b6 171.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award,* \u00b6 178.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 180, 183.\n\n757.\n\nThe Applicant puts forward the annulment decision in the *Mobil* case to suggest that it is indisputable that when a bundle of rights in relation to the investment was created under Venezuelan law, it became a type of property protected by international law in the form of the Treaty.1060\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 308-309 (*Venezuela Holdings Decision on Annulment*).\n\n758.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis matches up so far with Venezuela's recognition that if certain issues are governed by international law, this does not mean that considerations of national law or the special agreements entered regarding the investment would not be allowed, such as expropriation affecting property rights which are defined by the local law under which they were created.1061\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award,* \u00b6 140; Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 387.

Further, the investors entered into the projects with \"*eyes wide open*,\" accepting the limitations on compensation that were not imposed by Venezuela after the investment was made.1063 The Applicant disputes the following passage of the Award: \"*One important factor of hierarchy is the principle that international law must prevail over domestic law, and that a State may not invoke its internal law to extract itself from an international law obligation. As a matter of principle, this is not disputed between the Parties, nor is there any controversy that such principle results from the international law itself and not from Article 9(5) of the BIT*.\"1064 The Applicant also points to ConocoPhillips' position on Article 9 in supporting the application of international law, which states that \"[s] *tate responsibility entails a secondary obligation of full reparation. This principle was codified in Article 32 of the ILC Articles*.\"1065\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 306; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 153.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 165-166, 306 (footnote 615); Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 153.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 88.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Award*, \u00b6 76 (Article 32 ILC (Irrelevance of internal law)).\n\n760.\n\nConocoPhillips relied on the same arguments in the *Mobil v. Venezuela* ICSID arbitration in support of their contention that the compensation provisions were not relevant to their Treaty claim.1066 In the present case, the Tribunal did not apply international law to the standard of compensation because the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements could not exempt or excuse Venezuela from its international obligation under the Treaty, but decided that the expropriation of 26 June 2007 could not be a Discriminatory Action within the meaning such term has in the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements.1067\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 270- 273.

The answer depends on whether the Tribunal decided beyond the scope of the Parties' request and, if so, on which ground.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 399.\n\n763.\n\nThe Applicant stresses that ConocoPhillips agreed with PDVSA in the ICC arbitration and with Venezuela in the underlying ICSID arbitration that expropriation was included within the definition of Discriminatory Action, as noted by the Tribunal at paragraph 173 in the Award.1070 As evidence of an agreement, the Applicant relies on a dialogue between the Parties' counsel at the two hearings on quantum in August 2016 and March 2017 on which the Parties' experts proceeded thereafter for their calculations.1071The August 2016 Hearing transcripts make apparent Venezuela's counsel declaration regarding the Parties' \"*agreement that expropriation is within the scope of the Discriminatory Action Clauses of the Association Agreement*.\"1072 The transcripts also make apparent that the purported agreement cannot be attributed the role which the Applicant wishes it to play in the circumstances. At the August 2016 Hearing, ConocoPhillips' representatives retorted that the extent to which Venezuela's statement could be considered correct was in the understanding that the Discriminatory Action provisions were not the exclusive remedy.1073 When at the March 2017 hearing, the Tribunal again raised the question whether the expropriation is governed by the compensation provisions , ConocoPhillips' counsel answered in the negative, explaining that the expropriation claim was not governed by the Discriminatory Action mechanism because the legal basis is different.1074 When ConocoPhillips was again asked whether it maintained that the expropriation came under the scope of the compensation provisions, its response dispelled any ambiguity: it considered that, while expropriation qualifies as a Discriminatory Action only insofar as it entitles it to an additional layer of compensation from PDVSA, \"*that does not in any way inhibit the remedy that is seekable against the State itself without limit*\" and \"*that the DA mechanism is not the exclusive remedy in those circumstances* [\u2026] *which [\u2026] on their terms make clear that there is another remedy*.\"1075\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 157-163, 165, 180.

Day 2, p. 169: 14-25.\n\n765.\n\nThe Committee turns now to ConocoPhillips' argument that the contractual mechanism is an additional layer of protection against PDVSA, not limiting compensation against Venezuela under the Treaty for Discriminatory Action.1078\n\nIncluding from De Jes\u00fas, see Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 527, 528.\n\n766.\n\nConocoPhillips submits that even if the Tribunal had found that the expropriation of 26 June 2007 was a Discriminatory Action and that the contractual clauses apply, these contractual clauses could not, as a non-exclusive contractual mechanism, constitute a cap on the investor's international rights unless ConocoPhillips waives remedy under international law and the Treaty,1079 which it did not.1080 ConocoPhillips states that its analysis was endorsed by the Tribunal, which concluded that even if the expropriation was a Discriminatory Action, the Applicant's complaint would be inconsequential.1081\n\nTr.

In the Committee's view, the Applicant's proposition is more akin to an appeal against the Tribunal's legal characterization of the compensation provisions as a non-exclusive remedy. In any case, this challenge remains moot, as it would only need to be considered if the Tribunal found that the application of the compensation mechanisms was contrary to the Parties' agreement.\n\nTr. Day 3 p. 41:8-14.\n\n768.\n\nThe Committee returns to the extract from paragraph 173 of the Award on the existence of a Parties' agreement on compensation, relied on by the Applicant, which is reproduced as follows:\n\n\"*The Respondent further confirmed that this means that the compensation provisions apply to the expropriation 'in this case' \u2013 this meaning 'exclusively'. This position does not reflect the Claimants' claim in the present case. It can only relate to the dispute brought before the ICC Arbitration Tribunal. It is of no concern in the present case.[\u2026] where the expropriation at the origin of the dispute is the single taking of 26 June 2007 which led the Claimants to claim for a breach of Article 6 of the BIT*.\"1083\n\nNotwithstanding the Applicant's affirmation of an agreement,1084 it appears from the ICC Award that PDVSA only admitted that Expropriation constituted a Discriminatory Action to refute ConocoPhillips' Overall Expropriation (comprised of the Royalty Measure, the Extraction Tax and the Expropriation which progressively affected the value of the Projects) Discriminatory Action claim.1085 The cumulative effect of which was regarded by ConocoPhillips in the ICC arbitration as equivalent to an indirect or creeping expropriation, and the Tribunal at paragraph 173 noted that \"*whether the compensation provisions would govern an expropriation different from the one enforced through a single taking on 26 June 2007, consisting of an agglomerate of a number of Governmental actions, to be qualified together as Discriminatory Action, while certain components would, as such, not meet the conditions set forth in the pertinent definition*.\"\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 173.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 316-317.\n\n**A/R-17 [Curtis] / A/R-58 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Phillips Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited and ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. v.

The Applicant argues that having acknowledged the principles that property rights are created under domestic law and only protected under international law, as well as that compensation is unavailable for rights that were never owned or that exceeded those rights, the Tribunal should have upheld the terms and conditions agreed upon the Upgrading Projects investments, including the compensation provisions.1087\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 323, 324; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 186, 187.

Having noted that the relevance of the compensation agreements goes to the heart of the question of the limitations of the priority of international law over national law,1088 the Tribunal determined that, irrespective of whether the standard of compensation is \"just compensation\" under Article 6(c) of the Treaty or \"full\" reparation under customary international law, the investor's rights and their contents are based on the Association Agreements and governed by Venezuelan law. Their compensation provisions are relevant for determining quantum to the extent that the government measure meets the requirements for their application; such is so with regard to the Windfall Profits Tax. However, the Tribunal found that expropriation is not a Discriminatory Action within the meaning of the compensation provisions.1089 The Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal set out how and why it reached its decision and what the decision was. The requirement under Article 52(1)(e) does not extend to reasons for the reasons.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 89.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 171-175, 179-180, 184, 188.\n\n772.\n\nAside from a general attack on the reasons adopted by the Tribunal, the Applicant specifically denounced as \"nonsensical\" and as exemplifying both a failure to state reasons and a manifest excess of power, the statement in paragraph 176 of the Award that: \"*The Investment Law must prevail over the Association Agreements in the hypothesis that one would consider that these Agreements would govern the effects of their own expropriation*.\"1090 The sentence is about the role of the Venezuelan Investment Law at paragraph 176, where the Tribunal appreciated that Venezuela denied that the Investment Law had any role to play in respect of the 2007 expropriation since it appeared to be correct that the Conoco Parties were not subject to it. The Tribunal, however, reserved a prevailing role of the Investment Law for the joint ventures operating the Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro Projects as entities receiving the investment in the above hypothesis.1091 Whatever the correctness of the Tribunal's deduction, the Applicant has not explained the consequences of the hypothetical application considered for the joint ventures heading each of the three Projects, including the Corocoro Project whose Association Agreement has no compensation provisions,1092 on the Tribunal's approach of the Discriminatory Action provisions of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements for setting the standard of compensation regarding the Upgrading Projects. This apart, the Applicant does not address any particular defects in the above reasoning on the relevance of the compensation provisions other than the general insufficiency of it which would also give rise to a manifest excess of power.1093 Reasons are required to permit the reader to observe what the Tribunal has done or not done to apply the proper law and more generally comply with the prohibition of manifest excess of power.1094 The reasons provided by the Tribunal offer such an explanation.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 176.

However, the joint ventures conducting each of the three Projects were in the opposite position. It has been explained by the Respondent in the jurisdictional phase of this proceeding that pursuant to Article 5 of Decree No. 1.867 of 11 July 2002 on Investment Law Regulation the three joint ventures heading each of the three Projects were to be considered as entities receiving the investment (empresa receptora de la inversion). These entities were therefore holding investments 'owned by or actually controlled by a Venezuelan or foreign individual or legal entity' and thus subject to the Investment Law (Art. 3, last and sole paragraph \u2013 R-12).

The compensation provisions of the Upgrading Projects were not excluded by the Tribunal because the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements cannot excuse or exempt Venezuela from its obligations under the Treaty or international law but because the Tribunal interpreted the terms and purposes of the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements as not applicable to the expropriation of 26 June 2007 which did not come within the meaning of Discriminatory Action.1112\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 376.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that the BIT has to be interpreted in light of its rules of interpretation, and more particularly the systemic integration rule of Article 31(3)(c) to take account of the relevant rules of international law (**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 91).\n\nTr Day 1, p. 26: 18-25, p. 27: 1-4; p. 119: 7-22.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 171-175.\n\n777.\n\nWe summarise here the Tribunal's decision on the standard of compensation. The Tribunal first noted that a breach of Article 6 of the Treaty and compensation therefore are only defined by this provision notwithstanding the applicable standard under domestic law.1113 The Tribunal also noted that if ConocoPhillips' claim for compensation was governed by the compensation provision of the Association Agreements instead of Article 6 of the Treaty, it would be covered by the arbitration clauses in those Agreements.1114 The Applicant identifies a \"*second straw man*\" for not bringing the compensation clauses because the Association Agreements are entered between ConocoPhillips and PDVSA and not with Venezuela, which introduces into the discussion the notion of contract claim/treaty claim that has no place at all.1115 The Committee notes, however, that the Tribunal does not relate the application of international law to the ICSID arbitration agreement in the Treaty. Instead, the Award states that, notwithstanding the absence of any claim based on the Association Agreements provisions before the ICSID Tribunal, this \"*does not mean that these provisions are irrelevant for this Tribunal's ruling on the consequences of the expropriation that breached Article 6(c)*\".1116 The Tribunal held relevant the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements in determining quantum to the extent that a particular governmental measure meets the requirement for their application, because international sources of law cannot govern exclusively the determination and amount of compensation which reflects a value corresponding to the loss suffered by those whose rights affected by the expropriation are based on the Association Agreements.1117\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 169-170.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 169, 177.\n\nTr Day 1, p. 49: 22-25, p. 50: 1-4.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 177.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 177, 179-180, 184.\n\n778.\n\nThe Applicant recognizes that the Tribunal correctly identified, but failed to apply, the applicable rules of law at para. 179 of the Award where it stated that \"*the Respondent submits correctly that Article 9(5) of the BIT has to be given full effect when it refers to 'the law of the Contracting State concerned' and to \u2026the Association Agreements and related provisions of the laws of Venezuela. None of the other sources of law enumerated in Article 9(5) are pertinent or applicable in this respect*.\"1118\n\nTr Day 1, pp. 119:2-10.\n\n779.\n\nThe challenge of a tribunal's choice between the applicable rules of the proper law raises the question of the demarcation line between annulment and appeal. In this case, the Tribunal has not excluded any of the rules designated by Article 9(5) from the determination of the law governing remedy. The Applicant's attack is against the combination made of these rules and the proportion in which they govern the issue of compensation of the 26 June 2007 expropriation. The challenge is directed at how and in which manner the Tribunal applied the components of the proper law. This is very different from a partial application of the proper law having the same consequences as total non-application. Under the guise of a failure to apply Venezuelan law,1119 the Applicant discusses how the Tribunal exercised its judgment regarding the applicability of the contractual compensation mechanism of the Association Agreements in respect of expropriation. The irrelevance of the compensation provisions to expropriation which does not come within the meaning of discriminatory action is not tantamount to a failure to apply Venezuelan law as the governing law of the Association Agreements in which they are embedded and to apply the provisions of these Agreements.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 371.\n\n780.\n\nThe Committee turns then to the Applicant's claim regarding an egregious misapplication of the law tantamount to a failure to apply the law and on a failure to give reasons regarding the Tribunal's decision to exclude expropriation from the scope of the Discriminatory Actions while it recognized the importance of the Association Agreements in the determination of compensation.1120\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 392, 403-405; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 521, 522.\n\n781.\n\nThe Applicant alleges at first that the Tribunal distorted the Parties' agreement that the 2007 expropriation fell under the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements and disregarded the ICC award which decided at odds with its interpretation of the provisions but was not given probative value.1121 The Committee cannot find in the extracts of the exchanges between the Parties and the Tribunal at the 2016 and 2017 Hearings on quantum any agreement as alluded to by the Applicant1122 in light of ConocoPhillips counsel's repeated opposition to consider that their expropriation claim is governed by the Discriminatory Action mechanism.1123 Neither can it be concluded that the Tribunal disregarded the ICC award.1124 The Tribunal considered the role of the ICC award regarding ConocoPhillips' purported agreement to the application of the compensation provisions to expropriation as relating to the dispute brought before the ICC tribunal which is of no concern in the present case where the expropriation governs an expropriation enforced through a single taking on 26 June 2007 and not one consisting of an agglomerate number of governmental actions to qualify as Discriminatory Action.1125\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 402, 408; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 516, 520, 522.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 515 (footnote no. 668), 521 (footnote no. 678).\n\n**A/R-93 [Curtis] / A/R-134 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *March 2017 Hearing*, pp. 4514: 18 - 4515: 11.\n\n**A/R-17 [Curtis] / A/R-58 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Conoco ICC Final Award*.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 173.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n782.\n\nThe Committee examines the Applicant's further grievance concerning the impossibility to follow the Tribunal's reasoning on compensation due to the two following contradictory statements identified as para. 170:\n\n\"*Moreover, the Tribunal observes that the application of Article 6 of the BIT to the present dispute prevails over any Venezuelan domestic law on the same subject matter. A breach of Article 6 of the BIT is defined solely by this provision without any consideration of the domestic law of the host State. The same principle must necessarily apply to the compensation due as a consequence of an expropriation, notwithstanding what the applicable standard may be under domestic law. The standard of the BIT prevails over any standard the host State may claim to be applicable under its national law*.\"1126\n\nand para. 179:\n\n\"*Irrespective of whether the standard of compensation is 'just compensation' under Article 6(c) of the BIT or 'full' reparation based on customary international law, both sources of law cannot govern exclusively the determination of the compensation and its amount. In one way or the other, compensation reflects a value corresponding to the loss suffered by those whose rights are affected by the expropriation.*\"1127\n\nwhich it says give no reasons for first postulating that Venezuelan law and the Association Agreements did not have to be considered for determining the contours of just compensation and taking after the contradictory view that Venezuelan law and the Association Agreements needed to be considered to determine what full compensation meant in the case.1128\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 170.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 179.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 502-503.\n\n783.\n\nThe Tribunal's reasons lie in the developments found in between the two above passages selected by the Applicant which explain why and how the Tribunal came to its decision. The Committee recalls that the Tribunal admitted that application of the Treaty standard of compensation did not make the provisions of the Association Agreements irrelevant for ruling on the consequences of the expropriation conducted in breach of Article 6(c) of the Treaty.1129 More particularly, the Tribunal deemed as correctly framed, Venezuela's question as to whether the compensation mechanisms established pursuant to the Congressional Authorizations as conditions to entering into the Upgrading Projects are relevant in determining quantum for the bundle of rights which have been taken away by the expropriation.1130 The Tribunal's explanation on how international law cannot govern exclusively the determination of compensation and its amount would be better understood in reading the impugned passage of para. 179 of the Award in its entirety with what follows the above quotation which dispels any lack of clarity as to the role of national law:\n\n\"*These rights are not determined and have not been acquired on the basis of either Article 6 of the BIT or general or customary international law. These are rights, mostly rights in rem or based on contractual undertakings that have been created and are held under national law. In this respect, the Respondent submits correctly that Article 9(5) of the BIT has to be given full effect when it refers to 'the law of the Contracting State concerned' and to 'the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments', thus relying upon the provisions of the Association Agreements and related provisions of the laws of Venezuela. None of the other sources of law enumerated in Article 9(5) are pertinent or applicable in this respect.*\"1131\n\nThe Tribunal gave reasons on how it applied the different parts of the proper law to the question of the standard of compensation and to the determination of the substance of the expropriated rights in a manner which permits to understand the relation between paras. 170 and 1791132 before concluding:\n\n\"*In other words, 'full compensation', as the term is frequently used by the Claimants, cannot represent more than compensation of the rights and assets held by the Claimants at the relevant time and including revenues deriving therefrom in the future to an extent yet to be determined.

The Tribunal explained why expropriation of the Project cannot be a Discriminatory Action within the meaning of such term in the compensation provisions.1140 Under the Petrozuata Association Agreement, Discriminatory Action, inasmuch as it should follow a Development Decision, cannot mean expropriation.1141 Under the Hamaca Association Agreement, Discriminatory Action which affects net cash flow supposes that the project has not ceased to exist.1142 The payment provisions make sense only in case of the Projects' continued existence.1143 The language of the Hamaca compensation provisions referring to expropriation of a party's assets or interests as part of the Association cannot include the entire Project because it is necessarily based on the existence of an on-going Project and consequently completely incompatible with its taking by the Government through an expropriation of the totality of the investor's rights such as the taking of 26 June 2007.1144 The Tribunal finally noted that the Association Agreements were terminated on the expropriation date and ConocoPhillips' rights held through the Association Agreements including those contained in the compensation provisions were extinguished.1145 It is possible to agree or disagree with the Tribunal's analysis and reasons.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 405-407; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 517-519.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 375-378.\n\n\"*For Petrozuata, such Discriminatory Action should follow a 'Development Decision' (Sec. 1.01); such a decision has nothing in common with an expropriation*\" (**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 171).\n\n\"*For Hamaca, such Action must be 'applicable to the Association' (Sec. 14.1(b)) and affect net cash flow (Sec. 14.2(a)); the cash is no longer flowing when the Project ceases to exist* [\u2026]\" (**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 171).\n\n\"*In the case of Petrozuata, the compensation is paid through the provision of dividends, or out of general funds accumulating payments differed for later (Sec. 9.07)*. (**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 171).  \n\"*In the case of Hamaca, the notification by the foreign party of a material adverse effect caused by a Discriminatory Action is followed by negotiations directed toward the agreement of amendments to the parties' relation, which is therefore considered as being ongoing (Sec. 14.3(c)). If the affected party's claim is not withdrawn, its damages are to be paid out of Corpoven Sub's net cash flow from the Project (Sec. 14.5(a/1)) which therefore continues to exist. In case the parties were unable to agree upon modified terms of their agreement or to accept an arbitral decision, a by-out had to be triggered; however, in the case of an expropriation, the shares to be sold no longer exist*\" (**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Award*, \u00b6 171).\n\n\"*The Hamaca compensation provision refers, indeed, to 'the expropriation of the assets of, or a Party's interest in, the Association or Association Entities' (Sec. 14.1(b/1)). However, these terms include only assets or interests as part of the Association. This expression, not contained in the Petrozuata Agreement, does not include the entire Project governed by the Association Agreement. Finally, the buy-out regime of the Association Agreement is based necessarily on the existence of an on-going Project, and completely incompatible with its taking by the Government through an expropriation*\" (**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 172).\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 175. Tr. Day 2, pp. 157-158:1-22.\n\n786.\n\nThe Applicant asserts that the reasons are not a legal demonstration but it has no argument as to how the foregoing would be a distortion of the clear text of the Discriminatory Actions provisions which would not need interpretation.1146 This would be contradictory with Venezuela's position in the underlying arbitration where it admitted that the drafting of the compensation provisions is not a model of clarity.1147 Interpretation falls within the exclusive province of the Tribunal as interpretative errors do not give rise to a manifest excess of power. Parties agree to have arbitrators interpret their agreements and their decisions, even arguably construing or applying contractual provisions, must stand regardless of an *ad hoc* committee's views of their merits or demerits. Explanations at length are unnecessary as the Applicant and as the itself concedes, the Tribunal's interpretation is an error of law which is distinct from non-application of the proper law.1148\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 516, 522.\n\n**A/C-140 / A/R-91 [Curtis] / A/R-132 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Transcript of the Hearing on Quantum held 19-21 September 2017, pp. 5263:22, 5264: 1.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 392, 408.\n\n787.\n\nThe Applicant's last contentions regarding defective reasons challenge the extent of the legal reasoning provided in a single sentence of para. 171 concerning the analysis of the scope of Discriminatory Action in relation to the Petrozuata Project: \"*For Petrozuata, such Discriminatory Action should follow a 'Development Decision' (Sec. 1.01); such a decision has nothing in common with an expropriation*.*\"*1149 The sentence is clear,1150 its persuasiveness is not subject to review under Article 52(1)(e) and the expression should be understood within the context of the other explanations given through paras. 171 and 175 on why the expropriation of the Project could not come within the meaning of Discriminatory Action in the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata Association Agreement.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 409; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 522.\n\nFootnote 31 at para. 171 of the Award indicates that Venezuela considered that the definition of Discriminatory Action did not cover non-economic measures such as change in operatorship (**A/R-7 [Curtis] / A/R-48 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Respondent's Counter-Memorial, dated 27 July 2009, \u00b6 278).\n\n788.\n\nAnother allegation of an absence of reasons concerns the Tribunal's explanations regarding the Hamaca Project that the terms of the compensation provisions included \"*only assets or interests as part of the Association*\" and not \"*the entire Project governed by the Association Agreement*.\" It is impossible, says the Applicant, to follow how the Tribunal found in para. 172 that the subject matter of the claims was the expropriation of ConocoPhillips' assets as part of the Association while concluding that this provision did not apply to an expropriation of the entire Hamaca Project. The position that expropriation may only refer to part of the rights arising from the Association Agreement is in the Applicant's view nonsensical because the Project corresponds to a bundle of rights which ConocoPhillips held under the Association Agreements which leaves no room for distinguishing between the expropriation of one right and the entire bundle.1151\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 518, 523-524.\n\n789.\n\nThese sentences should not be taken out of context. The ending statement of para. 172 that \"*the buy-out regime of the Hamaca Association Agreement is based necessarily on the existence of an ongoing Project, and completely incompatible with its taking by the Government through an expropriation*\" follows the finding at para. 171 that the compensation provisions of the Hamaca Association Agreement assumed the continued existence of the Project. It would not have been without some contradiction if the Tribunal had in between these two passages interpreted the case of expropriation illustrated in the Discriminatory Action of the Hamaca Project as applying to the entire Project, which corresponds to the investor's rights conferred by Congressional authorizations,1152 because the Project could no longer be ongoing, but terminated. The Applicant chooses to concentrate on the convincing nature and quality of the reasons which are irrelevant under Article 52(1)(e) as further illustrated by its disputation of the distinction made between \"*assets*\" and \"*Project*\".1153\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 178.\n\n*Duke Energy Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 162.\n\n790.\n\nFinally, the Applicant's allusion to the Tribunal's failure to refer to the pre-contractual documentation provided by the Parties in its analysis of the Discriminatory Action definitions1154 is clearly a challenge of the Tribunal's interpretation of the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements. It is for the Parties to draw the Tribunal's attention to the pertinent documents. The relevance of the documentary evidence is not reviewed in annulment proceedings which are not a continuation of the arbitration proceedings. The Award enumerates the evidence which was put forward by Venezuela for the Petrozuata and the Hamaca Projects.1155 It is well settled law that failure to address each and every piece of evidence does not amount to a failure to state reasons.1156 Absent any substantiation of the significance of a specific item of omitted evidence to the disputed issue,1157 this assertion appears to invite the Committee to substitute the Applicant's interpretation to that of the Tribunal. This the Committee would not and could not do.

It recites that the Parties were informed on 23 December 2016 that further submittal of documents referred to during the ICC hearing or other documents not on record in the ICC arbitration would not be granted leave by the Tribunal. When ConocoPhillips took the initiative to file the ICC Award rendered on 24 April 2018, the Tribunal ended the discussion between the Parties on the role of the ICC tribunal's decision by reconfirming that the ICC Award could only be submitted for the information of the Tribunal.1159 Any \"*reasonable, attentive and willing reader*\"1160 can understand the above motivation even, if like the Applicant, it would not share the Tribunal's decision as to the introduction in the underlying proceedings of the ICC award rendered between the Conoco Parties and PDVSA.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.

The Tribunal's decision to avoid the discussion of new evidence after the filing of the ICC award a decade after the beginning of the ICSID arbitration did not prevent the Tribunal from being informed about the reasons which led the ICC Tribunal to hold expropriation as a Discriminatory Action. As a result, the Applicant's alleged negation of its right to present the ICC award in support of its position on the Association Agreements lacks materiality. Quite to the contrary, the Tribunal took into consideration the expropriation through an agglomerate of governmental measures examined in the ICC arbitration when it discussed the possibility of a Parties' agreement on the scope of the compensation provisions.1163 The Tribunal had ample opportunity to learn of the ICC Tribunal's reasons regarding the qualification of measures as Discriminatory Action in the contractual relations with PDVSA.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 421; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 537-538.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Award*, \u00b6 35, footnote no. 7.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 173.\n\n**E.

In addition, Venezuela (Curtis and De Jes\u00fas) invoke manifest excess of powers, failure to state reasons and serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in relation to the Tribunal's application of the valuation date for the compensation of the expropriation of Conoco's assets (**E.2**).\n\n795.\n\nThe summary of the arguments advanced by Venezuela (Curtis) can be found in **Sections E.1(1)** andX **E.2(2)**, those by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) in **Section E.2(1)**, and the arguments by the Conoco Parties are in **Sections E.1(2)** and **E.2(3)**. The Committee's analysis of the grounds invoked in relation to the Tribunal's findings on quantum inputs is addressed in **Section E.1(3)**. The analysis related to the valuation date is in section **E.2(4)(1)** (De Jes\u00fas) and **E.2(4)(2)**(Curtis).\n\n**E.1 Grounds Related to the Inputs on Quantum**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**E.1(1) Grounds Related to the Inputs on Quantum (Curtis)**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n796.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal (i) manifestly exceeded its powers; (ii) failed to state reasons; and (iii) seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure with respect to the Tribunal's treatments of (a) the Windfall Profits Tax (WPT); (b) the Shadow Tax; (b) the Negative Cash Flows; and (d) the Profit-Sharing Agreement.\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*i. In relation to the Windfall Profit Tax*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n797.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal exceeded the scope of its authority (i) by making up its own Budget Price of US$60 when both sides had calculated the impact of the WPT using a Budget Price of US$40; (ii) by disregarding the finding of the ICC Tribunal, which the Parties agreed had the \"exclusive adjudicatory authority\" to determine the meaning of the Discriminatory Action provisions, their application, and whether a governmental act fell within the ambit of those provisions; and (iii) by awarding *ultra petita* an additional US$140 million in compensation to the Conoco Parties,1164 since no party requested such relief.1165\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 697.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 698.\n\n798.\n\nOn the issue of the Budget Price, Venezuela argues, contrary to Conoco, that the issue is not about the Tribunal's discretion to assess the probative value of documents and evidence; rather it is the Tribunal's departure from the Budget Price accepted by the Parties and their experts, as well as the free invention of its own Budget Price which resulted in an increase in compensation by USD 495 million.1166\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 383, 384.\n\n799.\n\nOn the findings of the ICC tribunal, Venezuela asserts that it is irrelevant that Conoco made the statement that the ICC tribunal had the \"exclusive adjudicatory authority\" in their Memorial on Quantum before the ICC arbitration existed. Conoco's argument that the ICSID Tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction regarding Venezuela's Treaty breaches does not alter Conoco's acknowledgment that the ICC tribunal had \"exclusive adjudicatory authority\" on the meaning of \"Discriminatory Action.\"1167 It was not disputed between the Parties that the ICC tribunal should determine the interpretation of the meaning of the compensation provisions, including if a particular governmental action (whether expropriation or the WPT) adversely affecting the Upgrading Projects constituted a \"Discriminatory Action.\"1168 Conoco's argument that the Tribunal would not have been bound by Parties' agreement even if there had been one is not credible. Earlier decisions are unanimous that a tribunal may not disregard party agreements or exceed their submissions.1169 The ICC and ICSID arbitrations involved the same issue, namely whether the WPT was a \"Discriminatory Action\" within the meaning of the compensation provisions and shared, in part, the same parties, namely, CPH's wholly owned subsidiary and CPZ.1170\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 378.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 380.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 381.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 382.\n\n800.\n\nOn the issue of *ultra petita*, Venezuela adds that the Tribunal went beyond the Conoco Parties' submissions and request for relief, when it granted compensation for the WPT on the ground that it was a \"Discriminatory Action,\"1171 even though the Conoco Parties did not seek compensation on that ground; something which the Tribunal expressly noted in the Award.1172\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 375.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 374, citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 765.\n\n*ii. In relation to the Shadow Tax*\n-----------------------------------\n\n801.\n\nVenezuela also argues the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it excluded the Shadow Tax from the damages calculation, When Parties agreed that an *ex-post* valuation of the fiscal regime for the Projects should include the Shadow Tax and that the the Shadow Tax should be calculated throughout the life of the Projects using the agreed mechanisms.1173\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 721, 722.\n\n802.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela refers to various expert reports and submissions on record regarding the application of the Shadow Tax in an *ex-post* valuation. However, the Tribunal decided not to apply the Shadow Tax, reasoning that the Parties' explanation of the tax lacked precision and documentary support. This, according to Venezuela totally disregarded the Parties' common understanding. Venezuela refutes Conoco's position that the Tribunal was not bound to accept any position of the parties. For Venezuela, the Tribunal has no discretion to disregard uncontested parameters like this one. Venezuela argues, contrary to Conoco, that the tribunal's authority is not solely determined by the arbitration clause or the applicable law; agreements made between the parties modifying the scope of the tribunal's authority can be made at any time during the cause of arbitration. Venezuela argues that a tribunal will be deciding *ultra petita* if it exceeds the parties' submissions and their requests for relief.1174\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 395-397.\n\n*iii. In relation to the Negative Cash Flows*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n803.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal's failure to account for the negative cash flows in its compensation calculation constituted an additional reason for the annulment of the Award. Venezuela submits that the Conoco Parties never disputed their obligation to contribute to the Projects during years of negative cash flows, and their calculations acknowledged that negative cash flows need to be considered.1175\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 729.\n\n804.\n\nVenezuela submits the Tribunal had artificially inflated the compensation value by USD 181 million. This resulted from the Tribunal treating as zero, instead of deducting them, the negative cash flows that occurred in the Corocoro Project in 2007, 2008 and 2015 for all Projects. However, Venezuela notes that the Conoco Parties disputed this, stating that negative cash flows only occurred with the Corocoro Project in 2007 and 2008.1176\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 730.\n\n805.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela notes that both parties acknowledged negative cash flows in their valuations. It conceded that, unlike other quantum issues raised as grounds for challenge, the Parties did not have an express agreement on the issue of negative cash flow. As a matter of fact, Venezuela notes that the cash flows excluded were the same as the Tribunal had calculated at paragraphs 716 (in relation to the Corocoro Project) and 777 (in relation to the Petrozuata and Hamaca Projects) of the Award before excluding them in the final Award.1177\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 402.\n\n*iv. In relation to the Application of the \"Participaci\u00f3n del Estado en Ganancias\" per the Profit-Sharing Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n806.\n\nVenezuela submits that in its calculation of the compensation due for the expropriation of the Corocoro Project, the Tribunal ignored that, as established by the Congressional Authorization and as agreed by the Parties in the Profit Sharing Agreement, the \"Participaci\u00f3n del Estado en las Ganancias\" (\"PEG\") would be paid to the Government.1178 Venezuela stresses that the Parties had agreed that the PEG was an essential element of the fiscal regime for the Corocoro Project, which had to be considered in the valuation. According to Venezuela, the Tribunal also disregarded the Parties' agreement that the PEG would be calculated at 50% throughout the life of the Profit-Sharing Agreement and the mechanics for calculating the PEG.1179\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 755.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 756.\n\n807.\n\nIn its Reply, Venezuela argues that the Tribunal's disregard of the PEG was not a mere oversight.1180 Venezuela refers to Conoco's expert reports and submissions, which acknowledged the PEG and accounted for it in their valuations.1181 Contrary to Conoco's argument that the Tribunal was not bound to follow the Parties' quantum calculation methods even when the Parties adopted compatible approaches, Venezuela argues that the PEG was an essential feature of the Corocoro Project. Venezuela submits that the PEG was not an agreement reached during the arbitration; instead it was a \"special agreement\" governing investments under Article 9 of BIT, created under the Congressional Authorization for the Project and incorporated into the Profit-Sharing Agreement from the outset. Venezuela submits that ignoring such agreement was not a mere exercise of discretion by the Tribunal, but a manifest excess of authority which warrants annulment of the Award.1182\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 408.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 409.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 413.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate reasons***\n------------------------------------------\n\n*i. In relation to the Windfall Profits Tax*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n808.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal's determination regarding the WPT is incoherent and cannot be reconciled with its decision on liability. For Venezuela, \"there is no plausible explanation for the Tribunal to (i) award damages for the Windfall Profits Tax after finding that tax to be lawful, (ii) ignore the treatment by both parties of the Budget Price in calculating the Windfall Profits Tax, (iii) award any damages for the Windfall Profits Tax under the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata Association Agreement when the Conoco Parties 'do not rely on the very specific provisions on discriminatory action contained in the Association Agreements of Petrozuata and Hamaca' to claim such damages, or (iv) disregard the decision of the ICC Tribunal that the Windfall Profits Tax was not a 'Discriminatory Action' within the meaning of those compensation provisions, despite the fact that the Conoco Parties had agreed that the ICC Tribunal was the 'exclusive adjudicatory authority' on this issue and 'the forum which would be empowered to determine, for example, what the Discriminatory Action provisions mean.'\"1183\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 701; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 386-389.\n\n*ii. In relation to the Shadow tax*\n-----------------------------------\n\n809.\n\nVenezuela also submits that the Tribunal's explanations to cast aside the Shadow Tax from the calculation are incomprehensible. Venezuela maintains that there is an extensive record of both Parties applying and calculating the Shadow Tax in their submissions and in their economic models, showing how each one took the Shadow Tax into account in their calculations. And yet, the Tribunal disregarded the Shadow Tax characterizing the explanation of the experts \"lack[ed] precision\" or suggesting they were not sufficiently detailed. For Venezuela, the Tribunal's failure to account for the Shadow Tax without any colorable reason warrants annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(e).1184\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 724.\n\n810.\n\nVenezuela argues the Tribunal failed to explain why it felt free to disregard the Parties' clear agreement on the applicability of the Shadow Tax. Conoco's interpretation that a tribunal has the discretion to decide beyond parties' agreement, submissions or requests for relief has no support in any recognized authority.1185\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 399.\n\n*iii. In relation to the Negative Cash Flows*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n811.\n\nVenezuela maintains that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for excluding the negative cash flows of the Projects in calculating compensation. Venezuela notes that the Award provides no reasons for treating negative cash flows as zero, nor as to why the Tribunal would make the decision to exclude negative cash flows when the Parties themselves had given effect to them in their respective calculations. It is irrelevant if negative cash flows occurred only in two years, that does not change the fact for the lack of rationale for their exclusion. This failure to provide reasons also constitutes grounds for annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(e).1186\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 732; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 403, 404.\n\n*iv. In relation to the Application of the PEG per the Profit-Sharing Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n812.\n\nVenezuela also submits that the Tribunal's reasons for its decision to ignore the PEG in determining compensation for the Corocoro Project were insufficient, and cannot be followed from Point A to Point B.\n\n813.\n\nThe Tribunal's purported explanation that none of the experts went beyond the definition of the rate under Article I of the Association Agreement, only gives rise to additional grounds for annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.1187 Venezuela adds that stating that the Parties did not adequately explain the PEG is not a reason for departing from the Parties' agreement on the substantive point of the applicability of the PEG and the method to apply it.1188\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 758, 760.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 414.\n\n***S****erious departure from a** **F****undamental** **R****ule of** **P****rocedure***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*i. In relation to the Windfall Profits Tax*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n814.\n\nThe Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by not respecting Venezuela's right to be heard regarding the Tribunal's decision to adopt the US$60 Budget Price for calculating the WPT Tax even though both sides had used a Budget Price of US$40. Venezuela's position is that if the Tribunal intended to depart from the Parties' and the Experts' Budget Price, it should have first given Venezuela an opportunity to respond. Had it done so, in Venezuela's view, the US$60 Budget Price would not have been applied. Yet, the Tribunal deprived Venezuela from the right to be heard on that point, thereby, seriously departing from a fundamental rule of procedure.1189\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 711.\n\n815.\n\nVenezuela submits, contrary to Conoco's position, that the issue is not if there were quantum hearings and briefs, but how the Tribunal could -without warning and without giving Venezuela an opportunity to comment- adopt its own Budget Price even after seeing the Parties' common assumption as to the Budget Price for the period after 2016.1190\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 390.\n\n*ii. In relation to the Shadow Tax*\n-----------------------------------\n\n816.\n\nVenezuela argues that if the Tribunal considered that it needed more information on the Shadow Tax, it should have requested the Parties to provide additional information, rather than to ignore the Shadow Tax. Venezuela therefore argues that the Tribunal's decision to not give effect to the Shadow Tax also constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.1191 Venezuela counters Conoco, arguing that the issue is not about how many hearings were held or briefs were filed; but rather how the Tribunal, without warning, disregarded the tax agreed upon by the Parties, which consequently inflated compensation by approximately USD 675 million.1192\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 725.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 400, 401.\n\n*iii. In relation to the Negative Cash Flows*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n817.\n\nFor Venezuela, if the Tribunal intended to disregard the negative cash flows and treat them as zero, it should have given the Parties an opportunity to be heard on that point. If the Tribunal had done so, Venezuela would have pointed out that both sides had accounted for negative cash flows in their presentations and that failure to account for the negative cash flows would lead to overcompensating the Conoco Parties in the *ex-post* valuation. The Tribunal's decision to not give effect to the negative cash flows constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.1193\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 733; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 403.\n\n*iv. In relation to the Application of the PEG per the Profit-Sharing Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n818.\n\nVenezuela also asserts that the Tribunal's decision to not give effect to the PEG constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Venezuela argues that, if the Tribunal intended to depart from the agreement and submissions of the Parties and their experts, it should have first given Venezuela an opportunity to respond, and if it had done so, the PEG would have been applied and the result on Corocoro would have been different, even assuming that all other parts of the Tribunal's decision on the Corocoro Project were correct, which in any event is not the1194 case.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 761; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 415\n\n**E.1(2) No Annullable Error in the Tribunal's Treatment of Quantum Inputs (Conoco)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***N****o** **M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*i. In relation to the Windfall Profits Tax*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n819.\n\nConoco maintains that it is false that the Tribunal acted *ultra petita* going beyond Claimants' submissions in relation to the WPT. Conoco submits that both Parties addressed the issue of whether the WPT as constituted a Discriminatory Action, and the Tribunal was entitled to answer the question. Conoco affirms its argument made during the arbitration that if the WPT were applicable, it would constitute a Discriminatory Action within the meaning of the Association Agreements. Conoco supports this by referring to the transcript of the March 2017 Hearing.1195\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 657, 658, citing **A/R-93 [Curtis] / A/R-134 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *March 2017 Hearing*, pp. 4394:19\u20134395:6 (Claimants' Closing) (PDF p. 337); and Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 660, citing **A/R-93 [Curtis] / A/R-134 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *March 2017 Hearing*, pp. 4538:2\u20138 (Tribunal questions to Parties) (PDF p. 373); Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 248.\n\n820.\n\nFurther, Conoco notes that Venezuela responded in its Post-Hearing Brief of May 2017 that the WPT operated as an additional royalty (rather than a tax) and could thus not be a Discriminatory Action.1196 Venezuela agreed that the valuation should account for the compensation provisions agreed established under the Congressional Authorization and acknowledged that if the WPT were considered a Discriminatory Action within the meaning of the Association Agreements, then the Claimants would be eligible to receive compensation for its effects.1197\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 661, referring to **A/R-92 [Curtis] / A/R-133 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Venezuela's Post-Hearing Brief (previously R-765), 19 May 2017, (\"*Respondent's PHB*\"), \u00b6 199.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 661, citing **A/R-92 [Curtis] / A/R-133 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Respondent's PHB*, \u00b6 201; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 249.\n\n821.\n\nIn any event, even if the Claimant had not argued that the WPT would constitute a Discriminatory Action, the Tribunal's decision would not be *ultra petita* because this issue cannot be distinguished from the Claimant's broader request for full compensation under international law.1198\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 251, 252.\n\n822.\n\nAdditionally, the Tribunal was not bound by the conclusions of the ICC Tribunal, and the Parties never agreed that the ICSID Tribunal would be bound by the decisions of another Tribunal. The ICC arbitration involved different parties and claims and could not have had *res judicata* effect as to the ICSID Tribunal. Venezuela relies on a statement made in Claimants' Memorial on Quantum on May 2014 before the ICC arbitration existed, that \"[j]urisdiction over the Association Agreements\" was not vested in the ICSID Tribunal because the \"[t]he Association Agreements vest exclusive adjudicatory authority in arbitral tribunals established under the auspices of the ICC.\"1199However, the Claimants also stated that the ICSID Tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction over Venezuela's Treaty breaches, which is the claim assessed by the ICSID Tribunal.1200\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 667, citing **A/R-85 [Curtis] / A/R-126 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Claimants' Memorial on Quantum (previously R-758), 19 May 2014, (\"*Claimants' Memorial on Quantum*\"), \u00b6 95.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 667.\n\n823.\n\nBesides, Claimants' unilateral declaration is not an agreement between the Parties. Nowhere in its submissions shows that Venezuela agreed to this position.1201Like all international tribunals, the Tribunal was competent to determine its own jurisdiction, and one party's unilateral statement does not define the contours of the Tribunal's power to decide.1202\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 254(a).\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 254(b).\n\n824.\n\nRegarding the Budget Price of US$ 60, Conoco argues that the Tribunal was entitled to exercise its discretion in evaluating the evidence on record and to arrive at its own conclusion. The discretion to assess the evidence is a general principal of law, recognized by the International Court of Justice and ICSID jurisprudence.1203In its Rejoinder, Conoco notes that Venezuela did not offer a response on the authorities showing that the tribunal have a wide margin of discretion on quantum issues.1204\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 674.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 259.\n\n825.\n\nBesides, Parties did not agree on the applicable Budget Price. Claimants' experts in its valuation model applied the WPT assumptions made by Venezuela's experts solely to present \"a sensitivity showing the economic effects\" of applying the WPT in the manner Venezuela proposed.1205 In its Rejoinder, Conoco reiterates that the Claimant did not 'accept' any particular Budget Price.1206\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 675.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 258.\n\n*ii. In relation to the Shadow Tax*\n-----------------------------------\n\n826.\n\nConoco submits that it was within the Tribunal's discretion not to apply the Shadow Taw because doing so would be too speculative, since the Parties had failed to provide documentation substantiating the existence of the tax under Venezuelan law, nor evidence on how the tax was meant to be applied to the Projects. Despite the Shadow Tax being an input into the quantum calculation, its non-application does not amount to a failure to apply the law. Conoco refers to Rule 34 of the ICSID Rules to maintain that the Tribunal had discretion to determine the damages owed. It also refers to the *ad hoc* committee's decision in *Dogan v. Turkmenistan*, which rejected Turkmenistan's claim that the tribunal had exceeded its powers by awarding damages based on a methodology that neither party advanced, finding that the valuation process followed by the tribunal was based on the tribunal's appreciation of the evidence.1207\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 705, referring to **A/CLA-79**, *Adem Dogan v. Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/9, Decision on Annulment, 15 January 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 165\u201366; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 277.\n\n827.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco submits that Venezuela offers no support for its assertion that it is \"a manifestly incorrect statement of the law\" to contend that the parties' quantum calculations do not constitute the kind of agreement on applicable law restricting a tribunal's discretion.1208 Conoco also argues that since it had requested relief in the form of compensation for the expropriation, the Tribunal was tasked to decide the quantum of that compensation using its discretion.1209\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 278, citing Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 395.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 279.\n\n*iii. In relation to the Negative Cash Flows*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n828.\n\nConoco argues that the Tribunal had discretion to deal with quantum issues and errors in calculating compensation are not grounds for annulment. Conoco notes that Venezuela's actual complaint is not that the Tribunal excluded negative cash flows from its compensation calculations, but rather that it did not include *pro rata* cash call obligations under the Association Agreements for the one-and-a-half years in which net cash flows were negative under the Tribunal's calculations. This failure, according to Venezuela, resulted in overcompensation.1210 However, Conoco argues that (i) a tribunal is not bound to follow the parties' quantum calculation methods, even if they adopt compatible approaches, since they do not constituted an \"agreement\" that is binding on a tribunal and capable of giving rise to an excess of powers; (ii) the Tribunal had considerable discretion on matters of quantum, especially to decide on the admissibility of any evidence adduced and its probative value; (iii) the Tribunal's decision fell within the \"legal framework\" established in the case and was not beyond the Parties' submissions; (iv) Venezuela had no right to preview the Tribunal's quantum decisions and provide additional submissions on their accuracy prior to the Final Award being rendered; and (v) the Tribunal was free to adopt a quantum calculation method that it considered to be the most appropriate in the circumstances, based on the evidence submitted and the arguments made by the parties and their experts.1211\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 722.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 719.\n\n829.\n\nConoco argues that Venezuela's true complaint is that the Tribunal made a clerical or arithmetical error by incorrectly excluding the same cash flows it had previously calculated at paragraph. 716 (in relation to Corocoro) and 777 (in relation to Petrozuata and Hamaca) of the Award. However , Conoco argues that the proper remedy to Venezuela's complaint is an application under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, not an annulment under Article 52(1).1212\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 283.\n\n*iv. In relation to the Application of the PEG per the Profit-Sharing Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n830.\n\nThe Tribunal's failure to apply the PEG does not amount to failure to apply the applicable law. There is no such failure when a tribunal decides that it would be too speculative under the law to apply particular provisions of the accounting procedures contained in a contract, when the operation of those provisions has not been adequately substantiated or explained to it. Conoco submits that paragraph 721 of the Award makes clear that the Tribunal did not apply the PEG because it found that the Parties' experts failed to provide the Tribunal with sufficient evidence or explanations as to how the PEG could or should have been applied. In any event, tribunals are not obliged to deal with every piece of evidence or contractual provision invoked by a party.1213\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 725-729.\n\n831.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco submits that Venezuela (Curtis) raised no new arguments on its Reply concerning the PEG, but that Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) raised in its Reply complaints about the Tribunal's treatment of the PEG.1214 Conoco's rebuttal to Venezuela's (De Jes\u00fas) arguments on this point are addressed below in **Section E.2(3)**.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 284.\n\n***N****o** **F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*i. In relation to the Windfall Profits Tax*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n832.\n\nThe Tribunal provided sufficient reasons for the decision on WPT, based on the following observations: (i) the conclusion that the WPT was lawful under international law does not preclude the conclusion that the WPT was a Discriminatory Action under the Association Agreements. Conoco refers to paragraph 783 of the Award which clarifies that while Venezuela was autonomous to exercise its sovereign power to adopt the WPT, the imposition of such tax on the Claimants while other oil companies were exempt would be a Discriminatory Action within the meaning of the Association Agreements;1215 (ii) the Parties had not agreed on a Budget Price that would have triggered the application of the WPT,1216 and the Tribunal did not fail to give reasons for adopting a Budget Price of USD 60 per barrel. Venezuela's complaints are based on *incorrect* reasons, whereas annulment does not concern itself with the correctness of a decision;1217 (iii) the Tribunal recognized that while the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata and Hamaca Association Agreements do not govern the Claimants' right to compensation under the BIT, they may be considered if certain taxes constitute discriminatory actions that trigger a right for compensation and offset the taxes themselves,1218and (iv) the Tribunal was not obliged explain why it did not adopt the ICC tribunal's reasoning, as it was not bound by the ICC tribunal's decision.1219\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 680(a).\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 680(b).\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 267.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 680(c), citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 718.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 680(d); Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 266.\n\n*ii. In relation to the Shadow Tax*\n-----------------------------------\n\n833.\n\nAn award cannot be annulled because a party is unconvinced by the reasons provided. It is possible to follow the Tribunal's reasoning from Point A to Point B: the Tribunal decided not to apply the Shadow Tax in its calculations because the parties' experts' explanations \"lack[ed] precision,\" had \"no documentary support\" and were unsupported \"by any reference to legal or other sources.\"1220\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 709, citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 719, footnote no. 536.\n\n834.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco submits it appears that Venezuela changed its case regarding Article 52(1)(e) to argue that the Tribunal gave reasons but failed to explain why it disregarded the Parties' agreement on the applicability of the Shadow Tax. Conoco counters that there is no requirement to provide \"reasons for reasons,\" and in any event, the Tribunal explained Parties had failed to substantiate their positions on the application of the tax.1221\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 281.\n\n*iii. In relation to the Negative Cash Flows*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n835.\n\nConoco submits that the discretion afforded to tribunals in all matters of quantum calculations permits a tribunal to provide terse or even no reasoning regarding individual inputs into a quantum analysis. Conoco refers to the decision of the ad hoc committee in *Rumeli Telekom* which found no grounds to annul the award even where the damages figure was \"baldly stated in the Award, without an explanation of a mathematical calculation undertaken by the Tribunal in arriving at it.\"1222 Conoco argues that annulment should not be granted, regardless of whether the parties' experts included negative cash flows in their quantum calculations, or whether the Tribunal provided reasons for not including those cash flows in its own calculations.1223\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 720, citing *Rumeli Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 178.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 721.\n\n*iv. In relation to the Application of the PEG per the Profit-Sharing Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n836.\n\nThe Tribunal's reasons for its decision to not apply the PEG are clear. Tribunal observed that the parties had failed to evidence and explain the applicability of the PEG to the Corocoro project. While the PEG may have been included in the Excel spreadsheets provided by the Parties' experts, that did not address the Tribunal's concern that the application of PEG was not explained, leaving the Tribunal to consider the figure in its calculation of damages without engaging in speculation. Conoco relies on paragraph 270 of the Award in support of the foregoing argument.1224\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 730.\n\n***N****o** **S****erious** **D****eparture***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n*i. In relation to the Windfall Profit Tax*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n837.\n\nThere was no departure from the right to be heard, less a serious departure with material impact on the outcome of the Award. The parties' right to be heard does not entitle them to limitless presentations nor does it obligate a tribunal to submit its reasoning for parties' approval before rendering the award. The Tribunal gave Venezuela ample opportunity to ventilate its arguments on compensation, including the calculation of the WPT, in four hearings, five separate briefs and responses to the Tribunal's questions.1225\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 691.\n\n838.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco argues that Venezuela's own experts had initially advocated for a Budget Price of USD 60, therefore not only did Venezuela have the opportunity to comment on the precise Budget Price adopted by the Tribunal, but it had also at one point advocated for that Budget Price.1226\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 272.\n\n*ii. In relation to the Shadow Tax*\n-----------------------------------\n\n839.\n\nConoco submits that the right to be heard refers to the opportunity given to the parties to present their position, not how tribunals deal with the arguments and evidence presented to them1227 Conoco argues that the Tribunal afforded Parties and their respective experts multiple opportunities to explain and substantiate their positions on the Shadow Tax and all other quantum issues, through experts' briefs and reports, oral arguments and presentations at five separate hearings between 2008 and 2017. The Tribunal cautioned Parties not to include figures in their valuation models that were not substantiated by evidence, yet Venezuela failed to provide the Tribunal with necessary evidence and explanations on the Shadow Tax.1228\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 713, citing *Tulip Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 82.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 715.\n\n*iii. In relation to the Negative Cash Flows*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n840.\n\nConoco argues that the Tribunal cannot be blamed for not including in its assessment a calculation that was not detailed in the Parties' submissions or the experts' reports. Venezuela failed to bring clearly to the attention of the Tribunal information that it wished the Tribunal to considered, and Venezuela cannot cure that failure in the annulment proceeding. According to Conoco, the Tribunal considered both sets of experts to have taken unrealistic positions on certain quantum inputs, and that they had not provided evidence in a form helpful to the Tribunal. Therefore, in Conoco's view, the Tribunal was entitled to exercise its discretion on quantum inputs, including by not replicating every calculation performed, but not explained, by those experts.1229\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 723.\n\n*iv. In relation to the Application of the PEG per the Profit-Sharing Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n841.\n\nConoco submits that a tribunal is not bound to follow the parties' quantum calculation methods, even if they adopt compatible approaches. Venezuela had no right to preview the Tribunal's quantum decisions and provide additional submissions on their validity prior to issuing the Award; instead, the Tribunal had the discretion to adopt a calculation it considered most appropriate based on the evidence adduced and arguments the parties and their experts made.1230\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 730.\n\n**E.1(3) Committee's Analysis on Grounds Related to Inputs on Quantum**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n842.\n\nThe Applicant challenges decisions made by the Arbitral Tribunal in the determination of royalties and taxes which, as stated in the Award, constitute a part of the economic value of the three Projects that impact on the valuation of ConocoPhillips' loss.1231 The impugned decisions concern:\n\na. the WPT which operated as an additional royalty when oil prices exceeded the Budget Price annually approved by the National Assembly in the Budget Law;\n\nb. the Shadow Tax which was a fiscal measure requiring each Project to pay the excess, if any, of 50% of the gross income over the sum of all royalties, taxes and contributions paid by the Project;\n\nc. the Negative Cash Flows; and\n\nd. the PEG, which was a profit share granted to the State for the Corocoro Project.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 718.\n\n843.\n\nThe Applicant alleges that these decisions were all made in disregard of the Parties' common approach in their valuation calculations.1232.\n\n\u2022 WPT: The Applicant explains that its experts had throughout the arbitration, relied on the Budget Price of crude at US$ 40 per barrel based for the year 2017 on the last observable data included in the 2016 Budget Law. The Conoco Parties never challenged the use of the last Budget Price as approved by the National Assembly for 2017 and that Conoco's experts explicitly incorporated into their valuation model the same Budget Price used by Venezuela's experts. Despite the recognition by the Parties' agreement of the price of US$40 per barrel, the Tribunal made its projection based on a price 50% higher than the Budget Price used by both parties in their respective calculations. It set the threshold price of crude oil at US$60 per barrel in years after 2016 which then reduced the WPT that would have applied to the Projects for collection and thus increased the damages awarded for the expropriation by approximately US$ 495 million.1233\n\n\u2022 Shadow Tax: The Applicant says that this tax was incorporated by both Parties into every valuation and presentation submitted. Although the Tribunal acknowledged the lack of dispute between the Parties and the fact that the Conoco Parties did not ask for specific relief for these measures, the Tribunal excluded from the calculation of compensation the effect of the Shadow Tax mechanism which was designed to ensure that the overall tax burden would not be less than 50% of the gross income. This resulted in an increased compensation of US$ 675 million awarded to the Conoco Parties.1234\n\n\u2022 Negative Cash Flow: The Applicants says that the Tribunal departed from the Parties' approach regarding the treatment of negative cash flows which in a but-for world would have forced ConocoPhillips to inject cash into the Projects. This had the effect of increasing the compensation by US$ 181 million.1235\n\n\u2022 PEG: The Tribunal's refusal to apply the PEG which would require that 50% of annual operating income go to the Government despite the fact that each Party's experts accounted for it in their valuation models, and arrived at more than US$ 552 million as the principal amount of compensation for the Corocoro Project.1236\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 673-675, 683, 712, 726, 734, 747.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 683-684, 687; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 383, 385.

The Parties were in dispute about the application of the WPT1237 with Conoco submitting that the measure enacted after the expropriation would artificially reduce Venezuela's compensation in breach of its full reparation obligation under international law.1238 The Applicant emphasizes the following wording in paragraph 767 of the Award, which states that: \"[t]*he Tribunal notes while the Claimants object to the application of the WPT in the present case, they did not raise objections to the application as it has been submitted by the Respondent's experts in their reports and in their calculations as per December 2016*,\" to argue that ConocoPhillips accepted the Budget Price as US$ 40 per barrel.1239\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 722.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 729.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 687; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 385.\n\n845.\n\nThe Committee notes that the wording cited by the Applicant is preceded by the following passage:\n\n*\"The Tribunal notes that the Claimants' experts were instructed not to examine the Windfall Profit Tax. They must have done so nevertheless because they reported to the Tribunal that whether or not the WPT is applied, the difference in taxation is 21%, which would be in the Claimant's case a reduction compared to the Respondent's position.*\"1240\n\nAs the Applicant acknowledges and Conoco clarifies,1241 Conoco's experts applied the WPT assumptions used by Venezuela's experts for the sole purpose of \"*presenting a sensitivity showing the economic effects*\" of applying the WPT in the manner proposed by Venezuela.1242 Conoco referred to the US$ 40 per barrel only to illustrate the economic effects of their client's legal instruction not to include the WPT, which was the major difference between the instructions given to the experts on both sides when preparing their valuations.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 767.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 691; Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 675.\n\n**A/R-99 [Curtis] / A/R-140 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Consolidated Update Report of Manuel A.

Guatemala*:\n\n\"[Claimant] *surmises that such agreement existed from fragments of Guatemala's expert reports. However, it is quite common in international arbitration for opposing parties' experts to verify each other's methodologies and for opposing parties to present a tribunal with various hypotheses to use in its final calculations.

The Applicant softens its language when describing a \"*lack of dispute\"*1253 over the inclusion of the Shadow Tax in the calculation of damages and even acknowledges there was only a \"*common\"* or \"*plain*\" understanding between the parties on its application.1254 In a like manner, the Applicant alludes to a departure in the chart at paragraph 954 of the Award \"*from the approach of both sides in the Arbitration*,\"1255 disregarding of a \"*not express*\" agreement1256 that it infers from the inclusion of the negative cash flows in the historical years of the Projects with in the Conoco Parties' valuation models.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 716.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 392, 394.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 726, 728, footnote 1467.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 403.\n\n850.\n\nThe Committee cannot follow the Applicant in its attempt to qualify the above-alleged lapses of the Tribunal as expressions of a manifest excess of powers. The Committee must dispel the polysemic wording in the Applicant's contentions concerning the Tribunal's disregard for the parties' purported agreements on valuation issues. Acting beyond the scope of authority in contravention of the parties' consent to arbitration is a manifest excess of powers1257 because the arbitral tribunal decides a claim without the parties' authorization. In contrast, the situation described by the Applicant is a question that was not submitted to the parties, but rather one in which a question was withdrawn from the Tribunal's jurisdiction by agreement of the Parties. It is noteworthy that the Applicant does not argue that that the Parties modified by common agreement the claims on quantum submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal. The contentious point regarding ConocoPhillips' compensation claims for expropriation remained unchanged, despite the alleged common understanding or shared approach on the valuation assumptions of the Shadow Tax or the PEG. The Committee agrees with the Claimant that the Tribunal was not \"*disempowered*\" from determining the Budget Price used in the valuation.1258\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 696.\n\nTr. Day 3, 128:15.\n\n851.\n\nRegarding the Shadow Tax, it is worth noting the Tribunal's remark introducing the discussion on the valuation date and method, stating that \"*while the Parties present their respective positions with strong arguments, they are not always consistent*.\"1259 Against this background, the Arbitral Tribunal was acting within the confines of the debate between the Parties on the damages calculations when it noted the Shadow Tax in footnote 536 of paragraph 719 (1)1260:\n\n*\"The Respondent's experts state that the Projects 'would have been' subject to a 'Special Advantage' tax to be calculated in relation to the amount of royalties, taxes and contributions paid, but their explanation lacks precision and has no documentary support (cf. Consolidated Expert Report on Valuation, 17 November 2016, para. 140/g, further noting that this tax would not apply to Hamaca, cf. footnote 322). This tax seems to be comparable to the 'Shadow Tax' noted by the Claimants' experts, but not explained either, nor supplied by any reference to legal or other sources (Abdala/Spiller, Damages Assessment for the Takings of ConocoPhillips' Investments in Venezuela, Supplemental Report, 13 October 2014, para. 251/d).*\"\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 238.\n\nThe Tribunal took into account (1)\"*Royalties and Extraction Tax, both together operating as a royalty at a rate of 33.33%*\"on the basis of the list of royalties and taxes established by valuation experts on both sides according to their respective Party's position.\n\n852.\n\nThe Tribunal was also within the confines of the debate between the Parties when noting there again that it did not have sufficient information for inclusion in the damage calculation, it stated regarding the PEG at paragraph 721 of the Award:\n\n\"*For Corocoro, the experts on both sides mention a 'PEG Tax' equal to 50% of the annual operating income. However, none of the experts went beyond the definition of the rate under Article I of the Association Agreement. Such rate would need to be examined and determined on the basis of Article 9 of the Association Agreement's Accounting Procedures, which have not been looked at by any expert. Without such an analysis, accounting for a PEG rate would be pure speculation*.\"1261\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 721.\n\n853.\n\nThe Applicant's reproach relates to the merits of the dispute which escapes an *ad hoc* committee's permissible review under Article 52. A further illustration is the Applicant's contention of the incorrect exclusion of negative cash flows in a DCF valuation,1262 which ConocoPhillips argues is at most a computational error that falls under Article 49(2) of the Convention.1263 The Committee considers that the Tribunal simply employed a different methodology, as Parties' calculations were distinctly different from one another. The Committee concludes that the Applicant's complaint regarding the Parties' agreement could not establish an excess of powers by the Tribunal acting without the basis of an agreement between the Parties.1264\n\nTr. Day 2, 68:16-25, 69: 1-8. Memorial (Curtis), \u00b6 728, footnote 1467; Reply (Curtis): \"*the cash flows incorrectly excluded by the Tribunal were the same cash flows that the Tribunal previously calculated in paragraphs 716 (Corocoro) and 777 (Petrozuata and Hamaca)*\" (\u00b6 402). Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 283.\n\nTr. Day 3, 102: 2-10. Errors happen within and not beyond a tribunal's scope of authority and it is a well settled law under Article 52 that an excess of powers is distinct from a factual or legal error (**A/RLA-42 [Curtis] / A/RLA-6 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *ICSID Annulment Paper*.\n\n*Tza Yap Shum Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 76: \"*an excess of powers occurs every time the powers exercised by the arbitrators are not those which have been granted to them*.\"\n\n854.\n\nThe Applicant further argues that the Tribunal acted beyond the scope of authority when it disregarded the valuation positions of both Parties regarding the WPT and the PEG.1265 The Applicant cites legal writings which purport to establish that a factual matrix agreed upon by the parties is binding for the tribunal.1266\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 696, 752.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 294.\n\n855.\n\nThe Committee recognizes that it is up to Parties to introduce the relevant facts in the proceedings and that facts not presented by the parties cannot be relied upon. However, the gist of Venezuela's challenge is that, by disregarding facts which were not in dispute, the Tribunal modified the Parties' submissions as reflected in each side's expert reports. The Committee disagrees. Expert reports of an evidentiary nature should be distinguished from parties' submissions, which define the scope of the dispute; only violations of the latter may give rise to an excess of powers. The alleged ignorance by the Tribunal of the damage calculation in the expert reports does not constitute a ground for excess of powers.\n\n856.\n\nThe Applicant further complains that the Tribunal overlooked the fact that Conoco did not rely on the Discriminatory Action provisions of the Association Agreements, which both sides considered to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ICC Tribunal in the arbitration against PDVSA. The ICC tribunal found, in contrast to the Tribunal's finding, that no compensation was due for the WPT under the Discriminatory Action provisions.1267 Venezuela points to Conoco's argument that the dispute resolution clause of the Association Agreement granted exclusive jurisdiction to the ICC tribunal to determine the ambit of the Discriminatory Action provisions. This argument was made by Conoco in reply to Venezuela's allegation that said provisions denied or limited the recoverable amounts and that the distinction between treaty and contract claims was irrelevant for determining the compensation recoverable.1268 ConocoPhillips reminds that during the hearing on quantum, it repeatedly argued that the WPT, if applied, would constitute unequal treatment and entitle it to compensation under the Discriminatory Action provisions. ConocoPhillips further recalls that Venezuela rebutted that argument by claiming that the WPT could not fall under the Discriminatory Action because it operated as a royalty rather than a tax.1269\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 692, 697; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 374, 379, 382.\n\n**A/R-85 [Curtis] / A/R-126 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Claimants' Memorial on Quantum*, \u00b6\u00b6 84, 94-95. **A/R-10 [Curtis] / A/R-51 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Quantum, dated 18 August 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 154, 155 (under section 4.

At paragraphs 780 to 786, the Tribunal found that unequal treatment was established where there were operators who were exempted from the WPT under the WPT law. The Tribunal effectively concluded that \"[t]*he simple fact of unequal treatment, including unequal treatment based on the law, is sufficient to cause the situation to become a discriminatory action under the* [Petrozuata] *Agreement.*\"1271 The Tribunal further ordered compensation for approximately US$ 140 million based on the provisions of the Petrozuata Association Agreement because the Hamaca compensation system was less protective of the WPT.1272 The Applicant's contention that Conoco \"*never claimed compensation for the [WPT] on the ground that it was a 'Discriminatory Action' in this case*\"1273 is demonstrably false.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 718.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 783.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 786, 1010(3).\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 373.

In fact, these provisions may, if the applicable requirements are fulfilled, provide for a legal treatment different from the Claimants' understanding of the WPT and applicable under a but-for scenario*.\"1275\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 689-690.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 765. Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 374.\n\n859.\n\nThe impugned passage follows a finding by the Tribunal in paragraphs 760-763 of the Award that the WPT statute exemptions which Conoco unsuccessfully availed themselves of1276 \"*demonstrate that the statute can be applied differently to different investors, depending upon whether or not they comply with the full set of requirements*.\"1277 As earlier recounted, to decide on the compensation for the imposition of the WPT in a but-for world under the Discriminatory Action provisions was within the Parties' arbitration submissions. The Tribunal closed the discussion on the WPT by finding that, contrary to what ConocoPhillips argued, \"*the Windfall Profit Tax would have been applicable to the Projects. No case for an exemption has been demonstrated or supported by evidence.*\"1278 Inasmuch as the challenge of the Tribunal's decision to grant compensation for the WPT based on the Discriminatory Action provisions is directed at the clause following which Conoco \"*nonetheless do not rely on the very specific provisions on discriminatory action contained in the Association Agreements of Petrozuata and Hamaca*,\" it is inadmissible.

Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 666.\n\n861.\n\nThe Applicant has additional contentions under the manifest excess of powers ground regarding the WPT and the Shadow Tax treatment by the Tribunal. The excess of powers which is alluded to relates to the object of the dispute when a tribunal goes beyond the parties' submissions in awarding damages which exceed the amount claimed. The Applicant contends that the Tribunal decided *ultra petita* twice. It first awarded additional compensation in respect of the WPT by increasing the damages awarded for the expropriation by approximately US$ 495 million and an additional US$ 140 million compensation which the Conoco Parties never sought on the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata Association Agreement.1281 Second, the Tribunal granted compensation which was not requested by ConocoPhillips when it excluded the Shadow Tax from the calculation of damages1282 which resulted in an increased compensation of US$ 675 million awarded to the Conoco Parties.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 687, 697, 698; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 372. **A/R-5 [Curtis] / A/R-46 [De Jes\u00fas]**, Decision on Rectification, dated 19 August 2019, (\"*Decision on Rectification*\"), \u00b6 64.2.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 716, 723.\n\n862.\n\nThe Committee disagrees. Conoco in the arbitration sought full reparation of Venezuela's unlawful expropriation of the Projects, requesting no less than US$ 16.010 billion for historical losses up to the date of the Award, US$ 5.276 billion for lost profits from the date of the Award to the expiration of the Association Agreements, including post-award interest, and a declaration that the amount awarded is net of taxes.1283 While the Committee agrees that awarding unrequested remedies goes beyond the parties' reliefs sought, this is not the case here. The amounts awarded are without contestation within the relief sought.1284 The conclusion is that the Tribunal acted plainly within the scope of its authority.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 202.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 1010, **A/R-5 [Curtis] / A/R-46 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Decision on Rectification*, \u00b6 64.\n\n863.\n\nThe Applicant's final challenge regarding the PEG is that the Tribunal arbitrarily disregarded the applicable law by ignoring the fact that the PEG was established by the Congressional Authorization and incorporated into the Profit Sharing Agreement, which formed the legal framework defining Conoco's rights in the Corocoro Project.1285 The excess of powers complained of relates to the legal norms applied by the Tribunal to the PEG, which was a special agreement within the meaning of Article 9(5) of the Treaty.1286 It is trite law that under Article 52(1)(b), a manifest excess of powers may arise when an arbitral tribunal decides claims under a different category of legal norms than those contemplated by the parties' agreement for the dispute.1287\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 755; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 411.

The Applicant's argument is accordingly meritless. The Tribunal did not apply any other legal norms to the PEG as it had excluded this factor from the damage calculation due to insufficient information.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n865.\n\nThe Applicant alludes to an absence of rational explanation regarding the award of US$ 140 million under the compensation provisions of the Petrozuata Association Agreement, despite the fact the ICC tribunal had already determined that the WPT was not a Discriminatory Action.1288 The Committee notes that Conoco argued that the WPT was contrary to international law as it artificially reduced Venezuela's compensation obligation by taking away the benefit of much of the increase in value of the investment due to improved market conditions between the dates of expropriation and valuation,1289and that \"*by no means established that the WPT was a wrongful act*.\"1290 The Tribunal also did not find a case for an exemption from the WPT statute which Conoco claimed, would have made the royalty inapplicable by operation of law.1291 The Tribunal remarked that Conoco's arguments on exemption \"*nonetheless do not rely on the very specific provisions on discriminatory action contained in the Association Agreements of Petrozuata and Hamaca*.\"1292 The Tribunal then concluded that the WPT was applicable to the Projects, as there is \"[n]*o case for an exemption has been demonstrated or supported by evidence. The potential relevance of the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements of Petrozuata and Hamaca remains to be examined at a later stage.*\"1293 The Tribunal found at a later stage that the WPT Law provides for unequal treatment from the viewpoint of the rules of the Petrozuata Association Agreements which, \"*when using the expression 'equally applies' does not distinguish depending whether such circumstance is legal or illegal. The simple fact of unequal treatment, including unequal treatment based on the law, is sufficient to cause the situation to become a discriminatory action*.\"1294 The Tribunal thus explained why it awarded damages for the WPT after finding the tax lawful.1295\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 693.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 729.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 757.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 729.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 765.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 766.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 783.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 701 (i).\n\n866.\n\nThe Tribunal explained how it awarded damages for the WPT under the compensation provisions of the Association Agreements without contradictory reasons or the need to give any additional reasons as Venezuela claims, including reasons based on the ICC award which the Tribunal had no obligation to mention.1296\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 701 (iii) and (iv), 702.\n\n867.\n\nThe Applicant says that there is no plausible explanation for ignoring the treatment by both sides of the Budget Price.1297 The Tribunal explained that ConocoPhillips' non-objection to the application of the WPT made by Venezuela's experts must be understood in the context of Conoco's instructions to its experts not to examine the WPT.1298 The inclusion by Conoco's experts of Venezuela's expert valuation assumption of the Budget Price was only made for, as the Applicant remarks, \"*a sensitivity showing how their ex post valuation assuming that the Discriminatory Action provisions did not apply would be affected if the Windfall Profits Tax was applicable to the Projects*.\"1299\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 701 (ii).\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 767.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 691.\n\n868.\n\nThe fixing of the Budget Price which determines the minimum level at which the WPT can operate was made by the Tribunal within the limits of the debate presented by the Parties in the following terms which appear at paragraph 771 of the Award:\n\n\"*A cursory look at the rare budget explanations found on the Tribunal's record demonstrates the political and economic component of the Budget Price. When this price was set at US$ 60 in the years 2014 and 2015, it was said that with such price, the expectations and the uncertainties of the international oil market were valued, also taking into account the vulnerability of oil prices. For these two years, the Venezuelan Basket Price was US$ 88.54 in 2014 and US$ 44.69 in 2015. Noting the decrease of prices in 2015, the Government must have been sensitive to the potential over pricing of the Budget Price in 2015. This had a strong consequence in year 2016, when the Basket Price went down to US$ 32.02: The Government took the Budget Price down to US$ 40, explaining this was a consequence of the decrease of crude oil prices on international markets. This experience demonstrates that a Budget Price of US$ 40 is manifestly linked to a period of low market prices, when the Government must be careful not to raise taxes above reasonable proportions. The stability of the fiscal regime confronted with highly volatile pricing was also a consideration. Thus, when the Budget Price was set at US$ 40 in 2011, it was with the intention of taking maximum profit from increasing prices, but this approach was then corrected in 2012 when it was noted that a more prudent approach was to be preferred, resulting in a price level of US$ 50 that was further raised to US$ 55 in year 2013, before it went up again in 2014 to US$ 60. Therefore, when in years after 2016, prices went up or can be expected to go up again it is unconvincing to retain a low Budget Price of US$ 40 for all future years as a flat rate. The Respondent's experts have no explanation for their assumption that such a flat price would apply until the end of the life of the Projects. Their position is untenable when contrasted to the Budget Price the same experts had adopted two years earlier: Indeed, in their calculations annexed to their Second Report of 7 January 2015 and to their Expert Report of 18 August 2014, the Budget Price was set at a flat level of US$ 60 as from 2014 and until the end of the Projects. Therefore, these experts' own assumptions support a view that the Budget Price of US$ 40 was exceptional for the low-price year of 2016, while prices as experienced in 2014 and 2015 (between US$ 45 and 90) can have the effect of raising the Budget Price to the level of about US$ 60, in order not to overcharge the financial benefit of oil production in Venezuela. The Tribunal concludes that the most reasonable assumption of the Budget Prices retained as from year 2017 is US$ 60, which corresponds to the actual price in the years 2014 and 2015 and to the amount the Respondent's experts have envisaged before oil prices crashed in 2016*.\"1300\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 771.\n\n869.\n\nThe Applicant' view is that this reasoning is impossible to follow, full of contradictions and even incorrect.1301 However, the complaint about correctness is no ground in support of a challenge under Article 52(1)(e). As is well established in the decisions of the *ad hoc* committees, evaluating the correctness of the reasons draws a committee into reviewing the substance of the decision. Contradictory reasons which cancel each other out should be distinguished from dissatisfaction with the reasons expressed in the award.1302\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 688; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 389.\n\n*Duke Energy Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 166.\n\n870.\n\nThe Committee finds nothing contradictory in the Tribunal's explanation in paragraph 771 of its Award. The Tribunal criticized Venezuela, not for using a flat rate *per se* from 2016 through the end of the Projects, but for a flat rate fixed at US$40. There is no contradiction with the Tribunal's use of a flat rate of US$60.1303 The Tribunal had examined and explained how the Budget Price was fixed and linked to the low market price of crude (in fact at its lowest) and that when such prices went up it is reasonable to expect that the Budget Price would then be revised upwards. It came to a view that the \"*most reasonable assumption of the Budget Prices retained as from year 2017 is US$ 60, which corresponds to the actual price in the years 2014 and 2015 and to the amount the Respondent's experts have envisaged before oil prices crashed in 2016*\".1304 The Applicant may not like the reasoning but reasons expressed by the Tribunal are clear and unassailable.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 682.\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 771.\n\n871.\n\nThe Applicant also attacks the Tribunal's decisions for excluding the Shadow Tax, negative cash flows and the PEG without stating reasons. The Applicant is dissatisfied with the explanation given for the Shadow Tax by the Tribunal at footnote 536 of the Award and wishes to find explanations of the Tribunal's disregard of the Parties' agreement on the applicability of the Shadow Tax.1305 The Applicant also states that the negative cash flows were eliminated without reason despite the Parties' giving them effect in their respective calculations.1306 The Applicant submits that the Tribunal took an unreasoned departure from the agreement of the Parties regarding the application of the PEG for the Corocoro Project.1307\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 724; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 399.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 732; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 403.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 758; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 414.\n\n872.\n\nAs the Committee could not infer any agreement on the Shadow Tax or the PEG from the Parties calculations, there is therefore no basis to expect the Tribunal to decide on or give effect to non-existent factors. The Tribunal explained with sufficient clarity at footnote 536 of the Award that the Shadow Tax had \"*not been explained nor supplied by reference to legal or other sources*\" and at paragraph 721 that, without an analysis of the PEG rate under the Association Agreements, accounting for it \"*would be pure speculation*\". In both cases, the Tribunal stated that the Parties' experts did not provide sufficient evidence or explanations for the consideration of these two factors in the valuation process,1308 a situation which it plainly exposed when discussing the valuation method with the evidence marshalled by the Parties' experts:\n\n*\"The Tribunal further notes that the remedy it will retain must be connected to actual facts and reflect the Tribunal's knowledge. The Award \"shall state the reasons upon which it is based\" (Art. 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i)). Members of the Tribunal must be capable of exercising independent judgment (Art. 14(1), 40(2) ICSID Convention). When reading these provisions together, it means that the opinion of experts must be capable of being translated into reasons to be provided by the Tribunal. Such reasons cannot be based, for instance, on mathematical formulae not accompanied by explanations serving as evidence or reasons of law on which an award can be based. The Tribunal cannot reach conclusions based on simple excel-sheets not accompanied by explanations and incapable of being operated on an interactive mode. This is all the more difficult when the response of the experts is limited to stating that the reports have been prepared following a party's instruction. The Tribunal has on several occasions made the Parties aware of such deficiencies.*\"1309\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 709, 725, 728; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 277 (b).\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 270.\n\n873.\n\nThe Applicant says with regard to the omission of negative cash flows that there is no rationale for excluding the two years during which the negative cash flows occurred.1310 The Committee notes that a calculation error needs no explanations.\n\nTr.

Otherwise, as noted by *ad hoc* committees, the tribunal would never reach the stage of making an award, had it to submit its reasoning to the parties for their observations prior to making the decision.1312 This would exactly happen here if we were to follow the Applicant. The Tribunal fixed the Budget Price in consideration of each Party's expert assumptions and the royalty reference price of US$ 60 and its decision is related to the arguments presented by both sides.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 711, Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 390.\n\n*Tza Yap Shum Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 130-131; *Tulip Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 82.\n\n875.\n\nThe Applicant finally attacks the Tribunal's decisions on the Shadow Tax,1313 the negative cash flows1314 and the PEG1315 for seriously departing from a fundamental rule of procedure because the Tribunal did not return to the Parties for further information. The Tribunal is now criticized for not having given Venezuela an opportunity to clear up any confusion. However, the law under Article 52(1)(d) is that the opportunity to be heard is not an unlimited opportunity to present its case.1316 As the Applicant also hints at the surprise caused to both sides,1317 the Committee's response is that surprise in itself does not justify annulment when,1318 as in this case, the Tribunal's reasoning on the quantum issues is derived from the Parties' arguments.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 725; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 400.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 733.\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 761; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 414.\n\n*Churchill Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 178; **A/CLA-90**, *Bernhard von Pezold and others v.

The Tribunal affirmed that such an approach allowed it to \"place [] the focus on actual terms\"1320 such as the rising oil prices, adding that \"for easily understandable practical reasons, the date of such valuation cannot be the precise date of the Award.\"1321 Venezuela notes that the Tribunal also indicated in the Award that an *ex-post* damages assessment may under specific circumstances be based on projections \"where actual data are either not available or not reliable.\"1322\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 463, citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 263.\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 463, citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 265.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 579, citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 241.\n\n879.\n\nHowever, Venezuela submits that the Tribunal failed to perform the date-of-award valuation it had indicated it would conduct, thereby, manifestly failing to apply the applicable law to the damages assessment. The reconstituted Tribunal considered actual data between the 2007 taking and the Parties' latest update of 30 December 2016, while it only considered projections for 2017 and 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. Yet, according to Venezuela, actual data was available and reliable for 2017, 2018 and 2019, but the Tribunal decided not to ask the Parties for the updated data.1323 A simple reading of the Award reveals this defect as well as the Tribunal's manifest excess of powers.1324\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 580.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 584.\n\n880.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal ignored one of the undisputed quantum inputs, namely the PEG (\"Participaci\u00f3n del Estado en las Ganancias\"). According to Venezuela, the Parties and their experts agreed that in the but-for scenario, a 50% PEG tax would have had to be paid to Venezuela for the Corocoro Project. Yet, the Tribunal disregarded the PEG, thereby failing to apply the applicable law, which resulted in doubling the compensation for the Corocoro Project.1325\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 581.\n\n881.\n\nVenezuela refers to the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Soufraki*, to submit that the Tribunal's decision to ignore the 50% PEG tax is a gross misapplication that \"no reasonable person [\u2026] could accept,\"1326 given the importance of the matter. It maintains that a reasonable person would consider that the Tribunal in making projections should utilise all available actual data No reasonable person would accept an error consisting of refusing to apply a critical factor of quantification -the PEG-when such factor was not disputed by the Parties and their experts.1327\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 582 citing *Soufraki Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 86.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 583.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n882.\n\nVenezuela submits that the Tribunal provided contradictory reasons when it decided not to ask for an update of the data required for *ex-post* valuation, after stating that the date for an *ex-post* valuation cannot be the precise date of the Award.\n\n883.\n\nVenezuela argues that the premise that the date of the valuation cannot coincide with the precise date of the Award is incompatible with the decision to \"not ask for a subsequent update\" of the valuation of damages. The Tribunal decided to rely on obsolete data, which was over two years old and affirmed, without further explanation, that any additional information (had an update been provided) would not have significantly impacted the overall assessment of damages.1328\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 464, 465, citing A **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 265; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 590.\n\n884.\n\nVenezuela observes that the Tribunal indicated it was reluctant to further delay the proceeding by asking for an update. However, it observes that the proceedings continued after the Parties presented their updated quantum reports with projections for 31 December 2016. There were two quantum hearings in 2017 after which the Tribunal asked for quantum reports and in June 2017 it sent questions regarding the quantum phase to the Parties. By not asking for an update, the Tribunal failed to abide by its decision that the valuation date is the date of the Award or to provide adequate reasons for doing so.1329 The Tribunal relied on reasons of \"efficiency\" while stating that the actual data would not have had a significant impact on the overall damages assessment. However, no reasonable reader could understand how the Tribunal concluded that the data it did not possess would not have had a significant impact. If the Tribunal had the data, it would have been obligated to give the Parties an opportunity to opine on it, which it failed to do.1330\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 466.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 590.\n\n885.\n\nOn the PEG, Venezuela submits that the Tribunal failed to state adequate reasons for its decision to ignore the application of the 50% PEG factor in the but-for scenario.1331 Venezuela argues that the Tribunal arbitrarily refused to consider the PEG, claiming that the experts had not discussed part of the contractual documentation. However, the experts agreed to factor in a 50% PEG and neither the experts nor the Parties ever considered that the PEG rate required further examination. For Venezuela, the Tribunal fabricated an excuse to \"examine and determine\" the PEG rate, failing to meet the standard set forth in Article 52(1)(e).1332\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 594.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 594.\n\n886.\n\nVenezuela counters Conoco's defense that the Tribunal considered the application of the PEG too speculative and that the Committee is not empowered to assess the quality of the Tribunal's reasoning. Conoco cannot submit now that they had not agreed to apply the PEG factor, since the Parties' experts and the Parties agreed at all relevant times that the PEG factor was 50%.1333\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 595, 596.\n\n***S****erious** **D****eparture** **F****rom a** **F****undamental** **R****ule of** **P****rocedure***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n887.\n\nVenezuela maintains that the Tribunal's decision not to request an update of the data for an *ex-post* valuation hindered Venezuela's due process right, including its right to be heard and present evidence, without any apparent reason.

The Tribunal simply formed an opinion on the impact of data, which was greater than two years, without ever granting Venezuela an opportunity to provide its own opinion.1335 Venezuela agues that the use of actual data for a period greater than two years would undoubtedly have had an impact on the purported Award valuation. Venezuela argues that Conoco misses the point, and this is not about having an opportunity to be heard on other issues, but about an opportunity to (i) present updated and actual data after 31 December 2016, and before the Award on 8 March 2019; and (ii) be heard on the alleged absence of any such data on the overall valuation made.1336\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 599.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 600, 601.\n\n889.\n\nThe Tribunal also seriously violated Venezuela's right to be heard when it ignored the PEG factor in its valuation. The Tribunal waited until the Award to inform that it had overlooked the PEG factor due to an alleged lack of consideration by the Parties' experts. Venezuela had no opportunity to clarify any questions the Tribunal purportedly needed addressed, even though the Tribunal asked questions regarding the quantum issues at the 2017 Hearing, yet none of these questions referred to the PEG factor. The Tribunal should have afforded the Parties the opportunity to examine and determine the PEG factor and help the Tribunal overcome any difficulties it had on this point.1337\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 603, 604.\n\n**E.2(2) Manifest Excess of Powers; Failure to State Reasons and Serious Departure as argued by Curtis**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n890.\n\nVenezuela submits that the Tribunal not only failed to apply the applicable law but also disregarded the clear understanding of the parties as to the meaning of an *ex-post* (date-of-award) valuation. The Parties disagreed on which post-expropriation events should be considered in the valuation; however, they did not dispute that post-expropriation events not attributable to Venezuela's or PDVSA's conduct or alleged mismanagement of the Projects must be considered.1338\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 661, 662.\n\n891.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal did not conduct any *ex-post* valuation, as it refused to consider historical data for over two years before the date of the Award concerning the field operations, including production, costs and revenues which would have affected the Projects, and effectively applying the valuation date of 30 December 2016 instead of the date-of-award. Furthermore, the Tribunal did not discount the future years to 30 December 2016, but to 1 January 2019, thereby inflating the compensation for the three Projects.1339\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 354.\n\n892.\n\nVenezuela argues, contrary to Conoco's defense, that it is not asking the Committee to assess or question the Tribunal's handling of the evidence or damages calculation.1340 Venezuela emphasized that the key issue is whether the Tribunal was free to disregard years of post-expropriation data in an *ex-post* valuation when the Parties could have submitted an update reasonably close to the date of the Award.1341\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 361, 362.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 363, 364.\n\n***S****erious** **D****eparture** **F****rom a** **F****undamental** **R****ule of** **P****rocedure***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n893.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Tribunal's refusal to accept any update of the valuations with the Award was a serious departure. In the 2017 Hearing, Venezuela emphasized to the Tribunal that the data was outdated and argued that, while it saw no basis for making an *ex-post* valuation, any such valuation, should be a date-of-the-award valuation based on updated data. Venezuela reiterated its position in January 2019 (two months before the Award) regarding the valuation of the Corocoro Project, yet again, the Tribunal refused to update the valuations.1342\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 663-668; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 358.\n\n894.\n\nVenezuela submits that Conoco misconstrues Venezuela's argument on serious departure. For Venezuela, the issue is not, like Conoco posits, if Venezuela had an opportunity to be heard on quantum generally, but whether it was appropriate for the Tribunal to deny Venezuela's right to present an updated valuation considering the changes that occurred in the years since Parties' last valuations. Venezuela notes that the Tribunal specifically denied the opportunity to present updated reports despite Venezuela having reminded the Tribunal at the September 2017 Hearing that an *ex-post* valuation would require a date-of-award valuation with updated reports.1343\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 368, 369.\n\n***F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n895.\n\nVenezuela also argues that the Tribunal failed to state sufficient reasons for its decision not to update the valuations. The reasons given by the Tribunal were to avoid delay and the lack of significant impact of events that occurred between the last data and the date of the Award. In Venezuela's view, for a case that has been going on for over a decade, the avoidance of delay is non-sensical, and it would take only two or three weeks to update the valuations. As to the purported lack of impact, without seeing the data and its effect, the Tribunal could not know at that time what the impact of two, three or even four years of additional data would have on the valuations.1344\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 669, 670; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6 360\n\n896.\n\nVenezuela submits, contrary to Conoco, that \"woefully insufficient\" reasons also warrant annulment, and that the reasons the Tribunal provided are insufficient to justify the Tribunal's failure to accept the updated data to perform the *ex-post* valuation.1345\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 365, 366.\n\n897.\n\nAccording to Venezuela, the Tribunal's only explanation for not discounting the 2017 and 2018 projected cash flows to the effective valuation date of 30 December 2016 (the date of the last quantum submissions), was its assumption that the projections reflected actual events. Venezuela refutes this as it was a period of rapid change in Venezuela, which is why a valuation update was necessary to make a date-of-award valuation. Instead, the Tribunal treated 2017 and 2018 as part of the historical period, even though actual data from that period was not used, and future years were only discounted to 1 January 2019, thereby inflating the value by approximately USD 871 million.1346\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6 671.\n\n898.\n\nVenezuela refutes Conoco's affirmation that the Tribunal adopted the valuation date of 1 January 2019. Venezuela notes that while the Tribunal kept 1 January 2019, as the nominal valuation date and discounted subsequent years to that date, the issue remains: using 1 January 2019 as the valuation date meant that all prior years (including 2017 and 2018) were considered part of the historical period, for which the Tribunal refused to accept the actual data. By declining to accept actual data for much of the historical period and treating it as part of the projection period, the Tribunal effectively used 30 December 2016, as the valuation date.1347\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 367.\n\n**E.2(3) No Annullable Error in the Tribunal's Application of the Valuation Date (Conoco)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***N****o** **M****anifest** **E****xcess of** **P****owers***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n899.\n\nConoco submits that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers when conducting *ex-post* valuation. Venezuela's (Curtis) complaint that the Tribunal failed to consider all post-expropriation events and conditions is a complaint regarding the Tribunal's procedural decisions and treatment of the evidence, which cannot be reviewed on annulment. The Tribunal's *ex-post* valuation falls within the discretion afforded to tribunals in quantifying damages.1348 In its Rejoinder, Conoco submits that *ex-post* valuations rely on projections and adjustments to the \"actual data\" to approximate a hypothetical but-for scenario. Accordingly, in its *ex-post* valuation the Tribunal was not required to consider the actual date from a date close to the date of the Award.1349\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 624.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 232.\n\n900.\n\nFurther, the fact that the Parties did not dispute the principle that post-expropriation events that were not attributable to Venezuela's or PDVSA's conduct or alleged mismanagement of the Projects must be considered, is unrelated to Venezuela's complaint that the Tribunal relied on outdated data to perform its date-of-award quantification of damages. Even if the Parties had agreed to provide the Tribunal with updates for a date-of-award valuation, the Tribunal would not have been bound by that agreement. The tribunals are the sole judges of the admissibility of the evidence and are given considerable discretion to make quantum calculations.1350 While the Tribunal may seek updates on quantum inputs in a decade-long arbitration, it was not required to request such updates until the issuance of the Award, and there is no evidence of an agreement between the Parties that these updates would continue.1351\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 625-627.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 233.\n\n901.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco counters Venezuela's (Curtis) objections concerning disagreements with the Tribunal's conduct of the proceeding. The Tribunal determined that additional quantum submissions were not warranted, as they would require further hearings and cause delay. That was not an excess of powers, less a manifest one. Venezuela disagrees with what the Tribunal viewed as a date as close to the Award as possible which, to Conoco, is a disagreement with the treatment of the evidence, not a manifest excess of powers.1352\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 234.\n\n902.\n\nConoco also counters Venezuela's (De Jes\u00fas) claim that the Tribunal was obligated to base the calculation on actual data instead of projections. For Conoco Venezuela's argument fails because it pertains to an alleged error of law in the Tribunal's calculation of quantum, rather than a matter of applicable law. The argument also fails because Venezuela omits an important quotation, in which the Tribunal notes that *ex post* valuation focuses on actual data \"however, it cannot be conducted without retaining approximate assumptions and projections.\"1353\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 235(b), citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 263; see Counter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 635.\n\n903.\n\nSpecifically, on the PEG, Conoco submits that Venezuela's (De Jes\u00fas) complaints regarding the Tribunal's treatment of the PEG should be deemed waived and disregarded by the Committee, as they were raised for the first time in a reply brief.1354\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 285.\n\n904.\n\nIn any event, Conoco refutes Venezuela's (De Jes\u00fas) argument that the Tribunal's failure to apply the PEG amounts to failure to apply the applicable law. There is no excess of power when a tribunal finds that accounting procedures or contractual provisions have not been adequately substantiated or explained so it would be speculative to apply them.1355 Also, a tribunal is not bound to accept any party's position, concerning the quantum inputs or the overall quantum calculation methodology. The determination of the damage is a matter for the tribunal's informed estimation based on the available evidence.1356\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 290.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 291, 292.\n\n***N****o** **F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n905.\n\nConoco argues that the Tribunal's reasons for not requesting more evidence or submissions on quantum were sufficient and not contradictory. In the Award the Tribunal explained that it was reluctant to further delay the proceeding and that the additional information provided would not have had a significant impact on the overall damages assessment. The Tribunal also explained it was not convinced by Venezuela's arguments at the 2017 Hearing regarding the submission of additional quantum data, noting that Venezuela had the opportunity to make that request a year earlier when the Tribunal sought comments on a draft procedural order at the August 2016 Hearing.1357 Conoco argues that dissatisfaction with the reasoning is not a ground for annulment.1358\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 629.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 237(a).\n\n906.\n\nConoco also submits that the Tribunal's decision was comprehensible and reasonable. Gathering data and allowing the Parties to respond to the other side's submission would have caused a lengthy delay. Conoco illustrates this with the submission of the Parties' experts' consolidated reports in November 2016, which was followed by three hearings, additional charts, tables, expert reports post-hearing briefs, and responses to further quantum-related questions from the Tribunal.1359\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 632; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 237(b).\n\n907.\n\nAlso, there was no contradiction in the Tribunal's statement that an *ex-post* valuation focuses on actual terms and the Tribunal's decision not to order updated quantum data before rendering the date-of-award (*ex-post*) valuation.1360\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 635, citing **A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 263; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 237(c).\n\n908.\n\nVenezuela disputes the merits of the Tribunal's conclusion by arguing that it is unclear how the Tribunal could conclude that additional information would not have had a significant impact on the damages assessment if it had not received that data. This critique, in Conoco's view, disputes the merits of the conclusion. In any event, the Tribunal's decision was sensible since (i) the Tribunal disagreed with Venezuela that actual data from the fields reflected the hypothetical but-for scenario in which the Claimants continued to operate the Projects; and (ii) submission of more quantum data would have caused significant delay.1361\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 239.\n\n909.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco submits that Venezuela seeks to distort the standard for annulment by arguing that insufficient or inadequate reasons are grounds for annulment. However, such a position would give committees the power to assess the quality of reasoning and overturn awards on that basis, which is the opposite of the standard for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).1362\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 238.\n\n910.\n\nAlso, Venezuela's (Curtis) criticism that the Tribunal did not discount the cash flows from 2017 and 2018 is based on the premise that the Tribunal used a valuation date of 30 December 2016, when in fact it adopted 1 January 2019. Therefore, the Tribunal treated the 2017 and 2018 cash flows as part of the historical period to which an update factor (or interest rate) was applied, rather than a discount rate.1363\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 636, 637.\n\n911.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco submits that using estimates rather than actual data for the 2017 and 2018 cash flows does not move the valuation date and does not turn a historical period into a future period. Even if Venezuela was correct (it is not), it would still not give rise to annulment, as it would only amount to an error in the application of the discount and interest rates. Disagreements with computation of damages, even if well-founded, cannot lead to annulment.1364\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 241.\n\n912.\n\nOn the issue of the PEG as argued by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas), Conoco rebuts that the reasons by the Tribunal are easily comprehensible. Conoco argues that although Venezuela disagrees with the reasons provided, there is no absence of reasons.1365\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 296.\n\n***N****o** **S****erious** **D****eparture** **F****rom a** **F****undamental** **R****ule of** **P****rocedure***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n913.\n\nThe Tribunal did not violate Venezuela's right to be heard by not seeking additional evidence or submissions on the quantum issues before rendering its Award. Conoco submits that Venezuela was afforded \"extraordinary, and perhaps unprecedented opportunities to be heard on the quantum calculation\"1366 and recounts the instances in which Venezuela made submissions on the issue of quantum. The right to be heard requires an equal opportunity to present one's case, not that a guarantee that every request to submit additional evidence will be granted. The Tribunal is charged with deciding on the admissibility of evidence and procedural directions, which decisions are not reviewable on annulment.1367\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 639.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 641.\n\n914.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco notes that the parties made in total no fewer than 18 submissions in the quantum phase of the arbitration, excluding additional expert reports. Conoco again submits that due process requires the tribunal to provide the parties with an adequate opportunity to present their case, it does not require that a party be given \"an unlimited opportunity to present its case.\"1368\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 242.\n\n915.\n\nOn the PEG issue, Conoco submits Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) had no right to preview the Tribunal's quantum decisions or to provide additional submissions before the issuance of the Award. The Tribunal was free to adopt the valuation method it considered appropriate in circumstances where Venezuela failed to substantiate its position.1369\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 297.\n\n**E.2(4) The Committee's Analysis of the Grounds Related to the Tribunal's Findings on Valuation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**E.2(4)(1) Committee's Analysis of Grounds Invoked as Argued by Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n916.\n\nThe Applicant declares that the Tribunal used obsolete data for the period between 1 January 2017 and the Award date of 8 March 2019 although it determined that damages had to be assessed *ex post* based on actual terms on or about the date of the Award. Actual data was available for 2017, 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 when the Tribunal closed the proceedings and decided not to request them from the Parties. The Applicant contends that the Tribunal's decision to consider actual data for the years between the taking and 30 December 2016 and projections for the years 2017, 2018 as well as the first quarter of 2019 constitutes a misapplication of customary international law applicable to the assessment of damages.1370 The Applicant contends that the Tribunal disregarded the law applicable to valuation by ignoring the PEG and doubled compensation for the Corocoro Project. The Applicant criticizes the Tribunal's failure to apply a critical quantification that in the Tribunal's opinion required further examination and determination, despite there being no dispute between the Parties and their experts that the PEG factor was 50%.1371\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 465-466; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 576-577, 580.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 581, 583-584.\n\n917.\n\nThe Applicant next argues that the Tribunal failed to state adequate reasons for its decisions not to request actual data and to ignore the PEG rate. The Applicant argues that there is no explanations for how the Tribunal could base its valuation on outdated data rather than actual data, while simultaneously stating that the actual data would not have significantly impacted its overall situation. The Tribunal made contradictory statements by emphasizing focus on actual terms while relying on information over two years old. Likewise, the Tribunal arbitrarily refused to consider the PEG, based on the reason that the Parties' experts who agreed to factor 50% PEG in the valuation of damages had not discussed part of the contractual documentation. However, the Tribunal failed to explain how a consideration by the Parties' expert of contractual documents they had not needed to determine the PEG factor at 50% would have had an impact on their assessment.1372\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 592, 594, 596.\n\n918.\n\nLastly, the Applicant contends that its right to be heard has been violated because it was prevented from presenting actual data with a period of more than two years. The Applicant argues that the period in question was critical for the Tribunal's date-of-award valuation, and the use of actual data for more than two years would have had a significant impact on the purported date-of-award valuation. Similarly, the Tribunal should have offered the Parties an opportunity to examine and determine the PEG factor to assist the Tribunal in understanding this aspect of the dispute.1373\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 467; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 599, 600, 604.\n\n919.\n\nConoco points out that Venezuela only raised the argument on PEG in its Reply Memorial.1374 The Committee views the contention as a new argument that does not fall out of the alleged grounds for annulment and observes that Conoco does not claim that its rights of defense have been jeopardized by the further arguments in the Applicant's Reply.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 285.\n\n920.\n\nThe Committee wishes to emphasize that correcting the wrongful application of the law and redressing legal errors escapes its remit under Article 52. The Applicant engages in a plain review of the merits of the Award when it discusses the valuation factors used by the Tribunal. It even acknowledges doing so when it denounces the treatment of PEG by the Tribunal as \"*an error consisting in refusing to apply a critical factor of quantification on the basis that it needed to be further examined and determined when there was no dispute amongst the Parties and their experts on this very same factor*.\"1375\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 583.\n\n921.\n\nUnder the guise of a \"*manifest egregious misapplication of the proper law*,\"1376 the Applicant discusses the merits of the Tribunal's decision (at paragraph 265 of the Award) and accuses the Tribunal of failing to ask the Parties for a subsequent update of their *ex post* valuations after 31 December 2016 as well as for an analysis of the PEG rate under the Association Agreements Accounting Procedures (at paragraph 721 of the Award). As observed by Conoco, these questions relate to the decision on the inputs that were to be used.1377 The Applicant's allegation for a failure to state reasons by the Tribunal is nothing but a plain refusal to accept the Tribunal's reasons on the PEG (at paragraph 721) or on subsequent updates (at paragraph 265) that it had decided not to ask for subsequent updates because it was \"*reluctant to engage in a further delay in the proceedings and considering that the additional information they provide would not have had a significant impact on the overall assessment of damages*\".\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 579.\n\nTr.

The last actual production data for the three Projects were from December 2015, so as the last actual cost data for the Upgrading Projects, and the last actual costs for the Corocoro Project were from December 2013. The last actual price, inflation and exchange rate data used in the expert reports were from mid-2016. By treating 2017 and 2018 as part of the historical period even though those years were based on projections rather than actual historical data, and by not discounting those and subsequent cash flows to 31 December 2016, the Applicant alleges that the Tribunal inflated damages by almost US$ 871 million.1379\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 649, 652, 660; Reply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 354.\n\n924.\n\nBy conducting an *ex-post* valuation without taking into account major post-expropriation events, such as hyperinflation after 2016 that have an impact on the value up to the date of the award, the Applicant alleges that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers. In particular, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law and disregarded the clear understanding between the parties that *ex post* valuation entails a valuation as of the date of the Award. The Applicant argues that the Tribunal's failure to accept the updated data constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Lastly, it was argued by the Applicant that the Tribunal introduced a nonsensical excuse of avoiding delay when updating would not have exceeded a few weeks and gave no reason for its arbitrary assumption that the updates would have no significant impact.1380 The Applicant wraps up its arguments as a question \"*not whether it was necessary to have an update precisely on the date of the Award; it is whether the tribunal was free to disregard years of data when it was perfectly possible for the parties to provide an update reasonably close to the date of the Award*.\"1381\n\nMemorial (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 658, 661-662, 664, 668.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 363.\n\n925.\n\nBefore answering, it is useful to read the impugned passage of paragraph 265 of the Award where the Tribunal explained:\n\n\"*One of the characteristics of an ex post valuation is that for easily understandable practical reasons, the date of such valuation cannot be the precise date of the Award. The Tribunal has instructed the Parties in Procedural Order No. 4 to provide their ex post valuations on damages updated on 31 December 2016 (para. 6). The Parties have prepared their submissions accordingly. The Tribunal has decided not to ask for a subsequent update, being reluctant to engage in a further delay of the proceeding, and considering that the additional information then provided would not have had a significant impact on the overall assessment of damages. Therefore, the assessment of relevant evidence between early 2017 and the date of this Award is based on the information and projections available for the preceding period and the up-date requested for 31 December 2016.*\"1382\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6 265*.*\n\n926.\n\n*Ad hoc* committees have early recognized that the right to be heard is one of the affected rules of procedure under Article 52(1)(d).1383 The right to be heard includes notably the right for a party to propose evidence on pertinent facts. The right to be heard must be \"*interpreted reasonably, namely as requiring tribunals to provide each party with an adequate opportunity to be heard but not necessarily with an unlimited opportunity to present its case. In this perspective, the right to be heard is commonly considered as not absolute, but rather subject to possible limitations, provided that they are reasonable and proportional to the aim to be achieved*.\"1384 This is exactly what the Tribunal did. It spelled out its refusal of other opportunities \"*being reluctant to engage in a further delay of the proceeding, and considering that the additional information then provided would not have had a significant impact on the overall assessment of damages*.\"1385\n\n**A/RLA-150 [Curtis] / A/RLA-73 [De Jes\u00fas]** , *Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

It refused them only after giving Venezuela the opportunity to express its views, submit arguments and to prove its factual allegation on quantum.1386 A tribunal may refuse to admit evidence without violating the right to be heard if the fact is already established or if the evidence is without pertinence to the issue at hand. During the underlying arbitration, the Tribunal made clear that the result of the evidence proposed would not have modified its assessment of damages.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 639-640.\n\n928.\n\nThe Applicant denounces the reasons provided by the Tribunal as woefully insufficient when it was perfectly possible for the parties to provide an update reasonably close to the date of the Award, and further hearings and delays do not mean that the Tribunal could disregard years of expropriation data in an *ex post* valuation.1387 The Committee observes that the binding nature of ICSID awards at Article 53 would be illusory if they could be overturned in all cases where the losing party would consider the rightfulness of its arguments as self-evident.\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6\u00b6 363, 366.\n\n929.\n\nThe Committee's response is that under the guise of arguments of manifest excess of powers, violation of the right to be heard, and failure to state reasons, the Applicant is effectively challenging the Tribunal's decision on the admission of new evidence and its evaluation of the probative value of the evidence presented, both of which escapes the Committee's review under Article 52.1388\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Duke Energy Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 258; *Teinver Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 175.\n\n**F. ANNULMENT OF THE AWARD ON COSTS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n930.\n\nThe summary of Venezuela's (Curtis) arguments in relation to the Award on Costs is in **Section F.1**; the summary of Venezuela's (De Jes\u00fas) arguments on that issue is in **Section F.2**; the summary of Conoco's arguments is in **Section F.3** and Committee's analysis is in **Section F.4**.\n\n**F.1 Annulment of the Award on costs (Curtis)**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n931.\n\nVenezuela (Curtis) notes that most of the annulment grounds apply to the entire Award. As such, if the Award is annulled in its entirety on any of the grounds for such annulment, the entire costs award should also be annulled.1389\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 452.\n\n**F.2 Annulment of the Award on Costs (DE Jes\u00fas)**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n932.\n\nVenezuela's (De Jes\u00fas) position is that if the Committee annuls any Award or the Decisions, or any part thereof, the premises on which the Tribunal grounded the costs decision would cease to exist. Venezuela notes that the Tribunal adopted the costs follow the event approach, considering that the Claimants had prevailed in most of their claims. Yet a total or partial annulment of the Award or the impugned Decisions would have the effect of annulling the premises that justified the costs follow the event approach and thereby the decision on costs. On this point, Venezuela refers to the annulment decisions issued in *MINE* and in *TECO*.1390\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 471-478, citing *MINE Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 6.112 and *TECO Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 358-362 (emphasis added) (citations omitted); Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 606.\n\n933.\n\nVenezuela submits that the Committee would not be drawing the legal consequences arising from its own findings if it partially annulled the Award but kept the Tribunal's decision on costs intact. Venezuela's argument is that the premise on which the Tribunal based its decision on costs would cease to exist if the Committee annulled the Award. That premise consists in the Tribunal's application of the costs follow the event principle, specifically, the premise that the Conoco Parties had partially succeeded in most of their claims.1391 Besides, if the Committee also annulled the Tribunal's costs decision, the Parties would have the opportunity under Arbitration Rule 55(3) to resubmit the case, including on the issue of costs. This approach would also be consistent with Convention Article 61, which entrusts the decision on the costs of the arbitration to the tribunals, not the committees.1392\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 608.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 609.\n\n**F.3 No Annulment of the Award on Costs (Conoco)**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n934.\n\nConoco submits that the request to annul the decision on costs in case of partial or total annulment of the Award should be rejected. Conoco notes that Venezuela has failed to identify any annulment ground under Article 52 or any other basis to substantiate its request. Conoco argues that when applying the costs follow the event approach the Tribunal also considered the Parties' conduct and the outcome of the proceedings as a whole. Conoco argues that if the Committee annulled the Award in part, the Claimants would remain the successful party in the arbitration and as such the costs decision should remain unaltered. Conoco refers to the annulment decisions in *Pey Casado v. Chile* and *Enron v. Argentina*, in which the committees upheld the decisions on costs even after partially annulled the awards.1393\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 783-787, referring to *Pey Casado Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 354; and **A/RLA-63 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Annulment, 30 July 2010, (\"*Enron Annulment Decision*\"), \u00b6 417; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 313.\n\n935.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Conoco submits that Venezuela fails to engage with the principle that the Tribunal had the discretion to award costs. *MINE* and *TECO*, on which Venezuela relies, are outliers in the jurisprudence. If the justification for a costs award based on the cost-follow-the event principle ceased to exist with a partial annulment, as Venezuela argues, then committees that have partially annulled awards but have left the costs award undisturbed have all erred.1394\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6 314.\n\n**F.4 The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n936.\n\nThe Applicant requests annulment of the cost section of the Award as a necessary consequence of any partial annulment of the Award. It explains that the Tribunal following \"*the costs follow the event*\" approach allocated the costs between the Parties.1395 The Applicant grounds its argument on fairness and unjust enrichment considerations. It contends that there would be no basis to entitle Conoco to the amount of its legal fees and costs that Venezuela was ordered to contribute if part of the Award, on which the Tribunal based its apportionment, were annulled by the Committee.1396\n\n**A/R-1 [Curtis] / A/R-42 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *Award*, \u00b6\u00b6 987-1004.\n\nReply [De Jes\u00fas], \u00b6 608.\n\n937.\n\nProvided that one of the grounds in Article 52 exists,1397there is nothing in the ICSID Convention that would prevent annulment of costs decisions notwithstanding the arbitrators' wide discretion to allocate them under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.1398 The Applicant's contention pertains to the costs section of the Award, specifically addressing the consequences of partial annulment on this section, rather than defects within it that might justify an annulment ground. As Conoco points out, a partial annulment does not automatically lead to an annulment of the cost section of the award.1399 However, if the annulled part of the award affects another section of the award on which the latter is premised, this other section cannot be allowed to stand. The consequences on the scope of annulment between interrelated parts of the award have been highlighted as early as in the *MINE* Decision, where it was decided that the costs section cannot survive the annulment of the part of the award to which it has an inseparable link.1400 Whenever the basis for one section such as the costs section has disappeared because of the annulment of the part of the award on which it was premised, annulment of such interrelated section necessarily follows.1401\n\n*TECO Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 359.\n\n*Kilic Annulment Decision*, \u00b6 195.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 785-786, citing *Tidewater Annulment Decision,* \u00b6 230; *Occidental Annulment Decision*, Section IX; **A/RLA-69 [De Jes\u00fas]**, *CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

See *Enron Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 416-417 for an absence of such implication when partial annulment is not the logical premise of the findings of the costs section.\n\n938.\n\nHere, the Committee annulled no part of the Award. The Applicant's claim is accordingly moot.\n\n**G. COSTS OF THE ANNULMENT PROCEEDING**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**G.1 Allocation of the Costs of the Annulment Proceeding (Curtis)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n939.\n\nIn its submissions on costs, Venezuela (Curtis) argues that the costs of this annulment proceeding should be awarded against Conoco.1402 The Applicant has submitted the following claims for legal and other costs (excluding advances made to ICSID):\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **CATEGORY** | **TOTAL HOURS** | **BILLED AMOUNTS (US$)** |\n| Partners | 6,009.00 | 4,110,650.00 |\n| Associates | 5,520.00 | 1,745,753.75 |\n| Counsel | 814.00 | 434,852.25 |\n| Paralegals | 1,265.00 | 253,138.00 |\n| **TOTAL TIME CHARGED** | **13,608.00** | **6,544,394.00** |\n| Quadrant Economics |  | 50,131.00 |\n| Travel and Other Charges |  | 100,547.67 |\n| ICSID Application Fee |  | 25,000.00 |\n|  |  |  |\n| **TOTAL COSTS CLAIMED** |  | **6,720,072.67** |\n\nReply (Curtis), \u00b6 454.\n\n**G.2 Allocation of the Costs of the Annulment Proceeding (De Jes\u00fas)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n940.\n\nIn its submissions, Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) argues that Conoco should pay all of the Applicant's costs associated with the annulment proceedings, including the Committee's fees and expenses and all legal fees and expenses incurred by Venezuela.1403 Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) adds that Conoco has purposefully increased the Applicant's costs by distorting the reality of facts surrounding the request to lift the stay of enforcement of the Award.1404 Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) also requests an order that Conoco pay interest as deemed appropriate by the Committee between its decision on costs and the date on which the amount will be effectively paid to Venezuela. Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) has submitted the following claims for legal and other costs (excluding advances made to ICSID):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **ITEM** | **AMOUNT (USD)** |\n| Legal fees | USD 8,715,275 |\n| Institutional Costs | USD 1,025,000 |\n| Expenses | USD 30,332 *(EUR 27,842-EUR/USD = 1.089)* |\n| **TOTAL** | **USD 9,770,607** |\n\nMemorial (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 482, 483; Reply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6 621.\n\nReply (De Jes\u00fas), \u00b6\u00b6 622, 623.\n\n**G.3 Allocation of the Costs of the Annulment Proceeding (Conoco)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n941.\n\nIn its submissions on costs,1405 the Conoco Parties submit that Venezuela should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings, including Conoco's legal fees and costs. The Conoco Parties argue first that unsuccessful applicants are, according to *ad hoc* committee's numerous decisions, required to pay all or part of the prevailing's party costs. Second, they argue that holding Venezuela, which has sought annulment of every ICSID award rendered against it since 2003, accountable for the costs will discourage future abusive requests for annulment.1406 The Conoco Parties further add that Venezuela's approach of raising any argument without regard either for the coherence or accuracy of the allegation or the number of times the argument has been tested and rejected has driven costs up. The Respondents on Annulment further allude to Venezuela's unfounded accusations of bad faith behaviour in intentionally misleading the Committee with respect to its receipt of OFAC authorizations to enforce the Award before November 2020 as another basis for awarding it an indemnity of costs.1407\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 788-793; Rejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 315-318.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 791-793.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 316-317.\n\n942.\n\nThe Conoco Parties have submitted the following claims for legal and other costs:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Incurred amount (US$)** |\n| **Legal fees** |\n| Freshfields US LLP1408 | 892,691.10 (Stay)1409 4,838,963.04 (Annulment) **5,731,654.14 (Total)** |\n| Three Crowns LLP | 531,599.50 |\n| **Total legal fees** | **6,263,253.64** |\n| **Disbursements and other charges** |\n| Freshfields US LLP | 94,922.76 |\n| Three Crowns LLP | 25,413.59 |\n| Claimants' Travel & Expenses | 26,265.77 |\n| Hearing graphics vendor | 51,119.10 |\n| **Total disbursements and other charges** | **197,721.22** |\n| **Total costs claimed (Stay) Total costs claimed (Annulment) GRAND TOTAL** | **892,691.10 5,568,283.76 6,460,974.86** |\n\nIncludes legal fees for Mr. King.\n\nFreshfields's legal fees are broken down into: (*i*) those relating to lifting the stay of enforcement (***Stay***); and (*ii*) those relating to responding to the annulment application (***Annulment***). *See* Decision on the Applicant's Request to Continue the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 2 November 2020, \u00b6 69 (\"[\u2026] all questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Committee and of the Parties in connection with this request are reserved for subsequent determination, together with the Application for Annulment\").\n\n**G.4 The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n943.\n\nThe Committee approved on 23 November 2023 the Parties' proposals communicated on 17 November (Conoco), 18 November (Curtis) and 20 November 2023 (De Jesus) to file on 15 December 2023 simultaneous submissions on the costs of the annulment proceedings. Each submission would consist of a summary table of costs incurred, accompanied by a certification from counsel that the summary is complete and accurate, without any need for underlying documentation unless subsequently requested by the Committee.\n\n944.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n945.\n\nThis provision, together with Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applied by virtue of Arbitration Rule 53) gives the Committee discretion to allocate all costs of the proceeding, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n946.\n\nVenezuela and Conoco submit that the other party should bear all the costs and expenses associated with these proceedings and all the costs of the other party's legal representation. The Parties have adopted an approach of the apportionment of costs relying on the cost-follow-the-event principle. The underlying policy of this principle is to compensate the winner. Venezuela's grievances against the Award have all been rejected as well as its Request to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award. Therefore, Conoco should not have consequently been put to the cost of defending itself in an unmeritorious annulment.\n\n947.\n\nConoco declares that having the Applicant bear the burden of all costs will dissuade Venezuela from abusing any longer the annulment process to seek escape from the numerous awards made against it or defer its payment obligations.1410 The Committee accepts that compensation alone is not the only objective of imposing costs on the losing party. Another objective concerns the enforcement of the basic policies of the review of awards in the ICSID Convention aiming at the preservation of the integrity and quality of ICSID arbitration. The deterrent effect Conoco seeks is aimed less at discouraging potential parties from challenging awards to delay enforcement and more at condemning Venezuela's general conduct in ICSID arbitration since 2003. However, that does not come within the Committee's consideration since it needs only consider factors germane to the annulment of the Award of 8 March February 2019 in allocating costs.\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 793.\n\n948.\n\nIt is certain that parties will incur legal costs whenever the Article 52 annulment mechanism is triggered. As acknowledged by Conoco, to bring an annulment proceeding under Article 52 is within the parties' rights.1411 The question is how to hold the balance between the interests of the opposing parties. Conoco suggests that Venezuela's \"scorched earth\" approach substantially increased the costs. Added to that is its baseless allegations that Conoco was not in possession of OFAC authorizations to enforce the Award prior to receiving the Committee's Decision on the stay of enforcement of 2 November 2020, which is disproved by Conoco in its letter to the Committee of 17 June 2021.1412 Bearing in mind that in the Decision of 2 November 2020 the Committee expressly warned the Parties that it will take their comportment into consideration for the apportionment of the costs in these proceedings.1413\n\nCounter-Memorial (Conoco), \u00b6 792.\n\nRejoinder (Conoco), \u00b6\u00b6 316-317.\n\nSee also message from the Committee to the Parties dated 3 March 2021.\n\n949.\n\nCosts are fact-sensitive to the issues raised and the way these issues are run. Whether counsel in the annulment proceedings also represented parties in the arbitration is a not insignificant factor in cost assessment. The Conoco Parties are represented by the same counsel and the re-run of already tested and rejected arguments could not have significantly enhanced their costs; there were no novel issues raised for annulment purposes. There is no evidence that Venezuela conducted its arguments on annulment by attrition, even if their appellate nature in many instances has extended and added to the length of the proceeding.\n\n950.\n\nIt remains that compensation of the successful party includes the costs incurred for the maintenance of a defence, such as Conoco's, that is meritorious. The Committee finds no sign of Conoco's bad faith conduct in the proceeding that would have justified the awarding costs of the proceeding or legal fees against it. Venezuela (De Jes\u00fas) has in particular brought no evidence to show that it incurred increased costs or legal fees due to Conoco's production of the OFAC license, which was required by the Committee before it ultimately decided to discontinue the stay of enforcement as requested by Conoco1414 in satisfaction with the document provided.1415\n\nEmail from the Committee to the Parties dated 29 September 2021.\n\nEmail from the Committee to the Parties dated 26 July 2021: \"The Committee is of the view that the relationship between the Conoco Parties, ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company is sufficiently clarified. Any ambiguity among these entities have now been dispelled and we therefore see no necessity to require another license from OFAC which would be delivered to ConocoPhillips, as proposed by Venezuela in its reply comments of 23 July 2021. We remind that the focus was on the scope of application of the OFAC license to the Conoco Parties as stated in the Decision of 2 November 2020 and pertinently underscored by Venezuela in its previous correspondence (letters of 5 and 26 February, 21 May 2021).\"\n\n951.\n\nIn determining the level of costs that Conoco could recover, the Committee should be responsive to the actual costs incurred by the Respondent in its defence. Notably, the legal costs and expenses are proportionate (Venezuela (Curtis): USD 6,544,394; Conoco: USD 6,263,253.64). The incremental difference with Venezuela's additional costs (De Jes\u00fas) (USD 8,715,275) can be explained by De Jes\u00fas's non-involvement in the initial arbitration and the work that had been expanded by counsel to familiarise themselves with the case. Venezuela makes no complaint about how Conoco ran its defence and does not seek recovery of wasted costs.\n\n952.\n\nThe Committee therefore holds that Venezuela, having failed on all grounds to annul the Award, has to bear the legal fees and expenses of its representations and shall compensate Conoco for its legal representation costs and expenses (USD 6,460,974.86) spent in defending itself against an unsuccessful challenge of the Award. Venezuela shall also bear the costs of the annulment proceeding, including the costs of the application for the stay of enforcement and those of the application for representation which were reserved with the Application for Annulment, which are detailed below. Its request of interest on the costs to be paid by Conoco is consequently rejected.\n\n953.\n\nThe costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):1416\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Committee Members' fees and expenses | 881,538.87 |\n| ICSID's administrative fee | 249,324.28 |\n| Direct expenses | 193,147.16 |\n| Other expenses | 22,557.99 |\n| **Total** | **1,346,568.30** |\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account.\n\n954.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Republic of Venezuela pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 15(5).1417\n\nThe remaining balance, if any, will be reimbursed to the Applicant.\n\n955.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee orders the Applicant, as represented by Curtis and as represented by De Jes\u00fas, to bear their own respective costs and all costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses of USD 1,346,568.30 and USD 6,460,974.86 to cover the legal fees and expenses of the Respondents on Annulment.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n956.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committee unanimously hereby orders as follows:\n\n1. Venezuela's Applications to annul the Award are dismissed;\n\n2. Venezuela shall bear their own costs, fees, and the costs of the annulment proceedings (USD 1,346,568.30) and shall pay the Respondents on Annulment USD 6,460,974.86 for legal fees and for expenses.\n\n3. All other claims and requests are dismissed."}]}
