The Claimant is owned by Pacific Rim Mining Corporation (also called \"Pacific Rim\"), a legal person organized under the laws of Canada. In these arbitration proceedings, the Claimant advances several claims against the Respondent both on its own behalf and on behalf of its subsidiary companies, collectively described as the \"Enterprises.\"\n\n2.\n\n*The Enterprises* : The Enterprises are legal persons organized under the laws of the Respondent, namely: (i) Pacific Rim El Salvador, Sociedad An\u00f3nima de Capital Variable (also called \"PRES\"), with its principal office at 5 Avda. Norte, No. 16, Barrio San Antonio, Sensuntepeque, Caba\u00f1as, El Salvador; and (ii) Dorado Exploraciones, Sociedad An\u00f3nima de Capital Variable (also called \"DOREX\"), with its principal office at the same address. PRES is the owner of certain rights in the mining areas denominated as \"El Dorado Norte,\" \"El Dorado Sur \" and \"Santa Rita,\" and DOREX is the owner of certain rights in the mining areas denominated as \"Huacuco,\" \"Pueblos\" and \"Guaco.\" These mining areas are located in Caba\u00f1as and San Vicente, in the northern part of El Salvador.\n\n3.\n\n*ICSID & CAFTA* : The Claimant is a national of a Contracting State to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"ICSID Convention\"), namely the USA. The USA is a Contracting State to the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (\"CAFTA\"), in force for the USA as from August 2005.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s legal representatives are Arif H. Ali, R. Alexandre de Gramont, R. Timothy McCrum, and Theodore Posner Esqs, all of Crowell & Moring LLP, 101 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington DC 20004, USA.\n\n5.\n\n*The Respondent* : The Respondent is the Republic of El Salvador. For present purposes, the relevant Ministries of the Respondent\u2019s Government are (i) the Ministry of Economy, *Ministerio de Econom\u00eda*, (also called \"MINEC\"); and (ii) the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, *Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales* (also called \"MARN\"); and the relevant division within MINEC is the National Office of Investments, *Oficina Nacional de Inversiones* (also called \"ONI\").\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent is a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention. It is a Contracting State to CAFTA, in force for the Respondent as from March 2006.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s legal representatives are Lic. Romeo Benjam\u00edn Barahona, Fiscal General de la Rep\u00fablica, Fiscal\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica, Final 48 Calle Oriente y 19 Avenida Sur, Residencial Primavera, Santa Tecla, La Libertad, EI Salvador; and Derek C. Smith and Luis Parada Esqs, both of Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, 1101 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 1100, Washington D.C. 20005, USA.\n\n***B: The Dispute***\n--------------------\n\n8.\n\n*The Claims:* As asserted by the Claimant (but denied by the Respondent), the claims pleaded by the Claimant and the Enterprises allege (i) the Respondent\u2019s arbitrary and discriminatory conduct, lack of transparency, unfair and inequitable treatment in failing to act upon the Enterprises\u2019 applications for a mining exploitation concession and environmental permits following the Claimant\u2019s discovery of valuable deposits of gold and silver under exploration licenses granted by MINEC for the Respondent; (ii) the Respondent\u2019s failure to protect the Claimant\u2019s investments in accordance with the provisions of its own law and (iii) the Respondent\u2019s unlawful expropriation of the investments of the Claimant and the Enterprises in El Salvador.\n\n9.\n\nIt will be necessary for the Tribunal to examine more closely the factual allegations made by the Claimant later in this decision. For present purposes, the factual and legal bases for the Claimant\u2019s claim may be summarized as follows:\n\n10.\n\nAs alleged, the Claimant advances claims arising out of unlawful and politically motivated measures taken against the Claimant\u2019s investments by the Government of the Respondent, acting by its President (President Saca), the Ministries, MARN and MINEC.\n\n11.\n\nIt is alleged that in 2002 the Respondent induced and encouraged Pacific Rim, the Claimant and the Enterprises to spend tens of millions of US dollars to undertake mineral exploration activities in El Salvador acting with licenses duly granted by the Respondent\u2019s Government, in accordance with Salvadoran law and with the approval of Salvadoran officials; and that the Enterprises proceeded to explore for and find gold and silver and then to prepare for their extraction. It is alleged that under Salvadoran law and according to the Government\u2019s direct and explicit representations, the Enterprises were entitled to proceed to extract such minerals upon the successful completion of the exploration phase. The Claimant and the Enterprises had devoted enormous resources to approved exploration activities and in pursuing the proper regulatory procedures in order to pursue the subsequent extraction phase.\n\n12.\n\nIt is alleged that the investments made by the Claimant and the Enterprises included (*inter alia*) building infrastructure, community development initiatives, mineral exploration and mine development conducted in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.\n\n13.\n\nHowever, in March 2008, it is alleged that President Saca abruptly and without any justification announced that, as President, he opposed granting any new mining permits to the Enterprises. This announcement followed an extended period during which the Respondent had ceased to communicate with the Enterprises. Without governmental action, the Enterprises could not exercise what they considered as their vested rights, which had been earned through the costly and time-consuming mineral exploration phase, to proceed to the extraction and exploitation phase.\n\n14.\n\nIt is alleged that, although the Enterprises pressed for an explanation of why they had been effectively shut off from communication with the Government, only after President Saca\u2019s announcement did the Enterprises understand that they had become the target of something other than mere bureaucratic delay or incompetence. Rather, President Saca, without any legal or other valid reason, had simply decided to shut down the Enterprises and deprive them and the Claimant of their substantial and longterm investments in El Salvador.\n\n15.\n\nAs a result of the Government\u2019s actions and inactions, it is alleged that the rights held by the Enterprises were rendered virtually worthless and the Claimant\u2019s investments in El Salvador were effectively destroyed, causing losses to the Claimant and the Enterprises measured in hundreds of millions of US dollars.\n\n16.\n\nIn light of the Government\u2019s actions and inactions, it is alleged by the Claimant that the Respondent breached its obligations under Section A of CAFTA, namely:\n\n(i) CAFTA Article 10.3: \"National Treatment\";  \n(ii) CAFTA Article 10.4: \"Most-Favored Nation Treatment\";  \n(iii) CAFTA Article 10.5: \"Minimum Standard of Treatment\";  \n(iv) CAFTA Article 10.7: \"Expropriation and Compensation\"; and  \n(v) CAFTA Article 10.l6.1(b)(i)(B): as to \"investment authorizations.\"\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant also alleges that the Respondent has breached the Salvadoran Investment Law, which prohibits expropriation without compensation, as well as unjustified or discriminatory measures which may hinder the establishment, administration, use, usufruct, extension, sale and liquidation of foreign investments (Articles 5 - Equal Protection, 6 - Non-discrimination and 8 - Expropriation).\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimant also alleges that the Respondent has breached the Salvadoran Mining Law (Articles 8, 14, 19 and 23), Article 86 of the Salvadoran Constitution, Article 1 of the Salvadoran Civil Code and Article 4(j) of the Salvadoran Governmental Ethics Law.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that, as a result of the Respondent\u2019s unlawful actions and inactions, the Claimant and the Enterprises have incurred damages measured in hundreds of millions of US dollars, including investment expenses in excess of US$ 77 million, together with interest.\n\n20.\n\n*The Answers* : The Respondent denies all the Claimant\u2019s allegations in the strongest terms. The Respondent also does not accept the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to decide these claims on their merits. More immediately, the Respondent submits that almost all these claims are \"inadmissible\u2019 under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5, which submission is the subject-matter of this decision.\n\n***C: The Arbitration Agreement***\n----------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe arbitration agreement between the Parties, as invoked in paragraph 19 of the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration, results, on the one hand, from the consents expressed by the Respondent in Article 10.17 of CAFTA and Article 15(a) of the Investment Law and, on the other hand, from the consent expressed thereto by the Claimant in its Request for Arbitration.\n\n22.\n\nArticle 10.17 of CAFTA provides (in the English version), in relevant part:\n\n*\"1. Each Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Section [i.e. Section B: \"Investor-State Dispute Settlement\"] in accordance with this Agreement.*\n\n*2. The consent under paragraph 1 and the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Section shall satisfy the requirements of: (a)* *Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre)... for written consent of the parties to the dispute...\"*\n\n23.\n\nArticle 15(a) of the Investment Law provides (as translated by the Claimant from the original Spanish into English), in relevant part:\n\n*\"In the case of disputes arising among foreign investors and the State, regarding their investments in El Salvador, the investors may submit the controversy to: (a) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), in order to settle the dispute by... arbitration, in* *accordance with the Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes* *Between States and Investors of Other States (ICSID Convention)...\"1*\n\nThe original Spanish text of Article 15 of the Investment Law provides: \"En caso que surgieren controversias \u00f3 diferencias entre los inversionistas nacionales o extranjeros y el Estado, referentes a inversiones de aquellos, efectuadas en El Salvador, las partes podr\u00e1n acudir a los tribunales de justicia competentes, de acuerdo a los procedimientos legales. En el caso de controversias surgidas entre inversionistas extranjeros y el Estado, referentes a inversiones de aquellos efectuadas en EI Salvador, los inversionistas podr\u00e1n remitir la controversia: (a) Al Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones (CIADI), con el objeto de resolver la controversia mediante conciliaci\u00f3n y arbitraje, de conformidad con el Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de otros Estados (Convenio del CIADI);..\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant submits that each of its claims, disputed by the Respondent, give rise, as regards the ICSID Convention, to a legal dispute between the Respondent as a Contracting State and the Claimant as a national of another Contracting State, arising directly out of an investment, which the Claimant and the Respondent have consented in writing to submit to the Centre (ICSID), within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant also submits, as regards the Investment Law, that its disputed claims likewise give rise to a dispute between the Claimant as a foreign investor and the Respondent as the State relating to an investment made by the Claimant in El Salvador, within the meaning of the Investment Law, which the Claimant and the Respondent have consented in writing to submit to the Centre (ICSID), within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.\n\n26.\n\nPursuant to CAFTA Article 10.18.4, the Claimant affirmed in its Notice of Arbitration that neither the Claimant nor the Enterprises had previously submitted any of the breaches alleged in the Notice of Arbitration to any other binding dispute resolution procedure for adjudication or resolution (paragraph 23); and, further, the Claimant pleaded in its Notice of Arbitration, pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.18.2(b)(ii), that the Claimant and the Enterprises waived their rights to initiate or continue any domestic proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach in the Notice of Arbitration (paragraph 24).\n\n27.\n\nA copy of such waiver, the original of which was delivered to the Respondent with the Notice of Arbitration, was attached as Exhibit 1 to the Notice of Arbitration. It was later amended, as described below.\n\n28.\n\nIn addition to such waiver, the Claimant and the Enterprises sought to reserve the right in the Notice of Arbitration, pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.18.3, to initiate or continue any proceedings for injunctive relief not involving the payment of damages before any administrative or judicial tribunal of the Respondent for the purposes of preserving their rights and interests during this arbitration (paragraph 25).\n\n***D: The Arbitral Tribunal***\n------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimant, pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.16(6) and the ICSID Convention, appointed as arbitrator by its Notice of Arbitration in these arbitration proceedings: Professor Dr Guido Santiago Tawil of M&M Bomchil, Suipacha 268, 12th Floor, C1008AAF, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent, pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.19 and the ICSID Convention appointed by letter dated 14 July 2009: Professor Brigitte Stern, 7 rue Pierre Nicole, Paris, 75005, France.\n\n31.\n\nThe Parties, pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.19 and ICSID Convention Article 37(2)(a), agreed to appoint as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal, on 13 November 2009: V.V.Veeder Esq of Essex Court Chambers, 24 Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields, London WC2A 3EG, United Kingdom.\n\n***E: The Arbitral Procedure***\n-------------------------------\n\n32.\n\n*Written Pleadings:* The Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration on 30 April 2009 pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, CAFTA Article 10.16 and Article 15(a) of the Respondent\u2019s Investment Law, following the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Intent to submit a claim made to the Respondent pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.16(2) on 9 December 2008, such claim said to relate to events taking place more than one year previously (for ease of reference, here called the \"Notice of Arbitration\" and the \"Notice of Intent\" respectively).\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration is not a short document. It comprises 131 numbered paragraphs over 54 pages, not including attached exhibits. Moreover by paragraphs 7 and 105, the Notice of Arbitration refers back to the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Intent, also by itself a substantial document. The Notice of Intent was Exhibit 9 to the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n34.\n\nLater in these proceedings, given the terms of these references back to the Notice of Intent, it was not entirely clear whether the Notice of Arbitration formally incorporated the Notice of Intent. It would not ordinarily matter, save that the Notice of Intent expressly alleges arbitrary, unjustified and discriminatory conduct by the Respondent whereas the Notice of Arbitration does not make the same allegations, save for the reference to and summary of the Notice of Intent in paragraph 105 of the Notice of Arbitration. On the second day of the Oral Hearing (see below), whilst contending primarily that the Notice of Arbitration sufficiently pleaded its Claims, the Claimant requested, in the alternative, an amendment to its Notice of Arbitration by specifically incorporating the relevant words from its Notice of Intent into paragraph 105 of its Notice of Arbitration [D2,4132].\n\nReferences to the *verbatim* transcript of the Oral Hearing are here made thus: \"D2,413\" signifies the second day of the Oral Hearing, at page 413 of the transcript.\n\n35.\n\nThere was no question of the Respondent being thereby caught unfairly by surprise, having received both the Notice of Intent and the Notice of Arbitration; nor is the Respondent otherwise prejudiced by the Claimant\u2019s proposed amendment. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is indeed arguable that the Notice of Arbitration is sufficiently pleaded by incorporating the Notice of Intent. For present purposes, however, to curtail this somewhat technical debate, the Tribunal is here content to treat the Notice of Arbitration as amended in the manner requested by the Claimant.\n\n36.\n\nThe Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration as a request for arbitration under Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention on 15 June 2009.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Preliminary Objections under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 on 4 January 2010 (for ease of reference, here called the \"Preliminary Objections\").\n\n38.\n\nA preliminary meeting with the Tribunal and the Parties was held by telephone conference-call on 12 January 2010 to establish (*inter alia*) the time-table for addressing the Preliminary Objections on an expedited basis, the proceedings on the merits being suspended pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.20.4(b) and 10.20.5.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant submitted its Response to the Preliminary Objections on 26 February 2010 (for ease of reference, here called the \"Response\"), in accordance with the procedural time-table established following the preliminary meeting as amended by order of the Tribunal.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Reply to the Response on 31 March 2010 (for ease of reference, here called the \"Reply\"). It contained, *inter alia*, the expert legal opinion of Professor W. Michael Reisman on \"The International Legal Interpretation of the Waiver Provision in CAFTA Chapter 10.\"\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant submitted its Rejoinder to the Reply on 13 May 2010 (for ease of Reference, here called the \"Rejoinder\"). It contained, *inter alia*, the expert legal opinion of Professor Don Wallace Jr in response to Professor Reisman\u2019s opinion.\n\n42.\n\n*Procedural Orders* : Upon receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, the Tribunal suspended these arbitration proceedings as to the merits pursuant to CAFTA Articles 10.20.4(b) and 10.20.5 and established the schedule for considering these objections (described above) until further order or award.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal has made several other procedural orders in these proceedings leading up to the Oral Hearing, principally its orders issued on 5 March, 21 April, 24 May and 10 June 2010.\n\n44.\n\nAs required by CAFTA Article 10.21(1), the written phase of these arbitration proceedings has been made publicly available on the Respondent\u2019s web-site3.\n\nSee the Respondent\u2019s web-site: http://www.minec.gob.sv/index.php?option=com\\_phocadownload&view=category&id=30:commerce-group-vrs-republica-de-el-salvador&Itemid=63\n\n45.\n\n*The Oral Hearing* : As requested by the Parties pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.20.5, the oral hearing took place at the World Bank, Washington DC, USA over two days on 31 May and 1 June 2010. It was recorded by English and Spanish stenographers; and as required by CAFTA Article 10.21(2), the hearing was made publicly available, contemporaneously by live-stream, in both English and Spanish languages, on ICSID\u2019s web-site. It remains available on ICSID\u2019s web-site.4\n\nSee ICSID\u2019s web-site: http://icsid.worldbank.org.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent was represented by Mr. Benjam\u00edn Pleit\u00e9s (Secretary General of the Attorney General\u2019s Office), Mr. Daniel R\u00edos (Legal Adviser from the Ministry of the Economy), Ms. Arely Elizabeth Mej\u00eda and Ms. Celia Beatriz Lizama (both from the Ministry of the Economy), Mr. Enilson Solano (from the Respondent\u2019s Embassy in Washington DC) and from Messrs. Dewey & LeBoeuf: Mr. Derek Smith, Mr. Aldo Baldini, Mr. Luis Parada, Mr. Tom\u00e1s Sol\u00eds, Ms. Erin Argueta, Ms. Paula Corredor, Ms. Mary Lewis, and Mr. Eric Stanculescu. The Claimant was represented by Mr. Tom Shrake (President and CEO of Pacific Rim); and from Messrs. Crowel & Moring LLP: Mr. Arif H. Ali, Mr. Alexandre de Gramont, Mr. R. Timothy McCrum, Mr. Theodore Posner, Ms. Ashley R. Riveira, and Ms. Erica Franzetti.\n\n47.\n\nThe USA, as a Non-Disputing Party, attended the Oral Hearing, being represented by Mr. Mark Feldman, Ms. Jennifer Thornton, Mr. Neale Bergman, and Ms. Kimberley Claman (all from the US Department of State).\n\n48.\n\nAt the end of the Oral Hearing, the Parties confirmed that (i) the deadline for issuing this decision should be extended to 2 August 2010, as an \"extraordinary cause\" pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.20.5 [D2. 459 & 461] and (ii) that the decision could be first issued in the English version, with the Spanish version to follow at a later date [D2. 472].\n\n49.\n\n*Post-Hearing* : The Tribunal made arrangements for the submission of written comments by CAFTA Contracting States (other than the Respondent) pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.20.2; and it also made separate arrangements for third persons to apply to the Tribunal for permission to make written submissions as *amici curiae* pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.20.3 and ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).\n\n50.\n\nAs regards *amici curiae*, the Tribunal made and publicised the following procedural order on 10 June 2010:\n\n*\"In accordance with Article 10.20.3 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA-US) and ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), the Tribunal invites any person or entity that is not a Disputing Party in these arbitration proceedings or a Contracting Party to DR-CAFTA-US to make a written application to the Tribunal for permission to file submissions as an amicus curiae.*\n\n*All such written applications should:*\n\n*(1) be emailed to ICSID at icsidsecretariat@worldbank.org by Wednesday, 16 June 2010;*\n\n*(2) in no case exceed 20 pages in all (including the appendix described below);*\n\n*(3) be made in one of the languages of these proceedings, i.e. English or Spanish;*\n\n*(4) be dated and signed by the person or by an authorized signatory for the entity making the application verifying its contents, with address and other contact details;*\n\n*(5) describe the identity and background of the applicant, the nature of any membership if it is an organization and the nature of any relationships to the Disputing Parties and any Contracting Party;*\n\n*(6) disclose whether the applicant has received, directly or indirectly, any financial or other material support from any Disputing Party,* *Contracting Party or from any person connected with the subject-matter of these arbitration proceedings;*\n\n*(7) specify the nature of the applicant\u2018s interest in these arbitration proceedings prompting its application;*\n\n*(8) include (as an appendix to the application) a copy of the applicant\u2018s written submissions to be filed in these arbitration proceedings, assuming permission is granted by the Tribunal for such filing, such submissions to address only matters within the scope of the subject-matter of these arbitration proceedings;

It appears to have engendered substantial controversy and widespread disquiet, not limited to the Claimant and the Respondent. By this decision, the Tribunal addresses only the limited procedural issues raised by the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5. As will appear below, the Tribunal does not otherwise address any other procedural issues or any of the merits, particularly whether or not any of the Claimant\u2019 s pleaded claims are well-founded in law or fact. Apart from the Tribunal\u2019s decision on these limited issues under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5, it should not be assumed that the Tribunal has made any decision on the merits of any of the Claimant\u2019s claims or on any of the Respondent\u2019s several responses (pleaded or unpleaded), both as to the merits or otherwise.\n\n57.\n\nIn making this decision, the Tribunal has considered all the written and oral submissions of the Parties. In order to explain the grounds for the Tribunal\u2019s decision, it is necessary below to cite or summarise a certain number of these submissions at some length, but not all of them. The fact that a submission is not cited or summarised below does not signify that it was not considered by the Tribunal.\n\n58.\n\n***The Respondent's Preliminary Objections:*** As already indicated in Part I above, the Respondent filed Preliminary Objections pursuant to CAFTA\u2019s expedited procedure in CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 to request the dismissal by the Tribunal of the Claimant\u2019s claims relating to the application for a mining exploitation concession in El Dorado, as well as the dismissal of the Claimant\u2019s other CAFTA claims and the dismissal of all the Claimant\u2019s non-CAFTA claims in these ICSID arbitration proceedings, together with an order for costs against the Claimant.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant disputes each of the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections and requests a decision from the Tribunal dismissing them all, together with an order for costs against the Respondent.\n\n60.\n\nIt is convenient here to summarise briefly each of the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, before returning to them more fully later below *seriatim*, together with the Claimant\u2019s responses. (This summary reflects the submissions advanced by the respondent and does not reflect the views of the Tribunal).\n\n61.\n\n*The El Dorado Claim* : The Claimant\u2019s principal claim relates to El Dorado. As regards this claim, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to discharge its burden with regard to PRES\u2019 alleged entitlement to such a concession on two specific grounds. First, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s suggestion, there is no automatic right to a concession under Salvadoran law. Second, instead of pleading the required factual bases in its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant merely asserts a legal conclusion that PRES has purportedly \"perfected\" a legal right to an exploitation concession, subject only to the Government\u2019s failure to approve an Environmental Impact Study and issue an Environmental Permit. The Respondent contends that the Claimant has therefore failed to plead essential facts to demonstrate that PRES complied with, as the Claimant admits, the \"plain and explicit\" requirements under Salvadoran law which must be satisfied before a company may seek, still less obtain, a mining exploitation concession from the Respondent.\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s failure to plead the necessary facts, so the Respondent contends, follows from PRES\u2019 failure to comply with those legal requirements, as demonstrated by the \"undisputed facts\" evident from the Claimant\u2019s own documents. Thus, even if the Respondent\u2019s Government were to approve the Environmental Impact Study and grant the necessary Environmental Permit, the \"undisputed facts\" show that PRES would still not have any legal right to obtain the exploitation concession. In short, even assuming as true all of the Claimant\u2019s factual allegations regarding the Environmental Permit, the alleged actions or inactions of the Respondent\u2019s Government can have caused the Claimant no legal harm.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the El Dorado claim, as pleaded by the Claimant, must therefore fail. The Respondent concludes that all claims by the Claimant relating to El Dorado are not claims \"for which an award in favour of the Claimant may be made\" within the meaning of CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.26.\n\n64.\n\n*Other CAFTA Claims* : As regards the Claimant\u2019s other CAFTA claims relating to the exploration licenses granted to the two Enterprises, the Respondent seeks the dismissal of all claims related to the Santa Rita exploration licence. The Claimant has similarly failed to plead the factual or legal basis to bring any claim related to the Santa Rita exploration licence; and, in any event, the Claimant has already lost any rights it may have had to renew the Santa Rita exploration licence when PRES failed to seek the renewal of the exploration license on the requisite timely basis. The Respondent also seeks the dismissal of other secondary CAFTA claims for which the Claimant has not provided a factual basis, pursuant to CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.26.\n\n65.\n\n*Non-CAFTA Claims:* The Respondent likewise seeks the dismissal of all non-CAFTA claims advanced by the Claimant on the ground that the Claimant has violated CAFTA\u2019s exclusivity clause and its own express waiver by introducing claims under the Investment Law that are based on the same measures which the Claimant alleges are breaches of CAFTA, pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.20.5.\n\n66.\n\n*Reservation:* As already noted above, the filing of preliminary objections under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 was not intended by the Respondent to signify that the Respondent accepted the jurisdiction of ICSID or the competence of the Tribunal to decide the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute. The Respondent recorded in its Preliminary Objections (paragraph 7) that if the Claimant were to continue with these arbitration proceedings beyond the stage of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, the Respondent reserved the right to object to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal regarding any remaining claims, pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.20.4(d), the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n***PART III: THE RELEVANT LEGAL TEXTS***\n----------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\n***Introduction*** : It is convenient to set out here, in full, the relevant provisions of CAFTA Section B: Investor-State Dispute Settlement, to which subsequent reference is made later in this decision; namely CAFTA Articles 10.16, 10.18, 10.20.4, 10.20.5 and 10.22.\n\n68.\n\nCAFTA Article 10.16: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\n\n*1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:*\n\n*(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this section a claim*\n\n*(i) that the respondent has breached*\n\n*(A) an obligation under Section A [of Chapter Ten]*\n\n*(B) an investment authorization, or*\n\n*(C) an investment agreement*\n\n*and*\n\n*(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; and*\n\n*(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim*\n\n*(i) that the respondent has breached*\n\n*(A) an obligation under Section A,*\n\n*(B) an investment authorization, or*\n\n*(C) an investment agreement;*\n\n*and*\n\n*(iii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.*\n\n*2. At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this Section, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration (\"notice of intent\"). The notice shall specify:*\n\n*(a) the name and address of the claimant and, where a claim is submitted on behalf of an enterprise, the name, address, and place of incorporation of the enterprise;*\n\n*(b) for each claim, the provision of this Agreement, investment authorization, or investment agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions;*\n\n*(c) the legal and factual basis for each claim; and*\n\n*(d) the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed.*\n\n*3. Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim, a claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph 1:*\n\n*(a) under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedures for Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the respondent and the Party of the claimant are parties to the ICSID Convention;*\n\n*(b) under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either the respondent or the Party of the claimant is a party to the ICSID Convention; or*\n\n*(c) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.*\n\n*4. A claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section when the claimant\u2018s notice of or request for arbitration (\"notice of arbitration\"):*\n\n*(a) referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 36 of the ICSID Convention is received by the Secretary-General;*\n\n*(b) referred to in Article 2 of Schedule C of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules is received by the Secretary-General; or*\n\n*(c) referred to in Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, together with the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, are received by the* *respondent.*\n\n*A claim asserted for the first time after such notice of arbitration is submitted shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section on the date of its receipt under the applicable arbitral rules.*\n\n*5. The arbitration rules applicable under paragraph 3, and in effect on the date the claim or claims were submitted to arbitration under this Section, shall govern the arbitration except to the extent modified by this Agreement.*\n\n69.\n\nCAFTA Article 10.18: Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party\n\n*1. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims* *brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage.*\n\n*2. No claim may be submitted under this Section unless:*\n\n*(a) the claimant consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and*\n\n*(b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,*\n\n*(i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant\u2018s written waiver, and*\n\n*(ii) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), by the claimant\u2018s and the enterprise\u2018s written waivers* *of any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.*\n\n*3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2(b), the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) and the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim injunctive relief and does not involve the payment of monetary damages before a judicial or administrative tribunal of the respondent, provided that the action is brought for the sole purpose of preserving the claimant\u2018s or the enterprise\u2018s rights and interests during the pendency of the arbitration.*\n\n*4. No claim may be submitted to arbitration:*\n\n*(a) for breach of an investment authorization under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(B) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B), or*\n\n*(b) for breach of an investment agreement under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C).*\n\n*if the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.61.1(b)) has previously submitted the same alleged breach to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure, for adjudication or resolution.*\n\n70.\n\nCAFTA Articles 10.20.4 & 10.20.5: Conduct of the Arbitration\n\n*4. Without prejudice to a tribunal\u2018s authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.*\n\n*(a) Such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial (or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment).*\n\n*(b) On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor.*\n\n*(c) In deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant\u2018s factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.*\n\n*(d) The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 5.*\n\n*5. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal\u2018s competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.*\n\n*6. When it decides a respondent\u2018s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney\u2018s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant\u2018s claim or the respondent\u2018s objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.*\n\n71.\n\nCAFTA Article 10.22: Governing Law\n\n*1. Subject to paragraph 3, when a claim is submitted under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(A), the tribunal shall decide the* *issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.*\n\n*2. Subject to paragraph 3 and the other terms of this Section, when a claim is submitted under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(B) or (C), or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(b) or (C), the tribunal shall apply:*\n\n*(a) the rules of law specified in the pertinent investment agreement or investment authorization, or as the disputing parties may otherwise agree; or*\n\n*(b) if the rules of law have not been specified or otherwise agreed:*\n\n*(i) the law of the respondent, including its rules on the conflict of laws; and*\n\n*(ii) such rules of international law as may be applicable.*\n\n*3. A decision of the Commission declaring its interpretation of a provision of this Agreement under Article 19.1.3(c) (The Free Trade Commission) shall be binding on a tribunal established under this Section, and any decision or award issued by the tribunal must be consistent with that decision.*\n\n***PART IV: THE RELEVANT FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n***A: Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n72.\n\nGiven the terms and effect of CAFTA Article 10.20.4(c), cited in Part III above, it is necessary for present purposes to bear carefully in mind the factual allegations made by the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration.\n\n73.\n\nThese are, at this stage, only allegations pleaded by the Claimant; each material allegation is denied or expressly not admitted by the Respondent; and the Tribunal cannot here address, under CAFTA Article 10.20.4(c), whether or not any of these disputed allegations are or could be established or negated by actual evidence.\n\n74.\n\nMoreover, given the significance of the Claimant\u2019s pleading allegedly supporting its factual case, it is necessary here to cite at length part of the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration (with its own footnotes). For obvious reasons, it would here be wholly inappropriate for the Tribunal to seek to summarise these factual allegations in its own words.\n\n***B: The Claimant's Notice of Arbitration***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe following numbered paragraphs 26 to 81 are taken *verbatim* from the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration, ostensibly as the Claimant\u2019s pleaded \"Factual Bases for the Claim\" relevant to CAFTA Article 10.20.4:\n\n*26. \"The Claimant\u2018s and Enterprises \u2018 claims arise out of El Salvador\u2018s arbitrary and discriminatory conduct, lack of transparency, and unfair and inequitable treatment in failing to act upon the Enterprises\u2018 applications for a mining exploitation concession and for various environmental permits following PRC\u2018s discovery of valuable deposits of gold and silver under exploration licenses granted by MINEC, as well as EI Salvador\u2018s failure to protect Claimant\u2018s investments in accordance with the provisions of its own law, and its expropriation of Claimant\u2018s and the Enterprises\u2018 investments. The relevant factual background underlying these claims is summarized below.*\n\n*A. Overview of the Legal Framework for Mining in El Salvador*\n\n*27. In 1996, El Salvador enacted a new and modern Ley de Miner\u00eda* *(\"Mining Law).*5*It replaced an antiquated mining law that had been in place since 1922. The new law was born of the Government\u2018s stated desire to attract increased investment in - and increased exploration and extraction of - the country\u2018s natural minerals. The Preamble of the 1996 Mining Law explicitly states that the law was enacted as a result of the obsolescence of the Mining Code of 1922, and the need to adopt new legal rules for modern times. Thus, according to its Preamble, the 1996 Mining Law was designed to \"promote the exploration and exploitation of mining resources by means of the application of modern techniques allowing an integral use of the minerals,\"6 Moreover, the same Preamble acknowledged the paramount importance of modern legislation, which would be desirable to mining investors and promote the social and economic development of the areas where the minerals might be located.*7\n\n*28. Pursuant to the Mining Law \u2018s corresponding regulations (\"Mining Law Regulations\"),*8*MINEC is the authority charged with regulating all mining activity within EI Salvador. All mining companies, whether local or foreign, must apply to MINEC in order to receive a license to explore for precious metals in a specific area, and subsequently for an exploitation concession once precious metal deposits are confirmed.*\n\n*1. MINEC Licensing Requirements*\n\n*29. Article 9 of the Mining Law provides that only those applicants that demonstrate the technical and financial ability to develop mining projects can obtain mining rights.*\n\n*30. Exploration licenses are granted by resolution issued by MINEC\u2018s* *Direcci\u00f3n de Hidrocarburos, y Minas (\"Department ofMines\").9 The applicant seeking an exploration license must file an application with the Department of Mines, enclosing certain requirements, which include a technical exploration program, evidence of the applicant\u2018s technical and financial ability, and experience in mining activities.*10*Once an application is filed, the Department of Mines performs a physical inspection of the proposed exploration area.*11*Upon completing this inspection and evaluating the application, the Department of Mines must issue a resolution that either grants or denies the exploration license.*12\n\n*31. If an exploration license is granted, the Mining Law imposes a number of obligations on the licensee. Specifically, Article 22 of the Mining Law sets out the obligations of an exploration licensee to demonstrate the extent of its investment activities to MINEC in detail. For example, licensees are required to: (a) comply with a technical program for exploration activities approved by the Department of Mines;*13*(b) demonstrate on an annual basis to the Department of Mines the activities and investments that were undertaken by the licensee pursuant to the technical program; (c) file annual reports describing, inter alia, the nature of the minerals being explored, the nature and extent of the licensees\u2018 exploration efforts, the results of those efforts, the corresponding expenses incurred, and plans for future explorations;*14*and (d) pay the annual license fee. In short, licensees must undertake and maintain substantial exploration activities, in compliance with the requirements of the Mining Law, in order to preserve their right to continue to explore. A licensee cannot simply \"sit on its rights \" to develop a claim merely by paying a license fee.*\n\n*32. While the Mining Law imposes detailed obligations on exploration licensees, it also extends to them significant rights and assurances. In particular, the Mining Law establishes a two-phase framework applicable to mining extraction activities. Article 23 of the Mining Law provides in relevant part:* *Once the exploration is concluded and the existence of economic mining potential on the authorized area is proved, the granting of the Concession for the exploitation and utilization of minerals shall be requested; which Concession will be verified through an Accord with the Ministry, followed by the granting of a Contract between the Ministry and the Holder, for a thirty (30) year term, which may be extended if the interested party requests it, if in the judgment of the Department [of Mines] and the Ministry, the requisites established by this Law are fulfilled.*15\n\n*33. As already set out above, during the mineral exploration phase, licensees are required to make substantial investments while also assuming significant risk. In accordance with the regime established by the Mining Law, the exploration phase may last up to eight years,*16*during which time the mining company expends significant capital in its attempt to locate and develop mineable deposits of minerals.*\n\n*34. Therefore, under the two-phase framework, a licensee who completes the exploration phase is entitled to proceed to the mineral extraction or \"exploitation \" phase - without which all of the investment and effort devoted to the exploration phase would be wasted. Once the exploration phase is concluded and the licensee has determined that there is \"economical mining potential\" at a site, the licensee has the right to request an exploitation concession for the purpose of mineral extraction in order to protect its exclusive rights over the license area.*17*Moreover, the Government is required to grant the licensee an exploitation concession once the exploration phase is concluded, the existence of mineable deposits has been demonstrated, and the licensee has both filed* *the application provided in Article 36 of the Mining Law and enclosed the documents described below.*18\n\n*35. For purposes of submitting an application to receive an exploitation concession, the pertinent documents provided by the law to be attached to a concession application are set out in Article 37 of the Mining Law. These documents include presentation of:*\n\n\u25ca *A description of the area for which the concession is requested;*\n\n\u25ca *A showing that the licensee owns or is authorized to use the real estate property where the mine project is located;*\n\n\u25ca *The relevant Permiso Ambiental19 (\"Permit \") issued by MARN* *and accompanied by a copy of the corresponding Estudio de Impacto Ambiental20 (\"PIA \");*\n\n\u25ca *An Estudio de Factibilidad T\u00e9cnico Econ\u00f3mico (\"Feasibility Study\"); and*\n\n\u25ca *A five-year Program a de Explotaci\u00f3n (\"Development Plan \").*\n\n*36. In addition to the requirements of the Mining Law, Article 18 of the Mining Law Regulation requires that the applicant for the exploitation concession submit a summary of the proposed work and investment to be made during the initial exploitation phase.*\n\n*37. In accordance with Article 38 of the Mining Law, as well as* *applicable principles of Salvadoran administrative law, if a qualified* *licensee fails to comply with any of these requirements for presentation of* *a concession application, MINEC must grant the licensee a reasonable* *period to cure. However, the licensee does not lose its right to obtain the* *exploitation concession because of such a failure; that right is perfected* *upon the discovery and demonstration of the existence of mineable ore* *deposits in the license area in accordance with Article 23. Indeed, the* *Mining Law makes it clear that the right to develop a mine constitutes a* *property right, subject to all the protections of the Salvadoran Constitution and other applicable laws.*21\n\n*38. Under the legal framework established by the Mining Law, the mining company assumes the great risks inherent in the exploration phase. However, it undertakes those risks with the expectation that, if it is able to prove that a discovery of a valuable mineral deposit has been made and otherwise complies with the requirements of the Mining Law, it will be able to obtain an exploitation concession. Without that expectation, no one would undertake exploration. Only during the exploitation phase can a mining company extract metal from the land and begin to generate a return on the substantial upfront investment it has made during the exploration phase. Receiving an exploitation concession after demonstrating that the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit has been made and otherwise complying with the requirements of the Mining Law represents the benefit to be derived from the large expense incurred by a mining licensee during the exploration phase. In short, the promise of an exploitation concession is the reason why companies undertake their investments in the first place.*\n\n*39. To be sure, the mining company undertakes the risk that the mine will not be viable for valid technical or engineering reasons. But the mining company does not undertake the risk that the Government will arbitrarily or capriciously either deny the company its right to proceed to the exploitation phase, or, as in this case, destroy its investment simply by failing to act once the company has successfully completed the exploration phase and complied with all of the legal requirements to obtain an exploitation concession.*\n\n*2. MARN\u2018s Environmental Permit Process*\n\n*40. As indicated above, Article 37 of the Mining Law requires that the applicant for an exploitation concession attach an environmental permit* *to its application. In addition, pursuant to Articles 19 and 82 of the Ley* *del Medio Ambiente (\"Environmental Law \"),22 an entity seeking to engage in mining exploration or exploitation must apply to MARN for an environmental permit before undertaking those activities.*\n\n*41. The administrative procedure to obtain an environmental permit is detailed in Article 19 of the Regulations to the Environmental Law (the \"EnvironmentalLaw Regulations\").23 In order to obtain the required* *environmental permit, the company must initially file an environmental form containing the preliminary information requested by MARN.*24*Once it has received the form, MARN issues the terms of reference for the* *preparation of a \"multidisciplinary \" EIA.25 The EIA then filed by the applicant is subject, first, to a technical review by MARN, second, to public comment,*26*and, third, to a report on the public comments to be issued by MARN. MARN is only authorized to provide a single set of observations on the EIA during the process. Once the applicant has* *responded to these observations, MARN is authorized to provide further comments only in relation to new facts or information that the applicant may have provided in its responses.*27*In turn, if the applicant cannot adequately respond to these further comments, the permit may be denied.*28*If the applicant does respond adequately, the permit will be granted.*29*In any case, the permit must be either granted or denied within sixty (60) working days of submission of the original EIA.*30\n\n*42. As discussed below, the Enterprises complied strictly with all of the requirements imposed on them under the Mining Law and its regulations, the Environmental Law and its Regulations, and all other applicable law to obtain the requisite exploration and exploitation environmental permits.*\n\n*B. Pacific Rim Invests in El Salvador*\n\n*43. In consideration of and reliance on the legal framework set forth above, in April 2002, Pacific Rim set its sights on investing in El Salvador by merging with Dayton Mining Corporation (\"Dayton \"), a Canadian mining company that had been operating in El Salvador on its own or through affiliated companies since 1993. In particular, Dayton had two exploration licenses: one for El Dorado Norte, and one for El Dorado Sur.*31\n\n*44. Because of El Salvador \u2018s unique geological features, it was and is an ideal location for an environmentally responsible mining company such as Pacific Rim. In particular, El Salvador is a country dominated by \"low sulfidation \" geological systems, which allow for non-acidgenerating precious metals recovery, and therefore for mining with minimal environmental impacts. In addition, the high-grade, vein-type precious metal deposits found in EI Salvador, and specifically in the area of Las Caba\u00f1as, are suitable for underground mine development, which has a significantly reduced impact on the environment and community surrounding the mine site as compared to \u2014open-pit\" mines.*\n\n*45. In connection with its due diligence for the Dayton merger, Pacific Rim of course studied and relied upon the new Mining Law and Mining Regulations that had been enacted in 1996, as well as the 2001 amendments. While those amendments - which extended the number of years for which exploration licenses could be granted - were under review, on June 28, 2001, the Government issued Decree No. 456.*32*This decree extended the validity of all exploration licenses due to expire in 2001 until the end of the year, in order to allow the Legislative Assembly sufficient time to promulgate the amendments to the Mining Law that were necessary to allow for further extensions of the relevant licenses.* *Significantly, the Preamble to Decree No. 456 stated that the reasons for the \u2014emergency\" extension of the exploration licenses included the \u2014great importance [of mining activity] to the economy of the country; as it generates investments by national and foreign companies, contributing in this way to the creation of jobs and development in the areas where these activities are made.*33*Moreover, the decree acknowledged that the expiration of the exploration licenses would cause \u2014great prejudice\" to the investors in light of the investments that they had made in pursuit of their exploration activities.*34\n\n*46. In addition to relying on the country\u2018s specific promotion of the mining sector, Pacific Rim was impressed by the pro-foreign investment legal framework that recently had been introduced and that was actively being promoted by EI Salvador during the same time frame. In 1999, for example, the Government had adopted a new Investment Law, which, inter alia, granted equal conditions for national and foreign companies,35 and prohibited the Government from expropriating foreigners\u2018 property without compensation.*36*Indeed, the purported aim of this law was to avoid the application of any unjustified or discriminatory measures that could impede the normal activities of foreign investors. Paragraph IV of the Preamble to the Investment Law specifically states:*\n\n*That to increase the level of foreign investment in the country, an appropriate legal framework should be established that contains clear and precise rules in accordance with best practices in this area, enabling the country to compete internationally in the effort to attract new investment....*37\n\n*47. Furthermore, in 2000, the Government founded the Agenda de Promoci\u00f3n de Inversi\u00f3n de El Salvador (\"PROESA \").'38 The specific aim of PROESA is to generate employment, transfer technology, and aid the country\u2018s development process through the attraction of foreign investment to Salvadoran industries. And in that same time period, El Salvador had signed or ratified various bilateral and multilateral* *investment protection and promotion treaties aimed at further assuring the rights of foreign investors in the country. Thus, between 1995 and 2002, El Salvador undertook a number of actions specifically aimed at increasing foreign investment flows and securing the rights offoreign investors.*\n\n*48. In addition to the financial, legal, scientific, technical, and operational due diligence that is customarily completed in merger and acquisition transactions such as the one undertaken by Pacific Rim, the company\u2018s senior management also held due diligence meetings with the Government. In the course of these meetings, Pacific Rim\u2018s representatives received assurances from the Ministers of both MINEC and MARN that the mineral rights in the El Dorado license areas had been legally acquired and properly administered under the relevant laws.* *In particular, high-level officials from MINEC\u2018s Department of Mines gave their assurances that the company\u2018s local operating subsidiary (which, at the time, was called Kinross-ES) would be granted an exploitation concession upon confirming the commercial mining potential of the El Dorado exploration site.*\n\n*49. Assured by its due diligence into the legal, economic, political, and technical aspects of the Salvadoran mining claims, in April 2002, Pacific Rim consummated its merger with Dayton and thereby acquired the assets of Dayton in El Salvador, Chile, and the United States. As a result of the transaction, Pacific Rim became the owner of Kinross-ES,* *Dayton\u2018s wholly owned Salvadoran operating authority, and of Kinross-ES\u2018 mineral exploration rights in various license areas in El Salvador. Of principal importance among these areas (as noted above) were two contiguous license areas known as \u2014El Dorado Norte\" and \u2014El Dorado Sur,\" located in the administrative department of Caba\u00f1as.*\n\n*50. In January 2003, Kinross-ES was renamed \u2014Pacific Rim El Salvador\" (previously defined as \u2014PRES\"). PRES\u2018 mining rights in the El Dorado Sur and El Dorado Norte license areas were acknowledged by the Government of El Salvador in Resolutions No. 181, dated December 5, 2003, and No. 189, dated December 18, 2003. Resolutions 181 and 189 specifically modified all previous exploration licenses issued with respect to the El Dorado Norte and El Dorado Sur areas, recognizing PRES as the owner of all exploration rights in those areas.*\n\n*51. On November 30, 2004, Pacific Rim vested sole ownership rights in* *PRES in its subsidiary, PRC. On August 11, 2005, MINEC\u2018s Oficina* *Nacional de lnversiones (previously defined as \u2014ONI\") acknowledged*  *PRC\u2018s status as the new owner of PRES via Resolution No. 383-R.*39\n\n*52. In June 2005, PRC incorporated a second Salvadoran enterprise,* *DOREX, in order to acquire exploration rights over three additional license areas contiguous to, and partially overlapping with, the El Dorado Norte and El Dorado Sur license areas.*40*As stated above, these three areas are known as \"lluacuco\", \"Pueblos\" and \"(Guaco\"* *(collectively with El Dorado Norte and EI Dorado Sur, the \"El Dorado Project\").*\n\n*53. Since 2002, Pacific Rim, PRC, and the Enterprises have spent many tens of millions of U.S. dollars in El Salvador on infrastructure, community development initiatives, and mineral exploration and development activities related to the El Dorado Project. Their activities in El Salvador have been undertaken in reliance on and with the reasonable investment-backed expectation of being able to engage in income-generating mine development pursuant to a legally authorized exploitation concession. To ensure their entitlement to such a concession, the Enterprises have complied at all times with the provisions of the Mining Law, the Environmental Law, and all other relevant Salvadoran laws. Their continued investment in El Salvador has been based on the (overnment\u2018s express support for the Enterprises\u2018 mining operations in the country.*41*As of this filing, Pacific Rim, PRC, and the Enterprises have invested in excess of US$ 77 million in mining operations and related activities in El Salvador.*\n\n*C. The El Dorado Exploitation Concession*\n\n*54. During 2002 and 2003, PRES*42*carried out significant exploration activities at the El Dorado site under valid exploration licenses. By early 2004, PRES had verified the substantial gold ore deposits at the El Dorado Norte and El Dorado Sur License areas. PRES immediately undertook the necessary steps to secure an exploitation concession from MINEC, and accordingly, in March 2004, filed an application with MARN'for an environmental permit in order to be able to commence exploitation activities on those areas.*\n\n*55. In furtherance of its application for the environmental permit,* *PRES prepared the required EIA for exploitation activities (the \u2014Exploitation EIA\") for submission to MARN. The Exploitation EIA was a thorough and detailed study, fully assessing the baseline environmental conditions and the projected environmental impacts of the mining and reclamation activities using best available operating practices and mitigation measures.*\n\n*56. In a letter dated August 25, 2004, PRES received assurances from the Director of the Department of Mines, Ms. Gina Navas de Hern\u00e1ndez, that the company\u2018s rights to solicit a concession over the El Dorado Norte and El Dorado Sur license areas would not be affected by any potential delay in receiving the environmental permit.*43\n\n*57. In September 2004, PRES filed its Exploitation EIA with MARN. By December 2004, the company had not yet received a response to its EIA. Notwithstanding this lack of information, in order to comply with the requirements of the Mining Law - which mandates that a licensee apply for an exploitation concession upon termination of the exploration phase - and in reliance on MINEC \u2018s earlier representations that delays at MARN would not affect its application, PRES formally submitted its application for a mining exploitation concession to MINEC on December 22, 2004. Pursuant to preliminary discussions between PRES and MINEC, the concession application covered only a portion of the area previously covered by the EI Dorado Norte and EI Dorado Sur exploration licenses. Specifically, MINEC explained that it could not approve a concession covering such a large area. Accordingly, PRES and MINEC worked together to define an acceptable portion of the two license areas over which PRES could solicit an exploitation concession. The areas that were \u2014carved out\" of the original proposed concession areas were the Huacuco, Pueblos, and Guaco areas, where PRES had not* *carried out significant exploration work, and for which DOREX later acquired exploration licenses.*\n\n*58. In the meantime, in February 2005, MARN responded to the EIA that PRES had submitted in September 2004 with a series of observations. These observations were fully addressed by the company via a supplemental volume to the EIA, which PRES submitted to MARN in April 2005.*\n\n*59. After receiving additional input from MARN, PRES submitted a final Exploitation EIA in September 2005, which addressed not only the comments provided by MARN in April, but also responses to further observations PRES received from MARN in August 2005.*\n\n*60. In October 2005, in accordance with the Environmental Law and MARN\u2018s instructions, PRES published information related to the EIA in local newspapers in order to allow the public the opportunity to provide comments on the assessment. At the same time, PRES held public meetings with the local communities to present and explain the EIA.* *Then, in March 2006, MARN provided PRES with the observations to the EIA that had been submitted during this required public comment period.*\n\n*61. In July 2006, MARN supplemented these observations with thirteen additional comments. Although the provision of these additional comments was not contemplated within the permitting process - which was supposed to conclude with the public comment period - PRES nevertheless provided detailed written responses to each of them. Thus, by September 2006, PRES filed a response to the public comments on the EIA, and in October, the company filed a response to MARN\u2018s additional thirteen comments.*\n\n*62. Finally, in December 2006, PRES presented the Ministry with a plan for a state of-the-art water treatment facility that the company proposed to build in order to treat any effluent from the mining and processing operations. This proposal, like the company\u2018s responses to MARN\u2018s additional thirteen comments, was not contemplated within the permitting process, but was rather provided upon the informal request of MARN.*\n\n*63. With the submission of the water treatment facility proposal, PRES had addressed every observation and concern expressed by MARN (whether reasonable, substantiated, or otherwise) throughout the extended EIA review process. Indeed, since December 2006, MARN has not once expressed any concerns as to the adequacy of the company\u2018s EIA. It has likewise never expressed any doubt as to PRES\u2018s full compliance with all of the requirements of the permitting process. As* *such, in accordance with Salvadoran law, PRES is entitled to receive an environmental permit for mining on the EI Dorado site.*\n\n*64. From December 2006 through December 2008, however, MARN ceased all official communication with the company in regards to its application, notwithstanding the fact that Salvadoran law clearly stipulates that MARN must take definitive action on EIA submissions within 60 business days, and even under exceptional circumstances, within a maximum of 120 business days. Despite this requirement, MARN did not provide, and still has not provided, PRES with any justification for MARN\u2018s inexplicable silence. Indeed, on December 5, 2008, MARN requested that PRES provide information about the same water treatment plant that PRES had already submitted in December 2006.*44*As discussed below, it is now apparent that MARN\u2018s inaction had been directed from above, and specifically from the offices of President Saca.*\n\n*65. As a result of the (overnment\u2018s inaction, PRES has been unable to obtain the exploitation concession to which it is legally entitled, and which it legitimately expected to receive upon complying with the requirements of the environmental permitting process. With the exception of the environmental permit that remains unjustifiably withheld by the government, PRES has met all of the requirements to receive the concession. Nevertheless, the company has been unable to develop any mining activities in EI Salvador over the last two years.*\n\n*D. The Exploration Licenses for Pueblos, (uaco, and Huacuco*\n\n*66. As mentioned above, in anticipation of the expiration of the exploration licenses for EI Dorado Norte and EI Dorado Sur in 2004,* *PRES engaged MINEC in discussions that same year with respect to the possibility of converting the entire area covered by the two EI Dorado exploration licenses into one exploitation concession. These discussions led to a \"carve out\" of a central portion of the two license areas, over which the exploitation concessions had been formally solicited. The area surrounding this carve-out was then divided into three small exploration areas, denominated Huacuco, Pueblos, and (uaco. MINEC agreed to grant PRC\u2018s new-established subsidiary, DOREX, three additional exploration licenses for these three areas.*\n\n*67. Thus, in September 2005, DOREX was granted exploration licenses for Huacuco, Pueblos, and (uaco by, respectively, Resolution No. 205 (dated September 28, 2005), Resolution No. 208 (dated September 29,* *2005), and Resolution No. 211 (dated September 29, 2005). DOREX* *immediately began the process of receiving the necessary environmental authorizations to continue exploration of the newly-designated sites, which had been commenced by PRES under the El Dorado Norte and El Dorado Sur exploration licenses.*\n\n*68. In November 2005, DOREX submitted an environmental permit application for the Huacuco license area to MARN. In December, MARN responded to the application with a request for an EIA regarding the impact of the exploration activities to be undertaken. The requested EIA was submitted to MARN by DOREX on February 17, 2006. MARN then asked for, and DOREX posted, public announcements regarding the EIA in May 2006. In November 2006, MARN indicated that the environmental permit for Huacuco was all but ready to be awarded, and asked that DOREX submit the required environmental financial assurance bond - a bond which is normally requested and deposited only after final approval of the relevant EIA.*\n\n*69. DOREX submitted the bond to MARN as requested. Since then, however, the Ministry has failed to act on its application, even though the Environmental Law itself requires MARN to execute the license within ten business days of approving the EIA. Moreover, although there had been some communication between DOREX and MARN in the months following the submission of the application, all communication channels inexplicably shut down in December of 2006, the same month that PRES submitted the final proposal in connection with its exploitation permit application for EI Dorado. Clearly, this silence could not be attributed to any technical problems with the applications. Indeed, with respect to Huacuco, as with respect to EI Dorado, no such problems or concerns were ever expressed.*\n\n*70. MARN\u2018s subsequent actions vis-\u00e0-vis the Enterprises followed the same pattern. Thus, in October 2006, DOREX had submitted environmental applications for both the Pueblos and Guaco exploration license areas. MARN responded to both applications within that same month, requesting that DOREX submit an EIA for each license area, which DOREX proceeded to provide in August 2007. The Ministry acknowledged receiving the Guaco EIA in November 2007, and requested that DOREX respond to observations on it. In turn, MARN acknowledged the Pueblos EIA in January 2008, and requested that the company answer observations regarding that assessment as well. Rather than express legitimate concerns, however, many of MARN\u2018s observations to the two EIAs simply requested information that had already been included within the original assessments provided to it.*\n\n*71. Nevertheless, in order to be responsive to the request, DOREX answered all the observations presented to it by the Government* *regarding the Guaco license on February 8, 2008 and regarding the Pueblos license on March 26, 2008. DOREX\u2018s responses largely reiterated and expanded upon many of the same details discussed within the original EIAs, since MARN\u2018s observations concerned information that had already been provided therein.*\n\n*72. Since responding to the observations, which should have resulted in the EIAs passing on to the public phase of the evaluation, DOREX has received no further communications from MARN regarding either the Guaco or Pueblos applications. In short, as with PRES\u2018s environmental permit application for exploitation activities on the El Dorado Sur and El Dorado Norte license areas, MARN\u2018s conduct with respect to DOREX\u2018s environmental permit applications for exploration of Huacuco, Pueblos, and Guaco reflects the arbitrary about-face in the Government\u2018s policies with respect to the Enterprises\u2018 operations in El Salvador.*\n\n*E. President Saca\u2018s 2008 Announcement of Opposition to PRC\u2018s Investment Activities*\n\n*73. Initially, the Enterprises legitimately believed that MARN\u2018s inaction was an unofficial temporary aberration, perhaps the result of bureaucracy, incompetence, inter-agency lack of communication, or some combination of those factors. As such, the Enterprises continued to meet with MARN in the hope of achieving a negotiated solution to what they considered to be only a temporary impasse, and were repeatedly assured by senior government officials that the permits would be issued imminently.*\n\n*74. In 2008, it became clear that the Government\u2018s delay tactics with respect to the issuance of the Enterprises\u2018 various permits had been designed and implemented with the unlawful, discriminatory, and politically motivated aim of preventing the Enterprises \u2018 mining operations.*\n\n*75. In March 2008, President Saca*45*publicly stated that he opposed the granting of any pending mining permits. At a press conference,* *President Saca announced that he intended to revisit the entire legal framework that was already in place to regulate mining in EI Salvador, the very system on which PRC and the Enterprises had relied in investing many tens of millions of dollars in the country. According to press accounts, President Saca stated (among other things):*\n\n*What I am saying is that, in principle, I do not agree with granting [pending mining] permits.*46\n\n*76. PRC and the Enterprises were astonished by President Saca\u2018s assertions, which were contrary to the duly adopted El Salvadoran Mining Law and the stated 2001 policy of the Government in favor of \"mining activity \" because it \"is of great importance to the economy of the country[,] as it generates investments by nationals and foreign companies, contributing in this way to the creation of jobs and development in the areas where these activities are made. \"*47*By letter dated April 14, 2008, Mr. Tom Shrake, who serves both as a Director and a Manager of PRC, wrote to President Saca:*\n\n*We have been unable to obtain a formal response from the government with respect to our proposed exploitation project for El Dorado. Similarly, our other exploration projects are awaiting receiving their respective permits, as well as our new applications for exploration licenses.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Through the press, we have noticed that you have stated that you are opposed to awarding us our operating permits. In these public statements, you have stated that, \u2018In principle I do not agree with granting these permits.\u2018*\n\n\u2026\n\n*I would also like to explain to you that the situation of Pacific Rim in El Salvador is extremely critical and precarious.* *Should we not receive a response on behalf of your government that addresses our rights as investors, our company would be in unavoidable situation of having to initiate the resolution of controversies procedure established* *in the Free Trade Agreement between Central America, the United States and the Dominican Republic (CAFTA-DR).*48\n\n*77. Nonetheless, President Saca adhered to his newly announced \"policy \" of opposing the issuance of mining permits. President Saca continued to assert that EI Salvador\u2018s existing mining law had to be rewritten. He also vaguely asserted that a \"country-wide environmental strategic study\" needed to be undertaken - while offering no other details.* *In a press interview dated July 15, 2008, President Saca was specifically asked about PRC and the Enterprises\u2018 pending permits. He responded:*\n\n*[F]or now, I will not grant mining permits, until two requirements are satisfied.*49\n\n*78. The first requirement, according to President Saca, was that new mining legislation had to be passed, notwithstanding the vested rights of PRC and the Enterprises under the existing Mining Law enacted in 1996, and amended in 2001, which remains the law today. The second requirement, he said, was for MINEC and MARN to complete a vague \u2014study \" on the possible effects of mining on the entire country. President Saca acknowledged, however, that he did not know what the study would entail, or even whether it had been started.*50*In fact, as of the date of this Notice, no such study has been completed (or to our knowledge, even commenced).*\n\n*79. Notwithstanding President Saca\u2018s comments, and the (overnment\u2018s actions and inactions, the Enterprises engaged in several meetings with the (overnment in 2008 in an effort to resolve the matter amicably.* *Nonetheless, President Saca\u2018s public statements adhered to the position he had announced in March 2008. Thus, in February 2009, President Saca was quoted in the press as stating:*\n\n*While Elias Antonio Saca is in the Presidency, he will not grant a single permit [for mining exploration], not even environmental permits, which are issued prior to [the mining permits\u2018] being granted by the Ministry of Economy.* *[PRC and the Enterprises] are about to file an international complaint and I would like to reaffirm, I would prefer to pay the $90 million then give them a permit.*51\n\n*80. Despite the Enterprises\u2018 best efforts to reach a negotiated solution with the Government, as of the time of this Notice, the Government\u2018s conduct has impeded the ability of the Enterprises to conduct mining activities and benefit from their investments. The Government has also impeded their ability to obtain further financing for their activities -financing which would without doubt be forthcoming were the permits in hand - and has thereby rendered further operation of their activities virtually impossible.*\n\n*81. In addition to EI Salvador\u2018s refusal to act upon its obligations, the Government has further compounded the unfairness of its treatment of PRC\u2018s investments by requiring the Enterprises to continue costly exploration work on those very license areas for which they have requested, but have not yet been granted, environmental permits. For example, DOREX filed all of the required annual reports for its exploration licenses over Guaco, Pueblos, and Huacuco in 2007 and 2008, and has - at significant expense - complied with the Mining Law and the Environmental Law to the extent possible without having received the environmental permits. On the other hand, MINEC representatives informed company officials that physical work such as drilling and trenching would also need to be completed on those license areas in 2008 in order to maintain them in good standing, even though DOREX cannot legally conduct these activities due to MARN\u2018s unjustified refusal to approve the EIAs submitted by DOREX in connection with those areas.*\n\n*82. The Enterprises have satisfied all legal requirements and have responded to all of the observations presented by MARN, in most cases exceeding the requirements of the law and international standards.* *Significantly, the Government has not actually denied any of the Enterprises\u2018 applications; indeed, it cannot, as it has no legal basis to do so. Instead, it has unlawfully failed to act upon these applications, thus effectively preventing the Enterprises from continuing their operations without providing them the benefit of due process, and indeed without providing any justification whatsoever for its decision. This conduct constitutes a gross abuse of administrative discretion, which is impermissible under both Salvadoran and international law.\"*\n\nSee Legislative Decree No. 544 of December 14, 1995, published in the Official Diary No. 16, Book 330, of January 24, 1996. Until 1996, mining activities in El Salvador were governed by the *C\u00f3digo de Miner\u00eda* of 1922 and the Ley *Complementaria de Mineria* of 1953. The Mining Law was amended in 2001. Legislative Decree No. 475 of July 11, 2001, published in the Official Diary No. 144, Book 352, of July 31, 2001. The Mining Law has not been modified since then.\n\n*Id.,* Preamble (emphasis added).

In 1996, in accordance with the new mining legislation that had been introduced that year, the Government confirmed Kinross-ES\u2019s exploration rights over the area for a period of three years, pursuant to Resolution No.1, dated July 10, 1996, and Resolution No.2, dated July 23, 1996. By means of those same resolutions, MINEC divided the EI Dorado exploration area into two separate claim areas, denominated \"El Dorado Norte\" and El Dorado Sur.\" The Government then twice renewed these licenses, granting a second two-year extension via resolutions dated December 10, 2001. Inc., which sold its license to explore the area to Kinross EI Salvador, Sociedad Anonima de Capital Variable (\"Kinross-ES\") in 1993.

PRC\u2019s last updates of its registered investment in the Enterprises are here attached as composite Exhibit 3.\n\nAs explained in greater detail below, when PRES sought an exploitation concession for El Dorado Norte and El Dorado Sur in 2004, MINEC explained that it could not approve a concession covering such a large area. The parties agreed to \"carve out\" the smaller areas of Huacuco, Pueblos, and Guaco, which would be the subject of a separate administrative process.\n\nIn December 2003, for example, MINEC recognized PRES as the new holder of the El Dorado Norte and El Dorado Sur exploration licenses, and also granted PRES additional extensions to both exploration licenses via MINEC Resolutions Nos. 191 and 192. *See* composite Exhibit 4. Likewise, MARN granted the company environmental permits for exploration activities undertaken on the El Dorado Norte and El Dorado Sur license areas on June 15, 2004, by means of MARN Resolution No. 151-2004. *See* Exhibit 5.  \n A further example of the Government\u2019s prior interest and willingness to allow and support PRC\u2019s mining operations is shown by PRES\u2019s experience with the Santa Rita exploration license. On July 8, 2005, MINEC granted an exploration license to PRES to search for minerals in Santa Rita, a mining claim near El Dorado. Accordingly, in September 2005, PRES applied to MARN to receive the environmental permit related to the exploration of the Santa Rita License. During this process, PRES filed an EIA and participated in the public consultation process as required by the Environmental Law. On May 30, 2006, MARN granted the requested environmental permit. These Government\u2019s actions with respect to the initial development of Santa Rita strengthened PRC\u2019s expectations that it would receive similar environmental permits for its other claims, including El Dorado.  \n Time would tell that the Santa Rita permit would be the last that PRC and the Enterprises would receive from the Government. Although PRES has received both the exploration license and environmental permit for Santa Rita, and has invested substantial resources in exploration activities, the Government\u2019s recent actions and current attitude towards mining has made any further development of this claim area impossible. PRC\u2019s claim includes its lost investments in connection with Santa Rita.\n\nPreviously known and doing business as Kinross-ES.\n\nSee Exhibit 6.\n\nOn December 8, 2008, in response to this request, PRES informed MARN that its request had already been answered during the EIA review process.\n\nPresident Saca came into power in March 2004. He was recently voted out of office and will be replaced by President-elect Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena as of June 1, 2009.\n\nSee Exhibit 7. The original Spanish text reads in pertinent part: \"El presidente de El Salvador, Elias Antonio Saca, asegur\u00f3 este martes que \"en principio\u2019 se opone a la concesi\u00f3n de permisos para nuevas explotaciones mineras en el pa\u00eds y pidi\u00f3 al Congreso estudiar el tema a profundidad. \"El tema de la miner\u00eda es un tema que hay que estudiarlo a profundidad.

The original Spanish text reads: \"Mientras El\u00edas Antonio Saca est\u00e9 en la presidencia, no otorgar\u00e1 ni un tan solo permiso, (para 1a explotaci\u00f3n minera) ni siquiera permisos ambientales, que son previos a los que otorga el Ministerio de Econom\u00eda\" and \"Est\u00e1n a punto de entablar una demanda internacional y les quiero dejar claro algo, prefiero pagar los $90 millones a darles un permiso.\"\n\n***C: President Saca***\n-----------------------\n\n76.\n\nIt will be noted that the Claimant\u2019s allegations address specifically several statements attributed to the Respondent\u2019s Head of State from 2004 to 2009, President Saca, particularly the statements allegedly made by him in March 2008 (as set out above in paragraph 75 of the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration), July 2008 (paragraph 77, *ibid*) and February 2009 (paragraph 78, *ibid*).\n\n77.\n\nIt suffices for present purposes to address only the first of these alleged statements. As published, it formed part of a press report from AFP dated 11 March 2008, exhibited to the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration (Exhibit 7); and it merits citing here in full, as translated into English:\n\n*\u2018Salvador - Mining*\n\n*President of El Salvador asks for caution regarding mining exploitation projects*\n\n*The President of El Salvador, Elias Antonio Saca, stated on Tuesday that \"in principle \" he is against the granting ofpermits for new mining exploitations in the country and asked the Congress to review this issue in depth.*\n\n*\"The issue of mining is a matter that must be reviewed in depth. I understand that the members of the House of Representatives have formed a committee (and) that a law must be made, the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of the Economy are working hand in hand with the representatives.\" Saca stated at a press conference.*\n\n*\"What I am saying is that, in principle, I am not in favor of granting those permits\", the president said in reference to the 26 mining projects that are applying for exploitation permits.*\n\n*Mining exploitation is opposed by the church and the left-wing opposition, since it is believed to contaminate the aquifers and to destroy the environment in general, within the limited territory of 20,742 km& belonging to El Salvador.*\n\n*\"We want to generate a space to reflect on the benefits or disadvantages of mining. And after we reflect on it, and we\u2018re shown proof that green mining exists and that it is possible to grant the exploitation permits,* *which is what we have not given them, at that time, a law must be made to make everything very clear,\" emphatically declared President Saca.*\n\n*Last February, the Salvadoran Congress began the consultations for the approval of this controversial law with warnings, from environmental organizations and the Church, asking representatives to act \"prudently \" while alleging that the health of the population is at stake.*\n\n*One of the first persons to oppose these mining projects was the archbishop of San Salvador. Fernando S\u00e1enz, who considered the use of cyanide and cadmium for gold exploitation unacceptable, since they were \"extremely poisonous \" and because they \"contaminate the aquifers.\"*\n\n*Mining companies, to diminish criticism, have emphasized in several messages the advantages of the so-called \"green mining\" for the country, which, with new techniques - they claim - may reduce damages to the environment.\u2018*\n\n78.\n\nUnder CAFTA Article 10.20.4(c), as further explained immediately below in Part V, the Tribunal is not permitted, at this early stage of these arbitration proceedings, to investigate whether or not President Saca in fact made any of the statements recorded in this or other press reports quoted by the Claimant, nor even to decide whether these reports (if accurate) support a quite different interpretation from that alleged by the Claimant, when taking into account a more complete factual context.\n\n79.\n\nIn regard to the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20.4, the Tribunal is accordingly obliged to assume, at this stage of these proceedings and taking all relevant factors into account, that the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of President Saca\u2019s reported statements, as pleaded in the Notice of Arbitration, are not fanciful or so unreasonable as relevant alleged facts as to be disregarded by the Tribunal for present purposes. In other words, here as elsewhere recorded in this decision, the Claimant\u2019s factual allegations pleaded in the Notice of Arbitration, as set out above, must be assumed to be true in accordance with the express requirements of CAFTA Article 10.20.4(c) for the purpose of deciding the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections.\n\n***PART V: CAFTA ARTICLE 10.20.4***\n-----------------------------------\n\n***A: Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s necessary starting-point in addressing the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections (it being common ground between the Parties) is the meaning and effect of CAFTA Article 10.20.4 (with Article 10.20.5), interpreted and applied as part of CAFTA under international law: see also CAFTA Article 10.22 cited in Part III above.\n\n***B: CAFTA Article 10.20.4***\n------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Parties agreed to use CAFTA\u2019s expedited procedure for the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections to the Claimant\u2019s claims because (i) these arbitration proceedings are subject to the ICSID Arbitration Rules; (ii) the first sentence of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) expressly provides that the procedure under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) does not apply if \"the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections...\"; and (iii) the Parties are here taken to have consented to \"another expedited procedure\" in the form of CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that CAFTA Article 10.20.5 allows a respondent to make a preliminary objection with regard to competence to be decided on an expedited basis; and that CAFTA Article 10.20.5, when used in conjunction with CAFTA Article 10.20.4, also allows a respondent to have a preliminary objection decided on an expedited basis. Therefore, so the Respondent concludes, CAFTA Article 10.20.5, either alone or in conjunction with CAFTA Article 10.20.4, constitutes an agreement by the CAFTA Contracting States to \"another expedited procedure\" for making preliminary objections.\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant also agreed to submit to the CAFTA expedited procedure for making preliminary objections when it submitted its Notice of Arbitration. In its amended Exhibit 1 to its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant affirmed:\n\n*\"Pursuant to Article 10.18(2)(a) of the Central America - United States -Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (\"CAFTA\"), Pac Rim Cayman LLC (\"PRC\") hereby consents to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in CAFTA.\"*\n\n84.\n\nIn addition, so the Respondent submits, CAFTA Article 10.16.5 makes clear that CAFTA provisions pre-empt any different provision in the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Therefore, so the Respondent concludes, the Parties to this arbitration have agreed to use the CAFTA expedited procedure for preliminary objections, to the exclusion of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5); and the Parties\u2019 agreement extends to all claims made by the Claimant in these ICSID arbitration proceedings.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal is content to accept the Respondent\u2019s submissions on the application to these ICSID proceedings of CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 as an expedited procedure. Indeed, the Tribunal understood that these submissions were not materially disputed by the Claimant.\n\n***C: The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Parties disputed the general approach to and standard of review under CAFTA Article 10.20.4. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, these matters can be decided as follows:\n\n87.\n\n*The General Approach* : The procedure under CAFTA Article 10.20.4 mandates the tribunal to assume the relevant factual allegations made by the claimant to be \"true\", without any express qualification, namely:\n\n88.\n\n\"In deciding an objection under this paragraph [10.20.4], the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant\u2019s factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof).\"\n\n89.\n\nIt is to be noted that these factual allegations can extend beyond the original notice of arbitration to include further factual allegations in an amended notice of arbitration up to the time of the tribunal\u2019s decision. This ability of a claimant to cure a notice of arbitration by pleading further factual allegations confirms that the procedure is not intended to be a technical pleading exercise where mere linguistic form should prevail over substance to the detriment of an ill-pleaded notice of arbitration.\n\n90.\n\nHowever, it is only the notice (or amended notice) of arbitration which benefits from a presumption of truthfulness: there is to be no assumption of truth as regards factual allegations made elsewhere, for example in other written or oral submissions made by a claimant to the tribunal under the procedure for addressing the respondent\u2019s preliminary objection. In the present case, therefore, this assumption does not extend to any factual allegation in the Claimant\u2019s Response, Rejoinder and submissions at the Oral Hearing.\n\n91.\n\nIt is also only \"factual allegations\" that are assumed to be true under this procedure. The phrase does not include any legal allegations. It could not therefore include a legal allegation clothed as a factual allegation. Nor could it include a mere conclusion unsupported by any relevant factual allegation without depriving the procedure of any practical application. In short, the Tribunal concludes, again, that substance must clearly prevail over form under this procedure.\n\n92.\n\nMoreover, the procedure under CAFTA Article 10.20.4 is to be read with CAFTA Articles 10.16.1 and 10.16.2 which requires a claimant\u2019s notice of intent to claim liability for a breach and to \"specify\" (*inter alia*):\n\n*\u2014(b) for each claim the provision of [CAFTA], investment authorization, or investment agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions;*\n\n*(b) the legal and factual basis for each claim; and*\n\n*(c) the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed.\"*\n\n93.\n\nIt would therefore be impermissible for a claimant to evade pleading the factual basis for each of its claims in the notice of intent: a mere conclusion could not specify a factual basis. Accordingly, liability, causation and damages must be pleaded under CAFTA Article 10.16.1 and Article 10.16.2(b), (c) and (d) as regards the notice of intent.\n\n94.\n\nUnder CAFTA, the same requirement does not apply expressly to the subsequent notice of arbitration under the ICSID Convention, because of the limitation contained in CAFTA Article 10.16.5. It provides (as here relevant) that the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Institution and Arbitration Rules shall govern the arbitration \"except to the extent modified by this Agreement\"; and there is no such modification in CAFTA regarding the content of the notice of arbitration (or \"Request for Arbitration\") in ICSID arbitration proceedings.\n\n95.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant\u2019s pleading in its Notice of Arbitration must here meet the requirements of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Institution and Arbitration Rules. Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 2(e) of the Institution Rules impose like obligations to plead liability, causation and damages. (Although differently worded from the equivalent provisions in CAFTA, these differences are not material in the present case).\n\n96.\n\nThere is however an essential difference between the initial pleading by a claimant, such as a notice of arbitration, and a claimant\u2019s full presentation of its case at a hearing on the merits under the ICSID Convention. The initial pleading cannot and is not required to be a complete documentary record of the claimant\u2019s factual evidence and legal argument. Indeed, a notice may contain few factual exhibits and still fewer legal materials.\n\n97.\n\nIt is clear from the ICSID Convention (as also CAFTA), that the initial pleading will ordinarily be followed within the written phase by several more substantive written submissions, documentary exhibits, witness statements and expert reports (including document production from the adverse party), before even passing to the oral phase and an evidential hearing on the merits. If the initial pleading was intended to be complete, there would be no purpose in these subsequent steps.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the particular approach to Article 36 and Rule 2 taken by Professor Schreuer and his distinguished colleagues in *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* *(2009),* at page 463: \"Article 36(2) requires that \"information\u2019 on these points be contained in the request. Institution Rule 2 says that the request must \"designate\u2019, \"state\u2019, \"indicate\u2019 and \"contain information.\u2019 Therefore no proof is required at this stage. On most points a mere assertion in the request will suffice and the information thus given may be developed at a later stage....\" By assertion, the Tribunal assumes these authors to mean an appropriate statement specifying the factual and legal bases of the claim, without evidential proof.\n\n99.\n\nWhilst the request of arbitration must be adequately pleaded, with relevant factual allegations under the ICSID Convention and Rules, it cannot therefore be equated to the fine-tuned instrument which emerges at the later stages of ICSID arbitration proceedings; for example: a party\u2019s main pleadings, closing oral submissions or comprehensive post-hearing brief. Accordingly, a notice of arbitration, at the very start of the arbitration, is not therefore to be judged by a formalistic standard more appropriate to a later pleading.\n\n100.\n\nIn addition to factual allegations in the Notice of Arbitration, by CAFTA Article 10.20.4(c)\u2019s last sentence, the tribunal may also consider relevant facts not in dispute between the parties:\n\n*\"The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.\"*\n\n101.\n\nThe meaning of these words is plain. First, unlike the previous mandate (\"shall\"), it grants to the tribunal a power which the tribunal may or may not choose to exercise in the circumstances of the particular case (\"may\"). The Tribunal returns below to a similar factor, \"may,\" in the context of CAFTA Article 10.20.4 (line 4).\n\n102.\n\nSecond, it operates bilaterally, meaning that a factual admission by a claimant of a fact alleged by a respondent can be considered by the tribunal, just as a factual admission by a respondent of a fact alleged by a claimant.\n\n103.\n\nThird, although undisputed facts are not necessarily required to emerge from the notice (or amended notice) of arbitration for this procedure, these facts must be undisputed at the time of the tribunal\u2019s decision given the opening words of Article 10.20.4(c) (\"In deciding an objection under this paragraph...\").\n\n104.\n\nFourth, there can in practice be no dispute between the parties as to whether or not a fact is undisputed. For example, it would suffice for a claimant to withdraw its assertion or admission of a fact by an amended notice of arbitration to convert a hitherto undisputed fact into a disputed fact before the tribunal\u2019s decision. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, if that can be achieved in regard to a formal pleading, it can be equally achieved informally by a claimant or respondent as regards a fact not pleaded in the notice of arbitration. It is significant that, unlike the earlier part of this subarticle, the tribunal is not mandated to assume an undisputed fact to be true: it can only consider \"a fact\", not a factual allegation, because the fact is effectively agreed between the parties.\n\n105.\n\nAccordingly, for all these reasons, the Tribunal approaches the procedure under CAFTA Article 10.20.4 tempered by a lack of formalism, with an emphasis on substance and practical common-sense.\n\n106.\n\nAs regards the expedited procedure under Article 10.20.5, it is twinned with the procedure under Article 10.20.4 with an additional ground of objection as to competence:\n\n*\"In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal\u2018s competence...\"*\n\n107.\n\nIt is significant that the several deadlines under this expedited procedure are stringent, both for the parties (and the parties\u2019 legal representatives) and also for the tribunal. It is not intended to be a \"mini-trial\", even without evidence.\n\n108.\n\n*The Standard of Review:* The Tribunal does not consider that the standard of review under Article 10.20.4 is limited to \"frivolous\" claims or \"legally impossible\" claims, contrary to the submissions of the Claimant. These words could have been used by the Contracting Parties in agreeing CAFTA; but all are significantly absent. Moreover, the implied addition of these or similar words would significantly restrict the arbitral remedy under Article 10.20.4, when the structure of this provision permits a more natural and effective interpretation consistent with its object and purpose.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal does consider that the word \"may\" in Article 10.20.4 (line 4) confers an important arbitral power in whether to grant or refuse a preliminary objection, to be exercised reasonably in all the circumstances of the particular case. The word \"may\" is not \"must\" or otherwise mandatory. The same meaning is evident from CAFTA\u2019s authentic language: the Spanish phrase \"se pueda\" is to the same effect as the English \"may.\" In context, reversing the negative approach in Article 10.20.4, the word recognises a position where a tribunal considers that an award could eventually be made upholding the claimant\u2019s claim or, equally, where the tribunal considers that it was premature at this early stage of the arbitration proceedings to decide whether or not such an award could not be made.\n\n110.\n\nIn other words, returning to the negative language of Article 10.20.4, to grant a preliminary objection, a tribunal must have reached a position, both as to all relevant questions of law and all relevant alleged or undisputed facts, that an award should be made finally dismissing the claimant\u2019s claim at the very outset of the arbitration proceedings, without more. Depending on the particular circumstances of each case, there are many reasons why a tribunal might reasonably decide not to exercise such a power against a claimant, even where it considered that such a claim appeared likely (but not certain) to fail if assessed only at the time of the preliminary objection.\n\n111.\n\nAt all times during this exercise under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5, the burden of persuading the tribunal to grant the preliminary objection must rest on the party making that objection, namely the respondent.\n\n112.\n\nGiven the tight procedural timetable and deadlines under CAFTA Article 10.20.5, as already indicated above, it is clear that an expedited preliminary objection is not intended to lead to a \"mini-trial.\u2019 A contrary conclusion would attribute to the CAFTA Contracting Parties a perverse intention to render investor-state arbitration even more expensive and procedurally difficult for the disputing parties, when it would seem from these provisions (read as a whole) that the actual intention of the Contracting Parties was, manifestly, the exact opposite. The procedure under CAFTA Article 10.20.4 is clearly intended to avoid the time and cost of a trial and not to replicate it. To that end, there can be no evidence from the respondent contradicting the assumed facts alleged in the notice of arbitration; and it should not ordinarily be necessary to address at length complex issues of law, still less legal issues dependent on complex questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact.\n\n113.\n\nMoreover, it may be correct, as the Claimant submitted, that the non-waiver provision in Article 10.20.4(d) as to competence may allow a further intermediate stage under the ICSID Arbitration Rules before the claimant can reach the merits, thereby leading a respondent to have, in the Claimant\u2019s words, \"more than one bite at the cherry.\" If this approach were correct (albeit recently doubted by another CAFTA tribunal), there would therefore be a further reason not to make the procedure under Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 even more onerous for the disputing parties than it may be already.\n\n114.\n\nLastly, as already indicated, as the party invoking these procedures it is of course for the Respondent to discharge the burden of satisfying the Tribunal that it should make a final decision dismissing the relevant claim or claims pleaded by the Claimant in these arbitration proceedings.\n\n***D: The Tribunal's Conclusion:***\n-----------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal has reached this interpretation of CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 based upon the plain and unambiguous meaning of their respective wording and the principles of customary international law declared in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. (The Respondent and the USA have signed but not ratified the Vienna Convention).\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the object and purpose of these two provisions is to create, under CAFTA, an effective and flexible procedure for the swift and fair resolution of disputes between claimant investors and respondent host states, to be exercised reasonably by a tribunal according to all the circumstances of the particular case.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal was not materially assisted by comparisons between these provisions and national court procedures in one Contracting Party, the USA, as evidenced by its President\u2019s Message of 2005 and several decisions of US courts, including the decisions of the US Supreme Court in *Neitzke v. Williams* and *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*. Not only is that message from one Contracting Party not replicated by other Contracting Parties to CAFTA, there is also no reason to equate such common law court procedures to provisions in CAFTA agreed by Contracting Parties with different legal traditions and national court procedures.\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal was also not materially assisted by comparisons with NAFTA or the New ICSID Arbitration Rule 41.5, which have different wording and do not share exactly the same object and purpose. Accordingly, the Tribunal has placed no reliance in this decision on the Decision of 12 May 2008 in *Trans-Global v. Jordan* and the Decision of 2 February 2009 in *Brandes v. Venezuela.* Nonetheless, the Tribunal has considered these and other legal materials, from which doubtless much more could still be learnt in other more appropriate cases.\n\n***PART VI: THE APPLICATION OF CAFTA ARTICLES 10.20.4 AND 10.20.5***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A: Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n119.\n\nIt is now appropriate to apply to the Parties\u2019 respective cases the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5.\n\n120.\n\nOf the four exploration areas of which the Claimant complains in the Notice of Arbitration, three exploration areas (Guaco, Huacuco and Pueblos) surround the area of the intended El Dorado concession. The Respondent does not currently object to these claims in its Preliminary Objections; but the Respondent seeks to reserve all its rights regarding these claims to a later stage of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n***B: The Respondent's Case***\n------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nFirst, tracking the Respondent\u2019s written and oral submissions, albeit not *verbatim* and omitting documentary and legal references, the Tribunal here summarises the Respondent\u2019s submissions regarding the Claimant\u2019s claims subjected to the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections: (i) the El Dorado Claim; (ii) the Santa Rita Claim, (iii) Other CAFTA Claims; and (iv) Non-CAFTA Claims. As already indicated above, this summary records the Respondent\u2019s submissions and not the views of the Tribunal.\n\n122.\n\n***The El Dorado Claim*** *:* The Respondent submits that, as acknowledged by the Claimant in the Notice of Arbitration, the provisions for the granting of a mining exploitation concession under Salvadoran law are \"plain and explicit\" under Article 37 of the Mining Law. The specific documents the Claimant identifies as being required to obtain the mining exploitation concession are described in paragraph 35 of the Notice of Arbitration (quoted above in Part IV).\n\n123.\n\nIn addition to an Environmental Permit, these include: (i) a showing that the licensee owns or is authorised to use the real estate property where the mine project is located and (ii) an *Estudio de Factibilidad T\u00e9cnico Econ\u00f3mico* (or \"Feasibility Study\").\n\n124.\n\nIn its Notice of Arbitration, according to the Respondent, the Claimant asserts the legal conclusion that PRES is entitled to obtain the El Dorado concession but for the lack of the Environmental Permit. The Claimant asserts that, under Salvadoran law, a company that holds an exploration license has a \"right to obtain the exploitation concession... [and] that right is perfected upon the discovery and demonstration of the existence of mineable ore deposits in the license area in accordance with Article 23 [of the Mining Law]\": see paragraph 37 of the Notice of Arbitration (quoted above in Part IV).\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant is legally wrong in both its assertion that there is an automatic right to a mining exploitation concession under Salvadoran law and its conclusion that it has complied with the minimum requirements of the Mining Law for the granting of an exploitation concession.\n\n126.\n\nFirst, the Mining Law does not give to holders of exploration licenses automatic rights to exploitation concessions. The Claimant provides a self-serving interpretation of the Mining Law by focusing exclusively on one clause of Article 23 and ignoring the rest of that provision and the related provisions in Articles 40-43. These provisions specify the governmental decision-making process applicable to exploitation concessions, as well as the Ministry of Economy\u2019s authority to grant or deny such applications. Full compliance with all the formal requirements of the Law simply affords an applicant the legal right of having its application considered by the Ministry and not a legal right to the grant of such application.\n\n127.\n\nSecond, whilst the Claimant makes allegations related to PRES\u2019 inability to obtain an Environmental Permit, nowhere in its Notice of Arbitration does the Claimant allege that PRES submitted the other specified documents or complied with the other individual requirements to obtain the concession.\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent contends that this lack of any factual allegations relating to these legal requirements does not meet the demands of CAFTA Article 10.16.2(c) for the \"legal and factual basis for each claim\" for a Notice of Intent, still less for a Notice of Arbitration.\n\n129.\n\nAccording to the Mining Law, the Respondent contends that there is no automatic right to a concession, even if the applicant has submitted all the required documents. The Mining Law sets out a series of steps for reviewing the application after its submission, including publication and solicitation of comments from interested parties opposing the application. The solicitation of comments from interested parties would be a meaningless requirement if, as the Claimant asserts, the Respondent had no option but to issue the concession to the Claimant and the Enterprises.\n\n130.\n\nUnder the Mining Law, so the Respondent also contends, the Ministry of Economy\u2019s Department of Hydrocarbons and Mines (also called the \"Bureau of Mines\") can reject or accept the application; and, in accordance with Article 43 of the Mining Law, the final decision on whether to grant the concession is left to the Minister of Economy.\n\n131.\n\nThus, the Resolution by the Ministry of Economy *(\u2014Acuerdo del Ministerio\")* under Article 23 of the Mining Law is only one of several possible outcomes for a concession application under Articles 36 to 43 of the Mining Law. As was the position at the time when Pacific Rim decided to make its investment in El Salvador in 2002, far from being \"required to grant the licensee the concession\", the Ministry of Economy is given authority within the limits of Salvadoran law to approve or deny an exploitation concession application, taking into consideration the public interest and several other factors.\n\n132.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Articles 36 to 38 of the Mining Law regulate the verification by the Bureau of Mines that the application includes the formal requirements stated in the Mining Law. If these formal requirements are included in the application, and after completing an initial inspection, the Bureau of Mines will register the application and will begin the administrative process for adjudicating upon the application.\n\n133.\n\nIf, however, there is a failure by the applicant to meet any of these requirements, the Bureau of Mines will grant a maximum, non-extendable period of thirty days for the applicant to remedy the deficiency. If the deficiency is not cured in the thirty-day period, the Bureau of Mines must deny the application and close the file.\n\n134.\n\nMoreover, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s case, even if the application meets the formal requirements in the Mining Law and is registered by the Bureau of Mines, the Mining Law does not provide for the concession to be automatically granted. Rather, the registration of the application triggers an administrative decision-making process that may still result in the denial of the application at different stages.\n\n135.\n\nFirst, according to the Respondent, Article 40 of the Mining Law sets out a process for publication. The Bureau of Mines must make sure that the applicant publishes a note in the official gazette and in two newspapers with the largest circulation in the country, with a summary of the application for the exploitation concession. In addition, the Bureau of Mines must send the summary of the application to the municipality where the mining project is located to be posted in the town hall.\n\n136.\n\nSecond, according to the Respondent, Article 41 of the Mining Law provides for a period of fifteen days after the publication of the notice in the official gazette for persons from the general public who have a legitimate interest in the application, or who believe that they will be negatively affected by the proposed concession, to express their opposition to the application. Article 41 provides that the Bureau of Mines will consider the objections and the applicant\u2019s response, and then decide whether to allow the process to continue or to stop there if the objections are well-founded. Either the objecting members of the public or the applicant can appeal the decision of the Bureau of Mines to the Minister of Economy.\n\n137.\n\nThird, according to the Respondent, if the application process is allowed to continue, Article 42 of the Mining Law requires the Bureau of Mines to demarcate the area of the requested concession with sturdy markers. Once this process is concluded, the Bureau of Mines submits the matter to the Minister of Economy for his decision.\n\n138.\n\nFinally, according to the Respondent, Article 43 of the Mining Law gives to the Minister the power to deny the concession if granting the concession would be unjustified. This provision gives to the Minister authority to evaluate the contents of the application file and order any investigations and inspections the Minister considers necessary. Article 15 of the Mining Regulations also provides factors that the Minister (and previously the Bureau of Mines) must take into account in deciding whether or not to grant the mining exploitation concession, including the national interest, the financial and technical capacity of the applicant, and the characteristics of the proposed mining operation.\n\n139.\n\nIn accordance with Article 43 of the Mining Law, the applicant can request reconsideration of an unfavourable resolution regarding the concession, which will be decided upon by the Minister. The Minister\u2019s decision on a request for reconsideration cannot be appealed.\n\n140.\n\nThus, the Respondent submits that Articles 40 to 43 of the Mining Law demonstrate that there is no such thing as an \"automatic\" right to a mining exploitation concession; and the Claimant\u2019s allegation in regard to El Dorado is legally wrong. In other words, even if PRES had met all the formal requirements of Articles 36 and 37 of the Mining Law (which it did not), PRES\u2019s application would still have been subject to the substantive technical evaluation of the submission, the public comment process and the legal power of the Minister of Economy to grant or deny the application.\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is therefore clear, as a matter of law (not fact), that PRES did not have a \"perfected\" right to a mining exploitation concession; and that the Claimant cannot receive any relief in this arbitration for the alleged breach of a right which PRES never had. Accordingly, as a matter of law, the Respondent submits that the claim relating to El Dorado is not a claim for which an award in favour of the Claimant may be made under CAFTA Article 10.26.\n\n142.\n\nMoreover, in addition to the lack of the automatic right to an exploitation concession under the Mining Law as alleged by the Claimant, even assuming the existence of such a right, PRES\u2019 application for a concession could not have been approved by the Bureau of Mines or by the Minister of Economy because the application did not comply with two separate requirements of the Mining Law recognized by the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration.\n\n143.\n\nAs to these, the Respondent contends that the Claimant did not plead any factual allegations in the Notice of Arbitration demonstrating that PRES had met the separate requirements of Article 37 of the Mining Law, other than claiming that PRES was entitled to the Environmental Permit. The Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s silence was not surprising, as the undisputed facts (all deriving from the Claimant) demonstrate that PRES had in fact not complied with these legal requirements in these two respects, as described below.\n\n144.\n\nAs the Claimant contends, there is a two-stage framework for mining in El Salvador: (i) an exploration phase and (ii) an extraction, or exploitation, phase. The Mining Law contains procedures for petitioning the Government for (i) exploration licenses and (ii) exploitation concessions. The requirements for an exploitation concession are necessarily distinct from the requirements for an exploration license.\n\n145.\n\nAn exploration license is obtained with the goal of identifying whether there are valuable minerals in the ground and where they are located. The area for the exploitation concession must be determined based on what was found during exploration. Article 24 of the Mining Law provides that the mining exploitation concession area must be within the exploration area and that the surface area must be determined by the size of the mineral deposits and the technical justifications of the exploration license holder.\n\n146.\n\nAccording to Article 37 of the Mining Law, an applicant for an exploitation concession must present, among other requirements, (i) documentation of ownership or authorization to use all the property that corresponds to the area of the concession and (ii) a technical and economic feasibility study, as the Claimant acknowledges in its Notice of Arbitration (see paragraph 35, quoted above in Part IV).\n\n147.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant not only failed to allege relevant facts to show that PRES complied with these two requirements, but the undisputed facts (from the Claimant\u2019s own documents) demonstrate that PRES actually did not comply (and still does not comply) with these two requirements. Nor is there any allegation that the Respondent in any way hindered PRES from complying with these two essential requirements. In short, the Claimant has failed to plead the relevant facts demonstrating PRES\u2019 entitlement to the exploitation concession at issue, not by inadvertence but because such facts do not exist to its own knowledge and could not be pleaded in good faith in its Notice of Arbitration.\n\n148.\n\n*The Property Issue:* The first of these two requirements requires a showing that the applicant owns or is authorised to use the real estate property where the mine project is located; that is, the requirement to own or have authorization to use all the property covering the area of the exploitation concession being requested by the applicant.\n\n149.\n\nNowhere in its Notice of Arbitration does the Claimant allege any facts to support an allegation of such ownership or authorization. The reason is again simple: the undisputed facts show that it has no such ownership or authorization.\n\n150.\n\nBeginning with the application itself, PRES did not allege that it owned or had permission to use the surface area over the requested concession. The concession for which PRES applied consists of an area of 12.75 square kilometres. Yet PRES provided proof of ownership or authorization to use only approximately 1.6 square kilometres, *i.e.* a mere 13% of the total area requested for the concession.\n\n151.\n\nThis deficiency in its application for a mining exploitation concession was indicated to PRES by a letter from the Bureau of Mines dated October 2, 2006, pursuant to Article 31 of the Mining Regulations. This letter gave to PRES thirty days to submit (among other documents) certified copies of the registered land purchases or authorizations for the land subject to the concession.\n\n152.\n\nIn response to this letter, PRES merely re-submitted the same documents which PRES had already submitted with its original application, making no mention of any additional land. The Claimant has never alleged that PRES owns or has authorisation to use all the property included in its application. PRES does not have and has never claimed to have authorization to use the rest of the area applied for (11,985 square kilometres); and PRES has therefore not complied with the requirement of Article 37 of the Mining Law regarding ownership or authorization to use this land.\n\n153.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, based both on the Claimant\u2019s failure to allege facts in its Notice of Arbitration showing compliance with the requirements of the Mining Law and upon the undisputed facts from the Claimant\u2019s own documents, that PRES never met what the Claimant admits is one of the \"plain and explicit\" requirements to obtain a mining exploitation concession under Salvadoran law: namely, making a showing that the applicant licensee owns or is authorissed to use the property where the mine project is located. Having not met this essential requirement, PRES did not have any right to the mining exploitation concession in El Dorado; and the Claimant\u2019s pleaded claim must therefore fail on this ground alone.\n\n154.\n\n*Feasibility Study:* The Respondent submits that the second requirement that PRES did not meet concerned the Feasibility Study under Article 37 of the Mining Law.\n\n155.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration notes this requirement; but, according to the Respondent, it then fails to allege anywhere that PRES ever submitted a completed Feasibility Study, still less any study covering the entire area in respect of which PRES applied for a mining exploitation concession.\n\n156.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, PRES submitted only a \"Preliminary Pre-Feasibility Study.\" At the time, PRES distinguished this from the required final Feasibility Study, which it admitted was not complete. PRES submitted a \"final\" but still \"PreFeasibility Study\" in January 2005; but it never submitted the Feasibility Study required by the Mining Law.\n\n157.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the application explained that PRES would need more time and money fully to explore the area for which it had exploration licenses. Nevertheless, in its application, PRES included a request for the right to exploit areas that had not been completely explored, and for which it had not submitted an environmental impact assessment. This addition was not based on the Mining Law, but rather on PRES\u2019s unilateral opinion of how it could maximize its own benefits: PRES argued that due to the cost of constructing the mine and beginning operations, it would not be reasonable to limit the area of the exploitation concession.\n\n158.\n\nThe Bureau of Mines\u2019 letter of October 2006 to PRES also alerted PRES to its failure to provide the required Feasibility Study. It likewise gave to PRES thirty days to submit the Feasibility Study with detailed plans. Again, PRES simply re-submitted its Pre-Feasibility Study and added the requested plans for the six specific areas requested; and the required Feasibility Study was never submitted by PRES.\n\n159.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the difference between a Pre-Feasibility Study and a Feasibility Study is not merely in name. For example, Article 24 of the Mining Law specifically ties the surface area of the concession to the size of the mineral deposits and the technical justifications provided by the license holder. Thus, an applicant has to justify in a Feasibility Study the reason why it deserves to be awarded the concession area which it is requesting. The Pre-Feasibility Study commissioned by Pacific Rim by its terms demonstrates that it was clearly insufficient for this purpose; and PRES was not, in fact, in a position even to prepare the required Feasibility Study because it was requesting a concession area larger than it could justify based on the exploration and technical work it had undertaken.\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent submits that PRES thus never completed the required Feasibility Study to allow the Ministry of Economy properly to evaluate whether or not to grant the concession and, if so, whether PRES had provided justification, and showed the technical and economic capacity, for the 12.75 square kilometres area it was requesting for the exploitation concession.\n\n161.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that this failure to complete and submit a Feasibility Study, at the time when PRES submitted its application (and ever since), is a failure to comply with the second essential requirement clearly stated in the Mining Law for obtaining an exploitation concession. Thus, so the Respondent submits, the Claimant\u2019s conclusionary statement that, \"[w]ith the exception of the environmental permit that remains unjustifiably withheld by the Government, PRES has met all of the requirements to receive the [exploitation] concession\", is wholly unsupported by its own factual allegations.\n\n162.\n\nIn summary, as regards these two requirements the Respondent submits that the provisions in Salvadoran law requiring an exploitation concession applicant to submit specific documents do not violate any provisions of CAFTA or the Salvadoran Investment Law; that the Respondent complied with the Mining law in granting to PRES thirty days to remedy its deficient application; that PRES did not submit the required documentation; and that PRES thus failed to meet the essential requirements for the mining exploitation concession under Salvadoran law. As a result, any failure by the Government to issue the Environmental Permit has caused the Claimant no legal harm. The Claimant\u2019s claim for El Dorado is frivolous; it must fail *in limine* ; and it should be dismissed by the Tribunal under CAFTA Article 10.20.4.\n\n163.\n\n***Santa Rita Claim:*** The Respondent seeks the dismissal of the Claimant\u2019s claim relating to the fourth exploration area included in the Notice of Arbitration, known as Santa Rita.\n\n164.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant does not include any allegation of wrongdoing by the Respondent in its Notice of Arbitration relating to Santa Rita. To the contrary, the Claimant pleads that the Respondent has granted all permits with regard to Santa Rita. However, without any factual or legal basis, the Claimant has decided to include its alleged \"lost investments in connection with Santa Rita\" in this arbitration.\n\n165.\n\nIn any event, the claims related to Santa Rita are completely without factual or legal basis because PRES no longer holds an exploration license in Santa Rita. PRES failed to request the renewal of the exploration license before its term expired, as required by the Mining Law and Mining Regulations.\n\n166.\n\nTherefore, so the Respondent concludes, because neither the Claimant nor the Enterprises hold an exploration license in Santa Rita, the Claimant does not have any rights in Santa Rita upon which to base any claim against the Respondent in these arbitration proceedings. The claim relating to Santa Rita should therefore be dismissed by the Tribunal under CAFTA Article 10.20.4.\n\n167.\n\n***Other CAFTA Claims:*** The Respondent first contends that the Claimant has failed in its Notice of Arbitration to provide any factual bases for its claims of violation of CAFTA Articles 10.3 (National Treatment) and 10.4 (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment). Specifically, according to the Respondent, the Claimant does not allege how the Respondent has treated its own nationals (or nationals of any other State) more favourably than the Claimant. Accordingly, the Respondent submits that these unsubstantiated claims should be dismissed by the Tribunal under CAFTA Article 10.20.4.\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent next objects to the Claimant\u2019s allegation of a breach by the Respondent of CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B) with regard to alleged \"investment authorizations\", where the Claimant asserts that the Respondent \"has breached the express and implied terms of the Enterprises\u2019 investment authorizations, including, without limitation, all resolutions issued by MINEC in relation to the investments in El Salvador.\"\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent submits that CAFTA defines an \"investment authorization\" as \"an authorization that the foreign investment authority of a Party grants to a covered investment or an investor of another Party.\"\n\n170.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the resolutions by the *Oficina Nacional de Inversiones* (ONI) registering the investments in El Salvador are not \"authorizations\" but \"registrations\" of investments. The Claimant\u2019s Enterprises requested such registration after the funds being registered had already been transferred to El Salvador; and there is thus no investment authorization from the Respondent that can form the basis for a CAFTA claim by the Claimant.\n\n171.\n\nIn any event, according to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s general reference to alleged investment authorizations is insufficient for a CAFTA claim. CAFTA Article 10.16.2(b) requires that the notice of intent \"shall specify... the provision of this Agreement, investment authorization, or investment agreement alleged to have been breached.\" The Claimant does no more than refer generally to \"all resolutions issued by MINEC.\" The Respondent submits that, because there is no investment authorization (much less one with enforceable provisions) and there is no reference to alleged breaches to the provisions of any resolution, there is no viable claim under CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B).\n\n172.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent submits that these other CAFTA claims should be dismissed by the Tribunal under CAFTA Article 10.20.4.\n\n173.\n\n***Non-CAFTA Claims:*** The Respondent objects to the competence of the Tribunal over all claims under the Investment Law. The exclusivity requirement in CAFTA, which precludes the Claimant from initiating any non-CAFTA proceeding involving the same measures alleged to constitute a breach of CAFTA, bars the competence of the Tribunal for all claims made by Claimant under the Investment Law and any other domestic laws of the Respondent. The Respondent here also relies upon the expert opinion of Professor Reisman.\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent submits that CAFTA requires exclusivity of arbitration proceedings with regard to any measures alleged to constitute a breach of CAFTA. This exclusivity requirement is included in CAFTA Article 10.18. The scope of this exclusivity requirement extends beyond the typical \"fork-in-the-road\u2019 provisions in many bilateral investment treaties. CAFTA requires exclusivity of the CAFTA dispute settlement provisions with respect to any claims related to the same measures alleged to constitute violations of CAFTA.\n\n175.\n\nThe Respondent contends that NAFTA Article 1121 has waiver requirements similar to CAFTA\u2019s requirements. These waiver requirements have also been invoked by respondents with regard to local judicial and local arbitration proceedings, with the resulting dismissal of claims, either voluntarily or by order of the tribunal. For example, in the first NAFTA arbitration between *Waste Management Inc. and Mexico*, the claimant was attempting to maintain two domestic judicial proceedings and one domestic arbitration proceeding based on the same measures which the claimant was alleging constituted a violation of NAFTA in the NAFTA arbitration. The claimant argued that it was allowed to keep the concurrent proceedings because they were based on other sources of law, *i.e*., Mexican law and not the NAFTA provisions upon which the claims in the NAFTA arbitration were based. The tribunal rejected the claimant\u2019s interpretation of the waiver requirement because the measures being challenged in the concurrent proceedings were also the basis for the NAFTA claims in the NAFTA arbitration.\n\n176.\n\nUntil now, according to the Respondent, arbitral decisions and awards involving waivers under CAFTA and the similarly-worded waivers under NAFTA have only decided challenges involving parallel domestic proceedings based on the same measures that were alleged to constitute a breach of CAFTA or NAFTA in the nondomestic international arbitration. This was only so because that was the particular issue presented in these cases. According to the Respondent, there is nothing in the plain text of CAFTA Article 10.18.2(b) to limit its application to domestic proceedings.\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent cites, as an example, the first CAFTA arbitration, *TCW Group Inc and Dominican Energy Holdings, LP v. The Dominican Republic,* where the respondent made a jurisdictional objection based on the impermissible existence of two parallel international arbitrations in addition to the CAFTA arbitration, one alleging breaches of a BIT and one alleging violations of a contract but based on the same measures also alleged to constitute a breach of CAFTA in the CAFTA arbitration. The claimants disputed the requirement of identity of claimants in the parallel international arbitration which was necessary to trigger the waiver provisions, but the claimants never alleged that the waiver required by CAFTA Article 10.18.2(b) applied to domestic proceedings only. Thus, if this arbitration had not been terminated by the parties\u2019 settlement, the tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction (regardless of its ruling on the claimants\u2019 identity argument) would have involved the application of the requirement of CAFTA Article 10.18.2(b) and the invocation of the corresponding waiver with regard to parallel international arbitrations.\n\n178.\n\nTherefore, according to the Respondent, any notion that the waiver requirement applies only to parallel domestic proceedings is contradicted by the plain text of the treaty, the plain text of the waiver and the previous invocation of a waiver under CAFTA in a situation involving parallel international arbitrations.\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent submits that these earlier NAFTA and CAFTA cases regarding exclusivity requirements and waivers lead to the conclusion that the Claimant cannot initiate parallel proceedings in domestic courts, in domestic arbitration proceedings or in another international arbitration (even in a separate ICSID arbitration) invoking jurisdiction under the Investment Law to bring claims under the Investment law (or other Salvadoran laws) based on the same measures alleged to constitute a violation of CAFTA before this Tribunal in these ICSID arbitration proceedings.\n\n180.\n\nIn the present arbitration, so the Respondent submits, the Claimant is bringing before this ICSID Tribunal two separate proceedings, one under CAFTA and the second one under the Investment Law. If allowed to proceed, the Claimant would be asserting two quite different sets of claims with regard to the exact same measures.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant cannot do in a single arbitration what it is not allowed to do in two separate arbitrations. Such a result would force the Respondent effectively to defend itself against two proceedings relating to precisely the same measures, with the possibility of inconsistent results because of different legal standards and different jurisdictional requirements. This is not allowed by the plain text of CAFTA Article 10.18.2(b), which was a condition to the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration when the Respondent became a party to CAFTA, as well as when the Claimant executed its waivers and commenced arbitration under CAFTA; and it remains a condition to the Respondent\u2019s consent.\n\n182.\n\nThe Respondent notes that several tribunals, parties to arbitration proceedings and commentators have raised the possibility of double recovery of damages as the purpose behind the waiver provisions in both NAFTA and CAFTA. The Respondent does not share that narrow interpretation, because there are other ways to address the issue of double recovery, as the claimant in *TCW v. The Dominican Republic* suggested. Instead, the Respondent focuses its objection on the plain text of CAFTA and the double jeopardy to which it would be subject in this case if CAFTA Article 10.18.2(b) did not provide otherwise.\n\n183.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant expressly accepted that the following waiver required by CAFTA was a precondition to the Parties\u2019 consent to jurisdiction under CAFTA:\n\n*\u2014Pursuant to Articles 10.18(2)(b)(i) and 10.18(2)(b)(ii) of CAFTA, PRC waives its right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party to CAFTA, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure* *alleged in PRC\u2018s Notice of Arbitration, dated April 30, 2009, to* *constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16 of CAFTA.*\n\n184.\n\nIn addition, according to the Respondent, the Claimant expressly consented to submit itself to CAFTA procedures earlier in that same document: *\"Pursuant to Article 10.18(2)(a) of the Central America \u2014 United States \u2014 Dominican Republic Free* *Trade Agreement (\u2014CAFTA \"), Pac Rim Cayman LLC (\"PRC \") hereby consents to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in CAFTA*.\" According to the Respondent, the Claimant has unequivocally waived its rights to initiate or continue *\"any* proceeding with respect to any measure alleged in PRC\u2019s Notice of Arbitration... to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16 of CAFTA\" (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent submits that all claims under the Investment Law pleaded in the Notice of Arbitration are based on the exact same measures which the Claimant alleges to be breaches of CAFTA, namely: the Claimant\u2019s allegations that the Respondent failed to grant a mining exploitation concession for El Dorado, and that the Respondent failed to issue Environmental Permits necessary for the renewal of the exploration licenses for the Guaco, Huacuco, and Pueblo. In fact, the Claimant addresses the factual basis for both the CAFTA and the Investment Law proceedings in a single section of the Notice of Arbitration, using the same measures as the factual basis for all claims in the two sets of legal claims. Therefore, according to the Respondent, there is an impermissible identity of measures in the two sets of legal claims advanced by the Claimant before this Tribunal.\n\n186.\n\nHaving waived its rights to initiate or continue any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach of CAFTA, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has acted inconsistently with the terms of its waiver when it simultaneously invoked jurisdiction and introduced claims under the Investment Law over the same measures which the Claimant alleges are breaches of CAFTA.\n\n187.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, previous CAFTA and NAFTA cases involving improper waivers with regard to pending parallel proceedings have resulted in the dismissal of the CAFTA or NAFTA claims affected by the overlapping measures. That remedy was appropriate in those cases because the tribunal deciding the objection only had the power to dismiss the claims before that tribunal, and did not have the power to terminate the concurrent proceedings. That remedy also was appropriate because that was what the respondent requested or agreed to.\n\n188.\n\nIn this case, however, the Respondent contends that this Tribunal has before it both sets of claims; and that it therefore has the power to dismiss the second set of claims. In this situation, according to the Respondent, the proper remedy for this Tribunal is to enforce the Claimant\u2019s waiver under CAFTA and to dismiss all non-CAFTA claims. This would resolve the problem, as identified by the Respondent, created by the contradiction between the Claimant\u2019s waiver and its Notice of Arbitration.\n\n189.\n\nIn conclusion, pursuant to CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5, the Respondent submits that it has demonstrated that the Claimant\u2019s allegations of fact (if taken as true) and the undisputed facts show that PRES has failed to meet the requirements to obtain a mining exploitation concession in El Dorado; and that the Claimant has no valid legal claims regarding the Santa Rita exploration license. Therefore, the Claimant is not entitled to any award regarding these claims because the Respondent\u2019s alleged conduct has not caused any legal harm to the Claimant. In addition, the Claimant has not made any factual allegations to substantiate its legal allegations regarding breaches by the Respondent of CAFTA Articles 10.3 (National Treatment), 10.4 (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment), and 10.16.1(b)(i)(B). Consequently, the Respondent submits that these claims should be dismissed. Lastly, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal does not have any competence in these arbitration proceedings to decide any of the Claimant\u2019s claims under the Investment Law (or any other domestic law of the Respondent).\n\n***C: The Claimant's Case***\n----------------------------\n\n190.\n\nIt is similarly appropriate for the Tribunal to summarise here the Claimant\u2019s responses to the Preliminary Objections. As with the Respondent\u2019s case, this summary is necessarily incomplete; and in tracking the Claimant\u2019s own submissions, it should not be thought that this summary represents the views of the Tribunal.\n\n191.\n\n***The El Dorado Claim*** : According to the Claimant, the Respondent erroneously asserts that PRES did not meet the two necessary requirements under the Mining Law for submitting an application for an exploitation concession from the Respondent. The Claimant submits that (i) PRES did demonstrate that it owned or was authorized to use the property where the El Dorado mine is to be located; and (ii) PRES did submit a proper Feasibility Study. The Claimant submits that these are issues of fact, both (a) as to what did or did not happen and (b) as to Salvadoran law, being treated as facts under international law before this Tribunal.\n\n192.\n\n*The Property Issue:* As to the property issue, the Claimant submits that it must be assumed for present purposes that PRES did not fail to comply with Article 37 of the Mining Law concerning the documentary requirement for demonstrating ownership or authority to use the relevant land. The Claimant specifically pleaded in its Notice of Arbitration that PRES complied with this specific requirement of the Mining Law; see particularly paragraphs 35 and 42 of the Notice of Arbitration (quoted above in Part IV). According to the Claimant, this factual allegation, being assumed to be true under CAFTA Article 10.20.4(c) should, for present purposes, suffice to defeat the Respondent\u2019s Objection.\n\n193.\n\nIn any event, so the Claimant submits, the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Salvadoran law is wrong. It is not the case that PRES was required to provide MINEC with proof of ownership or authorization comprising the entire surface area requested for the El Dorado concession. Article 37 of the Mining Law does not require the applicant to provide ownership of or authorization to use the entire surface of the concession area. The requirement is limited to the property within the concession area where mining activities are to be conducted, or, as pleaded in the Notice of Arbitration, \"where the mine project is located.\" (Paragraph 35: quoted above in Part IV).\n\n194.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it is important to bear in mind that the mining concession sought by PRES was for an underground mine and not an open pit mine. It is a general principle of Salvadoran law that the sub-surface (with all mineral deposits thereof) is the property of the State and not of individual landowners. As stated in Article 103 of the Respondent\u2019s Constitution: \"The subsurface belongs to the State, which may grant concessions for its exploitation.\"\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimant submits that this general principle is reflected in several provisions of the Mining Law. These provisions, read with Article 37, make it clear that, for an underground mine, the applicant need only demonstrate ownership or authorization of the limited surface area where mining activities are actually to be conducted, *i.e.* where the entrance to the underground mine and the above-ground mining facilities are to be physically located on the surface. The ownership of or authorization to use other surface areas under which minerals may be located (but which surface area is not to be used, disturbed or impacted by the applicant) is clearly not required by Article 37 of the Mining Law.\n\n196.\n\nThus, according to the Claimant, Article 2 of the Mining Law provides that \"the State is the owner of all mineral deposits existing in the subsoil of the territory of the Republic, irrespective of their origin, form and physical state.\" Article 10 establishes that mineral deposits existing in the subsoil constitute property distinct from the surface land under which they are located. Article 21 provides that authorization from third party landowners is required only for works to be performed on the soil surface. Article 54 provides that beneficiaries of mining rights can obtain a legal easement if use of real property owned by a third party is necessary for the development of their mining activities.\n\n197.\n\nAll these provisions confirm, in the Claimant\u2019s submission, that ownership or authorization to use all of the surface area comprising a concession area for an underground mine is not necessary under Article 37 of the Mining Law.\n\n198.\n\nMoreover, so the Claimant contends, it would make no practical sense for the applicant to be required to obtain ownership of or authorization to use the surface land from private land-owners located above the deposit, but which surface land the applicant does not intend to use or disturb in order to mine the sub-surface. Article 37 only requires property ownership or authorization for works to be performed on the soil surface - not for the surface area overlaying underground deposits that will not be affected by the applicant\u2019s mining activities.\n\n199.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant submits that Respondent\u2019s case that PRES did not comply with this first requirement of Article 37 of the Mining Law in making its application for an exploitation concession is based on an incomplete, inaccurate and misleading presentation of the relevant facts, including facts concerning Salvadoran law and the relevant administrative record.\n\n200.\n\n*Feasibility Study:* As to this issue, the Claimant submits that, as a matter of fact, PRES complied with Article 37 of the Mining Law because PRES did submit a Feasibility Study. Similarly to the first issue above, the Claimant contends that its factual allegation to such effect pleaded in paragraphs 35 and 42ff of the Notice of Arbitration (cited above in Part IV), being assumed to be true under CAFTA Article 10.20.4(c), should suffice to defeat the Respondent\u2019s Objection without more.\n\n201.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant contends that PRES submitted a Feasibility Study in the form of a \"Preliminary Pre-Feasibility Study\" with its application for the exploitation concession in December 2004, followed by a \"Final Pre-Feasibility Study\" in January 2005.\n\n202.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s submission that this \"Final Pre-Feasibility Study\" did not comply with the requirements of Article 37 of the Mining Law. The Respondent wrongly alleges that the difference between a Pre-Feasibility Study and a Feasibility Study is not merely a difference in name but a difference in substance. In fact, according to the Claimant, the Respondent has (*inter alia*) confused terms that have a meaningful distinction in the context of U.S. and Canadian securities laws, but which have no significance in the context of an application for an exploitation concession to the Respondent under the Mining Law of El Salvador.\n\n203.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Article 37 of the Mining Law requires an exploitation concession applicant to submit an \" *Estudio de Factibilidad T\u00e9cnico Econ\u00f3mico, elaborado por professionales afines a la materia\"* - *i.e.* a Study of Technical and Economic Feasibility, prepared by professional persons with expertise in the relevant field. In the Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant provided a \"shorthand\" definition to refer to this document: a \"Feasibility Study.\"\n\n204.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Mining Law and Mining Regulations set out the requirements for what is to be included in a Feasibility Study. Article 23 of the Mining Law (\"Concession for the Exploitation of Mines\") provides that an application for a mining concession is made upon completion of exploration and proof of the \"existence of economic mining potential on the authorised area; and Article 23 also refers to \"verification of economic potential.\"\n\n205.\n\nSection 18 of the Mining Regulations (\"Application for Exploitation Concessions\") provides that when: \"applying for a Mine Exploitation Concession after receiving an Exploration License, proof of the existence of a deposit or deposits as described in Article 23 of the Law shall be provided via documents that are congruent or consistent with the activities and studies that were executed during the term of this License, and the final report described in the preceding section... when the concession is requested directly, as set forth in Section 23, paragraph 3, of the Law, documentation shall be based on information on expired mining rights or from Technical Studies carried out that indicate the existence of minerals.\"\n\n206.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent itself confirms that the *Estudio de Factibilidad T\u00e9cnico Econ\u00f3mico* is intended to serve this limited purpose. Specifically, the Respondent refers to the purpose of this study as \"allow[ing] the Ministry of Economy to properly evaluate whether to grant the concession and, if so, whether PRES had provided justification and showed its technical and economic capacity, for the 12.75 square kilometres area it was requesting for the exploitation concession\" (Paragraph 80 of its Preliminary Objections).\n\n207.\n\nBy these terms, according to the Claimant, the Final Pre-Feasibility Study submitted by PRES plainly met or exceeded the requirements of the *Estudio de Factibilidad T\u00e9cnico Econ\u00f3mico*. It is a professional report, exceeding 200 pages and prepared by numerous specialist firms under the coordination of SRK Consulting, one of the leading independent producers of feasibility studies in the mining world.\n\n208.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Mining Law and Regulations do not define a \"mineable deposit.\" In preparing the study, SRK therefore used the definitions employed by the Canadian Institute of Mining, being consistent with the purpose of Salvadoran law described above.\n\n209.\n\nThus, as used in the study, a \"mineral resource\" is defined as a resource \"in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction; and a \"mineral reserve\" means \"the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.\" The study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that \"economic extraction can be justified.\"\n\n210.\n\nConsistent with these requirements, according to the Claimant, the Pre-Feasibility Study submitted by PRES included a \"Statement of Mineral Reserves,\" totalling 535,586 gold equivalent ounces; and this conclusion alone is sufficient to show that an economically mineable deposit exists, even after taking into account the proposed mining method; metallurgical and processing methods; and other economic, legal, environmental, and other relevant factors which are discussed in detail throughout the study.\n\n211.\n\nTherefore, the Claimant submits that the study submitted by PRES plainly satisfies both the letter and intent of Article 37(2)(d) of the Mining Law.\n\n212.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent confuses the standards for an *Estudio de Factibilidad T\u00e9cnico Econ\u00f3mico* under the Mining Law with those under the U.S. and Canadian securities laws for publicly traded mining companies. Again, under the mining regulatory framework in El Salvador (and most other countries), the purpose for a feasibility study is to show that there is a sufficient existence of economic mining potential in the authorized area as to justify exploitation activities. By contrast, in the context of the U.S. and Canadian securities laws, the purpose of such studies is to inform potential investors of how developed the financial model is for the intended mine. Under these securities laws, guided by industry standards used to construe these laws, a \"pre-feasibility study\" must provide a degree of economic reliability that is within a range of 20% to 30%. The economic reliability of a feasibility study should be within 15%.\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it is therefore difficult (if not impossible) to prepare a study with the level of economic reliability required under that standard for a \"feasibility study\" *before* an environmental permit and an exploitation concession have been issued. The timing alone of the permit and concession could affect, for example, the costs of various commodities used to gauge the likely financial performance of a mining project. As stated in PRES\u2019s application: \"The studies related to a mining project are largely iterative and change according to the costs, metal prices, operating upgrades, available technology and exploration program results.\"\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the fact that PRES could not label the report a \"Final Feasibility Study\" (because of U.S. and Canadian securities laws) does not mean that the \"Final Pre-Feasibility Study\" did not satisfy the requirements of the Mining Law. The US and Canadian requirements are higher, not lower, than the requirements under Article 37 of the Mining Law of El Salvador.\n\n215.\n\nLastly, so the Claimant concludes, even assuming that MINEC believed that there were any deficiencies with respect to PRES\u2019 Feasibility Study, MINEC was required actually to inform PRES and allow it to cure any such deficiencies under Salvadoran law. After that process, to the extent that PRES disagreed with MINEC\u2019s conclusions and MINEC still denied the application, PRES would have been entitled to pursue an appeal through the appellate process also provided for by Salvadoran law. MINEC never ruled one way or the other, thereby effectively destroying the Claimant\u2019s investment and leaving the Claimant without any recourse to any of the procedural or substantive protections that Salvadoran law could provide against an adverse ruling.\n\n216.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant contends that the Respondent\u2019s submission that PRES did not comply with this second requirement of Article 37 of the Mining Law, in making its application for an exploitation concession, should be rejected by the Tribunal both under Article 10.20.4(c) and in any event.\n\n217.\n\n***Santa Rita Claim:*** The Claimant submits that the Respondent overlooks the principal allegations of the Claimant\u2019s claim, namely: that long before PRES decided not to renew its Santa Rita exploration license in July 2009, the Respondent had destroyed the investment that the Claimant had made by making it clear that, no matter what applications the Claimant filed or what the Claimant did, PRES would not be allowed by the Respondent to mine at Santa Rita or elsewhere.\n\n218.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, under CAFTA and international law generally, an investor does not have to continue formal compliance with a regulatory regime that the respondent government has effectively swept away in order to maintain a claim by the investor under CAFTA. The Claimant cites the arbitration awards in *Glamis Gold v. USA* and *Vivendi v. Argentina* : \"[I]nternational and domestic courts do not require futile attempts that will merely waste a claimant\u2019s resources and fail to change an inevitable final decision\" by the host State (*Glamis Gold Ltd. v. USA,* Award of 14 May 2009, paragraph 333; and *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal SA v. Republic of Argentina*, Award of 20 August 2007, paragraph 7.5.28); and accordingly a claimant is under no obligation to continue operations after the treaty obligation invoked by the investor has already been breached by the host State.\n\n219.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant concludes that, by the Respondent\u2019s illegal acts and omissions, the Respondent made it impossible for the Claimant as an investor to pursue its mining activities anywhere in the country, including Santa Rita; and that the Objection to the Santa Rita Claim should therefore be dismissed by the Tribunal.\n\n220.\n\n***Other CAFTA Claims*** : The Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Claimant has failed to provide any factual basis for its claims of violation of CAFTA Articles 10.3 (National Treatment) and 10.4 (Most-Favored Nation Treatment). According to the Claimant, the Respondent also asserts wrongly that the Claimant does not allege in the Notice of Arbitration how the Respondent has treated its own nationals (or nationals of any other State) more favourably than the Claimant.\n\n221.\n\nContrary to the Respondent\u2019s assertions, the Claimant submits that it pleaded the relevant legal and factual bases for its claims in its Notice of Intent. It there alleged: \"The Salvadoran Government\u2019s discriminatory behaviour toward the Enterprises is also reflected by the fact that other industries whose operations raise similar environmental concerns, such as power plants, dams, ports, and fishing operations, have received environmental permits during the same timeframe that the Enterprises\u2019 applications have been pending. By, *inter alia*, refusing to grant the environmental permits to PRES and DOREX while issuing those permits to other companies, El Salvador has denied to PRC the same treatment that it is required to afford, and has afforded, to investments of its own nationals and to nationals of other states.\" (Paragraph 35 of the Notice of Intent).\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimant contends that this pleading in the Notice of Intent was both sufficient and also effectively summarised in the Notice of Arbitration (paragraph 91); and that it should now be treated by the Tribunal as incorporated into the Notice of Arbitration either by its original wording or under the Claimant\u2019s request to amend the Notice of Arbitration to such effect. As to the latter, as already indicated, the Tribunal is content to do so: see Part I above, at paragraph 35.\n\n223.\n\nMoreover, according to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s effective ban on mining activities appears to be limited to metallic mining. In the meantime, non-metallic exploitation activities (which are conducted primarily by Salvadoran companies) continue unhindered. These contrasting facts provide further support for the Claimant\u2019s National Treatment and Most-Favoured-Nation (\"MFN\") Treatment claims in these arbitration proceedings.\n\n224.\n\nIn support of its case, *inter alia*, the Claimant cites the arbitral decisions in *Corn Products International, Inc. v. Mexico*, where a NAFTA tribunal set forth the similar requirements for demonstrating a breach of National Treatment (which are said to be equally applicable to MFN Treatment under CAFTA).\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent has therefore failed to meet its burden of showing that Claimant\u2019s National Treatment and MFN Treatment claims are, as a matter of law, not claims for which an award in favour of the Claimant may be made; and accordingly its Objection should be dismissed by the Tribunal.\n\n226.\n\nAs regards investment authorizations, the Claimant submits that it alleged in the Notice of Arbitration that the Respondent had breached CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B) and, specifically, that MINEC had issued \"investment authorizations\" in the form of (i) resolutions granting exploration licenses to PRC\u2019s Enterprises and (ii) resolutions from ONI authorizing the registration of PRC\u2019s investment in El Salvador.\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the Respondent advances two separate arguments directed at the Claimant\u2019s claims arising from its investment authorizations. First, the Respondent wrongly submits that the Claimant has not identified the resolutions at issue with the requisite specificity in its Notice of arbitration. According to the Claimant, the Respondent is well aware of what resolutions MINEC issued to the Enterprises. Moreover, elsewhere in the Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant identified the resolutions with great specificity and included several as exhibits. According to the Claimant, this argument is simply wrong at the early stage of these ICSID arbitration proceedings.\n\n228.\n\nSecond, according to the Claimant, the Respondent is wrong to submit that the resolutions granting exploration licenses and registering the Claimant\u2019s investments do not constitute \"investment authorizations\" within the meaning of CAFTA Article 10.28.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimant contends that CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a)(i) sets out three different types of instruments, the obligations of which can form the basis for a claim under CAFTA (see the full text cited above in Part III).\n\n230.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the second instrument, an \"investment authorization\", was meant to capture those cases where a State authorizes an investor to make investments within the State\u2019s territory, but not through an investment agreement (being the third instrument). The concept is that where, as in this case, the State has invited an investor of a Party to invest in the State through an investment authorization and has conferred rights on the investor in exchange for its investment, those rights should be enforceable under CAFTA.\n\n231.\n\nArticle 10.28 of CAFTA defines an \"investment authorization\" as \"an authorization that the foreign investment authority of a Party grants to a covered investment or an investor of another Party.\" Article 10.28 further defines an \"investment\" as including \"licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar rights conferred pursuant to domestic law.\"\n\n232.\n\nA footnote to this definition states: \"Whether a particular type of license, authorization, permit, or similar instrument (including a concession, to the extent that it has the nature of such an instrument) has the characteristics of an investment depends on such factors as the nature and extent of the rights that the holder has under the law of the Party. Among the licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar instruments that do not have the characteristics of an investment are those that do not create any rights protected under domestic law. For greater certainty, the foregoing is without prejudice to whether any asset associated with the license, authorization, permit or similar instrument has the characteristics of an investment.\"\n\n233.\n\nAs alleged by the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration, the exploration licenses at issue conveyed substantial rights under Salvadoran law, including (specifically) the exclusive right to pursue an exploitation concession free from extra-legal changes to the regulatory framework. The resolutions at issue authorized licenses, which constituted covered investments under CAFTA. Hence, these resolutions and the licenses granted by them are \"investment authorizations\" under CAFTA.\n\n234.\n\nThe Claimant submits that there is also no question that these resolutions were in fact issued by the \"foreign investment authority of a Party\" because MINEC is the authority under Salvadoran law charged with responsibility over foreign investment by the Respondent.\n\n235.\n\nSimilarly, according to the Claimant, by registering these investments with ONI, a department of MINEC, the Enterprises received investment authorizations from MINEC and the Respondent. Article 17 of the Investment Law specifically requires that foreign investors \"must register their investments at the ONI, which shall issue a Credential (\" *una Credencial* \") granting the foreign investor status and identifying the registered investment.\"A foreign investor whose investment registrations are accepted at ONI are deemed authorized to do business in El Salvador and to enjoy all the rights and protections of the Investment Law. Article 26 of the Investment Law provides that \"[e]xisting foreign investment registered at the Ministry of Economy are recognized and their validity accepted, as long as they remain in good standing, for which they will automatically be afforded the guarantees and rights stipulated by this law, except on the subject of disputes arising before enforcement of this law.\"\n\n236.\n\nThus, the Claimant submits that the resolutions issued by ONI authorizing the registration of the Claimant\u2019s investments in El Salvador unambiguously constitute investment authorizations under CAFTA.\n\n237.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant concludes that its review of the text of CAFTA and relevant materials (including the Investment Law) demonstrates that the Respondent\u2019s second argument is devoid of any merit. The resolutions issued by ONI authorizing the capital invested by the Claimant in El Salvador and the resolutions issued by MINEC allowing PRES to develop exploration activities in that country, constitute \"investment authorizations\" under CAFTA Article 10.16(1)(a)(i)(B).\n\n238.\n\nHowever, according to the Claimant, that is not even the question currently before the Tribunal under the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections: the question is whether the Respondent has met the burden of demonstrating that the Claimant\u2019s claims with respect to investment authorizations are, as a matter of law, claims for which an award in favour of the Claimant may not be granted under CAFTA Article 10.26. The Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to meet that burden; and its Objection should therefore be rejected by the Tribunal.\n\n239.\n\n***Non-CAFTA Claims:*** Next, as to the Respondent\u2019s Objection under Article 10.20.5 as to the Tribunal\u2019s competence, the Claimant contends that by ratifying CAFTA and enacting the Investment Law, the Respondent provided its consent to arbitrate claims under both CAFTA and the Investment Law before this Tribunal; by submitting its Notice of Arbitration asserting claims under both CAFTA and the Investment Law, the Claimant has provided its reciprocal consent to arbitrate such claims before this Tribunal; and the Claimant has not waived, nor been required to waive, its right to arbitrate such claims under both CAFTA and the Investment Law before this Tribunal in these arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Convention. The Claimant here also relies on the expert opinion of Professor Wallace.\n\n240.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s argument to the contrary springs from its own interpretation of CAFTA Article 10.18.2. It necessarily requires the phrase \"or other dispute settlement procedures\" in the concluding sub-paragraph to apply to that part of these proceedings by which the Claimant advances its claims under the Investment Law. That is not a permissible reading of this provision under international law, nor an appropriate characterisation of these ICSID proceedings.\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimant submits that there is no risk of double jeopardy to the Respondent, given that the Claimant advances all its claims at the same time within the same ICSID arbitration before the same Tribunal. There can be no unfair prejudice to the Respondent from such proceedings; nor any corresponding unfair advantage to the Claimant. If there were, the Tribunal has available powers to apply any remedy later in these proceedings, without declaring itself incompetent at this early stage of these proceedings.\n\n242.\n\nNor is it unusual, still less unacceptable, so the Claimant contends, for an arbitral tribunal to enjoy concurrent jurisdiction under a treaty and a municipal investment or other law. The Claimant cites as recent examples the ICSID awards in *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan* (2008) and *Duke v. Ecuador* (2008).\n\n243.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s case that this Tribunal lacks competence under CAFTA Article 10.20.5 should be rejected by the Tribunal.\n\n***D: The Tribunal's Decisions***\n---------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s decisions below and its concern not to prejudge, or even be seen to prejudge, the Parties\u2019 respective cases hereon in these arbitration proceedings, it is necessary for the Tribunal to state the grounds for its decisions as succinctly as possible.\n\n245.\n\n***The El Dorado Claim:*** This claim is the largest and most significant claim made by the Claimant. On the alleged facts in the Notice of Arbitration, cited in Part IV of this decision, the Tribunal does not consider that the Respondent has demonstrated that this claim, as a matter of law, is not a claim for which an award in favour of the Claimant may be made under CAFTA Article 10.26.\n\n246.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the issue of liability raises questions as to the interpretation and application of the Mining Law (whether treated as fact or law) which are either to be assumed to be true for present purposes or which cannot at present be decided finally in favour of the Respondent; and the issue of causation (assuming liability) raises questions of fact or mixed law and fact which cannot at present be decided finally in favour of the Respondent. As regards the issue of damages (assuming liability and causation), the Tribunal considers that it may be possible for such damages to be quantified as compensation for the loss of a chance even if (which the Tribunal does not here decide) such damages could not be characterised as compensation for the loss of an \"automatic\" or \"perfected\" right to a mining exploitation concession; and thus, if this were so, that issue too cannot at present be decided finally in favour of the Respondent.\n\n247.\n\n***The Santa Rita Claim:*** This is a relatively small claim, which appears to contribute little additional burden to the Respondent in defending these proceedings. Notwithstanding this claim\u2019s terse pleading in the Notice of Arbitration, on balance, the Tribunal considers it inappropriate to accept the Respondent\u2019s Objection under CAFTA Article 10.20.4 given this claim\u2019s adjectival and minor status.\n\n248.\n\n***Other CAFTA Claims:*** As regards the claims under CAFTA Articles 10.3 and 10.4, given the Notice of Arbitration and the Claimant\u2019s request to amend the Notice of Arbitration, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not established that these claims are insufficiently pleaded or that these claims, as a matter of law, are not claims for which an award in favour of the Claimant may not be made under CAFTA Article 10.26.\n\n249.\n\nAs regards the claims based on the alleged investment authorizations, the Tribunal considers that these claims raise issues of Salvadoran law which (whether treated as fact or law) cannot be decided finally at this stage in favour of the Respondent; and accordingly, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent\u2019s Objection under CAFTA Article 10.20.4.\n\n250.\n\n***Non-CAFTA Claims:*** The Tribunal does not accept the Respondent\u2019s Objection as to its lack of competence under CAFTA Article 10.20.5.\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the expert opinions of Professor Reisman and Professor Wallace. It has not found it necessary to decide the broader issues canvassed in these two opinions, which are best left to other tribunals in other cases. In this case, the Tribunal considers that the decisive issue is relatively short.\n\n252.\n\nGiven CAFTA\u2019s stated objective in providing an effective procedure for dispute resolution and the important practical need, wherever possible, for \"one stop adjudication\u2019, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of CAFTA Article 10.18(2) and its treatment of these ICSID proceedings as comprising two quite separate \"dispute settlement procedures.\"\n\n253.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, these arbitration proceedings are indivisible, being the same single ICSID arbitration between the same Parties before the same Tribunal in receipt of the same Notice of Arbitration registered once by the ICSID Acting Secretary-General under the ICSID Convention. To decide otherwise would require an interpretation of CAFTA Article 10.18(2) wholly at odds with its object and purpose and potentially resulting in gross unfairness to a claimant. There is no corresponding unfairness to the Respondent in maintaining these ICSID proceedings as one single arbitration. In particular, the Respondent does not here face any practical risk of double jeopardy. Lastly, it is hardly a legitimate objection to this Tribunal\u2019s competence that it exercises jurisdiction over these Parties based not upon one consent to such jurisdiction from the Respondent but based upon two cumulative consents from the Respondent. It is an indisputable historical fact that several arbitration tribunals have exercised jurisdiction based on more than one consent from one disputant party, without being thereby deprived of jurisdiction.\n\n254.\n\nAccordingly, for all these reasons, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections.\n\n***PART VII: THE TRIBUNAL'S SUMMARY***\n--------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nAs indicated above, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5.\n\n256.\n\nIn regard to each of the Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20.4, as also indicated above, the Tribunal is legally obliged to assume that the Claimant\u2019s factual allegations pleaded in the Notice of Arbitration, albeit disputed by the Respondent, are \"true\" in accordance with the express requirements of CAFTA Article 10.20.4(c) for the purpose of deciding these objections. Conversely, it is not permissible for the Tribunal to negate this assumption by constructing to contrary effect \"relevant facts not in dispute\" from other materials for the purpose of the last sentence of Article 10.20.4(c), when it is clear that such facts, as invoked by the Respondent, are disputed by the Claimant.\n\n257.\n\nThat assumption of truthfulness, as explained above, is made by the Tribunal for the limited purpose of this Decision only. It does not represent or reflect any other decision by the Tribunal itself as to the truth or falsity of any of the factual allegations pleaded by the Claimant and denied by the Respondent.\n\n258.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal does not here grant the preliminary relief claimed by the Respondent set out above in Part I, at paragraph 54(2) to (5) and paragraph 55(1) to (6).\n\n***PART VIII: COSTS***\n----------------------\n\n259.\n\n***Introduction:*** There still remain the disputed issues of costs to be decided by the Tribunal, as claimed by both Parties respectively.\n\n260.\n\n***The Claimant:*** The Claimant requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to bear all the costs and expenses of this Preliminary Objections\u2019 phase. The Claimant submits that its costs should be reimbursed because it has been forced to defend itself against \"frivolous\" Preliminary Objections made by the Respondent, within the meaning of CAFTA Article 10.20.6.\n\n261.\n\n***The Respondent*** : The Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the Claimant to bear all the costs and expenses of this Preliminary Objections\u2019 phase, including the Tribunal\u2019s expenses, the Respondent\u2019s costs for legal representation, with interest. The Respondent submits in turn that its costs should be reimbursed because it has been forced to defend itself against \"frivolous\" claims made by the Claimant, also within the meaning of CAFTA Article 10.20.6: see also its claimed preliminary relief set out in Part I above at paragraphs 54(6) and 55(6).\n\n262.\n\n***The Tribunal's Decision:*** Given the Tribunal\u2019s decision not to accept the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, it must follow that the Respondent\u2019s application for costs must be rejected. It does not follow, however, that the Claimant\u2019s application for costs should here be allowed, for two reasons.\n\n263.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal is conscious that this was the first application made under CAFTA Article 10.20.4 and also the first time that the expedited procedure under Article 10.20.5 was invoked for a preliminary objection under Article 10.20.4. There was thus something to be learnt for all involved; and what might seem inappropriate after that lesson would not have seemed so beforehand, at the time when it mattered. In any event, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections cannot be regarded, even now, as \"frivolous\" within the meaning of CAFTA Article 10.20.6.\n\n264.\n\nSecond, as regards these particular claims, much of the costs so far incurred by the Parties will not have been wasted. Much of the work required to bring these proceedings forwards to a conclusion has now been done. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is unlikely that much time, effort and expenditure will have been lost overall.\n\n265.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal decides to make no order as to costs at this stage under CAFTA Article 10.20.6 but to reserve its decision to the final stage of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n***PART IX: THE OPERATIVE PART***\n---------------------------------\n\n266.\n\n**For the reasons and on the grounds set out above, the Tribunal decides:**\n\n**(1) As to the Respondent's Preliminary Objections under CAFTA Article 10.20.4, these objections are not granted by the Tribunal;**\n\n**(2) As to the Respondent's Objection under CAFTA Article 10.20.5, this objection is not granted by the Tribunal;**\n\n**(3) As to costs, the Tribunal here makes no order under CAFTA Article 10.20.6, whilst reserving all its powers as to orders for costs at the final stage of these arbitration proceedings; and**\n\n**(4) As to all other matters, the Tribunal retains its full powers to decide any further matters in these arbitration proceedings, whether by order, decision or award.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2012-06-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Glossary of Defined Terms***\n-------------------------------\n\n\"*CAFTA*\" means the Dominican Republic - Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement of 2004;\n\n\"*DOREX*\" means Dorado Exploraciones, Sociedad An\u00f3nima de Capital Variable;\n\n*\"Enterprises\"* means Pacific Rim El Salvador, Sociedad An\u00f3nima de Capital Variable (also called \"PRES\") and Dorado Exploraciones, Sociedad An\u00f3nima de Capital Variable (also called \"DOREX\");\n\n*\"Governmental Ethics Law\"* means Ley de \u00c9tica Gubernamental (The Respondent\u2019s Governmental Ethics Law);\n\n*\"ICSID Convention\"* means the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes of 1965;\n\n*\"ICSID\"* means the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (also \"the Centre\");\n\n\"*Investment Law*\" means Ley de Inversiones (The Respondent\u2019s Investment Law);\n\n\"*MARN*\" means Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (The Respondent\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources);\n\n*\"MINEC\"* means Ministerio de Econom\u00eda (The Respondent\u2019s Ministry of Economy);\n\n\"*Mining Law*\" means Ley de Miner\u00eda (The Respondent\u2019s Mining Law of 1995, amended in 2001);\n\n*\"ONI\"* means Oficina Nacional de Inversiones (The National Office of Investments, a division of MINEC);\n\n\" *Pacific Rim*\" means Pacific Rim Mining Corporation;\n\n\" *PRC\"* means the Claimant (Pac Rim Cayman LLC);\n\n\" *PRES*\" means Pacific Rim El Salvador, Sociedad An\u00f3nima de Capital Variable\n\n***List of Selected Legal Materials***\n--------------------------------------\n\n***Treaties:***\n---------------\n\nThe Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement of 2004 (\"CAFTA\")\n\nThe ICSID Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes of 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\")\n\nThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 (\"Vienna Convention\")\n\n***Salvadoran Laws:***\n----------------------\n\nInvestment Law, Legislative Decree No. 732, 14 October 1999\n\nMining Law, Legislative Decree No. 544, 14 December 1995, amended by Legislative Decree No. 475, 11 July 2001\n\nRegulations of the Mining Law and its Amendments, Legislative Decree No. 47, 20 June 2003\n\n***Decisions, Awards and Judgments:***\n--------------------------------------\n\n*Alex Genin and others v.

The Claimant is wholly owned by Pacific Rim Mining Corporation (also called \"Pacific Rim\"), a legal person organised under the laws of Canada. In these arbitration proceedings, the Claimant advances several claims against the Respondent both on its own behalf and on behalf of its subsidiary companies, collectively described as the \"Enterprises.\"\n\n1.2.\n\n*The Enterprises* : The Enterprises are legal persons organised under the laws of the Respondent, namely: (i) Pacific Rim El Salvador, Sociedad An\u00f3nima de Capital Variable (also called \"PRES\"), with its principal office at 5 Avda. Norte, No. 16, Barrio San Antonio, Sensuntepeque, Caba\u00f1as, El Salvador; and (ii) Dorado Exploraciones, Sociedad An\u00f3nima de Capital Variable (also called \"DOREX\"), with its principal office at the same address. PRES is the owner of certain rights in the mining areas denominated as \"El Dorado Norte,\" \"El Dorado Sur\" and \"Santa Rita\"; and DOREX is the owner of certain rights in the mining areas denominated as \"Huacuco\", \"Pueblos\" and \"Guaco.\" These mining areas are located in Las Caba\u00f1as and San Vicente, in the northern part of El Salvador.\n\n1.3.\n\n*ICSID & CAFTA* : The Claimant is and has been since 13 December 2007 a national of a Contracting State to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"ICSID Convention\") and the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (\"DR-CAFTA\" or \"CAFTA\"), in force for the USA as from August 2005. Canada is not a Contracting State to CAFTA or the ICSID Convention; and Pacific Rim, being a Canadian legal person, is not and never has been a national of a Contracting State to CAFTA or the ICSID Convention.\n\n1.4.\n\nPrior to 2 March 2012, the Claimant had designated its legal representatives as Messrs Arif H. Ali, Alexandre de Gramont, R. Timothy McCrum, and Theodore Posner Esqs, all of Crowell & Moring LLP, 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004. By letter dated 2 March 2012, the Claimant advised the Secretary of the Tribunal that Messrs Ali, de Gramont, and Posner had changed law firms, and submitted a Power of Attorney providing that Claimant\u2019s legal representatives henceforth be designated as Arif H. Ali, Alexandre de Gramont, and Theodore Posner, Esqs. of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 1300 Eye Street NW, Suite 900, Washington, DC 20005, and R. Timothy McCrum, Ian A. Laird, Kassi D. Tallent, and Ashley R. Riveira of Crowell & Moring LLP, 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004.\n\n1.5.\n\n*The Respondent* : The Respondent is the Republic of El Salvador.\n\n1.6.\n\nThe Respondent is a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention. It is also a Contracting State to CAFTA, in force for the Respondent as from 1 March 2006.\n\n1.7.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s legal representative is Lic. Romeo Benjam\u00edn Barahona, Fiscal General de la Rep\u00fablica, Final 48 Calle Oriente y 19 Avenida Sur, Residencial Primavera, Santa Tecla, La Libertad, EI Salvador. Prior to 10 May 2012, the Respondent had also designated its legal representatives as Messrs Derek C. Smith, Luis Parada, Tom\u00e1s Sol\u00eds and Ms Erin Argueta, all of Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, 1101 New York Avenue NW, Suite 1100, Washington D.C. 20005, USA. By letter dated 10 May 2012, the Respondent submitted a Power of Attorney providing that Messrs Smith, Parada and Sol\u00eds, and Ms Argueta had moved to Foley Hoag LLP, 1875 K Street NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC 20006, but continued to represent the Respondent in this arbitration.\n\n***B: The Dispute***\n--------------------\n\n1.8.\n\n*The Claims:* As asserted by the Claimant (but denied by the Respondent), the claims pleaded by the Claimant (with the Enterprises) allege: (i) the Respondent\u2019s arbitrary and discriminatory conduct, lack of transparency, unfair and inequitable treatment in failing to act upon the Enterprises' applications for a mining exploitation concession and environmental permits following the Claimant\u2019s discovery of valuable deposits of gold and silver under exploration licenses granted by MINEC for the Respondent; (ii) the Respondent's failure to protect the Claimant's investments in accordance with the provisions of its own law and (iii) the Respondent\u2019s unlawful expropriation of the investments of the Claimant (with the Enterprises) in El Salvador.\n\n1.9.\n\nThe details of these claims pleaded by the Claimant are set out in the Decision of 2 August 2010 issued by the Tribunal, to which further reference is made below.\n\n1.10.\n\n*CAFTA:* In pursuance of these claims, it is alleged by the Claimant that the Respondent breached its obligations under Section A of CAFTA, namely: (i) CAFTA Article 10.3: \"National Treatment\"; (ii) CAFTA Article 10.4: \"Most-Favoured Nation Treatment\"; (iii) CAFTA Article 10.5: \"Minimum Standard of Treatment\"; (iv) CAFTA Article 10.7: \"Expropriation and Compensation\"; and (v) CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B): as to \"investment authorizations.\"\n\n1.11.\n\n*Investment Law* : The Claimant also alleges that the Respondent has breached the Salvadoran Investment Law, which prohibits expropriation without compensation, as well as unjustified or discriminatory measures which may hinder the establishment, administration, use, usufruct, extension, sale and liquidation of foreign investments (Article 5 - Equal Protection, Article 6 - Non-Discrimination, and Article 8 - Expropriation).\n\n1.12.\n\n*Other Salvadoran Laws:* The Claimant also alleges that the Respondent has breached the Salvadoran Mining Law (Articles 8, 14, 19 and 23), Article 86 of the Salvadoran Constitution, Article 1 of the Salvadoran Civil Code and Article 4(j) of the Salvadoran Governmental Ethics Law.\n\n1.13.\n\nDuring the Hearing (described below), the Claimant significantly clarified, inter alia, the temporal limits to its CAFTA Claims, namely claims for damages only from the period from March 2008 forwards and not for any earlier period. The Tribunal returns to this late clarification of the Claimant\u2019s pleaded case later in this Decision.\n\n***C: The Tribunal's Decision of 2 August 2010***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1.14.\n\nOn 2 August 2010, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 (for ease of reference, here called \"the Decision of 2 August 2010\").\n\n1.15.\n\nIn Part X of the Decision of 2 August 2010 (paragraph 266), the Tribunal decided for the reasons therein set out:\n\n(1) As to the Respondent\u2019s Objections under CAFTA Article 10.20.4, these objections are not granted by the Tribunal;\n\n(2) As to the Respondent\u2019s Objection under CAFTA Article 10.20.5, this objection is not granted by the Tribunal;\n\n(3) As to costs, the Tribunal here makes no order under CAFTA Article 10.20.6, whilst reserving all its powers as to orders for costs at the final stage of these arbitration proceedings; and\n\n(4) As to all other matters, the Tribunal retains its full powers to decide any further matters in these arbitration proceedings, whether by order, decision or award.\n\n1.16.\n\nThe Decision of 2 August 2010 (with its all recitations and reasons) should be read with this Decision to avoid unnecessary repetition here.\n\n***D: The Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1.17.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Objections to Jurisdiction under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) on 3 August 2010, leading to the further procedure resulting in this Jurisdiction Decision. The Respondent\u2019s Objections comprise four independent grounds to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction: (i) Abuse of Process by the Claimant; (ii) Ratione Temporis; (iii) the Respondent\u2019s Denial of Benefits under CAFTA Article 10.12.2; and (iv) the Investment Law.\n\n1.18.\n\n***Procedural Orders:*** During this further procedure, the Tribunal made a number of procedural orders, all of which were issued or recorded in writing.

Orellana of CIEL, Mr Aaron Marr Page of Forum Nobis PLLC and Mr Stuart G. Gross of Gross Law. (For ease of reference, here described as \"the Amicus Curiae Submission\").\n\n1.34.\n\nThe Tribunal received no application from any other person or body to make submissions as an amicus curiae in these arbitration proceedings (whether timely or otherwise), notwithstanding apparent public statements made by certain persons to the contrary.\n\n1.35.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order dated 23 March 2011 as regards submissions from amici curiae was made available to all interested persons; and it provided (inter alia) as follows:1\n\n*\"In accordance with Article 10.20.3 of the Dominican Republic-Central Amerca United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA-US) and ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), the Tribunal invites any person or entity that is not a Disputing Party in these arbitration proceedings or a Contracting Party to DR-CAFTA-US to make a written application to the Tribunal for permission to file submissions as an amicus curiae.*\n\n*All such written applications should:*\n\n*(1) be emailed to ICSID at icsidsecretariat@worldbank.org by Wednesday, 2 March 2011;*\n\n*(2) in no case exceed 20 pages in all (including the appendix described below);*\n\n*(3) be made in one of the languages of these proceedings, i.e. English or Spanish;*\n\n*(4) be dated and signed by the person or by an authorized signatory for the entity making the application verifying its contents, with address and other contact details;*\n\n*(5) describe the identity and background of the applicant, the nature of any membership if it is an organization and the nature of any relationships to the Disputing Parties and any Contracting Party;*\n\n*(6) disclose whether the applicant has received, directly or indirectly, any financial or other material support from any Disputing Party, Contracting Party or from any person connected with the subject-matter of these arbitration proceedings;*\n\n*(7) specify the nature of the applicant\u2018s interest in these arbitration* *proceedings prompting its application;*\n\n*(8) include (as an appendix to the application) a copy of the applicant\u2018s* *written submissions to be filed in these arbitration proceedings, assuming permission is granted by the Tribunal for such filing, such submissions to address only matters within the scope of the subject-matter of these arbitration proceedings; and*\n\n*(9) explain, insofar as not already answered, the reason(s) why the Tribunal should grant permission to the applicant to file its written submissions in these arbitration proceedings as an amicus curiae...\"*\n\nThe full text was and remains published on ICSID\u2019s web-site at: http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=OpenPage&PageType= AnnouncementsFrame&FromPage=Announcements&pageName=Announcement81.\n\n1.36.\n\nThe Amicus Curiae Submission received by this Tribunal addressed the following matters: (i) the factual background to the dispute raised by the Claimant in these arbitration proceedings, (ii) whether there exists any \"legal dispute\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention or any \"measure\" under CAFTA Article 10.1, as distinct from the Claimant\u2019s dissatisfaction with Salvadoran public policy in recent years and the \"independently-organized communities who have risen up against the Claimant\u2019s projects, i.e. [the] amici\"; (iii) whether the Claimant\u2019s claim amounts to an abuse of process; and (iv) the Respondent\u2019s denial of benefits under CAFTA Article 10.12.2.\n\n1.37.\n\nThe Amicus Curiae Submission concludes:\n\n*\"The general political debate concerning sustainability, metals mining and democracy in El Salvador is ongoing. Pac Rim has attempted to influence the political debate, but has been disappointed in its lobbying efforts. Dissatisfied with the direction of the democratic dialogue, Pac Rim has abused the arbitral process by changing its nationality to attract jurisdiction. The Tribunal should not sanction this abuse and, more important, has no jurisdiction to hear a complaint against the course of a political debate.\"*\n\n1.38.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Amicus Curiae Submission does not address the further jurisdictional issues raised by the Respondent regarding \"Ratione Temporis\" and the \"Investment Law.\" The Tribunal also notes that the Respondent, unlike the Amicus Curiae Submission, has not impugned this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction by reference to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and CAFTA Article 10.1.\n\n***G: The Parties' Claims for Relief as regards Jurisdiction***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.39.\n\n***The Respondent:*** In its Jurisdiction Memorial (paragraph 476), the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) Issue an award dismissing all claims in this arbitration for lack of jurisdiction resulting from the Claimant\u2019s abuse of process;\n\n(ii) Award the Respondent all arbitration costs and legal fees incurred in this arbitration, plus interest.\n\n1.40.\n\nIn its Reply Costs Submissions, the Respondent rejected the Claimant\u2019s request for an order for costs.\n\n1.41.\n\n***The Claimant:*** In its Post-Hearing Submissions (paragraph 113), Costs Submission (paragraph 35) and Reply Costs Submission (paragraph 3), the Claimant requests this Tribunal:\n\n(i) to deny all of the jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent with prejudice;\n\n(ii) to enter a procedural order for concluding the remainder of this case in a single, expeditious phase;\n\n(iii) to issue an order allocating to Respondent all the costs of these proceedings to date; and\n\n(iv) to decline the Respondent\u2019s request for an award of costs.\n\n1.42.\n\n***The Tribunal's Request to the Parties:*** By letter dated 13 September 2011 (communicated to the Parties by the Tribunal\u2019s Secretary), the Tribunal requested the Parties\u2019 assistance in clarifying the jurisdictional objections addressed by the Parties in these arbitration proceedings, as follows:\n\n\" ***...***  *During its current deliberations (which are not complete), the Tribunal has noted that the unnumbered first sub-paragraph of Paragraph 476 in the \"Prayers for Relief\" of Part IX (page 152) of the Respondent\u2018s Memorial on its Objections to Jurisdiction dated 15 October 2010 may not be wholly consistent with the full list of jurisdictional objections pleaded both earlier in that same document (for example, see Paragraph 457, at pages 145-146) and the Respondent\u2018s subsequent written and oral submissions to the Tribunal, as also addressed by the Claimant.*\n\n*If there were in fact any inconsistency, the Tribunal requests the Parties to clarify the full list of the jurisdictional objections addressed in these arbitration proceedings.*\n\n*Accordingly, the Tribunal requests the Respondent (as the Disputing Party raising jurisdictional objections) briefly to clarify in writing the full list of its jurisdictional objections as soon as possible but no later than 26 September 2011; and the Tribunal requests the Claimant (as the Disputing Party responding to such objections) to* *respond briefly in writing to such clarification, within two weeks of its receipt...\"*\n\n1.43.\n\nThe Respondent responded to the Tribunal\u2019s request by letter dated 26 September 2011, confirming (inter alia) the list of its objections as summarised in an attached \"outline\", as follows (with underlining and other emphasis here omitted):\n\n*\"I: Primary Objection against all claims in this arbitration: Abuse of Process*\n\n*If the Tribunal finds that Claimant\u2018s actions constitute Abuse of Process, El Salvador requests the Tribunal to dismiss the entire arbitration (Memorial, para. 71) by:*\n\n*A: Rejecting jurisdiction and dismissing all claims under CAFTA (Memorial, pa* *ras. 61-70); and*\n\n*B: Rejecting jurisdiction and dismissing all claims under the Investment Law of* *El Salvador (Memorial, paras. 103-105).*\n\n*II: Alternative Objections:*\n\n*A: Alternative 1* ***:***  *If the Tribunal decides that there is no Abuse of Process:*\n\n*(1) With regard to the CAFTA claims, El Salvador requests the Tribunal to dismiss all CAFTA claims for lack of jurisdiction based on any of the following independent objections:*\n\n*(i) Denial of benefits provisions of CAFTA (Memorial, para. 106; 253-254); or*\n\n*(ii) Pac-Rim Cayman is not an Investor of a Party (Memorial, paras. 256259); or*\n\n*(iii) There is no jurisdiction ratione temporis (Memorial, paras. 305-318); or*\n\n*(iv) CAFTA\u2018s three-year statute of limitations precludes consideration of Claimant\u2018s main claims (Memorial, paras. 324-336);and*\n\n*(2) With regard to the Investment Law claims, El Salvador requests the Tribunal to dismiss all claims under the Investment Law of El Salvador for lack of jurisdiction based on any of the following independent objections:*\n\n*a.

Indivisibility of the CAFTA claims and the Investment Law claims (Memorial, para. 105).*\n\n*B: Alternative 2: If the Tribunal finds that Claimant\u2018s actions constituted Abuse* *of Process, but that the Abuse of Process only affects the CAFTA claims and only results in the rejection of jurisdiction under CAFTA,*\n\n*(1) El Salvador requests the Tribunal to also dismiss all claims under the Investment Law for lack of jurisdiction based on any of the independent objections listed in paragraph II.A.2 above, i.e.,*\n\n*a.

Article 15 of the Investment Law does not constitute consent (Memorial, paras. 337-379); or, in the alternative, the Investment Law claims are inadmissible (Memorial, paras. 424-427); or*\n\n*e. Indivisibility of the CAFTA claims and the Investment Law claims (Memorial, para. 105).\"*\n\n1.44.\n\nThe Claimant responded by letter dated 10 October 2011 to the Tribunal\u2019s request, stating (inter alia) as follows:\n\n*\"... Claimant wishes to observe that Respondent's recitation of its objections in the September letter is not entirely consistent with its previous pleadings, and in some instances is internally contradictory. The primary ambiguity arises from Respondent\u2018s seemingly interchangeable use of the terms,\"dismiss for lack of jurisdiction \" and \"reject jurisdiction. \" For example, in their first paragraph of page 2 of the September letter, Respondent asserts that if the Tribunal finds an abuse of process, it should dismiss all claims \"for lack of jurisdiction.\" In the following paragraph, however it asserts that the consequence of a finding of abuse of process would be for the Tribunal to \"reject jurisdiction under CAFTA.\"*\n\n*A dismissal for lack of jurisdiction occurs where a claimant has failed to demonstrate that the requirements for jurisdiction are satisfied. On the other hand, the notion of \"rejecting\" jurisdiction indicates that the requirements for jurisdiction have been proved - i.e., jurisdiction exists - but the tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, chooses not to accept jurisdiction. Here, this distinction is relevant because Respondent has raised objections to the Tribunal\u2018s jurisdiction ratione temporis (under CAFTA) and ratione personae and voluntatis (under the Investment Law), while also raising objections that, in Respondents own words, \"**are not strictly tied to the requirements for jurisdiction,* *like Abuse of Process and Denial of Benefits.\"*\n\n*Given the manner in which Respondent has articulated its objections (as opposed to the relief which it may have requested in connection therewith, or the order in which the objections may have been presented), Claimant does not understand the objection dubbed \"Abuse of Process\" to be an objection based on a \"lack of jurisdiction.\" As Respondent has described it in its Objections, its abuse of process argument is derived from a judicial doctrine of a discretionary nature, whereby an international tribunal may decline to exercise its jurisdiction if it concludes, based on an assessment of the \"particular facts and circumstances of the case,\" that to do so would undermine the tribunal\u2018s integrity or otherwise constitute an abuse of the arbitral procedure.*\n\n*In Claimant\u2018s view, it is clear that abuse of process, as an equitable doctrine, is not* *relevant to the question of whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute. Indeed, as it has emphasized on past occasions, Claimant is not aware of any investment arbitration tribunal having dismissed an entire case for lack of jurisdiction on the sole basis of abuse of process. In this regard, Claimant has repeatedly referred to the guidance provided by the Rompetrol tribunal, cautioning that dismissal on the sole basis of abuse of process would require a tribunal to disregard the jurisdiction that it is \"bound to exercise\" under the terms of the Washington Convention; and that a tribunal certainly is not in a position, \"at [a] very preliminary stage, before it has even had the benefit of the Claimant\u2018s case laid out in detail in a Memorial, let alone the supporting evidence,\" to assess a question of abuse of process, including the attendant considerations of the Claimant\u2018s motivation in bringing its claims to arbitration.*\n\n*In conclusion, Claimant submits that Respondent\u2018s abuse of process objections is a* *request for an extraordinary remedy under which the Tribunal may decline to exercise its jurisdiction even where all of the jurisdictional requirements have been met, because it has concluded that the arbitral process has been so severely abused that it would be improper to hear the merits of the dispute. In this case, there is more than enough argument and evidence presently before the Tribunal to demonstrate that such a remedy would be entirely unwarranted and inappropriate. Thus, notwithstanding that the abuse of process objection does not and cannot per se affect the Tribunal\u2018s jurisdiction, Claimant submits that the Tribunal should proceed to evaluate and reject the objection and the associated relief requested...\"*\n\n1.45.\n\nBy letter dated 18 October 2011 (communicated by the Tribunal\u2019s Secretary), the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Parties\u2019 two responses, having also noted their respective contents for the purpose of this Decision.\n\n***H: The Jurisdictional Issues***\n----------------------------------\n\n1.46.\n\nIt is convenient for the purpose of this Decision to describe the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections under four separate headings: (A) the \"Abuse of Process\" issue regarding the Claimant\u2019s claims under CAFTA; (B) the \"Ratione Temporis\" issue; (C) the \"Denial of Benefits\" issue regarding the Claimant\u2019s claims under CAFTA; and (D) the \"Investment Law\" issue regarding the Claimant\u2019s Non-CAFTA claims. The Abuse of Process Issue does not apply to the Claimant\u2019s Non-CAFTA claims, as determined by the Tribunal. In addition, the Tribunal addresses the Parties\u2019 respective claims for Legal and Arbitration Costs (E).\n\n1.47.\n\nIn addressing these Issues A to E, the Tribunal has considered all the written and oral submissions made by the Parties. In order to explain the grounds for this Decision, it is necessary below to cite or summarise a certain number of these submissions at some length, but not all of them. The fact that a submission is not cited or summarised below does not signify that it was not considered by the Tribunal in arriving at this Decision.\n\n***ANNEX TO PART 1: THE RELEVANT LEGAL TEXTS***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1.1.\n\nIt is appropriate here, for later ease of reference, to set out the relevant legal texts from (i) the Investment Law, (ii) CAFTA, (iii) the ICSID Convention, (iv) the ICSID Arbitration Rules and (v) the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility.\n\n***(01) The Investment Law***\n-----------------------------\n\n1.2.\n\nArticle 15(a) of the Investment Law provides (as translated by the Claimant from the original Spanish into English), in relevant part:\n\n*\"In the case of disputes arising among foreign investors and the State, regarding their investments in El Salvador, the investors may submit the controversy to: (a) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (lCSID), in order to settle the dispute by... arbitration, in accordance with the Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Investors of Other States (ICSID Convention)...\"*\n\n1.3.\n\nThe original Spanish text of Article 15 of the Investment Law provides, in full:\n\n\"*En caso que surgieren controversias \u00f3 diferencias entre los inversionistas nacionales o extranjeros y el Estado, referentes a inversiones de aquellos, efectuadas en El Salvador, las partes podr\u00e1n acudir a los tribunales de justicia competentes, de acuerdo a los procedimientos legales.

A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of another Party that is an enterprise of such other Party and to investments of that investor if persons of a non-Party own or control the enterprise and the denying Party:*\n\n*(a) does not maintain diplomatic relations with the non-Party; or*\n\n*(b) adopts or maintains measures with respect to the non-Party or a person of the non-Party that prohibit transactions with the enterprise or that would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded to the enterprise or to its investments.*\n\n*2. Subject to Articles 18.3 (Notification and Provision of Information) and 20.4* *(Consultations), a Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of another Party that is an enterprise of such other Party and to investments of that investor if the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the territory of any Party, other than the denying Party, and persons of a nonParty, or of the denying Party, own or control the enterprise.\"*\n\n1.6.\n\n***CAFTA Article 10.15: Consultation and Negotiation***\n\n*\"In the event of an investment dispute, the claimant and the respondent should initially seek to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation, which may* *include the use of non-binding, third-party procedures such as conciliation and mediation.\"*\n\n1.7.\n\n***CAFTA Article 10.16: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration***\n\n*\"1.

Although, as later determined by the Tribunal in this Decision, it is not the decisive issue as regards the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections to the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA claims, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to begin with it as a matter of courtesy to the Parties.\n\n***(02) The Burden and Standard of Proof***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n2.2.\n\nThe Tribunal has first to establish its general approach to the question of proof for the purpose of this issue, as with other jurisdictional issues. Two distinct factors are relevant: (i) the burden of proof, i.e. on which party the obligation rests to prove its case; and (ii) the standard of proof required to discharge that burden, i.e. whether it is a \"prima facie\" standard (as submitted by the Claimant) or a different standard.\n\n2.3.\n\n*Standard of Proof:* As far as the standard of proof is concerned, both in its Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to \"accept pro tem the facts as alleged by [the Claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret [the relevant provisions of the treaty] for jurisdictional purposes;\"2 and the Claimant cited a number of decisions that have allegedly applied such an approach, including (in its submission) the *Phoenix* award.\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 37.\n\n2.4.\n\nIn contrast, the Respondent submitted that the Claimant\u2019s factual allegations relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction cannot enjoy any special status as assumed facts. The Respondent contended that the Claimant must meet its full standard of proof or the Claimant\u2019s allegations must be considered unproven, with necessarily adverse consequences for the Claimant\u2019s jurisdictional case.3\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00a7 12.\n\n2.5.\n\nAt an early jurisdictional stage of an arbitration, as regards facts alleged by a claimant in its pleadings but not admitted or even denied by a respondent, the Tribunal acknowledges that it is often said that an arbitration tribunal is required to test the factual basis of a claimant\u2019s claim by reference only to a \"prima facie\" standard - as regards the merits of such claim. That standard was most clearly expressed by Judge Higgins in the well-known passage from her separate opinion in *Oil Platforms;* and it has been applied, as a general practice, by many tribunals in addressing jurisdictional objections made in many investor-state arbitrations.4\n\nThese materials are considered by Schreuer (et al), *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed), pp. 540-542.\n\n2.6.\n\nIn this case, as regards the Respondent\u2019s several jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal is not minded to accept the Claimant\u2019s submissions, for two reasons.\n\n2.7.\n\nFirst, this Tribunal has already received from both Parties a substantial mass of written and oral evidence, including the cross-examination of certain important witnesses at the Hearing. Accordingly, having received such extensive evidential materials directed at factual issues, the Tribunal thinks it inappropriate to apply to those issues a lesser standard of proof in favour of the Claimant, when the Tribunal can arrive fairly at its decision on a sufficient evidential record to which both Parties have had a full opportunity to contribute and, moreover, have also substantially contributed.\n\n2.8.\n\nSecond, but more importantly, the Tribunal considers that it is impermissible for the Tribunal to found its jurisdiction on any of the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA claims on the basis of an assumed fact (i.e. alleged by the Claimant in its pleadings as regards jurisdiction but disputed by the Respondent). The application of that \"prima facie\" or other like standard is limited to testing the merits of a claimant\u2019s case at a jurisdictional stage; and it cannot apply to a factual issue upon which a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction directly depends, such as the Abuse of Process, Ratione Temporis and Denial of Benefits issues in this case. In the context of factual issues which are common to both jurisdictional issues and the merits, there could be, of course, no difficulty in joining the same factual issues to the merits. That, however, is not the situation here, where a factual issue relevant only to jurisdiction and not to the merits requires more than a decision *pro tempore* by a tribunal.\n\n2.9.\n\nThe *Phoenix* award makes the point clearly, as follows:\n\n\" *In the Tribunal\u2018s view, it cannot take all the facts as alleged by the Claimant as granted facts, as it should do according to the Claimant, but must look into the role these facts play either at the jurisdictional level or at the merits level, as asserted by the Respondent.*\n\n*If the alleged facts are facts that, if proven, would constitute a violation of the relevant BIT, they have indeed to be accepted as such at the jurisdictional stage, until their existence is ascertained or not at the merits level. On the contrary, if jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage.\"*5\n\nAccordingly, this Tribunal is here required to determine finally whether it has jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA claims on the proven existence of certain facts because all relevant facts supporting such jurisdiction must be established by the Claimant at this jurisdictional stage and not merely assumed in the Claimant\u2019s favour.\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd v. Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, \u00a7\u00a7 60-61. [ *Phoenix v. Czech Republic* ]\n\n2.10.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides, in regard to all disputed facts relevant to the jurisdictional issues under CAFTA not to apply the lesser \"prima facie\" standard in favour of the Claimant; but, rather, the higher standard of proof applicable to both Parties\u2019 cases, whether it be described as the preponderance of the evidence or a standard based on a balance of probabilities. In arriving at this decision, the Tribunal has noted that the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on Abuse of Process by the Claimant does not, in legal theory, operate as a bar to the existence of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction; but, rather, as a bar to the exercise of that jurisdiction, necessarily assuming jurisdiction to exist. For present purposes, the Tribunal considers this to be a distinction without a difference.\n\n2.11.\n\n*Burden of Proof:* As far as the burden of proof is concerned, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it cannot here be disputed that the party which alleges something positive has ordinarily to prove it to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. At this jurisdictional level, in other words, the Claimant has to prove that the Tribunal has jurisdiction. Of course, if there are positive objections to jurisdiction, the burden lies on the Party presenting those objections, in other words, here the Respondent.\n\n2.12.\n\nThis sharing of the burden of proof has been stated in *Chevron v. Ecuador* in the following terms:\n\n*\"As a general rule, the holder of a right raising a claim on the basis of that right in legal proceedings bears the burden of proof for all elements required for the claim. However, an exception to this rule occurs when a respondent raises a defense to the effect that the claim is precluded despite the normal conditions being met. In that case, the respondent must assume the burden of proof for the elements necessary for the exception to be allowed.\"6*\n\n*Chevron Corporation (USA) and Texaco Petroleum Company (USA) v. The Republic of Ecuador*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 34877, Interim Award, 1 December 2008, \u00a7 138.\n\n2.13.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the burden lies on a claimant who asserts a positive right and on a respondent who asserts a positive answer to the claimant. The Tribunal does not consider the latter to be an exception to the former, both being (in its view) the application from a different perspective of the same general principle that the party which asserts a positive case has to prove that case. In this case, the Claimant is asserting that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Parties\u2019 dispute; and, as regards this first jurisdictional objection, the Respondent is asserting an abuse of process by the Claimant.\n\n2.14.\n\nThis general approach was analysed by the *Chevron* tribunal in relation to a respondent\u2019s positive objection asserting abuse of process by a claimant, not dissimilar to the present case:\n\n*\"A claimant is not required to prove that its claim is asserted in a non-abusive manner; it is for the respondent to raise and prove an abuse of process as a defense.\"*7\n\n*Ibid*., \u00a7 139.\n\n2.15.\n\nIn summary, it is the Tribunal\u2019s opinion that it is not bound to accept the facts necessary to support or deny jurisdiction as alleged by the Claimant and the Respondent respectively; that the Claimant has the burden to prove facts necessary to establish jurisdiction (as it positively asserts); and that the Respondent has the burden to prove that its positive objections to jurisdiction are well-founded. Accordingly, for the purpose of this Decision, the Tribunal adopts a general approach to the Parties\u2019 disputed factual allegations whereby all the elements of proof adduced by the Parties are considered by the Tribunal for the purpose of assessing whether the Claimant and the Respondent have discharged their respective burdens to prove their respective cases.\n\n***(03) The Respondent's Case***\n--------------------------------\n\n2.16.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent\u2019s presentation of its jurisdictional objection based on Abuse of Process begins with a statement of facts, which are not contested by the Claimant:\n\n*\"Pacific Rim Mining Corp. is a Canadian company that applied for an environmental permit and a mining exploitation concession in El Salvador through one of its subsidiaries in 2004. The environmental permit and the concession were not granted. Three years later, in December of 2007, Pacific Rim Mining Corp. changed the nationality of another subsidiary, Pac Rim Cayman, from the Cayman Islands to the United States...\"8*\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 1\n\n2.17.\n\nThe Respondent then makes its legal analysis on these facts, which (as will be seen later in this Decision) is strongly contested by the Claimant. In the Respondent\u2019s submission, the Claimant has \"abused the provisions of CAFTA and the international arbitration process by changing Pac Rim Cayman's nationality to a CAFTA Party to bring a pre-existing dispute before this Tribunal under CAFTA.\"\n\n2.18.\n\nThis objection is the major part of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections. As confirmed in its Jurisdiction Reply, \"El Salvador's main jurisdictional objection is Claimant's Abuse of Process.\" This was re-confirmed in the Respondent\u2019s letter dated September 26, 2011 sent to the Tribunal (cited in Part 1 above).\n\n2.19.\n\nIn presenting this main objection, the Respondent does not object to prospective nationality planning made in good faith before any investment. The Respondent objects to the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality because of its timing at a much later date, made in deliberate bad faith:\n\n*\"What Claimant and its parent company did in the present case, however, is not*  *prospective nationality planning* *but a*  *retrospective* *gaming of the system to gain jurisdiction for an*  *existing* *dispute based on existing facts over which there would not otherwise be jurisdiction. This is an abuse of the international arbitration system and process.*\"9\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 18. Emphasis by the Respondent.\n\n2.20.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position was summarised at the outset of its Post-Hearing Submissions:\n\n\" *Pacific Rim Mining Corp., a Canadian corporation, through its wholly-owned shell subsidiary, Pac Rim Cayman, has abused the international arbitration process by changing Pac Rim Cayman's nationality from the Cayman Islands to the United States, and then using this nationality to initiate ICSID arbitration proceedings for a pre-existing dispute and assert claims under CAFTA and the Investment Law of El Salvador as a national of the United States. The consequence of this abuse can only be the dismissal of this entire arbitration.*\"10\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 2.\n\n***(04) The Claimant's Case***\n------------------------------\n\n2.21.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant submits that its change of nationality was not an abuse of process because it was part of an overall plan to restructure the Pac Rim group of companies. According to the Claimant, \"(i)n 2007, the Companies were looking for ways to save money;\"11 and as a result, changes are alleged to have been envisioned, as follows:\n\n\"*This led to an examination of the overall corporate structure of the Companies. There were administrative costs involved in maintaining Pac Rim Cayman as a Cayman Islands entity. At the same time, the Companies were advised that there would be no adverse tax consequences to domesticating Pac Rim Cayman to Nevada - the jurisdiction from which it had been effectively managed by Mr. Shrake since 1997. In other words, the Companies believed that by domesticating Pac Rim Cayman to Nevada, they could eliminate the costs of maintaining Pac Rim Cayman in* *the Cayman Islands, without losing any tax benefits. It made no sense to manage a Cayman Islands company from Nevada, if that company could be domesticated to Nevada with cost savings and no adverse tax consequences*.\"12\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 136.\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 138.\n\n2.22.\n\nThis was an incomplete explanation on the evidential materials adduced by the Claimant itself, particularly from its principal factual witness, Mr Shrake. Even before the Hearing, Mr Shrake candidly acknowledged that the availability of international arbitration (under CAFTA and ICSID) was one of the elements of its decision to change the Claimant\u2019s nationality:\n\n*\"The ability of Pac Rim Cayman to bring claims under CAFTA, if a dispute with El Salvador were to arise in the future, was one of the factors I considered, and which - with others - weighed in favour of the reorganization.\"13*\n\nMr Shrake\u2019s Witness Statement, \u00a7 113. See also, to the same effect, the Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 139: \"*A* s *part of this overall assessment of the Companies\u2018 organizational structure, Mr. Shrake also considered the Companies\u2018 potential avenues of recourse if a dispute were ever to arise with El Salvador in the future.\"*\n\n2.23.\n\nThe Claimant nonetheless submitted that the events giving rise to the Parties\u2019 dispute occurred after this change of nationality on 13 December 2007; and, given that timing, the change cannot be characterised as an abuse of process by the Claimant. It was said that a change in nationality can be triggered by many reasons; and if nationality planning for the purpose of international arbitration can be made in good faith as one of several reasons before an investment is made (as the Respondent acknowledges), then why not a change made in like good faith after an investment but before any dispute has arisen?\n\n2.24.\n\nIn the present case, however, the timing is important. For the Respondent, CAFTA came into force on 1 March 2006; the Claimant changed its nationality in 13 December 2007 whereupon, ostensibly, it acquired substantive and procedural rights under CAFTA; President Saca\u2019s speech was publicly reported on 11 March 2008; and the Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration on 30 April 2009.\n\n2.25.\n\nFrom the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Intent onwards, the Claimant has pleaded \"unlawful and politically motivated measures\" taken by the Respondent before 13 December 2007, including (as alleged) the arbitrary imposition of unreasonable delays and unprecedented regulatory obstacles designed and implemented with the aim of preventing PRES and DOREX from developing gold mining rights in which the Claimant, through those Enterprises, had made substantial and long-term investments.14 As pleaded by the Claimant, many of these events necessarily pre-dated the speech of President Saca in March 2008, allegedly confirming the opposition of the Respondent\u2019s Government to granting mining permits.15\n\nNotice of Intent, Introduction, pp. 1-2.\n\nNotice of Intent, \u00a7 32.\n\n2.26.\n\nIn the Notice of Arbitration, the following measures were also alleged by the Claimant against the Respondent, as taking place before December 2007:\n\n*\"As previously set out in the Notice of Intent and further summarized herein, PRC\u2018s claims arise out of unlawful and politically motivated measures taken by the Government of President Elias Antonio Saca Gonzalez, through the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (\"MARN\") and MINEC, against Claimants investments.\"*\n\n2.27.\n\nAs regards the speech of President Saca, the Claimant alleges first: \"in March 2008, President Saca abruptly and without any justification announced that he opposed granting any new mining permits.\"16 The Claimant next alleges that the permit had been earlier refused by MARN on the instructions of the Government: \"it is now apparent that MARN\u2019s inaction had been directed from above, and specifically from the offices of President Saca.\"17 These events cover a period which, at least in part, pre-date December 2007. The Claimant alleges that President Saca\u2019s speech revealed that the permit refusals were made following an existing policy by the Government and were not mere bureaucratic incidents: \"In 2008, it became clear that the Government\u2019s delay tactics with respect to the issuance of the Enterprises\u2019 various permits had been designed and implemented with the unlawful, discriminatory, and 18 politically motivated aim of preventing the Enterprises\u2019 mining.\"18\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00a7 9.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00a7 64.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00a7 74.\n\n2.28.\n\nIn other words, as here alleged by the Claimant, President Saca\u2019s speech (postDecember 2007) expressed a \"newly announced \"policy\u2019 of opposing the issuance of mining permits;\"19 and the earlier refusal of the Government (pre-December 2007) to act upon the Enterprises\u2019 applications for permits therefore constituted \"a gross 20 abuse of administrative discretion.\"20\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00a7 77.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00a7 81.\n\n2.29.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial, the Claimant again focused on the speech given by President Saca in March 2008:\n\n*\"Even if Respondent contests the existence of a mining ban (despite the public statements of President Saca and his successor, President Funes), its characterization of the measure at issue as a single act or omission completed in December 2004 still is incorrect, because the failure of MARN to act in December 2004, together with subsequent failures to act by MARN and its sister ministry, Ministerio de Econom\u00eda (\"MINEC\"), is a situation that continued to exist after the key jurisdictional thresholds were crossed, thus causing it to come within the scope of CAFTA\u2018s Investment Chapter.\"*21\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 19.\n\n2.30.\n\nAnother citation from the Claimant\u2019s earlier pleadings to the same effect, amongst many others, can be reproduced here, because it refers not only to \"continuing\" acts or omissions alleged against the Respondent, but also to \"composite\" acts or omissions:\n\n*\"Even if the Tribunal were to accept Respondent\u2018s assertion that, despite the public statements of two successive heads of State, the de facto mining ban does not exist, the individual instances of Respondent\u2018s failure to grant Claimant\u2018s mining-related* *applications are continuing or composite acts or omissions that breach CAFTA obligations.*\"22\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 163.\n\n2.31.\n\nIn its Jurisdiction Rejoinder, the Claimant returned to the alleged significance of the de facto ban:\n\n*\"As explained in the Notice of Arbitration, it is the de facto mining ban confirmed by* *President Saca - as opposed to any individual missed deadlines under the Mining Law or the Environmental Law - that rendered Claimant\u2018s investments valueless.\"23*\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7 235.\n\n2.32.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submissions, as at the Hearing, the Claimant presented the relevant measure as a \"practice\" covering both an earlier period of time when CAFTA did not apply (either pre-December 2007 or even pre-March 2006) and a later period of time when it did apply to the Claimant, namely, as a continuing course of conduct by the Respondent that existed before and after the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality on 13 December 2007:\n\n*\"The measure at issue as consistently identified in Claimants pleadings is El Salvador\u2018s practice of withholding permits necessary for metallic mining: This measure is a continuing course of conduct by Respondent which may have begun before CAFTA became applicable to Claimant, but continued thereafter (indeed, to this very day)* *and which Claimant became aware of at the earliest in March 2008, when El Salvador\u2018s President first confirmed the existence of a de facto mining ban.\"*24\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 3.\n\n2.33.\n\nAs regards the date when the Parties\u2019 dispute arose, the Claimant alleges that it arose only in March 2008 and not before, i.e. it came into existence as a continuing or composite act after the change in the Claimant\u2019s nationality in December 2007:\n\n\"T*he act supporting Pac Rim Cayman's claims of breach resulting in loss or damage is Respondent's de facto ban on mining as announced by President Saca in March 2008.... As relevant to Respondent's abuse of process argument, since the act giving rise to the dispute did not occur until March 2008 or, alternatively, only became recognizable as a continuing or composite act in breach of CAFTA obligations at that time, Pac Rim Cayman's domestication to Nevada in December 2007 could not* *have been \"a*  *retrospective* *gaming of the system to gain jurisdiction for an*  *existing*  *dispute.*\"25\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 376. Emphasis by the Claimant. *See also* \u00a7 11 of the Respondent\u2019s PostHearing Submissions.\n\n2.34.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimant\u2019s pleaded case had developed significantly from its early pleadings by the end of the Hearing, as not infrequently happens during a complicated arbitration. This development has, however, created certain difficulties for the Tribunal, to which it is necessary to return below.\n\n***(05) The CAFTA Member States***\n----------------------------------\n\n2.35.\n\nThe USA Submission addresses Denial of Benefits and does not address the issue of Abuse of Process. The Costa Rica Submission likewise does not address Abuse of Process, concentrating mostly on Denial of Benefits.\n\n***(06) Amicus Curiae Submission***\n-----------------------------------\n\n2.36.\n\nThe Amicus Curiae Submission does address the issue of Abuse of Proces s (in addition to other matters), first in general terms:\n\n*\"The facts underlying Claimants claim are deeply intertwined with the social and political change that has occurred since the advent of representative democracy in post-civil war El Salvador, and there is little doubt that the Tribunal\u2018s decision to accept or reject jurisdiction over a claim of this nature could impact the transition toward democracy in El Salvador. The Tribunal\u2018s decision could also impact the communities amici represent - their lands, their livelihoods, and even their wellbeing and fundamental rights.\"*\n\n2.37.\n\nThis Amicus Curiae next contends that the Claimant\u2019s claims amount to an abuse of process for two reasons, the first developed by the Respondent (as summarised above) and the second that is specific to its own Amicus Curiae Submission:\n\n*\"1. Pac Rim\u2018s last minute re-organization to take advantage of CAFTA benefits after setting itself up to enjoy the benefits of Cayman Islands\u2018 zero taxation is abusive in nature.*\n\n*2. Pac Rim\u2018s attempt to take a dispute centered between it and the affected communities to a forum where the communities have only limited discretionary rights is abusive in nature...\"*\n\n2.38.\n\nThe Amicus Curiae Submission contends, that in relying only on the first of these two reasons, \"the Republic has, in fact, underestimated the extent of the abuse of process\" (p. 10), because this dispute is, in fact, not a dispute between an investor and a host State but a dispute between an investor and the local communities of which the State is only an intermediary.\n\n2.39.\n\nThe Amicus Curiae Submission alleges that this is a purely political dispute and therefore that the Parties\u2019 dispute is not a \"legal dispute\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, nor relates to a \"measure\" under CAFTA Article 10.1. The Tribunal will limit itself here to the Amicus\u2019 arguments relating to the Abuse of Process issue.\n\n2.40.\n\nThe Amicus Curiae Submission addresses the motivation for the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality, basing itself on Mr Shrake\u2019s testimony. It considers that stating that one of the motives for the change was to save a few thousand dollars in annual corporate registration fees is fanciful; but even if it were one element of the decisionmaking process, the Claimant\u2019s access to international arbitration was another factor; and that factor is sufficient for the Tribunal to find here that there has been an abuse of process by the Claimant. As alleged by the Amicus Curiae Submission:\n\n*\"Moreover, regardless of whether the benefit of CAFTA dispute resolution was a primary or secondary motivation, the fact that it is a motivation is all that the relevant prong of the abuse of process inquiry requires.\" (p. 10)*\n\n***(07) The Tribunal's Analysis***\n----------------------------------\n\n2.41.\n\nThe Tribunal finds as a relevant fact, based on the Claimant\u2019s own evidential materials, that one of the principal purposes of the change in the Claimant\u2019s nationality was the access thereby gained to the protection of investment rights under CAFTA and its procedure for international arbitration available against the Respondent. Although the Tribunal accepts that another purpose was to save unnecessary expenses for the Pacific Rim group of companies, the Tribunal finds, as a fact, again based on the Claimant\u2019s own evidential materials, that such a purpose was not the dominant, still less the only, motive for the change. As rightly emphasized by the Respondent, \"...Claimant presents no evidence that the costs of maintaining a limited liability company in Nevada are significantly cheaper than being incorporated in the Cayman Islands.\"26\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00a7 87.\n\n2.42.\n\nAccordingly, the factual situation here is materially similar to the facts found by the tribunal in the *Mobil v. Venezuela* case, that \". the main, if not the sole purpose of the restructuring was to protect Mobil investments from adverse Venezuelan measures in getting access to ICSID arbitration through the Dutch-Venezuela BIT.\"27\n\n*Mobil Corporation and others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010, \u00a7 190. [*Mobil v. Venezuela*]\n\n2.43.\n\nThat, however, is not a sufficient answer to determine the issue of Abuse of Process in this case. The Tribunal does not accept the arguments made to the contrary in the Amicus Curiae Submission. As already described, there is an important issue of timing and other circumstances in this case, to which it is necessary to return below at some length.\n\n2.44.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal subscribes to the general approach set out in the decision made in *Mobil v. Venezuela:*\n\n*\"The Tribunal first observes that in all systems of law, whether domestic or international, there are concepts framed in order to avoid misuse of the law. Reference may be made in this respect to \"good faith\" (\"bonne foi\"), \"d\u00e9tournement de pouvoir\" (misuse of power) or \"abus de droit\" (abuse of right).\"*28\n\n*Mobil v. Venezuela*, *supra* note 27, \u00a7 169.\n\n2.45.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s restructuring consisted of its change of nationality on 13 December 2007. To adopt the tribunal\u2019s approach in *Mobil v. Venezuela*, \"(s)uch restructuring could be \"legitimate corporate planning\u2019 as contended by the Claimant or an \"abuse of right\u2019 as submitted by the Respondent. It depends upon the circumstances in which it happened.\"29 As already summarised above, it is not contested between the Parties that the circumstances of this case are decisive as to the time when the relevant measure(s) occurred and the Parties\u2019 dispute arose, whether before or after the change in the Claimant\u2019s nationality on 13 December 2007.\n\n*Ibid,* \u00a7 191.\n\n2.46.\n\nThis important question of timing was also explained in the *Phoenix* award:\n\n*\"International investors can of course structure*  *upstream* *their investments, which meet the requirement of participating in the economy of the host State, in a manner that best fits their need for international protection, in choosing freely the vehicle through which they perform their investment....*\n\n*But on the other side, an international investor cannot modify*  *downstream* *the protection granted to its investment by the host State, once the acts which the investor considers are causing damages to its investment have already been committed.\"*30\n\n*Phoenix v. Czech Republic*, *supra,* note 5 *,* \u00a7\u00a7 94-95. Emphasis in the original.\n\n2.47.\n\nThe Tribunal does not dispute (nor did the Respondent) that if a corporate restructuring affecting a claimant\u2019s nationality was made in good faith before the occurrence of any event or measure giving rise to a later dispute, that restructuring should not be considered as an abuse of process.31 That is not, however, the issue in the present case, as the Tribunal explains below by reference to other reported cases.\n\nCertain decisions to this effect have been made subject to a dissenting opinion.\n\n2.48.\n\nThe Tribunal notes first the approach adopted by the tribunal in *Autopista v. Venezuela*,32 where a Mexican company restructured its investment in a Venezuelan company, Aucoven, by transferring 75 % of its shares to a US corporation. As in the present case, the respondent alleged that this restructuring was an abuse in order to gain access to ICSID jurisdiction. The tribunal noted that the US entity had been incorporated eight years before the parties had entered into their concession agreement; and that it was not a mere shell corporation. Thus, the tribunal concluded that the restructuring did not constitute \"an abuse of the Convention purposes.\"33\n\n*Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2001.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00a7 126.\n\n2.49.\n\nIn *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine,*34 the claimant was organised under Lithuanian law but was owned and controlled as to 99 % by Ukrainian nationals. The tribunal noted that this enterprise was formed many years before the BIT between Ukraine and Lithuania entered into force; and it concluded:\n\n*\"The Claimant manifestly did not create Tokios Tokel\u00e9s for the purpose of gaining access to ICSID arbitration under the BIT against Ukraine, as the enterprise was* *founded six years before the BIT... entered into force. Indeed, there is no evidence* *in the record that the Claimant used its formal legal nationality for any improper purpose.*\"35\n\nThe tribunal therefore concluded that there had been \"no abuse of legal personality.\"36\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2004, \u00a7\u00a7 53 to 56. This case did not involve a restructuration by a change of nationality to get access to ICSID jurisdiction, but an initial structuration permitting such access.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00a7 56.\n\n*Idem.* The President, Prosper Weil, strongly dissented, stating: \"The ICSID mechanism and remedy are not meant for investments made in a State by its own citizens with domestic capital through the channel of a foreign entity, whether pre-existent or created for that purpose.... Given the indisputable and undisputed Ukrainian character of the investment the Tribunal does not, in my view, give effect to the letter and spirit, as well as the object and purpose, of the ICSID institution.\" *Ibid.,* Dissenting Opinion, \u00a7 19 and \u00a7 20.\n\n2.50.\n\nIn *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia,*37 a Bolivian company had entered into a water concession contract with the Bolivian authorities. Bechtel, a US corporation, owned 55% of the shares in the Bolivian company, which were transferred to a Dutch company. The tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction was ostensibly derived from the Dutch-Bolivian BIT. Bolivia argued that the Dutch entity was a mere shell company created solely for the purpose of gaining access to ICSID and that, therefore, the tribunal had no jurisdiction under the BIT. The tribunal considered that the Dutch claimant was \"not simply a corporation shell established to obtain ICSID jurisdiction over the case.\"38 The tribunal explained the dividing line between abuse of process and legitimate restructuring even after the making of an investment:\n\n*\"... it is not uncommon in practice and - absent a particular limitation - not illegal to locate one\u2018s operation in a jurisdiction perceived to provide a beneficial regulatory and legal environment in terms, for example, of taxation or the substantive law of the jurisdiction, including the availability of a BIT.\"*39\n\n*Aguas del Tunari S.A. v. Republic of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 October 2005.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 321.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 330 (d).\n\n2.51.\n\nA statement to the same effect can be found in the *Mobil* decision, where the tribunal considered legitimate an \"upstream\" reorganization made in order to protect investments by gaining access to ICSID arbitration before any dispute, in contrast to an illegitimate \"downstream\" reorganization to the same effect with respect to a preexisting dispute:\n\n*\"As stated by the Claimants, the aim of the restructuring of their investments in Venezuela through a Dutch holding was to protect those investments against breaches of their rights by the Venezuelan authorities by gaining access to ICSID arbitration through the BIT. The Tribunal considers that this was a perfectly legitimate goal as far as it concerned*  *future disputes* *.*\n\n*With respect to**pre-existing disputes,**the situation is different and the Tribunal considers that to restructure investments only in order to gain jurisdiction under a BIT* *for such disputes would constitute, to take the words of the Phoenix Tribunal, \u2018an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs\u2018. The Claimants seem indeed to be conscious of this, when they state that they \"invoke ICSID jurisdiction on the basis of the consent expressed in the Treaty only for disputes arising under the Treaty for action that the Respondent took or continued to take after the restructuring was completed.\"*40\n\n*Mobil v. Venezuela*, *supra* note 27, \u00a7\u00a7 204-205. Emphasis added.\n\n2.52.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes from these and other legal materials submitted by the Parties that, in order to determine whether the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality was or was not an abuse of process, the Tribunal must first ascertain whether the relevant measure(s) or practice, which (as the Claimant allege) caused damage to its investments from March 2008 onwards, took place before or after the change in nationality on 13 December 2007. This approach in turn requires the Tribunal to ascertain the legal nature of the relevant measure(s) or practice alleged by the Claimant.\n\n2.53.\n\n***The Relevant Measure(s) or Practice:*** In order to identify these measures or practice, the Tribunal must necessarily analyse the Claimant\u2019s own pleadings. It will be recalled that the Tribunal decided, in its Decision of 2 August 2010, that the Notice of Intent was incorporated by reference into the Notice of Arbitration, and also to \"treat the Notice of Arbitration as amended in the manner requested by the Claimant.\"41 Accordingly, the Claimant\u2019s early pleadings include both the Notice of Intent and the Notice of Arbitration.\n\nDecision on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5, 2 August 2009, \u00a7 35.\n\n2.54.\n\nThe Notice of Intent pleads several alleged measures; and in the Notice of Arbitration, the same measures are pleaded. Starting with the Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial, the emphasis is increasingly placed by the Claimant on the alleged de facto ban publicly disclosed in President Saca\u2019s speech.\n\n2.55.\n\nAt this early stage, the Claimant based its pleaded case on the allegation that the Respondent had taken precise *measures* (in the plural) that improperly refused to grant to PRES an exploitation concession and to deliver to DOREX environmental permits. In its Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial, the Claimant alleged that the *measure* (in the singular) that had damaged its investments was the de facto ban announced by President Saca in March 2008, inter alia, as follows:\n\n*\"Respondent treats a December 2004 missed deadline by El Salvador\u2018s Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (\"MARN\") as if that were the sole or primary measure at issue. In fact, as is clear from Claimants Notice of Arbitration, the* *measure at issue is Respondent\u2018s de facto ban on mining operations, a practice which then-President Saca announced in March 2008.\"*42\n\n*\"The act supporting Pac Rim Cayman's claims of breach resulting in loss or damage is Respondent's de facto ban on mining as announced by President Saca in March 2008...\"*43\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 19.\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 376. Cited in \u00a7 11 of the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions.\n\n2.56.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Claimant\u2019s Opening Statement described \"the measure at issue\" (again in the singular) as follows: \"The practice of the Government not to grant any metallic mining application regardless of whether it satisfied all of the regulatory requirements.\"44\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Opening Statement, Hearing D1,160, with its Opening Power Point, Overview of Facts, p. 4.\n\n2.57.\n\nAt the end of the Hearing, the Claimant clarified its pleaded case in its Closing Statement, as follows:\n\n*\"... And it is true - and Respondent has really hit on this point over and over again over the course of these proceedings - it is true that we've sometimes referred to the individual acts and omissions that resulted in the denial of permits to PRES and DOREX as measures. We sometime used term \"measures\" to describe those acts and omissions. And they are, indeed, measures. That is an accurate way to describe those acts and omissions, but they're not the measure at issue, and I think that's a very important distinction to make. The measure at issue - and I really want to emphasize that phrase - \"the measure at issue\" - that is, the measure that is the basis for Claimant's articulation of breaches by Respondent of obligations on the international law plane is the practice of withholding mining-related permits. It is that measure that forms the basis of our claims...\"*45\n\nHearing D3,708-709.\n\n2.58.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimant\u2019s case was most clearly pleaded and explained during the Hearing. It therefore does not attach undue significance to its earlier written pleadings which might well be understood differently. The Tribunal understands the Claimant from its later pleadings as alleging that the measures described in its early pleadings formed only a factual pattern which derived from a then unstated practice of the Salvadoran Government, of which (as the Claimant alleges) the Claimant first became aware on 11 March 2008 with the report of President Saca\u2019s speech. Accordingly, the Tribunal treats the Claimant\u2019s pleaded case as alleging a practice by the Respondent which came to the Claimant\u2019s knowledge only with President Saca\u2019s reported speech in March 2008, which practice is alleged to consist of either a continuing or composite act in breach of CAFTA and for which the Claimant claims damages only from March 2008 onwards. The Tribunal accepts that a governmental practice, by definition, has necessarily to comprise a multiplicity of pre- or co-existing acts or omissions. It is necessary to ascertain the legal nature and timing of such a practice where a claimant\u2019s pleaded allegations are directed both at the acts or omissions themselves and to the practice comprising such acts or omissions, which practice only become known to a claimant at a later date.\n\n2.59.\n\nWhat then is the role of President Saca\u2019s speech as now alleged and explained by the Claimant in its pleadings? According to the Claimant, it was not by itself a measure, but it is what made public an alleged pre-existing governmental practice:\n\n*\"This is why President Saca\u2018s March 2008 public acknowledgment of the ban is so important. Claimant does not contend that the President\u2018s statement is by itself the measure at issue. But the President\u2018s statement did provide critical information, given the inherent difficulty in discerning the measure at issue, and as such may be seen as the consummation point of the administration\u2018s action and inaction constituting the offending measure at issue in this arbitration.\"*46\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7 238.\n\n2.60.\n\nFrom this and other explanations from the Claimant, it follows that, although the President\u2019s speech is not alleged to be a measure by itself, it is the point in time when, according to the Claimant, its dispute with the Respondent arose. It would be possible to use other language to describe the emergence of this dispute, as employed by both Parties in this case (e.g. \"born\", \"crystallised\" etc); but all these terms convey the same concept; and the Tribunal here prefers substance to semantics.\n\n2.61.\n\nHowever, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is necessary as a matter of international law (being applicable to the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA claims) to distinguish between President\u2019s Saca\u2019s speech as the alleged culminating point of a pre-existing practice and the effective beginning of a practice causing injury to the Claimant and its Enterprises. The Claimant\u2019s pleaded case was ambiguous on this point; particularly as to whether and (if so) when the alleged practice became a continuous act or a composite act by the Respondent.\n\n2.62.\n\nDuring the Hearing, the Tribunal understood the Claimant's case to include three alternative analyses of its alleged practice: (i) the speech of President Saca publicly launched a new policy, that did not exist before; (ii) the speech of President Saca acknowledged the existence of a practice analysed as a continuous act; and (iii) the speech of President Saca acknowledged the existence of a practice analysed as a composite act.\n\n2.63.\n\nAt the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal requested both the Claimant and the Respondent to comment on whether and (if so) when the alleged practice constituted a continuing act or a composite act, as those two terms are used in Articles 14 and 15, respectively, of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility of States (cited in the Annex to Part 1 above); and in particular whether the Claimant\u2019s pleaded claims were based on alleged conduct by the Respondent that pre-dated the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality on 13 December 2007.\n\n2.64.\n\nAccording to the Claimant\u2019s answer, the Tribunal did not need to characterise the relevant measure because the only important factor, according to the Claimant, was the existence of an unlawful situation which was applicable to the Claimant in March 2008, after 13 December 2007:\n\n*\"As for whether the ban is better described as a continuing measure or a composite* *measure, Claimant suggests that, like other tribunals confronted with similar fact* *patterns, this Tribunal need not choose. If the Tribunal finds that the measure at* *issue is conduct that did not cease to exist prior to CAFTA\u2018s becoming applicable to*  *Claimant, there is no need to label the measure.*\"47\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 23.\n\n2.65.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimant\u2019s response might be more appropriate for the Ratione Temporis issue; but that it is clearly inappropriate to this Abuse of Process issue. For this latter issue, it is important to ascertain whether the alleged measure began before and continued after the change in the Claimant\u2019s nationality. It here is necessary to apply first principles of international law.\n\n2.66.\n\nThe question of identifying precisely when an internationally wrongful act takes place is often a difficult factual question; it has important consequences on the law of international responsibility; and, as far as it concerns investment arbitration under a treaty, it can directly affect (as here) the exercise of jurisdiction by a tribunal.\n\n2.67.\n\nIn any particular case, three different situations can arise: (i) a measure is a \"onetime act\", that is an act completed at a precise moment, such as, for example, a nationalisation decree which is completed at the date of that decree; or (ii) it is a \"continuous\" act, which is the same act that continues as long as it is in violation of rules in force, such as a national law in violation of an international obligation of the State; or, (iii) it is a \"composite\" act, that is an act composed of other acts from which it is legally different. These important and well-established distinctions under customary international law are considered in the Commentaries of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.48\n\nDraft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, 2001, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 2001, vol II, Part Two [\"ILC Commentaries\"].\n\n2.68.\n\n*(i) One-Time Act:* As far as a one-time act is concerned, the ILC Commentaries explain both its instant realisation, at a precise moment in time, and the fact that it can have continuous effects:\n\n*\"The critical distinction for the purpose of article 14 is between a breach which is continuing and one which has already been completed. In accordance with paragraph 1, a completed act occurs \u2018at the moment when the act is performed\u2018, even though its effects or consequences may continue...\"*49\n\n*\"An act does not have a continuing character merely because its consequences extend in time.\"*50\n\nBased on such a definition, it is relatively easy to determine the moment when a measure takes place as a one-time act.\n\nILC Commentaries, p. 59.\n\nILC Commentaries, p. 60.\n\n2.69.\n\n*(ii) Continuous Act:* In contrast, a continuous act is the same act extending throughout a period of time, as also explained in the ILC Commentaries:\n\n*\"In accordance with paragraph 2, a continuing wrongful act, on the other hand, occupies the entire period during which the act continues and remains not in conformity with the international obligation, provided that the State is bound by the international obligation during that period.\"*51\n\nILC Commentaries, p. 60.\n\n2.70.\n\n*(iii) Composite Act:* Finally, a composite act is not the same, single act extending over a period of time, but is composed of a series of different acts that extend over that period; or, in other words, a composite act results from an aggregation of other acts and acquires a different legal characterisation from those other acts, as described in the ILC Commentaries:\n\n*\"Composite acts give rise to continuing breaches, which extend in time from the first of the actions or omissions in the series of acts making up the wrongful conduct.*\n\n*Composite acts covered by article 15 are limited to breaches of obligations which* *concern some aggregate of conduct and not individual acts as such. In other words,* *their focus is \u2018a series of acts or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful.\u2018\"*52\n\n*\"Only after a series of actions or omissions takes place will the composite act be* *revealed, not merely as a succession of isolated acts, but as a composite act, i.e. an*  *act defined in aggregate as wrongful.\"*53\n\nILC Commentaries, p. 62.\n\nILC Commentaries, p. 63.\n\n2.71.\n\nThe fact that a composite act is composed of acts that are legally different from the composite act itself means that the composite act can comprise legal acts and still be unlawful or that it can comprise unlawful acts violating certain norms which are different from the legal norm violated by the composite act. For example, several legal acts (of which each by itself is not unlawful) can become unlawful as the composite aggregation of those legal acts;54 or a series of unlawful acts interfering with an investment (which by themselves are not expropriatory) can by their aggregation result in an unlawful expropriation.\n\nThis type of composite act was referred to by the Claimant in its Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 30: \"A composite measure is a series of acts and omissions which, in the aggregate, constitute a breach of relevant obligations (even though individual acts or omissions on their own may not constitute such a breach). Such an analysis was performed by the tribunal in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale*, which referred to the concept of composite act and stated clearly that acts that are not illegal can become such by accumulation: \"While normally acts will take place at a given point in time independently of their continuing effects, and they might at that point be wrongful or not, it is conceivable also that there might be situations in which each act considered in isolation will not result in a breach of a treaty obligation, but if considered as a part of a series of acts leading in the same direction they could result in a breach at the end of the process of aggregation...\", *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. Dominican Republic,* LCIA Case No. UN7927, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008, \u00a7 91.\n\n2.72.\n\nWas the relevant measure in the present case, as alleged by the Claimant, a continuous act or a composite act? This is important, if the continuous or composite act extends over a critical date, here the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality on 13 December 2007.\n\n2.73.\n\nAs regards a continuing act, the ILC Commentaries state the following:\n\n\" *Thus, conduct which has commenced sometime in the past, and which constituted (or, if the relevant primary rule had been in force for the State at the time, would have constituted) a breach at that time, can continue and give rise to a continuing wrongful act in the present.\"*55\n\nIn this situation, the unlawful act only starts when the rule which this act violates is applicable.\n\nILC Commentaries, p. 61.\n\n2.74.\n\nAs regards a composite act, the ILC Commentaries state the following:\n\n*\"In cases where the relevant obligation did not exist at the beginning of the course of conduct but came into being thereafter, the \u2018first\u2018 of the actions or omissions of the series for the purposes of State responsibility will be the first occurring after the obligation came into existence.*56\n\n*Paragraph 1 of article 15 defines the time at which a composite act \u2018occurs\u2018 as the time at which the last action or omission occurs...\"*57\n\nIn this situation, the unlawful composite act is composed of aggregated acts and takes place at a time when the last of these acts occurs and violates (in aggregate) the applicable rule.\n\nILC Commentaries, p. 64.\n\nILC Commentaries, pp. 63-64.\n\n2.75.\n\n***Application to this Case:*** Having here set out the relevant general principles of international law, the Tribunal turns to the present case, as pleaded by the Claimant and disputed by the Respondent.\n\n2.76.\n\n***The Respondent's Submission*** *:* In summary, the Respondent submits that the relevant acts alleged by the Claimant were completed before the change in the Claimant\u2019s nationality on 13 December 2007:\n\n\" *In the present case, the measure at issue was exhausted when MARN did not respond to Claimant within the 60-day time period prescribed in the law. The presumed denial, denegaci\u00f3n presunta, of Claimant's application gave Claimant the opportunity to challenge the denial of the environmental permit. On the date that the 60-day period expired, the measure and its effects were consummated. Therefore the situation at the core of the present dispute, formed by all the acts and events described above, ceased to exist before CAFTA entered into force. The fact that Claimant's environmental permit was not granted is not the result of an omission from an ongoing obligation to act by the Government arising from Claimant's 2004 application.*\n\n*Indeed, Claimant could have resubmitted its application for an environmental permit after CAFTA entered into force. This could have generated another measure by MARN, either granting or denying the permit, which would be covered by the Treaty. But once the Government did not respond within the time period prescribed in the law concerning the 2004 application, and the presumed denial operated by law, the measure of which Claimant here complains, took place for purposes of CAFTA and the law of El Salvador. The fact that Claimant could resubmit its application is evidence that the alleged omission by MARN to respond to Claimant's application did not extend in time past the 60-day adjudication period, much less up to the entry into force of the Treaty.\"*58\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 317-318.\n\n2.77.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent contends that the relevant acts, measure, measures and other essential facts giving rise to the Parties\u2019 dispute all took place before 13 December 2007. The Respondent specifically alleges that: (i) with regard to the environmental permit, MARN did not meet the time limit established under Salvadoran law to either issue or deny the environmental permit by December 2004 (i.e. three years before the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality);59 and (ii) with regard to the exploitation concession filed with the Bureau of Mines, once the Bureau of Mines sent the two warning letters to the Claimant in October and December 2006 triggering the provisions of Article 38 of the Mining Law, that application was effectively terminated; nothing more could have been done by the Claimant after the expiration of the 30-day extension to revive it; and, therefore, such application should be treated as having been effectively terminated under the laws of the Respondent by January 2007 (i.e. one year before the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality).60\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 287.\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 194-196; the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7\u00a7 104-105.\n\n2.78.\n\n***The Claimant's Submission*** *:* In summary, the Claimant alleges that the relevant measure was the de facto mining ban consisting of a practice61 of withholding mining-related permits and concessions which only became public and known to the Claimant in March 2008 (with President Saca\u2019s speech); and which then wiped out the value of its mining investments and nullified its legitimate expectations and other protections under CAFTA, thereby giving rise to its present dispute with the Respondent.\n\nMeaning: \"a repeated or customary action; the usual way of doing something\": see the Claimant's PostHearing Submissions, \u00a7 14.\n\n2.79.\n\n***One-Time Acts:*** The Tribunal considers first whether the relevant measure or measures constitute one-time acts that were completed before the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality in December 2007. If this were the case, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it would follow on the particular facts of this case, that the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality would be an abuse of process by the Claimant. However, if the relevant one-time acts all took place after such change of nationality in or after March 2008, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it would follow on the particular facts of this case, that such change would not be an abuse of process. The Tribunal bears in mind that, in the case of one-time completed acts, the mere fact that earlier conduct has gone unremedied when a treaty enters into force does not justify a tribunal applying the treaty retrospectively to that conduct. Any other approach would subvert both the intertemporal principle in the law of treaties and the basic distinction between breach and reparation which underlies international law on State responsibility.62\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, \u00a7 70 [ *Mondev v. USA* ].\n\n2.80.\n\nOne factor supporting the Respondent\u2019s analysis is the Claimant\u2019s own early pleading of its case in the Notice of Intent, where almost all the references to acts (of which the Claimant there complains) take place before the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality. For example, there are references to earlier events \"in late 2005\" (\u00a7 18), \"(i)n March 2004 (\u00a7 19), \"in September 2004\u2019 (\u00a7 19), \"on August 2004\" (\u00a7 20), \"(i)n December 2004 (\u00a7 20), \"(b)etween March 2004 and December 2006\" (\u00a7 22), \"in December 2006\" (\u00a7 22), \"in December 2006\" (\u00a7 23), \"(i)n September 2005\" (\u00a7 25), \"on November 9, 2006 (\u00a7 27), \"(s)ince the end of 2006 (\u00a7 29), \"in or about January 2007\" (\u00a7 29), \"in 2007\" (\u00a7 30), \"in 2007\" (\u00a7 33), and \"other industries... have received environmental permits during the same time-frame that the Enterprises\u2019 applications have been pending.\" (\u00a7 35). The factual narrative pleaded in the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration concerning the El Dorado concession63 also focuses primarily on events before December 2007, whilst also expressing strong criticism of President Saca\u2019s speech in 2008. Although the Tribunal accepts the Claimant\u2019s subsequent explanation of these events as not being relevant measures, these remain alleged facts pre-dating the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality.\n\nA similar analysis can be made for the Exploration Licenses for Pueblos, Guaco, and Huacuco.\n\n2.81.\n\nWas the Claimant therefore aware from these facts of an actual or impending dispute with the Respondent before its change of nationality on 13 December 2007, as the Respondent contends? Again, it is necessary to turn to several passages in the Claimant\u2019s own pleading in the Notice of Intent:\n\n*\"Since the end of 2006, when indications arose that MARN was intent on delaying the Enterprises\u2018 activities, it has become increasingly apparent that these delay tactics were designed and implemented by the Government with the unlawfu1, discriminatory, and politically motivated aim of preventing their operations altogether.*\n\n*In addition to articulate the foregoing position, MARN also informed the Enterprises in 2007 that, prior to the Ministry granting any environmental permits, MARN would need to conduct a \"country-wide strategic environmental study...\"64*\n\n*\"... representatives of the companies participated in both public and private meetings with various members of the Government throughout the year [this is a reference to the year 2007], during which they objected to the Government\u2018s newfound positions...\"65*\n\n*\"The Government\u2018s nascent opposition to the Enterprises\u2018 operations was first manifested by MARN in late 2005, when it began delaying its responses to their applications for environmental permits without explanation. Soon thereafter, it began* *to arbitrarily change or add new requirements to the established legal process for obtaining such permits.\"66*\n\nNotice of Intent, \u00a7 29.\n\nNotice of Intent, \u00a7 31.\n\nNotice of Intent, \u00a7 18.\n\n2.82.\n\nFrom these early pleadings, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant was here alleging a known opposition to its interests by the Salvadoran Government by 2005; and it had already objected to the conduct of the Salvadoran authorities as to the nongranting of new mining permits by 2007, before its change of nationality one year later. If the matter rested there, the Tribunal would be minded to accept the submissions of the Respondent; but for the Claimant\u2019s subsequent clarification of its pleaded case.\n\n2.83.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken particular note of the Claimant\u2019s belief that it received indications from the Salvadoran authorities, to the effect that the different permits and authorisations could yet be granted to its Enterprises. According to the Claimant, even if there were theoretical legal circumstances under which a government agency\u2019s failure to meet a statutory deadline could give rise to a dispute between an investor and the Respondent, the conduct in this particular case of MARN, the Bureau of Mines and other government officials led the Claimant reasonably to understand that even though deadlines had been missed by these authorities, PRES's applications for a permit and a concession remained under consideration by the Salvadoran authorities.67 Therefore, so the Claimant contends, having induced it to understand that despite the missed deadlines in 2004 or 2007 there was no dispute between the Parties, the Respondent is now effectively precluded, as a matter of law, from here arguing that the missed deadlines triggered the present dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent before December 2007.68\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 93-127.\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 268-276; Hearing Day 1,223-225.\n\n2.84.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Claimant\u2019s submissions. It also notes that, even after March 2008, there were discussions between the Claimant and the Salvadoran authorities. In the Notice of Intent, it was specifically pleaded that: \"(i)n 2008, President Elias Antonio Saca was reported as having publicly stated that he opposed the granting of any outstanding mining permits. In light of President Saca\u2019s comments and the Government\u2019s actions and inactions, the Enterprises engaged in several meetings with the Government in 2008 seeking approval of the necessary permits.\"69 Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the alleged omission to grant a permit and concession was not completely finalised before 13 December 2007, because even at that time there still seemed to be a reasonable possibility, as understood by the Claimant, to receive such permit and concession notwithstanding the passage of time.\n\nNotice of Intent, \u00a7 32.\n\n2.85.\n\nIn conclusion, taking stock of all the evidential materials adduced before the Tribunal and the several submissions from both the Claimant and the Respondent, the Tribunal concludes that: (i) before 13 December 2007, the Claimant was aware of difficulties in obtaining the permit and concession; (ii) discussions with Salvadoran authorities to resolve those difficulties extended at least until mid-2008, after President Saca\u2019s speech; (iii) exchanges between the Claimant and the Salvadoran authorities, involving the latter\u2019s request for further information after the legal date which (as the Respondent alleges) constituted the legal termination of administrative proceed-ings,70 suggest that the door was not closed to the Claimant before 13 December 2007; and (iv) the fact that, differing from other similar requests,71 no formal decision was taken by the Respondent terminating such proceedings likewise suggests that these proceedings were still live at the beginning of 2008.72 In addition, as already explained by this Tribunal, the Claimant has unequivocally pleaded later in these proceedings (after the Notice of Arbitration but at least from its CounterMemorial onwards) that the relevant measure does not comprise one or more of the individual acts taken by MARN and MINEC, but the alleged de facto ban or practice by the Respondent that was not made public before the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality on 13 December 2007.\n\nSee the letter from MINEC to PRES dated 4 December 2006, and the letter from MARN to PRES issued exactly two years after (4 December 2008), evidencing in both cases that at the time of such letters the proceedings were still not terminated.\n\nSee the Tribunal's question at the Hearing (D3,559, lines 7/22 and 560, line 1) and the Respondent's answer (at D3,614, lines 13/22), referring to the fact that besides Pacific Rim Mining Corp there was only one other Exploitation Concession Application (of another company whose name counsel at that time did not know), which was filed in 2005 and rejected by the Ministry of Economy in 2006. See also the references made in \u00a7\u00a7 62 and 64 of the *Commerce Group* award indicating that in other cases MARN and the Ministry of Economy terminated environmental permits and denied the extension of licenses applications.\n\nSee Mr Shrake\u2019s Witness Statement, \u00a7\u00a7 101, 118, 119 and 120. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent did not produce any evidence (by means of witness statements or otherwise) expressly contradicting the existence and content of the conversations and meetings adduced by the Claimant.\n\n2.86.\n\nAccordingly, treating the relevant measure pleaded by the Claimant as an alleged practice constituting a one-off act under international law, the Tribunal could consider that the Parties\u2019 dispute arose in March 2008, at the earliest. On this analysis, therefore, the Tribunal would not consider that the relevant measure alleged by the Claimant comprised one or more one-time acts completed before the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality on 13 December 2007. However, it is impossible for the Tribunal to characterise this alleged practice, necessarily comprising several acts and omissions, as a one-off act; and the Tribunal here declines to do so.\n\n2.87.\n\n***Composite Act:*** As already described above, the Claimant pleaded its relevant measure as a composite act. The Tribunal considers that the existence of the de facto ban or practice, as alleged by the Claimant, necessarily extends both before and after the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality in December 2007; and, therefore, the Tribunal is next required to analyse whether the alleged ban could be a composite act under international law. If the Tribunal were to determine that the ban was a composite act, only the component acts which occurred after the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality on 13 December 2007 could be treated by the Tribunal as possibly engaging the responsibility of the Respondent under CAFTA.\n\n2.88.\n\nAs no relevant act was pleaded by the Claimant occurring after the change of nationality that could be a component part of the alleged practice only publicly disclosed in March 2008, it is impossible, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, to characterise the ban as a different legal animal from the several acts that comprise it, i.e. as a composite act. That ban was described by the Claimant as: \"(t)he practice of the Government not to grant any metallic mining application\" derived from the facts that the Government did not grant environmental permits to DOREX and did not grant a concession exploitation to PRES, which occurred before the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality in December 2007. These are similar acts the aggregation of which does not produce a different composite act under international law. The Tribunal therefore rejects the de facto ban, as pleaded by the Claimant, as a composite act.\n\n2.89.\n\n***Continuous Act:*** Can the alleged practice be characterised as a continuous act, as also pleaded by the Claimant? If the Tribunal were to determine that there was a continuous act in this case, only that portion of the continuous act taking place after the change of nationality on 13 December 2007 could be considered by the Tribunal for the purpose of engaging possible responsibility by the Respondent under CAFTA.\n\n2.90.\n\nAs regards this question, the Claimant explained that:\n\n*\"... (w)hile the ban may have come into existence at some earlier point in time, it continued to exist after Pac Rim Cayman acquired its U.S. nationality in December 2007, which is when CAFTA became applicable to measures relating to Pac Rim Cayman.\"*73\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 4.\n\n2.91.\n\nThe Tribunal also bears in mind that the Claimant pleads that the alleged unlawful practice by the Respondent is a negative practice not to grant any mining application, i.e. it allegedly comprises omissions to act and not positive acts; and that, consequently, it is difficult to give a precise date for such omissions (compared to a specific positive act). Once an act takes place, it affects the parties\u2019 legal position; but, in contrast, an omission to act does not necessarily affect the parties as long as it is not definitive; and an omission can remain non-definitive throughout a period during which it could be cured by a positive act. As determined above by the Tribunal, although there were deadlines fixed under Salvadoran law for the granting of the permits and the concession, the Claimant understood that the Salvadoran authorities themselves did not treat these deadlines as definitive deadlines after which permits or concessions could no longer be granted to the Claimant at all.\n\n2.92.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, on the particular facts of this case as pleaded by the Claimant, an omission that extends over a period of time and which, to the reasonable understanding of the relevant party, did not seem definitive should be considered as a continuous act under international law. The legal nature of the omission did not change over time: the permits and the concession remained non-granted. The controversy began with a problem over the non-granting of the permits and concession; and it remained a controversy over a practice of not granting the mining permits and concession.\n\n2.93.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this same general approach was adopted for the omission to pay a debt (which omission lasts as long as the debt remains unpaid) in *SGS v. Philippines,* where the tribunal decided that:... the failure to pay sums due under a con tract is an example of a continuing breach.\"74 A similar analysis was made by the tribunal in *African Holding:*\n\n*\"The Tribunal concludes in this regard that the nature of the dispute concerned the fact that the work had been performed under a contract and that their cost had not been paid during a lengthy period of more than fifteen years. That the DRC officially refused to pay or kept silent is unimportant for the nature of the dispute. The fact is that the DRC defaulted in its obligations under the terms of the contract, to which is therefore attached a situation of non-performance envisaged by Article 7.1.1 of the UNIDROIT Principles. Under this same article, non-performance includes defective or late performance. Moreover, the fact that the DRC offered to renegotiate the debts and to pay only a fraction of their value cannot be considered the same as an official refusal. Even if the DRC had agreed to pay, and did not in fact pay, the nature of the dispute would still remain the same: before as well as after the critical date, the amount for the work performed was not paid.*\"75\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

Que la RDC ait officiellement refus\u00e9 de payer ou ait gard\u00e9 le silence, est sans importance pour la nature du diff\u00e9rend. Le fait est que la RDC a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ses obligations aux termes du contrat, ce qui se rattache donc \u00e0 une situation d\u2019inex\u00e9cution envisag\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 7.1.1 des Principes d\u2019UNIDROIT. Aux termes de ce m\u00eame article, l\u2019inex\u00e9cution comprend l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u00e9fectueuse ou tardive.

This question touches not only upon the Abuse of Process issue, but also the Ratione Temporis issue; and it is here helpful to address these issues together to contrast their differences.\n\n2.96.\n\n***Abuse of Process*** *:* The Tribunal first considers the point in time when a change of nationality can become an abuse of process. Several different answers were suggested by the Parties as the crucial dividing-line: (i) where facts at the root of a later dispute have already taken place and that future dispute is foreseen or reasonably foreseeable; (ii) where facts have taken place giving rise to an actual dispute; and (iii) where facts have taken place giving rise to an actual dispute referable under the parties\u2019 relevant arbitration agreement.\n\n2.97.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with the last of these three suggested answers, as submitted by the Claimant during the Hearing:\n\n*\"...the temporal determination for abuse of process purposes must be made on the* *basis of evaluating what concrete acts were taken by the Party asserting jurisdiction to invoke the instrument on which it intends to base its consent and under which it* *intends to assert its claims.\"76*\n\nHearing D3,744.\n\n2.98.\n\nThe Respondent contested this dividing-line as far too late and also as an absurd logical impossibility:\n\n*\"As El Salvador indicated at the hearing, under this standard there could never be abuse of process for change of nationality because the jurisdictional instrument relied on by a claimant committing an abuse cannot be invoked until after the putative claimant changes nationality. This guarantees that the moment of the \u2018temporal determination' would always be after the change of nationality and the* *change could thus never be abusive.\"*77\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 46.\n\n2.99.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the force of the Respondent\u2019s submission; and it therefore rejects this third suggested answer. As far as the two other suggested answers are concerned, the Tribunal considers that they can be examined together for the purpose of this case. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the dividing-line occurs when the relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific future dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a possible controversy. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, before that dividing-line is reached, there will be ordinarily no abuse of process; but after that dividing-line is passed, there ordinarily will be. The answer in each case will, however, depend upon its particular facts and circumstances, as in this case. As already indicated above, the Tribunal is here more concerned with substance than semantics; and it recognises that, as a matter of practical reality, this dividing-line will rarely be a thin red line, but will include a significant grey area.\n\n2.100.\n\nTo this extent, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s general submission that: \"... it is clearly an abuse for an investor to manipulate the nationality of a shell company subsidiary to gain jurisdiction under an international treaty at a time when the investor is aware that events have occurred that negatively affect its investment and may lead to arbitration.\"78 In particular, abuse of process must preclude unacceptable manipulations by a claimant acting in bad faith and fully aware of an existing or future dispute, as also submitted by the Respondent:\n\n*\"...In addition, the investor has substantial control over the stages of the development of the dispute [as described in Maffezini]. Because it is the investor who must express disagreement with a government action or omission and the investor who must formulate legal claims, the investor may delay the development of the dispute into these later stages until it has completed the manipulative change of nationality. Relying on this test would permit an investor that is fully aware of a dispute to create access to jurisdiction under a treaty to which it was not entitled at the time of the actions affecting the investment, and at the same time provide no protection to the State from this abusive behaviour.\"*79\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 49. Emphasis by the Respondent.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 50.\n\n2.101.\n\n***Ratione Temporis:*** The Tribunal considers that this approach as regards the Abuse of Process issue is materially different from the approach applicable to the Ratione Temporis issue, where both Parties relied on the general principle of nonretroactivity for the interpretation and application of international treaties.\n\n2.102.\n\nThe Claimant submitted as follows in its Post-Hearing Submissions: \"Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis depends on whether the measure at issue is an act or fact that took place or a situation that continued to exist after CAFTA became applicable to Claimant.\"80 The Respondent shared this analysis, here cited (for example) from its Jurisdiction Reply: \"The relevant issue [for jurisdiction ratione temporis] is the date on which the measure, act, or fact that constitutes the alleged breach took place.\"81 There is here no reference to a claimant\u2019s knowledge or awareness of an alleged breach or present or future dispute.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 8.\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00a7 191.\n\n2.103.\n\nThe general principle of non-retroactivity in the law of international treaties, unless there is a specific indication to the contrary, is well established. This principle is embodied in CAFTA\u2019s Article 10.1 (cited in the Annex to Part 1 above). It is codified in Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which provides: \"Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.\" In its 1966 Commentaries to the Draft Articles of the Law of Treaties, the International Law Commission stated: \"There is nothing to prevent the parties from giving a treaty, or some of its provisions, retroactive effect if they think fit. It is essentially a question of their intention. The general rule however is that a treaty is not to be treated as intended to have retroactive effects unless such an intention is expressed in the treaty or was clearly to be implied from its terms.\"82 It would be possible to add to these legal materials; but it is unnecessary to do so given that this general principle is not materially disputed by the Parties.\n\nYearbook of the International Law Commission, 1966, Vol. II, p. 211.\n\n2.104.\n\nWhere there is an alleged practice characterised as a continuous act (as determined above by the Tribunal) which began before 13 December 2007 and continued thereafter, this Tribunal would have jurisdiction ratione temporis over that portion of the continuous act that lasted after that date, regardless of events or knowledge by the Claimant before 13 December 2007. The Tribunal concludes that this solution is different from that reached in its analysis of the Abuse of Process issue, as here explained.\n\n2.105.\n\nHaving reached these several conclusions, the Tribunal turns to the question whether, as regards the Ratione Temporis issue, all factual materials before 13 December 2007 are irrelevant to the Claimant\u2019s pleaded case in regard to the alleged practice as a continuous act causing injury from March 2008 only? The Tribunal considers that such materials could still be received as evidence of the factual background to the Parties\u2019 dispute, as was stated in *Mondev* (when discussing substantive standards under NAFTA Chapter 11):\n\n*\"...events or conduct prior to the entry into force of an obligation for the respondent State may be relevant in determining whether the State has subsequently committed a breach of the obligation. But it must still be possible to point to conduct of the State after that date which is itself a breach.\"*83\n\nAs in *Mondev,* the Tribunal determines that it could remain appropriate for the Claimant to point to the conduct of the Respondent before 13 December 2007. This same approach was adopted by the *MCI* tribunal, which did not dismiss acts and omissions completed before the treaty\u2019s entry into force as irrelevant. It decided that such acts and omissions may be considered: \"for purposes of understanding the background, the causes, or scope of violations of the BIT that occurred after its entry into force.\"84\n\n*Mondev v. USA*, *supra* note 62, \u00a7 69.\n\n*M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Award, 31 July 2007, \u00a7 62.\n\n2.106.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal decides that for jurisdiction to exist under CAFTA in the present case ratione temporis, there must be a dispute between the Parties after the application of CAFTA to the Claimant consequent upon its change of nationality on 13 December 2007, based on a continuous act or measure that existed after such date.\n\n2.107.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the relevant date for deciding upon the Abuse of Process issue must necessarily be earlier in time than the date for deciding the Ratione Tempo-ris issue. Where the alleged practice is a continuous act (as concluded above by the Tribunal), this means that the practice started before the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality and continued after such change. This analysis would found the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction ratione temporis under CAFTA; but it would preclude the exercise of such jurisdiction on the basis of abuse of process if the Claimant had changed its nationality during that continuous practice knowing of an actual or specific future dispute, thus manipulating the process under CAFTA and the ICSID Convention in bad faith to gain unwarranted access to international arbitration.\n\n2.108.\n\nAt this point, it is necessary to return again to the Claimant\u2019s pleading at the Hearing, to the effect that it was only claiming compensation for the period from March 2008 onwards, in the words of its counsel:\n\n*\"...let me be very clear: with respect to our claim for damages, we are only asking for damages as a result of the breach that we became aware of and that we only could have become aware of in - as of March 2008 at the earliest...*\n\n*... let me just emphasize in response to the Tribunal's question as to whether the measure at issue is the same for the CAFTA claims and the Investment Law claims, it is. In both cases the measure at issue is the de facto mining ban. Also, as I said earlier, in both cases, Claimant is alleging damages only from the period from March 2008 forward and not from any earlier period.\"*85\n\nHearing D3. 719 & 729 (see also D3,701).\n\n2.109.\n\nAs unequivocally explained at the Hearing on several occasions, the Claimant\u2019s alleged measure, the de facto ban forming the legal and factual basis pleaded for its CAFTA claims, must be understood by the Tribunal as a continuous act relevant for the Claimant\u2019s claims for compensation from March 2008 onwards (not before); that, as such, it became known to the Claimant only from the public report of President Saca\u2019s speech on 11 March 2008; and that, also as such, it was not known to or foreseen by the Claimant before 13 December 2007 as an actual or specific future dispute with the Respondent under CAFTA.\n\n***(08) Decisions***\n--------------------\n\n2.110.\n\nFor these reasons, in the circumstances of the present case, taking into particular consideration the Claimant\u2019s claims as finally pleaded and explained to this Tribunal, the Tribunal determines that the change in the Claimant\u2019s nationality on 13 December 2007, on all the evidential materials adduced by the Parties in these proceedings, is not proven to have been an abuse of process precluding the exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to determine such claims under CAFTA and the ICSID Convention; and the Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent\u2019s case on the Abuse of Process issue.\n\n2.111.\n\nThis determination, together with the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the Denial of Benefits issue later in Part 4 of this Decision, renders it unnecessary for the Tribunal to address other factors raised by the Parties in regard to the Abuse of Process issue. It should not be assumed from its silence here that, if relevant, the Tribunal was minded to decide any of these further factors one way or another. However, the Tribunal considers that the Abuse of Process issue does not apply to the Claimant\u2019s claims under the Investment Law which are not made under CAFTA and made with an independent right to invoke ICSID Arbitration.\n\n***PART 3: ISSUE B - RATIONE TEMPORIS***\n----------------------------------------\n\n***(01) Introduction***\n-----------------------\n\n3.1.\n\nThis Ratione Temporis issue under CAFTA formed a relatively limited part of the jurisdictional debate between the Parties; it has already been addressed in material part by the Tribunal in Part 2 above (in regard to the Abuse of Process issue); and, as appears later in this Decision, it is not decisive of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in regard to the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA claims. In these circumstances, the Tribunal addresses this issue shortly, again as a matter of courtesy to the Parties.\n\n3.2.\n\nIt is nonetheless necessary to summarise the Parties\u2019 respective submissions on this issue, which, to a significant extent, mirrors certain of their submissions made on the Abuse of Process issue. The summaries below therefore inevitably duplicate earlier submissions in Part 2 of this Decision, which the Tribunal has there already decided.\n\n***(02) The Respondent's Case***\n--------------------------------\n\n3.3.\n\nAs an alternative and subsidiary objection to its case on the Abuse of Process and Denial of Benefits issues, the Respondent contended that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis due to the fact, principally, that the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality on 13 December 2007 occurred after the relevant measure or measures leading to the Parties\u2019 present dispute.86\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 8; Hearing D1,107; and the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearings Submissions, \u00a7 102.\n\n3.4.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent submits that in order to be considered as an investor under CAFTA Article 10.28, an enterprise has first to be a national or an enterprise of a Party, and as such the enterprise has to attempt to make, be making or have made an investment in the territory of another Party. As the Claimant became an enterprise of a Party only on 13 December 2007, all transactions in which it may have been involved before that date were not made as an investor under CAFTA.87\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 256-257; Hearing D1,107-111.\n\n3.5.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the provisions of CAFTA Chapter 10, including the dispute settlement provisions, can only apply after CAFTA entered into force for the USA and the Respondent on 1 March 2006; and as the Claimant did not become a national of the USA until 13 December 2007, CAFTA protections and benefits could only have been available to the Claimant after 13 December 2007.88\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 264-274 and 297-304, \u00a7185; Hearing D1,111-114; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearings Submissions, \u00a7 102.\n\n3.6.\n\nAs a result of these undisputed facts, the Respondent concludes that: (i) CAFTA could only cover investments made by the Claimant as a covered investor after 13 December 2007; and that there were no such investments;89 (ii) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over disputes based on any relevant measure that took place before 13 December 2007; and all relevant measures took place before 13 December 2007;90 and, in any case, (iii) CAFTA imposes a three-year time limit to bring CAFTA claims that should be counted from the time the Claimant knew or should have known of the alleged breach and that damage had occurred caused by such breach; and these CAFTA proceedings began after the expiry of that limitation period: the Respondent submits that, taking 2004 as the commencement date (the expiration of environmental permit statutorily mandated period) or 1 March 2006 (when CAFTA entered into force), the Claimant did not file its Notice of Arbitration within three years of either of those commencement dates.91\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 260-263; Reply Memorial, \u00a7 186.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 275-279; Reply Memorial, \u00a7 187.

According to the Respondent, if this breach date occurred prior to the acquisition of CAFTA nationality by the Claimant, it necessarily follows that there can be no jurisdiction for the Tribunal to decide the merits of the Claimant\u2019s claims under CAFTA..92\n\nReply Memorial, \u00a7 191; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearings Submissions, \u00a7 103.\n\n3.8.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the relevant measure giving rise to the Parties\u2019 dispute took place before 13 December 2007. It alleges that: (i) with regard to the environmental permit, MARN did not meet the time-limit established under Salvadoran law to either issue or deny the environmental permit by December 2004,93 and (ii) with regard to the application for the exploitation concession filed with the Bureau of Mines, once the Bureau of Mines sent the two warning letters to PRES in October and December 2006 triggering the provisions of Article 38 of the Mining Law, the application was effectively terminated; and nothing more could have been done after the expiration of the 30-day extension thereby granted to revive its application. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the application should be treated as having been effectively terminated by January 2007.94\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 287.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 194-196; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearings Submissions, \u00a7\u00a7 104-105.\n\n3.9.\n\nWith respect to the requirement to submit evidence of ownership or authorisation to use the surface area of the concession, the Respondent contends that it did not have any legal duty or obligation to change its laws in favour of the Claimant\u2019s application and, therefore, that there was no breach of CAFTA or any other legal obligation towards the Claimant. In any case, all the attempts to change the law in order to accommodate the Claimant\u2019s interests took place in 2005 and 2006, followed by Claimant\u2019s attempt to procure a new law in 2007.95\n\nReply Memorial, \u00a7 197.\n\n3.10.\n\nConcerning the Claimant\u2019s allegation that the relevant measure is a de facto ban occurring in March 2008 with President Saca\u2019s speech or constitutes a continuing or composite act that was only apparent to the Claimant from that speech in March 2008, the Respondent submits that press reports of President Saca\u2019s statements does not constitute a measure96 and that not issuing the environmental permit and not granting the concession application are not the result of several omissions or a continued omission by the Respondent; nor can these constitute a composite act because there was only one application for an environmental permit and only one omission to issue it (which occurred in December 2004) and only one application for an exploitation concession that was effectively terminated by January 2007.97\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 321-323.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 305-319; Reply Memorial, \u00a7 201; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 106.\n\n3.11.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that such statements by the Respondent were not new. Press reports in July 2006 and June 2007 contained similar concerns expressed by the Respondent\u2019s Ministers of Environment Barrera and Guerrero with respect to mining and possible changes to existing legislation for exploitation concessions, respectively.98\n\nReply Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 205-206, citing R-120 and R-121.\n\n3.12.\n\nMoreover, according to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to identify the date of the relevant measure at issue. Instead, it has identified only when it allegedly \"became aware\" of the relevant measure; and this insufficient response cannot assist the Claimant\u2019s argument that there is a relevant measure covered by CAFTA that occurred after the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality, over which CAFTA could apply and by which this Tribunal could assert jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA claims. The Respondent concludes that there is no such relevant measure.99\n\nHearing, D3,709-719; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 105.\n\n3.13.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the loss of value in Pac Rim\u2019s stock was not caused by the press reports regarding President Saca's statement, but co-incided with the worldwide decline in stock values in 2008 and mirrored the significant drop in the values of other gold stocks.100 The reason why this Canadian parent company\u2019s stock price never recovered was because it suspended drilling activities and began to make work-force reductions in El Salvador.101\n\nReply Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 209-210; Hearing D1,115.\n\nHearing D1,116-117; and the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 20.\n\n3.14.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the present case should be distinguished from other cases, such as *RDC v. Guatemala,* because in that case there was an executive act affecting the investment after CAFTA entered into force. The Respondent also contends that although a \"practice\" could be considered a measure, the timing of that measure must depend on the specific acts that are alleged to form part of that \"practice.\" In the present case, according to the Respondent, such acts took place in 2004 and were in any event completed by January 2007.102\n\nReply Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 213-216.\n\n3.15.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant\u2019s allegation that exchanges before December 2007 between MARN and MINEC and the Claimant evidenced a \"mere disagreement\" and not a dispute for the purpose of CAFTA, the Respondent submits that the definition of a dispute set forth by the Permanent Court of International Justice in *Ma-vrommatis Palestine Concessions* (adopted by ICSID tribunals) defines a dispute as a \"disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between two persons.\" As such a disagreement existed between 2004 and 2006 before the Respondent\u2019s accession to CAFTA, the Claimant\u2019s contrary case should be rejected by the Tribunal.103\n\nReply Memorial, \u00a7 218.\n\n3.16.\n\nAs regards CAFTA\u2019s limitation period, CAFTA Article 10.18.1 limits consent to submit a claim to arbitration to three years from the date when the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach of CAFTA and that the claimant or the enterprise had thereby incurred loss or damage. The Respondent submits that the evidential materials before this Tribunal demonstrate that the Claimant knew in December 2004 that the environmental permit was not issued within the time-limit fixed by Salvadoran law; and that, even on the argument that the three-year term could only count from the date CAFTA entered into force for the Respondent (on 1 March 2006), the Claimant did not file its Notice of Arbitration until 30 April 2009, after CAFTA\u2019s three-year time limit had expired.104\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 324-336; Reply Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 220-223; Hearing D1,117-119; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearings Submissions, \u00a7 112.\n\n3.17.\n\nLastly, the Respondent relies on the award dated 14 March 2011 in *Commerce Group*,105 whereby, according to the Respondent, that tribunal considered the same factual allegations advanced by the Claimant in this case and decided that the alleged de facto ban on mining was not a relevant measure for the purposes of CAFTA..106\n\n*Commerce Group Corp. and San Sebastian Gold Mines, Inc. v.

The Claimant submits that it neither became nor could have become aware of the relevant measure (in the form of the de facto ban on mining) before 13 March 2008 when President Saca publicly disclosed the existence of this ban. In the Claimant\u2019s own words: \"it is the ban, as first publicly confirmed by El Salvador's chief executive in March 2008, that wiped out the prospect of Claimant being able to derive value from its investments, thus rendering those investments worthless.\"109\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7 231; Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 193; and the Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 5.\n\n3.21.\n\nIn the Claimant's submission, although the delays and irregularities by the Respondent in the application of Salvadoran law provide valuable historical context for understanding the Respondent\u2019s CAFTA breaches and constitute further evidence and factual bases for the Claimant\u2019s claims under CAFTA, they do not in themselves constitute the relevant measure alleged by the Claimant to have breached the Respondent\u2019s CAFTA obligations.110\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7195.\n\n3.22.\n\nFor the Claimant, the acts and omissions of the Respondent occurring prior to 2008 are not the measures at issue in this arbitration. Rather, they were only individual instances where MARN or MINEC failed to issue permits or concessions in a timely manner which may have caused delay, but which did not, in contrast to the de facto mining ban, wipe out the value of the Claimant's mining investments nor nullify its legitimate expectations under CAFTA, giving rise to the present dispute.\n\n3.23.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"prior to the ban's coming to light, the frustration of individual acts or omissions causing delay was dissipated by statements and acts of Government officials consistent with steady (albeit slow) progress towards the goal of being able to extract the minerals PRES and DOREX had discovered during the exploration phase of the investment.\"111\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7 232.\n\n3.24.\n\nIn the Claimant's submission, there was in place in El Salvador a practice of withholding mining-related permits and concessions; and that such a practice - already in existence for some indeterminate period of time while the Respondent was to decide what the future of metallic mining in El Salvador was to be - was never revealed in the laws, regulations and representations by the Government on which the Claimant relied in making and expanding its investments in El Salvador. According to the Claimant, it came to light only in March 2008 when President Saca publicly acknowledged its existence.112\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7 244.\n\n3.25.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the de facto mining ban constitutes the breach of CAFTA pleaded by the Claimant; and, accordingly, the relevant date on which Claimant first knew or should have known that the ban had been implemented by the Respondent, causing loss to the Claimant, was March 2008.113 According to the Claimant, the significance of President Saca\u2019s revelation in March 2008 is illustrated by the impact on the share price of the Claimant\u2019s parent company (Pacific Rim), which dropped precipitously upon the President\u2019s announcement of the alleged de facto mining ban and has never since recovered, a pattern materially different from other gold stocks.114\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7 236.\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 249-251.\n\n3.26.\n\nThe Claimant contends that President Saca's speech in March 2008 may have marked either the actual imposition of the ban or confirmed a practice that pre-dated his announcement. In any case, that ban, as it relates to the Claimant, is a measure covered by CAFTA. In the first case, it would be a measure that took place both after CAFTA's entry into force in March 2006 and the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality in December 2007. In the second case, it would be a continuing practice that continued both after CAFTA's entry into force and the Claimant's change of nationality. Moreover, in this last case, the Claimant submits that the de facto ban should be considered as a continuing or composite measure,115 as distinct from a completed act with continuing effects.116\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7\u00a7 29-31.\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memoriall, \u00a7 224-244; Hearing D1,221-223.\n\n3.27.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, acts and omissions that occurred before December 2007 should only be taken into account by this Tribunal \"for purposes of understanding the background, the causes or scope of the violations of CAFTA that occurred after entry into force.\"117\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submissions \u00a7 21, citing *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. Dominican Republic*, LCIA Case No. UN 7927, Award on Preliminary Objections on Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008, \u00a7 87.\n\n3.28.\n\nWith respect to the difference between a dispute and a mere disagreement drawn by the Respondent, the Claimant submits that, although every dispute involves a disagreement, it is not true that every disagreement constitutes a dispute. In the Claimant's submission, the Respondent\u2019s case is not supported by the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* case, nor is it the correct interpretation of CAFTA. According to the Claimant, for there to be a dispute under CAFTA, there must be an allegation of a breach of an obligation under CAFTA and an allegation of loss or damage by reason of or arising out of that breach.118\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 260-267.\n\n3.29.\n\nAlso according to the Claimant, even if there were some theoretical circumstances under which a government agency's failure to meet a statutory deadline might automatically give rise to a treaty dispute between an investor and the government, the conduct of MARN, the Bureau of Mines and other government officials led the Claimant reasonably to understand that even though deadlines had been missed, PRES's applications for a permit and a concession remained under active consideration by these agencies.119 Therefore, having induced the Claimant to understand that despite the missed deadlines in 2004 or 2007 there was no dispute, the Respondent is now precluded, as a matter of law, from arguing that the missed deadlines triggered the present dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent.120\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 93-127.\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 268-276; Hearing D1,223-225.\n\n3.30.\n\nWith respect to the decision in *Commerce Group*, the Claimant submits that its circumstances differ significantly from this case. Whilst the *Commerce Group* case was about the Respondent\u2019s revocation of environmental permits previously granted, the present case relates only to a de facto ban.121 The claim in this other case was dismissed by the tribunal on the basis that the claimant had challenged the revocation before the local courts and had failed to terminate such local court action, even after it had submitted its claims to arbitration under CAFTA, in violation of its waiver obligation under CAFTA Article 10.18. That being that the principal factor for the tribunal\u2019s decision, the tribunal\u2019s reference (in paragraph 112 of its award) to a policy that led to the revocation should be considered, according to the Claimant, as mere obiter dicta.122\n\nHearing D1,228-234; and the Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7\u00a7 13-15.\n\nHearing D1,228-234; and the Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 16.\n\n***(04) The Tribunal's Analysis and Decisions***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n3.31.\n\nThe Tribunal determines that the relevant questions to be addressed under this issue are: (i) whether, in order to be an investor making an investment under CAFTA Article 10.28, an enterprise has already to be a national or an enterprise of a Party or if such nationality can be acquired after the investment has been made; (ii) what is the relevant measure and which date should be considered as the date of the measure for the purpose of this issue; and (iii) the relevance to be given by the Tribunal, if any, to the recent award in the *Commerce Group* arbitration. It will be noted that the second question, in particular, has already been addressed and decided by the Tribunal in Part 2 above; but it remains necessary to duplicate below the same overall analysis.\n\n3.32.\n\n***The First Question:*** With regard to the first question, the Tribunal does not find in the text, object or purpose of CAFTA any indication that, in order to qualify for protection under the treaty, CAFTA requires an investor to have a Party\u2019s nationality prior to making its investment.\n\n3.33.\n\nArticle 10.28 of CAFTA defines \"investor of a Party\" as: a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party[\u2026].\" In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, CAFTA Article 10.28 does not require any precise chronological order in the fulfillment of its requirements to quality an \"investor of a Party.\" The Tribunal notes the use of the past tense in regard to the making of an investment; and it also notes that there is no linguistic impediment in an investor otherwise qualified for protection under CAFTA having made its investment prior to such qualification.\n\n3.34.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, for the purpose of this Ratione Temporis issue, what CAFTA requires is not that the investor should bear the nationality of one of the Parties before its investment was made, but that such nationality should exist prior to the alleged breach of CAFTA by the other Party. Therefore, as regards this issue in the present case, the Tribunal is required to determine when the Parties\u2019 dispute arose in order to establish if the Claimant\u2019s required nationality under CAFTA nationality was present at the relevant time.\n\n3.35.\n\n***(ii) The Second Question:*** As already noted earlier in this decision, the Parties strongly disagree as to what is the relevant dispute and the time when it arose. Whilst the Respondent submits that the relevant measure giving rise to the dispute was the failure to issue the environmental permit within the statutorily mandated adjudication period by December 2004 or the termination by negative silence of the exploitation concession proceedings under Article 38 of the Mining Law in January 2007, the Claimant alleges that the relevant measure was the de facto mining ban resulting from a practice of withholding mining-related permits and concessions which only came to light, to the Claimant\u2019s knowledge, in March 2008.123\n\nThe Claimant's Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 14.\n\n3.36.\n\nFor the reasons given in Part 2 above, the Tribunal has determined that the relevant dispute as regards the Claimant\u2019s claims (as now pleaded and clarified in these proceedings) arose on 13 March 2008, at the earliest.\n\n3.37.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s determination has several consequences for the Ratione Temporis issue. First, as a matter of chronology, there is no doubt that at the time the dispute arose in March 2008, the Claimant was a national of the USA, a CAFTA Party (since 13 December 2007). Second, the relevant measure alleged by the Claimant will necessarily focus on unlawful acts or omissions under CAFTA that allegedly took place not earlier than March 2008.\n\n3.38.\n\nSuch being the Tribunal\u2019s analysis, the debate between the Parties concerning: (i) the measures that took place both before the Claimant changed its nationality on 13 December 2007 or before CAFTA entered into force on 1 March 2006; and (ii) the three-year time limit under CAFTA as invoked by the Respondent become irrelevant for the purpose of deciding the Ratione Temporis issue; and it is not necessary for the Tribunal to address their respective submissions any further here.\n\n3.39.\n\n***(iii) The Third Question:*** The Respondent has much relied upon the passage in the award dated 14 March 2011 in the *Commerce Group* arbitration, where the tribunal considered that: \"even if the de facto mining ban policy and the revocation of the permits could be teased apart, the Tribunal is of the view that the policy does not constitute a \"measure\u2019 within the meaning of CAFTA.\"124 The ban was treated by the tribunal as a policy of the Government, as opposed to a measure taken by it. In contrast, the revocation of the environmental permits was treated as a measure taken pursuant to that policy and, as noted, it was the revocation of those permits which put an end to the claimants' mining and processing activities.\n\n*Commerce v. El Salvador*, *supra* note 105, \u00a7 112.\n\n3.40.\n\nIn the opinion of the Tribunal, this passage must be read in the context of that particular case, where there was at least one specific and identifiable governmental measure that allegedly terminated the rights of the claimants.125 That particular measure was challenged by the claimants, both before the local courts and before the CAFTA arbitration tribunal. The CAFTA claim was dismissed by the CAFTA tribunal on the ground that the claimants should have discontinued the local proceedings and, by not having done so, the claimants had infringed the waiver provision in CAFTA Article 10.18.126 Although the tribunal accepted that non-compliance with this waiver provision did not formally dispose of the de facto ban claim (because that particular of action had been not challenged before the local courts),127 it did do so in substance.\n\nId., \u00a7 62, citing the Claimants\u2019 request (\"On September 13, 2006 MARN revoked the environmental permits of the San Sebastian Gold Mine and the San Cristobal Plant and Mine, thereby effectively terminating Claimants' right to mine and process gold and silver\"). In addition, \"Commerce/Sanseb applied to MARN for an environmental permit for the New San Sebastian Exploration Licence and the Nueva Esparta exploration license, and then to Respondent's Ministry of Economy for extension of the exploration licenses. The requested environmental permits were not granted, and on 28 October 2008, El Salvador's Ministry of Economy denied Commerce/Sanseb's application citing Commerce/Sanseb's failure to secure an environment permit\", (Id \u00a7 65).\n\nId. \u00a7 107.\n\nId. \u00a7 108.\n\n3.41.\n\nAs it appears to the Tribunal from this award, the tribunal decided that it was not confronted with separate and distinct claims pleaded by the claimants in that arbitration. Accordingly, the tribunal viewed: \"the Claimants\u2019 claim regarding the de facto mining ban policy as part and parcel of their claim regarding the revocation of the environmental permits.\"128 Therefore, having considered that the claim concerning the revocation of the environmental permit was pleaded by the claimants before the local Salvadoran courts and could not be re-pleaded under CAFTA, the tribunal could only conclude that the same approach needed to be taken to preclude the pleading under CAFTA of the de facto mining ban claim.\n\nId. \u00a7 111\n\n3.42.\n\nGiven this Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the award in its context, the distinction apparently drawn between the Respondent\u2019s policies and measures in paragraph 112 of the award can be seen as being limited to the particular claims pleaded by the claimants in that particular case, as was indeed acknowledged by the tribunal.129\n\nId. \u00a7\u00a7 112 (\"at least based on the Tribunal's evaluation of this particular case\") and 68 (\"...the Tribunal will not address arguments that have not been raised by the Parties, as this Award is a decision only in the dispute as pleaded between them\").\n\n3.43.\n\nIn this Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the present case differs significantly from the *Commerce Group* arbitration. The relevant measure here at issue is not a specific and identifiable governmental measure that effectively terminated the investor's rights at a particular moment in time (i.e. the termination of a permit or license, denial of an application, etc.), but, rather the alleged continuing practice of the Respondent to withhold permits and concessions in furtherance of the exploitation of metallic mining investments.130 Moreover, no legal action against the Respondent has been filed before the local Salvadoran courts by the Claimant. Whilst it will remain for the Claimant to prove its claims at the merits stage of these proceedings, the way the case has been pleaded and clarified by the Claimant before this Tribunal indicates that the distinction made in the *Commerce Group* award, as invoked by the Respondent, is inapplicable to this Ratione Temporis issue.\n\nIn answering the Tribunal's question at the Hearing if \"(A)s we stand today, going back in time to March 2008, has any foreign company been given an exploitation permit for underground mining, first of all as regards any foreign company and, separately, as regards any local -that is, national- company. And if no such and if none have been granted, either none to a foreign company or none to a local company or both, what is the reason for that?\" (page 559, lines 7/22 and 560, line 1), the Respondent answered \"The truth of the matter is that no foreign or national company received a mining exploitation concession in El Salvador since Commerce Group was issued its last concession in August of 2003. The truth of the matter is that since then there have only been two Exploitation Concession Applications. One was by Pacific Mining Corp. of Canada. One was for another company whose name I do not know. That other one was filed in 2005 and was rejected by the Ministry of the Economy in 2006. Since 2005, with the exception of the Pacific Rim Mining Corp. there simply have been no Mining Exploitation Concession Applications\". Respondent\u2019s answers at Hearing D3,614-615.\n\n3.44.\n\n***Decisions:*** In conclusion, as regards the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA claims, the Tribunal decides to reject the Respondent\u2019s objections to its jurisdiction under this Ratione Temporis issue. As already noted in regard to the Abuse of Process issue, however, this is not the decisive issue in regard to the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections to the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA claims.\n\n***PART 4: ISSUE C - DENIAL OF BENEFITS***\n------------------------------------------\n\n***(01) Introduction***\n-----------------------\n\n4.1.\n\nThis third issue regarding denial of benefits arises under CAFTA Article 10.12.2, which permits (but does not require) a CAFTA Party, subject to CAFTA Articles 18.3 and 20.4, to:\n\n*\"...deny the benefits of [Chapter 10 of CAFTA] to an investor of another Party that is an enterprise of such other Party and to investments of that investor if the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the territory of any Party, other than the denying Party and persons of a non-Party, or of the denying Party, own or control the enterprise.\"*\n\n\"Enterprise\" is a broadly defined term under CAFTA Articles 10.28 and 2.1, meaning \"any entity constituted or organized under applicable law, whether or not for profit, and whether privately-owned or governmentally-owned, including any corporation, trust, partnership, sole proprietorship, joint venture, or other association\" and a branch of such enterprise. (The full texts of these CAFTA provisions are set out in the Annex to Part 1 above).\n\n4.2.\n\nThe Tribunal was informed by the Parties that this case is the first time that an arbitration tribunal has been required to address the issue of denial of benefits under CAFTA Article 10.12.2.\n\n4.3.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal (as invited by the Parties) considered whether it was desirable for the Tribunal to draw on past decisions by tribunals addressing provisions on denial of benefits under other treaties, particularly the Energy Charter Treaty. The Tribunal has chosen not to do so here given their different wording, context and effect. (These decisions include *Plama v. Bulgaria; LLC AMTO v. Ukraine* (under the Energy Charter Treaty) and *Petrobart v. Kyrgyz Republic; Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine* (under the USA-Ukraine BIT); and, as tangentially raised, *EMELEC v. Ecuador* (under the USA-Ecuador BIT) and *CCL Oil v. Kazakhstan* (under the USA-Kazakhstan BIT)).\n\n4.4.\n\nAs expressly worded in CAFTA, it is significant that the \"benefits\" denied under CAFTA Article 10.12.2 include all the benefits conferred upon the investor under Chapter 10 of CAFTA, including both Section A on \"Investment\" and Section B on \"Investor-State Dispute Settlement.\" Section B specifically includes CAFTA Article 10.16(3)(a) providing for ICSID arbitration, as here invoked by the Claimant for its claims under CAFTA to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to decide those CAFTA claims against the Respondent. This jurisdictional issue under CAFTA does not therefore resemble the more limited issue under Article 17(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty, although in this respect it resembles the position under Article 1113(1) of NAFTA. The Tribunal is not aware of any decision as to denial of benefits under NAFTA; and none was brought to its attention by the Parties.\n\n4.5.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal determines that, in the present case, it must interpret the relevant text of CAFTA by itself, in accordance with the relevant principles for treaty interpretation under international law as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n***(02) The Respondent's Case***\n--------------------------------\n\n4.6.\n\nThe Respondent contends that it has properly, fully and timeously denied all relevant benefits to the Claimant under CAFTA Article 10.12.2 on 3 August 2010 (the day after the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of 2 August 2010), whereby the Respondent (as a CAFTA Party) may and did deny the benefits of CAFTA (including the provision on dispute resolution here invoked by the Claimant) to an enterprise of another Party, i.e. the Claimant, if \"the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the territory of any Party, other than the denying Party, and persons of a non-Party, or of the denying Party own or control the enterprise.\"\n\n4.7.\n\nIn summary,131 the Respondent contends that the Claimant has never had \"substantial business activities\" in the USA (as a CAFTA Party) and that it is and has been owned and controlled always by persons of a non-CAFTA Party. Whereas the Respondent submits that the ownership/control part of this test under CAFTA Article 10.12.2 is disjunctive, requiring either ownership or control by \"persons of a nonParty\", the Respondent asserts in this case that the Claimant is both owned and controlled by Pacific Rim, a Canadian company and a legal person of a non-CAFTA Party, which has at all relevant times wholly owned the Claimant. The Respondent contends that these facts, effectively admitted by the Claimant during these arbitration proceedings, suffice to justify the Respondent\u2019s denial of benefits under CAFTA Article 10.12.2, validly made in a timely manner on 3 August 2010.\n\nThis summary is largely prepared from the Respondent\u2019s oral submissions at the Hearing and its PostHearing Submissions.\n\n4.8.\n\n***(i) Substantial Business Activities:*** The Respondent relies on Mr Shrake\u2019s evidence as factual confirmation that the Claimant had no relevant business activities in the USA: it submits that Mr Shrake testified that the Claimant does nothing other than hold shares; that it has no employees; that it leases no office space; that it has no bank account [D2,445xx]; that it has no board of directors; that it pays no taxes in the USA; that it owns no tangible property or makes anything in the USA; and that it performs by itself no exploration activities from the USA [D2,493xxff]. The Respondent submits that Mr Shrake also testified that all contributions towards the alleged investments in El Salvador were made not by the Claimant but by the Claimant\u2019s parent company and another company related to the Claimant\u2019s parent company [D5,511xx]. The Respondent contends, again based on Mr Shrake\u2019s evidence, that the Claimant had and has no physical existence whatsoever other than its name on certain documentation; and, thus, that it cannot possibly have (or have had) substantial business activities in the USA.\n\n4.9.\n\nThe Respondent contends that if the mere holding of shares by a claimant acting only as a nominal holding company was a sufficient activity to defeat a denial of benefits under CAFTA (as argued by the Claimant), then the entire purpose of CAFTA Article 10.12.2 would be effectively eviscerated. According to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s case would ensure that all enterprises passively holding shares would qualify for treaty protections under CAFTA, thereby making CAFTA Article 10.12.2 redundant. The Respondent submits that this absurd result cannot be the correct interpretation of the relevant treaty language in CAFTA under international law.\n\n4.10.\n\nIn regard to the Claimant\u2019s alleged investments made in El Salvador, the Respondent refers to wire transfers coming not from the Claimant but from its Canadian parent company (either Pacific Rim or its predecessor); Mr Shrake\u2019s confirmation to such effect in a press release of 3 July 2008, as also explained by Mr Shrake during his oral testimony [D2,488xx]; and the Claimant's slender reliance upon a fragmentary page from an unconsolidated and apparently unaudited balance sheet purporting to show the Claimant carrying an investment in El Salvador as an \"asset\". As to the latter, the Respondent submits that this entry proves nothing as to whether the Claimant itself actually made that investment in the first place (as opposed to its Canadian parent company); and that all it could show, at most, is that at some unidentified time this asset was ostensibly placed on the Claimant\u2019s books. In any event, the Respondent submits that this \"thinly documented indication\" of apparent ownership of an asset located in El Salvador cannot constitute substantial business activities by the Claimant in the USA for the purposes of CAFTA Article 10.12.2.\n\n4.11.\n\n***(ii) Ownership/Control*****:** The Respondent contends that the Claimant was both owned and controlled by persons of a non-CAFTA Party. As to the twin contrary arguments advanced by the Claimant, the Respondent contends that neither can succeed in defeating this straightforward conclusion under CAFTA, as a matter of treaty interpretation and as a matter of undisputed or indisputable fact.\n\n4.12.\n\nFirst, so the Respondent submits, the Claimant wrongly applies the plain language of CAFTA to argue not the ownership of the Claimant, but the different ownership of the Claimant's Canadian parent company (Pacific Rim); and second, the Claimant wrongly asserts that because the majority of the shares in the Canadian parent are allegedly held by persons with postal addresses in the USA, then it must follow that the Canadian parent company is owned by persons of a CAFTA Party (namely the USA) and thus the Claimant, as the Canadian parent\u2019s subsidiary, is indirectly also owned by persons of that same CAFTA Party (the USA).\n\n4.13.\n\nAs to the issue over CAFTA\u2019s interpretation, the Respondent submits that it is legally irrelevant that the Canadian company might have US-based shareholders because, regardless of who or what these shareholders might be or of their nationality, the Claimant remains wholly owned by a person of a non-CAFTA Party for the purpose of CAFTA Article 10.12.2, namely the Claimant\u2019s Canadian parent.\n\n4.14.\n\nAs to the issue over indirect share ownership, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has not established, as a fact, that the Canadian parent is owned by \"nationals\" of the USA. Chapter 10 of CAFTA defines \"national\" as \"a natural person who has the nationality of a Party according to Annex 2.1 (Country-Specific Definitions)\"; CAFTA Annex 2.1 provides that, for the USA, \"... 'a natural person who has the nationality of a Party' means 'national of the United States' as defined in the existing provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act\"; and that the US statute defines a \"national of the United States\" as either \"(A) a citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.\" (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(22)). CAFTA and the US statute, so submits the Respondent, take no account of postal addresses in the USA.\n\n4.15.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that a postal address or even residence in the USA is not the same as nationality or permanent allegiance under US law because there are many natural and legal persons with addresses in the USA who are not nationals or do not owe permanent allegiance to the USA.\n\n4.16.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that it would violate basic principles of treaty interpretation under international law to ignore such a carefully drafted definition in CAFTA and instead to substitute what the Claimant acknowledges to be domestic \"rules of thumb\" used by different U.S. governmental agencies for different purposes, not involving a definition in a multilateral treaty subject to international law. Moreover, even under these so-called proxies invoked by the Claimant, the Respondent contends that, as an evidential matter, the Claimant has not identified these US-based persons; and it therefore remains impossible for the Respondent (and the Tribunal) even to test the Claimant\u2019s unfounded factual assertions.\n\n4.17.\n\n***(iii) Timeliness:*** The Respondent contends that it denied timeously benefits under CAFTA on 3 August 2010 as regards the Claimant; that its notification to the USA on 1 March 2010 was also made timeously; that its invocation of CAFTA\u2019s denial of benefits provision was not required before the commencement of these ICSID arbitration proceedings by the Claimant on 30 April 2009 (with its Notice of Arbitration); and that in any event such invocation could not have been made before 13 December 2007 when the Claimant became an enterprise of the USA (as a CAFTA Party).\n\n4.18.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the plain language of CAFTA sets forth the requirements for the invocation of denial of benefits; and that, notably, nowhere does CAFTA impose any time-limit for such an invocation by a CAFTA Party by notice to a claimant. The Respondent also cites Ms Kinnear\u2019s NAFTA Guide and Thorn & Doucleff\u2019s \"Disregarding the Corporate Veil and Denial of Benefits Clauses: Testing Treaty Language and the Concept of \"Investor\u2019\" (2010) to show that, in practice, the question whether a State has the right to deny benefits to an investor is most unlikely to arise before a dispute with that investor: \"Before this, states do not necessarily have either a reason or the opportunity to evaluate the nationality of the investors involved in potentially countless foreign investments within their territory.\"\n\n4.19.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that a CAFTA Party\u2019s invocation of denial of benefits remains appropriate after an ICSID arbitration has commenced; and that it does not amount to the unilateral withdrawal of consent prohibited by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. According to the Respondent, the CAFTA Party is not there withdrawing consent because the general consent expressed in CAFTA Article 10.17 to \"the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Section in accordance with this Agreement,\" remains intact; but there was and remains no unconditional consent to arbitrate disputes with an enterprise falling within CAFTA Article 10.12.2. The Respondent submits that an investor of a non-CAFTA Party cannot enjoy the benefits of CAFTA; and that CAFTA\u2019s provision on denial of benefits simply protects CAFTA Parties and their nationals from \"free-riding\" non-CAFTA Party investors improperly invoking arbitration and other benefits under CAFTA.\n\n4.20.\n\nAccordingly, so the Respondent submits, the timing of the Respondent\u2019s invocation of denial of benefits was appropriate as a timely jurisdictional objection in these ICSID arbitration proceedings; and that this timing has permitted the Tribunal to consider the denial of benefits issue efficiently under the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules, along with other objections to jurisdiction made by the Respondent. Conversely, the Respondent submits that an implied time-limit requiring that the denial of benefits under CAFTA Article 10.12.2 must be invoked prior to an arbitration\u2019s commencement would lead to several practical difficulties for CAFTA Parties.\n\n4.21.\n\nThe Respondent accepts, however, that a CAFTA Party may not wait until after an adverse award to invoke denial of benefits under CAFTA for measures addressed in that arbitration award. It submits, apart from considerations of good faith, that in an ICSID arbitration, a \"party which knows or should have known that a provision of... these [ICSID Arbitration] Rules or of any other rules or agreement applicable to the proceeding... has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed... to have waived its right to object\" pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.\n\n4.22.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the present case demonstrates the inappropriateness of requiring a CAFTA Party to invoke denial of benefits prior to the commencement of an arbitration. Here, the Respondent did not have any notice that the Claimant changed its nationality in December 2007 (from the Cayman Islands to the USA) until 16 June 2008; that such notice was not volunteered by the Claimant but given in response to an unrelated query by the Respondent's National Investment Office; and that the Respondent would not even then have had any reason to understand that the Claimant was to become a claimant under CAFTA or whether, in such a dispute, the Respondent could invoke denial of benefits under CAFTA Article 10.12.2.\n\n4.23.\n\nNor, according to the Respondent, is there any requirement under CAFTA for the invocation of denial of benefits in the short ninety-day period between a CAFTA Party\u2019s receipt of the Notice of Intent from a claimant and that claimant\u2019s subsequent filing of a Notice of Arbitration under CAFTA. It would be unreasonable, so the Respondent submits, to require a CAFTA Party to engage professional legal advisers, complete all necessary researches, vet the decision to deny benefits with appropriate government agencies and then promptly invoke its right to deny benefits all within ninety days of receiving each and every Notice of Intent, especially where a Notice of Intent might not even be followed by any Notice of Arbitration at all.\n\n4.24.\n\nMoreover, in the present case, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's Notice of Intent was cursory and even misleading: it asserted (wrongly) that the Claimant was an \"American investor\" which was \"predominantly managed and directed from its exploration headquarters in Reno, Nevada\" (Introduction and paragraph 6).\n\n4.25.\n\nThe Respondent contends that by 1 March 2010 it had only partially completed its investigations into the Claimant's ownership and business activities when it provided to the U.S. Trade Representative a notification letter of the Respondent\u2019s intent to deny benefits to the Claimant under CAFTA Article 10.12.2; that the Respondent necessarily continued its investigations thereafter until its invocation of denial of benefits on 3 August 2010; and that there was therefore no delay, still less any undue delay by the Respondent.\n\n4.26.\n\nThe Respondent contends further that, in any event, the Claimant has not suffered any prejudice from the timing of the Respondent\u2019s denial of benefits under CAFTA Article 10.12.2. Indeed, so the Respondent submits, the Claimant was not itself entitled to any notice from the Respondent under CAFTA, as distinct from notification to the USA as the most directly affected CAFTA Party under CAFTA Article 18.3.\n\n4.27.\n\nThe Respondent particularly dismisses the Claimant's argument that the Claimant has somehow been prejudiced because the timing of the notice of denial of benefits prevented the USA from engaging in the consultation procedure under CAFTA Article 20.4. The Respondent contends that such participation could not be an inappropriate grant of \"diplomatic protection\" in contravention of Article 27(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent emphasises that if there were any merit to the Claimant\u2019s argument, it would be the USA (not the Claimant) which would have standing to make such an objection in this case; but the USA not only does not raise the Claimant\u2019s argument but clearly rejects that argument in its own Submission to this Tribunal.\n\n4.28.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent formally made the following statement at the Hearing, as recorded in the transcript: \"[I]f the United States of America wishes to initiate such consultations with El Salvador with respect to the invocation of the denial of benefits, El Salvador would not have any objection to those consultations on the basis that they would amount to diplomatic protection for purposes of Article 27 of the ICSID Convention, and El Salvador expressly waives any right it might have to object to those consultations on that ground.\"132\n\nHearing D4,649.\n\n4.29.\n\nLastly, the Respondent contends that its case is supported by the USA\u2019s state practice relevant to CAFTA Article 20.4 and ICSID Article 27. The Respondent refers to the US Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 7 - Consular Services, Part 671, Assistance to Citizens Involved in Commercial, Investment and Other Business Related Disputes Abroad (\"FAM\"), as showing that the USA\u2019s official policy on handling foreign investment disputes of U.S. nationals overseas closely tracks the distinction made in ICSID Article 27(1) and Article 27(2) between (i) diplomatic protection and espousal and (ii) informal communications meant to facilitate dispute resolution; that FAM prohibits consular officers from taking a position on the merits of a foreign investment dispute until the requirements for espousal have been met, including the exhaustion of local and other remedies (which expressly include international arbitration under any applicable international treaty); that, until that time, \"the scope of appropriate USG [U.S. Government] assistance is generally confined to consular services aimed at helping the United States citi-zen/national navigate the host country legal system\"; that the USA \"may in its discretion decide to make diplomatic representations to the host government in order to encourage expeditious resolution of the dispute\"; but that there is a clear limit on such representations, as follows: \"In all such cases, however, posts [i.e., embassies and consulates] should be clear both with the host government and with the investor that such representations do not reflect a decision on the part of the USG that the claim is valid, but rather reflect our interest in having the claim amicably and expeditiously resolved\" (paragraph l). The Respondent submits, therefore, that there was and can have been no practical difficulty in this case arising from ICSID Article 27(1).\n\n4.30.\n\nIn conclusion, for all these reasons, the Respondent contends that it has effectively denied the Claimant and its investments any benefits under CAFTA; and that consequently this Tribunal has no jurisdiction or competence to decide any of the Claimant\u2019s claims under CAFTA and the ICSID Convention.\n\n***(03) The Claimant's Case***\n------------------------------\n\n4.31.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent has failed to establish any of the conditions for invoking its denial of benefits to the Claimant under CAFTA Article 10.12.2.\n\n4.32.\n\nIn summary,133 the Claimant contends that it has substantial business activities in the USA; that it is both owned and controlled by persons of the USA as a CAFTA Party; and that the Respondent did not give timely notice of its invocation of CAFTA Article 10.12.2.\n\nThis summary is largely prepared from the Claimant\u2019s oral submissions at the Hearing and its PostHearing Submissions.\n\n4.33.\n\n***(i) Substantial Business Activities:*** The Claimant contends that the Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of proving its positive assertion that the Claimant lacks \"substantial business activities\" in the USA; that, ignoring evidence to the contrary, the Respondent\u2019s argument is narrowly focused on a small check-list of activities which must be present (but only according to the Respondent) in order to qualify as substantial business activities; and that the Respondent\u2019s mechanical approach is inconsistent with the text, object and purpose of CAFTA.\n\n4.34.\n\nTaking all the evidence as a whole, the Claimant submits that it has substantial business activities in the USA, whether the Claimant is considered separately as a single holding company (which, along with its holdings, has been continuously managed since 1997 from Nevada, USA) or whether the Claimant is considered as part of a group of Nevada-based companies (which together contributed substantial financial capital, intellectual property, personnel and oversight to the companies\u2019 Salvadoran operations). Accordingly, so the Claimant submits, its activities fall squarely within the meaning of \"substantial business activities\" in the USA under CAFTA Article 10.12.2.\n\n4.35.\n\n***(ii) Ownership/Control*** : The Claimant contends that the Respondent has equally failed to discharge its burden of rebutting the evidence that the Claimant ultimately is owned and controlled by persons of the USA as a CAFTA Party; and that the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant is owned and controlled directly by its Canadian parent (Pacific Rim) ignores the fact that the ultimate owners and controllers of the Claimant are those US persons who own a majority of the shares in the Canadian parent.\n\n4.36.\n\nAs to control, the Claimant submits, taking all the evidence as a whole, that the Claimant is controlled, in the sense of exercise of critical decision-making, by a US national (Mr Shrake); that Mr Shrake serves as one of the managers of the Claimant (the Claimant\u2019s board of directors having been replaced by three managers consequent upon the change of nationality from the Cayman Islands to the USA in December 2007); and therefore, as both a manager and de facto chief executive officer of the Claimant, Mr Shrake has (and had) the power to direct and control the activities of the Claimant.\n\n4.37.\n\nAs to ownership, the Claimant also submits that the fact of majority ownership by US nationals (shareholders in the Claimant\u2019s parent company) and day-to-day management by a US national in the USA precludes the Respondent from denying CAFTA\u2019s benefits to the Claimant under CAFTA Article 10.12.2.\n\n4.38.\n\n***(iii) Timeliness:*** The Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s attempt to deny CAFTA benefits to the Claimant must also fail because the Respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements of CAFTA Article 10.12.2 requiring the Respondent to provide to the USA timely notice of its intent to deny benefits to the Claimant and an opportunity to engage in State-to-State consultations; that the Respondent deliberately waited until 1 March 2010 (fifteen months after the Claimant provided the Respondent with its Notice of Intent) for the Respondent\u2019s notice to the USA, long after the time for any meaningful State-to-State consultation envisaged by CAFTA Article 10.12.2; and that the denial of benefits could not be validly made by the Respondent on 3 August 2010 long after the commencement of this ICSID arbitration.\n\n4.39.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent could have notified the USA as early as June 2008 (following the meeting between the Respondent\u2019s President, the USA\u2019s Ambassador and Pacific Rim\u2019s chief executive officer); and that the Respondent has never offered any satisfactory explanation in these proceedings as to why it chose deliberately to wait so long before providing the notice in March 2010 to the USA or the later notice in August 2010 to the Claimant.\n\n4.40.\n\nThe Claimant contends that CAFTA requires that a Party provide timely notice of its intention to deny benefits before the filing of a request for arbitration by a claimant; that, in contrast to almost every one of the 44 other U.S. investment treaties and free trade agreements concluded since NAFTA entered into force in 1994, CAFTA makes the invocation of denial of benefits \"subject to\" compliance with two other CAFTA articles: (i) the first on the provision of notice to other CAFTA Parties of measures that may affect CAFTA rights under CAFTA Article 18.3; and (ii) the second on formal State-to-State consultations under CAFTA Article 20.4; that, as denial of an investor\u2019s CAFTA benefits is made \"subject to\" these two obligations, compliance with these obligations must precede an actual denial of benefits by a CAFTA Party; and that compliance with these two obligations must necessarily occur before any claims are submitted by a claimant to ICSID arbitration under CAFTA.\n\n4.41.\n\nThe Claimant denies that its interpretation of CAFTA imposes any undue or impractical burden on CAFTA Parties. In particular, in the present case as already indicated, the Claimant contends that the Respondent could have provided the required notice in June 2008 (see above) or at least in December 2008 (after receiving the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Intent and before the Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration in April 2009); that, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s argument, it was not necessary for the Respondent to engage in lengthy investigations to determine whether all the criteria for denial of benefits were definitively established before the Respondent could provide such notice to the USA; and that CAFTA\u2019s notification and consultation procedures exist so that CAFTA Parties may consult with one another over the merits of a proposed measure, such as a proposed (but not actual) denial of benefits to an investor of another CAFTA Party.\n\n4.42.\n\nThe Claimant dismisses the Respondent\u2019s subsidiary reliance upon the notice requirement in CAFTA Article 18.3 applying only \"[t]o the maximum extent possible.\" The Claimant contends that this plain language means only what it says: i.e., that failure to provide notice will not result in a breach of CAFTA in circumstances where it is actually impossible for the CAFTA Party to provide such notice, as opposed to mere inconvenience, impracticality or arbitration strategy; that the former would include an emergency measure adopted by the CAFTA Party to deal urgently with a natural disaster or a situation in which the CAFTA Party\u2019s legislative branch unexpectedly amended a law without warning the executive branch effectively responsible for providing notice to CAFTA Parties under CAFTA Article 18.3; and that, in contrast, nothing in the circumstances of the Respondent\u2019s dealings with the Claimant in the present case limited the possibility of the Respondent in providing timely notice to the USA of its proposed denial of benefits to the Claimant.\n\n4.43.\n\nThe Claimant also dismisses the Respondent\u2019s subsidiary reliance upon CAFTA Article 18.3 relating to \"proposed or actual measures,\" as if the Respondent could notify the USA of its denial of benefits to the Claimant at the point only when such denial was \"proposed\" or \"actual.\" The Claimant contends that, consistent with the ordinary meaning of CAFTA Article 18.3, a CAFTA Party\u2019s obligation requires notice of any measure that might affect another CAFTA Party\u2019s interests under CAFTA (such as a denial of benefits to one of that Party\u2019s investors), whether that measure is proposed or actual; that State-to-State consultations would be of little utility (if any) if, as appears to have been the case when the Respondent sent its notice to the USA, the denying Party has already made up its mind and was already firmly committed to its position; and that the Respondent\u2019s limited interpretation of its obligation under CAFTA Article 18.3 (with CAFTA Article 10.12.2) violates the legal principle of \" *effet utile* \" under international law.\n\n4.44.\n\nThe Claimant contends further that a denying CAFTA Party\u2019s notice under CAFTA Article 10.12.2 must be provided in a timely manner for State-to-State consultations to occur before claims are submitted to ICSID arbitration by the Claimant because otherwise ICSID Article 27(1) renders later consultations impermissible.\n\n4.45.\n\nThe Claimant stresses the fact that the Respondent deliberately waited five months to deny benefits to the Claimant in August 2010 after its notice to the USA in March 2010; that the Respondent\u2019s tendered explanation lacks any substance (namely: \"... because this really is the first denial of benefits that we\u2019re aware of under CAFTA or NAFTA. And because we take seriously the opportunity of the United States Government or any other affected Party to engage in State-to-State consultation\");134 that if the Respondent had truly wished to provide the USA with an opportunity to engage in State-to-State consultations, the Respondent would not have waited until this ICSID arbitration was well under way, at which point the USA was bound by its treaty obligation under ICSID Article 27(1) not to give any diplomatic protection to the Claimant; and that tactical ad hoc waivers made unilaterally by the Respondent at the Hearing (significantly to the Claimant and not the USA) cannot amend the interpretation of two multilateral treaties under international law.\n\nHearing D3,647.\n\n4.46.\n\nThe Claimant submits that arguments that the investor\u2019s claim is valid are clearly intended to be addressed by the State-to-State consultation procedure under CAFTA Article 20.4; that the very purpose of notice and consultation qualifying CAFTA Article 10.12.2 is to give the CAFTA Parties the opportunity to exchange views on both facts and law relevant to the claim (including any proposed denial of benefits); and that it is not credible that the USA would have agreed to a procedure in CAFTA that would require precisely the kind of intervention into the merits of a dispute in a pending arbitration contrary to ICSID Article 27(1).\n\n4.47.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, for this reason, if the Respondent\u2019s interpretation were adopted, then for tactical reasons a CAFTA Party could deliberately wait until after an investor had submitted its claim to ICSID arbitration to invoke denial of benefits under CAFTA (just as the Respondent did in the present case); and that by such deliberate delay, the CAFTA Party could thwart any objection from the investor\u2019s CAFTA Party under CAFTA Articles 18.3 and 20.4, notwithstanding CAFTA Article 10.12.2.\n\n4.48.\n\nThe Claimant submits that there is no legitimate reason based on the text or context of CAFTA for the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the proper time to provide notice to a claimant can be delayed to the jurisdictional phase of an arbitration. Indeed, so the Claimant contends, under the Respondent\u2019s interpretation there is no reason why a respondent could not wait to deny benefits until after an award has been made in favour of such claimant. The Claimant submits that this absurd result cannot be the correct interpretation of CAFTA Article 10.12.2 under international law.\n\n4.49.\n\nLastly, the Claimant contends that ICSID Article 25(1) prevents the Respondent from denying benefits to the Claimant after claims have been submitted to arbitration by the Claimant because once a Contracting State has consented to ICSID arbitration with a claimant, that consent is irrevocable and may not be unilaterally withdrawn; and that the Respondent\u2019s mistaken interpretation of CAFTA Article 10.12.2 would allow a respondent CAFTA Party to withdraw its consent after claims had been submitted by a claimant to arbitration, in violation of ICSID Article 25(1).\n\n4.50.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant contends that the Respondent has not satisfied any of the conditions for denying benefits to the Claimant under CAFTA Article 10.12.2; and that, accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s attempt to deprive the Claimant of CAFTA benefits should fail and should have no effect on this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to address the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA claims on their merits.\n\n***(04) Non-Disputing Parties' Submissions***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n4.51.\n\n***Costa Rica:*** In its Submission, Costa Rica observes that no provision of CAFTA requires the CAFTA Party to address any communications \"to the individual concerned\" (paragraph 3), as distinct from addressing the other CAFTA Party under CAFTA Articles 18.3 and 20.4. Costa Rica also observes that the consultation procedure between CAFTA Parties under CAFTA Article 20.4 does not amount to diplomatic protection within the meaning of ICSID Article 27(1), citing the International Law Commission\u2019s Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection (paragraph 5).\n\n4.52.\n\nAs to timing, Costa Rica observes that CAFTA Article 10.12.2 is silent on when a CAFTA Party may deny benefits; and it suggests that, consequently, \"denial of benefits may occur at any time, regardless even of the existence or not of an investment arbitration\" (paragraph 6), particularly when a tribunal is examining its jurisdiction (paragraphs 8 & 9), although such a denial could not be legally effective after an award was made (paragraph 7).\n\n4.53.\n\nCosta Rica analyses the object and purpose of CAFTA Article 10.12.2, as follows (paragraphs 12 & 13):\n\n\" *12... the denial of benefits clause of [CAFTA Article 10.12] aims to correct a situation where investors, who may formally be from a Party to the Treaty but are not such in reality, attempt to benefit from the Treaty. In this regard it is a clause that privileges substance over form... An interpretation of [CAFTA Article 10.12] that creates formal requirements, including as to the moment of invocation, that are not present in the text of the treaty and that have the effect of denying the provision of any practicality goes against the object and purpose of the Treaty.*\n\n*13 A State Party to DR-CAFTA is not necessarily informed at all times of the share make-up and corporate structure of all investors from other Parties to the Treaty in its territory. What is more likely is that the State only becomes aware of who owns or controls a company at the time when there is a dispute, which escalates into an investment arbitration. Failing to allow the invocation of the denial of benefits* *clause even when an investment arbitration has already commenced deprives this* *provision of any effectiveness.\"*\n\n4.54.\n\nAs regards the nationality of a natural person under CAFTA Article 10.12.2, Costa Rica observes that, with respect to the USA, CAFTA expressly provides that such nationality is determined by the US Immigration and Nationality Act, to the exclusion of other domestic law instruments (paragraph 16).\n\n4.55.\n\n***USA:*** In its Submission, the USA observes that CAFTA Article 10.12.2 \"is consistent with a long-standing U.S. policy to include a denial of benefits provision in investments to safeguard against the potential problem of \"free-rider\" investors, i.e. third party entities that may only as a matter of formality be entitled to the benefits of a particular agreement\", citing NAFTA Article 1113 and also testimony before the US House of Representatives by one of CAFTA\u2019s US negotiators (paragraph 3).\n\n4.56.\n\nThe USA observes (in common with Costa Rica) that a CAFTA Party is not required to invoke denial of benefits under CAFTA Article 10.12.2 before an arbitration commences; and that it may do so as part of a jurisdictional defence after a claim has been submitted to arbitration (paragraph 5). The USA likewise observes that this CAFTA provision contains no time-limit for its invocation; and that a contrary interpretation would place an untenable burden on a CAFTA Party, contrary to the purpose of CAFTA Article 10.12.2:\n\n*\"... It would require the respondent, in effect, to monitor the ever-changing business activities of all enterprises in the territories of each of the other six CAFTA-DR Parties that attempt to make, are making, or have made investments in the territory of the respondent [citing Ms Kinnear\u2018s NAFTA Commentary]. This would include conducting, on a continuing basis, factual research, for all such enterprises, on their respective corporate structures and the extent of their business activities in those countries. To be effective, such monitoring would in many cases require foreign investors to provide business confidential and other types of non-public information for review. Requiring CAFTA-DR Parties to conduct this kind of continuous oversight in order to be able to invoke the denial of benefits provision under Article 10.12.2 before a claim is submitted to arbitration would undermine the purpose of the provision\" (paragraph 6).*\n\n4.57.\n\nThe USA also observes that neither CAFTA Article 10.12.2 nor CAFTA Article 18.3 require a CAFTA Party to give any notice to a claimant (such as the Claimant in the present case); and the USA notes that CAFTA Article 20.4.1 is only discretionary even as to CAFTA Parties: \"Any Party *may* request in writing consultations with any other Party...\" (emphasis supplied).\n\n***(05) Amicus Curiae***\n------------------------\n\n4.58.\n\nThe Amicus Curiae observes in its Submission that CAFTA Article 10.12.2 \"provides an important safeguard to CAFTA Parties and their citizens\" and \"cannot be emptied of practical effect\" or rendered \"a nullity\" (page 13).\n\n4.59.\n\nThe Amicus Curiae also observes that an imposed time-limit for the invocation of denial of benefits by a CAFTA Party \"would necessarily be expensive\" for that Party [i.e. as the host State] which may \"be facing serious imperatives regarding poverty alleviation and the attainment of the millennium development goals\". It also observes that even if, theoretically, a CAFTA Party \"could establish and maintain the required system of pre-investment investigation and post-investment monitoring of a foreign investor's ownership structure,\" such a system would also be \"intrusive for the investor, creating more bureaucratic hurdles and as such likely reducing foreign investment, not increasing it.\" (page 13).\n\n***(06) The Tribunal's Analysis and Decisions***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n4.60.\n\n***Introductory Matters:*** The Tribunal approaches this issue as to denial of benefits on the basis that it is primarily for the Respondent to establish, both as to law and fact, its positive assertion that the Respondent has effectively denied all relevant benefits under CAFTA to the Claimant pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.12.2 and that, conversely, it is not primarily for the Claimant here to establish the opposite as a negative.\n\n4.61.\n\nThe Tribunal determines that the meaning and application of CAFTA Article 10.12.2, interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose under international law, require the Respondent to establish two conditions in the present case: (i) that the Claimant has no substantial business activities in the territory of the USA (beyond mere form) and (ii) either (a) that the Claimant is owned by persons of a non-CAFTA Party (here Canada) or (b) that the Claimant is controlled by persons of a non-CAFTA Party (here also Canada, or at least persons not of the USA or the Respondent as CAFTA Parties). In addition, the Tribunal considers below whether a third condition is required as to the time by which the Respondent should have elected to deny benefits under CAFTA Article 10.12.2 and, if so, whether that deadline was met by the Respondent in the present case.\n\n4.62.\n\nIt is convenient for the Tribunal to address in turn each of these three questions.\n\n4.63.\n\n( ***i) Substantial Business Activities:*** It is clear to the Tribunal from the factual evidence adduced in these arbitration proceedings that the group of companies of which the Claimant forms part has and has had since December 2007 substantial business activities in the USA.\n\n4.64.\n\nA useful description of such activities was given by Ms McLeod-Selzer, the Chairman of Pacific Rim, a Director of Pacific Rim Exploration Inc, the President and a Director of Dayton Mining (U.S.) Inc. and also one of the Claimant\u2019s managers. Significantly, the Respondent chose not to cross-examine this witness at the Jurisdiction Hearing. In the circumstances, for present purposes, the Tribunal accepts her written testimony as regards such activities.\n\n4.65.\n\nMs McLeod-Selzer\u2019s description in her written witness statement leaves no doubt as to the existence of such activities in Nevada, USA by \"the Companies\", defined by this witness to mean collectively Pacific Rim and all its subsidiaries, including the Claimant:\n\n*\"... the Companies have always had a substantial presence in Nevada, USA. Indeed, Mr. Thomas C. Shrake, who has served as the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of Pacific Rim Mining Corporation since 1997, has always maintained his offices* *there, along with the Companies\u2018 other senior geologists. Mr. Shrake has largely* *managed the Companies, including [the Claimant] and its Salvadoran subsidiaries [PRES and DOREX] from Nevada. Pacific Rim Mining has other subsidiaries in Nevada, including Dayton Mining (U.S.) Inc, which provided a substantial portion of the capital invested in El Salvador. [The Claimant] is a legitimate holding company, which for many years has held the Companies\u2018 most important assets, namely our Salvadoran subsidiaries...\"*135\n\nMs McLeod-Selzer\u2019s witness statement, \u00a7 *5.*\n\n4.66.\n\nHowever, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, this first condition under CAFTA Article 10.12.2 relates not to the collective activities of a group of companies, but to activities attributable to the \"enterprise\" itself, here the Claimant. If that enterprise\u2019s own activities do not reach the level stipulated by CAFTA Article 10.12.2, it cannot aggregate to itself the separate activities of other natural or legal persons to increase the level of its own activities: those would not be the enterprise\u2019s activities for the purpose of applying CAFTA Article 10.12.2.\n\n4.67.\n\nAccordingly, the relevant question is whether the Claimant by itself had substantial activities in the USA from 13 December 2007 onwards. The Tribunal accepts that there were and are certain activities by the Claimant in the USA; and there can be no criticism of their legitimacy under the laws of the USA; but the question remains whether such activities were \"substantial\" within the meaning of CAFTA Article 10.12.2. Here Ms McLeod-Selzer\u2019s written testimony provides little assistance to the Tribunal.\n\n4.68.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the evidence adduced in these proceedings shows only that the Claimant was a passive actor both in the USA and the Cayman Islands both before and after December 2007, with no material change consequent upon its change of nationality. In addition to the written testimony of Ms McLeod-Selzer, Mr Shrake\u2019s oral testimony demonstrates the slender scale of the Claimant\u2019s activities.\n\n4.69.\n\nMr Shrake testified orally as follows at the Hearing:\n\n\" *Q. Now, how many employees did Pac Rim Cayman [the Claimant] have while it was registered in the Cayman Islands? A. It's a holding company. It doesn't have employees.*\n\n*Q. Okay. Did it lease any office space? A. For no employees? No, it didn't lease office space.*\n\n*Q. Did it own anything other than the Shares in the company [sic] it held on behalf of Pacific Rim Mining? A. The verb [is] being held, it's a holding company. Its purpose is to hold.*\n\n*Q. But it did nothing else. It held those shares. It didn't own any? A. That's what a holding company does.*\n\n*Q. Okay. Did it have annual board meetings? A. Yes, I believe.*\n\n*Q. Were minutes kept of those board meetings? A. I don't know, actually, for sure.*\n\n*Q. Okay. Did it have a bank account? A. Oh, no, it did not have a bank-*\n\n*Q. So, pretty much it just existed on paper? A. No - well, no. It's a holding company. The purpose of the company is to hold assets.*\n\n*Q. Right. But what physical existence, what existence did it have other than on the documents that exist perhaps in your office and registered with the corporate Registry in the Cayman Islands? A. None,.136*\n\nHearing D2,445-446xx.\n\n4.70.\n\nLater during his oral evidence, Mr Shrake testified:\n\n*A:... [The Claimant] is a holding company. It apparently has no Board of Directors [Here the witness was seeking to correct his earlier evidence that the Claimant did have a board of directors: see D2,430 & 491-492]... It has two \u2014 apparently only has two managers [sic]. But again, this is a company designed solely to hold assets. There is [sic] no exploration activities directly through that* *holding company. This is, as the name suggests, strictly a company to hold assets.*137\n\nHearing D2,492-493xx.\n\n4.71.\n\nMr. Shrake also explained that the principal activities of the group of companies in Nevada, USA were not the Claimant\u2019s but those of Pacific Rim Exploration Inc. as regards \"mine-finding\u2019 and \"wealth creation\u2019, with which company he identified himself (i.e. not the Claimant): \"We are the intellectual property of the company\" and \"it contributed everything to El Salvador.\"138 This explanation significantly excluded the Claimant from the scope of such activities (not being involved with such intellectual property, in contrast to Pacific Rim Exploration Inc).\n\nHearing D2,511-512xx.\n\n4.72.\n\nThis Tribunal does not here decide that a traditional holding company could never meet the first condition in CAFTA Article 10.12.2 as to \"substantial business activities\". Generally, such holding companies are passive, owing all or substantially all of the shares in one or more subsidiary companies which will employ personnel and produce goods or services to third parties. The commercial purpose of a holding company is to own shares in its group of companies, with attendant benefits as to control, taxation and risk-management for the holding company\u2019s group of companies. It will usually have a board of directors, board minutes, a continuous physical presence and a bank account.\n\n4.73.\n\nThat is clearly not the case here with the Claimant, compounded by its change of nationality. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimant\u2019s case fails the simple factual test of distinguishing between its geographical activities before and after the change of nationality in December 2007. It is not possible from the evidence of Ms McLeod-Selzer and Mr Shrake (including contemporary documentary exhibits) for the Tribunal to identify any material difference between the Claimant\u2019s activities as a company established in the Cayman Islands and its later activities as a company established in the USA: the location (or non-location) of the Claimant\u2019s activities remained essentially the same notwithstanding the change in nationality; and such activities were equally insubstantial.\n\n4.74.\n\nIt will be recalled that the first condition in CAFTA Article 10.20.2 addresses \"substantial business activities in the territory\" of the USA. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimant cannot here attribute geographical activities to the Claimant \"in the territory\" of the USA when those same activities (including their location) are not materially different from its earlier insubstantial activities as a company in the Cayman Islands. Moreover, the Claimant\u2019s activities, both in the Cayman Islands and the USA, were principally to hold the shares of its subsidiaries in El Salvador. The position might arguably be different if it was acting as a traditional holding company owning shares in subsidiaries doing business in the USA; but that is not this case. The Claimant\u2019s activities as a holding company were not directed at its subsidiaries\u2019 business activities in the USA, but in El Salvador.\n\n4.75.\n\nIn short, as regards business activities in the territory of the USA, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant was and is not a traditional holding company actively holding shares in subsidiaries but more akin to a shell company with no geographical location for its nominal, passive, limited and insubstantial activities.\n\n4.76.\n\nIt is not necessary for the purpose of this first condition for the Tribunal to deal in detail with the source of the capital expended in El Salvador as regards the investments held by the Claimant and its subsidiaries or Enterprises. It is clear to the Tribunal from the evidence adduced in these arbitration proceedings that these activities did not originate as part of the Claimant\u2019s own activities in the USA but were associated with Pacific Rim (its Canadian parent), as Mr Shrake testified.139 Accordingly, such capital expenditure does not assist the Claimant\u2019s case under CAFTA.\n\nHearing D2,488-489xx.\n\n4.77.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, here as elsewhere, Mr Shrake was a candid and honest witness; his oral testimony is consistent with other evidence (including the written testimony of Ms McLeod-Selzer); and the Tribunal unhesitatingly accepts his evidence on all these points.\n\n4.78.\n\nIt follows that the first condition is met by the Respondent under CAFTA Article 10.12.2: the Tribunal finds as a fact that the Claimant did not and does not have substantial activities in the USA after December 2007.\n\n4.79.\n\n***(ii) Ownership/Control:*** As to ownership, it is not disputed between the Parties that the Claimant has been and remains wholly owned by its Canadian parent company, Pacific Rim, a person of a non-CAFTA Party for the purpose of CAFTA Article 10.12.2\n\n4.80.\n\nHowever, a majority of the shareholders in this Canadian company, both natural and legal persons, reside or at least have postal addresses in the USA. According to the Claimant, as noted above, this factor is said to result in the Claimant being owned, albeit indirectly, by persons of a CAFTA Party (namely the USA).\n\n4.81.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Respondent is correct in applying CAFTA\u2019s Annex 2.1 referring for natural persons as USA nationals to the US Immigration and Nationality Act. That statute\u2019s requirements for US citizenship or permanent allegiance to the USA cannot be met by adducing mere US postal addresses for shareholders in the Canadian parent company, even assuming them to be natural persons and however convenient or even appropriate for other domestic purposes (as Mr Pasfield testified). The Tribunal does not here decide, were CAFTA\u2019s definition materially different, the question whether or not indirect ownership of the Claimant could suffice to establish the nationality of the Claimant\u2019s ownership.\n\n4.82.\n\nIt follows that that the second condition is met by the Respondent under CAFTA Article 10.12.2: the Tribunal finds as a fact that the Claimant is owned by Pacific Rim Corporation, a legal person of a non-CAFTA Party. In these circumstances, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to decide the alternative part of this second question as to \"control\" under CAFTA Article 10.12.2. It should not be assumed that the Respondent\u2019s case would have failed on this issue, if necessary to the Tribunal\u2019s decisions above.\n\n4.83.\n\n***(iii) Timeliness:*** There is no express time-limit in CAFTA for the election by a CAFTA Party to deny benefits under CAFTA Article 10.12.2. In a different case under different arbitration rules, this third question might have caused this Tribunal certain difficulties given the importance of investor-state arbitration generally and, in particular, the potential unfairness of a State deciding, as a judge in its own interest, to thwart such an arbitration after its commencement. In this case, however, no such difficulties arise for three reasons.\n\n4.84.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal accepts that, given that this was the first denial of benefits by any CAFTA Party under CAFTA Article 10.12.2, denying benefits to the Claimant under CAFTA was a decision requiring particular attention by the Respondent, to be exercised upon sufficient and ascertainable grounds. Inevitably, such a decision requires careful consideration and, inevitably, also time. It is not apparent to the Tribunal that the Respondent thereby deliberately sought or indeed gained any advantage over the Claimant, by waiting until 1 March 2010 (as regards notification to the USA) or 3 August 2010 (for its invocation of denial of benefits to the Claimant).\n\n4.85.\n\nSecond, this is an arbitration subject to the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, as chosen by the Claimant under CAFTA Article 10.16(3)(a). Under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41, any objection by a respondent that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the tribunal \"shall be made as early as possible\" and \"no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial\". In the Tribunal\u2019s view, that is the time-limit in this case here incorporated by reference into CAFTA Article 10.12.2. Any earlier time-limit could not be justified on the wording of CAFTA Article 10.12.2; and further, it would create considerable practical difficulties for CAFTA Parties inconsistent with this provision\u2019s object and purpose, as observed by Costa Rica and the USA from their different perspectives as host and home States (as also by the Amicus Curiae more generally). In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Respondent has respected the time-limit imposed by ICSID Arbitration Rule 41.\n\n4.86.\n\nThird, the Tribunal does not accept the Claimant\u2019s arguments based on ICSID Articles 25(1) and 27(1).\n\n4.87.\n\nAs regards ICSID Article 27(1) precluding diplomatic protection in respect of a dispute subject to ICSID arbitration before an award is rendered in such dispute, the Tribunal does not consider that the procedures envisaged by CAFTA Article 20.4 and still less CAFTA Article 18.3 amount to the exercise of diplomatic protection by a CAFTA Party.\n\n4.88.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the reasoning in Costa Rica\u2019s Submission, based on Article 1 of the ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection (2006) describing diplomatic protection as \"the invocation by a State, through diplomatic action or other means of peaceful settlement, of the responsibility of another State for an injury caused by an internationally wrongful act of that State to a natural or legal person that is a national of the former State with a view to the implementation of such responsibility\". Article 16 of the ILC Draft Articles distinguishes between such diplomatic protection and other actions and procedures; namely: \"The rights of States.... to resort under international law to actions or procedures other than diplomatic protection to secure redress for injury suffered as a result of an internationally wrongful act.\" The Tribunal also notes a similar distinction between diplomatic protection under ICSID Article 27(1) and \"informal diplomatic exchanges for the sole purpose of facilitating a settlement of a dispute\" under ICSID Article 27(2).\n\n4.89.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the two CAFTA procedures envisaged by CAFTA Articles 18.3 and 20.4 fall short of diplomatic protection under international law (whatever may be the consular practice of a CAFTA Party, including the USA). Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s submission based on ICSID Article 27(1).\n\n4.90.\n\nAs regards ICSID Article 25(1), the Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s submission to the effect that the Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID Arbitration in CAFTA Article 10.16.3(a) is necessarily qualified from the outset by CAFTA Article 10.12.2. It is not possible for the Tribunal to arrive at any different interpretation without distorting the meaning of Article 10.12.2, contrary to the applicable rules for treaty interpretation under international law. Accordingly, a CAFTA Party\u2019s denial of benefits invoked after the commencement of an ICSID arbitration cannot be treated as the unilateral withdrawal of that Party\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration under ICSID Article 25(1).\n\n4.91.\n\nIt follows that this third condition is met by the Respondent under CAFTA Article 10.12.2.\n\n4.92.\n\n***Decisions:*** Accordingly, for these several reasons above, the Tribunal decides that as from 3 August 2010 the Respondent has established under CAFTA to the required standard and burden of proof, as a matter of fact and international law, that the Claimant as an investor and its investments in El Salvador can receive no benefits from Part 10 of CAFTA upon which the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA claims necessarily depend; and accordingly that the Centre (ICSID) and this Tribunal can have no jurisdiction or other competence in respect of any such CAFTA claims. This decision regarding the Denial of Benefits issue, however, does not affect the Claimant\u2019s other Non-CAFTA claims, as next explained by the Tribunal below, in Part 5 of this Decision.\n\n***PART 5: ISSUE D - INVESTMENT LAW***\n--------------------------------------\n\n***(01) Introduction***\n-----------------------\n\n5.1.\n\nThe Tribunal here addresses the Respondent\u2019s independent and alternative jurisdictional objection to the effect that this Tribunal lacks any jurisdiction under the Investment Law of El Salvador to decide the Claimant\u2019s pleaded Non-CAFTA claims. The Claimant contests this jurisdictional objection in full.\n\n5.2.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the Parties\u2019 debate under this separate issue can be determined largely as a matter of legal interpretation, where issues as to the standard of proof play no material part. It is, however, ultimately for the Claimant to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over its Non-CAFTA claims as a matter of such interpretation.\n\n***(02) The Respondent's Case***\n--------------------------------\n\n5.3.\n\nIn summary,140 the Respondent denies jurisdiction under this issue on four principal grounds: (i) that Article 15 of the Investment Law does not constitute consent to ICSID jurisdiction;141 (ii) even if the Investment Law did constitute such consent and did apply to the Claimant, the Claimant\u2019s claims are precluded for the Claimant\u2019s failure to initiate conciliation before ICSID arbitration;142 (iii) the Claimant is not a foreign investor under the Investment Law;143 and (iv) the CAFTA waiver precludes jurisdiction under the Investment Law.144\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 9; Hearing Day1,119-129.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 337-378; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 225-250.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 424-427; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 253-254.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 379-380; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 255-261.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 428-454; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 262-264.\n\n5.4.\n\nAs to the first ground, the Respondent alleges that Article 15 of the Investment Law does not constitute consent to arbitration for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.145 In the Respondent\u2019s submission, Article 15 contains no consent by the Respondent to arbitration.146\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 337; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00a7 225.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 373.\n\n5.5.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant\u2019s submission that the passage in the *Inceysa* award supports the Claimant\u2019s case that Article 15 constitutes consent under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention: the Respondent contends that this issue was not before the *Inceysa* tribunal and that the short passage cited by the Claimant was mere obiter dicta and should not replace this Tribunal\u2019s own legal analysis of Article 15.147 Further, the Respondent submits that the focus in the *Inceysa* case was on the illegality of the investment by a foreign company;148 therefore, the *Inceysa* case is not relevant to the issue of whether or not Article 15 of the Investment Law constitutes consent; and it is not necessary for the Tribunal to consider that case in order to arrive at its own decision in the present case.149\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 339; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00a7 238.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 339; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00a7 240; Hearing Day 1,127-129.\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00a7 241.\n\n5.6.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s further submission, the Tribunal\u2019s duty to interpret Article 15 cannot be substituted, as the Claimant suggests, by the unreasoned reference to Article 15 in the *Inceysa* award, or academic commentaries, or what the Claimant erroneously refers to as the \"official position\" of the Respondent with respect to Article 15 of its Investment Law.150\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 227-246.\n\n5.7.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Article 15 is a unilateral declaration by the Respondent, as opposed to reciprocal or multilateral statements of consent in a BIT or CAFTA; there is no clear statement of consent in its text; and it must be interpreted restrictively.151 Therefore, so the Respondent contends, by stating that Article 15 should not be interpreted restrictively or by seeking support for its argument in the decisions in *SSP v. Egypt* and *Mobil v. Venezuela,* the Claimant's arguments are fundamentally mistaken.152\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 340-373; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 225-250; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions \u00a7 129.\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00a7 231; Hearing D1,127.\n\n5.8.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s submission, the tribunal in *SPP v. Egypt* did not actually apply the principles of interpretation for a unilateral declaration; and its decision, therefore, does not stand for the proposition that unilateral declarations are not to be interpreted restrictively.153 With regard to the decision in *Mobil v. Venezuela*, the Respondent contends that the tribunal there did not specifically reject a restrictive interpretation for unilateral acts of the State, such as national legislation; and that it concluded that the ambiguous arbitration provision in the applicable investment law, together with the lack of evidence of any intention to consent to arbitration, meant that the investment law did not include a statement of unilateral consent to ICSID arbitration.154\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00a7 232.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 361.\n\n5.9.\n\nAs additional evidence that the Respondent did not intend unilaterally to consent to ICSID arbitration by its Investment Law, the Respondent cites Article 146 of the Salvadoran Constitution which only allows the Respondent to agree to arbitration in treaties and contracts; Article 146 simply does not mention legislation (such as the Investment Law); and the Respondent accordingly cites in support of its case the general principle of legal interpretation: \" *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* \".155\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 374-378; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 251-252; Hearing D1,127.\n\n5.10.\n\nAs to the second ground, the Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s claims are precluded for the Claimant\u2019s failure to initiate conciliation before ICSID arbitration. According to the Respondent, the text of the Investment Law is clear: if a dispute is to be referred to ICSID under Article 15, such dispute is to be settled \"by means of conciliation and arbitration.\" The express linguistic use of the conjunction \"and\" connects conciliation with arbitration, so that both methods of dispute resolution must be used by a claimant. As the Claimant did not initiate any conciliation prior to arbitration for its claims under the Investment Law, the Claimant\u2019s request for ICSID arbitration was and remains impermissible.156\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 424-427; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 253-254.\n\n5.11.\n\nAs to the third ground, the Respondent contends that there is no indication of any investment made by the Claimant in El Salvador at any time. In the Respondent\u2019s submission, the Claimant qualifies as a foreign legal person; but it does not meet the further express requirement of having made an investment in El Salvador. Therefore, the Claimant does not therefore meet the definition of a foreign investor under the Investment Law.157\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 379-380; Jurisdiction Reply \u00a7\u00a7 255-257; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 126.\n\n5.12.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that, even if there were consent to arbitrate in the Investment Law and the Claimant were a foreign investor within the meaning of that law, the Tribunal should still decline jurisdiction in this case because the Claimant is not an investor of a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.158 In the Respondent\u2019s submission, it is appropriate to pierce the corporate veil to identify the real investor - the Canadian parent company, Pacific Rim - which is not an investor of a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention and, therefore, not entitled to claim jurisdiction under the Investment Law before this Tribunal under the ICSID Convention.159\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 381-423.\n\nJurisdiction Reply, \u00a7 261; Hearing D1,129; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7\u00a7 116 and 127.\n\n5.13.\n\nAs to the fourth ground, the Respondent contends that the waiver provision in CAFTA precludes the Claimant from bringing claims under the Investment Law.160 The Respondent reiterates its request, as in its Preliminary Objections, that the Tribunal enforce the Claimant\u2019s waiver to prevent the Claimant from bringing duplicative claims in these ICSID proceedings.161\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 428-454; Jurisdiction Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 262-264.\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 428; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7\u00a7 118-125.\n\n5.14.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent submits that since the Tribunal did not grant its Preliminary Objection in its Decision of 2 August 2010, such impermissible duplication of proceedings survives under this jurisdictional objection and should be addressed here as a jurisdictional objection by the Respondent. The Respondent contends that such duplication of proceedings violated and still violates the Claimant\u2019s written waiver under CAFTA.162\n\nJurisdiction Memorial, \u00a7 429; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 124.\n\n5.15.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that, as the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of 2 August 2010 is not res judicata, the Tribunal may revisit its determination in that Decision on the indivisibility of the two arbitration proceedings initiated by the Claimant under CAFTA and the Investment Law. In the Respondent\u2019s submission, the most important reason to revisit that determination and CAFTA\u2019s waiver provision is that this arbitration\u2019s jurisdictional phase has clearly demonstrated that there are two proceedings based on the same measures; and that the Claimant is intending to detach those two proceedings and go forward with one of these proceedings independently from the other and under a different legal standard. In the Respondent's submission, such result is prohibited by the CAFTA waiver.163\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7\u00a7 120 and 122.\n\n***(03) The Claimant's Case***\n------------------------------\n\n5.16.\n\nThe Claimant contends, under this issue, that the Respondent\u2019s objection should be rejected on the ground that the text of Article 15 of the Investment Law contains the Respondent\u2019s clear and specific consent to ICSID jurisdiction.164\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 426-466; Jurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 281-306; Hearing D1,148; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearings Submissions, \u00a7 91.\n\n5.17.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the decisions made in the *Cemex, Mobil* and *Inceysa* arbitrations, as well as by acknowledged legal scholars cited by the Claimant, all agree that the language of Article 15 is an instrument of consent and, as such, not subject to any principle of restrictive interpretation.165 Indeed, according to the Claimant, all these materials conclude that such language is so clear that under any interpretive standards or principles, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that it contains the Respondent\u2019s unilateral consent to ICSID jurisdiction.166\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 440-450; Jurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7 289; Hearing D1,147-148; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 98.\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 290-299; Hearing D1,147-148; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearings Submissions, \u00a7 92.\n\n5.18.\n\nFurther, the Claimant submits that the legislative history of the Investment Law confirms such an interpretation; and it refers, as an example, to a Power Point presentation made before the *Asamblea Legislativa* at the time of debating the Investment Law bill which expressly referred to \"international arbitration administered by ICSID\" in the case of foreign investment. In the Claimant\u2019s submission, it is clear that at the time when the Respondent promulgated the Investment Law, the *Asamblea* *Legislativa* was fully aware that the wording of Article 15 provided consent by the Respondent to ICSID jurisdiction.167\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 458; Jurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7 301; Hearing D1,148; the Claimant\u2019s PostHearing Submissions, footnote 172.\n\n5.19.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent has not only declined to address the contents of this legislative presentation, but also has failed to provide any evidence contradicting the Claimant\u2019s case. Indeed, according to the Claimant, the Respondent did not provide any evidence (i.e. witness statement, legislative history, academic commentary, etc.) confirming its case that it was never the intention of the Salvadoran legislature to provide for the Respondent\u2019s unilateral consent to ICSID arbitration in the Investment Law.168\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 284 and 303; Hearing D1147; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 96.\n\n5.20.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent\u2019s invocation of Article 146 of the Salvadoran Constitution, the Claimant states that: (i) the Respondent provides no legal authority to support its contention that the Salvadoran Supreme Court has ever applied the maxim \" *expressio unius est exclusio alteriu* s\" to interpret the Respondent\u2019s Constitution; and since the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction to interpret the Salvadoran Constitution in El Salvador, this Tribunal should not allow itself to be pressed into doing what the Respondent\u2019s Supreme Court would not itself do; and (ii) even if the Tribunal were to decide that it could properly apply the maxim *\"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\",* it should appreciate its limited value as a tool for legal interpretation in the present case.169\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 463-466; Jurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 307-312; Hearing D1,147; the Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 95.\n\n5.21.\n\nWith regard to the Respondent\u2019s attempt to attribute significance to the fact that Article 15 does not contain the exact same language as used in some of the Respondent\u2019s BITs or in CAFTA,170 the Claimant submits that the facts, that the word \"consent\" or references to \"mandatory\" arbitration were included in some BITs, is not sufficient to conclude that the absence of such mandatory language or the use of the word \"consent\" in the Investment Law established that the Respondent did not intend to consent to ICSID jurisdiction in that legislative instrument.171\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7 94.\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 462; Jurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 313-316.\n\n5.22.\n\nThe Claimant denies that it was required to initiate conciliation before ICSID arbitration. In its view, the conjunction \"and\" in Article 15 of the Investment Law means only that both dispute settlement mechanisms provided by the ICSID Convention are available to the disputing parties. In the present case, the investor decided to initiate arbitration and not conciliation under the ICSID Convention. Further, the Claimant submits that in the event that the Tribunal considers that conciliation is a procedural requirement under Article 15 of the Investment Law, the Claimant should be released from complying with this requirement because, in the circumstances of this particular case, conciliation was and would remain completely futile.172\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 317-325.\n\n5.23.\n\nWith regard to the CAFTA waiver question raised by the Respondent, the Claimant contends that the matter was definitively settled by the Tribunal when deciding on the Preliminary Objection in its Decision of 2 August 2010; and it should therefore not be revisited at this late stage by the Tribunal.173\n\nJurisdiction Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 472-474; Jurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 326-328.\n\n5.24.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant submits that, it is the proceedings that are indivisible here, not the Claimant\u2019s claims. There is nothing in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of 2 August 2010 that should be revisited in evaluating whether to dismiss any of Claimant\u2019s claims under the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections. The Claimant submits that the dismissal of its CAFTA claims on any of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections cannot be applied to the Claimant\u2019s Non-CAFTA claims under the Investment Law simply because (as the Respondent argues) those latter claims are being ad- dressed as part of the same ICSID arbitration proceedings.174\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7\u00a7 105-112.\n\n5.25.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent\u2019s allegations that the Investment Law is not applicable to the Claimant due to the lack of investments made by the Claimant in El Salvador, the Claimant submits that although substantial portions of the financial and intellectual capital invested in El Salvador are of U.S. origin,175 the nationality of a particular foreign investor is irrelevant for purposes of qualifying as a \"foreign investor\" under the Investment Law. The Claimant\u2019s investments in El Salvador were made before and after the Claimant changed its nationality on 13 December 2007; and its change to US nationality cannot affect its access to ICSID arbitration under the Investment Law. Before its change of nationality, the Claimant was a Cayman Islands company; and as such it could have invoked Article 15 because the United Kingdom\u2019s ratification of the ICSID Convention extended to the Cayman Islands.176 Such being the case, the change in nationality of the Claimant cannot justify the Respondent\u2019s case under this issue.\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 330.\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder \u00a7\u00a7 332-333; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7\u00a7 100-101.\n\n5.26.\n\nLastly, the Claimant contends that it is an enterprise organised under the laws of Nevada, USA. Consequently, under the applicable rules of international law, the Claimant is a national of the USA, which is a Party to the ICSID Convention.177 Moreover, according to the Claimant, if the Claimant\u2019s corporate veil were lifted (contrary to the Claimant\u2019s primary submission), and nationality were then to be assessed by reference to control over the Claimant, the Claimant would have U.S. nationality because the Claimant is (indirectly) controlled by U.S. persons.178\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 336-337.\n\nJurisdiction Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 352-355.\n\n***(04) The Tribunal's Analysis and Decisions***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n5.27.\n\nPursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Centre's jurisdiction extends to: \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State which *the parties to the dispute consent in writing* to submit to the Centre\" (emphasis supplied).\n\n5.28.\n\nArticle 15 of the Investment Law, provides, in material part: \"In the case of disputes arising between foreign investors and the State, regarding their investment in El Salvador, the investors may submit the dispute to: (a) the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), in order to settle the dispute by means of conciliation and arbitration, in accordance with the Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Among States and Nationals of other States (ICSID Convention)\". The full texts of Article 15 in Spanish and English are set out in the Annex to Part I above.\n\n5.29.\n\nAs summarized above, the Parties disagree on the interpretation of Article 15. Whilst the Claimant submits that the Respondent there consented to ICSID jurisdiction, the Respondent denies that Article 15 provides such consent under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. In order to determine the meaning of Article 15, the Tribunal considers, as confirmed by other ICSID tribunals, that its jurisdiction is to be assessed by reference to the following general principles.\n\n5.30.\n\nFirst, under Article 41 (1) of the ICSID Convention, it is for the Tribunal, as the judge of its competence and not for State authorities or national courts,179 to determine the basis of that competence, whether it be derived from a treaty or a unilateral offer made in legislation and subsequently accepted in writing by the investor.180\n\n*Mobil v.

Canada)* - 4 December 1998 - ICJ Reports 1988 page 432.\n\n5.32.\n\nThird, the question arises as to which legal rules of interpretation (here Salvadoran domestic rules or international rules) apply to the State's consent to arbitration contained not in a treaty but in a unilateral act of a State, i.e. in the present case national legislation such as Article 15 of the Investment Law.\n\n5.33.\n\nAs established by the International Court of Justice when interpreting optional declarations of compulsory jurisdiction made by States under Article 36 (2) of the ICJ Statute182 and as adopted recently by other ICSID tribunals,183 legislation and unilateral acts by which a State consents to ICSID jurisdiction are to be considered as standing offers to foreign investors under the ICSID Convention and interpreted according to the ICSID Convention and under the rules of international law governing unilateral declarations of States.\n\n*Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria*, Preliminary Objections - ICJ Reports 1998 page 291 \u00a7 25; *Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

Venezuela*, *supra* note 179, \u00a7 79.\n\n5.34.\n\nAs explained by the *Mobil* and *Cemex* tribunals,184 whilst the ICJ has decided that a restrictive interpretation should apply when construing acts formulated by States in the exercise of their freedom to act on the international plane, rules of interpretation differ when unilateral acts are formulated in the framework and on the basis of a treaty such as, in the present case, the multilateral ICSID Convention.\n\n*Mobil v. Venezuela*, *supra* note 27, \u00a7\u00a7 86-96; *Cemex v. Venezuela*, *supra* note 179, \u00a7\u00a7 80-89.\n\n5.35.\n\nIn such cases, declarations must be interpreted as they stand, having regard to the words actually used185 and taking into consideration \"the intention of the government at the time it made the declaration.\"186 Such intention can be inferred from the text, but also from the context, the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served by the declaration.187 In doing so, the relevant words should be interpreted in a natural and reasonable way.\n\n*Anglo-Iranian Oil Co*.- Preliminary objection - Judgement - ICJ Reports 1952 page 105.\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v.

Venezuela*, *supra* note 179, \u00a7\u00a7 85-89.\n\n5.36.\n\nApplying these principles, the Tribunal returns to the wording of Article 15 of the Investment Law, providing that, in the case of disputes arising between foreign investors and the Respondent, regarding their investment in El Salvador, \"the investors may submit the dispute to\" [ICSID]. As noted above, the Tribunal determines that Article 15 of the Investment Law, formulated in the framework and on the basis of the ICSID Convention to which it explicitly refers, must be interpreted having regard to the words actually used, interpreted in a natural and reasonable way.\n\n5.37.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that the wording of Article 15 is clear and unambiguous. By providing foreign investors with the option (\"may\"), absent for local investors, of submitting the \"disputes arising between foreign investors and the State, regarding their investment in El Salvador\" to ICSID, Article 15 of the Investment Law clearly invites foreign investors to decide whether to submit their claims to local courts (Article 15, first paragraph) or to ICSID tribunals (Article 15, second paragraph, (a) and (b)), therefore providing the consent of the Respondent required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention which the investor can accept.\n\n5.38.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, nothing in the ICSID Convention establishes the need for specific wording in national legislation or other unilateral acts by which a State consents to ICSID jurisdiction, still less the identical wording used in other instruments of consent used by that State historically (whether in BITs or CAFTA). Consent must be evident and in writing;188 and, in the Tribunal's opinion, both requirements were duly met in the present case by the Respondent, as later accepted in writing by the Claimant in commencing these ICSID arbitration proceedings.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention, \u00a7 23.\n\n5.39.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal decides that the wording of Article 15 of the Investment Law contains the Respondent\u2019s consent to submit the resolution of disputes with foreign investors to ICSID jurisdiction; that such intention appears unambiguously from the text of Article 15; and that it is confirmed from the context, the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served by Article 15, read with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.189 Although the Tribunal has reached this decision based on the language of Article 15 alone, the Tribunal also notes that, confronted with the extraneous evidence adduced by the Claimant to this same effect,190 the Respondent chose not to provide to the Tribunal any rebuttal evidence indicating that it was not the intention of the Salvadoran legislature to provide for unilateral consent to ICSID arbitration in Article 15 the Investment Law.\n\n*Mobil v. Venezuela*, *supra* note 27, \u00a7\u00a7 92-96; *Cemex v. Venezuela*, *supra* note 179, \u00a7\u00a7 85-89.\n\nSee the power point presentation made before the Salvadoran Congress when the Investment Law bill was debated, CL-149, an UNCTAD Report alleged to have been made with input from PROESA and other Government officials, CL 147 and the academic opinions of Professors Schreuer and Oliva de la Cotera referred by the Claimant.\n\n5.40.\n\nAs also summarized above, the Parties also debated the effect to be given to paragraph 332 of the *Inceysa* award.191 While it is correct that the *Inceysa* tribunal declined jurisdiction and dismissed the claimant\u2019s claims on the basis that the investment did not meet the conditions for legality, the tribunal also interpreted Article 15 of the Investment Law in a manner which accords with the interpretation separately reached by this Tribunal.\n\nSee *Inceysa v. El Salvador*, *supra* note 180, \u00a7 332 (\"The foregoing clearly indicates that the Salvadoran State, by Article 15 of the Investment Law, made to the foreign investors a unilateral offer of consent to submit, if the foreign investor so decides, to the jurisdiction of the Centre, to hear all ' *disputes referring to* *investments \u2019* arising between El Salvador and the investor in question. However, in the case at hand, as indicated in the previous paragraphs, Inceysa cannot enjoy the rights granted by said Investment Law because its ' *investment* ' does not meet the conditions of legality\").\n\n5.41.\n\nWith respect to Article 146 of the Salvadoran Constitution,192 the Tribunal does not find such provision incompatible or inconsistent with the consent provided to ICSID jurisdiction in Article 15 of the Investment Law. Article 146 is included in Title VI, Chapter I, Third Section of the Salvadoran Constitution under the heading \"Tratados\" (Treaties). As the plain reading of Article 146 indicates, the purpose of such provision is to limit what may or may not be negotiated in a treaty or concession. Article 146 allows the Salvadoran State to submit disputes to arbitration or to an international tribunal in treaties or contracts as a qualification to the restrictions made earlier in the Constitution;193 and it should be read in such context (i.e. what treaties or concession contracts can contain or not). The Respondent\u2019s interpretation, limiting the instruments by which the Respondent can consent to ICSID arbitration so as to exclude laws and other instruments not referred by in Article 146, does not have, in the Tribunal's opinion, any rational or other legal support.\n\nArticle 146 of the Salvadoran Constitution provides that: \"No podr\u00e1n celebrarse o ratificarse tratados u otorgarse concesiones en que de alguna manera se altere la forma de gobierno o se lesionen o menoscaben la integridad del territorio, la soberan\u00eda e independencia de la Rep\u00fablica o los derechos y garant\u00edas fundamentales de la persona humana. Lo dispuesto en el inciso anterior se aplica a los tratados internacionales o contratos con gobiernos o empresas nacionales o internacionales en los cuales se someta el Estado salvadore\u00f1o, a la jurisdicci\u00f3n de un tribunal de un estado extranjero. Lo anterior no impide que, tanto en los tratados con en los contratos, el Estado salvadore\u00f1o en caso de controversia, someta la decisi\u00f3n a un arbitraje o a un tribunal internacionales\". (\"Treaties shall not be entered into or ratified, nor shall any concessions be granted that would in any way alter the form of government or damage or diminish the territorial integrity, sovereignty, or independence of the Republic or the fundamental rights and guarantees of individuals. The provisions of the previous paragraph shall apply to all international treaties or agreements entered into which governments or domestic or international companies in which the Salvadoran State is subject to the jurisdiction of a tribunal of a foreign state. The aforementioned does not prevent the Salvadoran State from submitting, in treaties and contracts, to arbitration or to an international tribunal for a decision in the event of a dispute\".)\n\n\"Lo anterior no impide...\" (the aforementioned does not prevent...)\n\n5.42.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds no merit in the Respondent\u2019s argument that if Article 15 constituted consent, the Claimant\u2019s claims were precluded for failing to initiate conciliation before arbitration. The conjunction \"and\" in Article 15 of the Investment Law can only mean that both dispute settlement mechanisms provided by the ICSID Convention are available to the Claimant. Once consent has been given by the Respondent (as it is in the form of Article 15), it is for the party instituting the proceedings to choose between conciliation and arbitration under the ICSID Convention.194\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, *supra* note 180, \u00a7 102, R. Dolzer and C. Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law,* at page 221 (2008).\n\n5.43.\n\nWith regard to the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Investment Law is not applicable to the Claimant because of its lack of any investments in El Salvador, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant's nationality (and subsequent change of nationality) is irrelevant for the purpose of it qualifying as a \"foreign investor\" under the Investment Law.195 The Claimant was registered as a \"foreign investor\" for the purposes of the Investment Law from 2005;196 it was successively a Cayman Island company prior to 13 December 2007 and a US company thereafter; and the Claimant, as such, could have invoked Article 15 of the Investment Law by virtue of the respective ratifications of the ICSID Convention by the United Kingdom and the USA, which (in the case of the United Kingdom) extended to the Cayman Islands.\n\nArticle 2 (d) of the Investment Law provides the following definition \"Inversionista Extranjero: Las personas naturales y jur\u00eddicas extranjeras y los salvadore\u00f1os radicados en el exterior por m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o ininterrumpido, que realicen inversiones en el pa\u00eds\" (\"Foreign Investor: The foreign natural and legal persons and the Salvadoran nationals established abroad for more than one ininterrupted year that make investments in the country\").\n\nTo this respect, Article 17 of the Investment Law provides that \"Los inversionistas extranjeros deber\u00e1n registrar sus inversiones en la ONI, quien emitir\u00e1 una Credencial la cual le otorgar\u00e1 a su titular la calidad de inversionista extranjero, con expresi\u00f3n de la inversi\u00f3n registrada\" (Foreign investors shall register their investments before ONI, who will issue a credential that will provide to its bearer the quality of foreign investor, expressing the foreign investment\". See MINEC Resolution No. 288-R (21 June 2005), C-36 and MINEC Resolutions No. 368-MR (30 July 2008) and No. 387 MR (13 August 2008), C-12.\n\n5.44.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s next submission raises the question of the Claimant\u2019s actual investments in El Salvador. The definition of \"a foreign investor\" contained in the Investment Law is broad; and, as confirmation of this interpretation, the Tribunal notes that register of the Respondent\u2019s Ministry of Economy shows that the Salvadoran Government had always treated the Claimant as a foreign investor.197 In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, it is therefore unnecessary here to enter in any factual analysis of the precise origin or timing of funds invested in El Salvador by or on behalf of the Claimant to conclude that the Claimant is a foreign investor for the purpose of Article 15 of the Investment law.\n\nSee MINEC Resolution No.368-MR (30 July 2008), C-12, page 10: \"That pursuant to the records of foreign capital kept by the Ministry, the company PAC RIM CAYMAN LLC, domiciled in the State of Nevada, United States of America, has registered and invested in national companies as follows:....\", C-12.\n\n5.45.\n\nWith regards to the question relating to the CAFTA waiver raised by the Respondent, the Tribunal considers that it fully addressed this same question in its Decision of 2 August 2010;198 and it here confirms that answer. In particular, the Tribunal finds no juridical difficulty in having an ICSID arbitration based on different claims arising from separate investment protections and separate but identical arbitration provisions, here CAFTA and the Investment Law.199 To the contrary, when consent to the same tribunal's jurisdiction is contained in two or more instruments, the Respondent\u2019s suggestion that different ICSID arbitrations must be commenced under each instrument would render nugatory the natural inclinations of both investors and States for fairness, consistency and procedural efficiency in international arbitration.\n\nPac Rim Cayman v. The Republic of El Salvador, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, 2 August 2010, \u00a7\u00a7 252253.\n\nSee *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, where the tribunal analysed the possibility of intervening in the case both under the Energy Charter Treaty and the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT. The fact that it finally decided not to do so on the basis that the MFN existing in this BIT did not provide consent to ICSID arbitration under the BIT does not alter such conclusion. Under the reasoning of that tribunal, if consent would have been present, the tribunal would have been acting in the same proceeding on two different legal bases, both of which provided for ICSID arbitration. Id. *Cemex v. Venezuela* and *Mobil v. Venezuela*, where the tribunals admitted the possibility of hearing two sets of claims (under the Venezuelan Investment Law and the Venezuela-Netherlands BIT) in the same proceeding, although they finally declined its jurisdiction under the Investment Law because it did not provide consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n5.46.\n\nAs regards indivisibility, the Tribunal repeats paragraph 253 of its Decision of 2 August 2010:\n\n*\"In the Tribunal's view, these arbitration proceedings are indivisible, being the same single ICSID arbitration between the same Parties before the same Tribunal in receipt of the same Notice of Arbitration registered once by the ICSID Acting Secretary-General under the ICSID Convention. To decide otherwise would require an interpretation of CAFTA Article 10.18 (2) wholly at odds with its object and purpose and potentially resulting in gross unfairness to a claimant. There is no corresponding* *unfairness to the Respondent in maintaining these ICSID proceedings as one single arbitration. In particular, the Respondent does not here face any practical risk of double jeopardy. Lastly, it is hardly a legitimate objection to this Tribunal's competence that it exercises jurisdiction over* *these Parties based not upon one consent to such jurisdiction from the* *Respondent but based upon two cumulative consents from the Respondent. It is an indisputable historical fact that several arbitration tribunals have exercised jurisdiction based on more than one consent from one disputant party, without being thereby deprived of jurisdiction.\"*\n\n5.47.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that these ICSID arbitration proceedings are indivisible; but it does not consider that the Claimant\u2019s claims are indivisible, given the Tribunal\u2019s decision above to deny any jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA claims. What now remains in these ICSID proceedings for decision on the merits are the Claimant\u2019s non-CAFTA claims; and the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to decide these claims in this ICSID arbitration cannot be affected by its rejection of the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA Claims under this Decision. To this extent, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant\u2019s submission that: \". Claimant commenced this proceeding by both invoking CAFTA and the Investment Law, and the Tribunal has already held that this dual invocation of consent did not violate Claimant's waiver provision. Where the *commencement* of the proceeding did not violate the waiver, it can hardly be imagined that its *continuation* would somehow do so, regardless of which claims go forward and which do not...\"200\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, \u00a7111.\n\n5.48.\n\n***Decisions:*** For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides to reject the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on Article 15 of the Investment Law and to accept jurisdiction to decide on their merits the Non-CAFTA claims pleaded by the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration (incorporating its Notice of Intent). This decision is strictly limited to the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection: it does not and will not affect any issue, whether legal or factual, as to the merits or demerits of any of the Claimant\u2019s non-CAFTA claims or any of the Respondent\u2019s as yet formally unpleaded defences to such claims.\n\n***PART 6: ISSUE E - LEGAL AND ARBITRA TION COSTS***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***(01) Introduction***\n-----------------------\n\n6.1.\n\nThe Parties made submissions on the legal and arbitration costs incurred to date in their respective written submissions on costs of 10 June 2011 and their reply submissions on costs of 24 June 2011.\n\n6.2.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant claims legal costs US$ 4,338,744; and the Respondent claims legal costs US$ 4,057,719.96, together with arbitration costs of approximately US$ 250,000. These claims are denied in full by the Respondent and the Claimant respectively.\n\n6.3.\n\nThis issue as to costs arises under ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(1) and CAFTA Article 10.20.4 & 10.20.6 (cited in the Annex to Part 1 above). It also arises under Paragraph 266(3) of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of 2 August 2010, whereby the Tribunal reserved its powers to order costs under CAFTA Article 10.20.6 until the final stage of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n6.4.\n\nGiven the conduct of this arbitration to date and the Parties\u2019 respective allegations of misconduct made against each other, together with the significant sums involved in this costs issue before these proceedings have even reached the actual merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to set out the Parties\u2019 respective submissions on costs at some length in this Decision.\n\n***(02) The Claimant's Claim***\n-------------------------------\n\n6.5.\n\nIn summary,201 the Claimant requests the Tribunal to order the Respondent to bear all the costs of these arbitration proceedings to date.\n\nThis summary of the Claimant\u2019s claim and the Claimant\u2019s response below are based on the Claimant\u2019s written submissions on costs of 10 and 24 June 2011.\n\n6.6.\n\nThe Claimant acknowledges that an award or allocation of costs typically accompanies a final award. It submits, however, that ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(1) also allows this Tribunal to make an interim determination of costs at any stage of these proceedings, relying upon Professor Schreuer\u2019s commentary on the ICSID Convention:\n\n*\"The apportionment of costs need not relate to the entire proceeding. The Tribunal may charge one party the costs or a major share of the costs of a particular part of the proceeding. Often this will be in reaction to undesirable conduct by a party in the proceedings.... A party whose conduct has necessitated a particular measure may have to bear the resulting costs.\"*202\n\nSchreuer (et al), *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed), p. 1231.\n\n6.7.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent should now bear all the costs of its objections; and that the Tribunal should proceed to allocate such costs in its decision (not award) on jurisdiction, for the several reasons which follow.\n\n6.8.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, other than CAFTA Article 10.20.6 which provides that the Tribunal \"shall\" consider whether a party's positions were \"frivolous\" in exercising its discretion to award \"reasonable costs and attorney's fees\" following an objection made under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 or 10.20.5, the cost provisions of CAFTA, the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules do not provide any particular standard for tribunals to use in determining how to allocate costs.\n\n6.9.\n\nHowever, so the Claimant submits, both arbitration tribunals and learned commentators recognize that costs may be allocated against a party as a sanction for procedural misconduct, or simply as a response and, hopefully, a deterrent to undesirable conduct by a party in the proceedings. For example, according to the Claimant, tribunals have awarded costs against a respondent which delayed the arbitration and increased the costs of the arbitration by making multiple objections and motions; against a respondent which submitted its objections with considerable delay, leading to an unnecessary escalation in the costs of the claimant; and against a claimant whose characterisation of the evidence was unacceptably slanted and whose submissions had been without adequate foundation.\n\n6.10.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, under ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(1)(b), ICSID tribunals have ordered a party to bear the costs of a specific part of the proceedings where that part was requested or caused by that party and where the tribunal concluded that it would be unfair for the other party to bear such costs. For example, in rejecting the claimant's request for supplementary decisions and rectification following the award in *Genin v. Estonia*, the tribunal decided:\n\n*\"The Claimants had their \"day in court. \" In fact, they had their week before the Tribunal. Not content with the result, they initiated further proceedings, as was their right, making the Request which the Tribunal hereby denies.\"*203\n\nAccordingly, that tribunal ordered the claimant to pay in full the expenses incurred by the parties, as well as the additional costs of the arbitration.\n\n*Alex Genin and others v. Republic of Estonia***,** ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Decision on Claimants' Request for Supplementary Decisions and Rectification, 4 April 2002, \u00a7 19.\n\n6.11.\n\nThe Claimant contends that an allocation of costs against the Respondent is more than warranted in the present case: the Respondent has employed its full procedural arsenal to make the dual preliminary objections phases of this arbitration as long and expensive as possible; the Respondent has raised every argument (factual and legal) that it could devise, regardless of its merit or even plausibility; and the Respondent has consistently made highly charged but utterly baseless allegations of \"concealment,\" \"deceit,\" and \"bad faith\" against the Claimant, including the Claimant\u2019s Counsel.\n\n6.12.\n\nThe Claimant submits that its request for an allocation of costs against the Respondent is warranted even if the Tribunal were to limit its consideration to the Respondent's conduct during the course of this second jurisdictional phase of these arbitration proceedings. However, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal should consider the Respondent's conduct during both preliminary phases, particularly as its conduct in this second phase has only underscored the improper tactical motivations that have underlain its handling of this case from the outset of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n6.13.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent decided at the outset that it would \"bifurcate\" its preliminary objections. Thus, on 4 January 2010, the Respondent launched its Preliminary Objections under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5. Although objections under Article 10.20.4 must be made \"as a matter of law\" and assuming the Claimant's factual allegations \"to be true,\" the Respondent made innumerable factual arguments that it plainly knew to be disputed by the Claimant. Indeed, those arguments necessitated the submission of 54 exhibits consisting of nearly 800 pages of material, notwithstanding that the Preliminary Objections were supposed to be based on the facts as alleged by Claimant in the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n6.14.\n\nIn the meantime, so the Claimant contends, the Respondent was preparing its second set of jurisdictional objections even as its Preliminary Objections were still being prepared. For example, by 1 March 2010, the Respondent had already carried out a full \"investigation\", which, so the Respondent informed the United States Government, \"conclusively\" proved that it was entitled to deny the Claimant the benefits of CAFTA; when the Respondent filed its Objections to Jurisdiction on 3 August 2010 (literally within hours of the Tribunal's Decision of 2 August 2010), the Respondent based its arguments largely, if not entirely, on the same grounds that purportedly supported its case in the letter of 1 March 2010 to the USA (although the Respondent failed to provide either the Claimant or the Tribunal with such letter until 3 September 2010).\n\n6.15.\n\nFurthermore, so the Claimant contends, given the nature of the two sets of objections, there is no legitimate reason why the Respondent could not have asserted them together. The Claimant submits that the arguments included in the Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction are no more fact-intensive than those that the Respondent put forward in its first round of objections under CAFTA Article 10.20.4. Thus, so the Claimant contends, the information on which the Respondent based its letter dated 1 March 2010 to the USA (as well as the Respondent\u2019s subsequent denial of benefits to the Claimant) consists almost entirely of the Claimant\u2019s own public filings or other information that the Claimant had made publicly available. In turn, the Respondent's Objection to Jurisdiction based on Abuse of Process is, according to the Claimant, largely based on the same underlying facts as the Objection based on Denial of Benefits; the facts required to demonstrate that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis (i.e. the continued existence of a ban on mining in El Salvador) are not contested by the Respondent; and the issue of the Respondent's consent to ICSID arbitration under the Investment Law is an issue of legal interpretation, without any relevant factual dispute.\n\n6.16.\n\nIn contrast, the Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections were based (inter alia) on numerous internal documents from the Respondent\u2019s regulatory agencies which had never been provided to the Claimant, numerous alleged communications between the Claimant and the Respondent (often alleged by the Respondent without any evidential support), complex issues involving the application of Salvadoran mining and environmental laws and regulations to the Claimant's applications for an environmental permit and exploitation concession, and various assertions concerning highly technical aspects of the applications and the project itself.\n\n6.17.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that there is no legitimate reason for the Respondent to have withheld its jurisdictional objections in reserve until after the Tribunal's Decision of 2 August 2010. Moreover, the Claimant contends that none of the Respondent\u2019s objections submitted under CAFTA Article 10.20 (with the possible exception of the waiver issue under CAFTA Article 10.18.2) should have been raised at the preliminary phase of the proceedings. The Claimant submits that the Respondent's decision to submit such inappropriately fact-intensive Preliminary Objections, even as it was already preparing its Jurisdictional Objections for later submission to the Tribunal, was aimed solely at multiplying the preliminary phases of these arbitration proceedings, thereby deliberately delaying any adjudication on the merits and imposing additional costs on the Claimant.\n\n6.18.\n\nThe Claimant next contends, putting aside the Respondent's \"bifurcation\" of its preliminary objections, that the Respondent\u2019s conduct during this second phase of these proceedings standing alone, more than merits an order for costs in favour of the Claimant: the entire theme of the Respondent' jurisdictional objections is that the Claimant secretly changed its nationality from that of the Cayman Islands to that of the USA; that the Claimant \"tried to conceal this abuse through misleading words and actions;\" and that the Respondent\u2019s objections \"exposed Claimant's change of nationality.\" The Claimant contends that the Respondent persisted in its allegations that the Claimant failed to disclose its change in nationality, even as it was pointed out to the Respondent that the Claimant had duly notified the Respondent\u2019s Government of the Claimant\u2019s domestication to Nevada, USA, long before the commencement of this ICSID arbitration; and that the change in nationality from that of the Cayman Islands to that of the USA was again disclosed in the exhibits to the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration.\n\n6.19.\n\nAt the Hearing, so the Claimant submits, the Respondent (having repeatedly accused the Claimant of \"bad faith,\" \"concealment,\" and \"deceit\") effectively conceded that there was no evidence to support any of these inflammatory allegations. Instead, the Respondent was reduced to arguing that the Respondent did not have to show any bad faith on the part of the Claimant, because bad faith is \"inherent in this type of abuse [of process].\" That assertion, so the Claimant contends, is without any merit as a matter of international law (given that good faith is always to be presumed); but, more important for present purposes is the fact that the Respondent was forced to make this concession at all. The Claimant submits that the Respondent's attempt to \"imply\" bad faith into the Claimant's conduct is illustrative of its tendency to make serious allegations against the Claimant that are either contradicted by the record or that turn out to be completely unsupported.\n\n6.20.\n\nThe Claimant submits that many of the tactics employed by the Respondent throughout this case, for example the tendency to offer unacceptably distorted assertions of fact and law; to make accusations and insinuations that were utterly without support and to hold back various allegations or information until the last minute in an effort to ambush the Claimant, were dramatically on display in the proffered testimony of the Respondent's own counsel, Mr Parada. The Claimant contends that Mr Parada\u2019s witness statement was offered only after the written phase for the Respondent's jurisdictional objections was closed and even though the Respondent maintained that the \"information\" contained in his testimony was the basis for the Respondent's documentary and other requests made in September 2010.\n\n6.21.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, as the Respondent's counsel acknowledged as he began his direct examination of Mr Parada, \"it's quite extraordinary for a counsel for a Party to also put in a witness statement.\" Indeed, so the Claimant contends, it is not only extraordinary; but it is also strongly discouraged and often prohibited.\n\n6.22.\n\nThe Claimant cites the American Bar Association's Model Rules on Professional Responsibility which specifically prohibit a lawyer from acting as an advocate in a trial in which the lawyer is also likely to be a witness (absent several limited exceptions inapplicable here):\n\n*\"[a] lawyer shall not act as an advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness unless: (1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue; (2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or (3) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.\"*\n\nThe Claimant also cites the United States Supreme Court\u2019s observation that in some cases it may be unseemly, especially where counsel is in a position to comment on his own testimony; and that the practice of being an advocate and witness in the same case should be discouraged, the reasons for such discouragement being numerous, including, the danger of intruding upon attorney-client privilege and the fundamentally different roles played by advocates and witnesses.204\n\n*French v. Hall*, 119 U.S. 152, 154 (1886), citing also *Ferraro v. Taylor*, 197 Minn. 5, 12, 265 N.W. 829, 833 (1936).\n\n6.23.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Mr Parada's clashing roles of advocate and witness were evident at the Hearing, for example, when he asserted in his opening argument that he could definitively describe the position that the Respondent had taken in *Inceysa* (because he had worked at Arnold & Porter, the firm which represented the Respondent in that case); but he then admitted as a witness in cross-examination that he had left Arnold & Porter before the jurisdictional objections in that case were filed by the Respondent.\n\n6.24.\n\nFurther, so the Claimant submits, Mr Parada's testimony was marked by other inconsistencies and absurdities: Mr Parada testified that during a recruiting breakfast interview in December 2007, two of the Claimant's counsel (i.e. Messrs. Ali and de Gramont of Crowell & Moring) told him of their client\u2019s plans to commence arbitration proceedings against the Respondent; according to Mr Parada, Messrs. Ali and de Gramont divulged this confidential client information even though Mr Parada had told them of his close and long-standing professional ties to the Salvadoran Government; Mr Parada further testified that Mr Ali told him that he (Mr Ali) had met the week before with President Saca to inform the President that Mr Ali's client intended to initiate arbitration against the Respondent under CAFTA; however, as Mr Parada testified, he (Mr Parada) had concluded that the true purpose of the interview was that Crowell & Moring wanted Mr Parada to inform the Respondent of Mr Ali\u2019s plans; and, notwithstanding Mr Parada's \"conclusion\" about the real reason for the interview, Mr Parada also testified that Messrs. Ali and de Gramont \"invited\" him to join Crowell & Moring's international arbitration practice, even as they were planning to commence an ICSID arbitration against the Respondent and even though Mr Parada had told them that he \"would be extremely uncomfortable working on an ICSID arbitration against El Salvador\".\n\n6.25.\n\nThe Claimant submits that any counsel appearing before this Tribunal (as counsel or as a witness) has an obligation to make sure that his assertions, especially assertions of such a serious nature, have a basic foundation. According to the Claimant, the modus operandi of the Respondent has been to suggest or insinuate wrongdoing on the part of the Claimant without any regard for whether such suggestions have any foundation at all. The Respondent retained its own counsel (Dewey & LeBoeuf) by April 2009 at the latest, so that the Respondent had more than two years to confirm the foundations for its several allegations; but the Respondent significantly failed to do so.\n\n6.26.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that, if the Tribunal were again in its jurisdictional decision to decline to allocate costs against the Respondent following this second phase of objections (as it did with its Decision of 2 August 2010 following the first phase), the Respondent will have been well rewarded for its misconduct; and the Respondent will have succeeded (again) in delaying the merits phase of this arbitration and in imposing yet more expense on the Claimant, with its limited resources. Moreover, so the Claimant further concludes, a decision by the Tribunal not to order costs against the Respondent will ensure that the Respondent will continue such misconduct as this arbitration proceeds to the merits; and it would strongly encourage other miscreant parties to engage in the same misconduct in future arbitration proceedings. Indeed, so the Claimant submits, the Respondent will have created a \"blueprint\" as to how all CAFTA respondents can double the length of the period for objections and deplete the resources of all but the best-funded CAFTA claimants.\n\n6.27.\n\nThe Claimant submits, as to arbitration costs, that according to the interim financial statement as of 3 June 2011 issued by the ICSID Secretariat, the Centre's total disbursements as of that date totalled US $311,025.77 to which the Claimant has contributed US $249,962.00. As to its own legal costs, the Claimant submits the following statement:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| *I: First Phase of Objections:* |\n| C&M Legal Fees  C&M Disbursements  Expert fees of Professor Don Wallace, Jr.  Total C&M Fees and Disbursements for First Phase: | US$ 1,791,297 US$ 72,566  US$ 35,625 US$1,899,488 |\n| *II: Second Phase of Objections:* |  |\n| C&M Legal Fees  C&M Disbursements  Total C&M Fees and Disbursements for Second Phase: | US$2,355,713  US$ 83,543  US$2,439,256 |\n| *Total Fees and Disbursements for Both Phases:* | *US$4,338,744* |\n\n6.28.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal issue an order allocating to the Respondent all the arbitration and legal costs of these proceedings to date.\n\n***(03) The Respondent's Response***\n------------------------------------\n\n6.29.\n\nIn summary,205 by way of response to the Claimant\u2019s case on costs, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimant to bear all the costs incurred by the Respondent in this arbitration because the Claimant initiated this arbitration about a mining exploitation concession which it did not have a right to receive, abusing the international arbitration process, and because it also has made a series of false, misleading and inconsistent statements before this Tribunal to try to keep its claims alive.\n\nThis summary of the Respondent\u2019s response and the Respondent\u2019s claim below are based on the Respondent\u2019s written submissions on costs of 10 and 24 June 2011.\n\n6.30.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Hearing confirmed that this arbitration is the result of an abuse of process by the Claimant and others: the Canadian company, Pacific Rim, had a dispute with the Respondent about its application for a mining exploitation concession in El Dorado; it spent three years trying to resolve the dispute by lobbying the Respondent\u2019s Government to change its Mining Law; those years of unsuccessful lobbying efforts made resolving that dispute appear increasingly unlikely; the Canadian company engaged international arbitration lawyers and then changed the nationality of its subsidiary (the Claimant) in December 2007 in order to procure arbitral jurisdiction under CAFTA for its pre-existing dispute with the Respondent.\n\n6.31.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant, unable to contest the overwhelming evidence that the dispute existed before its change of nationality in December 2007, has instead repeatedly tried to change its definition of the \"measure at issue\" and its explanation of when the dispute arose between the Parties. This tactical shifting of positions, according to the Respondent, has been the Claimant\u2019s common practice throughout this arbitration.\n\n6.32.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, unlike the Claimant, the Respondent has pursued its objections honestly and in good faith, seeking the quickest and most efficient resolution possible: the Respondent brought Preliminary Objections in an attempt to end this arbitration with the least expenditure of time and expense; only after extensive written submissions and denials in the Preliminary Objections phase did the Claimant accept that: (i) it never had a \"perfected right\" to a concession; and (ii) it had known of problems with its application and chose to try to lobby the Respondent\u2019s Government to change its legal requirements instead of complying with them.\n\n6.33.\n\nIn this jurisdictional phase, the Respondent submits that the Claimant sought to disregard its own nationality and relevant treaty provisions, wrongly insisting on its right to arbitrate even though it does not qualify to initiate CAFTA claims or to invoke ICSID jurisdiction against the Respondent; and that the Claimant again wasted time and expense before accepting these straightforward facts. The Respondent cites, as one example, the Claimant\u2019s continuous invocation of the activities of the \"Pacific Rim Companies\" to suggest that the Claimant had activities in the USA, even though it was forced to admit that the Claimant is a passive holding company with no activities beyond holding shares on paper.\n\n6.34.\n\nThe Respondent contends that these essential facts were not complicated; that these jurisdictional objections could have been argued concisely; but that the Claimant submitted a 256-page Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial and a 186-page Jurisdiction Rejoinder, sticking to the tactic: \"if the facts are against you, focus on the law; if the law is against you, focus on the facts; if the law and the facts are against you, create distractions and confusion.\"\n\n6.35.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant cannot hide from the true facts of this case: this dispute relates to the application for an environmental permit that was presumptively denied by the Respondent. By early 2007 at the latest, the Claimant knew that the concession application could not be approved until it either revised and resubmitted the application or succeeded in its efforts to change the Mining Law; but Pacific Rim changed the Claimant\u2019s nationality to the USA in December 2007 and later began these arbitration proceedings.\n\n6.36.\n\nThe Respondent contends that in all these circumstances, having been unfairly subjected to the Claimant\u2019s abusive process and to its abusive tactics and misconduct in this arbitration, the Respondent should not be required to bear any of the Claimant\u2019s costs but, rather, that it is entitled to recover its own costs from the Claimant, as submitted (in summary) below.\n\n***(04) The Respondent's Claim***\n---------------------------------\n\n6.37.\n\nThe Respondent notes, as a preliminary matter, that costs only need to be addressed at this stage if the Tribunal decides that it lacks jurisdiction as established by the Respondent; and that, as the Tribunal indicated when instructing the Parties to address costs with their post-hearing submissions, \"obviously on one view of what happens with our decision, we may have to address costs, and that's the claim... which is made by the Respondent.\"206 Thus, according to the Respondent, despite the Claimant's efforts to argue the contrary, the Claimant's claim for costs would only be relevant if the Claimant were to prevail at the end of this arbitration.\n\nHearing D3,764.\n\n6.38.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal has already seen enough to conclude without hesitation that this arbitration must end now unfavourably for the Claimant. The Respondent submits that the evidence establishes that this arbitration has been abusive by the Claimant at different levels, beginning with Pacific Rim\u2019s manipulation of the Claimant's nationality to manufacture jurisdiction under CAFTA; followed by the lack of merit in the Claimant\u2019s main claim (an asserted entitlement to a mining exploitation concession which the Claimant in fact did not have any right to receive); and finally the manner in which the Claimant has conducted this arbitration; all leading to the result that this entire arbitration should now be dismissed with an award at this jurisdictional phase; and accordingly that costs could and should be awarded to the Respondent and against the Claimant.\n\n6.39.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that, even if the Claimant's costs claim were somehow relevant, its claim was filed in contravention of the Tribunal's instructions to include \"a brief summary as regards both allocation and quantification of costs that are being sought by both sides\" with the Post-Hearing Submissions, which the Tribunal indicated was to have a maximum length of fifty pages. Rather than abide by the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, the Claimant requested flexibility on the page limit and then abused the Tribunal's indulgence in granting such flexibility by filing a separate thir-teen-page written submission on costs, in addition to its full fifty-page Post-Hearing Submissions. The Claimant thus circumvented the page-limit for the post-hearing submissions, seeking to gain an unfair advantage over the Respondent; whereas the Respondent fully abided by the Tribunal's fifty-page limit. Accordingly, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's separate costs submission should be considered inadmissible by the Tribunal.\n\n6.40.\n\nNevertheless, the Respondent states that, because the Claimant's costs submission has been filed with the Tribunal as a part of the public record and includes many misrepresentations, the Respondent is obliged to respond at length.\n\n6.41.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that it did not \"bifurcate\" its objections to cause delay, but to ensure that the Claimant's unmeritorious claims could be dismissed as efficiently as possible; that the Claimant argued in the Preliminary Objections phase that the Respondent brought too many objections; but that the Claimant now argues that the Respondent, rather than limiting its Preliminary Objections, should have added even more objections. In fact, the Respondent submits that it properly refrained in the first phase from asserting its Abuse of Process, Denial of Benefits, Ratione Tem-poris Objections (as well as its additional Objection to claims under the Investment Law), because these objections needed to be decided without assuming the Claimant's factual allegations to be true, required consideration of disputed facts, and could not have been properly decided under the strict time-limit for the expedited procedure required by CAFTA Article 10.20.5.\n\n6.42.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that the Preliminary Objections phase served a useful purpose. It raised these Preliminary Objections to present undisputed facts to the Tribunal that exposed fatal weaknesses in the Claimant's claims on the merits that could have resulted in the early dismissal of the primary claims in this arbitration; the Claimant, however, refused to provide additional facts that might have permitted the Tribunal to come to an early decision, merely stating that its claims could not be decided at a preliminary first phase in an expedited proceeding; that whereas the Respondent had hoped to narrow the issues in this arbitration to save time and expense, the Claimant successfully postponed an adverse decision by promising that it would cure the serious weaknesses and deficiencies in the allegations made in the Notice of Arbitration at a later time.\n\n6.44.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, even though the Tribunal decided to allow the arbitration to continue with regard to all the Claimant's claims, the Tribunal noted that the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections had served a useful purpose in the arbitration, as expressed in Paragraph 264 of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of 2 August 2010 (\"... as regards these particular claims, much of the costs so far incurred by the Parties will not have been wasted. Much of the work required to bring these proceedings forward... to a conclusion has now been done. In the Tribunal's view, it is unlikely that much time, effort and expenditure will have been lost overall).\n\n6.45.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Preliminary Objections phase allowed the Tribunal an early look at the weaknesses in the Claimant's claims; that, in addition, the filing of the Preliminary Objections was helpful for the Tribunal's decision in this second jurisdictional phase; that, by having engaged in an early discussion of what the dispute was about (unaffected by a concurrent consideration of the Respondent\u2019s abuse of process objection), the Tribunal was able to see during the first phase that the Parties\u2019 dispute had started well before the Claimant's abusive change of nationality; that had the Respondent not brought its Preliminary Objections before filing its Abuse of Process objection, the Claimant would have without a doubt argued that it was necessary to join the decision on jurisdiction to the merits of the dispute; and that, because the Respondent brought its Preliminary Objections earlier, the Tribunal had the evidence it needed to render an award declining jurisdiction at this stage. Therefore, so the Respondent contends, there is no need to waste more time and resources to reach the same result after a costly phase on the merits, which would have included evidence and arguments on both liability and damages.\n\n6.46.\n\nThird, the Respondent submits that the Claimant, not the Respondent, caused significant delay and unnecessary additional expense in this arbitration: the Respondent is the unwilling party in these proceedings; it was the Claimant which chose to initiate this arbitration; the Claimant should have researched and understood the legal and factual bases for its claims before forcing the Respondent into these arbitration proceedings; had the Claimant done so, the costs of this arbitration could have been avoided; but, instead, the Respondent has had to expend considerable resources to refute claims that should not have been made by the Claimant; and, once these claims were refuted by the Respondent, the Claimant, rather than accepting the consequences, constantly changed its positions on the facts and the law; and it now wrongly accuses the Respondent of \"hold[ing] various allegations or information in reserve until the last minute in an effort to ambush Claimant.\"\n\n6.47.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimant\u2019s complaints of \"ambush\" relate to matters which should not have come as any surprise to the Claimant: (i) the Respondent\u2019s presentation of undisputed evidence in the Preliminary Objections first phase that its Government had considered and rejected the Claimant's proposals to \"interpret\" or amend the Mining Law to eliminate requirements that the Claimant's application for an exploitation concession failed to meet (such as the requirement for ownership or authorisation to use the surface land covering the concession area); and (ii) the Respondent\u2019s early notification to the USA of the Respondent\u2019s intent to deny benefits under CAFTA.\n\n6.48.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this evidence was not presented in order to ambush the Claimant; but, rather, it was presented by the Respondent to prove facts that contradicted the Claimant's case, which the Claimant knew or should have known when it commenced this arbitration but which it did not present to the Tribunal. The Respondent cites, as an example, the fact that the Claimant initiated this arbitration based on a claim that it had met all the requirements for a concession application except for the environmental permit; but when it was presented with the Respondent\u2019s evidence, the Claimant changed its position and admitted that it had been advised of its failure to comply with the surface land ownership requirement in March 2005. The Respondent argues that, after trying at the Preliminary Objections stage to create a complicated dispute regarding the surface land issue, at the jurisdictional stage the Claimant admitted that it had tried to get the Respondent\u2019s Government to interpret or amend the Mining Law to overcome the fact that the company's concession application did not comply with the existing surface land requirement. As for the Respondent\u2019s denial of benefits under CAFTA, so the Respondent argues, that should have come as no surprise to the Claimant, being wholly owned and controlled by a Canadian company, with no substantial business activities of its own in the USA.\n\n6.49.\n\nFourth, the Respondent submits that the Respondent avoided delay by filing its jurisdictional objections immediately, instead of waiting until the due date for the filing of its counter-memorial on the merits (as it was entitled to do under the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules).\n\n6.50.\n\nThe Respondent notes that it (the Respondent), the Claimant, and the Tribunal all knew well in advance of the Tribunal's Decision of 2 August 2010 that some of the Claimant's claims would not be dismissed during this first phase because such claims were not subject to the Preliminary Objections. In keeping with its goal of ending this arbitration as soon as possible, the Respondent decided to prepare immediately to file objections to jurisdiction with regard to any surviving claims. The Respondent was under no obligation to act so expeditiously; and, if it had actually wanted to delay this arbitration and thereby increase the Claimant\u2019s costs, it could have waited for the Claimant to file its memorial on the merits, then raised its objections to jurisdiction and requested the suspension of the proceedings on the merits. The Respondent did not do so.\n\n6.51.\n\nFifth, the Respondent contends that, in this case, there is ample evidence of the Claimant's bad faith. The Respondent notes that the Claimant has asserted that the Respondent was \"reduced to arguing that [the Respondent] did not have to show any bad faith on the part of Claimant, because bad faith is \"inherent in this type of abuse\u2019.\" However, the Respondent submits that it presented ample evidence of the Claimant's bad faith, and, in addition, noted that a tribunal need not find subjective bad faith as an additional element once it is shown that a claimant manipulated its corporate form to gain access to arbitral jurisdiction for an existing dispute, because that manipulation (by itself) constitutes bad faith under international law.\n\n6.52.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant exhibited bad faith when it decided not to mention to the Tribunal the crucial fact of its change of nationality anywhere in the entire text of its Notice of Intent and Notice of Arbitration. Instead, the Claimant only described itself as \"an American investor organized under the laws of Nevada,\" \"a U.S. investor organized under the laws of Nevada,\" and \"a limited liability company duly organized under the laws of the state of Nevada, in the United States of America.\" Nowhere in the 131 paragraphs of the Notice of Arbitration is there any reference to the change of nationality, much less to the date of that change. The Respondent argues that the Claimant's attempts to argue that it provided notice of the change of nationality to the Tribunal by including an exhibit for a different purpose and not translated into English (that happened to include a reference to the change of nationality) are, at best, disingenuous.\n\n6.53.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimant exhibited bad faith in asserting that no one at Pacific Rim had any reason even to suspect there was a dispute with the Respondent until reading a newspaper article in March 2008 reporting President Saca\u2019s speech, after the Claimant\u2019s change of nationality, in spite of all the evidence introduced during the Preliminary Objections first phase about the prior existence of that dispute. The extremity of the Claimant's bad faith in this regard, so the Respondent argues, was revealed when the Claimant's principal witness, Mr Shrake (as the CEO and President of Pacific Rim), denied that the newspaper article alerted him to the relevant measure invoked by the Claimant, namely the alleged de facto ban on mining, which the Claimant now asserts gave rise to the Parties\u2019 present dispute.\n\n6.54.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimant's bad faith was also demonstrated by admissions and proof that other key factual assertions made by the Claimant were similarly false or misleading: (i) the Claimant and its witnesses in their written witness statements repeatedly asserted that saving costs, rather than creating jurisdiction, was \"the primary factor behind\" changing the Claimant's nationality; on oral testimony at the Hearing, however, the Claimant's main witness (Mr Shrake) admitted that saving costs was not the primary reason for the change of nationality; and (ii) the Claimant asserted repeatedly that the Claimant was constantly assured \"through 2007 and into 2008\" that it would receive the environmental permit; the Claimant, however, could not and did not refute the Respondent\u2019s proof at the Hearing that there were no meetings with officials of the Salvadoran administration between January and December 2007; and therefore that there was no possibility that any assurances were given in 2007, the year leading up to the Claimant's change of nationality.\n\n6.55.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent contends that, whilst it was not required to make any additional showing of bad faith once it had demonstrated the improper manipulation of the Claimant\u2019s corporate form in order to gain jurisdiction under CAFTA, it has nonetheless proved the Claimant\u2019s bad faith.\n\n6.56.\n\nSixth, the Respondent submits that Mr Parada's testimony only became necessary as a result of the Claimant's own misconduct. According to the Respondent, Mr Parada never imagined he would be a factual witness in this arbitration until August 2010 when the Claimant, in an effort to survive the Respondent\u2019s Abuse of Process objection, wrongly alleged that no-one in the Claimant knew or could have known that there was a dispute with the Respondent before reading the newspaper article on 11 March 2008 reporting President Saca\u2019s speech. The Respondent submits that, in fact, Mr Parada\u2019s testimony (and all that has been associated with it) would have been completely unnecessary if the Claimant had not raised this absurd allegation, or if the Claimant in September 2010 had simply responded to the Respondent\u2019s questions and admitted the true facts which it finally admitted much later in April 2011; namely: the Claimant's retention of international arbitration counsel with regard to the Respondent in October 2007 and such counsel's attendance with their client at a lunch for President Saca in November 2007, before the Claimant's change of nationality in December 2007.\n\n6.57.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimant maintained that there was no dispute with the Respondent before March 2008; that the Claimant asserted, \"prior to March 2008, Claimant had no reason to believe that this temporary impasse would not be resolved\"; and that the report of President Saca's speech in March 2008 \"was the first time that Claimant believed that its legal rights under Salvadoran and international law were being 'positively opposed' by El Salvador.\" As a result of these assertions, the Respondent included questions about the Claimant's counsel in its request for documents and information, explaining that because \"the August 17, 2010 letter denies that Pac Rim Cayman's change in nationality of December 2007 enabled the company to begin CAFTA arbitration about a dispute that already existed,\" the \"timing of the relationship between Pac Rim Cayman and its international arbitration counsel\" would be \"relevant and material\" to the Abuse of Process objection. The Respondent acknowledges, of course, that it knew that the Claimant's statements were false, but the Respondent wanted to do everything possible to get the Claimant itself to admit the true facts without the need for any testimony from Mr Parada.\n\n6.58.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant, however, rather than simply admitting at this time the facts that it later admitted, responded by mischaracterising those facts and arguing that the Respondent\u2019s questions were irrelevant: according to the Claimant, \"[t]he issue of when Claimant or any of its affiliates decided to hire lobbyists or lawyers or any other service providers to assist them with the issues they were facing in El Salvador (which, as of December 2007, principally involved the failure of Salvadoran regulators to rule on Claimant's application for a mining concession at the El Dorado site) has nothing to do with any question before the Tribunal\". In response, so the Respondent submits, it was required to reiterate its request, explaining again that the questions relating to the Claimant's counsel were directly relevant to establishing when the Parties\u2019 dispute existed and whether the Claimant's nationality was changed to gain access to CAFTA jurisdiction; specifically, so the Respondent wrote: \"it would be important to know if, for example, an attorney for Claimant met with a then-government official from El Salvador before Pac Rim Cayman's change in nationality and mentioned the possibility of initiating arbitration against El Salvador unless El Salvador granted the concession\".\n\n6.59.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant continued to refuse to provide the information, responding that such information was irrelevant; \"the possibility of any such meeting appears to be purely speculative on Respondent's part\"; and \"[t]his sort of \"fishing expedition\u2019 might be commonplace in U.S.-style litigation\", but it is \"not permitted under the norms of international arbitration generally or the standards of ICSID arbitration particularly.\"\n\n6.60.\n\nIn its Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal granted most of the Respondent\u2019s requests for information but not those relating to the Claimant's counsel, reserving this issue until after the first round of written pleadings. The Respondent renewed its requests for information after the Claimant filed its Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial and witness statements, insisting that, \"[i]t was only after President Saca's announcement of a de facto mining ban in March 2008 that we began to believe that a dispute with the Government was a real possibility.\"\n\n6.61.\n\nAs the Respondent then explained: \"Claimant's continued allegations in its CounterMemorial make the information and documents requested in El Salvador's requests numbers 10, 11, 12, and 13 even more relevant than before. As noted in El Salvador's original request, the timing of the relationship between [the Claimant] and its international arbitration counsel, as well as the identity of the client, are material for the Tribunal to make a decision regarding the reason why Pacific Rim decided to change the nationality of the Claimant from the Cayman Islands to the United States in December 2007. The issue is fundamental to the Tribunal's decision on the Objections to Jurisdiction because Claimant and its counsel have emphatically denied El Salvador's abuse of process objection and instead have accused El Salvador of fabricating the reasons for this objection.\" The Respondent ended its renewed request by noting that, if these questions remained unanswered, the Respondent would seek permission from the Tribunal to introduce evidence contradicting the assertions made by the Claimant; but the Claimant continued to refuse to answer the Respondent\u2019s questions and to insist that such questions were irrelevant.\n\n6.62.\n\nBy letter dated 22 February 2011, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to order the Respondent to produce any information it had relating to \"any Crowell & Moring lawyer having attended any meetings with Salvadoran officials prior to Pac Rim Cayman's domestication to Nevada in December 2007.\" The Respondent submits that it was only in response to that letter, given also the Claimant's refusal to answer the relevant questions, that Mr Parada was obliged to inform the Tribunal that he knew that the Claimant was not stating the true facts, explaining that he had been told directly by the Claimant's counsel (before the change of the Claimant\u2019s nationality in December 2007) that such counsel represented their client in a dispute with the Respondent and that their client was planning on commencing an arbitration under CAFTA, if this client did not receive its mining concession from the Respondent.\n\n6.63.\n\nIn response to Mr Parada's letter to the Tribunal, the Respondent submits that it was the Claimant which urged the Tribunal to order Mr Parada to submit a sworn witness statement: \"Not only does Claimant *not* oppose Mr Parada's request. To the contrary, Claimant submits that under the circumstances, the Tribunal should *order* Mr Parada to resubmit his 4 March 2011 letter as a sworn witness statement and to make himself available for cross-examination by Claimant's counsel during the hearing.\" Acceding to the Claimant's request, the Tribunal then ordered the Respondent to submit Mr Parada's sworn statement and required him to be available for cross-examination at the Hearing, as he was.\n\n6.64.\n\nThe Respondent contends that it was only after Mr Parada was ordered to submit a sworn statement and to be available for cross-examination that the Claimant finally admitted, ten days before the Hearing, that \"[a]n attorney-client relationship between Crowell & Moring and Pacific Rim Mining Corp. and its subsidiaries... commenced on or around [24 October 2007]\" and that Mr Ali and another of Claimant's counsel attended a lunch where President Saca was the keynote speaker on 28 November 2007. According to the Respondent, there is no excuse for the Claimant to have put the Respondent and the Tribunal through seven months of denials and evasions and then force Mr Parada to become a witness in this arbitration before giving these answers to the Respondent\u2019s questions, when truthful, timely answers could have avoided the entire situation.\n\n6.65.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Respondent submits that it is ironic for the Claimant to base its request that the Respondent should pay costs on the assertion that Mr Parada's testimony was somehow improper. The Respondent argues that there is no basis for this assertion: as an international arbitral tribunal, this Tribunal is not bound by the rules of any U.S. jurisdiction; there is no rule preventing the Tribunal from accepting Mr Parada\u2019s testimony; and there is no rule preventing the Claimant from submitting its own rebuttal testimony, which it chose not to do at the Hearing. According to ICSID Arbitration Rule 34: \"(t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value\"); and, thus, the Tribunal has full discretion to decide what evidence to admit and to determine the relevance and materiality of any proffered evidence.\n\n6.66.\n\nThe Respondent submits that even under the American Bar Association Model Rule (cited by the Claimant) as discouraging lawyers from representing parties in trials where the lawyer is likely to be a witness, it was acceptable and appropriate for Mr Parada to provide his witness statement in this case; and it would have been acceptable and appropriate for Mr Ali and Mr de Gramont to testify as factual witnesses at the Hearing if they believed that anything in Mr Parada's statement was inaccurate. The Respondent repeats that Mr Parada could not have anticipated that he would need to become a factual witness in this arbitration until the Claimant argued, falsely, that it could not have known that there was a dispute until after March 2008. As for Mr Ali and Mr de Gramont, if they did not believe that Mr Parada's testimony was accurate, the model rule would not apply to them because it would not have been in any way foreseeable that they would be necessary factual witnesses when they agreed to represent the Claimant as counsel; and, in addition, they could have testified under the \"substantial hardship exception\u2019 to protect their client's interests.\n\n6.67.\n\nIn fact, the Respondent submits that the Claimant never denied the truth of Mr Parada's account, even in correspondence after Mr Parada filed his witness statement with the Tribunal. In its letter of 14 March 2011, the Claimant requested documents relating to Mr Parada's statement, claiming that the documents provided with the original statement were \"highly selective\"; as the Respondent noted in its response to this letter: \"The most important aspect of Claimant's request is that Claimant has not contested the facts in Mr Parada's Witness Statement. Claimant should not be permitted to instead use innuendo to imply that the facts in Mr Parada's Witness Statement are not true. If Claimant and its counsel actually believe that the facts are not as Mr Parada asserts in his Witness Statement, they can submit witness statements from Mr Ali and Mr de Gramont to that effect. They should not be allowed to instead waste the Tribunal's time with a request for irrelevant information.\"\n\n6.68.\n\nThe Claimant responded on 23 March 2011, defending its requests for documents, but still not denying the facts stated in Mr Parada's written testimony; and the Respondent again highlighted the lack of denial in its next letter to the Tribunal: \"The most significant aspect of Mr Posner's letter [for the Claimant] is not what it says, but what it still fails to say. There is no mention in Mr Posner's letter that he has discussed Mr Parada's Statement with the two partners from Claimant's counsel that have direct knowledge of the conversations recounted by Mr Parada to ask them to confirm or deny the truth of his declaration [i.e. Mr Ali and Mr de Gramont].\" According to the Respondent, the Claimant did not deny the facts in Mr Parada's statement in the communications with the Tribunal regarding procedural issues leading up to the hearing originally scheduled to begin on 23 March 2011 or during the procedural meeting held by telephone conference-call preceding that intended hearing.\n\n6.69.\n\nThe Respondent states that it urged the Claimant directly to respond to Mr Parada's testimony in its letter of 22 April 2011: \" El Salvador also notes - again - that Claimant continues to insist on document production from Mr Parada, while failing to tell the Tribunal whether Mr de Gramont and Mr Ali confirm or deny that they were already working for [Pacific Rim] and preparing for this arbitration before [Pacific Rim] changed [the Claimant\u2019s] nationality to allow it to become the Claimant in this arbitration. Claimant's answer to this question could save the parties and the Tribunal considerable time and expense in disposing of this case.\" The Respondent submits that, after refusing to answer the Respondent\u2019 s questions for seven months, the Claimant finally admitted the truth of most of Mr Parada's testimony by its letter dated 22 April 2011; but that, even then, the Claimant persisted in having the Tribunal call Mr Parada as an oral witness at the Hearing and there conducted an intensive cross-examination aimed at impugning Mr Parada's credibility, without ever indicating that Mr Ali and Mr de Gramont denied any part of Mr Parada's factual testimony.\n\n6.70.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that, given multiple opportunities, Mr Ali and Mr de Gramont never denied the truth of any of Mr Parada's statements; that Mr Parada's early factual knowledge about the dispute with the Respondent and the potential arbitration could have only come from the Claimant's own counsel; that the Claimant's attacks on Mr Parada's credibility as a factual witness are baseless; and that all this can clearly not entitle the Claimant to costs based on Mr Parada's testimony but, rather, the reverse.\n\n6.71.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent submits that this arbitration concerning a pre-existing dispute between the Parties regarding claims arising from the failure to issue a concession that the Claimant did not have a right to receive should never have been initiated against the Respondent; and that, having been unfairly subjected to this abusive process by the Claimant and to the Claimant's abusive tactics in this arbitration, the Respondent is entitled to recover its costs from the Claimant.\n\n6.72.\n\nAs to the amount of such costs, the Respondent submits the following figures:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **The Respondent's Statement of Costs** |\n| Attorneys\u2019 fees | US$3,610,651.75 |\n| Other Expenses | UD$447,068.21 |\n| Amounts paid or due to ICSID | US$250,000.00 |\n| **TOTAL:** | US$4,307,719.96 |\n\n6.73.\n\nThe Respondent notes that its own claim for attorneys' fees for this arbitration total US$3,610,651.75 and that the Claimant's attorneys\u2019 fees total US$4,147,010.00 for the two rounds of objections: a significant difference of US$536,358.25.\n\n6.74.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, given that the Respondent had to carry the burden of proof for its two sets of objections, there is no reason that the Claimant's legal fees should be higher than the Respondent\u2019s legal fees. Nevertheless, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's higher legal fees are evidence that the amount of legal fees incurred by the Respondent is a reasonable amount for the Tribunal to include in its award as compensation for the Respondent\u2019s legal costs.\n\n***(05) The Claimant's Response***\n----------------------------------\n\n6.75.\n\nThe Claimant responds that the Respondent's claim for costs is remarkable in that nowhere does it identify a legal rule for the Tribunal to apply in deciding how to allocate the costs of this arbitration to date; that, rather than argue any relevant legal points of law, the Respondent merely repeats arguments underlying its jurisdictional objections and the baseless accusation that the Claimant has not acted \"honestly and in good faith\"; that if its objections are well-founded (which they are not), that it should then automatically be entitled to have the Claimant \"bear all the costs and expenses incurred by El Salvador in this arbitration.\" The Claimant argues that the Respondent cites no authority for this proposition, because there is none in CAFTA, the ICSID Convention or in any other source of law applicable to this international arbitration.\n\n6.76.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's repetition of its jurisdictional arguments contrasts adversely with the Claimant's costs submission, which articulates the relevant legal standard; explains why the application of that standard justifies an award of costs against the Respondent in this case; and then quantifies those costs. The Claimant notes that it has already addressed the Respondent's jurisdictional arguments in its written and oral submissions; and as the Respondent has identified no other basis for its costs submission, the Tribunal should decline the Respondent's request for an award of costs.\n\n***(06) The Tribunal's Analysis and Decisions***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n6.77.\n\nThe Tribunal decides to receive in full all the submissions on costs made by the Parties; and it rejects the application by the Respondent to exclude the Claimant\u2019s separate written submission on costs.\n\n6.78.\n\nAs regards the first phase of these arbitration proceedings resulting in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of 2 August 2010, the Tribunal sees at present no reason to depart from its original decision expressed in Paragraph 266(3) of that Decision; namely, that the Tribunal would reserve its powers to order legal and arbitration costs under CAFTA Article 10.20.6 relating to that first phase \"until the final stage of these arbitration proceedings.\" The Tribunal notes, of course, that the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA Claims cannot proceed beyond this Decision on Jurisdiction; but nonetheless the Tribunal thinks that it may be appropriate to weigh in the balance for the purpose of its discretion on such costs the final result of the Claimant\u2019s Non-CAFTA Claims, principally because both Claims relate to the same essential complaint (albeit advanced in different legal terms under separate instruments).\n\n6.79.\n\nAs regards this second phase of these arbitration proceedings resulting in this Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers that neither the Claimant nor the Respondent can be regarded as having either wholly succeeded or wholly lost their respective cases. Whilst the Claimant\u2019s CAFTA Claims can no longer proceed in this arbitration as a result of this Decision, the Claimant\u2019s Non-CAFTA Claims may now proceed to the merits of the Parties\u2019 dispute.\n\n6.80.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that, in the exercise of its discretion under ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(1), the eventual result of these Non-CAFTA Claims on the merits may provide a highly relevant factor to any decision as to the final allocation of legal and arbitration costs between the Parties. Indeed, the Parties\u2019 respective cases on costs, as summarised above, closely mirror their different submissions as to those eventual merits. Accordingly, as a matter of discretion, the Tribunal declines to make an order at this stage as regards the allocation of any legal or arbitration costs incurred during this second phase of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n6.81.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that its powers as to costs under the ICSID Arbitration Rules are limited to an order in an award; and that this Decision is not an \"award\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n6.82.\n\nIt remains nevertheless appropriate for the Tribunal to state at this stage certain conclusions regarding the Parties\u2019 respective arguments on costs. First, the Tribunal does not criticise the conduct of the Respondent or its Counsel (including Mr Parada) for submitting to the Tribunal factual evidence of certain events in November and December 2007 apparently disputed by the Claimant and then potentially relevant to the issues of jurisdiction. It would be possible here to say much more; but, given that this arbitration will continue further, the Tribunal considers it best to state this conclusion succinctly on what must now be regarded as a dead issue for the future of these arbitration proceedings. As regards the Claimant, the Tribunal similarly discounts the Respondent\u2019s criticism of its conduct during these arbitration proceedings. Again, the less here said, the better in what was inevitably an uncomfortable controversy.\n\n6.83.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal intends that its lengthy summary of the Parties\u2019 other arguments on costs, as set out above, will provide a written record which it will be unnecessary for the Parties to duplicate later in these arbitration proceedings. In the meantime, until an award or the final stage of these proceedings, the Tribunal reserves in full all its powers and jurisdiction in regards to legal and arbitration costs as regards both Parties\u2019 existing and future claims.\n\n***PART 7: THE OPERATIVE PART***\n--------------------------------\n\n7.1.\n\n**For the reasons and on the grounds set out above, the Tribunal finally decides as follows:**\n\n**(A) As to the Claimant's CAFTA Claims:**\n\n**(1) the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's jurisdictional objections based on the \"Abuse of Process\" issue;**\n\n**(2) the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's jurisdictional objections based on the \"Ratione Temporis\" issue;**\n\n**(3) the Tribunal accepts the Respondent's jurisdictional objections based on the \"Denial of Benefits\" issue; and**\n\n**(4) the Tribunal accordingly declares that the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"the Centre\") and this Tribunal have no** **jurisdiction or competence to decide such CAFTA Claims in these arbitration proceedings pursuant to CAFTA Articles 10.16, 10.17 and ICSID Article 25(1);**\n\n**(B) As to the Claimant's Claims under the Investment Law, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's jurisdictional objections and declares that the Centre and this Tribunal have jurisdiction and competence to decide such Claims in these arbitration proceedings pursuant to ICSID Article 25(1);**\n\n**(C)** **As to Costs, the Tribunal here makes no order as to any legal or arbitration costs, whilst specifically reserving in full its jurisdiction and powers as to all orders for costs at the final stage of these arbitration proceedings; and**\n\n**(D) As to all other matters, the Tribunal retains in full its jurisdiction and powers generally to decide such matters in these arbitration proceedings, whether by order, decision or award.**"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2016-10-14T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n***List of Selected Legal Materials***\n--------------------------------------\n\n***Treaties:***\n---------------\n\nThe Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement of 2004 (\"CAFTA\")\n\nThe ICSID Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes of 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\")\n\nThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 (\"Vienna Convention\")\n\n***Salvadoran Laws:***\n----------------------\n\nConstitution of the Republic of El Salvador (1983)\n\nInvestment Law, Legislative Decree No. 732, 14 October 1999\n\nMining Law, Legislative Decree No. 544, 14 December 1995, amended by Legislative Decree No. 475, 11 July 2001\n\nRegulations of the Mining Law and its Amendments, Legislative Decree No. 47, 20 June 2003\n\nCivil Code of El Salvador, Un-numbered Decree, published in the Official Gazette No. 85, Book 8, 14 April 1860, amended by Decree No. 512\n\n***Decisions, Awards and Judgments:***\n--------------------------------------\n\n*ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16), Award (2 October 2006)\n\n*Alan Craig v Ministry of Energy of Iran*, et al., Award No. 71-34 6-3, (2 September 1983)\n\n*Antoine Biloune, Marine Drive Complex Ltd. v Ghana Investments Centre, the Government of Ghana*, Award on Damages and Costs (30 June 1990)\n\n*Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. v Republic of Venezuela*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/05), Award (23 September 2003)\n\n*Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd*, [1978] 1 QB 479 *Bocardo SA v Star EnergyUK Onshore Ltd* [2011] 1 AC 380\n\n*Case Concerning The Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v Thailand)*, Merits, Judgment of 15 June 1962, 1962 ICJ Reports 101\n\n*Case Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v Spain)*, Judgment, Second Phase, 5 Feb. 1970, ICJ Reports 1970\n\n*Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed banka A.S. v Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Respondent's Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction (1 December 2000)\n\n*Chevron & Texaco v Ecuador*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award (1 December 2008)\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (17 July 2003)\n\n*ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V., ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, and Dissenting Opinion of G.

The Parties***\n--------------------\n\n1.1.\n\n***The Claimant:*** The named Claimant is Pac Rim Cayman LLC (also called \"Pac Rim Cayman\" or \"PRC\" and, occasionally, \"Pac Rim\"). It is a legal person organised under the laws of Nevada, USA, with its principal office at 3545 Airway Drive, Suite 105, Reno, Nevada 89511, USA. The Claimant was wholly owned by Pacific Rim Mining Corporation (also called \"Pacific Rim\" or \"PRMC\" and also, confusingly, \"Pac Rim\"). Pacific Rim is or was a legal person organised as a public company under the laws of Canada. At the beginning of these arbitration proceedings, the Claimant advanced several claims against the Respondent both on its own behalf and on behalf of its subsidiary companies, collectively described (below) as the \"Enterprises.\"\n\n1.2.\n\nFor ease of reference, save where the context requires otherwise, the Claimant and its parent company Pacific Rim are collectively described as \"Pac Rim.\"\n\n1.3.\n\n***The Claimant's \"Enterprises\"*** : The \"Enterprises\" are legal persons organised under the laws of the Respondent, namely: (i) Pacific Rim El Salvador, Sociedad An\u00f3nima de Capital Variable (also called \"PRES\"), with its principal office at 5 Avda. Norte, No. 16, Barrio San Antonio, Sensuntepeque, Caba\u00f1as, El Salvador; and (ii) Dorado Exploraciones, Sociedad An\u00f3nima de Capital Variable (also called \"DOREX\"), with its principal office at the same address. PRES claims to be the owner of certain rights within the mining areas known as \"El Dorado Norte\", \"El Dorado Sur\" and \"Santa Rita\" in El Salvador; and DOREX claims to be the owner of certain rights within the mining areas known as \"Zamora/Cerro Colorado\", \"Pueblos\", \"Guaco\" and \"Huacuco\" in El Salvador.\n\n1.4.\n\n***The Claimant's Legal Representatives:*** Prior to 2 March 2012, the Claimant had designated its legal representatives as Arif H. Ali, Alexandre de Gramont, R. Timothy McCrum and Theodore Posner Esqs, all of Crowell & Moring LLP, 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20004, USA. By letter dated 2 March 2012, the Claimant advised the Secretary of the Tribunal that Messrs. Ali, de Gramont and Posner had changed law firm, and it submitted a Power of Attorney providing that the legal representatives for the Claimant henceforth be designated as Arif H. Ali, Alexandre de Gramont and Theodore Posner, Esqs. of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 1300 Eye Street, N.W., Suite 900, Washington, D.C. 20005, USA; and R. Timothy McCrum, Ian A. Laird, Kassi D. Tallent, and Ashley R. Riveira of Crowell & Moring LLP, 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20004, USA. At the time of this Award, the Claimant's principal legal representatives as counsel were Mr McCrum, Mr Laird, Ms Riveira and Mr Ruttinger.\n\n1.5.\n\n***The Respondent*** : The Respondent is the Republic of El Salvador. Its executive branch includes the President of the Republic and two major ministries dealing with the present case: the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources, known as \"MARN\" (*Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales*); and the Ministry of the Economy, known as \"MINEC\" (*Ministerio de Econom\u00eda*). The latter ministry included the Bureau of Hydrocarbons and Mines, known as the \"Bureau of Mines\" or the \"Bureau\" (*Direcci\u00f3n General de Hidrocarburos y Minas*).\n\n1.6.\n\n***The Respondent's Legal Representatives*** : The Respondent's legal representatives are Mr Douglas Mel\u00e9ndez, Attorney General of El Salvador; and Mr Aquiles Parada, Deputy Attorney General, Fiscal\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica, Edificio Primavera, Urbanizac\u00edon Madreselva 3, Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n, La Libertad, El Salvador. Prior to 10 March 2012, the Respondent had also designated its legal representatives as Messrs Derek C. Smith, Luis Parada, Tom\u00e1s Sol\u00eds and Ms Erin Argueta, all of Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, 1101 New York Avenue, N.W., Suite 1100, Washington D.C. 20005, USA. By letter dated 10 May 2012, the Respondent submitted a Power of Attorney providing that Messrs Smith and Parada, and Ms Argueta had moved to the law firm of Foley Hoag LLP, 1875 K Street N.W. Suite 800, Washington, D.C. 20006, USA; but that they continued to represent the Respondent in this arbitration. At the time of this Award, the Respondent's principal legal representatives were Mr Parada, Mr Smith and Ms Argueta, Foley Hoag LLP, 1717 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006-5350.\n\n1.7.\n\nThis Award is the third major decision made by the Tribunal in these arbitration proceedings, following (i) the Tribunal's Decision of 2 August 2010 regarding the Respondent's Preliminary Objections; and (ii) the Tribunal's Decision of 1 June 2012 on Jurisdiction. Whilst this arbitration's procedure is summarised below, further reference should be made to these two earlier decisions for the full account of this arbitration's procedural history, for which purpose both are incorporated by reference into this Award.\n\n***B. The Arbitration Agreement***\n----------------------------------\n\n1.8.\n\nThis arbitration is taking place, as invoked by the Claimant, under the arbitration agreement provided by Article 15(a) of the Respondent's Investment Law.\n\n1.9.\n\nArticle 15(a) of the Investment Law provides (as translated by the Claimant from the original Spanish into English), in relevant part:\n\n*\"In the case of disputes arising among foreign investors and the State, regarding their investments in El Salvador, the investors may submit the controversy to: (a) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), in order to settle the dispute by... arbitration, in accordance with the Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Investors of Other States (ICSID Convention)...\"*\n\n1.10.\n\nThe original Spanish text of Article 15 of the Investment Law provides, more fully:\n\n\"*En caso que surgieren controversias \u00f3 diferencias entre los inversionistas nacionales o extranjeros y el Estado, referentes a inversiones de aquellos, efectuadas en El Salvador, las partes podr\u00e1n acudir a los tribunales de justicia competentes, de acuerdo a los procedimientos legales. En el caso de controversias surgidas entre inversionistas extranjeros y el Estado, referentes a inversiones de aquellos efectuadas en EI Salvador, los inversionistas podr\u00e1n remitir la controversia: (a) Al Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones (CIADI), con el objeto de resolver la controversia mediante conciliaci\u00f3n y arbitraje, de conformidad con el Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de otros Estados (Convenio del CIADI);*\n\n1.11.\n\nThe Claimant is and has been since 13 December 2007 a national of a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention, namely the United States of America. The Respondent is and has been at all material times a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.\n\n***C. The Arbitral Procedure***\n-------------------------------\n\n1.12.\n\nOn 30 April 2009, Pac Rim Cayman LLC as the Claimant submitted a Notice of Arbitration pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and Article 15(a) of El Salvador's Investment Law (the \"Notice\" or \"Request\").

As recorded in paragraph 2,108 of this Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal cited the Claimant's counsel verbatim, as follows: *let me be very clear: with respect to our claim for damages, we are only asking for damages as a result of the breach that we became aware of and that we only could have become aware of in - as of March 2008 at the earliest*....\"; and \"... *let me just emphasize in response to the Tribunal's question as to whether the measure at issue is the same for the CAFTA claims and the Investment Law claims, it is. In both cases the measure at issue is the de facto mining ban [of 10 March 2008]. Also, as I said earlier, in both cases, Claimant is alleging damages only from the period from March 2008forward and not from any earlier period.\"4* This date of 10 March 2008 as the earliest relevant \"measure\" for the Claimant's claims for damages against the Respondent under the Investment Law remains a significant factor material to the merits of such claims in this third phase of the arbitration, to which the Tribunal returns below.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, Part 2, page 35, citing the Jurisdiction Hearing Transcript, D3,719 & 729 (see also D3,701).\n\n1.41.\n\n***Merits*** : On 21 June 2012, the Tribunal held a procedural meeting with the Parties by telephone conference to fix a timetable for the third \"merits\" phase of this arbitration.\n\n1.42.\n\nOn 12 October 2012, the Claimant requested an extension of 6 months to file its Memorial on the Merits and Quantum.\n\n1.43.\n\nOn 12 November 2012, the Tribunal granted the Claimant's request for an extension of time to submit its memorial by 29 March 2013.\n\n1.44.\n\nOn 29 March 2013, the Claimant submitted its Memorial on the Merits and Quantum (the Claimant's \"Memorial\").\n\n1.45.\n\nOn 10 January 2014, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Quantum (the Respondent's \"Counter-Memorial\").\n\n1.46.\n\nOn 12 April 2014, the Claimant submitted its Reply on the Merits and Quantum (the Claimant's \"Reply\").\n\n1.47.\n\nOn 11 June 2014, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits (the Claimant's \"Rejoinder\").\n\n1.48.\n\nOn 25 July 2014, the Center for International Environmental Law (\"CIEL\") submitted an application as a non-disputing party pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).

Unlike the previous two hearings, the Parties did not agree to open the hearing to the public; and the Tribunal had no power or discretion to order otherwise under the Investment Law and the ICSID Convention.

The Tribunal reserved at that time its decision on the Respondent's application to this Award. Whilst the Tribunal has not seen the cable, the Tribunal has concluded that its content, as described by the Respondent, is not sufficiently relevant or material to the Tribunal's decisions in this Award, nor sufficiently relevant or material to any review of its earlier two Decisions. Accordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses this application by the Respondent.\n\n1.56.\n\nIn 2014-2015, these proceedings were significantly delayed as a result of certain health issues affecting one of its members (namely, the Presiding Arbitrator), for which that member here apologises to the Parties.\n\n***D.

Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n3.1.\n\nThe Parties' dispute as to the merits under the Investment Law of El Salvador is briefly summarised below, taken from the Parties' several written and oral submissions made in this third phase of the arbitration.\n\n3.2.\n\nThese summaries are necessarily incomplete and do little justice to the work and diligence of the Parties in what became from the outset a complicated, long and difficult case, as to both jurisdiction and merits. The fact that a particular submission or piece of evidence is not expressly described below (or addressed later in this Award) should not be taken as an indication that it has not been considered by the Tribunal in making its decisions in this Award. Moreover, the Tribunal, for the purpose of this Award (as will appear below), considers that the decisive issues have a narrower scope than the Parties' full dispute.\n\n3.3.\n\nThe Tribunal appends overleaf several maps of the El Dorado Project demonstrating the location of the exploration and concession areas in dispute between the Parties. The first shows El Dorado near Sensuntepeque [R-24]; the second shows the area of the El Dorado concession requested by the Claimant (by PRES) [R-29]; and the third shows the location of the Minita zones within that requested concession area, with surface infrastructures [R-51, including PRES' PFS of 21 January 2015, Figure 4.3, C-9, superimposed].\n\n***B. The Claimant's Case***\n----------------------------\n\n3.4.\n\nIn summary,10 pursuant to Article 15(a) of the Investment Law, the Claimant, on its own behalf and in respect of PRES and DOREX, advances claims for damages, interest and costs against the Republic of El Salvador as the Respondent.\n\nThis summary is largely taken from the Claimant's Memorial, Reply, Post-hearing brief and oral submissions at the hearing.\n\n3.5.\n\nThe Claimant is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Nevada, USA. PRES and DOREX are companies incorporated under the laws of El Salvador and are wholly owned and controlled by the Claimant. As alleged by the Claimant, PRES was the owner of rights in \"El Dorado Norte\", \"El Dorado Sur\" and \"Santa Rita\"; and DOREX was the owner of rights in \"Zamora/Cerro Colorado\", \"Pueblos\", \"Guaco\" and \"Huacuco\" (As already indicated, save where the context requires otherwise, the term \"Pac Rim\" is used to refer collectively to the Claimant, its subsidiaries and also, where appropriate, the Claimant's former parent company, Pacific Rim).\n\n3.6.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, this case is essentially very simple: El Salvador spent many years creating a legal framework designed to encourage the rule of law and to facilitate foreign investment in its mining industry; El Salvador's representatives directly induced and encouraged Pac Rim to invest millions of US dollars between 2002 and 2008 in exploration and mining development in El Salvador; as a result, the Claimant reasonably believed that its mineral rights would be honoured by the Respondent and that it would be allowed to exploit minerals in its designated sites for the benefit of both its shareholders and of El Salvador; but then, with the announcement of a *de facto* ban on metallic mining by the Respondent's President in March 2008, the Salvadoran Government illegitimately swept aside the legal and regulatory regime upon which the Claimant had relied, depriving it of the value of its significant investments in El Salvador.\n\n3.7.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, under the Mining Law of 1995 (as amended in 2001), the Respondent has consistently sought to attract mining investment generally and specifically to encourage the exploitation of the El Dorado Project located in Caba\u00f1as, one of the poorest regions in El Salvador. Pac Rim was precisely the kind of investor El Salvador was looking for: a foreign investor with the funding, mining industry know-how and mineral exploration expertise necessary to bring the El Dorado Project into production. The El Dorado Project was Pac Rim's principal project in El Salvador.\n\n3.8.\n\nThus, from the time of Pac Rim's investment in 2002 until March 2008, senior officers of the Respondent's Government, including President El\u00edas Antonio Saca and Vice-President Ana Vilma Escobar, welcomed Pac Rim with open arms. At that time, these senior officers of the Respondent consistently assured Pac Rim (including the Claimant) that the Government was supportive of its investment in the El Dorado Project and were enthusiastic about the economic benefits they knew would accrue to the Respondent from a profitable and environmentally sound mining operation. Pac Rim, for its part, was eager to set new standards in the Americas for environmental and socially sustainable mining. Thus, Pac Rim actively sought to integrate itself into the communities located near the El Dorado Project, hosting hundreds of informational meetings, arranging tours of its mining facilities and sponsoring educational programs, medical clinics and community sporting events. Pac Rim also sought tangibly to improve the standard of living of the local inhabitants in Caba\u00f1as by building roads, digging water supply wells and planting over 40,000 trees.\n\n3.9.\n\nThroughout this period, Pac Rim engaged in the costly exploration work for which its team of seasoned mining specialists was uniquely qualified. Pac Rim's extensive exploration and development work established that the El Dorado Project contains a significant amount of high-grade gold reserves (over 1.4 million ounces) and demonstrated that the Project was technically and economically feasible. Thus, in 2004, PRES applied to the Respondent for the environmental permit and mining exploitation concession necessary to begin mineral extraction at El Dorado. PRES's applications complied fully with both Salvadoran laws and also international and North American good practices for engineering design and environmental management.\n\n3.10.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, what followed was a bureaucratic morass at the Respondent's Ministry of Environment (MARN), which was charged with issuing all environmental permits in El Salvador. Over the following years, PRES's application for an environmental permit and later applications by DOREX in connection with its exploration licenses, languished due to persistent personnel changes within MARN, understaffing and the inexperience of its technical staff charged with evaluating applications for environmental permits. Although Pac Rim was anxious to obtain the necessary permits, Pac Rim also understood that El Dorado was the first major modern mining project in the country; and it was therefore willing to be patient as it worked with MARN in the procedures for its environmental permit at El Dorado.\n\n3.11.\n\nThroughout this time, Pac Rim maintained an active collaboration with the Respondent's Ministry of Economy (MINEC) and its Bureau. The Minister of Economy (Ms Yolanda de Gavidia) and the Respondent's Vice-President (Ms Escobar) assured Pac Rim that the Claimant's investment was fully supported and desired by the Respondent's executive branch and that the environmental permit and exploitation concession would be forthcoming from the Respondent in regard to El Dorado.\n\n3.12.\n\nIn June 2006, Mr Hugo Barrera, the Respondent's Minister of the Environment (MARN), unexpectedly announced his intention to use his ministry's authority as a means of impeding the development of the mining industry in El Salvador. Mr Barrera's conduct drew immediate criticism from higher authorities within the Respondent's executive branch, resulting in a public reversal of his position and in further administrative action on Pac Rim's pending environmental permit applications. In the meantime, Pac Rim expressed whole-hearted support for the legitimate desire of the Ministers of Environment and Economy (MARN and MINEC) to reform the existing Mining Law in order to increase royalties accruing to the Respondent and to supplement existing environmental protections for local communities.\n\n3.13.\n\nIn 2007, Pac Rim continued to work with the Ministry of Economy to advance reforms to the Mining Law, while maintaining constant contact with the Environment Ministry (MARN) in regard to its pending applications for environmental permits under the Mining Law. Unfortunately, however, these applications were again frozen after a new minister was appointed to MARN (Mr Carlos Guerrero) who instructed its officials not to take any action on applications relating to metallic mining. In April 2007, mining industry representatives were publicly notified by the Ministers of Environment and Economy (MARN and MINEC) that metallic mining would be put on hold until after completion of a \"strategic environmental assessment.\"\n\n3.14.\n\nPac Rim, as it contends, was unsure how the announcement of this strategic assessment would (or could) impact its pending applications regarding the El Dorado Project. Thus, Pac Rim continued to collaborate with the Respondent's executive branch regarding suggested reforms to the Mining Law; and these were introduced to the Respondent's Legislative Assembly in November 2007. Over the next several months, these proposed mining law reforms remained under consideration by the relevant committee within the Assembly; and Pac Rim was informed that it would be considered by the full Assembly in the near future. At this point, Pac Rim had sought advice from the highest levels of power in El Salvador (up to and including President Saca). Thus, Pac Rim understood that the amending bill was supported both by the Legislative Assembly, as well as the Respondent's President.\n\n3.15.\n\nThen, on 10 March 2008 (publicly reported on 11 March 2008), so the Claimant contends, the Respondent's President, President Saca, declared a *de facto* ban on all metallic mining projects in El Salvador, abruptly and effectively nullifying the valid legal and regulatory regime upon which the Claimant had relied in making its investment in El Salvador. According to the Claimant, this *de facto* ban eviscerated the Claimant's rights under the Investment Law, the Constitution of El Salvador and also general principles of international law. It also destroyed the Claimant's investment and nearly destroyed Pac Rim. According to the Claimant, there was no legal basis for the Respondent to deny Pac Rim's pending applications for the environmental permits and exploitation concession for the El Dorado Project that were necessary for the Claimant to realize the benefits of its investment in El Salvador. To the contrary, the Respondent's failure to issue these permits and the concession to Pac Rim can only be explained as an application of the unlawful, *de facto*, ban on metallic mining in El Salvador.\n\n3.16.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant contends that: (i) the Claimant (by PRES and DOREX) invested in El Salvador through its acquisition of property rights in relation to its El Dorado and other projects; (ii) the Claimant acted in reliance upon the Respondent's legal regime for its investment; (iii) the Claimant had a legitimate expectation of achieving a particular economic purpose with its investment: principally, that of developing active mineral exploitation at El Dorado; (iv) the Respondent's conduct at issue (that is, the implementation of the *de facto* ban by its executive branch from 10 March 2008 onwards) is a proven fact; (v) the *de facto* mining ban is wrongful; and (vi) the *de facto* ban breached the Respondent's obligations towards the Claimant under both the Investment Law and international law. The Claimant claims monetary damages of US$ 284 million.11\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 692|(1); as modified by Claimant's Reply, para. 458.\n\n***C. The Respondent's Case***\n------------------------------\n\n3.17.\n\nIn summary,12 according to the Respondent, this case is about a Canadian mining company that purchased exploration rights in El Salvador when time was running short to apply for a mining exploitation concession. The Canadian company then decided to make a big gamble and failed. Instead of accepting the consequences of its own decisions, the company, by the Claimant as its subsidiary, started this arbitration in order to force the Respondent to grant to the Claimant a gold mining concession at El Dorado to which it never had any legal right. The Claimant is now trying to convince this Tribunal to order the people of El Salvador to pay for the company's failed gamble and, in fact, to pay a windfall to the Claimant from the national treasury by awarding \"lost profits\" based on property rights which the Claimant never held (directly or indirectly).\n\nThis summary is largely taken from the Respondent's Counter-Memorial, Rejoinder, Post-hearing brief and its oral submissions at the hearing.\n\n3.18.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, when Pac Rim (by its Canadian parent) came to El Salvador in April 2002, it knew that the two exploration licenses held by its predecessors for the El Dorado Project (Dayton Mining and Kinross), granted in 1996, would soon reach the eight-year statutory limit and could not be extended beyond 1 January 2005 under Salvadoran law. This meant that Pac Rim had only two and a half years to conduct the exploration work necessary to prepare an application for a mining exploitation concession within that area. Pac Rim could have made the reasonable decision to concentrate its time, money and effort on completing all the work necessary to apply for an exploitation concession for a small and well-understood area within the vast area originally licensed for exploration. It could then have focused on the \"Minita\" deposit at El Dorado, the only deposit in the exploration areas for which Pac Rim was able to complete even a pre-feasibility study.\n\n3.19.\n\nInstead, so the Respondent alleges, Pac Rim made a conscious decision to embark upon a risky and highly speculative \"two-track strategy,\" engaging in new exploration activities in the expiring license areas as it attempted to prepare the required documentary materials for a concession application at El Dorado. Pac Rim sought to stake its claim to as much land as possible for future exploration; it wanted to continue exploring the expiring licensed exploration areas by including large unexplored areas in its requested concession; and it tried to acquire new exploration licenses to engage in exploration activities elsewhere, even as it struggled to meet the requirements for its application for the exploitation concession at El Dorado that should have been the sole object of its attention.\n\n3.20.\n\nAs a result of its own decision to stake out as much land as possible for future exploration, the Respondent contends that Pac Rim submitted in December 2004 an incomplete application for an unreasonably large concession area at El Dorado, failing to fulfil the minimum documentary requirements to have its application admitted for consideration under the Mining Law. In fact, because of its risky and speculative \"two-track strategy,\" Pac Rim would not have been able to meet the requirements even for a smaller concession, covering only the Minita deposit in a small part of El Dorado.\n\n3.21.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Pac Rim was never interested in a small concession area: it wanted \"everything.\" Pac Rim expected the Respondent to grant it rights and permits regardless of its companies' failure to comply with the Mining Law. It viewed Salvadoran law as a formality that could not stand in its way. Pac Rim also misunderstood the good will and good intentions of many Salvadoran governmental officials, at the Bureau and elsewhere, who went out of their way to help Pac Rim to complete its application for an exploitation concession at El Dorado. These officials allowed Pac Rim to submit an incomplete application for the concession on 22 December 2004 and to held the application without formal review for almost two years, so as to avoid triggering the Mining Law's mandatory time limits to correct deficiencies in that application. This allowed Pac Rim additional time to try to complete the feasibility study required under the Mining Law; but Pac Rim still failed to do so. These same officials also tried to accommodate Pac Rim with another requirement it could not meet under the Mining Law, namely the requirement to show land ownership or authorisation from the landowners for the requested concession area. The Ministry of Economy even attempted to have the Mining Law amended by the Legislative Assembly so that Pac Rim's application could comply with the requirements of the Mining Law, albeit with no success.\n\n3.22.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, instead of appreciating the extraordinary efforts that these Salvadoran officials made to help it, Pac Rim has acted as if these officials (with the Respondent's entire executive branch) had a legal obligation to do whatever was necessary, including changes in Salvadoran laws, so that Pac Rim could obtain the concession it wanted at El Dorado. These officials (not being legislators) were unable by themselves to change the relevant provisions of the laws as Pac Rim wanted. So, as the Respondent submits, Pac Rim then changed its strategy and itself drafted a proposed new law that reversed in its favour all the legal requirements which it could not meet under the Mining Law. Pac Rim hired lobbyists in El Salvador to gain legislative support for its proposed new law; and, from the USA, it put pressure on the Respondent to accommodate the company. Pac Rim also tried to enlist the assistance of President Saca for its proposed new law to be enacted by the Legislative Assembly. That proposed new law was never passed by the Assembly; and, as a result, Pac Rim's concession application remained subject to the existing requirements of the Mining Law in force at the time Pac Rim first came to El Salvador - legal requirements that Pac Rim could not and never did meet.\n\n3.23.\n\nAs submitted by the Respondent, what Pac Rim failed to understand was that it was always obligated to comply with the laws of El Salvador. Neither the Respondent nor any other sovereign State in the world has a legal obligation to change its laws simply to accommodate the demands of a foreign investor. As established in other ICSID arbitrations in which El Salvador has been a successful respondent, it is the foreign investor who has the legal obligation to make its investment in accordance with the laws of the host State. This self-evident legal principle is also recognized in the text of the Investment Law, which is the sole legal instrument under which this arbitration now proceeds in this arbitration's third phase.\n\n3.24.\n\nPac Rim comes to this Tribunal seeking an award of damages for almost US$ 300 million, as the alleged value of all its underground gold and silver deposits. Pac Rim claims this compensation based on a theory that it acquired property rights over unrecovered mineral deposits that are still underground, in expired exploration areas, even though Pac Rim never made an admissible or admitted application for a mining exploitation concession, much less awarded, to allow for their extraction under the Mining Law.\n\n3.25.\n\nLike the Claimant, albeit for different reasons, the Respondent submits that this case is simple: Pac Rim was not legally entitled to any mining exploitation concession and acquired no rights in the exploration licenses included in its claims for damages; the Respondent breached no legal duty toward Pac Rim under the Investment Law; and the Respondent is not liable for any alleged damages as a result of not granting any concession and of not granting any environmental or other permits to Pac Rim.\n\n3.26.\n\nUnder the Tribunal's earlier Decisions, the Respondent emphasises that this arbitration has only been allowed to proceed under the Investment Law. Having invoked jurisdiction under the Investment Law and seeking its protection, Pac Rim cannot escape the consequences of that choice. According to the Respondent, the most important of these consequences are: (i) the only claims that may be brought in this arbitration are claims regarding the rights and obligations included in the Investment Law; (ii) Salvadoran law is the applicable substantive law in this arbitration; (iii) the Investment Law places limitations on investments related to mining activities with which Pac Rim had to comply, including the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of El Salvador to decide disputes related to exploration licenses and exploitation concessions; and (iv) a three-year statute of limitations applies to the Claimant's claims related to the application for the El Dorado concession.\n\n3.27.\n\nAs a result of the applicable law and the evidence, so the Respondent concludes, all of Pac Rim's claims should be declared inadmissible or dismissed by the Tribunal on their merits.\n\n***D. The Amici Curiae***\n-------------------------\n\n3.28.\n\nAs indicated in Part I above, the Tribunal admitted the application of CIEL (with its coalition of six communites and other organisations) as a non-disputing party under ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2). In brief, CIEL (by its substantive written submissions dated 25 July 2014) primarily advanced a legal case that measures adopted by the Respondent regarding the Claimant's El Dorado Project (with other projects) were supported by the Respondent's international obligations on human rights and the protection of a healthy environment.\n\n3.29.\n\nCIEL's conclusions, submitted in the Spanish language, read as follows (pages 12-13 of its submission):\n\nEl derecho internacional contempor\u00e1neo consagra obligaciones de derechos humanos relativas a la protecci\u00f3n ambiental. Estas obligaciones protegen el derecho a vivir en un medio ambiente sano, el derecho a la salud y la vida digna, el derecho a la propiedad y las tierras, y el derecho al agua y a la alimentaci\u00f3n, entre otros derechos humanos. Estos derechos son fundamentales para la consecuci\u00f3n del desarrollo sostenible del territorio y la protecci\u00f3n de las comunidades locales que en \u00e9l habitan.\n\nLa implementaci\u00f3n por parte del Estado de un marco normativo dise\u00f1ado para la protecci\u00f3n de estos derechos frente a los riesgos generados por industrias extractivas se apoya en las obligaciones internacionales de derechos humanos. Especialmente en un pa\u00eds como El Salvador, que sufre de alta densidad poblacional y escasez de recursos h\u00eddricos, la aplicaci\u00f3n de los requisitos legales y los procesos administrativos son herramientas indispensables para que el Estado pueda salvaguardar los derechos amenazados por las industrias extractivas.\n\n\u2026\n\nEnglish translation (by the Tribunal): Contemporary international law enshrines human rights obligations relating to environmental protection. These obligations protect the right to live in a healthy environment, the right to health and a life of dignity, the right to property and lands, and the right to water and food, among other human rights. These rights are fundamental to the attainment of the sustainable development of the territory and to the protection of local communities that reside therein.\n\nThe implementation by the State of a normative framework designed to protect these rights against the risks posed by extractive industries is supported by international human rights obligations. Especially in a country like El Salvador, who suffers from high population density and scarcity of water resources, the application of legal requirements and administrative processes are indispensable tools for the State to safeguard the rights threatened by extractive industries.\n\n3.30.\n\nFor two reasons, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary here to summarise or address CIEL's case more fully. First, in the absence of the Parties' joint consent, CIEL was not made privy to the mass of factual evidence adduced in this arbitration's third phase, including the hearing (which was not held in public, as explained in Part I above). Second, the Tribunal's decisions in this Award do not require the Tribunal specifically to consider the legal case advanced by CIEL: and, in the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to do so.\n\n***E. The Parties' Respective Prayers for Relief***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n3.31.\n\n*The Claimant's Prayer for Relief* : The Claimant formally requests the Tribunal, as pleaded in paragraph 692 of its Memorial, to:\n\n(1) Declare that the Respondent has breached the terms of the Foreign Investment Law, the Constitution, and general principles of international law;\n\n(2) Award the Claimant monetary damages of not less than US$ 314 million (Three hundred and fourteen million U.S. dollars) in compensation for all of its losses sustained as a result of the Respondent's illegal action and inaction and thus being deprived of its rights under the Foreign Investment Law, the Constitution and general principles of international law;\n\n(3) Award all costs (including, without limitation, attorneys' and all other professional fees) associated with any and all proceedings undertaken in connection with this arbitration, including all such costs undertaken to investigate this matter and prepare this and earlier submissions, and all such costs expended by Claimant in attempting to resolve this matter amicably with Respondent; plus further costs and expenses as the Tribunal may find are owed under applicable law;\n\n(4) Award pre-and post-judgment interest at a rate to be fixed by the Tribunal; and\n\n(5) Grant such other relief as counsel may advise or the Tribunal may deem appropriate.\n\n3.32.\n\n*Respondent's Prayer for Relief* : The Respondent formally requests the Tribunal, as pleaded in paragraph 471 of its Counter-Memorial, to:\n\n(1) Issue an Award stating that it lacks jurisdiction under the Investment Law of El Salvador and dismissing all claims for lack of jurisdiction;\n\n(2) Should the Tribunal find that it has jurisdiction over any claim, for the reasons stated above, issue an Award dismissing all claims for lack of factual and legal merit;\n\n(3) Order Claimant to pay all costs and expenses of all phases of this arbitration, and reimburse El Salvador for its legal and expert fees and costs for all phases of this arbitration, plus interest from the time of the Award until payment is made, in an amount and at a rate to be established at the appropriate time; and\n\n(4) Grant El Salvador any other remedy that the Tribunal considers appropriate.\n\n**PART IV: THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES**\n---------------------------------\n\n***A. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n4.1.\n\nThe Tribunal identifies, for the purpose of this Award, the following principal issues derived from the Parties' written and oral submissions made during this third phase of the arbitration.\n\n***B.

Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n5.1.\n\nThe Tribunal here turns to the Respondent's additional objections to its jurisdiction under Article 15(a) of the Investment Law and the ICSID Convention. These comprise the first of its principal issues listed in Part IV above. The Tribunal first briefly summarises the Parties' submissions on these objections; and it then provides its analysis and decisions.\n\n***B. The Parties' Submissions***\n---------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Admissible Scope of Claims in Light of the Applicable Law(s)*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.2.\n\n*The Respondent's Case:* In summary, the Respondent submits that exclusively Salvadoran law applies to this arbitration, and that therefore certain claims of the Claimant exceed the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. First, the Respondent argues that Salvadoran law is the only law that applies because it would breach the principle of equality of Article 5 of the Investment Law if foreign investors could invoke broader interpretations and causes of action in international arbitration while domestic investors could only rely on Salvadoran law.13\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 283-286.\n\n5.3.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that consistency demands that Salvadoran law be the applicable law, as this would be the applicable law if a dispute within the scope of Article 15 of the Investment Law were submitted to a Salvadoran court. According to the Respondent, consistency requires that the same law must be applied if the investor resorts to international arbitration, such as this arbitration under the ICSID Convention.14\n\n*Ibid.* para. 288.\n\n5.4.\n\nThird, the Respondent submits that all investments located in El Salvador are subject to its laws and that therefore all investors agree that Salvadoran law applies to their investments and rights under the Investment Law.15 It maintains that the Claimant, by invoking jurisdiction under the Investment Law, agreed to the application of Salvadoran law within the meaning and scope of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.16\n\n*Ibid.* paras. 289-291 (invoking Article 16 of the Civil Code).\n\n*Ibid.* para. 279.\n\n5.5.\n\nFourth, the Respondent submits that all investments related to mining rights in the subsoil are subject to Salvadoran law by virtue of Article 7(b) of the Investment Law, read together with Article 7 of the Mining Law, notwithstanding Article 15 of the Investment Law.17\n\n*Ibid.* paras. 292-293.\n\n5.6.\n\nConsidering that Salvadoran law applies exclusively, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's claims based on general principles of international law must be rejected by the Tribunal. It argues that such claims transgress the rights and protections under the Investment Law and fall beyond the scope of Article 15.18 It further maintains that this limitation of the Investment Law has been upheld by the tribunal in *Inceysa v El Salvador*19 and similarly applies in this arbitration.20\n\n*Ibid.* paras. 266-267, 270-271.\n\n*Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award (2 August 2006) [hereinafter *Inceysa v El Salvador* ].\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 272-273.\n\n5.7.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's request for the Tribunal to determine that the Respondent has breached its Constitution would exceed the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the Investment Law. The Respondent contends that the Investment Law does not grant an arbitral tribunal the authority to decide upon the constitutionality of actions of the Salvadoran Government, this being reserved only to the Salvadoran Supreme Court.21\n\n*Ibid.* para. 278 (invoking Article 174 of the Salvadoran Constitution).\n\n5.8.\n\n*The Claimant's Response* : The Claimant submits that the Parties have not agreed to the application of any particular law and that Article 15 of the Investment Law does not contain any provision on applicable law.22 Absent an agreement on the applicable law, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal should proceed under the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention by applying the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute \"and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"23 The Claimant therefore maintains that relevant domestic and international laws may both be applied and that international law prevails over any domestic law inconsistent with it.24\n\nMemorial, para. 404.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.* para. 405.\n\n5.9.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant submits that the provisions of the Investment Law on the treatment of investors and their property \"are specifically intended to be consistent with international law.\"25 The Claimant submits that the Statement of Purpose of the Investment Law clarifies that this Salvadoran law is intended to reflect best practices in international investment law and should be interpreted in the light of such practices, including the principle of fair and equitable treatment and the protection of foreign investors' legitimate expectations based on the existing legal framework (the so-called \"FET standard\").26\n\n*Ibid.* para. 407.\n\n*Ibid.* para. 411.\n\n5.10.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that, alongside relevant international law and practice, the Constitution of El Salvador is \"of fundamental importance in construing and applying the protections and guarantees provided to foreign investors under Salvadoran law, and particularly under the Investment Law.\"27 It argues that the Investment Law should be interpreted in accordance with certain principles (legality, non-arbitrariness, proportionality, economic freedom, protection of property right, due process, right to a response) established in the Salvadoran Constitution and also recognized in international investment law.28\n\n*Ibid.* para. 413.\n\n*Ibid.* para. 415.\n\n*(ii) The Exclusive Jurisdiction of Salvadoran Courts under the Mining Law*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.11.\n\n*The Respondent's Case* : The Respondent maintains that Article 15 of the Investment Law is limited by Article 7(b), subjecting investments related to the exploitation of the subsoil to the Constitution and applicable secondary laws.29 According to the Respondent, if a dispute arises under the Investment Law in relation to mining exploration licenses or exploitation concessions, such dispute is referred by Article 7(b) of this Law and Article 7 of the Mining Law to the exclusive jurisdiction of Salvadoran courts. The Respondent submits that this limitation overrides the general stipulation in Article 15 of the Investment Law and that the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims.30\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 292-301\n\n*Ibid.* paras. 295, 301 & 425-433; Zamora ER 1, paras. 70-82.\n\n5.12.\n\n*The Claimant's Response* : The Claimant counters that this objection mistakenly asserts that it is raising claims for breach of a mining concession contract, or to obtain a license or concession or other form of administrative relief.31 To the contrary, the Claimant maintains that it is claiming damages for the wrongful treatment of its investments in El Salvador, such treatment involving violations of the Respondent's obligations towards foreign investors, rather than entitlements under the Mining Law.32\n\nReply, para. 439.\n\n*Ibid.* para. 440.\n\n5.13.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent has consented to submit to arbitration all disputes that may arise between investors and the State regarding investments in El Salvador under Article 15 of the Investment Law.33 The Claimant maintains that the Respondent's consent to arbitrate these disputes under the ICSID Convention amounts to an international obligation, which the Respondent cannot revoke by relying upon inconsistent provisions of its own domestic law.34\n\n*Ibid.* para. 441.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*(iii) The Applicability of a Three-Year Statute of Limitations to the El Dorado Claims*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.14.\n\n*The Respondent's Case* : The Respondent submits that the timing of the Claimant's claims involving the application for an exploitation concession at El Dorado exceeds the applicable three-year time limit under the Salvadoran Civil Code.35 The Respondent contends that this three-year period commenced at the moment upon which the alleged wrongful act occurred;36 and that this time limit cannot be evaded by bringing the claims to an ICSID tribunal.37\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 434-440 (w. ref. to Art. 2083 Civil Code); Rejoinder, paras. 437-442.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 434-435, w. ref. to Art. 2253 Civil Code.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 438-440 (with ref. to the principle of equality under Article 5 of the Investment Law).\n\n5.15.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the act that allegedly harmed the Claimant - the failure to decide on the application within the time limit established by law - occurred in or about December 2004. In its submission, given that the Claimant had a claim regarding its request for an exploitation concession for the El Dorado Project in December 2004, the three-year time limit expired in or about December 2007. Accordingly, the Respondent argues that by April 2009, when this arbitration was commenced by the Claimant, its claims in relation to the El Dorado Project were clearly time-barred under Salvadoran law.38\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 439-440; Rejoinder, paras. 440-442; Tr. D7.2024.\n\n5.16.\n\n*The Claimant's Response:* The Claimant denies that its claims are time-barred. It submits that the Respondent's objection to that effect rests on the mistaken assumption that its claims are based upon the Bureau's non-issuance of the exploitation concession within the time limit under the Mining Law. The Claimant contends that its claims are not based on the Bureau's failure to meet such deadline, but rather upon President Saca's *de facto* mining ban of 10 March 2008 and his subsequent refusal to allow the Respondent's relevant governmental agencies to permit mining projects in El Salvador.39 Moreover, the Claimant maintains that the environmental permit (necessary for PRES' application for a concession) had not been denied by the Respondent: the Ministry of Environment (MARN) was still corresponding with PRES in December 2008 and had informed it that, once additional documents were presented by PRES, its application for the environmental permit could be resolved.40\n\nReply, paras. 436-437.\n\n*Ibid*. paras. 436-437.\n\n5.17.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant maintains that domestic statutes of limitations do not apply to claims raised before international tribunals, including ICSID tribunals.41 It submits that this arbitration remains international in character, even though its jurisdiction derives from the Investment Law; and that this Law does not require the Tribunal to apply only domestic law rules on the interpretation of the Respondent's consent to ICSID jurisdiction.42\n\n*Ibid*. para. 438.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*(iv) The Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on the Abuse of Process Objection*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.18.\n\n*The Respondent's Case:* The Respondent also requests the Tribunal to reconsider its decision on the abuse of process objection made by the Respondent regarding Pac Rim's nationality change in December 2007 (namely the Tribunal's Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections of 1 June 2012). The Respondent maintains that the Claimant \"made a material misrepresentation to the Tribunal\"43 in having stated at the jurisdiction hearing that, until March 2008, the Claimant had not been aware that a dispute with the Respondent existed or was foreseeable. Yet, the Claimant now admits having been aware of a moratorium imposed by the Respondent in May 2007.44 The Respondent submits that the Tribunal relied upon the Claimant's misrepresentation in its Decision,45 and that the new admission from the Claimant now requires the Tribunal to reconsider the Respondent's objection as to abuse of process.46 The Respondent maintains that this part of the Tribunal's Decision is not *res judicata* until it is incorporated in an Award and that the Tribunal \"is not only empowered to reopen its prior decision on jurisdiction, but is also required to do so in the interest of justice.\".47\n\nTr. D7.2057; cf. Respondent's Post hearing brief, para. 13.\n\nTr. D7.2058-2059; (ref. to Memorial, paras. 298, 300); Respondent's Post hearing brief, para. 13.\n\nTr. D7.2058 (ref. to Jurisdictional Decision of 1 June 2012, para. 2,109).\n\nTr. D7.2059-2060; Respondent's Post hearing brief, para. 13.\n\nRespondent's Post hearing brief, para. 15.\n\n5.19.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that such reconsideration would affect the Tribunal's decision on the objection regarding the piercing of Pac Rim's corporate veil.48 It maintains that the Tribunal took note of the submissions on this point; but failed to address them,49 and requests the Tribunal to take into account that the Claimant was aware of a moratorium in May 2007 in order to \"revisit its Decision on Jurisdiction regarding Abuse of Process and how that is linked to the piercing of the corporate veil.\"50\n\nTr. D7.2061-2064.\n\n*Ibid*. 2064.\n\n*Ibid*. 2064-2065.\n\n5.20.\n\n*The Claimant's Response:* The Tribunal observes that the Claimant has not directly addressed the Respondent's request for reconsideration. However, the Tribunal notes the relevance of the Claimant's submissions on *res judicata*51 and the earlier submissions on abuse of process and the piercing of the corporate veil.52\n\nSee paras. 5.23-5.24.\n\nRejoinder Jurisdiction, paras. 46-127, 336-356; Claimant's Post-Hearing Submission on Jurisdiction, paras. 63-90 & 102-104.\n\n*(v) The* Res Judicata *Effect of the Decision on Jurisdiction*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.21.\n\n*The Respondent's Case* : Aside from its request for reconsideration, the Respondent maintains that it does not request the Tribunal to amend its earlier decision on jurisdiction and that *res judicata* considerations therefore do not apply. It contends that it is requesting the Tribunal to issue a new decision based on new submissions, rather than to revise what it has decided previously.53\n\nTr. D7.2054-2055.\n\n5.22.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the principle of *res judicata* would not apply at this stage, since a decision on jurisdiction by an ICSID tribunal is not final until it is incorporated in the award.54\n\n*Ibid*. 2060; Respondent's Post hearing brief, para. 15.\n\n5.23.\n\n*The Claimant's Response:* The Claimant submits that the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction is *res judicata* and should lead the Tribunal to refuse to consider the Respondent's additional jurisdictional objections.55 The Claimant also suggests that the present case meets the criteria for the application of *res judicata,* as this arbitration: (i) involves the same parties; (ii) has the same relief sought; and (iii) concerns causes of action involving the same questions of fact.56\n\n*Ibid*. 1887 & 1888; Claimant's Post hearing brief, para. 47.\n\nTr. D7.1894-1895.\n\n5.24.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant submits that the need for efficiency, finality and the avoidance of parallel proceedings support the view that *res judicata* applies to this arbitration.57 It also maintains that the structure of the ICSID Convention and 'equality of arms' considerations would be consistent with upholding the finality of the Tribunal's previous Decision.58\n\n*Ibid*. 1901.\n\n*Ibid*. 1901; Claimant's Post hearing brief, para. 47.\n\n*(vi) The Admissibility of the Additional Objections under the ICSID Arbitration Rules*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.25.\n\n*The Respondent's Case:* The Respondent submits that it raised its additional objections within the time limits set by ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1). It maintains that the objections are new in that: (i) they concern the scope of consent rather than its existence; (ii) they were raised as early as possible; and (iii) they were not filed after the expiration of the deadline for the filing of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial.59 It argues that since its objections are timely, the Tribunal is required to consider them before it can decide on the merits of the Parties' cases.60\n\nRespondent's Post hearing brief, para. 6.\n\nTr. D7.2053-2054 (w. ref. to Art. 41(2) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n5.26.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) establishes the deadline of the counter-memorial as the time limit for a respondent's jurisdictional objections, and that the objections raised in the Respondent's Counter-Memorial meet this time limit.61 It submits that previous ICSID decisions support this interpretation in deciding that: (i) the deadline is met when objections are filed with the counter-memorial; (ii) objections to jurisdiction are examined even if considered untimely; and (iii) respondents are allowed to file two sets of objections to jurisdiction (without considering that the right to make such further objections had been waived).62\n\nTr. D7.2045.\n\n*Ibid.* 2051-2052; Respondent's Post hearing brief, paras. 7-8.\n\n5.27.\n\nAs to the requirement that objections should be raised as early as possible, the Respondent explains that it had only identified the additional objections when the Claimant contended in its Memorial (on the merits) that there was no agreement on the applicable law.63 The Respondent submits that, since its earlier objections had aimed at denying consent rather than determining the scope of such consent in the light of the applicable law, there had been no reason for it to have identified its objections relating to the scope of consent under Article 15 of the Investment Law prior to the filing of the Claimant's Memorial.64\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 441; Tr. D7.2044-2047; Respondent's Post hearing brief, para. 6.\n\nTr. D7.2046-2047; Respondent's Post hearing brief, para. 6.\n\n5.28.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent maintains that when it raised objections to jurisdiction in 2010, which the Tribunal decided with its Decision on Jurisdiction of 1 June 2012, it reserved the right to raise additional objections.65 It maintains that the Claimant did not object to this reservation of rights. The Claimant therefore should be considered to have waived any right to object now to such objections.66\n\nCounter-Memorial Merits, para. 441; Tr. D1,259.\n\nTr. D7.2046; Respondent's Post hearing brief, para. 6.\n\n5.29.\n\n*The Claimant's Response:* The Claimant submits that, under the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Respondent is now precluded from raising the additional objections.67 It maintains that the governing principle in ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) is that such objections shall be made by a respondent as early as possible.68 As to the stipulation that they shall be filed no later than the expiration of the time limit for the filing of the respondent's countermemorial, the Claimant submits that this is not an exception to the requirement to submit them \"as early as possible\".69 Moreover, the Claimant maintains that the Respondent's additional jurisdictional objections are not new but merely repetitions of earlier ones, or objections that could have been raised earlier; and that this factor \"eliminates the Tribunal's limited authority to address new matters under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41.\"70\n\nTr. D7.1888-1892, & 1903-1910.\n\n*Ibid.* 1903.\n\n*Ibid.* 1903.\n\nClaimant's Post hearing brief, para. 47 (n. 36).\n\n5.30.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that jurisdictional objections have already been dealt with in this arbitration's jurisdiction phase, with the Parties' agreement to address matters of jurisdiction prior to the merits. It contends that the procedure set out in ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3) has already been completed, resulting in the objections being dealt with in full conformity with Rule 41(1) while the proceedings on the merits were suspended.71\n\nTr. D7.1904-1906; Claimant's Post hearing brief, para. 47. (ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3) provides: \"Any step taken after expiration of the applicable time limit shall be disregarded unless the Tribunal, in special circumstances and after giving the other party an opportunity of stating its views, decides otherwise.\"\n\n5.31.\n\nThe Claimant also maintains that ICSID Arbitration Rule 26 requires the Tribunal to disregard the Respondent's additional jurisdictional objections. It submits that this would be mandatory, unless there are special circumstances, of which there are none in this case.72\n\nTr. D7.1906-1907; Claimant's Post hearing brief, para. 47.\n\n5.32.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant interprets ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 as support for the proposition that if the Respondent believed that its additional objections were critical, it should have raised them earlier; and not nearly three years after the end of this arbitration's jurisdictional phase. It maintains that the Respondent's failure to have done so should be seen as a waiver of any right the Respondent might have had to raise further additional jurisdictional objections.73\n\nTr. D7.1907-1908: Claimant's Post hearing brief, para. 47. (ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 provides\" \"A party which knows or should have known that a provision of... these Rules... has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed - subject to Article 45 of the Convention - to have waived its right to object.\" Article 45 of the ICSID Convention is not here relevant).\n\n***C. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Admissibility of the Additional Jurisdictional Objections*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.33.\n\n*(i) The Competence of the Tribunal:* International tribunals, including this Tribunal, possess full and inherent authority to determine their own competence. As confirmed by Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal \"shall be the judge of its own competence.\" In other words, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to examine its own jurisdiction, i.e. \"Kompetenz-Kompetenz\", subject to Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention. Faced now with additional objections presented long after its Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections (which completed the second jurisdictional phase of this arbitration on 1 June 2012), this Tribunal must first establish whether it can entertain any new objections to its jurisdiction despite the advanced stage of this arbitration.\n\n5.34.\n\nArticle 41(2) of the ICSID Convention stipulates that any jurisdictional objection by a party to the dispute \"shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\" This provision specifies that the Tribunal shall make such determination, without restricting its general competence to decide on any objections subsequently raised. In this respect, under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2), this Tribunal has the duty, right and competence to satisfy itself that all jurisdictional requirements are fulfilled, regardless of the particular stage of the arbitration.\n\n5.35.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides upon its competence to entertain the Respondent's additional objections to its jurisdiction notwithstanding its Decision on Jurisdiction of 1 June 2012. In the exercise of this competence, it next determines whether the Respondent's additional objections are admissible.\n\n5.36.\n\n*(ii) The Effect of the Tribunal's Jurisdiction Decision on The Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections* : Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.\" In accordance with Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, an award must deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal. Since decisions affirming jurisdiction are limited to the settlement of jurisdictional questions prior to issues as to the merits, they do not have the status of an award under the ICSID Convention until their incorporation into the award that addresses all questions and thus decides the parties' dispute.74 In an ICSID arbitration, there can only be one award. Article 51 on revision and Article 53(1) on annulment of the ICSID Convention therefore do not apply to preliminary decisions affirming jurisdiction until their incorporation in the later award. This is only different when an ICSID tribunal denies all jurisdiction, since such a decision does bring the arbitration to an end and must therefore take the form of an award in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(6).75\n\nCf. Art. 48(3) ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i); *Electrabel S.A. v Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB 07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability (30 November 2012), para. 10.1 [hereinafter: *Electrabel v Hungary* ]; C.H. Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edition, Cambridge Univ. Press, 2009) 535-536, 812-813 & 1114; E. Gaillard and J. Savage (eds.), *Fouchard, Gaillard, Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration* (Kluwer Law Intl. 1999) 739-740.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(6) provides: \"If the Tribunal decides that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or not within its own competence, or that all claims are manifestly without legal merit, it shall render an award to that effect.\"\n\n5.37.\n\nThese considerations need not preclude an ICSID tribunal from determining that its earlier decision on jurisdiction should, by analogy with Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention or otherwise, be considered final at a later stage of the arbitration. It would be detrimental to the effectiveness of ICSID arbitration and to the proper administration of ICSID arbitrations if significant decisions could be subject to change at any time prior to the award, upon the request of an aggrieved party. With this in mind, the question arises whether the Tribunal's previous jurisdictional decision, by which it affirmed its jurisdiction under the Investment Law (but not CAFTA), does constitute a final determination on the matter of its jurisdiction under Article 15(a) of the Investment Law and the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.38.\n\nA positive view to this question was expressed by the ICSID tribunal in *Electrabel* in relation to its earlier decision on jurisdiction, applicable law and liability: \"Although necessarily described as a 'Decision' and not an 'Award' under the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules, the several decisions and reasons contained in this Decision are intended by the Tribunal to be final and not to be revisited by the Parties or the Tribunal in any later phase of these arbitration proceedings.\"76 The Tribunal is also aware of the debate generated by the *ConocoPhilips* procedural decision and the dissent concerning its *res judicata* effect77, and that other ICSID and other tribunals faced with additional objections to their jurisdiction have examined these later objections without considering that their earlier decisions had *res judicata* or final effect.78 The latter is particularly the case where a party is guilty of material fraud, perjury or other improper means used to procure the impugned earlier decision from an international tribunal.79\n\n*Electrabel v Hungary*, para. 10.1.\n\n*ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V., ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, and Dissenting Opinion of G. Abi-Saab (10 March 2014).\n\nSee *Helnan International Hotels A/S v Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Award (3 July 2008); *Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed banka A.S. v Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Respondent's Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction (1 December 2000).\n\nFor example, see *The Sabotage Cases, Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, Agency of Canadian Car and Foundry Company, Limited, and Various Underwriters (USA) v. Germany,* Decision, 15 December 1933, VII RIAA, p. 160; and *Antoine Biloune, Marine Drive Complex Ltd. v Ghana Investments Centre, the Government of Ghana*, Award on Damages and Costs, 30 June 1990, paras. 33-34 (following an earlier interim award on jurisdiction and liability).\n\n5.39.\n\nHowever, this Tribunal prefers in the present case not to invoke any principle of *res judicata* or finality, by analogy with Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention or otherwise. In its view, the question can here be decided more easily, as a practical matter, by direct reference to other provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n5.40.\n\n*(iii) The Admissibility under the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules:* The Respondent first raised its \"new\" additional objections in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits of 10 January 2014. This occurred more than one-and-a-half years after the Tribunal's Jurisdictional Decision of 1 June 2012 that followed its order of 1 September 2010 to suspend the proceedings on the merits in order to deal separately with questions of jurisdiction.80 The Tribunal also notes that these additional objections were raised more than three-and-a-half years after the Respondent submitted its objections to jurisdiction under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) on 3 August 2010.\n\nLetter to the Parties on behalf of the President of the Tribunal dated 1 September 2010, point (1).\n\n5.41.\n\nJurisdictional objections are preliminary in nature and, as a general principle, must be raised as early as possible. ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) provides that: \"Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made *as early as possible*. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General *no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial*, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder\u2014 *unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.*\" (Emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n5.42.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the ordinary meaning of this provision establishes as the primary rule that jurisdictional objections must be made as early as possible. This rule is subject to the further condition that any such objection may not exceed the time limit for the counter-memorial. The imposition of this time limit is an additional condition, not an alternative requirement. In other words, the indicated deadline does not negate the primary obligation to raise jurisdictional objections as early as possible. The exception to the time limit for objections based on facts that were unknown at that time further confirms that the governing condition remains that they should be raised \"as early as possible.\"\n\n5.43.\n\nThis interpretation is consistent with the approaches taken by other ICSID tribunals. Faced with objections to jurisdiction raised on the last day of the time limit fixed for the countermemorial, the tribunal in *Desert Line v Yemen* observed that: \"The fact that objections shall be filed with ICSID 'no later' than the deadline for the Counter-Memorial does not mean that the Respondent was not bound to raise them before that date, if such objections were or ought to have been already manifest, in view of the 'as early as possible' requirement...\".81 Similarly, the tribunal in *Urbaser v Argentina* characterised the requirement to raise the objections as early as possible as the \"primary rule\", and the condition that they shall be raised no later than the time limit for the counter-memorial as \"the secondary rule.\"82\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v Republic of Yemen*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award (6 February 2008), para. 97.\n\n*Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Bizkaia Ur Partzuergoa v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Decision on Jurisdiction (19 December 2012), para. 257.\n\n5.44.\n\nGiven these considerations, the Tribunal decides that it must next examine whether the additional jurisdictional objections have been raised as early as possible by the Respondent, even though they were raised before the expiration of the deadline for the filing of its Counter-Memorial.\n\n5.45.\n\nBased on a review of the Parties' pleadings throughout these proceedings (including the preliminary and jurisdictional phase, as well as the Notice of Arbitration), the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's submissions as to the timeliness of its objections, as jurisdictional objections to the Claimant's claims, in regard to: (i) the exclusion of claims beyond the scope of the Investment Law; (ii) the exclusive jurisdiction of the Salvadoran courts; and (iii) the application of the Salvadoran statute of limitations. The Respondent has submitted that these objections could not have been anticipated before the Claimant's Memorial on the Merits and concern issues that had not been raised in El Salvador's previous ICSID arbitrations or earlier in this arbitration.83 However, as explained below, the Tribunal considers that these jurisdictional objections could and should have been raised by the Respondent earlier in this arbitration.\n\nSee paras. 5.25-5.27 above.\n\n5.46.\n\nAs to the objection regarding the exclusion of claims beyond the scope of the Investment Law, the Tribunal notes that it does not rest upon any new facts or submissions put forward by the Claimant in the merits phase of this arbitration. Already at the first phase of this arbitration, the Claimant submitted that rules of international law applied to its claims under the Investment Law; and it referred to the Respondent's obligations under international law as well as to those under the Salvadoran Constitution.84 The Tribunal therefore decides that the Respondent has not raised its objection at the earliest possibility as required under the \"primary rule\" imposed by the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 82, 90 & 123.\n\n5.47.\n\nThe objection as to the exclusive jurisdiction of Salvadoran courts under Article 8 of the Mining Law in regard to the Claimant's claims concerns legislation already actively referred to in this arbitration's earlier jurisdictional phase.85 It is directly pertinent to the jurisdictional question of the Respondent's consent to ICSID Arbitration under Article 15(a) of the Investment Law; and, as such, it should have been raised by the Respondent in that jurisdictional phase. Therefore, the Respondent's additional jurisdictional objection is not a response at the earliest possible time to a new matter arising from the Claimant's pleadings. Moreover, the Respondent's denial at having faced a similar issue in previous arbitrations does not establish that the objection was raised as early as possible; nor does it exonerate the Respondent from the requirement to do so under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 61; Jur Tr. D1.34, 37-40, 42-43, 51-52, 52 & 62-63 Respondent's Post-hearing Brief on Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 131 & 137; Respondent's Preliminary Objections under Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 of the CAFTA, paras. 36-58, 68, 70 & 89.\n\n5.48.\n\nIn regard to the objection concerning the Salvadoran statute of limitations, the Tribunal notes that the objection does not rest upon any new facts or submissions by the Claimant's Memorial on the Merits. Rather, it concerns the invocation of the Respondent's own legislation. The Claimant has advanced submissions in regard to the El Dorado Project and the Investment Law since the very start of this arbitration in April 2009.86 The Tribunal therefore decides that the Respondent could and should have raised its jurisdictional objection that is based on its own Civil Code much earlier in the proceedings (assuming, in the Respondent's favour, that such an objection can found an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction).\n\nSee Notice of Arbitration, paras. 54-65.\n\n5.49.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the Respondent has failed to fulfil the \"as early as possible\" requirement of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) in regard to its additional jurisdictional objections to the Claimant's pleaded claims on: (i) the exclusion of all claims beyond the scope of the Investment Law; (ii) the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of El Salvador; and (iii) the application of the Salvadoran statute of limitations. These objections have not been raised at the earliest possibility, even if they were raised before the expiration of the time limit for the Respondent's Counter-Memorial (on the merits).\n\n5.50.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal is also aware of its mandate under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention and of its power under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) to consider, \"at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.\"87 With this in mind, the Tribunal has the power to examine, upon its own initiative at any time, any jurisdictional question it considers pertinent, even if it entails a matter that was raised belatedly by a party or not raised by any party at all. Within this limited scope, upon its own initiative, the Tribunal will address later below the additional jurisdictional objections belatedly raised by the Respondent.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2). Cf. also Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.51.\n\nFinally, as to the request for reconsideration of the Tribunal's Jurisdiction Decision regarding the Respondent's objection based upon alleged abuse of process and misrepresentation by the Claimant, the Tribunal observes that this request is based on new information arguably first made available by the Claimant in its Memorial on the Merits, thus making the Respondent's Counter-Memorial the first opportunity for the Respondent to respond to it. Since the Respondent first raised this jurisdictional objection in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, the Tribunal considers that it may have been raised timeously, \"as early as possible\" in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1). However, as with the Respondent's other objections, the Tribunal prefers to address also this objection upon its own initiative under ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1) and (2).\n\n*(ii) The Consideration of the Additional Objections to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.52.\n\n*(ii) Abuse of Process Objection:* In its Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections of 1 June 2012, the Tribunal decided, based upon the Parties' respective cases at that time, that:\n\n\"... the de facto ban forming the legal and factual basis pleaded for [the Claimant's] CAFTA claims [...] became known to the Claimant only from the public report of President Saca's reported speech on 11 March 2008; and that, also as such, it was not known to or foreseen by the Claimant before 13 December 2007 as an actual or specific future dispute with the Respondent under CAFTA.\"88\n\nDecision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, para. 2,109.\n\n5.53.\n\nAfter considering all relevant aspects, the Tribunal reached the following decision on the Respondent's abuse of process objection to the Claimant's claims:\n\n\"For these reasons, in the circumstances of the present case, taking into particular consideration the Claimant's claims as finally pleaded and explained to this Tribunal, the Tribunal determines that the change in the Claimant's nationality on 13 December 2007, on all the evidential materials adduced by the Parties in these proceedings, is not proven to have been an abuse of process precluding the exercise of the Tribunal's jurisdiction to determine such claims under CAFTA and the ICSID Convention; and the Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent's case on the Abuse of Process issue.\"89\n\n*Ibid*. para. 2,110.\n\n5.54.\n\nIn rejecting the Respondent's objection, the Tribunal also observed:\n\n\"However, the Tribunal considers that the Abuse of Process issue does not apply to the Claimant's claims under the Investment Law which are not made under CAFTA and made with an independent right to invoke ICSID Arbitration.\"90\n\n*Ibid*. para. 2,111.\n\n5.55.\n\nThe Respondent now requests the Tribunal to reconsider its rejection of the abuse of process objection in the light of a new fact relating to the Claimant's awareness of a (foreseeable) dispute prior to its nationality change. However, the Tribunal has already denied jurisdiction over the CAFTA claims pleaded by the Claimant. It is only in relation to those CAFTA claims that the question arose of whether the nationality change constituted an abuse of process. For the non-CAFTA claims at issue under the Investment Law, it is without consequence whether the nationality change occurred with or without knowledge by the Claimant of any (foreseeable) dispute.\n\n5.56.\n\nGiven that both the United Kingdom and the United States of America were (and remain) Contracting Parties to the ICSID Convention (unlike CAFTA), the Claimant could have invoked Article 15(a) of the Investment Law without any need to change its nationality from the Cayman Islands (as a British Overseas Territory) to the United States of America.91 The consequences of the Claimant's nationality change and the reasons for it were therefore at the time and remain a moot point in relation to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the Investment Law, as invoked by the Claimant.\n\nAs already observed in the Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, para. 5.43.\n\n5.57.\n\nAccordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal declines to revise its Jurisdiction Decision of 1 June 2012 on the rejection of the abuse of process objection made by the Respondent. In short, that objection was relevant to the Claimant's claims under CAFTA; and those claims are no longer present in this arbitration as a result of the Tribunal's Decision. This particular objection is not relevant or material to the Claimant's surviving claims under the Investment Law.\n\n5.58.\n\n*(ii) Piercing the Corporate Veil:* The Respondent also submits that its requested reconsideration requires the Tribunal to reconsider its objection relating to the piercing of the Claimant's corporate veil.92 The Tribunal rejects this further submission. It is not convinced that the piercing of the corporate veil would be appropriate or necessary. In order for it to be justified, as an exception to determining the nationality of a company by reference to its incorporation or seat, there must be specific factors or compelling reasons that call for an inquiry into the company's actual ownership and control.93 These are absent in the present case. The mere fact that the Claimant (with PRES and DOREX) is or was an associated company of Pacific Rim Mining Corporation (or any other company) does not constitute a misuse or abuse of its corporate structure. Moreover, without more, the ICSID Convention does not require such an inquiry into a claimant in order to establish its nationality under Article 25(1).94 Nor does the Investment Law require such an examination. Accordingly, there is here no legal requirement or reason for the Tribunal to pierce the corporate veil of the Claimant.\n\nCf. Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, paras. 5.12 and 5.26.\n\nCf. *Case Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v Spain)*, Judgment, Second Phase, 5 Feb. 1970, ICJ Rep. 1970, paras. 56-63; E.C. Schlemmer, 'Investment, Investor, Nationality, and Shareholders', P. Muchlinski, F. Ortino and C. Schreuer (eds.), *The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law* (Oxford Univ. Press 2008) 75-80; C.H. Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edition, Cambridge Univ. Press, 2009) 281, including the decisions cited to this effect.\n\nCf. C.H. Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edition, Cambridge Univ. Press, 2009) pp 165ff, including the arbitral decisions cited to this effect.\n\n5.59.\n\nBased on these considerations, the Tribunal declines to revise its Jurisdiction Decision of 1 June 2012 in regard to the questions of piercing of the Claimant's corporate veil.\n\n5.60.\n\n*(iii) Applicable Law(s):* In conformity with Article 42(1) of the Convention, the Tribunal is to decide the Parties' dispute in accordance with such rules of law as agreed by the Parties, or, in the absence thereof, Salvadoran law as the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute \"and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" The Parties disagree on: (i) whether there is any agreement on the applicable law or laws; and (ii) whether Salvadoran law applies to the exclusion of relevant rules of international law.95\n\nSee paras. 2-10.\n\n5.61.\n\nAs to the existence of any agreement between the Parties on the applicable law(s), the Tribunal observes that the Investment Law does not contain a provision that specifies the law to be applied to disputes that might arise thereunder between the Respondent and a foreign investor. There is no other agreement on applicable law between the Parties. Therefore, in accordance with the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal decides that it must apply Salvadoran law, being the law of the Contracting State party to this arbitration, and also such rules of international law as may be applicable to the Parties' dispute.\n\n5.62.\n\nHaving decided that Salvadoran and (if and to the extent relevant) rules of international law apply, the Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent's submission based on its domestic law to the effect that claims relying on principles of international law must be rejected as a matter of jurisdiction. It is well established that a State cannot justify the non-observance of its international obligations in an international arbitration by invoking provisions of its domestic law.96 Moreover, arbitral practice under and scholarly commentaries on Article 42(1), second sentence, of the ICSID Convention confirm the parallel application and corrective function of international law in relation to domestic law.97 The Tribunal accepts, as was held in the award in *Inceysa,* that \"in order to invoke the arbitration jurisdiction provided in the Investment Law, there must be a claim with substantive grounds in said law.\"98 However, this approach does not mean that such law can exclude applicable rules of international law in the absence of a choice of law clause to that effect.\n\nCf.

Moreover, the Constitution is explicitly referred to in various provisions of the Investment Law.100 The Tribunal therefore decides that the claims pleaded by the Claimant that invoke the Constitution of El Salvador alongside the Investment Law are within the scope of its jurisdiction.\n\n*Ibid,* see para. 7.\n\nSee Articles. 7, 8 and 13 of the Investment Law.\n\n5.65.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the jurisdictional objection that the claims relying on rules of international law and the Constitution of El Salvador are beyond the scope of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n5.66.\n\n*(iv) Exclusive Jurisdiction of Salvadoran Courts:* In its Jurisdiction Decision of 1 June 2012, the Tribunal decided:\n\n\"... that the wording of Article 15 of the Investment Law contains the Respondent's consent to submit the resolution of disputes with foreign investors to ICSID jurisdiction; that such intention appears unambiguously from the text of Article 15; and that it is confirmed from the context, the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served by Article 15, read with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\"\n\n5.67.\n\nNotwithstanding this decision, the Respondent has now submitted that Article 7(b) of the Investment Law,101 read with Article 7 of the Mining Law (the latter establishing the exclusive jurisdiction of Salvadoran courts)102 negates the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Investment Law and the ICSID Convention.\n\nArticle 7, chapeau and (b), of the Investment Law (as translated in RL-9bis) provides: \"In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic and secondary laws, investments will be limited in the following activities and terms: [\u2026] (b) The subsoil belongs to the State, which may grant concessions for its exploitation; [\u2026]\" (see the full text in Spanish in Part II).\n\nArticle 7 of the Mining Law (as translated in RL-7bis) provides: \"The Mining License or Concession Holders, be they national or foreign, are subject to the laws, Courts and Authorities of the Republic, and are absolutely precluded from resorting to claims in the diplomatic protection venue; and the respective contracts must establish that in everything related to the application, interpretation, performance or termination of the same, they waive their domicile and submit themselves to the Courts of San Salvador\" (see the full text in Spanish in Part II).\n\n5.68.\n\nHowever, questions of jurisdiction over a claimant's claims are not (in the absence of a specific agreement to that effect) necessarily governed by the same law that applies to the merits of the parties' dispute. Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention addresses the law that applies to the merits of the dispute, not to decisions on jurisdiction.103 Determining the existence and scope of the consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre and this Tribunal under Article 15(a) of the Investment Law is a question to be decided by the Tribunal in accordance with Articles 25 and 41(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal is not bound by the State's own interpretation of Article 15(a); nor will it apply other legislative provisions that would override an expression of jurisdictional consent that is valid, clear and unambiguous as a matter international law.104\n\nCf. *CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (17 July 2003), para. 88; C.H. Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edition, Cambridge Univ. Press, 2009) 551.\n\nCf. also *Wena v Egypt - annulment*, para. 41 *; Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited. v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, Decision on Jurisdiction (14 April 1988), paras. 38-39.\n\n5.69.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore cannot accept that the exclusive jurisdiction of Salvadoran courts under Article 7 of the Mining Law would negate automatically its jurisdiction under Article 15 of the Investment Law, in regard to all claims pleaded by the Claimant in this ICSID arbitration. There is a further reason: the Claimant itself was never a licensee or applicant under the Mining Law for any licence or permit (whether for exploration or exploitation concession). It had no standing by itself to commence legal proceedings against the Respondent before a Salvadoran Court under Article 7 of the Mining Law. That possibility was confined to PRES and DOREX, both Salvadoran companies, a point to which the Tribunal returns below. Accordingly, Article 7 of the Mining Law could not impede the Claimant's own invocation of Article 15(a) of the Investment Law in regard to its own pleaded claims, as a matter of jurisdiction under the Investment Law and the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.70.\n\nBased on these reasons, the Tribunal finds no good reason to revise its Decision of 1 June 2012 in regard to its jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims pleaded under the Investment Law. The Tribunal accordingly confirms its jurisdiction under Article 15(a) of the Investment Law and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.71.\n\n*(v) Salvadoran Statute of Limitation:* The Respondent has also belatedly invoked provisions of the Salvadoran Civil Code as a basis for its objection that the Claimant's El Dorado claims are time-barred under Salvadoran Law and therefore should be rejected by the Tribunal as a matter of jurisdiction: namely, Articles 2231(2), 2253 and 2083 of the Civil Code. The Tribunal finds no merit in this jurisdictional objection. As decided above, the fact that a provision of Salvadoran legislation provides the consent to arbitration does not mean that the Tribunal's decisions on jurisdiction are governed by Salvadoran law. Domestic law cannot automatically negate the Respondent's international obligation that has been established by its consent to ICSID arbitration under Article 15(a) of the Investment Law and the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.72.\n\nMoreover, international investment tribunals are not necessarily bound to apply domestic statutes of limitations.105 While a tribunal may decide to take such limitations into account in deciding whether a claim has been unreasonably delayed in a particular case, neither the Investment Law nor the ICSID Convention require this Tribunal to do so. In the present case, the Tribunal sees no need for it to exercise a discretion in this regard in favour of the Respondent as a matter of jurisdiction. This is even more so taking into account the Respondent's failure to raise its objection in a timely manner, over three-and-a-half years after the submission of its objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal on 3 August 2010, and one-and-half years after the Tribunal's Jurisdictional Decision of 1 June 2012. Further, even if applicable, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent's plea of limitation under the Salvadoran Civil Code operates, in any event, as a bar to the Claimant's claims as a matter of jurisdiction (as opposed to merits).\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award (8 December 2000), paras. 106-107; *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Award (13 November 2000), para. 93; *Alan Craig v Ministry of Energy of Iran*, et al., Award No. 71-34 6-3, 2 Sept. 1983, 3 Iran-U.S. CTR (1984), 280 at 287; *Gentini Case, Mixed Claims Comm.

Cf. *Pious Fund Case (United States of America v Mexico),* Award, 14 October 1902, 9 RIAA 1 at 13.\n\n5.73.\n\nBased on all these considerations, the Tribunal decides that the three-year statute of limitation under the Salvadoran Civil Code does not require the Tribunal to reject the El Dorado claims pleaded by the Claimant, as a matter of jurisdiction.\n\n***D. The Tribunal's Decision***\n--------------------------------\n\n5.74.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, in regard to the first of the principal issues listed in Part IV above, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's additional jurisdictional objections. Accordingly, the Tribunal re-affirms its jurisdiction pursuant to Article 15(a) of the Investment Law and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention to decide the Claimant's claims at issue in this merits phase of the arbitration; and the Tribunal confirms its Decision of 1 June 2012 (which, as already indicated, is incorporated in and therefore forms part of this Award).\n\n**PART VI: THE TRIBUNAL'S FACTUAL CHRONOLOGY - EL DORADO**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n6.1.\n\n*Introduction* : The Tribunal here addresses the factual background to the Claimant's claims in regard to the El Dorado Project. It largely confines those facts, for reasons to become apparent later below, to those relevant to the second principal issue identified in Part IV(B)(2) above under Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. As regards the first sub-issue of this statutory provision's legal interpretation, the primary facts are relatively few and mostly (but not completely) undisputed between the Parties. However, as regards the second sub-issue of \"estoppel\" or \"actos propios\", it is necessary to explain the full factual context in which the Parties' dispute arose under Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law, which are much in dispute between the Parties. It is appropriate to recite this context in the form of the evidential chronology which follows below, citing much of the contemporary documentation as also explained by the Parties' witnesses in their written evidence and their oral testimony at the hearing.\n\n***B. 1995***\n-------------\n\n6.2.\n\n*1995:* The chronology begins with the Respondent's Mining Law of 14 December 1995. It was a new mining code, later amended in 2001 (the \"Mining Law\", also sometimes called \"the Mining Law of 1996\", the year in which it came into legal effect).106 This was not the Respondent's first mining law: it had enacted Mining Codes in 1881 and 1922. The 1922 Mining Code had been influenced by the mining laws of other mining countries, including Argentina, Peru, Mexico, Spain, France and the USA.107 By 1911, the Respondent's Bureau of Statistics recorded 180 mineral mines in El Salvador.108 At this time, mineral mining in El Salvador (including gold) involved surface outcrops and excavation work proceeding from the surface: it was not underground mining.109 The Respondent had also enacted the Complimentary Law of 1953, affecting the 1922 Mining Code.\n\nRL-7 (bis).\n\nCLA-207.\n\nC-297, Table at page 185.\n\nWilliams ER 1, page 11.\n\n***C. 2001-2002***\n------------------\n\n6.3.\n\n*2001:* The 1995 Mining Law pre-dated the Claimant's acquisition of its exploration licences upon its amalgamation (or merger) with Dayton Mining in April 2002.110 The text of this Mining Law formed part of Pac Rim's due diligence for its amalgamation, as recognised by the Claimant in this arbitration in its written pleadings: \"In connection with its due diligence for the Dayton merger, Pacific Rim of course studied and relied upon the new Mining Law and Mining Regulations that had been enacted in 1996, as well as the 2001 amendments. While those amendments - which extended the number of years for which exploration licenses could be granted - were under review, on June 28, 2001, the Government issued Decree No. 456. This decree extended the validity of all exploration licenses due to expire in 2001 until the end of the year, in order to allow the Legislative Assembly sufficient time to promulgate the amendments to the Mining Law that were necessary to allow for further extensions of the relevant licenses.\"111 In his testimony, Mr Shrake confirmed that Pac Rim had conducted legal due diligence for its amalgamation with Dayton in 2002; and that this exercise had included a study of the Mining Law and the Mining Regulations.112\n\nC-230 (As explained in Part I above, the Claimant and its parent company Pacific Rim are collectively described as \"Pac Rim\").\n\nRequest, para. 45.\n\nTr. D2,307-308.\n\n6.4.\n\nIt can thus be readily assumed that the Claimant, assisted by its several legal advisers and mining specialists, was familiar with the texts of the Mining Law and associated Mining Regulations before its indirect acquisition of the exploration licences to be held by PRES. It is also to be noted that, from the outset, the Claimant, with its senior executives (particularly Ms McLeod Selzer and Mr Shrake) had significant experience, expertise and practical knowledge of gold mining, including underground mines.\n\n6.5.\n\nThe Claimant's senior executives were also skilled at international business, in its broadest aspects, including dealings with the Respondent's Government and Legislative Assembly. Prior to its amalgamation with Dayton Mining in April 2002, the Claimant \"had a hand in helping the Government draft\" the 2001 amendment to the 1995 Mining Law \"so that El Salvador would be open and receptive to mining investment and allow deposits to be developed in a timely way\", according to a public statement made in 2004 to the \"Wall Street Transcript\" by Ms McLeod Seltzer (of the Claimant).113 She there also described El Salvador as having \"very friendly mining laws.\"\n\nC-336.\n\n6.6.\n\n*2002:* This chronology addresses Pac Rim's El Dorado Project, acquired and evolved from Dayton Mining and Kinross in the form of exploration licences. This project lay in the San Isidoro District, some 7.5 km south west of the city of Sensuntepeque.114 The exploration area was comprised of \"El Dorado Norte\" and \"El Dorado Sur.\" The smaller concession area was to be called \"El Dorado.\" It was to include smaller areas known as \"Minita\" and \"Minita 3\" (see the maps in Part III).\n\nC-613.\n\n6.7.\n\nFollowing their acquisition in April 2002, the exploration licences now held indirectly by the Claimant (through PRES) had less than three years to run, being set to expire on 1 January 2005 unless converted into an exploitation concession under the Mining Law. From the outset, the Claimant understood the importance of this statutory deadline: Mr Gehlen (for the Claimant) had noted this deadline as an \"important issue\" during the Claimant's due diligence exercise in 2002:. Exploitation needs to go forward in 3 years or loose [sic: lose] concession at El Dorado (under new mining law and regulations, 3 years out of 8 years remain).\"115 This statutory deadline of 1 January 2005, non-extendable, was to have an important effect on subsequent events.\n\nC-618.\n\n6.8.\n\nThe Claimant's due diligence, prior to the amalgamation in 2002, included the Respondent's earlier mining study of February 1998, prepared by its Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) on \"the Development and Perspectives of Mining Activity in El Salvador.\" It included the following passages:116 \"The current Law on Mining [i.e. the Mining Law of 1995], unlike the repealed Code [the old Mining Law of 1922], does not consider the mining industry to be of public interest, and therefore this Law does not contemplate the concept of expropriation. Any person who requests a mining concession must first prove the availability of the property which the concession will affect, which must be done by means of an instrument of ownership of the property or authorization legally granted by the owner.....and [The] Law on Mining treats surface ownership in a very different manner from civil law. For [the] Law on Mining, the subsurface is something that is fundamental, and so the surface is generally of little importance because of the very nature of mining activity.\"\n\nC-622, pp 23-25.\n\n6.9.\n\nThe Tribunal considers these passages materially ambiguous as to the requirement of the Mining Law for the applicant's ownership or authorization regarding the surface area of the 'affected property'.117 There was also a linguistic dispute between the Parties at the hearing as to the accurate translation of these passages into English.118 Hence the Tribunal has here worked directly from the original Spanish text. In this Spanish text, however, the wording leaves the question open as to how and what surface area is affected by underground mining; and the later reference to the surface being generally of little importance for mining provides little useful guidance. With hindsight, it is possible to infer that the affected property was here to extend beyond the surface area actually occupied by the mine's infrastructure; but, equally, that it might not extend to the full surface area of the concession. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the study's named author (Mr Ticay) was a geologist and not a Salvadoran lawyer (although, as Mr Ticay testified, he had access to Dr M\u00e9ndez, a lawyer who had participated in drafting the 1995 Mining Law).119 Accordingly, for all these reasons, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's submission that this is a \"very clear statement published to the mining community in 1998 before [the] Claimant ever invested.\"120\n\nIn the original Spanish text: \"... la disponibilidad del inmueble sobre la cual recaer\u00e1 la concesi\u00f3n\"; C-622, p 23.\n\nContrast Tr. D4,834-835 (The Claimant prefers \"..'that will be affected by the Concession') and Tr. D.7.1955-1956. (The Respondent prefers \".. 'which will be covered by the Concession'. that means the area of the concession\").\n\nTr. D4,860.\n\nTr. D1,193.\n\n6.10.\n\nIn any event, there is no evidence adduced in this arbitration that representatives of the Claimant or PRES so understood this passage before the Claimant indirectly acquired its exploration licences upon the amalgamation with Dayton in 2002. Mr Shrake testified that he only had \"a vague recollection\" of the publication.121\n\nTr. D2,326.\n\n6.11.\n\nIn its Annual Technical Report for 2002 submitted to the Respondent's Department of Mines, Kinross (later named PRES) had described the El Dorado Project.122 Section 3 entitled \"Description of the Project\" (page 6, paragraph 3, last sentence) read: \"Also, the land where it would conduct additional discovery activities requiring out surface works must be purchased.\" The Claimant contends that it understood from this report at the time of its investment, in the words of its counsel at the hearing, that \"it needed to obtain ownership or authorization only over the land where it would be carrying out surface works, a reasonable understanding and one consistent with the experience of the Company's staff in other jurisdictions.\"123 In the Tribunal's view, this report (including the passage cited above) could not reasonably have influenced the Claimant at the time in the manner alleged by its counsel; and there is no cogent evidence from any of its witnesses that it did.\n\nC-349.\n\nTr. D1,145, re Slide 4.71.\n\n6.12.\n\nAt that time, the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of Pacific Rim, was Mr Tom Shrake (a post he had held since 1997). Mr Shrake testified that he was the executive ultimately responsible for all of the decisions made with respect to its Salvadoran companies (PRES and DOREX). The President of PRES, answerable to Mr Shrake, was Mr Earnest (until September 2006). Mr Earnest was not called by the Claimant as a witness in this arbitration. Mr Earnest was succeeded at PRES by Mr Gehlen. Mr Shrake and Mr Gehlen testified in this arbitration, both in writing and orally at the hearing.\n\n***D. 2004***\n-------------\n\n6.13.\n\n*December 2004:* By 2004, as Mr Shrake testified, the Claimant and PRES had verified substantial gold deposits within the license areas for El Dorado Norte and El Dorado Sur.124 On 22 December 2004, PRES applied to the Ministry of Economy to convert its two exploration licences for El Dorado Norte and El Dorado Sur into an exploitation concession for El Dorado.125 This written application was submitted by Mr Earnest for PRES to Ms Gina Navas de Hern\u00e1ndez as the Director of the Ministry's Bureau of Hydrocarbons and Mines (the \"Bureau\").\n\nShrake 1 WS, para. 71.\n\nC-5, R-2, C-181, C-6; C-10.\n\n6.14.\n\nThe date of this application was significant: PRES' two existing exploration licences for El Dorado Sur and El Dorado Norte, upon which PRES' application for an exploitation concession rested under the Mining Law, were about to expire on 1 January 2005 with no further possibility for PRES to extend them under the Mining Law. The explanation is complicated; but it does not appear to be materially disputed between the Parties. On 10 July 1996, Kinross obtained a 3-year exploration license for El Dorado Norte and on 23 July 1996 a 3-year exploration license for El Dorado Sur.126 On 15 July 1999, Kinross obtained 2-year extensions for both El Dorado exploration licenses, bringing the total periods for both licenses to 5 years (the statutory maximum at that time), expiring in July 2001.127 On 11 July 2001, the Salvadoran Legislative Decree No. 456 extended all exploration licenses for that year until 31 December 200 1.128 On 11 July 2001, the 1991 Amendment to the 1995 Mining Law also extended the statutory maximum period for exploration licences from 4 years to 8 years.129 On 10 December 2001, pursuant to this 1991 Amendment, Kinross obtained second 2-year extensions for both El Dorado exploration licenses.130 On 18 December 2003, PRES (having changed its name from Kinross upon the Claimant's amalgamation with Dayton Mining) obtained further 1-year extensions of the two El Dorado exploration licenses, beginning on 1 January 2004. These extensions brought the total periods of the two exploration licenses to eight years, being the new statutory maximum, thereby finally expiring on 1 January 2005 under the Mining Law.131\n\nC-326 & C-317.\n\nC-329, C- 330.\n\nCLA-211.\n\nCLA-212.\n\nC-268, C-269.\n\nC-13.\n\n6.15.\n\nThe original application by PRES of 22 December 2004 recorded the area of the two existing exploration licences as 29.87 sq. km and 45.13 sq. km (totalling 75 sq. km). The geographical limits of the requested exploitation concession were shown in the attached maps, marked \"Map 1\" and \"Map 2\". The total concession area was said to be 12.75 sq. km.132 Mr Shrake confirmed, during his testimony, that this was and remained the total area of the concession requested by PRES in its application to the Bureau under the Mining Law.133 Sensuntepeque and San Isidro, the nearest towns, were located some 12 kilometres from the El Dorado site, outside the requested concession area.\n\nR-2, p.9.\n\nTr. D2,319 & D2,351.\n\n6.16.\n\nIt appears from the evidence that the outer contours of this total area of 12.75 sq. km were later adjusted, in or about August 2005, by agreement between PRES and the Bureau. In PRES's project report of 31 August 2005, eight months after PRES' original application, Mr Earnest reported to the Claimant: \"At the same time as the requests were made for the new exploration licenses in the name of [DOREX], new documents were presented for the conversion of the El Dorado North and South exploration licenses to the El Dorado Exploitation Concession. The area of the concession is now 12.75 km\u00b2 and is contiguous to the limits of the three new exploration licenses.\"134 As the Claimant itself acknowledges, \"the documentary record is not entirely clear.\"135 It may only be that the precise contours of PRES' requested concession were modified to fit with the areas of the three new exploration licences for Pueblos, Guaco and Huacaco granted to DOREX by the Bureau in late September 2005. In any event, such minor modifications are not material to the issues addressed in this Award. The total area of 12.75 sq.km remained the same, as appears to be common ground between the Parties. It may also be that, as Mr Gehlen testified, the change in August 2005 was only the product of PRES' data being converted to the Cartesian co-ordinate system used by the Bureau,136 (The Tribunal returns separately to these exploration licences for Huacaco, Pueblos and Guaco in Part IX below).\n\nC-288.\n\nMemorial, para. 210.\n\nGehlen WS, para. 109.\n\n6.17.\n\nThe original application by PRES of 22 December 2004 included documentation said by PRES to comply with Article 37(a) to (f) of the Mining Law, including \"Deeds or Legal Authorizations.\" That documentation, with Sections 3 and 4 of the application, was said to comprise \"a description of the surface lands that will be directly affected by the construction and operation of the mine and the plant. There are a total of six properties. All have been purchased, except for the property of Mr [SM], who has an agreement with Pacific Rim for a future purchase under a lease with an option to buy.\" The area of these six properties (5 purchased and 1 leased) was shown in the attached \"Map 5.\"\n\n6.18.\n\nIt is self-evident from this latter map that the surface area of these six properties is significantly smaller than the total surface area of the requested concession. It related only to that part of the surface area said by PRES to be directly impacted by the requested concession, including the plant, tailings dam, ramp portal, the road and the opening of the ventilation stack of the proposed underground mine. It did not include, therefore, the remaining surface area of the requested concession.\n\n6.19.\n\nMr Shrake acknowledged during his testimony that PRES had not provided documentation, as to authorizations or ownership, for the entire surface area of the requested concession, but only \"for the areas that we were going to disturb on the surface.\"137 Of the entire surface area of 12.75 sq. km, the disturbed surface area was thus less than 13% of the total area requested, equating to less than 2 sq. km out of 12.75 sq. km.\n\nTr. D2,359-360.\n\n6.20.\n\nAs Ms Navas testified, upon her Bureau's receipt of PRES' application: \"... they [PRES] did not have all of the permits to be granted by the landowners or the permits that proved ownership of the Concession land. If my memory serves me right, they only presented or submitted five documents that showed that they were the owners of the land, and another one that was being leased. I don't think that that even accounted for 13 percent of the total area requested. I added up [on the morning of her testimony] the area covered by the land that they - that had been presented by them with a title. But to be truthful, it was 12.65 percent.\"138 As Mr Ticay (of the Bureau) also testified, in writing and orally at the hearing, \"Neither myself nor anybody else at the Bureau of Hydrocarbons and Mines who reviewed the Pacific Rim concession application had any doubt that the Pacific Rim application failed to comply with this requirement\", that requirement being \"the ownership requirements\" of Article 37(2)(b) for the full surface area of the requested concession.139 (Mr Ticay had worked at the Bureau as a geologist from April 1997; and he had drafted the 1998 study described above).\n\nTr. D3,694.\n\nTicay WS, para. 6; Tr. D4,828-829.\n\n6.21.\n\nAlso, PRES' application did not contain any environmental permit, as required by Article 37(2)(c) of the Mining Law. Earlier, in March 2004, PRES had applied for such a permit to MARN; and PRES was also working on its Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIA\") for submission to MARN.140 No environmental permit could be submitted with PRES' application because of delays caused by MARN. However, the Bureau had earlier assured PRES, by Ms Navas' letter dated 25 August 2004, that its omission would not preclude PRES' application for an exploitation concession: \"I hereby refer to your letter dated August 23 of this year [2004], in which you inquire if your rights to seek the concession for El Dorado North and El Dorado South would be affected in the case Environmental Permit is not awarded by December 31st [2004]. To answer your question, when the company presents documentation showing that the MARN (Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources) has not awarded the permit, and provided that it doesn't take too long, your rights will not be affected.\"141 It is thus unnecessary for present purposes to describe the further difficulties experienced by PRES with MARN over the required environmental permit: that omission plays no material part below in the Tribunal's analyses and decisions.\n\nShrake 1 WS, para. 71.\n\nNoA, Exhibit 6.\n\n6.22.\n\nOne of the documents referenced in PRES' application was the SRK Preliminary Feasibility Study, submitted by PRES (subject to revision) ostensibly under Article 37(2)(d) of the Mining Law.142 That document was to generate considerable controversy, particularly as to whether it met the statutory requirement for a \"Technical-Economic Feasibility Study.\" Again, it is unnecessary for present purposes to describe the further difficulties experienced by PRES over this further requirement: those difficulties, whether resolved one way or the other, play no material part below in the Tribunal's analyses and decisions.\n\nC-5.\n\n6.23.\n\nAnother document submitted in support of PRES' application was the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) submitted by PRES ostensibly under Article 37(2)(c) of the Mining Law.143 That document was also to generate considerable controversy. Again, it is unnecessary for present purposes to describe the further difficulties experienced by PRES over this further requirement: those difficulties, whether resolved one way or the other, play no material part below in the Tribunal's analyses and decisions.\n\nC-5.\n\n***E. 2005***\n-------------\n\n6.24.\n\n*January 2005* : On 1 January 2005, having come to the end of their respective maximum terms, PRES' exploration licences for El Dorado Norte and El Dorado Sur expired under the Mining Law. However, PRES had now pending with the Bureau its application for an exploitation concession for 12.75 sq. km of the previously licensed area of 75 sq. km. That application being supported by the Ministry of Economy, PRES was permitted to continue drilling at El Dorado without hindrance from the Respondent, notwithstanding the absence of any extant exploration licence or exploitation concession. As the Respondent's counsel recognised at the hearing, \"... there can be no doubt that this drilling was not in conformity with Salvadoran law.\"144 The Respondent's counsel also explained that: \"... It was part of the understanding of the Bureau of Mines that it was giving time to Pacific Rim to complete the requirements [as regards its feasibility study], that was a necessary part of that intention to allow them to continue drilling.\"145\n\nTr. D7.1977.\n\nTr. D7.1979.\n\n6.25.\n\n*March 2005* : On 18 March 200 5,146 by email message to Mr Shrake in the USA, Mr Earnest informed the Claimant that Ms Gina Navas (the Director of the Bureau) had informed him earlier that morning that: \"we [PRES] are going to have to get the authorization of all the surface owners within the area of the concession.\" This was a reference to the requirement under Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.\n\nC-713.\n\n6.26.\n\nFrom the heading to his email, this news appears to have come to Mr Earnest as an unpleasant surprise. Mr Earnest had told Ms Navas that she was \"absolutely wrong.\" He advised Mr Shrake: \"I agree with the interpretation that in cases of surface impact, ownership, leasing or legal authorization is required, but in non-impacted areas it is dead wrong. It gives the 'Juan Embra'147 the final say as to whether the state minerals can be developed or not. She [Ms Navas] said she would discuss the matter with the lawyers to see 'IF' a solution was possible. I told her that there was no IF. There has to be a way, otherwise this country is not really in favor of developing its resources. I reiterated that there has to be a solution to this problem, because the interpretation is contrary to the intent of the law. She is to call me back after 'semanta santa' [i.e. Holy Week] to talk more after she has spoken to their lawyer...\" It appears from the same email message that Mr Earnest was also in contact with Mr Luis Medina, PRES' lawyer in El Salvador. Ms Navas' reference to discussing the matter with their lawyers referred, of course, to the Ministry's own lawyers. Ms Navas is not a lawyer; nor is Mr Earnest.\n\nAs Mr Shrake testified, this Spanish term equates colloquially to the English \"John Smith\": Tr. D2,335.\n\n6.27.\n\nAs Ms Navas testified, whilst other applications for larger exploitation areas were later raised by PRES and discussed with the Ministry of Economy, PRES' application for an exploitation area measuring 12.75 sq. km was never reduced.148 Ms Navas also testified: \"I personally informed Pacific Rim's representatives that what Pacific Rim should do is reduce the size of the concession requested to the area that could be justified based on the size of the deposit, which had undergone more technical and economic study (Minita) and that could also comply with the requirement concerning ownership of the surface area. However, Pacific Rim's representatives expressed to me that Pacific Rim was not interested in applying for such a small concession.\"149 In her oral testimony, Ms Navas further explained: \"I told [PRES] that if they did not have the capacity to submit the documents proving the ownership of all the property under the Concession, or the permits - the legally provided permits, they could reduce the area to the area for which they had property titles or permits. That's what I said.\"150\n\nTr. D3,691-692.\n\nNavas WS, para. 48.\n\nTr. D3,700.\n\n6.28.\n\nThe Tribunal attaches much significance to the informal and amicable manner in which the Bureau approached PRES. It was clearly intended to assist PRES and the Claimant. The Bureau could have sent, instead, a formal letter to PRES under Article 38 of the Mining Law (as it did much later, on 2 October 2006). However, such a formal letter would have started the thirty-day time limit under the Mining Law. That inevitably would have brought PRES' application to an abrupt end under the Bureau's interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. (The Tribunal here leaves aside for present purposes, as already indicated, other issues relating to the environmental permit and technical feasibility study required of PRES under Articles 37(2)(c) and (d) of the Mining Law).\n\n6.29.\n\nMr Shrake testified: \"... in March 2005, we were informed that some of the people in the Department of Mines held the view that PRES was required to acquire ownership or authorization to use the land surface overlaying the entire area of the concession. we disagreed with this view (as did our legal counsel), and were unsure how landowners who would not be impacted by our activities could give any 'authorization' for us to use the subsoil. After exchanging views with MINEC officials about this issue, we expected that it could be resolved, and proceeded to work with them to reach a solution.\"151 He also testified: \"... In consultation with our legal counsel in El Salvador, we had studied this issue closely. We believed that the Mining Law did not require ownership of or authorization to use the entire land surface overlaying the concession, and, moreover, that such a requirement was nonsensical for a variety of legal and practical reasons. Many of the Salvadoran officials with whom we spoke seemed to share our views. Even those officials who did not share our view that the language of the Mining Law was clear on this issue thought that a contrary reading of the law made no sense.\"152\n\nShrake 3 WS, paras. 32 & 33 (footnotes omitted).\n\nShrake 2 WS, para. 85.\n\n6.30.\n\n*April 2005* : In PRES' monthly report of 30 April 2005 to the Claimant,153 Mr Earnest reported as follows: \"Various conversations have been held to discuss the surficial extent of the exploitation concession and an area agreeable to the government and workable from our point of view has been defined. The 'Direcci\u00f3n de Minas' [the Bureau] has interpreted the law to imply that we must obtain authorization from every surface owner within the limits of the proposed concession. We are currently engaged in discussions with the 'Direcci\u00f3n de Minas' and will be presenting a legal brief for their consideration on May 5 [2005]. The Minister of Economy [Ms Yolanda de Gavidia] will be returning to the country in the following days, and if necessary, a meeting will be scheduled with her to advance this topic to resolution...\"\n\nC-290 (re-submitted).\n\n6.31.\n\n*May 2005* : On 5 May 2005, PRES's Salvadoran lawyer, Mr Luis Medina, submitted a memorandum to the Ministry of Economy, entitled \"Interpretation of Mining Law\", at the direction of the Claimant and PRES.154 It is a significant document for the Claimant's case; and, for the sake of completeness, it is here cited in full (with paragraph numbers marked thus [\u2026], here added for ease of reference):\n\n*\"[1] This legal opinion has been prepared based on the following questions regarding the Mining Law.*\n\n*[2] How should the requirement established in Article 37 No. 2 b) be interpreted?*\n\n*[3] If the exploitation concession for an underground mine covers more land than the land occupied by its aboveground facilities (which is owned by the concession holder) the question is: 'Will permission from the adjacent landowners be needed?'*\n\n*[4] It should be noted that the article in question (Article 37 No. 2 b)) includes in a single chapter the requirements for both metallic mineral deposits (mines) and non-metallic mineral deposits (quarries), and its proper interpretation will be arrived at by studying other provisions of the Mining Law as a whole. Indeed, as the analysis of the law progresses, the most appropriate interpretation emerges.*\n\n*Section I. Basic Definitions:*\n\n*[5] To begin, we must specify several definitions, for which purpose Article 2 of the Mining Law Regulations entitled Definition of Terms offers the following:*\n\n*10. Exploration: 'Surveying, prospecting and evaluation of mineral deposits using ecological, geochemical and geophysical methods, by means of excavating boreholes, tunnels and ditches; by drilling or any other geological research method that makes it possible to establish the economic value of the deposit and its characteristics.'*\n\n*11. Exploitation: 'The aboveground or underground construction and work used for preparation and development of the area that contains the mineral deposit, as well as the work aimed at detaching and extracting the mineral products existing therein.'*\n\n*12. 'Open Pit Mining: System by which the mineral fields or deposits are mined from the surface. In development and exploitation, underground works such as holes or shafts and galleries or tunnels are not used; instead, roads are built for the transportation of machinery, equipment and automotive vehicles.'*\n\n*14. Galleries or Tunnel: 'Horizontal excavation done for mining work.'*\n\n*17. Mine: 'Physical 'location, either aboveground or underground, where mineral substances are extracted.''*\n\n*29. Subsoil: 'Geologically, the layer situated under the soil.*\n\n*30. Soil: 'Exterior layer of the earth's crust in decomposition, consisting of fragments or remains of physically or chemically decomposed rocks and organic remains of plants and/or animals living in or on it'.*\n\n*Section II. Declaration of Ownership:*\n\n*[6] The mineral deposits contained in the subsoil of the Republic's territory, its continental platform and insular territory are the property of the State. Therefore, pursuant to Article 103 of the Salvadoran Constitution, the subsoil is property of the State [original emphasis]; and the exploration, exploitation, and processing of the same requires State authorization, whether for metallic mineral deposits (mines) or non-metallic deposits (quarries).*\n\n*[7] This same constitutional concept is, in turn, mentioned in Article 2 of the Mining Law (the Law), which establishes: 'All mineral deposits that exist in the subsoil of the territory of the Republic are State property, whatever their origin, form and physical state; as well as those in its continental shelf and insular territory, as established in the laws or international conventions ratified by the State. State ownership of these deposits is inalienable and is not subject to a statute of limitations.'Next, the same Article 2 explains: 'For the purposes of this Law, mineral deposits are classified into metallic and nonmetallic; the first shall be called mines, and the second, quarries.'*\n\n*[8] Article 10 establishes: 'The deposits to which this Law refers are real properties different than the real properties that constitute the surface land; this is not true of the quarries, which form an integral part of the land in which they are found, provided they are located flush with the ground.'*\n\n*[9] The Salvadoran Constitution and the Mining Law clearly establish that:*\n\n*(1) The mineral deposits are State property, and State ownership of them is inalienable and is not subject to a statute of limitations;*\n\n*(2) Metallic mineral deposits are real property different than the real property constituting the surface land; and*\n\n*(3) Non-metallic mineral deposits are real property that form an integral part of the surface land in which they are found.*\n\n*Section III Treatment of Permissions in the Mining Law:*\n\n*[10] The first call to obtain permission from landowners is found in Article 21 of the Law entitled 'Permissions'.*\n\n*[11] According to this article, the exploration license holder is responsible for obtaining the property owner's permission provided the following two requirements are met:*\n\n*(a) The work to be done involves land owned by others; and*\n\n*(b) The work to be performed is done on the surface of the soil.*\n\n*[12] This means that if the work to be done is carried out on land owned by the license holder or if, to the contrary, this work is carried out underground, i.e. in the subsoil (in other words, without involving work on the surface of the soil owned by third parties), NO PERMISSION IS REQUIRED FROM ANY LANDOWNER WHATSOEVER, but only the permission of the State intrinsic to the very authorization of the exploration license (or exploitation concession, as we will see).*\n\n*[13] In the case of the exploration license and if the two above requirements are met, the landowner's permission is required (except in the event that we will explain in Section V), because exploration work usually involves work conducted from the soil surface.*\n\n*[14] In turn, it is to be understood that for the exploitation phase, the holder will be responsible for obtaining the same permissions, whenever the two requirements mentioned above are met, except in the event that we will mention in Section V.*\n\n*[15] The second [requirement:\"llamado\"] to obtain permission from landowners is found in Article 30 of the Law entitled 'Exploitation Concession for Quarries'.*\n\n*[16] In the case of QUARRIES, as a clarification of what is found in Article 10, Article 30 provides that for the property where the quarry is located 'the person requesting the concession must own the requested property or have the legally granted authorization from its owner or occupant' (Article 30).*\n\n*Section IV. Legal Differentiation Between Mines And Quarries:*\n\n*[17] The Law has given different characteristics to metallic mineral and non-metallic mineral deposits, which are mined in the form of mines and quarries, respectively. Up to Article 37, these deposits are treated separately in the Law, but in Article 37 No. 2, the requirements for an exploitation concession for mines and quarries are combined. Letters a), c), d) and f) are easily combinable for the two types of deposits, but letter b) establishes the same obligation for mines and quarries, irrespective of the distinct characteristics recognized in all other parts of the Law.*\n\n*[18] Article 37, No. 2 b) provides that for a mining or quarry exploitation concession the 'Deed to the property or legally granted authorization from the owner' is always required, and by reason of Articles 2, 10, 21 and 30 cited above, these requirements must be considered separately, as follows:*\n\n*[19] An application for a QUARRY concession: always requires the 'Deed to the property or legally granted authorization from the owner' because this is required by Article 30 and previously established by Article 10.*\n\n*[20] An application for a MINING exploitation concession (except in the event that we will explain in Section V) requires:*\n\n*(a) the landowner's permission in the event that the concession involves work on the surface (consequence of Article 21); or*\n\n*(b) the permission of the owner of surface lands in the places where underground mines involve surface work (consequence of Article 21).*\n\n*[21] The exploitation of any deposit (of metallic or non-metallic minerals) requires the permission that must be given in all cases by the State, owner of the subsoil, which is embodied within the limits of the granted exploitation concession (consequence of Articles 2, 10 and 103 of the Constitution).*\n\n*[22] The Salvadoran Constitution and the Mining Law recognize and safeguard the rights of the owners of surface land. The Law grants the owner of surface land the right to be compensated for damages caused by exploration activities and, consequently, by exploitation activities (Article 21), a circumstance extending throughout the entire Law.*\n\n*[23] Requesting the permission of the owner of the soil (surface land) to conduct exploration or exploitation on the surface (when applicable, as we will see below) is logical, due to the rights given to landowners. On the other hand, it would be illogical to request the surface owner's permission when the exploitation does not affect the surface land and will be done in the subsoil, which is not the landowner's property and over which the has no in rem or personal rights whatsoever.*\n\n*[24] Accepting that the surface owner must grant permission to do work in the subsoil when the work is not done on the owner's surface land would mean affording the landowner the ownership of things outside commerce (rex extra comercii) because these are goods owned by the State, pursuant to the express provisions contained in the Salvadoran Constitution and the Mining Law.*\n\n*Section V. Interpretation on Permissions*\n\n*[25] The above notwithstanding, it should be noted that if we continue to read the articles of the Mining Law, the complete interpretation of the meaning of the requirement in Article 37 No. 2 b) is derived after reading Chapter VIII of the Law.*\n\n*[26] That chapter presents us with a different view with respect to whether or not the requirement is actually applicable for metallic mineral deposits.*\n\n*[27] The requirement is unquestionably applicable to Quarries, but for Mines, it is only applicable in exceptional cases, and we believe that it would only be applicable in the event that voluntary easements have been arranged with the surface landowners during the exploration phase. Why is this?*\n\n*[28] Under the whole system of easements established in Chapter VIII, along with authorizing the holders of mining Licenses or Concessions to arrange the voluntary easements they deem suitable with the owners or occupants of the land, the law establishes for the benefit of such Holders the legal easements for occupation, transit or passage, drainage, ventilation, transmission or electricity or any other that directly benefits or is required by the mining activity. Those easements, defined in the respective articles, are sufficient in and of themselves for conducting exploitation activities in all their complexity. The law has established an encumbrance on the properties included in the mining area and the owners cannot challenge this, to the degree that the Holder can petition the courts to set the amount of the compensation, as the encumbrance exists by the sovereign will expressed in the body of law in question.*\n\n*[29] Therefore, if the State has established an encumbrance on the mining areas, it is counterproductive to think that it is necessary to obtain the landowners' permission as a requirement for entering into the exploitation phase.*\n\n*[30] Therefore, what does the requirement established in No. 2 b) refer to in the case of Mines?*\n\n*[31] The only possible interpretation is that it refers to voluntary easements, which require an agreement with the owner. In fact, if voluntary easements were arranged during the exploration phase and are needed for continuing on to the exploitation stage, such permissions must be attached to the application. Otherwise, permission is not necessary.*\n\n*Section VI. Conclusions:*\n\n*[32] As we can see, in the case of mines, the practical effect of the requirement in Article 37, No. 2 b) is quite limited and it is more relevant for Quarries.*\n\n*[33] It is clear that the State has complete control over the mineral deposits within the mining activities, in turn safeguarding the rights of the surface landowners through compensation mechanisms, if the owners were to be impacted.*\n\n*[34] The landowner's rights cannot supersede the rights of the State; therefore, making a different interpretation would precisely ignore the obvious meaning of the Constitution and the Mining Law determined by consulting their spirit or resorting by analogy to any other legal interpretation with a different approach to observance of the law.*\n\n*[35] One of the rules of legal interpretation is that no interpretation can lead us to the absurd, and it would be absurd to require the permission of a third party unrelated to the ownership of the property where the work requiring permission will be carried out. Moreover, it would be absurd to give preference to the landowner's rights when the State has already regulated the scope of these rights.*\n\n*[36] In practice, the predominance of the State's rights over metallic mineral deposits materializes through the granting of the Concession itself.*\n\n*[37] When the State defines the area for exploitation, it must establish the concession applicant's right to enjoy legal easements (Article 54), and make certain to order the mechanisms deemed necessary to guarantee the concession holder's responsibility to compensate the owners of the soil.\"*\n\nShrake 2 WS, para. 110; R-30; R-31.\n\n6.32.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this memorandum was clearly stated and powerfully argued as regards the limited scope of the requirement imposed on PRES under Section 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. First, from a textual analysis of the Mining Law, the required authorization or ownership was effectively confined to quarries and, as regards underground mining, to those surface areas occupied by the mine's above-ground facilities. Second, from a teleological perspective, the same interpretation followed so as to avoid 'absurdities' as regards the surface of areas unaffected by underground mining. Third, an owner or occupier of surface land suffering legal injury caused by a concessionaire's underground mining activities had a remedy for compensation under Article 21 of the Mining Law. Lastly, the issue of legal and voluntary easements was introduced, by references to Articles 53 and 54 of the Mining Law. Given that title to sub-surface mineral deposits was held by the State (under Article 103(3) of the Constitution and Article 2(1) of the Mining Law); and it was only the State that granted a concession to an applicant for underground mining, legal easements would ensure that exploitation activities could be conducted \"in all their complexity\", without the necessity for authorization from surface owners (subject always to the payment of compensation in the event of legal injury).\n\n6.33.\n\nAll this meant, according to Mr Luis Medina's legal opinion and contrary to Ms Navas' stated position, that PRES was *not* required to submit any further authorization or ownership documentation in support of its pending application for an exploitation concession. In Mr Medina's view, the Bureau's interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) was \"illogical\" and \"absurd.\" At this point, therefore, these different views lay at opposite incompatible extremes.\n\n6.34.\n\nOn 25 May 2005, by a written memorandum, Ms Navas requested a legal opinion from the Legal Counsel to the Ministry of Economy, Dr Marta Ang\u00e9lica M\u00e9ndez.155 Her memorandum read, in material part, as follows:\n\n\"I am hereby making a special request for your written opinion with respect to the following matter: We are processing an application for a minerals concession in the municipality of San Isidro, Caba\u00f1as. The company will do a type of underground mining and says that for underground work it does not need to furnish proof of the availability of the property corresponding to the surface area that will be covered by the concession. The company is owner of the surface area where the plant will be installed, but not the rest of the area, and they believe that it is impossible to obtain all the permissions because there are many owners. This Bureau has explained to the company that, according to Article 37 of the Mining Law, the requirement in paragraph b) for an EXPLOITATION CONCESSION FOR MINES AND QUARRIES states that the following must be submitted: 'b) Deed to the property or legally granted authorization from the owner.' The company's argument is that they will be mining the subsoil and the subsoil belongs to the State; and if they request permission from the landowners, it would amount to saying that the owners of the surface land are also owners of the subsoil. The company's attorney has sent an interpretation of the Law, according to which we should not require such permissions. I attach the interpretation sent by the lawyer Luis Alonso Medina, representative of the company.\"\n\nThe attached \"interpretation\" was the memorandum, cited above, prepared by Mr Luis Medina for PRES. The Tribunal notes Ms Navas' contemporary reference to PRES' belief that it was \"impossible\" to obtain all the permissions of the full surface area of the requested concession \"because there are many owners.\" This information can only have come to her from Mr Earnest, as also described in her testimony below.\n\nR-31.\n\n6.35.\n\nOn 31 May 2005, pursuant to the request from Ms Navas, Dr Marta Ang\u00e9lica M\u00e9ndez, as Legal Secretary to the Ministry, advised Ms Navas as the Director of the Bureau on the interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.156 Whilst Ms Navas is not a lawyer, Dr M\u00e9ndez had been responsible within the Ministry (as a legal adviser) for preparing the Mining Law in 1995, together with the Bureau (which at that time already included Ms Navas).157\n\nR-32.\n\nNavas WS, para. 7.\n\n6.36.\n\nDr M\u00e9ndez' legal opinion reads, in material part, as follows:\n\n*\"[1]. Article 103 paragraph three of the Constitution establishes that the subsoil belongs to the State, which may grant exploitation concessions. This mandate has been further regulated in the Mining Law.*\n\n*[2]. The Mining Law establishes the provisions and conditions that must be met in order to obtain such concessions. Thus, Article 3 stipulates that the State may grant Licenses or Concessions for the exploration and exploitation of mines and quarries provided that the applicant complies with the provisions of the Mining Law and its Regulations. This is reiterated by Article 8, when it establishes that in order to obtain mining rights, the person must be capable and suitable, and provided such person complies with the rules established by the Law and the Regulations [emphasis in original].*\n\n*[3]. Among these provisions that must be met is Article 37 No. 2 (b), which stipulates that the party interested in obtaining a mining exploitation concession is under an obligation to submit the Property Deed for the property or legally granted authorization from the owner.*\n\n*[4]. With regard to making use of land belonging to others, in addition to establishing the above provision for exploitation concessions, the Mining Law establishes the same for exploration in Article 21, for quarries in Article 30 paragraph three, and for arranging voluntary easements in Articles 53 and 56. In other words, the law requires that one be the property owner or have the owner's authorization for both underground and aboveground mining operations.*\n\n*[5]. The Constitution recognizes the right to own property in Articles 2, 11 and 103. Moreover, Article 2 establishes the right to security and the right to be protected in the preservation and defense of those rights. Due to their very nature, mining operations pose dangers that may have an impact on peoples' lives, health or assets.*\n\n*[6]. Since the subsoil belongs to the State according to the Constitution and the Mining Law, concessions for exploitation can be granted to both the owners of the property where the deposits are found or to third parties, provided they furnish evidence that they are the owner or have been authorized by the owner by means of the corresponding public document. In this regard, the Bureau of Hydrocarbons and Mines must require applicants to submit this document and all others required by law so that, once the process indicated in the law is concluded, the Bureau may send the proceedings to the Ministry for the purpose of having it issue the corresponding Concession Resolution.*\n\n*[7]. From the moment that the Constitution establishes that a concession is required for underground mining, the secondary law regulating a certain type of concession - in this case for mines and quarries - must bear in mind respect for people's fundamental rights, such as the right to own property and the right to security. Therefore, the fact that the subsoil belongs to the State does not mean that the State will permit excavation under private property without the owner's authorization.*\n\n*[8]. Finally, it should be pointed out that, according to case law from the Constitutional Court, the right to security set forth in Article 2 of the Constitution has two dimensions: material security and legal certainty. In the material dimension, this means the right to peace of mind, i.e. the right of each individual to enjoy the property that he or she owns without risks, disturbance or fears, or the peace of mind that the State will take the appropriate preventive measures to ensure that owners suffer no damage or disruption.*\n\n*Consequently, whoever wishes to exploit non-renewable natural resources in the subsoil must obtain the respective concession after complying with the provisions of the Constitution and the Mining Law, including Article 37, No. (2 b) of the latter; and the interpretation contained in the attached document [a reference to Mr Medina's memorandum] is not consistent with what the primary law and the Mining Law provide. Moreover, if the Bureau of Hydrocarbons or the Minister of Economy were to proceed as described in that document, they would be violating the Principle of Legality also established by the Constitution....\"*\n\n6.37.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this second legal opinion is equally clear and well-argued as regards three significant factors regarding the legal interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. First, the statutory requirement as to ownership or authorization applied to the whole surface area of the requested concession and not merely to that part of its surface area 'directly impacted' by the requested concession; second, that requirement applied to a concession for underground mining (such as PRES' application) and not merely to quarries or open-pit mining; and third, the Ministry of Economy could not lawfully process PRES' application unless PRES had first satisfied the statutory requirement imposed by Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. The Tribunal also notes the references to \"material security\" and the dangers posed by mining \"that may have an impact on peoples' lives, health or assets.\" This second legal opinion clearly supported the Bureau's legal interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law; but the Ministry of Economy did not stop there.\n\n6.38.\n\n*June 2005:* On 20 June 2005, pursuant to a request from the Minister of the Economy (Ms Yolanda de Gavidia) dated 25 May 2005 (enclosing a copy of Mr Medina's memorandum cited above),158 Dr Luis Mario Rodr\u00edguez R. (the Secretary for Legislative and Legal Affairs in the Office of the President), sent to the Minister (who was not a lawyer) the Secretariat's legal opinion, in writing, on the interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.159\n\nR-30.\n\nR-32.\n\n6.39.\n\nIn his covering letter, Dr Rodr\u00edguez' confirmed to the Minister of Industry: \"The analysis concludes that for these applications for Mining Concessions, the Ministry of Economy must require the applicants to submit documents proving ownership of the land on the surface, which must be defined in the official document granting the concession, and in the event that the applicant is not the owner, the Ministry should require the documents proving the consent of the third parties who are the owners.\"\n\n6.40.\n\nThe Secretariat's enclosed legal opinion merits citation at length. It reads, in material part, as follows (with footnotes here omitted and paragraph numbers marked thus [...] added here for ease of reference):160\n\n*\"[1] Pursuant to Article 13 of the Mining Law, exploitation concessions for mines and quarries will be granted by Resolution of the Ministry of Economy [Footnote 1]. This provision is supplemented by the content of Article 23 paragraph one of the Law, which states that this resolution shall precede the signing of a contract [Footnote 2].*\n\n*[2] In order to reach a conclusion on the requirements to be met by the applicants for this type of concession, we will study several provisions of the law in question that apply starting with the exploration license that precedes the concession per se.*\n\n*[3] When dealing with the scope of the exploration license - prior to the concession - the legislature has determined that it '(...) grants the Holder the exclusive power to conduct mining activities to locate the deposits of the mineral substances for which it has been granted, within the limits of the area conferred and indefinitely in d epth. [emphasis in the original]. It also grants the exclusive right to request the respective concession' (Article 19, paragraph 1).*\n\n*[4] From this provision, it is deduced that the official document granting the exploration license must contain a definition of the limits of the area in which the mining exploration activities will be conducted. Such limits refer to the surface area because, in depth, there is no limit to be defined by the authority, as seen from this provision.*\n\n*[5] In relation to this same issue, Article 21 paragraph 1 states that 'If the exploration area includes land owned by others and the work is to be done on the surface of the land, permission from the owner shall be necessary, and obtaining it is the license holder's responsibility.'*\n\n*[6] In view of the fact that the official document granting the exploration license must make reference to surface limits, it is essential to have the consent of the owners of such surface area, be it the applicant for [the] license itself or the respective third parties. Otherwise, the Government would not have the power to authorize exploration within those surface limits.*\n\n*[7] Once exploration has concluded, the interested party must proceed to apply for the respective concession, and in the act that confers it, the competent authority must also make reference to the surface limits: 'Article 24 paragraph 1. - \"The mining Concession grants the Holder the right to extract the previously determined minerals that are found inside a solid of indefinite depth limited by vertical planes corresponding to the sides of a polygon, whose corners are referenced to the coordinates of the Lambert conformal conic projection, or UTM, oriented North-South, East-West, international or coastal limits, which must also be included in the area indicated in the Exploration License, and its surface area shall be granted based on the size of the deposit(s) and the holder's technical justifications' [emphasis in the original].*\n\n*[8] In addition, in the act granting the concession, it is essential to define the surface limits, and to do so, the consent of the owners of the land included in such surface limits is required. If consent is not obtained from the third parties, the State could proceed to expropriate the land if it so deemed necessary [Footnote 3].*\n\n*[9] The position taken here is supported by the fact that the legislature required the competent authority to order the surveying and demarcation of the limits of the area covered by the application: 'Article 42: Once the decision declaring the objection inadmissible is final and conclusive, or if no objection has been filed, and once the fifteen days after final publication mentioned in the first paragraph of the preceding article have elapsed, the Bureau shall order the surveying and demarcation of the limits of the area covered by the application, which shall be completed within a term of up to sixty days [emphasis in the original]. The posts used for demarcation shall be solidly built. If they cannot be built due to adversities of the terrain, additional posts shall be fixed in visible parts of the land, provided it is feasible to do so. Once said work has been finalized, the corresponding opinion shall be issued and the case file submitted to the Ministry of Economy, who shall proceed as established in the following article (....)' [Footnote 4].*\n\n*[10] For exploitation concessions for mines and quarries, when regulating the procedure for submitting applications and attached documents, the legislature has required that the following documents, among others, must be submitted: a) Site plan of the property in which the activities will take place, cartographic map of the area, topographical drawing and its respective technical description, size of the requested area irrefutably establishing its location, boundaries and name of the adjacent properties; b) Deed to the property or authorization legally granted by the owner;\" (Article 37, No. 2 a) and b)).*\n\n*[11] This Secretariat is of the opinion that, according to all the provisions cited above, when the word 'property' is used, it can only refer to the property of the surface area for which the concession will be granted.*\n\n*[12] To finish this analysis, it should be taken into account that license or concession holders are able to arrange voluntary easements with other landowners; and also enjoy legal easements, which include the easement for occupation [Footnote 5]. This easement 'authorizes the concessionaire to occupy the areas of land strictly needed for construction, equipment installation and all other work. This easement also includes the authority to build and maintain channels, tiers, excavations, accesses, galleries and all other mining works in their different modalities and extraction systems; as well as to establish fencing, signage and protection for the occupied areas' (Article 58).*\n\n*[13] Due to its nature, this occupation easement will encumber land not included in the surface area specified by the authority in the pertinent resolution.*\n\n*[14] With regard to the compensation for any damages and losses caused to third parties as a result of exercising the rights arising from the easements, the legislature has provided that this situation must be established in the document creating those in rem rights [Footnote 6].*\n\n*[15] It should be clarified that only the license or concession holders can come to enjoy the easements in question. Therefore, it cannot be thought that in order to grant exploitation concessions, the legislature requires applicants to submit documentation proving that the respective easements have been created as a requirement for granting the concession.*\n\n*[16] Thus, it cannot be concluded that when the law requires the applicant to submit a document proving the consent of the third party owners of the property (in Article 37, Nos. 2 a and b), this refers to the cases in which voluntary easements have been created, as maintained in the document attached to the request for an opinion from the Minister of Economy [This \"document\" was Mr Medina's memorandum].*\n\n*[17] General Conclusion: Based on all the above, we conclude that in the cases of applications for exploitation concessions, the Ministry of Economy must require that documents be submitted proving ownership of the land included on the surface, which must be defined in the official document granting the concess ion [emphasis in the original]. In the event that the applicant itself is not the owner, then the applicant must be required to submit the documents proving the consent of the third parties who are the owners.\"*\n\nR-33.\n\n6.41.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this third legal opinion by the Presidential Secretariat is also clear and well-argued as regards the three crucial issues on the legal interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. First, the statutory requirement as to ownership or authorization applies to the whole of the surface area of land comprising the requested concession; second, that requirement applies to both mines and quarries; and third, as confirmed by the covering letter from Dr Rodr\u00edguez, the Ministry of Economy could not process an application for an exploitation concession under the Mining Law unless the applicant has first satisfied the statutory requirement imposed by Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. In particular, the Tribunal notes the Secretariat's opinion that the word 'property' used in Article 37(2)(b) could only refer to the property of the surface area for which the concession would be granted by the Ministry of Economy; i.e. the whole of that surface area. This legal opinion clearly supported the position taken by the Bureau towards PRES, under Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.\n\n6.42.\n\nThe Ministry of the Economy (including the Bureau) recognised that this was a very important matter for PRES and the Claimant. As Ms Navas testified: \"This was an absolutely crucial point in making a determination on Pacific Rim's concession application, since the company had admitted that it was impossible for it to comply with this requirement, either at that time or in the future. On the one hand, there were several property owners within the requested concession area, and on the other, some of those owners did not wish to sell their land or give Pacific Rim permission to have a concession that would include the subsoil beneath their properties, or they asked for too much money.\"161\n\nNavas WS, para. 45.\n\n6.43.\n\n*June 2005:* On 28 June 2005, by a memorandum to Mr Shrake dated 28 June 2005 entitled \"Surface Owner Authorisation Issue\", Mr Earnest wrote as follows:162\n\n\"... On Friday, June 24 [2005], I met with Gina Navas [the Director of the Bureau], at her invitation, to discuss the matter of the surface owner authorizations. Gina informed me that the office of the Secretariat for Legislative and Judicial Affairs had reviewed the mining law and was in agreement with the interpretation of the Ministry of Economy and the Division of Mines. I asked for a copy of the opinion and was informed that it was an internal Ministry document and that their lawyer had advised that it not be shared. I indicated that this made it pretty difficult to seek any compromise and that it was akin to fighting against a ghost. We discussed the pros and cons of pushing for a formal declaration on this point and agreed that now is not the time. There are two main things that are lacking in our request for the exploitation concession at this time: the environmental permit and the authorization of the landowners. The environmental permit process is clearly out of our hands and the latter is a nearly (if not totally) impossible task. Pushing for a formal declaration would start a 30-day clock, requiring the presentation of the environmental permit and the authorizations [This was an implicit reference to Article 38 of the Mining Law]. Given that the Division of Mines is sympathetic to our status in regards to the environmental permit, this buys us time. Near the close of the meeting I asked what kind of authorization was required, suggesting something along the lines of I, John Doe, authorize the Republic of El Salvador to grant an exploitation concession to Pacific Rim El Salvador...'. This was immediately rejected with the argument that the government didn't need any authorization to grant the concession. Gina then indicated that it was an authorization for us to use the land, to which I replied that we already have all of the authorizations for the land that will be occupied by the project. She became very reflective (almost as though she was beginning to see the point), but offered no further suggestions.\"\n\nC-291.\n\n6.44.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, although the Ministry of Economy did not show either of the two legal opinions to him, Mr Earnest clearly understood the issue on the interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law, namely that PRES could comply with its requirement as to only a part of the surface area of the requested concession area and hence it could not comply with Article 37(2)(b), as interpreted by the Ministry of Economy and the Presidential Secretariat. Mr Shrake testified that the Claimant realized that it needed to push for a different interpretation.163 As the Claimant's counsel rightly acknowledged at the hearing, PRES \"was aware obviously of the surface rights, of what the Government's interpretation at that time was of the surface rights issue; and they [PRES and the Claimant] understood that the Government was pursuing different options for how they were going [to] approach this, either there was going to be an authentic interpretation that was going to be made [part] of the law or they were going to seek to amend the law.\"164\n\nTr. D2,343.\n\nTr. D7.1941-1942.\n\n6.45.\n\nWhat is also significant, notwithstanding the Ministry's interpretation (confirmed by the Presidential Secretariat), is the continued 'sympathetic' approach taken by the Bureau and the Ministry of Economy to PRES' application, as here noted by Mr Earnest. Notwithstanding Article 38 of the Mining Law and much welcomed by PRES, the Bureau was here seeking positively to assist PRES and the Claimant. That approach was shared by the Minister herself, subject (as always) to complying with the rule of law: Ms Yolanda de Gavidia testified: \"... it is true that I as well as other officials in the Salvadoran Government expressed our support to Pacific Rim of its project in El Salvador. However, that support necessarily had to be in framed [sic] within compliance with the laws of El Salvador. At no time was I willing to grant Pacific Rim, or any other company, a concession to which it was not entitled under the laws of El Salvador.\"165\n\nYolanda de Gavidia WS, para. 7.\n\n6.46.\n\nThe Tribunal also refers to Mr Earnest's statement regarding PRES's \"nearly (if not totally) impossible task\" in complying with the requirement of Article 37(2)(b), as interpreted by the Ministry. As explained by Ms Navas in her written testimony:166\n\n\"[38]. In particular, there was one requirement that Pacific Rim did not and could not meet, as they themselves admitted to us. This requirement was to show ownership of the entire surface area requested for the concession, or legal permission from the owners.\n\n[39]. Pacific Rim's representatives, both its local counsel as well as those in charge of the company in El Salvador, told us that certain property owners did not wish to sell, and those that had offered to sell wanted to sell for far too much.\n\n[40]. Faced with the impossibility of obtaining ownership over the entire surface area requested for the concession, Pacific Rim's representatives argued that the requirement should be interpreted differently for underground mines, being restricted in those cases to the surface areas where the concession holder would need to drill or perform work on the land's surface.\n\n[41]. However, my response was always that the Mining Law did not establish any difference between the requirements for open-pit mines and underground mines; consequently, the requirements for both types of mines were the same, and therefore Pacific Rim needed to comply with them. Technical specialists within the Bureau provided that same response to Pacific Rim.\n\n[42]. As a result, what Pacific Rim asserts - that we in the Ministry of Economy or in the Bureau of Hydrocarbons and Mines had doubts about whether confirmation of ownership or legal permission from the owners for the entire area requested for the concession in the case of underground mining was necessary -is untrue. No one in the Bureau of Hydrocarbons and Mines had any doubt as to this requirement because the Mining Law is clear in this regard.\"\n\nNavas WS, paras. 39-42.\n\n6.47.\n\nMr William Gehlen (of PRES) testified that PRES' predicament was a \"pragmatic difficulty\" caused by the large number of landowners in the area of the requested concession. Mr Gehlen worked as geologist for the Claimant and its companies from March 1997 to December 2012 in various senior capacities. In his witness statement, he disputed Ms Navas' testimony, as follows [with footnotes here omitted]:167\n\n\"[190].... there are hundreds (actually more than a thousand by my estimate) people with surface rights of some kind within the concession area. Many of them do not have their lands registered, and many cannot read or write. We were therefore unwilling to go through the process of obtaining 'authorization' from all of these people without knowing exactly what it was that we were hoping to achieve through this process. Contrary to what Ms Navas is indicating in her witness statement in this arbitration, it was never 'understood' what form the 'authorization' should take. If this was 'understood', it was understood only by Ms Navas. I am certainly not aware that it was communicated to the company or to anyone else that would have communicated it to us.\n\n[191]. Since Pac Rim itself never tried to obtain these 'authorizations', I do not know how Ms Navas could say that the landowners 'did not wish to. give Pacific Rim permission to have a concession', or that they 'asked for too much money'. I seriously doubt that Ms Navas ever spoke to all (or even most) of the people living in the concession area, much less asked them whether they would give Pac Rim 'permission', or how much money they would ask for to do so.\n\n[192]. In light of Ms Navas' statements about this issue, I would just like to clarify that, from Pac Rim's perspective, the difficulty in obtaining 'authorization' from the surface landowners in the area of the requested concession was largely a pragmatic difficulty relating to the issues I have identified above: namely, the fact that there are many people occupying these lands; many of the properties are not properly registered (which also makes the occupants reluctant to reveal their identities or sign formal documents); and many of them cannot read or write, which also significantly complicates the process of obtaining written agreements. For these reasons, Pac Rim's ordinary practice with regard to exploration activities was to use very simple documents to record the landowners' agreement and/or their receipt of payment from the company for damages to their land. This was the same practice that had been followed by Kinross for many years prior to our investment.\n\n[193]. I would note that Pac Rim has never had any difficulties in obtaining permission from landowners to carry out surface works on the area of the requested concession, including sampling, trenching, construction of drill pads and access roads, and drilling. Over the years, we have worked on pretty much all corners of this area and have never faced opposition from the landowners. Occasionally, a landowner will ask us to wait to construct a certain drill pad until the corn has been harvested on a particular plot of land (which, of course, we do). That is about the biggest 'issue' we have ever really faced in dealing with these surface owners.\"\n\nGehlen WS, paras. 190-193.\n\n6.48.\n\nAs regards Mr Gehlen's testimony in the passage cited from paragraph [190] above, it will be recalled that Ms Navas' information regarding PRES' difficulties in procuring consents from surface owners and occupiers at El Dorado had come from Mr Earnest, not Mr Gehlen. (As already indicated, Mr Earnest was not called as witness in this arbitration by the Claimant).\n\n6.49.\n\n*August 2005:* In his El Dorado Project Report of 31 August 2005,168 Mr Earnest of PRES reported to the Claimant that the Bureau, at the time that the new documents were presented for DOREX's applications regarding Guaco, Pueblos and Huacuco on 26 August 2005, had requested from PRES (*inter alia*) \"certified copies of the documents that demonstrate ownership of the surface property in the area of the old El Dorado mine.\" Mr Earnest added: \"... In the matter of the interpretation of the law regarding the need to obtain the authorization of the surface owners, the 'Ministra de Econom\u00eda' has acknowledged that something needs to be done. Meetings have been held with political consultants to determine the best course of action should it become necessary to seek an authentic interpretation or a change in the law. It is hoped that a course of action will be clear after the meetings to [be] held during Tom Shrake's visit in September [2005].\" This \"request\" by the Bureau by reference to Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law was informal and amicable, outwith Article 38 of the Mining Law; and, as such, it was not unwelcome to the Claimant and PRES: something clearly did need \"to be done.\"\n\nC-288.\n\n6.50.\n\n*September 2005:* On 13 September 2005, on behalf of the Minister of the Economy, Ms Navas (of the Bureau) requested an \"urgent\" legal opinion from the Ministry's lawyer, Mr Eli Valle, on proposed legislative changes to the Mining Law. These were cast as proposed amendments to the Mining Law, as distinct from the interpretation of the existing provisions of the Mining Law, with the main purpose of not requiring land authorizations for underground exploitation but \"only from those who will be affected on the surface.\"169 Ms Yolanda de Gavidia testified that (as the Minister of the Economy) she had asked Ms Navas \"to present a proposal for the amendment of the law so that we could support the investor, do what they said it was impossible to do.\"170\n\nR-35.\n\nTr. D3,646.\n\n6.51.\n\nThese proposed changes included three provisions limiting the scope of Article 37(2)(b), accommodating PRES: First, \"1. [re Article 24]. In the case of underground mines, the applicant must only show the legal availability of the property or properties where the necessary infrastructure will be installed for operation of the mine, mineral processing and disposal of mining waste, but not for the area corresponding to the deposit or deposits to be exploited.\" Second, as regards documentation required of an applicant for a concession: \"2(4)(h). [re Article 37(2)(b)] For underground mines, the deed of title to the property or authorization legally issued by the owner of the areas where the necessary infrastructure will be located for operation of the mine, for mineral processing and disposal of mining waste, but not for the area corresponding to the deposit or deposits to be exploited.\" Third, the \"transitory provision\": \"The persons who upon entry into force of these amendments, have submitted Concession applications for the exploitation of open-pit and underground mines, for which a final determination has not yet been made, shall be subject to the above amendments to this Law.\"171\n\nR-35.\n\n6.52.\n\nOn 20 September 2005, by email message of that date entitled \"Re: Authentic Interpretation\", Mr Luis Medina (as PRES' lawyer) wrote to Mr Ricardo Suarez (of the Presidential Office), as follows: \"Following up on last week's meeting with the vicepresident's office, I'm enclosing a draft of the kind of authentic interpretation that we need for the mining project to move forward...\" This draft took the form of a decree to be made by the Legislative Assembly, in the form of an \"authentic interpretation\" of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.\n\n6.53.\n\nThe attached draft decree prepared by Mr Medina read, in part, as follows: \"Section 1 -[Article] 37(2)(b) [of the Mining Law] shall be authentically interpreted, meaning that in the case of metallic mineral exploitation, authorization must be acquired from the owners of those properties located inside the projected concession area and/or where the work to be carried out is at the soil surface; therefore, it will not be necessary to acquire permission from owners whose surface rights are not being affected, even when these lands are located inside the projected exploitation area. In non-metallic mineral exploitation, the property where it is to be carried out must in all cases be owned by the person making the application, or legal authorization from the landowner or possessor must be acquired.\"\n\n6.54.\n\nOn 23 September 2005, Mr Suarez (of the Presidential Office) replied by email message to Mr Medina (again, as PRES' lawyer):172\n\n\"We share your opinion that the legal requirement that surface landowners authorize subsurface mining is not consistent with the ownership practice enshrined in our legal system, since according to the latter the owner of the subsoil is the State. In any case, surface landowners' rights are protected, if damages occur, the party carrying out building work would be obligated to repair them or provide compensation.\n\nHowever, that is the current legal text, and the one that must be observed.\n\nRegarding how to reconcile that text with State ownership, and specifically as relates to the 'authentic interpretation' proposal that you have prepared [see the draft cited above], it appears to us that in contrasting the current text of [Article] 37 with the text of the proposed interpretation, rather than clarifying an opaque passage of the law, you would be changing its meaning, assigning a different scope - although logical and desirable - to the text. This would mean that rather than an interpretation, we are dealing with a *reform* of the text under the guise of an interpretation, something allowed for neither in our legal system, nor in the doctrine that inspires it [emphasis in the original].\n\nTherefore, although we share your view regarding the problems posed by the current wording of [Article] 37 and the advisability of making it consistent with the Constitution after analyzing the text of the proposed interpretation, we do not believe that the proposed authentic interpretation is the correct legal approach. Please let us know how we can be of further assistance.\"\n\nC-289.\n\n6.55.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this response from the Presidential Secretariat was broadly sympathetic to the PRES' predicament. However, Mr Suarez did not agree with PRES' suggestion as to how that predicament could be resolved: it needed a substantive reform to the Mining Law with a true amendment, rather than an \"authentic interpretation\" of an existing provision decreed by the Legislative Assembly. Without such a statutory reform, the current legal text, contrary to PRES' suggested interpretation, was the one that \"must be observed\", as unequivocally stated by Mr Suarez. There could have been at the time no misunderstanding by Mr Medina as to this statement; and, in the circumstances, that understanding is attributable to the PRES and the Claimant. Indeed, even without this statement, the Tribunal considers that any contrary understanding could not reasonably have been held by either of them.\n\n6.56.\n\nIn fact, Mr Shrake testified that this was also his understanding: \"... I'm really not a lawyer. I can tell you that my understanding at this time was the same - we were working with the Government of El Salvador hand to hand. Our understandings were basically the same. They understood that there was a problem in the law, that the law did not address underground mines when they stipulated the requirement for permissions to access the surface, so, we had various communications with various people. One of the solutions was to reform the Mining Law... The relationship was always interactive and transparent and very supportive on both sides.\"173\n\nTr. D2,348-349.\n\n6.57.\n\nOn 28 September and 29 September 2005, the Bureau granted exploration licences to DOREX (the Claimant's subsidiary) pursuant to its applications made on 25 August 2005 for Guaco, Pueblos and Huacuco.174 (These are addressed in Part IX below, as already indicated). Whatever the legal effect of these three licences under the Mining Law, their grant to DOREX at this time can only be understood as further active support by the Bureau and the Ministry of Economy for the Claimant and PRES in regard to PRES' application for an exploitation concession at El Dorado.\n\nC-43; C-44; C-45.\n\n6.58.\n\n*October 2005:* By letter dated 6 October 2005, Mr Rodriguez (the Secretary for Legislative and Legal Affairs in the Presidential office) wrote to the Minister of the Economy (Ms Yolanda de Gavidia), commenting adversely on the suggestion that Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law should be clarified with an \"authentic interpretation.\" This suggestion had come from the Ministry, as testified by Ms Yolanda de Gavidia.175 The Secretary's letter concluded: \"3. In any event, we would have serious doubts about the constitutionality of the authentic interpretation: A - Would this be an authentic interpretation, or is it essentially a true amendment? We believe that in reality, it is the latter, in which case it would be unconstitutional, being an amendment intended to have retroactive effect. B -The content, even if done as an amendment, would affect property rights without having allowed the participation of the affected surface land owners.\"176\n\nTr. D3,654.\n\nR-34.\n\n6.59.\n\nOn 18 October 2005, there was an exchange of emails between Mr Earnest (of PRES) and PROESA, the Respondent's Agency for the Promotion of Exportation and Investment.177 Mr Earnest had inquired as to the status of the proposed change to the Mining Law. PROESA's legal adviser responded: \"... the Minister of Economy has referred the matter to the Legal Department in the Office of the President, where the pertinent analyses are being made about what would be the best way to bring out change in the law, either by reform or by proper [authentic] interpretation thereof.\"\n\nC-292.\n\n6.60.\n\nAt about this time, the Presidential Secretariat, with the Ministry of Economy, decided upon a proposed legislative amendment to the requirement of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law, along with other amendments. There was to be no further attempt to procure any \"authentic interpretation.\"\n\n6.61.\n\nOn 24 October 2005, the Bureau sent by fax to PRES the text of a draft decree, amending the Mining Law.178 There was to be, *inter alia,* a new Article 24 amending Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. Entitled \"Designation of the Area to be Exploited\", the draft amendment read as follows:\n\n\"24 The Mining Concession grants the holder the right to exploit the previously determined minerals that are found within a solid substance of indefinite depth limited by vertical planes that correspond to the sides of a polygon, of which the vertices coincide with the coordinates of the Lambert conformal conic projection, or the UTM, oriented North-South, East-West, with international or coastal limits; and which must also be situated within the designated area of the Exploration License, and its surface will be granted in accordance with the magnitude of the deposits and the technical justification of the rights holder.\n\nWhen an underground mine is in question, the applicant must demonstrate title of ownership, or legal authorization granted by the owner of the property or properties upon which all of the infrastructure necessary for the development of the mine will be installed. This includes the mineral processing plant and the location of mineral wastes. Additionally, the necessary easement rights must also be verified.\n\nWhen an open-pit mine is in question, the requirements established in the previous subsection must be fulfilled, and proof of ownership or of legal authorization granted by the owner of the property or properties to be exploited must be submitted...\"\n\nC-406.\n\n6.62.\n\nIt is clear that the second paragraph of this draft Article 24, addressing underground mines (to be distinguished from open-pit mines in the third paragraph) was calculated to assist PRES in regard to the existing requirement of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law, as interpreted by the Bureau and the Ministry of Economy.\n\n6.63.\n\nOn 25 October 2005, the Claimant (with PRES) examined these proposed legislative amendments to the Mining Law. By email message dated 25 October 2005 to Mr Shrake (with others), these proposed changes were described by Mr Earnest (of PRES), *inter alia*, as follows:179\n\n\"... Yesterday afternoon I received a copy of the document that will be presented to the legislature for approval. The following is a summary of the changes.\n\nArticle 24 - clarifies that for underground operations, the company must be the owner or have legal authorization for the use of the land where surface installations are to be constructed. Furthermore [it] states that in the case of open pit mines, the company must be [the] owner or have legal authorization for the use of the land to be disturbed by mining activities...\n\nOur analysis (Luis Medina and I) is as follows: *Article 24 is exactly what we need*. [emphasis supplied]\n\n... We are trying to get a meeting with the Minister of Economy to discuss these issues.\"\n\nC-400.\n\n6.64.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this draft legislation amending Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law, as proposed by the Ministry, speaks for itself. The Ministry was acting in support of PRES; it was seeking, by a legislative amendment to the Mining Law, a new substantive distinction between underground mining and open-pit mines (akin to quarries); and, for the former, the proposed amended requirement for 'ownership' and 'authorizations' would be limited to the surface area \"where [surface] installations are to be constructed.\" The Ministry's proposal did not mean that it now agreed with PRES' interpretation of the current law. To the contrary, because the Ministry proposed an amendment to the existing law, the need for such a substantive change was consistent only with its own interpretation (adverse to that previously advanced by PRES), as also supported by the Respondent's two legal opinions of May and June 2005. However, to this extent, the Ministry of Economy (including the Bureau) and the Claimant (with PRES) were now working together towards a common objective of an appropriate legislative amendment to, *inter alia,* Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. As Mr Shrake testified: \"The reality is that Pac Rim's participation in mining law reform efforts in El Salvador was undertaken upon the suggestions of or in collaboration with the Government.\"180\n\nShrake 3 WS, para. 31.\n\n6.65.\n\n*November 2005* : By email dated 3 November 2005, Mr Earnest (of PRES) reported to Ms Lorena Aceto (of PROESA):181 \"Luis Medina and I have reviewed the proposed reform to the mining law. We have met with Gina Navas de Hern\u00e1ndez and proposed some very minor changes to clarify one of the concepts of the reform. She agreed to pass the proposed modifications on to the office of the Secretariat Tecnica. Is there any way of following up on the document to see if the suggestions were accepted?\"\n\nC-294.\n\n6.66.\n\nAt this point, by late 2005, PRES had potentially a legal remedy readily at hand under Article 7 of the Mining Regulations. For several months, since March 2005, there had existed an incompatible difference between PRES and the Bureau regarding the correct legal interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law; that difference had crystallised with the parties' respective legal opinions; the Bureau, supported by the Ministry and the Presidential Secretariat, was standing firm behind its legal interpretation of the statutory requirement regarding authorizations and ownership of surface land; and that interpretation alone (even disregarding all other current difficulties facing PRES) was sufficient to thwart PRES' application for an exploitation concession at El Dorado, now almost 12 months old. As Mr Earnest had implicitly informed Mr Shrake in his email message of 28 June 2005, PRES could have triggered proceedings against the Bureau and the Ministry of Economy so as conclusively to resolve their difference of legal interpretation. PRES still did not so. PRES had chosen, with the Claimant, to pursue a different solution. There would doubtless have been, of course, good reasons to do so; but it was their choice. Rather than pursue their own benign interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law by litigation in El Salvador, the Claimant and PRES had committed themselves to securing a legislative amendment to Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law, actively supported by the Bureau and the Ministry of Economy. Henceforth, the Salvadoran litigation route seems not to have been considered by the Claimant and PRES, on the evidence adduced before this Tribunal.\n\n***F. 2006***\n-------------\n\n6.67.\n\nEventually, as recited below, these proposed amendments to the Mining Law, including Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining law, were not to be enacted by the Legislative Assembly in 2006. That failure was not attributable to a decision by the Ministry of Economy (or the Bureau). As Ms Yolanda de Gavidia explained in her testimony: \"We, at the Ministry, had the initiative, but we could not assure the investor that the reform was going to take place because this was in the hands of the legislative branch of Government [\u2026].\"182 Under the Constitution, the Ministry of Economy, as part of the Respondent's executive branch, could not amend the Mining Law by itself: that constitutional power was reserved to the Legislative Assembly, as the Claimant and PRES understood.\n\nTr. D3,679.\n\n6.68.\n\n*February 2006:* In the meantime, by email message dated 15 February 2006 to Mr Shrake,183 Mr Earnest (of PRES) passed on the written report of a meeting held by a professional colleague with the Minister of Economy (Ms Yolanda de Gavidia) on the project to reform the Mining Law. He wrote: \"... This is really good news.\" In the English translation of the report, his message reads: \"... she [the Minister] confirmed that it is the President's instructions to present the project after March 12th [2006] for reasons of electoral strategy, to not stir up opposition to the reform project. She said that today (Tuesday) [i.e. 14 February 2006] she would be visiting the President to jointly sign and have the initiative ready. The documents have now been signed and are ready to be presented on the indicated date. This demonstrates that there is no opposition on the part of the Government and the auxiliary organisations. Based on this, we have sought and obtained the commitment of support for the project from the PCN (one of the moderate parties - their vote along with ARENA will ensure the reform passes). With a great deal of satisfaction, I can inform you that we are ready in the legislative arena, which confirms our perception that the resistance was more than anything electoral concerns...\"\n\nC-295.\n\n6.69.\n\n*March 2006* : Legislative elections to the Legislative Assembly took place in El Salvador on 12 March 2006.\n\n6.70.\n\n*May 2006:* In May 2006,184 the Claimant prepared power point slides for an internal meeting. The third slide marked \"Legal\" reads as follows: \"\\* Conversion of Exploration License to Exploitation Concession - pending environmental permit & change of mining law (Plan A) or \"authorization\" of surface land owners (Plan B). \\* Cadastral Survey of surface properties overlying the underground operations and properties affected by surface installations has been ordered.\" The fourth slide reads: \"Lease w/option to purchase was renewed with [TM] in April [2006] (12 months). \\* Negotiations with [A] in La Trinidad have been delayed by fallout from the incident in the community and subsequent threats.\" The first of these properties had been one of the six properties to be directly affected by PRES' requested concession, which had been identified in PRES' application of 22 December 2004 as having not been purchased by PRES, but leased with an option to buy.185 The second property was not expressly identified in PRES' application.\n\nC-711.\n\nR-2, para. 4.2.\n\n6.71.\n\nTo distinguish henceforth between the two solutions proposed by the Claimant and PRES, the Tribunal has here adopted the Claimant's same shorthand, \"Plan A\" denoting a material legislative amendment to Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law and \"Plan B\" denoting the ownership or authorization by PRES of the full surface area required by the existing (unamended) Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining law, as interpreted by the Bureau and Ministry of Economy. The Claimant and PRES were not considering a third option; namely: to shrink the size of the requested concession to the lesser area for which PRES had submitted the documentation required by Article 37(2)(b).186 That option would have been a drastic solution; and it would have required an amended application by PRES to the Bureau. For reasons not entirely clear from the evidence, it was not pursued by PRES. In any event, as Mr Shrake testified, Plan A was \"the preferred option, I think, for everybody involved.\"187 Again, that was a decision made by the Claimant and PRES: it was not a decision made or procured by the Ministry of Economy or the Bureau, still less imposed on the Claimant or PRES.\n\nTr. D2,350, 353 & 368.\n\nTr. D2,369.\n\n6.72.\n\nAs at May 2006, neither Plan A nor Plan B was in effect. Hence, as the existing law stood, with the Respondent's interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law (if correct), PRES' application of 22 December 2004 was non-compliant. It had been non-compliant for 17 months, far exceeding any 30-day deadline under Article 38 of the Mining Law.\n\n6.73.\n\n*June 2006* : Mr Shrake testified that, at about this time, \"... we were unsure whether any reform of the mining law would even be necessary to resolve the surface rights issue, but we nevertheless proposed to the Minister of Economy and to the Vice-President that the mining law be reformed for the express purpose of strengthening the relevant environmental protections.\"188 This took place at a meeting between, *inter alios*, the VicePresident, Ms Yolanda de Gavidia, Mr Suarez, Mr Shrake and Ms McLeod-Seltzer.189 In PRES' weekly summary for the El Dorado Project for the week ending 2 June 2006,190 it was reported in regard to this meeting: \"... The Vice-President indicated that the Government understands the importance of the project and is pleased with the strength that the Pacific Rim team brings to the country. Tom [Shrake] proposed that the mining law need[s] to be improved to provide stronger environmental requirements. A task force will be formed with Yolanda [de] Gavidia in the chair...\"\n\nShrake 3 WS, para. 35.\n\nShrake 2 WS, para. 115.\n\nC-296.\n\n6.74.\n\nIn response to this meeting, by letter dated 13 June 2006 to the Minister of Economy (Ms Yolanda de Gavidia),191 Mr Shrake suggested (*inter alia*) that the Mining Law be amended by bolstering environmental protections, levying new taxes on mining and requiring legacy funds for the consequences of mine closures. He then foresaw, expressed in highly optimistic terms, a bright future for the Claimant's mining operations in El Salvador, both for itself and for the people of El Salvador. He did not specifically refer to amending Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.\n\nC-15.\n\n6.75.\n\nOn 30 June 2006, the Minister for the Environment, Mr Barrera, was reported in the press as indicating that he thought mining was not \"convenient\" for El Salvador (in the original Spanish: \"*no conveniente*\").192 This unexpected announcement caused Mr Shrake and Mr Earnest to meet with both Mr Barrera and Ms Yolanda de Gavidia as Ministers of MARN and the Ministry of Industry (MINEC).193 As Mr Shrake testified: \"Minister de Gavidia assured me that Mr Barrera's statements represented only his personal views; that those views were at odds with Administration policy; that the Administration fully supported the [El Dorado] project and intended to comply with El Salvador's applicable laws; and that Mr Barrera no longer remained in good standing within the Administration. I also met personally with Mr Barrera himself, who downplayed the remarks that were reported in the press and said they did not represent official policy. In any event, Mr Barrera proceeded to depart MARN by the end of 2006 (i.e. within about six months after his remarks had been reported by the press).\"194\n\nC-46.\n\nShrake 3 WS, para. 37.\n\nShrake 1 WS, para. 93.\n\n6.76.\n\n*July 2006* : In the El Dorado Project weekly summary for the week ending 7 July 2006, PRES reported to the Claimant:195 \"... Government Related Issues - Tom [Shrake] and Fred [Earnest] met with many government leaders, political advisors, diplomatic representatives, private industry leaders and generators of public opinion the first four days of the week. The most productive meeting was with the Vice President of the Republic and the Minister of Environment. The tone of messages coming out of MARN changed significantly after the meeting.\"\n\nC-717.\n\n6.77.\n\nOn or about 3 July 2006, the Ministry of Economy announced that it would be inviting a consultant from Peru, Dr Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, to review and advise the Ministry of Economy upon the laws relating to mining in El Salvador.196 His terms of reference stated: \"To advise the Ministry of Economy in identifying mechanisms to determine the suitability of mining exploitation in view of the sector's current situation and country conditions, and to identify the aspects that should be modified in the Mining Law such that the mining sector develops as an industry that utilizes proper mining practices to avoid environmental degradation and also provides the benefits of economic and social development to the communities involved.\"197\n\nC-716.\n\nR-129.\n\n6.78.\n\nOn 8 July 2006, by email to Mr Shrake, Mr Earnest reported upon an earlier meeting with the Minister of Economy:198 \"Ministra Gavidia indicated that they are contemplating freezing the issuance of new exploration licenses until the mining law can be reviewed. She also indicated that they are going to bring in a Peruvian to review the law. We should urge them to consider a Chilean (there are arguments both ways)...\". By this time, the Ministry of Economy had already appointed Dr Pulgar-Vidal (from Peru): see above.\n\nC-716.\n\n6.79.\n\nOn 12 July 2006, by email message to a professional colleague, Mr Earnest reported the following in regard to meetings between Mr Shrake, himself, MARN and the Respondent's Vice-President:199\n\n\"... Yesterday we were surprised to arrive at the office of Hugo Barrera [the Environment Minister] and find the Vice-President there for our meeting. The meeting was very productive. We explained that much of what the ministry has been hearing is greatly exaggerated and in many instances simply not true. We invited them to visit Newmont's Ken Snyder mine in Nevada which is geologically very similar and process recovery-wise identical to what we propose for El Dorado. We explained that a mine can be compliant and not present risks to the environment. We further reiterated our commitment to water purification, and to responsible environmental stewardship. Tom [Shrake] explained our goal of building a model mine that will be looked at as a new standard for mines in the Americas and explained that not all mining companies are as responsible as Pacific Rim (note that compliance will allow us to gain the confidence of the gov't). We also explained that we are not afraid of regulation and control, in fact we are accustomed to working in that kind of an environment. The government is not going to publish a message to retract what the minister has already said. It is simply not going to happen as there is too much at risk with the millennial challenge fund. We felt that our meeting opened the door to further dialogue and cooperation, but we realize that there is a lot of work to do.\n\nThis morning we were at a breakfast in which the VP [the Vice-President] was the invited speaker and had the opportunity to talk with her afterwards. She indicated that she will find a way to send a couple of people from MARN to visit the mine and expressed her general optimism that this will all work out for us and El Salvador, however, she reiterated that we must stay off the radar screen as much as possible and not do anything to jeopardize the millennial challenge fund...\"\n\nC-299.\n\n6.80.\n\nOn 23 July 2006, it was reported in the press that the Respondent's Environment Minister and Minister of the Economy were intending to present to the National Assembly the proposed amendments to the Mining Law before the end of 2006.200 These reforms included, mirroring Mr Shrake's letter above, the levying of new mining royalties and \"closing down\" plans. The list did not expressly include any amendment to Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.\n\nC-409.\n\n6.81.\n\n*August 2006:* On 22 August 2006, in his updated report to Pac Rim's Board of Directors,201 Mr Shrake wrote: \"The government continues to work on changes to the mining law and has openly sought our input. They have hired a Peruvian consultant to help in this effort and we have had two private meetings with him. Changes will include tightening the environmental requirements, increasing the taxes and reducing the permit burden for exploration projects. These changes are all in an effort to initiate environmentally sound mining in El Salvador.\" The Tribunal notes that the Claimant (with PRES) had already expressed strong support for these changes.\n\nC-720.\n\n6.82.\n\n*September 2006:* The evidence is neither clear nor complete as to precisely what happened between August and September 2006. On the side of the Claimant and PRES, nothing changed materially: Plan A remained their preferred option. On the Respondent's side, the Ministry of Economy had received the written report of its Peruvian mining consultant, Dr Manuel Pulgar-Vidal.202 In that report dated 11 August 2006 (of some 94 pages), Dr Pulgar-Vidal had concluded that El Salvador required substantial reforms to the practice of mining and the granting of mining licences, especially as regards environmental and social protections.\n\nR-129.\n\n6.83.\n\nThis report, whilst also addressing other deficiencies in the Mining Law, did not specifically deal with the current issue under Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. It did address the issue of surface land more generally in a section addressing the direct impacts of mining. In paragraph 6.1.1.1, \"Access to Land\", it read (with paragraphs here marked thus [...] for ease of reference):\n\n[1] \"Access to land has historically been one of the more contentious issues surrounding the development of an activity such as mining. The fact that our legal systems distinguish between rights to subsoil resources and rights regarding surface usage make it so that access must be granted through some legal means, such that the owner of the surface consents to grant a right to the concession holder to access mineral resources.\n\n[2] The customary form recognized in mining law for this type of situation is the mining easement, but under some legislation this can be done through sale purchase agreements and possibly through expropriation of areas when the activity has been prioritized by the State.\n\n[3] In the case of El Salvador, this operates through an easement, but there is no procedure for this; rather the operator must necessarily obtain an authorization from the owner. This can be an advantage, in that this authorization is compulsory, and if denied would impede development of the activity based on a decision by the owner of the land. Yet in the absence of a complementary regulation, this could result in arbitrary acts based on disparity of information.\n\n[4] Furthermore, with regard to this, it should be considered that a contradiction eventually arises in the Mining Law due to the fact that on the one hand authorization from the owner is required in the case of exploration and subsequently, in another article, an easement is required in the case of licenses or concessions.\n\n[5] In practice there would seem to be no conflicts in El Salvador based on the issue of access to land and that could be the result of two situations at work:\n\n- There is no operation currently in the exploitation stage and therefore the permits have only been for exploration activities, which do not result in a substantial change to the surface.\n\n- Owners do not have any information about the activity, how it will be carried out, and the impacts that can occur.\n\n[6] This last element is key, as the extent to which the owner of the surface could eventually and permanently lose the land will greatly depend on how mining activity is carried out. Obviously an open-pit operation entails such an alteration to the surface that the land loses its conditions for development of the activities that are typically carried out on it.\n\n[7] Access to land can involve situations of relocation and migration, and that can be a result of performance of the activity itself or the environmental impacts it causes.\n\n[8] Many countries have sought to regulate the issue of displacement and in any event address it based on practices used by multilateral organizations that have dealt with this subject, such as the World Bank.\"\n\n6.84.\n\nThe publication of Dr Pulgar-Vidal's report generated a political reaction, not limited to the Salvadoran legislature. This reaction was generally unfavourable to mining, including the mining activities proposed by the Claimant and PRES. The Tribunal notes also the reference in paragraphs [5] and [6] above to the effect that surface landowners (and also, presumably, occupiers) did not have sufficient information about underground mining activity, how it would be carried out and the impacts that can occur.\n\n6.85.\n\n*October 2006:* On 2 October 2006, almost two years after PRES' application for an exploitation concession, Ms Navas, as the Director of the Ministry of Economy's Bureau of Hydrocarbons and Mines, wrote a first warning letter to PRES under Article 38 of the Mining Law:203\n\n\"The Bureau, in order to better reach a decision, WARNS the company '[PRES]' through its Legal Representative, who must furnish evidence of his legal capacity, and as established in Articles 36, 37 numeral 2 and 38 of the Mining Law, that within THIRTY DAYS it must submit the following documentation: 1. Certified copies of the duly recorded official transcripts of the property sales agreements or legally executed authorizations from the landowners in the area requested for mining exploitation....\"\n\nR-4.\n\n6.86.\n\nIn her written testimony, Ms Navas explained her reasons for sending this first warning letter:204 \"... having consulted with the Minister of Economy, we decided that it was time to initiate the formal procedure to provide a period of no more than 30 days so that the concession application that had been submitted in an incomplete form in December 2004 could be completed. This was done in order to end the process and close out the case file completely. Therefore, in October 2006, I sent the formal warning letter to Pacific Rim [PRES] indicating the missing information and documents, including the environmental permit, evidence of ownership or permission regarding the entire surface area of the property requested for the concession, and the Feasibility Study.\"\n\nNavas WS, paras. 67-68.\n\n6.87.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this was a significant watershed in the treatment by the Respondent of the Claimant and PRES in regard to the latter's application for an exploitation concession. Until this time, the Ministry (with the Bureau) had supported the Claimant in the hope that, somehow, PRES could be helped to surmount its difficulties. These difficulties were several, both with the Ministry of Economy and MARN; but they had always included Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. Until about September 2006, as he testified, Mr Shrake believed that \"[\u2026] both MINEC and MARN continued to indicate that they supported legal reform to permit the industry, while also affirming that they were responsible for upholding the existing laws.\"205 However, this first warning letter of 2 October 2006 was a new development because its triggered, for the first time, the statutory deadline of 30 days under Article 38 of the Mining Law, as was made explicit in the letter itself.\n\nShrake 3 WS, para. 38.\n\n6.88.\n\nMr Gehlen testified that he received the Bureau's warning letter at PRES, although he understood it to mean that PRES was only being ordered to resubmit \"all the documents that had been attached to the original Concession Application, together with some additional materials.\"206 (Mr Earnest had left PRES in September 2006). Somewhat surprisingly, Mr Shrake testified that he had not seen or known of this warning letter before the hearing in this arbitration.207 However, its contents with a copy of the letter were notified to him at the time by two email messages dated 10 October 2006 from Mr Gehlen.208 Hence, for one reason or another, the warning letter's significance can be assumed to have been missed at the time by Mr Shrake, if not also Mr Gehlen. This was unfortunate, particularly as regards PRES' compliance with Articles 38 and 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.\n\nTr. D2,493.\n\nTr. D2,354-357.\n\nC-693.\n\n6.89.\n\nMoreover, Mr Shrake had always considered the wording of Article 37(2)(b) to be, in his words, no more than a \"glitch\" and a \"snafu.\"209 He had also received legal advice from PRES' Salvadoran lawyer (Mr Medina) that the Bureau's interpretation was nonsense and illogical (see above). He also testified, based upon his extensive practical experience as a miner: \"The reality is that most mines are open-cast mines. They're open-pit mines, and nobody would mine an open-pit mine without surface permissions, whether you acquired the land yourself or whether you sought permissions from the owners of the land. But in an underground mine, in many places you would never have to get permission from the surface landowner for being underneath his land.\"210 Mr Shrake, it will be recalled, is not a lawyer.\n\nTr. D2,362, 364 & 479.\n\nTr. D2,479-480.\n\n6.90.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimant and PRES were unreasonably mistaken in so readily underestimating PRES's predicament in meeting the requirement of Article 37(2)(b), particularly after the Bureau's first warning letter. By now, unless resolved with Plan A or Plan B, this predicament jeopardised the whole of the Claimant's El Dorado Project. There was, it will be recalled, no other plan.\n\n6.91.\n\nOn 19 October 2006, it was reported in the press that the Minister of the Economy (Ms Yolanda de Gavidia) considered that the Mining Law should be reformed to increase taxes and to make environmental regulatory norms more rigorous.211 This was, in the circumstances, a general endorsement of the recommendations made in Dr Pulgar-Vidal's report. There was no reference to reforming Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.\n\nC-694.\n\n6.92.\n\n*November 2006:* On 9 November 2006, by a press release signed by Mr Shrake, the Claimant publicly summarised its understanding of the current situation regarding the Mining Law, acknowledging that PRES might not now be able to get its concession until the Mining Law was amended.212 Headed \"Mining Law and Permitting Update\", the relevant passages read (with paragraph numbers here added]:\n\n\"[1] El Salvador's current Mining Law was enacted in 1996, since which time numerous Exploration Licenses (which are equivalent to exploration claims) have been granted. Pacific Rim Mining Corp. has applied for an Exploitation Concession (which is equivalent to a mining permit) for a portion of its El Dorado gold project, the first advanced-stage exploration project to have gotten to this point under El Salvador's current Mining Law. Moving this project through the application process has identified shortcomings in the current law that would benefit from reform.\n\n[2] El Salvador's governing party (ARENA), the primary opposition party (FMLN), most minority parties (PCN, PDC, & CD) and importantly, Pacific Rim Mining Corp. are in favour of reforming the El Salvadoran Mining Law. In considering the potential modifications, the El Salvador government is reviewing the laws of countries with established mining industries and well-regarded mining laws including Chile, Peru, Canada and the USA, is considering the positions of all sides of the political spectrum and is consulting with various mining companies including Pacific Rim Mining Corp. The current Salvadoran administration has proven during its past 10 years in government to be an administration that is committed to attracting foreign investment in order to advance their economy. In fact, the Economic Freedom Rankings of the Heritage Foundation placed El Salvador second only to Chile as the freest economy in Latin America. Pacific Rim is fully supportive of reforms to the Mining Law, believing that El Salvador has the opportunity to become the model for framing a responsible mining industry and looks forward to providing input on the reformed law and working with all parties involved.\n\n[3] Pacific Rim's Exploitation Concession application for the El Dorado project remains in process. However it is uncertain whether the El Dorado Exploitation Concession will be granted prior to the forthcoming reformation of the El Salvadoran Mining Law. The Company's application for an Exploitation Concession requires several documents, including an Environmental Permit that is expected to be granted upon final approval of the Company's El Dorado project Environmental Impact Study (\"EIS\") by the Environmental and Natural Resources Ministry (\"MARN\"). The EIS, originally submitted in September 2004, received technical approval in September 2005, and was published for public comment in late 2005. In March 2006, Pacific Rim received from MARN a list of issues raised during the public comment period and was asked to amend the EIS to address these issues. The amended EIS was resubmitted to MARN, which recently requested clarification on a number of items. The Company's responses to these requests have been provided. A timeframe for final approval of the El Dorado EIS has not been assigned. As such, and further considering the impending changes to the Mining Law, the Company is unable to provide a definitive timeframe as to when its El Dorado Exploitation Concession will be granted.\n\n[4] Pacific Rim has received tremendous support in its endeavors from the El Salvadoran government, particularly the Ministry of Economy, which is responsible for granting Exploitation Concessions. The government has demonstrated itself to be supportive of mining and Pacific Rim is working diligently with the administration, opposition parties, business groups and civil society to secure its mining permit for El Dorado as soon as possible.\"\n\nC-309.\n\n6.93.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr Shrake here concentrated on PRES' difficulties with MARN over its missing environmental permit and the need for amendments to the Mining Law in that regard. There was no express reference to PRES' specific difficulties with the Bureau and the Ministry of Economy regarding Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law on surface ownership and authorizations, requiring no less an amendment to the Mining Law under the Claimant's preferred Plan A.\n\n6.94.\n\nOn 8 November 2006 (prior to Mr Shrake's press release above), Mr Gehlen, as PRES' legal representative, responded by letter dated 7 November 2006 to the Bureau, in material part as follows:213 \"The company has been notified of the resolution dated October second, two thousand six granting it a term of THIRTY DAYS to submit the documentation listed therein to this Bureau. In response to that notice, we are attaching the following: 1. Certified copies of the following documents: [there here follows a list of documents lettered (a) to (h) describing 6 purchase-sale agreements, 1 lease agreement with an option to buy and 1 land owned by PRES]...\"\n\nR-5.\n\n6.95.\n\nAs Mr Gehlen testified:214 \"With regard to these other documents [i.e. including those under paragraph \"1\" above], I did not interpret the Notice as implying anything about the sufficiency of the materials that we had previously submitted. From my reading, the Notice was just ordering us to resubmit *all* the documents that had been attached to the original concession application, together with some additional materials...\" [emphasis in the original]. These additional materials did not therefore include new authorizations or ownerships regarding the surface area of the requested concession.\n\nGehlen WS, para. 178.\n\n6.96.\n\nAccordingly, so the Tribunal finds, the Bureau now received from PRES on 8 November 2006 only what it had already received with PRES' application on 22 December 2004 as regards the documentation required under Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. As already noted above, this documentation covered less than 13% of the total surface area of the requested concession. PRES could not therefore satisfy the requirement of Article 37(2)(b) as interpreted by the Bureau, the Ministry of Economy and the Presidential Secretariat; nor did PRES meet the demands of the Bureau's first warning letter.\n\n6.97.\n\nMr Gehlen's testimony continued, by way of explanation:215\n\n\"[181]. With regard to the item of the Notice relating to ownership or authorization for surface property, I knew that in 2005 Ms. Navas had discussed this with Mr Earnest and had proposed making a reform to the mining law that would clarify this issue. However, presentation of the reform proposal was delayed at the request of President Saca until the Summer of 2006, at which time the Ministers of MINEC and MARN had jointly proposed a broader legislative reform related to mining. As I mentioned above, this mining law reform was being discussed in November 2006, at the time that we were presenting our responses to the Department of Mines. Therefore, from the company's perspective, the issue of surface ownership or authorization remained unclear. We were not sure whether this would end up being clarified as part of the legislative reform process or, if not, what the position or instructions of the Department of Mines would ultimately be.\n\n[182]. One way or another, we were willing to work cooperatively with the Government, as we always had, and to let the Department of Mines take the lead in suggesting the way forward on this issue. Although I know that the Government has now tried to put a lot of importance on this issue in the arbitration, I think I can speak for everyone in the company when I say that we never viewed this as a determinative factor in our ability to proceed with our mining project. On the other hand, the company already owned all the land that we were going to use or disturb for the project, so we were obviously reluctant to start buying up additional tracts of land which we would not have any use for. We certainly did not want to displace or interfere with the people who owned the lands when we had no reason to do so, nor did we necessarily want to assume responsibility for administering or maintaining them. Further, as I discuss further below, we did not know what kind of 'authorization' we would or could be expected to obtain in lieu of buying or leasing the property outright, and although Mr Earnest had raised this with the Department of Mines, they had not yet provided us with any advice about this matter.\n\n[183]. In any event, as I also discuss further below, the company has never had any problems obtaining authorization from the local landowners to carry out surface works in the El Dorado project area, and I had no reason to doubt that we would be able [to] obtain whatever additional 'authorizations' that we could reasonably be expected to obtain. In the meantime, we simply submitted to the Department all the deeds and contracts that we had in relation to our surface rights. Again, we were never told or received any communication from the Department after our submission indicating that what we had submitted was insufficient.\"\n\nGehlen WS, paras. 181-183.\n\n6.98.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept this explanation. Mr Gehlen (with Mr Shrake) should have understood better the imminent threat posed by the Bureau's first warning letter as regards PRES' non-compliance with the requirement of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. The Claimant and PRES were by now firmly committed to Plan A. However, after many months, Plan A remained still only a plan. As regards Plan B, it remained a significant practical difficulty for PRES, for the several reasons earlier explained by Mr Earnest to Ms Navas. It was also not the task of the Bureau or the Ministry of Economy to advise the Claimant or PRES on how to overcome any of its difficulties. It appears that the Bureau had little practical experience in the implementation of Article 37(2)(b) in regard to a major concession for an underground mine. With their advisers and other resources, the Claimant and PRES could have considered Plan B much further, if only as a contingency. However, by now, the Claimant and PRES had effectively put 'all their eggs in one basket': it was to be Plan A - and only Plan A.\n\n6.99.\n\n*December 2006:* On 4 December 2006, Ms Navas, as the Director of the Bureau, replied to PRES with a second warning letter, as follows;216 \"... Having received on the eighth of November, two thousand six the document and attachments whereby Mr William Thomas Gehlen, Legal Representative of the Company \"[PRES]\" partially complies with the warning notice dated the second of October, two thousand six, and also requests that the deadline for the presentation of the documentation relating to the environmental permit be suspended and that the company be granted three days from the delivery of the permit by the corresponding Authority to submit it in turn to this Bureau...\" The Bureau then warned PRES to submit the Environmental Permit and the EIS within 30 business days.\n\nR-6.\n\n6.100.\n\nNothing more was here said expressly in regard to Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. However, there should have been no misunderstanding by PRES. With documentation covering only about 13% of the surface area of the requested concession, Mr Gehlen (for PRES and the Claimant) knew that the proffered documentation did not meet the statutory requirement as interpreted by the Bureau, the Ministry of Economy and the Presidential Secretariat. The Tribunal does not accept Mr Shrake's testimony to the contrary, namely: \"As of December 2006, PRES believed it had submitted all of the documentation required for an exploitation concession at El Dorado, except for the environmental permit.\"217 It will be recalled that Mr Shrake denied having seen the Bureau's first warning letter, although Mr Gehlen sent it to him at the time and knew its contents (see above). Mr Gehlen certainly saw both warning letters.\n\nShrake 1 WS, para. 88.\n\n6.101.\n\nIn her written statement, Ms Navas testified as follows in regard to this second warning letter:218\n\n\"[69]. Pac Rim [PRES] partially responded to the warning letter in November 2006, claiming to submit documents and information that fulfilled the request in the warning letter, except for the environmental permit, with regard to which it argued a just impediment to submitting it, and asked for the deadline to be extended indefinitely, citing provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure to that end.\n\n[70]. It must be kept in mind that the preliminary review stage of a concession application only seeks to determine whether the application is complete. This preliminary review does not fully evaluate whether the documents and information submitted are in fact sufficient to establish material compliance with the requirements.\n\n[71]. Taking the above into account, as well as the fact that Pacific Rim [PRES] admitted in its November 2006 reply that it did not have the environmental permit, but argued a just impediment regarding this, and having consulted with the Ministry's legal advisor, it was decided to send a second warning letter focused solely on the environmental permit because just impediment had been argued. Just impediment was not argued for the other requirements requested; consequently they remained outstanding. This second warning letter, though not contemplated under the Mining Law, was justified under the Code of Civil Procedure, given that even though the concept of just impediment was accepted, Pacific Rim [PRES] was only granted an additional 30-day period within which to submit the environmental permit.\n\n[72]. The fact that the second warning letter states that Pacific Rim partially addressed the first warning letter, and that it only references the missing environmental permit, does not reflect that all the other missing requirements cited in the first warning letter had been favorably fulfilled. The only thing that means is that Pacific Rim submitted some new documents, that it argued that those documents were the missing requirements, and it only admitted that it lacked the environmental permit and claimed just impediment only with regard to that requirement.... \"\n\n\"[74]. There is one remaining fact that must be clarified with regard to the second warning letter sent to Pacific Rim in December 2006. After Pacific Rim had been formally notified of the second warning letter, the Minister of Economy, for reasons I will explain below, ordered me to withdraw it.\n\n[75]. Yolanda de Gavidia, the Minister of Economy, ordered me to withdraw the second warning letter because she told me she had spoken with the President of the Republic [President Saca] about finding another solution to the situation, and that was to present a Moratorium Law for Metallic Mining while the Strategic Environmental Assessment study on Mining in El Salvador was completed. As a result she directed that we proceed in another way with the warning letter issued to Pacific Rim.\"\n\nNavas WS, paras. 69-75; Tr. D3,705-706 & 710.\n\n6.102.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Bureau's second warning letter did not replace its first warning letter. The second letter affected the time-limit imposed under Article 38 of the Mining Law; but it left intact the formal warning as to paragraph 1 of the first letter regarding the missing documentation required Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.\n\n6.103.\n\nOn 18 December 2006, a meeting took place between PRES, the Bureau and the Ministry of Economy. By an email message dated 18 December 2006 from Mr Rodrigo Chavez (of PRES) to Mr Shrake, PRES described its content as follows:219\n\n\"... This morning we had the meeting with the Minister of Econom\u00eda, Yolanda de Gavidia. The meeting was attended by Fidel Chavez, Francisco Escobar, Rodrigo Chavez, Gina Navas and Yolanda de Gavidia. She [the Minister] agreed with nearly all of the recommendations we had, regarding the changes in the mining law. She only stressed that 1% of the royalties be used for the closure of the mine. Additionally, she wants to eliminate the prerogative that the current law has of designating certain areas for the development of government projects related to the mining industry. However, it is clear that her margin of manoeuver is not very big. She is still waiting for instructions of her superiors. She agreed that getting the other two political parties, PDC and PCN, on board was key, in order to give the Administration the support it needs to move forward. She also said that she was willing to fight the new initiative to ban mining and that she expected our help in this regard. She also mentioned that she has plenty of problems with the companies exploring in Chalatenango and that we should make some kind of united front as an industry or at least have a unified position on important aspects. In general terms, the meeting was positive. At the moment, the priority is to continue to gain ground with the FMLN and get the support of the PCN. Additionally, once this is more advanced, we would need to talk to the No.1 Decision maker (the president) and his closest advisers...\"\n\nC-727.\n\n6.104.\n\nMr Fidel Ch\u00e1vez was a Salvadoran politician, a former Foreign Minister of the Respondent and President of the Organization of American States whom Mr Shrake had engaged as an adviser earlier in the year.220 Mr Rodrigo Ch\u00e1vez, his son, was by now a Vice-President of PRES. Mr Francisco Escobar was one of several professional lobbyists engaged by PRES. He was the brother-in-law of the Vice-President, Ms Ana Vilma de Escobar.221\n\nShrake 3 WS, para. 39.\n\nTr. D2,454-456.\n\n6.105.\n\nOn 21 December 2006, by a written memorandum, the Minister of the Economy (Ms Yolanda de Gavidia) proposed to the President (President Saca) a three-year moratorium on metallic mining. The moratorium was intended (by proposed new legislation) to preclude the grant of metallic mineral concessions, including those currently pending.222 It was thus intended to affect, when implemented, PRES' pending application for a concession.\n\nR-167.\n\n***G. 2007***\n-------------\n\n6.106.\n\n*January 2007:* In January 2007, according to the Respondent's case in this arbitration, the thirty-day corrective period ended under Article 38 of the Mining Law, as cited in the Bureau's two warning letters. As calculated by the Respondent, that thirty-day period had begun to run upon PRES' receipt of the Bureau's second warning letter dated 21 December 2006. The Tribunal does not accept this calculation.\n\n6.107.\n\nThe evidence shows that this second letter was informally treated by the Bureau as having been 'withdrawn', as was made known to PRES at the time. It was treated by the Ministry of Economy as never having been sent to PRES. The reasons for this are not clear on the evidence adduced before the Tribunal in this arbitration. The Bureau's first letter was not, however, withdrawn by the Bureau or the Ministry of Economy. It thus remained open to PRES to force the issue under Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law with legal proceedings under Article 7 of the Mining Regulations; but it did not do so.\n\n6.108.\n\nIn January 2007 (albeit announced a month earlier), Mr Carlos Guerrero became the new Minister of the Environment (replacing Mr Hugo C\u00e9sar Barrera).223 The Minister of Economy remained Ms Yolanda de Gavidia. She was to resign later in 2008.\n\nC-47.\n\n6.109.\n\n*May 2007:* On 3 May 2007, by internal email, Mr Shrake reported to his senior colleagues:224 \"... Mark May 2 on your calendar. It's the day the tide changed. The president has instructed the head of the party and his chief political advisor to meet with us to discuss a pro-mining documentary in ES [El Salvador]. He has seen the light...\"\n\nC-305.\n\n6.110.\n\nOn 5 May 2007, by an internal email to Mr Shrake and Mr Neilans,225 PRES (Mr Rodrigo Ch\u00e1vez) reported on this meeting with President Saca: \"... Saca said that he was not antimining but worried about the social conflict that could arise. He said that we should work with the two people he had mentioned on Wednesday (Silvia Aguilar and Tom\u00e1s L\u00f3pez) so we could sort the issues out. As for the law reform, he said he had to see the document that we proposed before he agreed upon it. He then said he would give my father a formal meeting only on mining to discuss the details of this, after we have spoken to Silvia Aguilar and T\u00f3mas L\u00f3pez...\" This reference to \"Wednesday\" referred to the earlier meeting with President Saca on Wednesday, 2 May 2017 described by Mr Shrake above.\n\nC-739.\n\n6.111.\n\nOn 7 May 2007, at a meeting of mining companies (including Ms Colindres, now of PRES) addressed by Mr Guerrero (as the new Minister of the Environment) and Ms Yolanda de Gavidia (still as the Minister of Economy), the mining companies were informed that all mining activity in El Salvador would be halted until such time as the Government completed a 'Strategic Environmental Assessment'.226 This was the implementation, *de facto*, of the moratorium considered earlier in mid-December 2006. However, no law implementing such a moratorium was enacted by the Legislative Assembly. Hence, the Mining Law remained in full force and legal effect.\n\nColindres 1 WS, para. 146; Shrake 2 WS, para. 127.\n\n6.112.\n\nAs Ms Navas testified, this *de facto* moratorium benefited the Claimant: \"[PRES] would continue to explore the area under Concession because it needed more information to complete its Feasibility Study. This would have given it the time to complete the Feasibility Study in order for it to obtain permits or to buy the land it was missing.\"227 (Ms Navas later resigned from the Bureau in or soon after May 2007).\n\nTr. D3,732.\n\n6.113.\n\nOn 24 May 2007, by internal email, Mr Shrake reported to his colleagues on his recent visit to El Salvador, *inter alia,* as follows228: \".... I'm optimistic that barring any atmospheric changes within the country, the law will be reformed in July [2007]. This will set the stage for our permit sometime afterwards..\" (The latter was a reference to the environmental permit requested of MARN).\n\nC-728.\n\n6.114.\n\n*June 2007* : On 14 June 2007, it was reported in the press that the Minister of the Environment, Mr Guerrero, and the Minister of the Economy would send the proposed amendments to the Mining Law \"before the end of the year.\"229\n\nC-741.\n\n6.115.\n\n*July 2007* : In his updated report to Pac Rim's Board of Directors dated 5 July 2005, Mr Shrake wrote: \"... Momentum continues to build for the mining law reform which will precede the issuance of our permit. A macro-economic study of the impact of mining was presented to the government and the public and was well received. That and our radio programming continue to positively affect public opinion. Two members of the cabinet are championing our cause: within the administration: Vice President Escobar and the Technical Director Zablah. We understand that the PCN party has been negotiating with President Saca over a variety of political issues and has gotten the okay from the administration to proceed with the introduction of the mining law reform in July. The administration just needs the time to review the law which they started last week in a three hour meeting with our people. The board that oversees MARN (the ES environmental regulatory agency) has also come around to understand that what we are proposing is not environmentally risky. It appears as though we have turned the tide and I expect to see the law reform completed before the end of August [2007], hopefully sooner..\"\n\n6.116.\n\nOn 18 July 2007, by email to Mr Shrake, Mr Neilans (of Pac Rim) relayed a written report from PRES (Mr Rodrigo Chavez), under the heading \"Mining Law update\":230\n\n\"... As discussed, the mining law will be introduced when the President is on board. The most recent date for introduction, next week, will likely pass (again) as we have not been summoned to present to him yet. This is dependent on Zablah recommending the pursuance of mining to the President, which he hasn't done as of yet. Rodrigo thinks that with the President's return to the country Tuesday this week that the Zablah-Saca [meeting] may happen late this week or early next week. At an unrelated social event, Fidel and Rodrigo spoke with the President and were told to contact him early next week to set something up. Zablah has been briefed now on the economics (Hinds)231, the law (Fidel), the sociopolitical, the geology and the environment (by Rodrigo et al) and so has the full complement of details. The Ministry of Economy has also been briefed and is apparently on board; Rodrigo, Francisco, Manuel and Fidel met with the Directorate of Minerals and gave them the full briefing. Between the 4 of them they have follow-up meetings with many of the public figures again next week. Ar\u00e9valo, Environmental Commission, has told Rodrigo that he wants the law introduced ASAP and will be sending a letter to the Executive Branch next week asking for a new law to be introduced within 8 working days. This would put it near the break for the recess or just after, if it occurs on his suggestion. It is not certain whether the Arena party would introduce it, or one of the minority parties, but that isn't a critical issue. Zablah has read the proposed law with his advisors and they are generally in agreement. Rodrigo doesn't see that it would require any major revisions from Zablah's perspective. I am not sure when the final draft will be ready but I believe we are looking at early next week. I have asked that Sandra Orihuela have a quick review of it if she has time.\"\n\nC-740.\n\nMr Manuel Hinds, a former Minister of Finance of the Respondent, was engaged as an adviser to PRES (Shrake 3 WS, para. 43).\n\n6.117.\n\n*August 2007* : By internal email dated 14 August 2007,232 Mr Shrake informed his colleagues that the head of the Partido de Concertaci\u00f3n Nacional [the PCN] \"has informed us that the president has agreed to move forward on mining and our permit. We have received the same news from President Saca who has appointed his cousin Herbert Saca as his point man. Fidel Chavez, our leading lobbyist and political strategist will meet with Herbert this week to discuss details for getting this done ASAP. I'll wait until the permit is in hand to pop the champagne but I think it's time to get it on ice.\"\n\nC-307.\n\n6.118.\n\n*November 2007:* On 20 November 2007, draft amendments to the Mining Law were presented to the Legislative Assembly by members of the PCN.233 These proposed drafts included amendments modifying the existing scope of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. As there proposed, there was now to be a new Article 54(e). It read:\n\n\"Art 54. The concessionaire wishing to commence the Exploitation phase, as provided in the first paragraph of Article 38 of this Law, shall attach the following documentation to its application:... (e) For Underground mining, the applicant shall provide a notarized copy of the deed showing title in its name, or of the legally granted authorization and in which it is clearly specified that the owner of the property or properties on which all of the necessary infrastructure for operation of the mine will be located also authorizes that the mineral processing plant and mining waste disposal be included thereon;....\"\n\nAs proposed, this wording was to limit the required 'title' to the surface area affected by the mine's infrastructure (i.e. \"on which\"). Hence, PRES' predicament under Article 37(2)(b) would be resolved.\n\nC-743.\n\n6.119.\n\nAs regards applications in progress (such as PRES' application for a concession), there was to be a new Article 98 of the Mining Law. It read: \"Without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding article, exploration license holders or those who have, during the term of an exploration license, applied to the Bureau of Mines and Hydrocarbons of the Ministry of Economy for a mineral Exploitation and Usage Concession, who have demonstrated as of the entry into force of this Law the existence of mining potential in the authorized area pursuant to the submission of a pre-feasibility study, shall continue with their application processing. Applications will be decided by the Minister of Economy via Ministerial Resolution, in accordance with the provisions of this Law.... Upon satisfaction of the legal requirements, the Minister of Economy shall grant acknowledgment of the mining concession and the authorization to commence the exploitation phase, in the maximum term of sixty days.\" Hence, again, PRES' predicament under Article 37(2)(b) would be resolved as to any retrospective issue of timing.\n\n6.120.\n\nThe Claimant (with PRES) had contributed to these legislative proposals. Mr Shrake testified: \"[t]his bill was prepared with input from my advisors, and with indirect input from Pac Rim.\"234 As pleaded in the Claimant's Reply, \"[a]lthough company officials did not participate directly in discussions with the PCN about the bill, the draft did contain input from several of the company's consultants.\"235 At the hearing, the Claimant's counsel acknowledged that PRES (with the Claimant) was participating in January 2008 in meetings at the Legislative Assembly on these proposals.236. Ms Yolanda de Gavidia testified that the Ministry of Economy had not been involved in the preparation and promotion of this draft law (she was to leave office in June 2008).237\n\nShrake 3 WS, para. 47.\n\nReply, para. 456.\n\nTr. D7.1925-1926.\n\nYolanda de Gavidia WS, para. 14; Tr. D3,648-649.\n\n6.121.\n\nMr Shrake testified that, from his company's perspective, \"... the mining law reform effort [in November 2007] had three main goals: (1) to provide 'political cover' to the Administration to publicly support mining, by creating a break with the past and implementing a new and more restrictive regime for the industry; (2) to ensure that Pac Rim would be subject to all the requirements of the new law (such as higher royalties and more stringent environmental standards), without prejudicing the legal rights that we had acquired under the old law, *i*.*e*., the right to be granted the concession; and (3) to ensure that the mining industry would be regulated by better-funded and organized regulatory agencies, and that mining royalties would be channelled to institutions who would be required to use them for the public benefit. These were the concepts that I conveyed to my advisors, who, at least as far as I know, conveyed them to the congressmen they were working with to garner support for the reform bill.\"238 These were not, however, Mr Shrake's only goals. It is clear from the wording of these legislative proposals that these goals included an amendment to Section 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.\n\nShrake 3WS, para. 47.\n\n6.122.\n\nThe legislative proposals were not enacted by the Legislative Assembly. As Mr Shrake testified: \"After its presentation to the *Asamblea* on 22 November 2007, the reform bill was referred to the Committee of Agriculture and Environment for further consideration and a recommendation. On 11 December 2007, the Committee of Environment and Agriculture of the *Asamblea Legislativa* hosted a forum in San Salvador with the goal of discussing the possible economic, social and environmental impacts of metallic mining in the country. Various presentations were given by anti-mining NGOs, representatives of Pac Rim, and mining law specialists from Per\u00fa and Chile. [\u2026] Over the next two months, the mining law reform remained under consideration by the relevant congressional committee, and Pac Rim understood that it would be recommended for reconsideration by the full *Asamblea* at some point soon.\"239\n\nShrake 3WS, paras. 51 & 52 (footnotes omitted).\n\n***H. 2008***\n-------------\n\n6.123.\n\n*January 2008:* Mr Shrake visited El Salvador in January 2008. He testified: \"... I again met with senior officials of the Government, including Mr Guillermo Gallegos. Mr Gallegos was, at the time, the Majority Leader in Congress. Mr Gallegos told me he was confident that MARN would issue the [environmental] permits, and, moreover, that the proposed amendments to the Mining Law (which included clarification of any outstanding issue concerning the surface property issue) would be approved in February of 2008.\"240\n\nShrake 1 WS, para. 101.\n\n6.124.\n\n*February 2008* : The proposed amendments were not enacted by the Legislative Assembly in February 2008.\n\n6.125.\n\n*March 2008:* On 11 March 2008, President Saca was publicly reported, in the press, as having stated on 10 March 2008 that 'in principle', he was against the granting of permits for new mining exploitations and was asking the Legislative Assembly to review the issue in depth. There were at that time, so it was also reported, about 26 mining projects awaiting exploitation permits.241 The next day, it was reported that President Saca had stated that he was only willing to work with the Legislative Assembly on the mining issue after it had been demonstrated to him, through studies from the Ministry of the Environment (MARN) and the Ministry of the Economy, that \"gold can be exploited to boost the economy without damaging resources.\"242 These announcements came as an unpleasant shock to the Claimant and PRES. They had still expected that the Mining Law, including Article 37(2)(b), would be amended by the Legislative Assembly. (In this arbitration, as earlier indicated, the Claimant describes President Saca's reported statements of 11 March 2008 as a \"*de facto* mining ban in El Salvador\").\n\nC-1.\n\nR-125.\n\n6.126.\n\nAs Mr Shrake testified: \"... these statements [by President Saca] were surprising and extremely disappointing to me. The majority party in Congress was the ARENA party, and President Saca was the president of that party. It was my understanding from my advisors that the ARENA party was largely in support of the PCN's proposal to pass a new mining law that would create a more responsible and regulated industry, with a greater share of revenues going to the Government, thereby facilitating the granting of Pac Rim's permits. I had also understood from my advisors up until the date of President Saca's statements that he would not oppose the mining law reform proposed by the PCN, which at that point we expected to be ratified in the short term. \"243\n\nShrake 3 WS, para. 54; see also Shrake 1 WS, para. 116.\n\n6.127.\n\nThere never was to be any legislation by the Legislative Assembly amending Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. The wording of Article 37(2)(b) thus remained exactly as it had been since 1995, before the Claimant became interested in mining in El Salvador. As a result of the Bureau's interpretation of Article 37(2)(b), as Ms Navas testified, PRES' application for a concession \"did not comply with two other requirements the Mining Law establishes as necessary in order for the concession application to be admitted.\"244 As Ms Yolanda de Gavidia also testified: PRES was not able to meet \"the requirement in connection with the ownership of the land covered by the Concession.\"245 Accordingly, the Claimant's Plan A had come to nothing, leaving its predicament unresolved as at 10 March 2008, just as it had been from 22 December 2004 onwards.\n\nNavas WS, para. 59.\n\nTr. D3,672.\n\n6.128.\n\nThe date of 10 March 2008 is procedurally significant for the Claimant's case, as already recited above in Part 1 of this Award. It is the date before which the Claimant (with PRES and DOREX) foreswore any claim for damages against the Respondent in this arbitration.\n\n***I. 2009***\n-------------\n\n6.129.\n\n*February 2009* : On 26 February 2009, President Saca was publicly reported, in the press, as stating the he would grant no mining concession to Pacific Rim; that he would rather face an arbitration and its consequences than permit the company's operations; and that \"[a]ccording to my legal advisors, we have no obligation to grant the exploitation permit, even though they have the exploration permit [\u2026]\"246\n\nC-4.\n\n6.130.\n\n*April 2009:* On 30 April 2009, the Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration in these arbitration proceedings, having previously served its Notice of Intent upon the Respondent on 9 December 2008.\n\n**PART VII: LIABILITY - EL DORADO - THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n7.1.\n\nIn summary,247 the Claimant contends that its primary claim regarding El Dorado arises under Salvadoran law, which (so it submits) provides protections under its Investment Law that were equal to or greater than the protections provided to a foreign investor under customary international law. The Claimant also claims the protections afforded under customary international law. To these ends, it invokes Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. It does not invoke Article 42(3) of the ICSID Convention (nor could it in this arbitration).\n\nThis summary, here and below, is largely based on the Claimant's oral submissions at the hearing and its Post hearing brief.\n\n7.2.\n\nThe Claimant first contends, as summarised in Part III above, that PRES complied with all the requirements of the Mining Law for the purpose of having the Respondent accept its application for an exploitation concession under the Mining Law for El Dorado, within the 12.75 sq. km area identified in PRES' application for a concession submitted to the Bureau at the Ministry of Economy on 22 December 2004. Alternatively, if and when it did not so, the Claimant contends that the Respondent is estopped or precluded from contending otherwise in this arbitration under international law or, under Salvadoran law, under the doctrine of *actos propios*.\n\n7.3.\n\nUnder the Investment Law, in failing to grant the El Dorado exploitation concession, the Claimant submits that the Respondent violated: (i) the right to efficient legal procedures under Article 4; (ii) the right to appropriate treatment in accordance with law under Article 5; (iii) the prohibition of arbitrary and discriminatory measures under Article 6; (iv) the prohibition of expropriation without compensation under Article 8; and (v) the right to protection of property under Article 13 of the Investment Law.248 (These Articles of the Investment Law are recited in Part II above). The Claimant also contends that the Tribunal has the right and duty to apply rules of customary international law to the Parties' dispute.\n\nCL-4.\n\n7.4.\n\nIn summary,249 the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to show that PRES met the requirements of Article 37(2) of the Mining Law in several material respects, as regards (i) land ownership and authorisation; (ii) a complete exploitation plan; (iii) a feasibility study; and (iv) an environmental permit. Without meeting all those statutory requirements, so the Respondent contends, PRES had no legal right to obtain and the Respondent no legal obligation to grant the requested concession under the Mining Law (or otherwise) as a matter of Salvadoran law. The Respondent also contends that no form of estoppel or *actos propios* arises in favour of the Claimant in regard to Article 37(2) of the Mining Law. Hence, according to the Respondent, these are threshold matters necessary to establish the Claimant's claims without which all such claims must fail *in limine*.\n\nThis summary, here and below, is largely based on the Respondent's oral submissions at the hearing and its Posthearing brief.\n\n7.5.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to address the first principal issue listed in Part IV above in regard to the ownership and authorisation of surface land under Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. As explained by the Tribunal later below, it is a threshold issue for the Claimant's claim as regards the Respondent's liability for damages in regard to the El Dorado Project (being also relevant to certain of its claims regarding Other Mining Areas). It is also appropriate for the Tribunal to treat separately the subissues arising from: (i) the Parties' different legal interpretations of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law and (ii) the Parties' different cases on estoppel or *actos propios* (in the event that the Claimant's case should not prevail on the first sub-issue of interpretation).\n\n***B. The Interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.6.\n\nThe Parties agree that, for the interpretation of the Mining Law, the applicable law is the law of El Salvador.250 (The Claimant also pleads the related question of estoppel as a matter of international law; but that is not relevant to this first sub-issue of statutory interpretation). Under Salvadoran law, the interpretation and application of the Mining Law may involve the Constitution,251 the Environmental Law,252 the Mining Regulations253 and general principles of administrative law.254\n\nTr. Day 1,117:3; Tr. Day 5.1131-1133: Tr. Day 5.1144- 45\n\nCLA-1.\n\nCLA-2.\n\nCLA-6.\n\nFernandois ER 1, pp. 44-50.\n\n7.7.\n\nThe Mining Law was enacted on 14 December 1995; it came into force on 24 January 1996; it was amended on 11 July 2001; and it was not amended thereafter. Accordingly, at all material times, its legislative text was the law in effect prior to and during the Claimant's relevant activities (with PRES and DOREX) in El Salvador.\n\n7.8.\n\nThe Mining Law's objective (as stated in its preamble) was to regulate the exploration, exploitation, processing and commercialization of non-renewable natural resources in El Salvador.255 Chapter VI of the Mining Law sets out the \"Procedure for the Presentation of Applications and Annexed Documents\" required from persons interested in obtaining licences and concessions from the Respondent. This principal issue concerns PRES' application for an exploitation concession on 22 December 2004 for El Dorado. It was already the holder of exploration licences at El Dorado.\n\nCLA-5.\n\n7.9.\n\nArticle 36 of Chapter VI of the Mining Law is drafted in mandatory language (\"... will have to present to the Direction a written application with at least the following requirements [with list of such requirements (a) to (f)]\". Article 37 addresses the \"Annexed Documents\", in similar mandatory language (\"... will also have to be presented.)\" Three lists follow, the first in regard to an \"Exploration Licence; the second in regard to a \"Concession of Exploitation of Mines and Quarries\"; and the third in regard to \"Processing Plants.\"\n\n7.10.\n\nThis second list regarding an exploitation concession has been cited as Article 37(2) of the Mining Law. It comprises of sub-paragraphs (a) to (f). It is appropriate here to cite this list in full, as follows:\n\n*\"37(2)*\n\n*a) A location map of the real [e]state in which the activities are to be realized, a cartographic sheet of the area, a topographic map and its respective technical description, extent of the solicited area in which the location, borders and names of the adjacent properties are convincingly established;*\n\n*(b) The property title for the real estate or authorized permission, in legal form, from the landowner;*\n\n*(c) An Environmental Permit granted by the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources along with a copy of the Environmental Impact Study or Environmental Diagnostic;*\n\n*d) A Feasibility Study done by a geologist or professional in the subject matter;*\n\n*(e) An exploitation program for the first five years, signed by a geologist or other competent professional in the matter;*\n\n*(f) Along with the rest of which will be established in the regulations.\"*\n\n7.11.\n\nFor the present issue, it is Articles 37(2)(a) and 37(2)(b) which are relevant, particularly the latter.256 In short, as a matter of statutory interpretation, does its requirement regarding the presentation of \"title\" or \"authorized permission\" (as attachments to an application for an exploitation concession) apply to the *whole* of the surface area on and under which the activities are to be realized by the applicant; or is it limited to only that *part* of its surface area affected by the applicant's activities?\n\nCLA-5. As noted in Part II above, the Respondent translates these provisions into English as follows: \"(a) Plot plan of the property where the activities will be carried out, a cartographic map of the area, topographic plan and its respective technical description, extension of the requested area where its location, boundaries and name of bordering properties are irrefutably established; (b) The ownership deed of the property or the authorization legally granted by the owner;...\" [RL-7(bis)]. The Tribunal does not consider these minor linguistic differences in the English translations to be of any material significance to the present issue.\n\n***C. The Claimant's Submissions on Interpretation***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n7.12.\n\nIn summary,257 the Claimant contends that PRES submitted authorisations from all the surface landowners for the surface area to be affected or likely to be affected during the period of the requested concession at El Dorado; that PRES did have rights over all surface areas that would be occupied or disturbed by its development of a mine for the Minita deposits; and that PRES had executed a lease agreement with an option to buy all the real estate that is or would be occupied by the mine infrastructure, including the tailings storage facility, the process plant and related infrastructure, the entrance to the underground mine ramp and the administrative headquarters and drill core storage areas.258 The Claimant also contends that PRES acquired ownership of the real estate on which it would carry out its planned expansion and improvement of the main access road259; and also where it would sink the ventilation shafts for the mine.260\n\nTr.

The rock mechanics study carried out in 2004 in relation to the planned underground mine demonstrated that the mine would *not* be susceptible to subsidence, particularly given the bench-and-fill mining method chosen for the El Dorado Project.265 Empirical evidence, according to the Claimant, confirms this conclusion: the Minita deposits had already been subject to underground mining; the area over this mine did not suffer any subsidence during these historical mining operations, and it had not done so during the intervening period.266 As noted by Mr Ticay (of the Bureau), so the Claimant submits, subsidence in hard rock mines can generally only pose a risk when there are \"very unfavorable\" geological conditions *and* there is also mismanagement of the mining operations.267 The Claimant contends that no such factors were present at El Dorado. Notably, Behre Dolbear's expert reports (adduced by the Respondent) mention the issue of subsidence as a general matter; but these do not indicate if or how it could have been a risk for the El Dorado Project.268\n\nC-712: \"The title and legal authorization documents... cover only those areas of the project where surface disturbances related to the project will occur.\" (emphasis added by the Claimant); and C-713: implying that \"surface impact\" was the test that had been employed by the Claimant in preparing to apply for the concession.\n\nC-18 at 2-1, 5-1-5-2; Tr.

D4,865-866.\n\nBD1, para. 50.\n\n7.15.\n\nMoreover, so the Claimant submits, PRES' environmental impact study (EIS) contained a comprehensive assessment of all the other impacts that the planned mining operations could be predicted to have on the surrounding environment, including water sources, vibrations, noise and light pollution etc.269 MARN never rejected the EIS; and, in fact, the EIS received a favourable opinion from MARN's technical staff.270 The Respondent declined to cross-examine at the hearing Mr Mathew Fuller or Ms Ericka Colindres as oral witnesses (being respectively the EIS's author and the MARN technical officer in charge of reviewing the EIS). Even the experts engaged by the Respondent to assess the EIS for the purposes of this arbitration have never challenged the study's principal conclusion that all the impacts of the Project could in fact be satisfactorily avoided, controlled or mitigated.271\n\nCl.

Accordingly, so the Claimant submits, the PFS and its supporting technical studies expressly took into account the expansion of the project within the requested concession area. Thus, while the PFS only classified economically minable \"reserves\" for Minita and Minita 3, other deposits within the study area were analysed in the PFS and supporting studies.\n\nCt PHB, para. 11; Tr. D7.1901-1903; Cl. Cl. Pres \"Tribunal Questions\", Slides 4-8.\n\n7.17.\n\nWith regard to the exploitation of deposits other than Minita and Minita 3, the Claimant submits that account must be taken of the highly prospective nature of the requested concession area and the stipulated thirty-year term of the concession.273 A significant expansion of underground mining operations within the concession area may well have been feasible during this long period. Indeed, the Respondent acknowledged that 12.75 sq. km. was an appropriate size for the Claimant's concession in 2005, with full knowledge that the Claimant planned to expand its mining operations to cover numerous deposits within that area. The full extent and nature of the possible expansion could not therefore be accurately predicted by the Claimant or the Respondent as at 22 December 2004.\n\nCl. Op.

According to the Claimant, these are all deep underground deposits, characterised by the same geological conditions as those of the Minita deposits, which the Claimant could reasonably have expected to access through underground tunnels leading off the main ramp for the Minita mine.274 Moreover, the Tailings Storage Facility (\"TSF\"), by far the main source of surface impact, was designed with a capacity to accommodate increased production from additional deposits.275\n\nTr.

D2,523; C-590; C-611.\n\n7.19.\n\nIn conclusion, as regards the El Dorado Project, the Claimant contends that it met (with PRES) the requirements of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law, both as a matter of legal interpretation (as supported by its expert legal witnesses) and also as a practical matter. (The Tribunal returns to the testimony of the Claimant's legal expert witnesses in Part VIII below).\n\n***D. The Respondent's Submissions on Interpretation***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.20.\n\nIn summary,276 the Respondent contends that the legal requirement of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law applies to all surface property to be covered by the requested exploitation concession; that there is no limiting language in this legislative provision; it is not therefore limited to surface properties which the applicant's concession is to affect directly; and the requirement applies to both metallic and non-metallic concessions and also to both mines and quarries. The Respondent also denies that the requirement under Article 37(2)(b) is unconstitutional under the Respondent's Constitution, general principles of administrative law or other Salvadoran laws.\n\nResp Counter-Memorial, paras. 79ff; and Resp Rejoinder, paras. 98ff.\n\n7.21.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant's case on the interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) is wrong for three main reasons. First, the Claimant's interpretation is not supported by the text of Article 37 of the Mining Law, read as a whole. Two provisions in Article 37(2) of the Mining Law use the Spanish term \"inmueble.\" Article 37(2)(a) requires an applicant to provide detailed information, such as a location map, a technical description, coordinates and boundaries, for the \"inmueble en el cual se realizar\u00e1n las actividades\" or \"property where the activities will be carried out.\" Article 37(2)(b) requires that the applicant must prove ownership or authorization for the \"inmueble\" or \"property.\" Unlike Article 37(2)(a), this provision does not contain the qualifying phrase: \"where the activities will be carried out\" after the term \"inmueble.\"\n\n7.22.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant badly misinterprets Article 37(2)(b). It seeks wrongly to import the qualifying phrase from Article 37(2)(a) into Article 37(2)(b) even though the latter has no language qualifying the general word \"property.\" The Claimant also seeks wrongly to force a meaning upon the phrase: \"where the activities will be carried out\", being the language of Article 37(2)(a) that is not in the text of Article 37(2)(b). Even if the text of 37(2)(a) were applicable to the latter's ownership or authorization requirement (which it is not), there would be no basis for limiting the reference to \"activities\" to \"surface activities.\" The Claimant's interpretation ignores the fact that activities can occur both on the surface and underground.\n\n7.23.\n\nSecond, at the time PRES submitted its application to the Bureau on 22 December 2004, the Claimant (with PRES) understood the phrase \"where the activities will be carried out\" to refer to the entire area of the requested concession. In compliance with Article 37(2)(a) of the Mining Law, PRES submitted the coordinates and maps covering the entire area of the requested concession with its application, not just those parts where surface activities would take place. According to the Respondent, PRES' application with its description of the \"property where the activities will be carried out\" thus leaves no doubt that, for the purposes of that application, the \"inmueble\" or \"property\" under Article 37(2)(a) and by necessary implication also Article 37(2(b) was the entire area requested for the concession. The Claimant's own contemporaneous actions in submitting detailed mapping, coordinates and other information for the entire concession area in response to the requirement of Article 37(2)(a) demonstrate that the phrase \"where the activities will be carried out\" described the entire concession area of 12.75 sq. km requested by PRES and not just as small part of it.\n\n7.24.\n\nThird, the Claimant's submission, that the explicit requirement to own or have authorizations for the surface area of the entire concession requested should be ignored for underground mines, forces a distinction that is not found in the Mining Law. The drafters of the Mining Law could have distinguished underground mines from open-pit mines, but reasonably chose not to do so. Indeed, the drafters specifically defined \"Mine\" as: \"The physical place, whether at the surface or underground, where the extraction of mineral substances is carried out\" (Article 2 of the Mining Regulations). The drafters purposefully required ownership or authorization from all landowners in the entire concession area for either type of mine. Further, according to the Respondent, it is worth noting that, given the Claimant's \"preliminary\" plans and its desire to expand its operations after obtaining the concession, it was even impossible for the Claimant (with PRES) to have known on 22 December 2004 what surface property would be affected, physically, by its eventual surface works.\n\n7.25.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's case on Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law fails on the issue of interpretation, supported both by the contemporary materials and the evidence of its legal expert witnesses on Salvadoran law. (The Tribunal returns to the testimony of the Respondent's legal expert witnesses in Part VIII below).\n\n***E. The Claimant's Submissions on Estoppel***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n7.26.\n\nIn summary,277 the Claimant contends that the Respondent's conduct amounted to clear and unequivocal representations by the Respondent that Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law did not provide a legitimate or sufficient basis to deny PRES its requested concession for the El Dorado Project. The Claimant contends that, both as a matter of international law and Salvadoran law, the Respondent is estopped or precluded under the doctrine of *actos propios* from contending otherwise in this arbitration.\n\nCt PHB, pp 18ff.\n\n7.27.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent's approval of PRES' concession application was, after November 2005, at all times subject only to further actions to be taken by Respondent itself; that the Claimant maintained a legitimate interest in the concession at all times up to 10 March 2008; and that there was no legitimate basis to deny the concession to PRES. The Claimant contends that it relied upon these representations by continuing to invest in the El Dorado Project, thereby generating substantial benefits for the Respondent; and by not pursuing further actions in relation to the legal requirements for the granting of the concession (other than the requirement to present the environmental permit). By going against these representations, so the Claimant submits, the Respondent has unfairly betrayed the Claimant's legitimate trust in the Respondent.\n\n7.28.\n\nAs to facts alleged to support the Claimant's case on Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining law, the Claimants asserts the following, here necessarily abbreviated given that the disputed factual events have been addressed already by the Tribunal in Part VI above.\n\n7.29.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it understood from the time of its investment in 2002 that it would only need to acquire real estate where \"surface works were required.\"278 This understanding was in keeping with ordinary and prudent mining practice, and also with Pac Rim's reasonable understanding of what could be required under the Mining Law.279 On 22 December 2004, the Claimant duly presented documents with PRES' concession application to the Respondent, demonstrating PRES' ownership or authorizations over all surface real estate that would be used or occupied by its nearterm to mid-term mining operations, being a period which was co-terminous with that which could reasonably be expected to be disturbed by its proposed mining operations at El Dorado.280\n\nC-349.\n\nWilliams ER 1 at 15, 32-35; Williams ER 2 at 2-21; Rigby, paras. 102-03; Memorial paras. 561-76; Reply, paras. 377-404; Gehlen WS, paras. 123-28\n\nC-181; C-6; C-713.\n\n7.30.\n\nFollowing the submission of PRES' application, the Respondent informed the Claimant in March 2005 that it interpreted the law to imply that the Claimant must obtain authorization from every surface owner within the limits of the proposed concession area. The Claimant disagreed with the Respondent's interpretation.281 The Respondent took the Claimant's observations seriously: \"Given the importance of the matter, the Minister [of Economy] agreed to ask for an interpretation of the law from the Office of the Secretary of Legislative and Judicial Matters in the Office of the President.\"282 Indeed, notwithstanding the confusion over the requirement meant by Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law, the Claimant \"expect[ed] that this issue can be resolved\";283 and the Parties cooperated in seeking a resolution to that issue over the following months.\n\nsee, e.g., C-286; C-290; R-30 (attachment).\n\nC-290; C-713.\n\nC-712.\n\n7.31.\n\nFrom the factual record, so the Claimant submits, the Respondent clearly had doubts concerning the practical implementation of its own interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. The Respondent undertook to \"reach a consensus\" with the Claimant regarding \"what actions should be taken\"; and the Respondent determined that its own preferred course of action (with which the Claimant agreed) was to seek a legislative amendment to the existing Mining Law. Following the Respondent's communication of the proposed amendment to the Claimant in late October 2005284 and the Claimant's positive response285, the requirement of Article 37(2)(b) was never again mentioned in correspondence between the Parties, until late 2006.\n\nR-35.\n\nC-400; C-294.\n\n7.32.\n\nIn the meantime, in early November 2005, the Respondent represented to the Claimant that the Claimant (with PRES) was not required to take any further actions in relation to Article 37(2) of the Mining Law, including but not limited to Article 37(2)(b), since the Parties' preferred course of action was to be implemented by the Respondent. In reliance upon this representation, the Claimant did not take any further action in relation to the requirement of Article 37(2)(b) over the coming months. The Claimant continued reasonably to rely upon the Respondent's representation.\n\n7.33.\n\nIn February 2006, the Minister of Economy (Ms de Gavidia) informed the Claimant that it was \"the [P]resident's instructions to present [the mining law reform] after March 12 [2006] for reasons of election strategy.\"286 Then, in June 2006, the Respondent publicly announced a planned reform to the Mining Law, which would also include provisions increasing royalties and strengthening environmental protections.287 The Claimant supported this initiative in good faith. The Ministry of Economy continued actively to pursue it until at least the latter part of 2007.288 Throughout this time, however, it also became increasingly clear that the outcome of the legislative reform process depended upon the approval of President Saca.289\n\nC-295.\n\nC-301; C-409; C-410; C-395; C-206 Mem., paras. 306-14; Rep. para. 450.\n\nSee, e.g., Tr.

PHB, footnote 26.\n\n7.35.\n\nWhy did the Claimant, between March 2005 and March 2008, not obtain additional surface authorizations regarding Article 37(2)(b) when the legislative reform was delayed? The Claimant's answer is that the Respondent had represented to the Claimant that no further action was necessary on the Claimant's part in relation to any such authorizations; and the Respondent's representation that legislative reform was its preferred course was continually re-affirmed by the Respondent to the Claimant until the *de facto* mining ban on 10 March 2008. The Claimant contends that it was at all times reasonable for the Claimant to rely upon the Respondent's representation that the Claimant was not required to take further action in relation to Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.\n\n7.36.\n\nThe Claimant refutes the Respondent's case that it was unreasonable for the Claimant to act in reliance upon any promise of legislative reform made by the Respondent's executive branch.292 The Claimant does not rely upon the promise of legislative reform by the executive branch as the basis for its estoppel. Rather, the Claimant submits that the Respondent is estopped from arguing that the Claimant had not done everything that was required or expected of it in relation to the issue over surface rights under Article 37(2)(b). According to the Claimant, this estoppel arises not from a promise of legislative reform by the Legislative Assembly, but rather from a representation that such reform was the Respondent's preferred course of action, thus requiring no further action from the Claimant. According to the Claimant, there was nothing illegal (or even out of the ordinary) about such representation by the Respondent.\n\nTr. D7.1997-1998.\n\n7.37.\n\nThe Claimant's further case on estoppel is that the Respondent's conduct amounted to a representation that Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law did not provide any legitimate or sufficient basis for the Respondent to deny the concession to the Claimant. To that end, the Claimant invokes the following matters.\n\n7.38.\n\nAs of November 2005, according to the Claimant, it understood that legislative reform was the Respondent's preferred course of action in relation to surface rights under Article 37(2)(b); it reasonably expected this reform to be made by the legislature; but, if the reform had not come to fruition, the Claimant would not have been deprived of its ability to obtain the concession. The Respondent represented to the Claimant at all times after November 2005 that the surface rights issue was not the critical path for the concession. Following that date, according to the Claimant, the evidential record demonstrates that the Parties continued to communicate frequently and at all levels about two other significant matters: the approval of the pending environmental permit and the importance of concluding legislative reforms to increase environmental protections and achieve the administration's other goals. The issue over the surface rights issue under Article 37(2)(b) was never again mentioned between them.\n\n7.39.\n\nThroughout this same time period, according to the Claimant, the Respondent continued to engage in conduct that gave all appearances of a continuing legal relationship with the Claimant under the Mining Law in relation to the area of the concession application. These included (*inter alia*): the formal presentation and acceptance of annual reports that were submitted to the Bureau, \"in order to 100% justify [the Claimant's] presence in the El Dorado Mining Area\";293 field inspections by the Bureau to \"verify\" the Claimant's continued activities in the area;294 other correspondence between the Claimant and the Bureau concerning the Claimant's activities at El Dorado and how they would be carried out in the future295; and visits to the Project site by members of the Salvadoran legislature.296 The Claimant submits that these activities alone amounted to a clear and unequivocal representation by the Respondent that, at the very least, the Claimant (with PRES) maintained legal rights in the El Dorado Project and had a legitimate interest in the granting of the concession by the Respondent. The Claimant refutes the Respondent's contention that all this was illegal under the Mining Law.297\n\nC- 680, Introduction; C-351, Introduction; R-100, Introduction; cf. R-102, Introduction.\n\nC-684; C-683; C-682.\n\nC-685; C- 686; C-687; C-688; Gehlen WS paras. 157-60.\n\nC-509; Garcia WS, para. 60.\n\nTr. D7.1959-1961.\n\n7.40.\n\nIn these circumstances, according to the Claimant, the Respondent's resounding silence with regard to the issue of surface rights under Article 37(2)(b) amounted to a clear representation by the Respondent that the issue did not provide a legitimate or sufficient basis to impede the Claimant's development of the El Dorado Project as a concession.\n\n7.41.\n\nMoreover, so the Claimant submits, it was reasonable for the Claimant to rely upon this representation because there were various other legitimate pathways by which the issue of surface rights could ultimately have been resolved, such that the Claimant's development of the El Dorado Project could move forward. Most easily, the Respondent could have advised the Claimant to take further specific actions to conform its application to the Bureau's initial interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. The Claimant contends, it would have taken such actions had it been advised to do so. There were also other pathways.\n\n7.42.\n\nFirst, in May 2006, just weeks before the legislative reform initiative commenced in earnest within the Legislative Assembly, the Claimant was willing and able to pursue a plan whereby the Claimant would obtain \"authorization\" from additional surface landowners.298 However, the Claimant did not know what such \"authorization\" could entail until it received further guidance from the Respondent (which were not forthcoming).299\n\nC-711.\n\nC-291; Tr. D2,331, 509-510; Shrake 2 WS, para. 111; Gehlen WS, paras. 190-94; Jur Tr. 439-443.\n\n7.43.\n\nSecond, the Claimant was prepared to reduce the size of the requested concession to the surface area where it could obtain legal rights, had that ultimately been the path it was required or advised to take by the Respondent.300 Indeed, the Claimant already owned all the real estate overlying the B\u00e1lsamo and Cerro Alto deposits.301 The Claimant could and would have purchased or leased the real estate overlying the Minita deposits.302 Moreover, the real estate overlying the South Minita deposit was almost entirely owned by the same large landowner from whom the Claimant had already leased the real estate for the planned TSF and processing plant, and with whom the Claimant continued to maintain excellent relations.303 Thus, while it was obviously not the Claimant's preference substantially to reduce the size of the requested concession, there is no reason to think that development of the project could not have gone forward if the concession had been reduced to lesser surface areas than the Claimant was willing and able to lease or purchase outright.\n\nShrake 1 WS, para. 86; Juris Tr. 438-440; Tr. D2,366 & 369.\n\nC-32 at 2; (According to the Claimant, this shows the B\u00e1lsamo deposit underlying the TSF, the entire surface area of which is undisputedly owned by the Claimant; and the Cerro Alto deposit is immediately parallel to B\u00e1lsamo and also underlying the TSF).\n\nGehlen WS, paras. 188-93; Tr. D2,369-370; C-6; C-11; C-609; C-648; C-649; C-660; C-661.\n\nTr. D2,369-370.\n\n7.44.\n\nThird, so the Claimant submits, the Respondent might have applied the requirement differently from the manner in which the Bureau had initially interpreted the requirement of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. There is no reason why the Respondent could not have legitimately done so. Substantial legal expert testimony has been adduced in relation to this requirement in this arbitration. The meaning of Article 37(2)(b) is not clear and unambiguous. The Claimant's legal expert witnesses have advanced reasonable alternative interpretations of Article 37(2)(b), which are in harmony under Salvadoran law with the constitutional principle of proportionality, systematic interpretation and the stated purpose of the Mining Law.304 Not only could the Bureau have legitimately changed its initial interpretation of Article 37(2)(b), the Claimants submits that it should have done so.\n\nSee, e.g., Williams ER 1 at 32-35; Wiliams 2 at 2-21; Fermandois 2 at 57-65.\n\n7.45.\n\nLastly, the Claimant contends that the Respondent confirmed to the Claimant that it had no basis to deny its concession application on 18 December 2006; namely, that the surface rights issue was not considered to be a sufficient or legitimate basis not to approve the Claimant's application.305\n\nR-4, C-11, R-6; Reply, paras. 347-54/\n\n7.46.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant submits that, even if its case on Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law does not succeed on the first sub-issue of legal interpretation, the Claimant should nonetheless prevail on the second sub-issue of estoppel or *actos propios* under international law or, alternatively, Salvadoran law.\n\n***F. The Respondent's Submissions on Estoppel***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n7.47.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent contends that, under Salvadoran law as the applicable law, a specific legal act is required to invoke the doctrine of *actos propios* (as with estoppel). That act must be clear and unequivocal; there can no doubt as to the actor's intent; and the act must accord with the existing law.306 An officer of the Government would thus have no power to offer something to the Claimant (or PRES) that was not allowed by the law.\n\nRPHB, paras. 56-58.\n\n7.48.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that, on the evidence, the Claimant has failed to identify and prove any such act. In particular, so the Respondent submits, the Ministry of Economy's efforts to accommodate the Claimant cannot support any estoppel: these were not unequivocal acts and, in any event, the Ministry's officers could not excuse the Claimant from complying with the existing requirements of the Mining Law.\n\n7.49.\n\nTo the contrary, according to the Respondent, the Respondent's executive branch consistently interpreted Article 37(2)(b) as applying to the entire surface area of the exploitation concession requested by the Claimant. The Claimant's contrary case, so the Respondent submits, ignores the many documents showing what its officers and officials actually believed at the time; the Minister of Economy's explanation that she considered amending the law solely to help the Claimant; and the fact that the proposed legislative amendment was never enacted by the Legislative Assembly, leaving unchanged the existing Mining Law.\n\n7.50.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that there was never any doubt that the Mining Law required ownership or authorization for the entire surface area of the requested concession. The issue that the Ministry of Economy considered was whether that legal requirement could be amended by the Legislative Assembly, as the Claimant advocated, for underground mines. As the Claimant well understood at the time, this change would be for the Claimant's benefit and not for the Respondent. The Respondent submits that the Claimant's case on the Ministry's motivation finds no support and is, in fact, flatly contradicted by the evidential record. It is also unsustainable given the Claimant's failure to present in this arbitration any testimony from Mr Earnest, the Claimant's representative responsible for dealing with all communications with the Bureau regarding the relevant legal requirements from 2004 until late 2006.\n\n7.51.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Claimant cannot sustain its assertion that, as of October 2005, the Claimant had reached an agreement with the Ministry of Economy that the requirement of Article 37(2)(b) would not be used as a basis to prevent the conversion of PRES' exploration licenses into an exploitation concession. The Claimant's own PowerPoint presentation of May 2006 belies this assertion, stating that the Claimant's concession application needed a \"change of mining law (Plan A) or 'authorization' of surface landowners (Plan B).\"307 The Power Point presentation confirms that, in mid-2006, the Claimant still knew that it had either to procure a change in the existing law or to obtain the required authorizations or ownerships. There was no agreement with or \"act\" by the Respondent otherwise.\n\nC-711.\n\n7.52.\n\nThe Claimant is also wrong, so the Respondent submits, to contend that in June 2006 onwards (to 2007) the position changed, with conversations between the Claimant and the Ministry of Economy regarding reforms to the Mining Law. The Respondent asserts, to the contrary, that: (i) the Respondent's executive branch had indeed considered amending the law in 2005, but that effort went nowhere. Later efforts to change the law in 2007 were driven by the Claimant; (ii) the Claimant assigns undue importance to its own internal emails and conversations, as indicating what it was that the Respondent's executive branch was communicating to the Claimant and what the Claimant understood; and (iii) the Claimant thereby ignores the many direct communications from the Respondent's executive branch in 2005 and 2006 informing the Claimant that it had to comply with the requirements of the Mining Law. The Claimant's internal communications cannot therefore form the basis of any unequivocal representations from the Respondent, as alleged by the Claimant.\n\n7.53.\n\nFor example, according to the internal weekly activity summary for June 2006 cited by the Claimant, mining law reform was shown as \"taking off.\" The Claimant had a meeting with (*inter alios*) the Vice President and the Minister of Economy. At that meeting, Mr Shrake (for the Claimant) proposed that the Mining Law needed to be improved. The Claimant's own contemporary documents show that the Claimant knew that it had to devote more efforts from June 2006 onwards in order to convince the Respondent to change the law. There is nothing in these internal documents, so the Respondent concludes, that even suggests and much less amounts to an unequivocal statement by the Respondent that the Claimant's application could be admitted by the Respondent's executive branch without complying with the Mining Law.\n\n7.54.\n\nThe true position was in fact the opposite. According to the Respondent, it was expressed in the direct official communication from the Bureau to PRES of 2 October 2006.308 It was the first warning letter notifying PRES that it had 30 days to provide documents missing from its concession application, in accordance with Articles 36, 37 and 38 of the Mining Law. According to Article 38, if an incomplete application is submitted, the applicant will be notified and given 30 days \"to correct the omissions;\" otherwise, \"the application shall be rejected and ordered archived.\"309 The Respondent contends that there is no way to understand this warning letter as anything other than as identifying defects in PRES' application of 22 December 2004. In fact, so the Respondent continues, by memorandum of 18 June 2005,310 Mr Fred Earnest had told Mr Tom Shrake exactly what such a notification would mean: it meant 30 days to provide the missing documentation or else the application would be rejected by the Respondent. Despite the obvious importance of this notification from the Ministry, Mr Shrake sought to deny in his testimony having ever seen its content before this arbitration.311\n\nR-4.\n\nRL-7bis.\n\nC-291.\n\nTr D2,353, 354 & 357.\n\n7.55.\n\nIn conclusion, on this second sub-issue of estoppel or *actos propios*, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's case on the factual evidence: (i) the Respondent denies that the Claimant relied upon any unequivocal statements by the Respondent; the Claimant's evidence is based, at most, upon on its own internal communications falling far short of the requirements of Salvadoran law; and (ii) the Respondent asserts further that all the Claimant's factual allegations ignore the official communication to the Claimant explicitly notifying the Claimant of omissions in its application and starting the 30-day deadline for PRES to provide the missing documentation. Either way, so the Respondent submits, the Claimant has failed to prove its factual case. As for the Claimant's submissions based on estoppel under international law, the Respondent denies the application of international law; but also that, if it did apply, the Claimant's case would likewise fail for want of factual evidence.\n\n7.56.\n\nFor these reasons, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's case on Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law fails both on the first sub-issue of legal interpretation and on the second sub-issue of estoppel and *actos propios*.\n\n**PART VIII: LIABILITY - EL DORADO - THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSES**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n8.1.\n\nIt is appropriate to consider separately (i) the first sub-issue of the legal interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law under Salvadoran law; and (ii) the second sub-issue of estoppel or *actos propios* under Salvadoran law and international law.\n\n***B. The Issue of the Interpretation of Article 37(2)(b)***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.2.\n\nAs to legal interpretation, the Tribunal's starting point rests on the two-stage process applicable to the Claimant's mining project at El Dorado, first as \"exploration\" in the form of the exploration licences and second as \"exploitation\" in the form of an exploitation concession, under the Mining Law.\n\n8.3.\n\nThe Parties' dispute concerns only this second stage, namely PRES's application for an exploitation concession under the Mining Law, having already qualified as an exploration licensee under the first stage. Under Article 9 of the Mining Law, a foreign person (being legally authorised to carry out commercial activities in El Salvador), who has proved its technical and financial capacity to develop mining projects, is qualified to acquire mining rights, subject to the Mining Law.312 There was at the time no issue as to PRES' status, ultimately owned and controlled by the Claimant, to make an application for a concession under the Mining Law (not until after this arbitration had commenced). Further, as the existing exploration licensee at El Dorado, PRES had an exclusive right under the Mining Law to apply for an exploitation concession within the area of its exploration licences at El Dorado.\n\nRL-7(bis).\n\n8.4.\n\nThe basic legal texts applicable to PRES' application for a concession are relatively uncontroversial (as are the linguistic differences between the Parties' English translations). Article 13 of the Mining Law provides: \"Licenses for mine exploration and mineral processing plant operations shall be issued by the Bureau by means of resolutions; exploitation concessions for mines and quarries shall be granted by means of Ministerial Resolution, followed by the signing of a contract in the form provided in this Law and its Regulations.\" Article 23 of the Mining Law provides (*inter alia*): \"Once the exploration is concluded and the existence of economic mining potential on the authorized area is proved, the granting of the Concession for the exploitation and utilization of minerals shall be requested; which Concession will be verified through an Accord with the Ministry [of Economy], followed by the granting of a Contract between the Ministry and the Holder, for a thirty (30) year term, which may be extended if the interested party requests it, if in the judgment of the Department [of Mines: i.e. the Bureau] and the Ministry, the requisites established by this Law are fulfilled.\" Article 24 of the Mining Law requires the mining concession to be granted by the Ministry of Economy to be \"located inside the area indicated in the Exploration License; and its surface area shall be granted based on the magnitude of the deposit or deposits, and the technical justifications given by the Concession Holder.\"313\n\nRL-7(bis).\n\n8.5.\n\nUnder Article 37(2) of the Mining Law, already fully cited above in Parts II and VII, the application for an exploitation concession to be granted by the Ministry of Economy must be accompanied by (*inter alia*) the following documentation:\n\n\"(a) Plot plan of the property where the activities will be carried out, a cartographic map of the area, topographic plan and its respective technical description, extension of the requested area where its location, boundaries and name of bordering properties are irrefutably established;\n\n(b) The ownership deed of the property or the authorization legally granted by the owner;... [or, as differently translated into English, the property title for the real estate or authorized permission, in legal form, from the landowner];\"314\n\nIn the original text, this provision reads: \"Escritura de propiedad del inmueble o autorizaci\u00f3n otorgada en legal forma por el propietario;...\"\n\n8.6.\n\nThis statutory language imposes a mandatory obligation on the applicant under the Mining Law to produce the documentation as to ownership or authorization regarding the property (i.e. \"*shall*. be submitted\"). It is thus a legal pre-condition to the admissibility of the application submitted by an applicant to the Bureau for an exploitation concession under the Mining Law.\n\n8.7.\n\nThe Bureau is not the sole judge of the admissibility of an application. As already indicated, Article 7 of the Mining Regulations, entitled \"Jurisdiction\", provides: \"The Mining License or Concession Holders, whether national or foreign, are subject to the Laws, Courts, Judges and Authorities of the Republic; consequently, any conflict arising with interested parties or third parties, in relation to or because of the mining rights, which are unable to be resolved by mutual agreement, shall be decided in the corresponding Courts, the judgment of which shall be binding upon them. If the conflict is between the Holder and the State, stemming from the application, interpretation, performance or termination of a mining concession contract unable to be resolved by mutual agreement in accordance with the Law, it must be submitted to the competent courts of San Salvador.\"315 Article 7 of the Mining Law, in similar terms, subjects holders of mining licences and concessions to the jurisdiction of the Courts of San Salvador. Thus, PRES, as a holder of exploration licences and applicant for an exploitation licence, had a legal remedy to address any perceived wrong by the Bureau over its application for an exploitation concession before the Salvadoran Courts in the event that the Bureau (or the Ministry of Economy) misconstrued or improperly exercised their powers under Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. (This legal remedy stands legally apart from the Claimant's own remedy under Article 15(a) of the Investment Law giving rise to this arbitration, as separately considered in Part V above).\n\nRL-8(bis); see also CLA-6\\_translation.\n\n8.8.\n\nAt the Claimant's direction, PRES applied for an exploitation concession under the Mining Law on 22 December 2004.316 As to the \"requisites\", or statutory requirements for an exploitation concession under Article 23 of the Mining Law, it is the Claimant's case that, as a result of the Respondent's wrongful acts or omissions to act, PRES was not granted the exploitation concession to which it was legally entitled and which it legitimately expected to receive under the Mining Law: the Claimant contends that \"PRES has met all of the requirements to receive the concession\" [apart from the environmental permit].317\n\nR-2.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 65.\n\n8.9.\n\nAs to that environmental permit, the Claimant alleges that the permit was unreasonably withheld by the Respondent, namely by its Ministry of Environment (\"MARN\"). That raises a separate and distinct issue which does not arise for consideration under Article 37(2)(b of the Mining Law; and, as already indicated above, that issue is here set aside by the Tribunal for the purpose of this Award.\n\n8.10.\n\nThe Tribunal here turns to the different statutory requirement, alleged by the Respondent never to have been met by PRES, as to its property rights in the surface area of the exploitation concession requested of the Respondent, under Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law.318 Under Article 103 of the 1983 Constitution, the right to private property in the social interest is guaranteed; but \"[t]he subsoil belongs to the State, which may grant concessions for its exploitation.\"319 The State's ownership of the subsoil (including mineral deposits) is confirmed in Article 2 of the Mining Law and Article 7(b) of the Investment Law. Hence, the Respondent's allegation does not relate to ownership or possession of the sub-surface of the area of the exploitation concession requested by PRES. It concerns only private property rights at the surface.\n\nCLA-5.\n\nRL-121(bis).\n\n8.11.\n\nThe Parties' dispute raises threshold issues of legal interpretation. The first is whether the requirements of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law apply to the full surface area of the requested concession. The second is whether Article 37(2)(b) applies to any mining concessions, as opposed to quarries or open-pit mines. The latter, being open excavations, must inevitably interfere with the use and enjoyment by occupiers of the surface-land. On the other hand, underground mining, depending on certain factors, need not do so.\n\n8.12.\n\nIt is common ground that the disputed interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) is a matter of Salvadoran law. At the time (before this arbitration), two distinct opinions emerged as to the correct scope of Article 37(2)(b). The Claimant and PRES saw no good sense or rational purpose in having its scope extend to the full surface area of an underground mine, whilst the Respondent (by the Bureau and the Ministry of Economy) interpreted the statutory wording more literally: it applied to underground mining and to the full surface area of the requested concession.\n\n8.13.\n\nYet, the Respondent's officers were at one in seeking consistently to apply the correct legal interpretation of Article 37(2)(b), whatever that interpretation might be. As Mr Shrake frankly acknowledged at the jurisdiction hearing, the Claimant never received any assurances from the Respondent's several officers that PRES's concession application would be approved by the Respondent if the application did *not* comply with the existing laws of the Respondent, correctly interpreted.320 Conversely, there is no evidence before this Tribunal that either the Claimant or PRES ever requested the Respondent (including the Bureau and the Ministry of Economy) to ignore whatever Article 37(2)(b) required, correctly interpreted (subject to legislative amendment).\n\nTr. Juris D2,472-473.\n\n8.14.\n\nMoreover, Article 16 of the Mining Law expressly prohibited any departure from the Mining Law: \"It is forbidden to carry out the mining activities referred to in this [Mining] law without the corresponding authorization; anybody in violation of this provision shall incur the penalties established in this Decree [Law], without precluding the application of those set forth in criminal legislation.\"321 Article 69(2)(a) of the Mining Law classified as a \"grave\" violation: \"Performing the mining activities referred to in this Law without the corresponding authorization.\"322 Neither side were looking to commit or to be induced to commit, criminal offences under Salvadoran law on a permanent basis.\n\nRL-7(bis).\n\nRL-7(bis)\n\n8.15.\n\nThe threshold question was what was the correct interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law; and, as regards the Claimant, if that interpretation was adverse to its interests, could that part of the Mining Law be amended by the Respondent's legislature in a manner favourable to PRES's application for an exploitation concession. Given the facts recited in Part VI above, the Tribunal finds that this question was addressed by both the Claimant and the Respondent, from December 2004 to October 2006, in good faith and with mutual goodwill. There is no cogent evidence to the contrary.\n\n8.16.\n\nThe Tribunal has heard much expert evidence from the Parties' respective legal witnesses relevant, directly or indirectly, to this issue of legal interpretation. As described below, there were in all seven expert witnesses with 12 lengthy expert reports and a transcript of their oral testimony numbered in hundreds of pages. The Tribunal is deeply grateful for the scholarship and industry of all these expert witnesses. For present purposes, however, although the Tribunal has nonetheless considered their expert evidence in full, it will not be necessary to address all their points *seriatim* in this Award.\n\n8.17.\n\nThe Claimant submitted two expert reports on Salvadoran law by Professor Arturo Fermandois Vohringer, in addition to calling him as an oral witness at the hearing.323 Professor Fermandois is Senior Professor of Constitutional Law, School of Law, at the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile (the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]. He is also an attorney, Master of Public Administration (Harvard University) and a partner at Fermandois, Evans & Cia. He is not a Salvadoran lawyer. In his first expert report, Professor Fermandois testified that, whilst he was not an expert in Salvadoran administrative law, the existence of general principles of public law and administrative rules characteristic of Latin America, expressly included in the Constitution and legislation of El Salvador, provide tools, which so he believed, sufficed for his analysis of the legal questions addressed by him.324 The Tribunal is content to receive his expert opinions as helpful as to Salvadoran law on the issue of legal interpretation.\n\nFernandois ER 1 (dated 21 March 2013); Fernandois ER 2 (dated 4 April 2014); and oral testimony: Tr. D4,878ff.\n\nFernandois ER 1 5-6.\n\n8.18.\n\nThe Claimant also submitted two expert reports on mining laws by John Williams Esq, in addition to calling him as an oral witness at the hearing.325 Mr Williams is a practising attorney from Washington D.C., USA. He is not a Salvadoran lawyer. He has, however, extensive experience on mining laws as a consultant to (amongst others) the World Bank; and he has published many works on comparative mining legal regimes, including part of the Word Bank's *Mining Strategy for Latin America and the Caribbean* (1996). As a practical and comparative legal specialist, but not as a legal specialist on Salvadoran law, the Tribunal is content to receive his expert evidence, where relevant.\n\nWilliams ER 1 (dated 27 March 2013); Williams ER 2 (dated 4 April 2014); and oral testimony: Tr. D5.1226ff.\n\n8.19.\n\nThe Respondent submitted two expert reports on Salvadoran law by Professor Jos\u00e9 Roberto Tercero Zamora, in addition to call him as an oral witness at the hearing.326 Professor Tercero is a Salvadoran attorney, having practised for over 20 years; and he was also Professor of Constitutional Law and Administrative Law, Levels II and III, at the Universidad Centroamericana Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as from 2002 to 2005. The Tribunal is content to receive his expert opinions on Salvadoran law relevant to the issue of legal interpretation.\n\nTercero ER 1 (dated 9 December 2013); Tercero ER 2 (dated 20 June 2010); and oral testimony: Tr. D5.1143ff.\n\n8.20.\n\nThe Respondent submitted also two expert reports on Salvadoran constitutional law by Professor Albino Arturo Tinetti Quite\u00f1o (known as Jos\u00e9 Albino Tinetti), in addition to calling him as an oral witness at the hearing.327 Professor Tinetti has a doctorate in Jurisprudence and Social Sciences and a degree as a Master of Education. He is the Dean of Jurisprudence at the Superior School of Economy and Business (ESEN) in El Salvador, where he has been teaching constitutional law since 2003. He has also been the Director of the Legal Training School of El Salvador. He is, of course, a Salvadoran lawyer. The Tribunal is content to receive his expert opinions on Salvadoran law relevant to the issue of legal interpretation.\n\nTinetti ER 1 (dated 9 December 2013); Tinetti ER 2 (dated 20 June 2010); and oral testimony: Tr. D4.1001ff.\n\n8.21.\n\nThe Respondent submitted two expert reports on Salvadoran administrative law by Professor Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ayala Mu\u00f1oz and Ms Karla Mar\u00eda Fratti de Vega, in addition to calling them both as oral witnesses at the hearing.328 Professor Ayala is a former Professor of Salvadoran Administrative Law at the Universidad Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as, UCA, of San Salvador and Professor at the Universidad Pontificia de Comillas, Madrid. He is also an attorney and acted as Government Counsel of the Kingdom of Spain. Ms Fratti is a Salvadoran attorney. She has a Master's Degree in Constitutional Law from the Universidad de Castilla La Mancha, Spain and has been teaching as a Professor of Administrative Law for more than 10 years. The Tribunal is content to receive their expert opinions on Salvadoran administrative law relevant to the issue of legal interpretation.\n\nAyala & Fratti ER 1 (dated 20 December 2013); Ayala & Fratti ER 2 (dated 20 June 2014); and oral testimony: Tr. D4.1039ff & Tr. D5.1086.\n\n8.22.\n\nThe Respondent submitted two expert reports on mining laws by Mr James M. Otto, in addition to calling him as an oral witness testifying at the hearing.329 Mr Otto is an expert on mining laws, practising as an independent consultant in natural resources law and economics. Mr Otto is not a Salvadoran lawyer. As a practical and comparative legal specialist, but not as a legal specialist on Salvadoran law, the Tribunal is content to receive his expert evidence, where relevant.\n\nOtto ER 1 (dated 19 December 2013); Otto ER 2 (dated 24 June 2014); and oral testimony: Tr. D5.1372.\n\n8.23.\n\nLast, but far from least, the Tribunal has had the benefit of the three contemporary legal opinions, set out in Part VI above, from Mr Luis Medina (of 5 May 2005), Dr Marta Ang\u00e9lica M\u00e9ndez (of 25 May 2005) and the Presidential Secretariat (of 20 June 2005).\n\n8.24.\n\nThe basic facts relevant to the issue of interpretation can be shortly stated. At the time when PRES submitted its application for an underground mine to the Bureau on 22 December 2004, PRES did not submit any documentation under Article 37(2)(b) for the full surface area of its requested concession (12.75 sq. km), beyond that smaller area directly affected by its proposed infrastructure on the surface (being an area of less than 2 sq. km). That full surface area of 12.75 sq. km might have been reduced by PRES to a much lesser area; but it never was, for the Claimant's own reasons.\n\n8.25.\n\nWhilst it was always theoretically possible for PRES to procure the relevant documentation as to ownership or authorisations for the balance of the full surface area (over 10 sq. km), that would have been extremely difficult for PRES as a practical matter; and, even if practically possible, it would have required much time, effort and cost by the Claimant (with PRES). That was never attempted, not even as to any part of this balance, also for the Claimant's own reasons.\n\n8.26.\n\nIt is thus common ground between the Parties that PRES did not present to the Bureau documentation regarding ownership or authorisations for the full surface area of its requested concession at any time between 22 December 2004 and early March 2008. It is also, of course, common ground that the requested concession was for an underground mine and not a quarry or open-pit mine.\n\n8.27.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the Claimant and PRES genuinely believed, in good faith, that their proposed underground mining activities would *not* adversely affect any owners or occupiers of the surface area of the requested concession area (unless directly affected by the mine's surface infrastructure). It should not be overlooked that the Claimant's officers and employees included mining specialists of long experience and great expertise, especially Mr Shrake. In the Environmental Impact Assessment (or \"EIA\") of September 2005 submitted by PRES to the Ministry of Environment (MARN), Table 4.6-1 summarised the area to be occupied by the requested concession and, as to the sub-soil, it there stated in footnote 1: \"the underground mine has no impact on the surface. Source Pacific Rim 2004.\"330 However, whilst appropriate to record that here (given the controversies this case has engendered), the Claimant's own beliefs and good intentions are not directly relevant to the issue of legal interpretation under Salvadoran law.\n\nC-8A, Volume 1, Para. 4.6, footnote in Chart 4.6-1: Summary of the Area Occupied by the Project.\n\n8.28.\n\nIt is also equally appropriate to record here that, in the Tribunal's view, the Bureau and the Ministry of Economy, including especially Ms Navas and Ms Yolanda de Gavinda, were equally sincere in regard to the views they held as to the correct interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law, supported by the two legal opinions from Dr Marta Ang\u00e9lica M\u00e9ndez and the Presidential Secretariat. Similarly, however, their views and good faith are not directly relevant to the issue of legal interpretation under Salvadoran law.\n\n8.29.\n\nThe Tribunal has arrived at a particular conclusion regarding Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law for the purpose of deciding the Parties' dispute by this Award. However, the Tribunal's three members, in reaching that same result, have been influenced by three different factors, to a greater or lesser extent. One member finds the first factor decisive; another member the first and second factors; and the other all three factors. However, the members of the Tribunal are agreed as to the result, unanimously.\n\n8.30.\n\nThe first factor is acquiescence by PRES, with the Claimant. By 8 November 2006, as described in Part VI above, the Claimant (with PRES) had effectively put all their eggs in one basket: namely Plan A requiring an amendment by the Legislative Assembly to Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. By their own choice, as found in Part VI above, the Claimant and PRES did not pursue Plan B or any other plan. Further, PRES did not initiate legal proceedings against the Bureau or the Ministry of Economy, as it was entitled to do under Article 7 of the Mining Regulations (with Article 7 of the Mining Law), so as to test its interpretation of the statutory provision in a timely manner before the Respondent's Courts. That was again PRES' own choice. The Claimant and PRES maintained their choice for Plan A only, from November 2006 to March 2008. During this period, it is manifest that the Claimant and PRES acquiesced and accepted for all practical purposes the adverse interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) made by the Bureau and the Ministry of the Economy. They were confident that amending legislation would see them right. In this regard, they were mistaken. They were then left with only the adverse interpretation.\n\n8.31.\n\nThe second factor is the element of deference. As a general approach, deference should be given by an international tribunal to the unanimous interpretation of its own laws given in good faith by the responsible authorities of a State at a time before the emergence of the parties' dispute. There is a significant distinction to be drawn between an interpretation by the responsible bodies entrusted with governmental powers to be exercised at the time and non-authoritative interpretations, particularly when given by academic lawyers in a later arbitration. The former requires an element of deference, albeit that such deference does not preclude or exhaust the jurisdiction of an international tribunal. It operates only as a rebuttable presumption. Applying this factor to the present case, there is no sufficient reason to prefer the Claimant's non-authoritative interpretations, as opposed to the two legal opinions of Dr M\u00e9ndez and the Presidential Secretariat; and accordingly the Claimant's case on Article 37(2)(b) must fail.\n\n8.32.\n\nThe third factor is teleological. As a matter of language, the wording of Article 37(2)(b) is unclear. Read literally, it can be stretched to describe the full surface area of the requested concession. However, applied to underground mining conducted under modern mining practices (even if assessed as at 1995 or 2001), that literal interpretation does not seem to make much practical sense, whether viewed from the perspective of the proposed concessionaire, the Respondent (as the owner of the sub-soil) or the individual owners and occupiers of the full surface area. Equally, also as a matter of practical sense, it would unduly truncate the wording to limit its application to only that part of the surface area directly impacted by the proposed mining infrastructure at the surface. What matters, in practice, are the potential risks posed to surface owners or occupiers; and, inevitably, those risks may not be the same over the full surface area of the requested concession, particularly over the full 30-year period of the requested concession.\n\n8.33.\n\nThere were clearly potential risks from underground mining to the use and enjoyment of surface land within the full area of the requested concession at El Dorado. Mr Ticay (the Bureau's geologist) testified that the underground mining of the Minita vein, forming part of the requested concession area, meant that there was \"a potential risk\": \"This is an underground mine, and this may impair the surface because of a collapse, for example... Yes, there is a potential risk, if a mine, when it is technologically developed, well, if that development is not handled technologically correctly and the geological conditions are very unfavourable, there can be risk at the surface, perhaps there are collapses, there are problems with the aquifers and the water table, and this may impair the surface and the owners of the surface lands may be affected.\"331\n\nTr. D4,869-872.\n\n8.34.\n\nIn his expert report, Professor Tinetti testified that, in his view, it was constitutional to interpret Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law as imposing an obligation upon any person seeking to obtain a mining exploitation concession to submit documents evidencing ownership or legal authorization from the owners of the surface of the area to be included in the concession, even for underground mines \"because such activities may pose risks to the owner of the surface layer and to free, unobstructed exercise of the ownership or property rights.\"332 As to such \"risks\", Dr Tinetti testified:\n\n\"I have consulted the geology and mining activities experts retained by the State for this case about the potential risks that the owners of the surface could face if any mining activity were conducted in the subsoil, [footnote here omitted, but see citation below] and the following is a summary of the answers to my questions regarding such risks:\n\n(1) Surface subsidence.\n\n(2) Noise.\n\n(3) Vibration.\n\n(4) Underground explosion when gas is released.\n\n(5) Need to excavate an access tunnel if any miners were trapped.\n\n(6) Aquifer depletion.\n\n(7) Outcropping of the deposit veins to the surface, clearly disturbing the surface area on and around the vein. This is a consequence of using a diamond drilling program.\n\n(8) Infrastructure requirements, since it may be necessary to build ventilation systems, escape routes, expansion of internal conduits or others, the need for which will be known as opportunities arise throughout the production phase of the mine.\"333\n\nTinetti 1 ER, para. 62.\n\nTinetti 1 ER, para. 18\n\n8.35.\n\nProfessor Tinetti's footnote refers to part of the first expert report of Behre Dolbear (adduced by the Respondent). That report reads, in material part:\n\n\"[50]. There are a number of reasons for controlling the surface above the deposits and underground mine openings. A mining operation evolves over time and may need to use the land over the veins and mine for operational needs in the future. Other issues include potential subsidence, [footnote omitted] possible mining of the vein to the surface, blasting vibrations during operations, noise from ventilation fans that may one day be needed in the surface area, and road infrastructure for continued field exploration. In some cases, ground water above the veins may be diverted into the mine due to mining operations, which could impact farming and wells.\n\n[51]. In general, it is considered wise for the operator of a mine to secure control of all the surface lands encompassed by the operation through either purchase or usage agreements with existing land owners. Mine deposits can vary widely in type from non-metallic, such as coal and industrial minerals to metallic such as gold, silver, copper, lead, and other metals. Each deposit type may carry additional requirements than those general issues identified above for the El Dorado Project.\n\n[52]. For instance, an underground coal deposit may require more ventilation rises to the surface to remove explosive methane gasses from the mine for safety reasons during operations. In the event of mine rescue efforts to reach and evacuate trapped miners, additional mine openings may have to be driven, or drilled as rescue raises on those lands from the surface to reach those miners. Such a situation occurred in Chile several years ago, where underground miners were trapped for over a month until a rescue raise was drilled from the surface to their underground location.\"334\n\nBD 1 ER (dated 6 January 2014), paras. 50-52.\n\n8.36.\n\nProfessor Tinneti's approach is mirrored by the approach taken in Dr M\u00e9ndez' legal opinion of 31 May 2005, cited in Part VI above. That opinion likewise referred to the nature of mining operations posing \"dangers that may have an impact on people's lives, health or assets\"; the legal right to \"material security and legal certainty;\" \"the right to peace of mind, i.e. the right of each individual to enjoy the property that he or she owns without risks, disturbance or fears, or the peace of mind that the State will take the appropriate preventive measures to ensure that owners suffer no damage or disruption\" (paragraphs 5 and 8). It will be recalled that Dr M\u00e9ndez had been partly responsible in 1995 for preparing the text of the Mining Law.\n\n8.37.\n\nIn his oral testimony, subject to one important factor, Professor Fermandois agreed with Dr Tinetti upon the constitutionality of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. Professor Fermandois accepted that: \"it is logical to attempt to secure protection for the owners or owner impacted.\" His difference with Dr Tinetti at the hearing was based on the use of proportionality as constitutional factor affecting the issue of interpretation: \"... I accept that the requirement of consent of the owners who might be affected... as I said earlier, that all the owners who might presumably be affected with some degree of plausibility, must give their consent for the mining operations.\"335 This testimony at the hearing seemed to be a material development from the opinions earlier recorded in Professor Fermandois' written expert reports.\n\nTr. D4,990-992.\n\n8.38.\n\nThis constitutional principle of proportionality was addressed by the Supreme Court of El Salvador in its Judgment of 14 December 2004 (Ref 42-2003) as follows: \"It is possible to formulate proportionality as a just criterion for [establishing] an appropriate relationship between means and ends in the event of alleged infringement of fundamental rights by the authorities; in other words, for it to serve as a yardstick by which to control any excessive decision by comparing motive with consequences. It is therefore a barrier against interference by the authority in the exercise of fundamental rights by citizens. But it also constitutes a limit on the exercise of rights when in the scope of the same there is the potential to undermine or injure other constitutional rights, principles or values.\"336\n\nCLA-290, as cited in English translation in Reply, para. 399.\n\n8.39.\n\nProfessor Fermandois, whilst deploying the principle of proportionality so as to preclude the requirement of consent in respect of the whole surface area of a requested concession, accepted the legitimacy of required consent by surface owners and occupiers \"who *might* presumably be affected with some degree of plausibility\" by underground mining (emphasis supplied). In different words, this is the difference between the existence of a potential risk and the absence of risk. There is no rational relationship between \"means and ends\" (to use the Supreme Court's phrase) in applying the requirement for consent under Article 37(2)(b) to a surface owner or occupier whose use and enjoyment of surface land faces no risk from underground mining. Conversely, there is a rational relationship in regard to a different surface owner or occupier who faces a potential (or actual) risk. Professor Fermandois and Professor Tinetti both agreed that consents could be legitimately required under Article 37(2)(b) from those facing potential or actual risks, but not (at least as regards Professor Fermandois) from those facing no risks at all. Whilst incomplete, a material consensus was thus reached between Professor Tinetti and Professor Fermandois in their testimony at the hearing.\n\n8.40.\n\nGiven the potential risks of underground mining, the high population density of land in El Salvador, its historical susceptibility to generate social conflicts and the long-term 30-year period of statutory concessions stretching inevitably into an uncertain future, this consensus reached between the Parties' legal expert witnesses on Salvadoran law serves as a powerful guide to the correct interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. Both legal experts were impressive witnesses.\n\n8.41.\n\nSuch an interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) not only meets the requirements of the Constitution (as Professor Fermandois confirmed), but it also allows for a rational distinction in this case between different surface owners or occupiers who faced potential or actual risks from PRES' requested concession and those who faced no risks at all. This interpretation also removes the need, as asserted by the Claimant and certain of its expert witnesses (especially Mr Williams), to distinguish between underground mines on the one hand and quarries or open-pit mining on the other. The wording of Article 37(2)(b) must apply to all three, albeit limited to potential or actual risks as required by the principle of proportionality under the Constitution.\n\n8.42.\n\nIt would be possible to continue this analysis much further. The Claimant also invoked several other legal arguments based on systemic interpretation, semantic analyses of the Mining Law, the requirement for a bond under Article 14 of the Mining Regulations, the role played by voluntary and legal easements under Articles 53 and 54 of the Mining Law and a comparison between the several legal opinions of 2005 to support its case on the interpretation issue. The Respondent countered with contrary arguments pointing to a very different result. The Parties' two interpretations lie at opposite ends of the spectrum. In the circumstances, with the paramount principle of proportionality expressed by the Supreme Court of El Salvador, it would serve no purpose here to go through each of the Parties' other arguments and to reject them in turn.\n\n8.43.\n\nAs regards the application of this intermediate interpretation (as between the Parties) to the relevant facts, it must follow that PRES never complied in full with the documentary requirements of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law in support of its application for an exploitation concession at El Dorado. At the relevant time, PRES limited its compliance, on 22 December 2004, again in August 2005 and yet again on 8 November 2006, to that small area comprising the proposed mine's surface infrastructure. Whilst it is improbable that the full surface area of the requested concession was equally exposed to potential risks from underground mining, the risks identified by Mr Ticay, Behre Dolbear and Professor Tinetti included, inevitably, potential risks to parts of that full surface area for which PRES never presented the required documentation at the relevant time. Moreover, PRES took no steps to identify to the Bureau any such areas that were or were not subject to such potential risks. It adhered to the view that there were no potential risks at all. In this regard, it was mistaken.\n\n8.44.\n\nIn conclusion, taken alone or together, these three factors (particularly the first) are sufficient for the Tribunal to conclude that the Claimant's case cannot succeed in regard to Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law: PRES' application for an exploitation concession in regard to El Dorado did not and never did comply with the documentary requirements of Article 37(2)(b)of the Mining Law.\n\n***C. The Issue of Estoppel or*** **Actos Propios**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n8.45.\n\n*Applicable law:* The Claimant advances its case on \"estoppel\" or \"*actos propios*\" under both Salvadoran law and international law. The Respondent submits that the only applicable law for any form of estoppel or *actos propios* is the law of El Salvador.337 It is not therefore, according to the Respondent, international law. As to Salvadoran law, according to the Respondent, there is no concept of estoppel as such; but the Respondent relies upon analogous concepts to produce the same adverse result for the Claimant.338\n\nTr.

The Tribunal would only add, by way of explanation, that reliance in good faith includes reasonableness and, further, that a statement of fact can be made by a representor to a representee in several ways, including words, writings or conduct (or a combination of all three). However, whatever its form, the representation must be \"clear and unambiguous\" or \"unequivocal\", as appears from the second passage, cited from *Duke v Peru* (2008), at paragraph 249: \"... for the conduct or representation of a State entity to be invoked as grounds for estoppel, it must be unequivocal, that is to say, it must be the result of an action or conduct that, in accordance with normal practice and good faith, is perceived by third parties as an expression of the State's position, and as being incompatible with the possibility of being contradicted in the future.\" Whilst uncontroversial under international law, the Tribunal notes that this orthodox approach is confirmed by the recent award issued *In The Matter of The Railway Land Arbitration (Singapore v Malaysia*), where the tribunal rejected the claimant's case on estoppel for want of sufficient proof of any unequivocal representation by the respondent.346\n\n*In The Matter of The Railway Land Arbitration (Singapore v Malaysia);* Award (30 October 2014); PCA Case No. 2012-01 (Phillips, Gleeson, Simma); para. 199.\n\n8.48.\n\nThe Respondent also invokes the legal burden of proof to be discharged by the Claimant in making its factual allegations in regard to its alleged estoppel, both under international law and Salvadoran law. The Respondent contends that the Claimant has not discharged this burden.347 As the Party asserting estoppel, the Tribunal accepts that it is for the Claimant to discharge the burden of proving, on the evidence, the facts necessary to support its case on estoppel under both international law and Salvadoran law.\n\nTr. Day 7.1970.\n\n8.49.\n\nIt is necessary to recall the factual representations alleged by the Claimant. In its written pleadings, its case was pleaded on the basis of the Respondent's conduct between 2004 and 2008 that \"consistently confirmed that Claimant *was* entitled to the concession [original emphasis]\"; and it was also pleaded on the basis of the Respondent's representation by conduct (including silence) that Article 37(2)(b) did not provide any legitimate or sufficient basis for the Respondent to deny the concession to PRES.348 The Tribunal has examined in detail the Respondent's conduct towards the Claimant (with PRES) during this period, as set out above in Part VI. There is no cogent evidence that the Bureau or the Ministry of Economy ever represented to the Claimant, by any words or any conduct (or any combination of both), that PRES' application for a concession had met or would be treated as having met the requirements of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. To the contrary, the Bureau informed PRES from the outset (in March 2005) that it had not, hence the need for the three contemporary legal opinions and the proposed amending legislation. The Bureau did so again in August and October 2006. As to such a legislative amendment, whilst the proposal was supported by the Bureau, the Minister for Industry and also President Saca (until March 2008), there was never any representation by the Respondent's executive branch that the executive branch, still less the Respondent, would ensure that the Respondent's legislature would enact such an amendment. Indeed, the Claimant does not allege any such representation or promise of legislative reform by the Respondent's executive branch. It would have been manifestly unconstitutional; and if made, it could not reasonably have been relied upon by the Claimant in good faith.\n\nReply, para. 320.\n\n8.50.\n\nAt the hearing, as summarised in Part VII above, the Claimant put its case somewhat differently. It contended that the Respondent had represented to the Claimant that no further action was necessary on the Claimant's part in relation to procuring any further authorisations from surface owners and occupiers. Whilst both Parties were working towards a solution based upon a legislative amendment, there was indeed a benevolent acquiescence by the Bureau and the Ministry of Industry towards PRES as regards its deficiencies in meeting (as they saw it) the requirements of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. It was, moreover, a generous benevolence, not only in extending time to PRES from January 2005 to October 2006 to meet those requirements, but also in regard to PRES' continuing activities in El Dorado without any exploration licence or exploitation concession, as required under the Mining Law.\n\n8.51.\n\nHaving considered in detail the evidence regarding this alleged representation, as found in Part VI above, the Tribunal does not consider that all that was said and done by the Respondent (or not done or left unsaid) was ever sufficiently clear and unambiguous to support the Claimant's alleged representation. There is a much more simple explanation. From December 2004 to about September 2006, the Bureau and the Ministry of Industry wanted PRES' application to succeed, provided that PRES could meet the requirements of the law, whatever those requirements were. Whilst it still seemed that the Mining Law might be amended (as PRES required), this Ministry sought to help and accommodate PRES as best it could. There was however no representation by the Respondent that, if the law was not amended, PRES would be treated without more by the Respondent as having already satisfied the requirement of Article 37(2)(b) of the unamended Mining Law. As cited above, Mr Shrake's testified to the opposite effect: the Claimant never received any assurances from the Respondent that PRES's concession application would be approved by the Respondent if the application did not comply with the existing laws of the Respondent. The Tribunal therefore rejects the Claimant's conclusion that the Ministry's indulgence towards its drilling and other activities at El Dorado \"unequivocally demonstrate the Respondent's recognition of [PRES'] legal right to eventually obtain the concession.\"349\n\nReply, para. 322.\n\n8.52.\n\nAs regards Salvadoran law, it is possible to decide the issue succinctly. The Tribunal accepts the Respondent's case that its analogous doctrine of *actos propios* likewise requires, *inter alia*, a clear and unambiguous act by the Respondent and reliance in good faith by the Claimant. Accordingly, the Claimant's case on *actos propios* fails under Salvadoran law as a matter of evidence, as does its case on estoppel under international law.\n\n***D. Other Legal Materials***\n------------------------------\n\n8.53.\n\nIt is self-evident that the Parties and their expert witnesses struggled to find the correct answer, for the right reasons, to the issue of legal interpretation under Salvadoran law. Moreover, this was never an issue which, in the Tribunal's view, could be decided summarily, without the benefit of any factual or expert testimony on Salvadoran law. It thus could not be decided in the early stages of this arbitration (as the Respondent advocated); and, even if it could, the issue of estoppel (or *actos propios*), as to which a mass of disputed factual evidence was required for the merits stage, would have precluded any final early answer by the Tribunal.\n\n8.54.\n\nAs regards the Tribunal, in regard to the third factor above, it has based its decision on the issue of legal interpretation under Salvadoran law. However, the Tribunal has taken comfort from other legal materials lending support to that decision.\n\n8.55.\n\nThe Guatemalan Mining Law of 21 December 1993 contained a similar statutory requirement to Article 38 of the Mining Law. It provided:350\n\n\"Article 38. Requirements for mining rights applications. Mining rights applications shall be submitted to the Bureau... and shall meet the following requirements:... (i) Area requested, indicating location on original cartographic map or photocopy, with a scale of 1:50 000, or the scale which may be appropriate, preferably North-South, East-West orientation.... The application shall be accompanied by:. (3) In the event the applicant is the owner or holder of the designated land, certified copy of the document evidencing the ownership or possession of the land; otherwise, original or certified copy of the document containing authorization or consent of the owner or holder of the land subject to the application.\"351\n\nR-156.\n\nIn the original Spanish, this last passage reads: \"... en caso contrario documento original o copia legalizada que contenga autorizaci\u00f3n o consentimiento del propietario o poseedor del terreno afecto a la solicitud.\"\n\n8.56.\n\nThis provision in the 1993 Law was understood to mean, under Guatemalan law, that an applicant was required to submit documentation evidencing authorizations or consents from owners or occupiers of the *full* surface area of the requested concession. In 1997, this requirement was amended by the Guatemalan legislature. The amendment was explained in paragraph 4 of the 1997 Report from the Guatemala Commission of Energy and Mines, as follows:352 \"With the current legislation [of 1993], domestic and foreign investors have no motivation or interest to develop mining exploration and exploitation projects, since the law requires permission from the owners and holders of the designated land, Guatemala being the only Latin American country which has this requirement;.. [sic]\" As understood by the Tribunal, the Guatemalan legislature amended the 1993 Law to remove an applicant's obligation in regard to the full surface area of a requested concession. The Tribunal notes the Report's reference to Guatemala being the \"only\" Latin American country to have imposed such an obligation (as at 1997, after the Respondent's Mining Law of 1995). It attributes no material significance to this over-generalisation.\n\nR-157.\n\n8.57.\n\nMr Williams testified to the same effect: \"They [the Guatemalan legislature] changed the law and they eliminated the requirement to - that an Applicant for mineral rights would have to produce evidence of ownership of the land or the consent of the landowners in order - with their application for mineral rights.\"353 Mr Williams also confirmed that, to his knowledge, he was not aware of \"any other Latin American country that has that ownership requirement in its Mining Law.\"354\n\nTr. D5.1334.\n\nTr. D5.1336.\n\n8.58.\n\nThe Tribunal notes three factors in the materials regarding Guatemala. First, the Respondent's legal interpretation of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law had, at least, a respectable precedent in the legislative text of another Latin American State: the Respondent's interpretation was not therefore quixotic or perverse as applied to PRES in 2005 onwards. Second, the Guatemalan 1993 Law was amended by legislation in 1997: it was not modified by judicial or other interpretation; and the Claimant was therefore right to pursue, as its Plan A, a legislative amendment to Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. Third, the extreme requirement for consent for the *full* surface area of the requested concession is indeed awkward and out-dated for modern methods of underground mining.\n\n8.59.\n\nThe Tribunal has also taken some comfort from other comparative and historical materials. Whilst these further legal materials were not submitted by the Parties, it seems appropriate to describe them briefly here. The Tribunal stresses that none of these materials played any part in its decisions; but they may help the Parties to understand that the intermediate interpretation decided above, as between their opposite cases on legal interpretation, is not devoid of legal logic.\n\n8.60.\n\nThe starting point is the old and well-known Latin maxim: \"*cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos.*\"355 This was not a maxim in classical Roman law but, rather, in a later formulation, first recorded by the Bolognese scholar Accursius in Italy during the 13th century (whose son later lectured at Oxford University). It was restated by Cinus of Pistoia in the 14th century and later adopted by Blackstone (the English legal historian) in the 18th century,356 with others elsewhere.357 The maxim was readily accepted in many legal systems, both civilian and common law. It was traditionally used to assert that, *prima facie*, the rights of the surface landowner extended ordinarily both to everything above it 'upwards to the heavens' and everything below it 'downwards to the centre of the earth'.\n\nOften translated into English, as: \"He who owns the land owns everything reaching up to the very heavens and down to the depth of the earth.\"\n\n*Blackstone's Commentaries II* (21st ed) 1844), C.2, p.181: \"Land hath also, in its legal significance, an indefinite extent, upwards as well as downwards. *Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelom*. therefore no man may erect any building, or the like, to overhang another's land.. So that the word \"land\" includes not only the face of the earth but everything under it, or over it.\"\n\nSee: John G Sprankling, \"Owning the Center of the Earth\", (2008) 55 *UCLA L Re* v 979; Jean Howell, \"'Subterranean Land law': Rights below the Surface of Land\", (2002) 53 *Northern Ireland Legal Qu* arterly 268; Francis Lyall, \"The maxim *cuius est solum* in Scots Law\" [1978] *JR* 147; and Lord McNair, *The Law of the Air* (1964; ed. Kerr and Evans), p 97.\n\n8.61.\n\nIt is significant that, in these early times, it was generally thought that the earth was flat and not a sphere. In regard to the earth as a sphere, it is manifestly absurd to consider that a surface-landowner is entitled absolutely to \"everything below\", given that as such property rights approach the centre of the earth over 3,900 miles below the surface, that property must become infinitely small with an increasing number of neighbourly rights measured in millions. Moreover, no such property right could penetrate beyond the earth's centre without infringing like property rights arriving from opposite parts of the earth's surface. Conversely, a surface landowner entitled to everything \"up to the heavens\" would see such absolute property rights expand to an ever-broadening extent up to the nearest star, if not still further. The Latin maxim, literally applied upwards, would make every landowner occupy only the very tiny tip of a huge inverted cone or pyramid, stretching light years into the outer cosmos. That is also, of course, manifestly absurd.\n\n8.62.\n\nIt is also significant that, in these early post-classical times, the earth's geology was little known and that mining technology did not permit deep mining but, rather, only primitive excavations close to the surface of the earth, such as open or shallow mines, water-reservoirs and catacombs. Almost invariably, these excavations disturbed directly the rights of the owner or occupier of the land at the surface. It was only with modern mining technology that underground mining could take place without interfering with the adjacent surface. Conversely, whilst overhanging trees and buildings could disturb directly the rights of the surface landowner, it was only with the invention of aircraft that overflying a land surface could take place without the risk of such disturbance. In modern times, commercial aircraft flying high in the sky, still less orbiting satellites in space, do not usually disturb the rights of a surface landowner to use and enjoy his land.\n\n8.63.\n\nIn *United States v Causby* (1946),358 the US Supreme Court held that it was unlawful for frequent and regular flights of the US armed forces to fly at low altitudes over private land, causing loss to a chicken farmer. However, the Court rejected the suggestion that trespass would be committed by aircraft flying at higher altitudes. As expressed by the Supreme Court (Justice Douglas): \"The air is a public highway, as Congress has declared. Were that not true, every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suits. Common sense revolts at the idea. To recognize such private claims to the airspace would clog these highways, seriously interfere with their control and development in the public interest, and transfer into private ownership that to which only the public has a just claim.\" In *Bernstein v Skyviews & General Limited* (1978),359 the English High Court (Mr Justice Griffiths, later Lord Griffiths) decided that it was not an unlawful trespass for an aircraft to overfly the plaintiff's land at a height which in no way affected the ordinary use and enjoyment of that land and that, at such a height, the surface landowner had no property rights to prevent aerial photographs of his land: \"The academic writers speak with one voice in rejecting the uncritical and literal application of the [Latin] maxim.. The problem is to balance the rights of an owner to enjoy the use of his land against the rights of the general public to take advantage of all that science now offers in the use of air space.\" In *Didow v Alberta Power Ltd* (1988)360, the Alberta Court of Appeal in Canada took the same approach, adopting the reasoning of Mr Justice Griffiths. As regards celestial bodies in space, several international conventions effectively preclude the existence of private property rights under national laws.361\n\n*US v Causby* 328 US 256 (1946), 261.\n\n*Bernstein v Skyviews & General Ltd* [1978] 1 QB 479, 487-488.\n\n*Didow v Alberta Power Ltd* [1988] 5 WWR 606 at p. 613.\n\nFor example, the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies agreed by 102 States (including El Salvador), 610 U.N.T.S 2015; and the 1984 Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies agreed by 20 States, 1363 U.N.T.S 22. Under the Moon Agreement 1979 made by 17 States (including, but not the USA), there can be no private ownership of a property on the Moon. However, under the US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act 2015, the USA expressly disclaimed any \"assert[ion] [of] sovereignty or sovereign or exclusive rights or jurisdiction over, or the ownership of, any celestial body\" (Section 403)\n\n8.64.\n\nIt appears that these common sense approaches 'upwards' have not been similarly applied 'downwards' to the sub-surface by US, English and other Courts, although legal logic would require a similar approach. Professor Sprankling, in his 2008 article (see the footnote above), acknowledged that the 'centre of the earth' theory continues to prevail at common law before most US courts and in many US legal texts, subject to statutory modifications. However, in his proposals for a more rational theory at common law, whilst he accepts that a surface landowner should ordinarily enjoy sub-surface rights, he examines the question as to how deep into the earth should those rights reach, beyond the right of support. He dismisses the unqualified Latin maxim as poetic hyperbole (not law), blindly imitating the past; and he arrives at a downward depth of 1,000 feet (with an exception for mineral rights), by analogy to the demise of the *ad coelum* approach to airspace. Hence, according to this legal commentator, the surface landowner would have a legal interest in the subsurface to a depth of 1,000 feet, but no deeper.\n\n8.65.\n\nIn *Bocardo SA v Star Energy UK Onshore Ltd* (2011),362 the United Kingdom's Supreme Court decided that surface landowner has a legal interest in the strata beneath the surface up to at least 2,800 feet (being the depth at issue for diagonally drilled wells by the defendant), unless there had been an alienation of that strata by a conveyance, at common law or by statute to someone else (such as the State). Lord Hope held: \"There must obviously be some stopping point, as one reaches the point at which physical features such as pressure and temperature render the concept of the strata belonging to anybody so absurd as to be not worth arguing about. But the wells that are at issue in this case, extending from about 800 feet to 2,800 feet below the surface, are far from being so deep as to reach the point of absurdity. Indeed the fact that the strata can be worked upon at those depths points to the opposite conclusion.\" Earlier in his judgment, Lord Hope noted that anything drilled below a depth of 14 km would be crushed by the earth's pressure of 50,000 pounds per square inch and vaporised by a temperature of 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. It would therefore seem likely that Lord Hope would extend the protected depth beyond 2,800 feet (i.e. 853 metres), but certainly not to the earth's centre. At the centre of the earth, below the earth's crust of 25 km (at its thickest), the temperature exceeds 6,700 degrees Centigrade with pressure about 50 million pounds per square inch, making private property rights irrelevant.\n\n*Bocardo SA v Star EnergyUK Onshore Ltd* [2011] 1 AC 380, 399 [27] and 395-396 [19].\n\n8.66.\n\nMore recently, in several countries, the proposed use of lateral drilling for fracking (downwards) and low-flying private drones (upwards) have contributed to the academic debate; and certain legislatures (including the United Kingdom) have enacted legislation intended to derogate from the traditional legal position founded upon the Latin maxim now more than 800 years old. The United Kingdom's Infrastructure Act 2015, as regards fracking, precludes a surface landowner's property rights below 300 metres. This statute amends the common law position decided by the U.K. Supreme Court in *Bocardo* ; but it maintains the surface landowner's legal interests to a depth of 300 metres (equivalent to 984.25 feet)\n\n8.67.\n\nThese legal materials as to sub-surface interests confirm that the qualified Latin maxim, accepted by eminent scholars and courts over many centuries, is not the idiosyncratic feature of an isolated legal system. Equally, however, these materials confirm that the legal principle encapsulated in the maxim is subject to a pragmatic rule of reason which limits its application to cases where the particular height or depth of the alleged infringement is such that it could or might materially interfere with the surface landowner's ordinary use and enjoyment of that surface-land. In modern times, the old Latin maxim is qualified in its application; but the general principle remains, protecting the owner and occupier of the surface-land.\n\n8.68.\n\nIn the present case, the sub-soil is owned by the Respondent under Article 103(3) of its Constitution (as re-stated by Article 2(1) of the Mining Law and Article 7(b) of the Investment Law); and Articles 103(1) and 105 of the Constitution recognise the right to private property at the adjacent surface, including rural lands. Such rights include the reasonable use and enjoyment of the surface land by its owners and occupiers. The experience of Guatemala and the indirect influence of the qualified Latin maxim provide the historical background to Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. That background is consistent with the intermediate interpretation of Article 37(2)(b), applied to PRES's application for a concession. Accordingly, if and to the extent relevant, the Tribunal concludes that Article 37(2)(b), as here interpreted, is not to be regarded as an outlier from other comparative legal systems and traditions.\n\n***E. The Tribunal's Decisions***\n---------------------------------\n\n8.69.\n\nFor the reasons stated above in this Part VIII (A)-(C), the Tribunal decides the two subissues of legal interpretation and estoppel (or *actos propios*) adversely to the case advanced by the Claimant. The Tribunal addresses the consequences of these several decisions in Part X below.\n\n**PART IX: LIABILITY - OTHER MINING AREAS**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n9.1.\n\nThe Tribunal here addresses the Claimant's ancillary claims in respect of projects by DOREX and PRES (with the Claimant) for: (i) Zamora/Cerro Colorado; (ii) Guaco; (iii) Pueblos; (iv) Huacuco; and (v) Santa Rita. It will be recalled that the Claimant has expressly stated in this arbitration that none of its claims relate to any measure by the Respondent before 10 March 2008 (see Part 1 above). Hence, for these ancillary claims also, the Claimant does not invoke any wrongful conduct by the Respondent sounding in damages under the Investment Law or customary international law before 10 March 2008.\n\n***B. The Ancillary Claims***\n-----------------------------\n\n9.2.\n\n*(i) Zamora/Cerro:* As regards the two projects at Zamora and Cerro Colorado, there were no exploration licences granted to DOREX by the Bureau; but DOREX appears to have had a contractual relationship with a third party holding one or more exploration licenses under the Mining Law. The Claimant contended that these projects provided it \"with long term, organic growth potential.\"363 The Zamora project, begun by DOREX in February 2006, was located about 50 km north of San Salvador. The Cerro Colorado project, begun by DOREX in September 2006, was located about 10 km west of the Zamora project. (Neither was geographically contiguous with the El Dorado Project).\n\nMemorial, paras. 361 & 364, exhibits C-258 and C-425.\n\n9.3.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimant applied for permission to introduce new documentation relating to these projects. The application was opposed by the Respondent. The Tribunal was informed by the Claimant that this documentation comprised two documents: an option agreement and an amendment to that agreement. It was said that these could not have been submitted earlier by the Claimant in this arbitration, owing to unresolved issues of confidentiality with a third party.364 At the end of the hearing, the Tribunal reserved its decision on the admissibility of these two new documents.365 Having considered this disputed application more fully, with the further benefit of the Parties' post-hearing submissions, the Tribunal has decided not to admit this documentation, on two cumulative grounds. First, the Claimant's application was made too late; and, second, these documents could not materially affect the result of the Tribunal's decisions in this Award.\n\nTr. D2,551; D3,591-592; D6.1481-1483.\n\nTr. D7.2080.\n\n9.4.\n\n*(ii)-(iv) Guaco, Pueblos and Huacuco:* As regards Guaco, Pueblos and Huacuco, DOREX applied to the Bureau for exploration licences on 25 August 2005.366 Such licences were granted by the Bureau under the Mining Law on 28 September, 29 September and 29 September 2005 respectively.367 The periods of these licences were stated to be \"four years\", expiring by 30 September 2009. These exploration areas overlapped with the area of the former El Dorado exploration licences;368 and they were geographically contiguous with parts of the area of the El Dorado exploitation concession requested by PRES (as reconfirmed in August 2005).369\n\nGehlen WS paras. 110-112.\n\nC-43 (Huacaco); C-44 (Guaco); & C-45 (Pueblos).\n\nC-658 (Guaco); C-659 (Pueblos); & C-670 (Huacaco).\n\nC-288; Memorial, para. 210.\n\n9.5.\n\nOn 17 February 2006, DOREX submitted to MARN its EIA for a drilling environmental permit regarding Huacuco.370 On 7 and 17 August 2007, DOREX submitted EIAs to MARN for like permits regarding Guaco and Pueblos.371 On 27 November 2007, MARN requested DOREX to respond to technical observations on the Guaco EIA.372 On 9 January 2008, MARN requested that DOREX respond to technical observations on the Pueblos EIA.373 DOREX responded to MARN regarding Guaco on 11 February 2008 and Pueblos in March 2008.374 DOREX received no environmental permits from MARN permitting drilling under these exploration licences.\n\nC-185.\n\nC-216.\n\nC-199.\n\nC-201.\n\nC-202; Shrake 1 WS, para. 99; Colindres 1 WS, para. 173.\n\n9.6.\n\n*(v) Santa Rita* : The Santa Rita project, begun by PRES in or about June 2005, was located about 8 km north of the El Dorado project.375 PRES applied for an exploration licence also in June 2005.376 It was granted by the Bureau on 8 July 2005 under the Mining Law for a four-year term, which expired on 14 July 2009.377 This exploration area was not contiguous with the El Dorado Project. On 16 January 2006, PRES submitted its EIS to MARN for a drilling environmental permit regarding Santa Rita.378 The environmental permit for exploration was received by PRES on 9 June 2006.379 PRES began drilling in November 2006. On 13 December 2006, PRES announced the temporary suspension of drilling at Santa Rita following strong opposition from anti-miners.380 This suspension continued until late 2007, when PRES resumed limited exploration activities.381 Those resumed activities ceased in July 2008.382 As Mr Shrake testified: \"In July 2008, at my direction, PRES and DOREX suspended drilling activities in El Salvador.

The Claimant's Cases***\n-----------------------------\n\n9.8.\n\n*(i) Zamora/Cerro Colorado* : In summary, the Claimant contends that its interest in these projects formed part of its desire and support for a thriving mining industry in El Salvador and that, as such, these projects formed part of its \"portfolio of high-quality gold projects.\"388 The Claimant adduced expert evidence from FTI, who valued these projects at US$ 1.29 million as at March 2008.389 It is not, however, entirely clear to the Tribunal how the Claimant advances its case as to the Respondent's liability in damages regarding these two projects.\n\nMemorial, para. 364.\n\nReply, para. 480.\n\n9.9.\n\n*(ii)-(iii) Guaco & Pueblos* : In summary, having recited at greater length the factual record, the Claimant contends that on 1 July 2009, long after DOREX had submitted responses to MARN's observations relating to its application for the drilling environmental permit for Guaco and almost as long after DOREX had presented MARN with a second EIS regarding its application for a drilling environmental permit for Pueblos, MARN sent a letter to DOREX requesting certification of both the exploration licenses and the legal documentation regarding the ownership or possession of the real estate on which the exploration operations would be carried out.390 The Claimant contends that, as with the Claimant's other environmental permit applications to MARN, the regulatory process was being impeded by the Respondent's political machinations and not for any technical concerns regarding the applications, in violation of Salvadoran law (including Article 33 of the Environmental Regulations). The Claimant adduced expert evidence from FTI, who valued the Coyotera deposit in Pueblos at between US$ 37.12 and 30.26 million, as at March 2008.391 There seems to be no specific claim quantified for Guaco pleaded by the Claimant.\n\nC-204.\n\nReply, para. 480.\n\n9.10.\n\n*(iv) Huacuco:* In summary, having recited at greater length the factual record, the Claimant contends that the Respondent wrongfully failed to grant to DOREX a drilling environmental permit for Huacuco. It alleges that the permit \"became mired in the same political quagmire\"; and that, as a result, DOREX was never able to carry out the exploration operations that it had planned for Huacuco.392 The Claimant adduced expert evidence from FTI, who valued the Nance Dulce deposit in Huacuco at between US$ 9.17 and 7.47 million, as at March 2008.393\n\nMemorial, para. 347.\n\nReply, para. 480.\n\n9.11.\n\n*(v) Santa Rita* : In summary, having recited at greater length the factual record, the Claimant contends that this project was thwarted by the *de facto* mining ban announced by President Saca in March 2008. According to the Claimant, President Saca's decision openly to announce his opposition to mining made it clear to the Claimant that it could not advance its projects in El Salvador through any of the legitimate channels that it had actively pursued up until that point. What had in the past appeared to be inaction by the Respondent's executive branch, pending presidential approval, turned into an unlawful decision by the executive not to act: \"in short, a ban on metallic mining activities.\"394 The Claimant adduced expert evidence from FTI, who valued this project at US$ 502,424 as at March 2008.395.\n\nReply, para. 433.\n\nReply, para. 480.\n\n***D. The Respondent's Cases***\n-------------------------------\n\n9.12.\n\n*(i) Zamora/Cerro Colorado* : The Respondent contends that the Claimant (including PRES) has not presented any evidence that it has any exploration rights to these Other Mining Areas. Therefore, the Respondent contends, the Claimant cannot claim any compensation for a right it has not established under the Mining Law or the Investment Law.396\n\nRsp CM, paras. 179ff; Tr. D1,224fff; Tr. D7.1977ff;\n\n9.13.\n\n*(ii)-(iv) Guaco, Pueblos & Huacuco* : The Respondent contends that the Claimant, PRES and DOREX had no legal right under the Mining Law to obtain these new exploration licenses, because their areas overlapped with the areas of the expired exploration licenses at El Dorado. According to the Respondent, the Mining Law prohibited the Claimant and any affiliated company (such as PRES and DOREX) from obtaining new exploration licenses that included any areas of expired exploration licenses that had been held by any other company affiliated with the Claimant (namely PRES). Article 17 of the Mining Regulations prohibits a licensee from obtaining through another person another exploration licence over all or part of what was covered by an expired licence. It provides, in material part: \"Once the term of the Exploration License or its extension has expired, the Holder may not obtain directly, or through another person, another exploration licence over all or part of what the expired Licence covered.\"397 By operation of Salvadoran law, so the Respondent submits, there is therefore no legal basis for the Claimant to make claims regarding these licences in this arbitration under the Mining Law and the Investment Law.\n\nRL-8.\n\n9.14.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Claimant's case is not advanced by its deliberate use of DOREX as a legal person ostensibly distinct from PRES. The Respondent refers to Mr Earnest's email message to Mr Shrake dated 18 March 2005: We are going to have to form a subsidiary company to obtain new exploration licenses. It would be better if the new company didn't have Pacific Rim in its name. Any ideas?...\"398 This new company was therefore named DOREX.\n\nC-713.\n\n9.15.\n\nThe Respondent does not contend in this arbitration that these three exploration licences have been revoked or annulled by the Respondent.399 It submits that DOREX had no right to apply for or to receive these licences; that it never undertook exploration work in their areas; that it did not receive any environmental permit required for such exploration; and, further, that these exploration licences expired in 2009.400 It contends that DOREX acquired no right to any exploitation concession, nor any legal or property rights to any deposits in Guaco, Huacuco and Pueblos.\n\nTr. D1,228; Tr. D7.1982.\n\nTr. D7.1982.\n\n9.16.\n\n*Santa Rita* : The Respondent contends that this exploration license expired in 2009 with no allegation that the Respondent has impeded PRES' exploration of the area. Neither the Claimant nor its subsidiaries had any right to explore or to apply for a new exploration license after the Claimant allowed the initial exploration period to expire without having applied for a renewal. Thus, so the Respondent concludes, any such claims regarding renewal must be dismissed.\n\n***E. The Tribunal's Analyses***\n--------------------------------\n\n9.17.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses these projects separately, in turn. However, much of the factual and legal materials overlap between several of these projects.\n\n9.18.\n\n*(i) Zamora/Cerro Colorado* : The Claimant, by its two subsidiary companies, PRES and DOREX, was never a licensee for these projects. The Claimant (by itself or by one of its subsidiaries) had contractual rights with a third party in the form of an amended option agreement; but nothing more. In these circumstances, where the Claimant bears the burden of proving its case as regards liability, causation and injury, the Tribunal concludes that it has not discharged that burden.\n\n9.19.\n\n*(ii) Guaco:* Under the Mining Law and Mining Regulations, DOREX had no legal right to apply for this exploration licence from the Bureau because its area overlapped with the area of the former El Dorado exploration licences. Article 17 of the Mining Regulations so provided, as cited immediately above and more fully in Part II. It is not entirely clear why the Bureau and the Ministry of Economy was so accommodating to DOREX. However, at the time (August-September 2005), the Bureau and the Ministry of Industry were still actively concerned to assist the Claimant in regard to the El Dorado Project; and this exploration area was contiguous with the area of the requested El Dorado exploitation concession. By March 2008, however, that benevolent relationship lay in the past. It is also clear that DOREX would not have received from the Bureau any exploitation concession for any part of the area of its exploration licence at Guaco. Like PRES, DOREX would have had to confront Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law and, as with PRES under the same direction from the Claimant, DOREX would not have satisfied its requirements. Further, it is not clear what legal injury was suffered by DOREX resulting from the Respondent's conduct in regard to this particular project on 10 March 2008 or thereafter. As regards causation and injury, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not discharged its legal burden of proof.\n\n9.20.\n\n*(iii) Pueblos:* The same analysis as Guaco, as regards causation and injury, applies to Pueblos.\n\n9.21.\n\n*(iv) Huacuco:* The same analysis as Guaco, as regards causation and injury, applies to Huacuco.\n\n9.22.\n\n*(v) Santa Rita:* The available evidence as a whole is sparse. However, it shows that PRES faced intermittent difficulties from local communities at Santa Rita in 2006 and 2007, before President Saca's announcement on 10 March 2008. Moreover, whilst that announcement badly affected pending or future applications for exploitation concessions, it did not directly affect extant exploration licences. The reasons for PRES' departure from Santa Rita seems to have had much more to do with the demise of the Claimant's other projects in El Salvador, particularly its principal project at El Dorado. The consequential abandonment of the Santa Rita project by the Claimant is readily understandable; but the Tribunal does not consider that it resulted from any wrongful conduct by the Respondent towards this particular project under the Mining Law or Investment Law on or after 10 March 2008.\n\n9.23.\n\nAs regards the issues of extension and renewal, the Claimant allowed this exploration licence to expire without any request for an extension from the Bureau. Thus, under Article 27 of the Mining Law and Article 11(2) of the Mining Regulations, the Respondent was not legally required to grant any extension or renewal, as explained to the Claimant by the Bureau's letter dated 16 July 2009.401\n\nR-22.\n\n9.24.\n\nHence, as regards liability and causation, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not discharged its legal burden of proof.\n\n9.25.\n\n*Conclusion:* In these circumstances, in respect of these Other Mining Areas, the Claimant can have no claim for damages against the Respondent (at 10 March 2008 or later) under Articles 4, 5, 6, 8 and 13 of the Investment Law, the Constitution and (if and to the extent applicable) customary international law. The Claimant has not established its allegations as regards liability, causation and injury. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses on their merits these five ancillary claims as pleaded by the Claimant against the Respondent in this arbitration.\n\n**PART X: THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISIONS**\n------------------------------------\n\n***A. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n10.1.\n\nThe Tribunal here addresses the Tribunal's list of principal issues in Part IV above and the Parties' respective prayers for relief in Part III above as to jurisdiction and the merits. (The Tribunal addresses the issues of costs in Part XI below).\n\n10.2.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Claimant, as recorded in Part I above, makes no claim for damages under the Investment Law or customary international law in regard to any measure by the Respondent before 10 March 2008 (being the date of President Saca's alleged \"*de facto* mining ban\", publicly reported on 11 March 2008). In its own words, the \"Claimant is alleging damages only from the period from 10 March 2008 forward and not from any earlier period.\" It follows that, although the earlier period from 2001 up to 10 March 2008 provides an important factual background to all the Claimant's claims (whether by itself or with PRES or DOREX), that background does not provide the Claimant with any cause of action sounding in damages under the Investment Law or (if and to the extent applicable) customary international law.\n\n***B. Jurisdiction***\n---------------------\n\n10.3.\n\nAs to the first principal issue (\"Additional Jurisdictional Objections\"), as decided in Part V above, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's additional jurisdictional objections; and it re-affirms its jurisdiction under Article 15(a) of the Investment Law and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention to decide on their respective legal and factual merits the Claimant's claims and the Respondent's defences pleaded in this third phase of the arbitration.\n\n***C. Liability-El Dorado***\n----------------------------\n\n10.4.\n\nAs to the second principal issue (\"Liability - El Dorado\"), for the factual and legal reasons stated in Parts VI to VIII above, the Tribunal decides that PRES had no legal entitlement under the Mining Law to obtain from the Respondent and the Respondent no legal obligation to grant to PRES any exploitation concession for its El Dorado Project, owing to the continued inadmissibility of PRES' application of 22 December 2004 under Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law. In addition, PRES' exploration licences for its El Dorado Project expired on 1 January 2005 in accordance with the Mining Law. Accordingly, as at 10 March 2008, the Claimant (with PRES) had no legal right to any concession at El Dorado and no rights of property in any part of its sub-soil or any of its deposits under Salvadoran law.\n\n10.5.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Claimant can have no claim for damages as pleaded against the Respondent (at 10 March 2008 or later) under Articles 4, 5, 6, 8 and 13 of the Investment Law (including the Respondent's Constitution) as regards the El Dorado Project. Further, for similar reasons, the Claimant's claim for damages, as pleaded against the Respondent under customary international law (if and to the extent applicable) fails for want of any relevant legal right or right of property as at 10 March 2008 protected under Salvadoran law and international law.\n\n10.6.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's decisions regarding the application of Article 37(2)(b) of the Mining Law and its dismissal of the Claimant's pleaded claim for damages as regards the El Dorado Project, it is unnecessary here for the Tribunal to address further and decide separately the other issues arising under Article 37(2)(c) and Article 37(2)(d) of the Mining Law. It would unduly lengthen this already long Award and, whatever the answer, it could not affect the end-result of this Award. Hence, the Tribunal declines to do so. However, nothing should be assumed (one way or the other) as to how the Tribunal would have decided these issues, if it had been required to do so.\n\n***D. Other Mining Areas***\n---------------------------\n\n10.7.\n\nAs to the third principal issue (\"Liability - Other Areas), as addressed and decided in Part IX above, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant's claim for damages as regards (i) Zamora/Cerro Colorado; (ii) Guaco; (iii) Pueblos; (iv) Huacuco; and (v) Santa Rita, for the reasons there stated.\n\n***E. Damages***\n----------------\n\n10.8.\n\nAs to the fourth principal issue regarding quantum, it does not arise given the Tribunal's earlier decisions in this Award.\n\n***F. Interest***\n-----------------\n\n10.9.\n\nAs to the fifth principal issue regarding interest, it does not arise given the Tribunal's earlier decisions in this Award.\n\n***G. Legal and Arbitration Costs***\n------------------------------------\n\n10.10.\n\nAs to the sixth principal issue regarding costs, as already indicated, it is addressed in Part XI below.\n\n***H. The Parties' Respective Prayers for Relief***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n10.11.\n\nAs to the Claimant's prayer for relief recited in Part III(E) above, the Tribunal dismisses paragraphs (1), (2), (4) and (5). (It addresses paragraph (3) on costs in Part XI below).\n\n10.12.\n\nAs to the Respondent's prayer for relief also recited in Part III(E) above, the Tribunal dismisses paragraphs (1) and (4); and it grants paragraph (2) for the reasons stated above. (It addresses paragraph (3) on costs in Part XI below).\n\n**PART XI: LEGAL AND ARBITRATION COSTS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n***A. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n11.1.\n\nIn its Decision on Preliminary Objections (at paragraph 266(3)) and its Decision on Jurisdiction (at paragraph 7.1 C), the Tribunal made no order as regards costs, save to reserve in full its jurisdiction and powers to make any order as regards costs in an Award subsequent to these Decisions.\n\n11.2.\n\nDuring the last day of the hearing (on the merits), the Tribunal invited the Parties to file written submissions and reply submissions on costs by 21 November 2014 and 5 December 2014, respectively. Both Parties subsequently filed their submissions and reply submissions on the designated dates.\n\n11.3.\n\nBoth Parties request an order of costs in respect of both their own legal fees and expenses (\"Legal Costs\") and the costs, fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID in connection with this arbitration for which the Parties are jointly and severally liable (\"Arbitration Costs\").\n\n11.4.\n\nAs to its own Legal Costs, the Claimant's legal fees and expenses amount to US$ 9,971,503.47 (including a success fee payable in the sum of US$ 2.5 million). As to Arbitration Costs, the Claimant has advanced US$ 1,049,867.00 to ICSID as well as a lodging fee to ICSID of US$ 20,000 towards ICSID's administrative fees and expenses, and the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal.\n\n11.5.\n\nAs to its own Legal Costs, the Respondent's legal fees and expenses amount to US$ 11,910,696.00. As to Arbitration Costs, it has advanced US$ 1,050,126.30 to ICSID towards ICSID's administrative fees and expenses, and the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal.\n\n11.6.\n\nEach Party divided its costs into the following three categories: (i) costs relating to the preliminary objections first phase of the arbitration, (ii) costs relating to the jurisdictional second phase of this arbitration and (iii) costs relating to this merits third phase of the arbitration. The Tribunal refers to Annex 1 to the Claimant's costs submissions and the annexure to the Respondent's costs submissions for the relevant figures. It is unnecessary here to recite the relevant figures broken into these three phases: it suffices for present purposes to state that the relative proportions for the first phase \"Preliminary Objections\", the second phase \"Jurisdiction\" and the third phase \"Merits\" are approximately: 21%; 19.5% and 59.5% respectively.\n\n11.7.\n\nIt is necessary to explain these three distinct procedural phases, required under CAFTA Article 10.20.4 and the ICSID Convention. As was stated by the tribunal in *RDC v Guatemala* (2010) in regard to its own successive hearings, these distinct procedural phases are \"inconvenient, to say the least.\"402 The costs of this arbitration were substantially increased by these three separate phases.\n\n*Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/23, Second Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, Award (18 May 2010); footnote 2.\n\n11.8.\n\n*Arbitration Costs:* The total fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID's administrative fees and expenses are the following:\n\nProfessor Tawil Expenses: US$ 50,904.25 Fees: US$ 476,250.00\n\nProfessor Stern Expenses: US$ 38,324.71 Fees: US$ 336,000.00\n\nV.V.Veeder Expenses: US$ 67,729.96 Fees: US$ 403,500.00\n\nICSID Administrative fees and expenses: US$ 505,639.09\n\n*Total: US$ 1,878,348.01*\n\n11.9.\n\nThe Tribunal's fees and expenses, as well as ICSID's administrative fees and expenses, are paid out of the advances made by the Parties. As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to US$ 939,174,005 (being 50% of US$ 1,878,348.01).\n\n***B. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n11.10.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that: \"[t]he Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings and shall decide how and by whom these expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\"\n\n11.11.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1) provides that the Tribunal's Award \"shall contain [...] (j) any decision [...] regarding the cost of the proceeding.\"\n\n11.12.\n\nArticle 61 of the ICSID Convention grants the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n11.13.\n\nFor the purpose of deciding costs in this Award, in addition to the Parties' submissions of November and December 2014, the Tribunal has also taken into account the Parties' earlier submissions as regards the allocation and assessment of costs made in regard to both the first phase (Preliminary Objections) and the second phase (Jurisdiction) of this arbitration. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary here to address these submissions in full. It is, however, necessary to recall the Tribunal's approach on costs contained in its previous Decision on Preliminary Objections and Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n11.14.\n\nIn its Decision on Preliminary Objections, the Tribunal noted that the Respondent's request was the first application made under CAFTA Article 10.20.4 and also the first time that the expedited procedure under CAFTA Article 10.20.5 was invoked for a preliminary objection under CAFTA Article 10.20.4. As such, there was thus much to be learnt for all involved in this arbitration. The Tribunal concluded that the Respondent's Preliminary Objections could not be regarded as \"frivolous\" within the meaning of CAFTA Article 10.20.6.\n\n11.15.\n\nAs regards the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal considered that neither the Claimant nor the Respondent could be regarded as having either wholly succeeded or wholly lost their respective cases. The Tribunal decided that whilst the Claimant's CAFTA Claims could no longer proceed in this arbitration as a result of its jurisdictional decision, the Claimant's Non-CAFTA Claims under the Respondent's Investment Law could proceed to the merits of the Parties' dispute (as has occurred). The Tribunal concluded in that Decision that: \"the eventual result of the Non-CAFTA Claims on the merits may provide a highly relevant factor to any decision as to the final allocation of legal and arbitration costs between the Parties\": see paragraph 6.80.\n\n11.16.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it has a broad discretion as to the award of costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j). In the Tribunal's view, the following factors in this case are relevant to the exercise of such discretion.\n\n11.17.\n\nFirst, as noted above, the Tribunal has decided that the Respondent is to be considered as the prevailing party in the merits phase of this arbitration. Second, as already indicated, the Tribunal decided in its Decision on Jurisdiction that neither Party could be considered as having prevailed overall. Third, as also indicated, whilst the Claimant's case prevailed over the Respondent's case under the Tribunal's Decision on Preliminary Objections, it was perhaps, as the Duke of Wellington might have put it (as he did of the Battle of Waterloo), a \"near-run thing\" with consequences for this third phase on the merits. Lastly, the Claimant's case prevailed over the Respondent's case on the latter's Additional Jurisdictional Objections.\n\n11.18.\n\nIn the exercise of its discretion as to Legal Costs, the Tribunal has decided to reject in full the Claimant's claim for its Legal Costs against the Respondent and to order the Claimant to pay to the Respondent a proportion of its Legal Costs in the total amount of US$ 8 million.\n\n11.19.\n\nIn the exercise of its separate discretion as to Arbitration Costs, the Tribunal has decided to reject both Parties' claims for Arbitration Costs *inter se*, ordering each Party to bear its own share of Arbitration Costs.\n\n***C. The Tribunal's Decision***\n--------------------------------\n\n11.20.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay to the Respondent the total amount of US$ 8 million towards the latter's Legal Costs; and, save as aforesaid, the Tribunal rejects all other claims for Legal and Arbitration Costs made by the Parties.\n\n**PART XII: THE OPERATIVE PART**\n--------------------------------\n\n12.1.\n\n**For the reasons set out and incorporated above, the Tribunal decides and awards as follows:**\n\n**(1) It has jurisdiction to decide the Claimant's claims and the Respondent's defences pleaded in this third phase of the arbitration on their respective merits;**\n\n**(2) It dismisses the Respondent's Additional Jurisdictional Objections;**\n\n**(3) It dismisses on their merits all the Claimant's pleaded claims for damages and interest in this third phase of the arbitration;**\n\n**(4) As to Legal Costs incurred in the arbitration, it orders the Claimant to pay****to the Respondent the total sum of United States Dollars 8 million; and it dismisses the Claimant's claim for Legal Costs against the Respondent;**\n\n**(5) As to Arbitration Costs incurred in the arbitration, it orders both the Claimant and the Respondent to bear in full their own share of the Arbitration Costs without any recourse to the other; and**\n\n**(6) Save as aforesaid, all extant claims by the Claimant and the Respondent pleaded in this third phase of the arbitration are dismissed.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Respondent's Request for a Supplementary Decision", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2017-03-28T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Respondent's Request for a Supplementary Decision\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***PART I: INTRODUCTION***\n--------------------------\n\n***A.

The Procedural History***\n-------------------------------\n\n1.8.\n\nOn 14 October 2016, the Tribunal rendered the Award in the case in reference to the Claimant and the Respondent (collectively the \"Parties\").\n\n1.9.\n\nOn 22 November 2016, the ICSID Secretariat received from the Respondent a Request for a Supplementary Decision (the \"Respondent's Request\") pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention (\"the ICSID Convention\") and Rule 49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (\"the ICSID Arbitration Rules\").\n\n1.10.\n\nOn 1 December 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Respondent's Request in accordance with Rule 49(2)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and transmitted the same to the Members of the Tribunal and the Claimant.\n\n1.11.\n\nOn 5 December 2016, the Claimant filed written observations on the Respondent's Request (the \"Claimant's Response\").\n\n1.12.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, the Tribunal established the following procedural calendar:\n\n\u2022 The Respondent may submit further written observations in answer to the Response as soon as practicable, but no later than 19 December 2016 (the \"Respondent's Reply\").\n\n\u2022 The Claimant may submit written observations in answer to the Respondent's said observations as soon as practicable, but no later than 31 December 2016. (the \"Claimant's Rejoinder\").\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal shall thereafter decide upon the further procedure under ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(3).\n\n1.13.\n\nEach of the Parties filed its respective written observations by the due date.\n\n***PART II: THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION***\n--------------------------------------\n\n1.14.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered in full the Parties' written submissions, namely the Respondent's Request for a Supplementary Decision of the Award dated 22 November 2016, the Claimant's Response dated 5 December 2016, the Respondent's letter dated 19 December 2016; and the Claimant's letter dated 31 December 2016, together with the Tribunal's Award of 14 October 2016.\n\n1.15.\n\nIt is nonetheless appropriate to decide the Respondent's Request summarily, without addressing all the submissions made by the Parties.\n\n1.16.\n\nIt is clear to the Tribunal, not least from Paragraph 3.32 of the Award, that the Respondent was claiming post-award interest on its Legal Costs (albeit otherwise unspecified as to rate etc). Yet, somehow, the Tribunal inadvertently overlooked this claim for post-award interest in listing and addressing the interest issues in Paragraphs 4.13, 10.9 and 12.1(4) of the Award.\n\n1.17.\n\nIt is equally clear to the Tribunal that, had it addressed its collective mind to the Respondent's claim for post-award interest, the Tribunal would have ordered post-award interest on the Respondent's Legal Costs. The Tribunal would also have considered that such post-award interest should be simple interest at a reasonable compensatory rate. The Tribunal takes public notice that 12-months US$ LIBOR is currently running at about 1.71% per annum.\n\n1.18.\n\nAs the Tribunal understands the Parties' written submissions, it is common ground between the Parties that the claim for post-award interest was pleaded by the Respondent and that, if the Tribunal were to recognise an inadvertent error in not deciding such claim in the Award (as opposed to a deliberate decision not to do so), there would be jurisdiction to make an appropriate further decision under ICSID Arbitration Rule 49. The Tribunal adopts the same approach to Rule 49; and it readily recognises such an inadvertent error. There was no deliberate intent by the Tribunal not to decide such a claim or to decide it, *sub silentio,* adversely to the Respondent in the Award. Further, the Tribunal considers the Respondent's request to have been made in a timely manner, conforming to the requirements for a request under ICSID Arbitration Rule 49.\n\n1.19.\n\nFor these reasons, pursuant to Rule 49, the Tribunal decides to supplement and rectify its Award by ordering the Claimant to pay simple interest on the order for Legal Costs payable to the Respondent in the principal amount of L'S$ 8 million under Paragraph 12.1(4) of the Award, at the rate of an average of 12-months US$ LIBOR, as reported in the London Financial Times, starting from the date of the Claimant\u2019s receipt of the Award (namely 14 October 2016) until payment to the Respondent.\n\n1.20.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal makes no order for legal or arbitration costs by reference to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rules 47(1)(j) and 49(4) or otherwise."}]}
