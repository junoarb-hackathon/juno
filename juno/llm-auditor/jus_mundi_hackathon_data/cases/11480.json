INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Order addresses the Application for Bifurcation submitted by RWE AG and RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV (together, the ***Claimants*** or ***RWE****)* on 28 January 2022, in which the Claimants ask the Tribunal to resolve two issues on a preliminary and accelerated basis (the ***Application)****.* The Respondent, the Kingdom of the Netherlands (the ***Respondent*** or the ***Netherlands****),* opposes the Application.\n\n**II. BACKGROUND**\n------------------\n\n2.\n\nOn 20 January 2021, RWE filed its Request for Arbitration with the ICSID Secretariat pursuant to Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty (the ***ECT***) and Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the ***ICSID Convention****).* The Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration on 2 February 2022.\n\n3.\n\nIn May 2021, the Netherlands commenced proceedings against one of the Claimants, RWE AG, before the Higher Regional Court of Cologne (the ***German Proceedings***), seeking a declaration pursuant to Section 1032(2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that:1\n\n*Until the arbitral tribunal has been formed, a petition may be filed with the court*[] *to have it determine the admissibility or inadmissibility of arbitration proceedings.*\n\nEnglish translation of the German Federal Ministry of Justice, available at https://www.gesetze-iminternet.de/englisch zpo/englisch zpo.html. *See* Memorial, n 292.\n\n4.\n\nCiting the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in *Achmea B.V. v. The Slovak Republic* (***Achmea***), the Netherlands argues in the German Proceedings that there is no agreement to arbitrate between RWE AG and the Netherlands under Article 26 of the ECT, because arbitration clauses in investment protection agreements between Member States of the European Union (the ***EU****)* are incompatible with EU law.2\n\n*See* **C-117**, Petition by the Netherlands to the Cologne Court, 10 May 2021.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of 17 May 2021, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy informed the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament of the German Proceedings, explaining that:3\n\n*The initiation of proceedings before the German court is in line with the Netherlands' position that intra-EU investment arbitration is contrary to EU law. These proceedings will be conducted in parallel with the ISDS proceedings. This means that, until that time, the ICSID arbitration proceedings will continue. This will involve challenging both the jurisdiction of the tribunal and the substance of the dispute. These procedures in Germany are primarily aimed at averting the arbitration. If it proves impossible to avert the proceedings, a defence on the merits will then be put forward.*\n\n**C-113**, Letter from Minister Bastiaan vant Wout to the Lower House, 17 May 2021.\n\n6.\n\nIn a letter of 21 May 2021, the Netherlands informed ICSID of the German Proceedings, noting that the Netherlands would \"continue to diligently take part in the present proceedings before ICSID while the proceedings in Germany are pending.\"4 RWE responded on 27 May 2021 and asserted that the Netherlands\u2019 \"action is in grave breach of Article 26 ICSID Convention.\"\n\nLetter from the Respondent to ICSID, 21 May 2021.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on 2 June 2021. As an initial procedural step, on 23 July 2021, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer regarding the procedural matters addressed in a draft Procedural Order No 1 by 1 August 2021, later extended until 13 August 2021. The Parties submitted their comments on the draft on 13 August 2021, indicating areas of agreement and their respective positions on certain points of disagreement. In its comments, RWE proposed that if the Netherlands wished to raise an intra-EU jurisdictional objection in this arbitration, that objection should be bifurcated and heard on an expedited basis. The Netherlands opposed RWE\u2019s proposal, stating that it would not be in a position to determine whether to request bifurcation of any of its jurisdictional objections before seeing RWE\u2019s full case on the merits.\n\n8.\n\nDuring the first session on 30 August 2021, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed RWE\u2019s bifurcation proposal among other procedural matters.\n\n9.\n\nOn 15 October 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 1, including the Procedural Timetable as Annex B. Although the Tribunal did not adopt RWE\u2019s bifurcation proposal, it included in the Timetable a procedure whereby either Party could request bifurcation after RWE had filed its Memorial and the Netherlands had indicated whether it intends to raise an intra-EU objection. The Timetable provided two scenarios: Scenario A, to apply in the case of no request for bifurcation or a decision not to bifurcate; and Scenario B to apply in the case of a decision to bifurcate the intra-EU objection.\n\n10.\n\nIn accordance with the Procedural Timetable, on 18 December 2021, RWE filed its Memorial, which included a claim relating to the German Proceedings and request that the Tribunal:5\n\n*(C) (1.) DECLARE that the Kingdom of the Netherlands has violated the ICSID Convention by initiating the German court proceedings currently pending under docket number 19 Sch 15/21 before the Higher Regional Court of Cologne;*\n\n*(2.) ORDER the Kingdom of the Netherlands to withdraw its petition currently pending under docket number 19 Sch 15/21 before the Higher Regional Court of Cologne; and*\n\n*(3.) ORDER the Kingdom of the Netherlands to compensate Claimants for their damages suffered as a result of this violation, in particular Claimants' litigation costs including but not limited to attorneys and experts fees.*\n\nMemorial, para 689(2).\n\n11.\n\nOn 14 January 2022, the Netherlands notified the Tribunal that it intends to raise an intra-EU objection in this arbitration.\n\n12.\n\nOn 28 January 2022, RWE filed the Application, while the Netherlands did not file a request for bifurcation.\n\n13.\n\nThe Netherlands filed its response to the Application on 11 February 2022 (the ***Response****).*\n\n14.\n\nThe German Proceedings have progressed alongside this arbitration. RWE AG filed a response to the Netherlands\u2019 petition on 9 July 2021, the Netherlands filed a reply submission on 27 September 2021,6 and both sides made their final submissions on 21 and 26 January 2022 respectively.7 In its final submission, the Netherlands asked the court to render a decision before 25 February 2022, the expected date of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on bifurcation.8\n\nMemorial, para 362; **C-115**, Second Submission by the Netherlands to the Cologne Court, 27 September 2021.\n\nApplication, para. 10.\n\n**C-116**: Third Submission by the Netherlands to the Cologne Court, 21 January 2022, paras 37-38.\n\n**III. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS ON THE APPLICATION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** **T****he** **C****laimants****\u2019 P****osition**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nRWE submits that the Tribunal should bifurcate this arbitration and resolve the following two issues in an initial, expedited phase of the proceeding as set out in Scenario B of the Procedural Timetable: (a) the Netherlands\u2019 intra-EU objection; and (b) RWE\u2019s \"ancillary claim\" that the German Proceedings violate the ICSID Convention.9\n\nApplication, para 3.\n\n***1.*** ***Applicable Standards***\n-----------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nAccording to RWE, Articles 41 and 44 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules give the Tribunal wide discretion in deciding whether to bifurcate this proceeding, and the Tribunal should be guided by the overarching considerations of procedural efficiency and fairness.10\n\nApplication, para 14.\n\n17.\n\nMore specifically, RWE states that ICSID tribunals take into account the following factors when deciding whether to bifurcate jurisdictional objections:11\n\n*\u2022 Whether the objection to jurisdiction is substantial in the sense that it is not made frivolously or as a dilatory tactic;*\n\n*\u2022 Whether the objection to jurisdiction, if granted, results in a material reduction of the proceedings at the next phase, and in particular could dispose of the case as such;*\n\n*\u2022 Whether bifurcation is practical in that the relevant jurisdictional issue identified is not so intertwined with the merits that an early resolution of the question is impossible.*\n\nApplication, para 15, *citing* **CL-139**, *Glamis Gold Ltd. v. USA,* UNICTRAL / NAFTA, Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised), 31 May 2005, para 12; **CL-140**: *Emmis et al. v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Application for Bifurcation, 13 July 2013, paras 47-56; **CL-141**: *Tulip Real Estate v. Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation under Art. 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, 2 November 2012, paras 37 and 44; **CL-142**: *Philip Morris v. Australia,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No. 8, 14 April 2014, para. 109; **CL-143**: *Lighthouse Corp. v. Timor-Leste,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/2, Procedural Order No. 3 on Bifurcation and Related Requests, 8 July 2016, para 23.\n\n18.\n\nRWE adds that \"tribunals have at times also considered whether bifurcation would prejudice the claimants, in particular beyond a simple delay that could be compensated for in costs.\"12\n\nApplication, para 16, *citing* **CL-143**: *Lighthouse Corp. v. Timor-Leste,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/2, Procedural Order No. 3 on Bifurcation and Related Requests, 8 July 2016, para 20; **CL-140**: *Emmis et al. v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Application for Bifurcation, 13 July 2013, para 56.\n\n19.\n\nAlthough RWE acknowledges that the case law addressing bifurcation beyond jurisdictional objections has not produced a clear list of factors to be weighed, RWE asserts that procedural efficiency and fairness remain the paramount considerations in deciding whether to bifurcate merits claims.13\n\nApplication, para 17.\n\n20.\n\nApplying these standards in the present case, RWE argues that bifurcation of both the intra-EU objection and the ancillary merits claim would promote efficiency and fairness, whereas RWE would suffer unjustifiable prejudice in the absence of bifurcation.14\n\nApplication, para 3.\n\n***2. Bifurcation of the Intra-EU Objection***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn RWE's view, \"the intra-EU objection completely conforms to all criteria that speak in favour of bifurcation.\"15 First, the intra-EU objection is substantial, in the sense that the Tribunal cannot *prima facie* exclude its success, especially because the Netherlands has still failed to raise the objection in this arbitration.16 Second, if the Netherlands were to succeed on its objection, the arbitration would end without the need for further proceedings. Third, the intra-EU objection relates to a legal issue that is entirely separate from RWE's main claims on the merits and thus constitutes a \"text book case of an objection appropriate for bifurcation.\"17 Indeed, by raising this legal issue before the German court, the Netherlands has acknowledged that it is ripe for decision.18\n\nApplication, para 21.\n\nApplication, para 22, *citing* **CL-142**, *Philip Morris v. Australia*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No. 8, 14 April 2014, para 111.\n\nApplication, para 24, *citing* **CL-5**: *Vattenfall v. Germany,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12, Decision on the Achmea Issue, 31 August 2018, para 3 (\"The Achmea issue is a distinct matter, unrelated to the remainder of the issues between the Parties to this arbitration. The Tribunal considers it appropriate and in the interests of efficiency and procedural economy to issue this separate Decision prior to any further ruling in these proceedings, in order to address the specific jurisdictional objection by Respondent with respect to the Achmea issue.\").\n\nApplication, para 20.\n\n22.\n\nMoreover, RWE says it would be seriously prejudiced by a decision not to bifurcate the intra-EU objection. RWE stresses that the Netherlands has described the German Proceedings as \"anti-arbitration proceedings\" that are \"primarily aimed at averting the arbitration,\" thereby preventing RWE from pursuing its claims at ICSID.19 In RWE's view, the Netherlands\u2019 current strategy is to obtain a decision from the German court before the Tribunal has an opportunity to rule on the matter.20 However, RWE considers that it has \"a right to have the jurisdiction of this Tribunal determined authoritatively by this Tribunal, and only by this Tribunal.\"21\n\nApplication, para 26, *quoting* **C-113**: Letter from Minister Bastiaan vant Wout to the Lower House, 17 May 2021.\n\nApplication, para 19.\n\nApplication, para 27.\n\n***3.Bifurcation of R WE's Ancillary Merits Claim***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nRWE argues that bifurcation of its ancillary merits claim would also promote efficiency and fairness. RWE sees this claim and the intra-EU objection as \"inextricably linked both factually and legally, like two sides of the same coin.\"22 In contrast, RWE says the claim is not intertwined with its main claims and can be decided irrespective of the merits of the Parties\u2019 underlying dispute.\n\nApplication, para 6.\n\n24.\n\nAdditionally, RWE considers that \"[t]he ancillary claim concerns purely legal issues, which are neither complicated nor novel, but rather well-settled in arbitral jurisprudence and literature.\"23 It follows for RWE that the claim could easily be integrated into the existing briefing schedule for the intra-EU objection under Scenario B of the Procedural Timetable. Deciding these matters in a preliminary phase would, in RWE\u2019s view, serve procedural fairness and \"allow the Parties to focus on the real issues in dispute\" later in the proceeding.24\n\nApplication, para 30.\n\nApplication, para 31.\n\n***4. Request for Relief***\n---------------------------\n\n25.\n\nTherefore, RWE requests that the Tribunal:25\n\n*bifurcate these proceedings and hear Respondent's intra-EU objection and Claimants' ancillary claim in an expedited manner in accordance with the briefing schedule set out in Annex B - Scenario B of Procedural Order No. 1.*\n\nApplication, para 32.\n\n**B.** **T****he** **R****espondent****\u2019****s** **P****osition**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Netherlands submits that the Application is contrary to procedural efficiency and fairness and should be rejected.26\n\nResponse, para 2.\n\n***1.*** ***Applicable Standards***\n-----------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Netherlands agrees with RWE that the Tribunal has wide discretion to decide whether bifurcation is warranted in this case, and that the guiding considerations are procedural efficiency and fairness.27 However, the Netherlands diverges from RWE on the application of those considerations in the factual circumstances of this case.\n\nResponse, para 9.\n\n***2. Bifurcation of the Intra-EU Objection***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Netherlands urges the Tribunal not to bifurcate the intra-EU objection for several reasons.\n\n29.\n\nFirst, the Netherlands says bifurcation would not serve procedural fairness because it \"could preclude the Tribunal from taking account of a ruling on a question of EU law rendered by the competent EU court that is at the core of the intra-EU objection.\"28 Specifically, if the German court has not rendered its judgment before briefing on the intra- EU objection in a bifurcated scenario has completed, the Tribunal will have an incomplete record on which to make its decision.29\n\nResponse, para 12.\n\nResponse, para 12.\n\n30.\n\nSecond, the Netherlands advances a related argument that bifurcation could lead to procedural inefficiency because the Tribunal would need to revisit its decision on the intra-EU objection once the court renders its judgment in the German Proceedings.30\n\nResponse, paras 13-14.\n\n31.\n\nThird, the Netherlands asserts that bifurcation is inefficient on RWE's own case. Given RWE's position that the intra-EU objection must fail, there can be no efficiency gained in debating that issue first, rather than in parallel with the merits.31\n\nResponse, paras 15-16.\n\n32.\n\nFourth, the Netherlands alleges that the Application is motivated by RWE's desire to prevent the Tribunal from considering the German court's decision, which is not a valid basis on which to seek bifurcation. According to the Netherlands, RWE has mischaracterized the German Proceedings, which are in fact \"concerned with a question of EU law only, and do not affect the Tribunal's power to rule on its own competence under Article 41 [of the] ICSID Convention.\"32\n\nResponse, para 19.\n\n33.\n\nFinally, the Netherlands emphasizes the principle that a Party has the right to present its case as it sees fit. In this case, the Netherlands says that absent concerns of procedural efficiency or fairness, it is entitled to proceed with its plan \"to present in its Counter-Memorial a full picture of why RWE's case should be rejected, both on the jurisdiction and on the merits.\"33 The Netherlands notes that RWE has not cited any case in which a jurisdictional objection was bifurcated over the respondent's opposition.34\n\nResponse, para 20.\n\nResponse, para 21.\n\n***3.Bifurcation of R WE\u2019s Ancillary Merits Claim***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Netherlands similarly presents several reasons why, in its view, RWE's ancillary merits claim should not be bifurcated.\n\n35.\n\nFirst, the Netherlands asserts that RWE\u2019s request to bifurcate this claim was neither contemplated in Procedural Order No. 1 nor referenced by RWE in the discussions surrounding that Order. Thus, RWE\u2019s request falls outside the scope of Procedural Order No.1 and lacks any basis.35\n\nResponse, para 23.\n\n36.\n\nSecond, the Netherlands notes the language of Article 41(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which states that the Tribunal may \"suspend the proceeding on the merits\" pending consideration of jurisdictional issue. For the Netherlands, it follows that this provision does not provide a basis for bifurcation of a merits issue.36\n\nResponse, para 24, *citing* **RL-2**, Christoph Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclair. *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed. Cambridge University Press 2009), Article 41, para 63 (\"ICSID tribunals have routinely suspended proceedings on the merits upon receipt of an objection to jurisdiction.\").\n\n37.\n\nThird, in the Netherlands\u2019 view, there is no procedural efficiency to be gained from bifurcating this specific claim, which is not dispositive of the arbitration or any significant portion of it.37\n\nResponse, para 25.\n\n38.\n\nFourth, the Netherlands contends that RWE\u2019s claim is not substantial, because: (a) the German Proceedings are about the operation of EU law, which do not in any way inhibit the Tribunal from determining its own jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention; and (b) there is no concern about exclusivity pursuant to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, as \"issues of EU law are not exclusively for an ICSID tribunal to determine but rather for the EU courts under the supervision of the CJEU.\"38 In fact, says the Netherlands, \"[t]o the extent Article 26 of the ICSID Convention is engaged at all, RWE has waived ICSID exclusivity and/or consented to non-exclusivity\" by initiating parallel proceedings before the Dutch courts regarding the same purported investment and the same regulatory measure at issue in this arbitration.39\n\nResponse, para 27.\n\nResponse, para 28, *citing* **RL-2**, Christoph Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclair. *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed. Cambridge University Press 2009), Article 26, para 54.\n\n39.\n\nFinally, the Netherlands considers that Scenario B of the Procedural Timetable is not suitable for merits claims and would give RWE more opportunities to brief the issue than the Netherlands would have, violating the Netherlands\u2019 right to be heard and right to equal treatment.40\n\nResponse, paras 29-30.\n\n***4. Request for Relief***\n---------------------------\n\n40.\n\nTherefore, the Netherlands requests that the Tribunal:41\n\n*(a) REJECT the Request for Bifurcation of the Intra-EU objection and one of RWE's merits claims;*\n\n*(b) ORDER Claimants to bear the costs incurred in connection with the Request for Bifurcation.*\n\nResponse, para 32.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal emphasizes that the purpose of this Order is to decide whether to bifurcate the present proceedings. The Tribunal takes no decision at this stage on the merits of the two issues identified in the Application. Further, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis is necessarily based on the Tribunal\u2019s understanding of the record as it presently stands and should not be understood to preempt any later finding of fact or conclusion of law.\n\n**A.** **A****pplicable** **S****tandards**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn ICSID proceedings, requests for bifurcation of one or more jurisdictional objections are common. The applicable standards are well known and uncontested in this case. Both sides acknowledge that the Tribunal has broad discretion under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules to determine whether bifurcation is warranted here.\n\n43.\n\nTo recall, Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n*Any objection by a party to the dispute that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.*\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4) provides in relevant part that the Tribunal:\n\n*may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix time limits for the further procedures.*\n\n44.\n\nNeither the ICSID Convention nor the Arbitration Rules set forth specific criteria to be considered in deciding whether to bifurcate objections, leaving the decision entirely to the discretion of a tribunal. In exercising this discretion, ICSID tribunals have identified certain factors as important to the analysis, including: (a) whether the objection is substantial and not frivolous; (b) whether the objection, if granted, has the potential either to dispose of the entire case or to result in a material reduction of scope in the next phase of proceedings; and (c) whether the jurisdictional issue is sufficiently discrete and not so intertwined with the merits that it may be fairly resolved separate from the merits and without the risk of duplicative proceedings.42 More generally, as noted by both sides, the analysis should be driven by the overarching considerations of procedural fairness and efficiency. The Tribunal fully agrees with this framework.\n\n*See, e.g.,* **CL-139**, *Glamis Gold Ltd. v. USA,* UNICTRAL / NAFTA, Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised), 31 May 2005, para 12; **CL-140**: *Emmis et al. v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Application for Bifurcation, 13 July 2013, paras 47-56; **CL-141**: *Tulip Real Estate v. Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation under Art. 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, 2 November 2012, paras 37 and 44; **CL-142**: *Philip Morris v. Australia,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No. 8, 14 April 2014, para. 109; **CL-143**: *Lighthouse Corp. v. Timor-Leste,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/2, Procedural Order No. 3 on Bifurcation and Related Requests, 8 July 2016, paras 20-21.\n\n45.\n\nThat being said, there are important aspects of the present Application that set it apart from a common request for bifurcation. First, in most cases it is the respondent State that seeks bifurcation of jurisdictional objections, whereas here it is the *Claimants* that are seeking bifurcation, and that over the objection of the Netherlands. Second, the Claimants seek preliminary resolution not only of a jurisdictional objection, but also a merits claim. Third, it is clear to the Tribunal that the key driving factor for both the Application and the Netherlands' opposition is the potential impact of the German Proceedings on the arbitration - not the traditional considerations of procedural efficiency set out above. Although none of these characteristics of the Application weighs automatically in favor of or against bifurcation, each of them must factor into the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n**B.** **T****he** **I****ntra****-EU O****bjection**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn approaching the question of whether bifurcation is warranted in this case, the Tribunal begins with the nature of the intra-EU objection. Although the precise contours of the Netherlands\u2019 objection will not be known until later in the proceeding, it is already apparent that the objection meets many of the criteria identified above weighing in favor of bifurcation. The question presented is likely to be purely legal and capable of resolution without a detailed investigation of the underlying facts of this case.43 The objection is substantial, as RWE acknowledges, and a decision upholding the objection would dispose of the entire case. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Netherlands has provided no persuasive reason why the nature of this jurisdictional issue is not appropriate for bifurcation. Thus, the traditional test for bifurcation would appear to be satisfied.\n\n*See* **CL-5**: *Vattenfall v. Germany,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12, Decision on the Achmea Issue, 31 August 2018, para 3 (\"The Achmea issue is a distinct matter, unrelated to the remainder of the issues between the Parties to this arbitration.\").\n\n47.\n\nAs already noted, however, the Application is not a traditional request for bifurcation. The Claimants address procedural efficiency only briefly, focusing instead on their main argument that the German Proceedings are designed to undermine the integrity of the arbitration and prevent RWE from pursuing claims at ICSID. The purpose of the Application is, in the Claimants\u2019 words, to preserve their \"right to have the jurisdiction of this Tribunal determined authoritatively by this Tribunal, and only by this Tribunal.\"44\n\nApplication, para 27.\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal fully understands RWE\u2019s concerns, particularly in light of statements by the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy that the German Proceedings are \"primarily aimed at averting the arbitration.\"45 At the same time, the Tribunal understands that the Minister\u2019s statements do not reflect the Netherlands\u2019 position in this arbitration. To the contrary, the Netherlands states in its Response that:\n\na. \"The German proceedings are concerned with a question of EU law only, and **do not affect the Tribunal\u2019s power to rule on its own competence under Article 41 ICSID Convention**.\"46\n\nb. \"The German proceedings moreover result in a declaratory judgment, which affirms what applies under EU law in any event, i.e. regardless whether the German courts render their decision. No prejudice can result from such an affirmation.\"47\n\nc. \"the Netherlands does not deny the Tribunal\u2019s competence to decide its own competence under the ICSID Convention.\"48\n\n**C-113**: Letter from Minister Bastiaan vant Wout to the Lower House, 17 May 2021.\n\nResponse, para 19 (emphasis added).\n\n*Id.*\n\nResponse, para 26.\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal understands these statements by the Netherlands as assurances that it will not take any steps to interfere with the Tribunal\u2019s *kompetenz-kompetenz*. Given these assurances, and absent any indication from the Claimants as to precisely how the German Proceedings might be used to prevent them from pursuing their claims at ICSID, the Tribunal is not persuaded that RWE would be prejudiced by a decision not to bifurcate the intra-EU objection.\n\n50.\n\nAlso as noted, another significant aspect of the Application is that it is the Claimants that are requesting bifurcation of *the Respondent\u2019s* forthcoming objection. This unusual procedural posture gives rise to the Netherlands\u2019 main argument against bifurcation - that it deserves the right to argue its intra-EU objection as it sees fit. Specifically, the Netherlands wishes to address the outcome of the German Proceedings - whatever the outcome - when asserting its intra-EU objection, which it plans to do with its full defense in the Counter-Memorial. Without taking any view on the various questions surrounding the German Proceedings, including whether those proceedings have any bearing on the intra-EU objection, the Tribunal considers the Netherlands\u2019 position to be reasonable. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, a respondent State is entitled to the opportunity to frame its jurisdictional objections as it wishes, absent overriding considerations of efficiency or fairness.\n\n51.\n\nTaking all these points together, the Tribunal finds the balance to be against bifurcation of the intra-EU objection, particularly because: (a) it is the Claimants that have made the Application; (b) the Claimants have done so on the basis of concerns about procedural integrity that do not appear to be justified at this stage; (c) the Netherlands\u2019 stated desire to address the outcome of the German Proceedings when briefing the intra-EU objection is credible and reasonable in light of its indication that those proceedings will not be used to undermine the Tribunal's *kompetenz-kompetenz;* and (d) ultimately, if it transpires that the Netherlands' opposition to bifurcation has resulted in wasted costs, any harm to RWE can be remedied through the Tribunal's allocation of costs.\n\n52.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal does not consider that a claimant's application to bifurcate a jurisdictional objection is *per se* unacceptable. To the contrary, the Tribunal's view is that considerations of fairness and procedural efficiency apply equally irrespective of whether the respondent or the claimant applies for bifurcation. In the specific circumstances of this case, the Tribunal finds that those considerations, viewed holistically, weigh against bifurcation.\n\n**C. RWE\u2019****s** **A****ncillary** **M****erits** **C****laim**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nTurning to RWE's ancillary merits claim, the Tribunal can be brief.\n\n54.\n\nAs RWE appears to acknowledge, this claim does not fall within the legal framework of Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4), which concerns only preliminary jurisdictional and competence objections. Rather, as embodied in Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, the authority of an ICSID tribunal to bifurcate a merits claim falls within its residual power to decide procedural matters not covered by the Arbitration Rules.\n\n55.\n\nGiven that requests to bifurcate merits claims are relatively rare, the applicable standards are less developed than those set out above for jurisdictional objections. That being said, the Tribunal has no doubt that fairness, justice and procedural efficiency remain paramount considerations.\n\n56.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, these considerations do not support bifurcation of RWE's merits claim, particularly in light of the Tribunal's decision not to bifurcate the intra-EU objection. As RWE explains, its claim and the intra-EU objection are \"inextricably linked both factually and legally, like two sides of the same coin.\"49 Thus, it is evident that hearing the ancillary merits claim and the intra-EU jurisdictional objection in separate phases of the proceeding would lead to duplicative proceedings. The Tribunal sees no reason to put that burden on the Parties.\n\nApplication, para 6.\n\n**D.** **C****onclusion**\n-------------------------\n\n57.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal determines that, in the unusual circumstances of this case, separate preliminary resolution of the Netherlands\u2019 intra-EU objection and RWE's ancillary claim would not serve the overall interests of justice, the interests of the Parties, or the integrity of the proceedings. The Claimants\u2019 Application is therefore denied. The case will move forward on the schedule for non-bifurcated proceedings in the Procedural Timetable.\n\n58.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal underscores that its decision is taken in light of the Netherlands\u2019 assurances that it will not take any steps to interfere with the Tribunal\u2019s *kompetenz-kompetenz.*\n\n**V. ORDER**\n------------\n\n59.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal DECIDES and ORDERS as follows:\n\n(A) The Claimants\u2019 Application is **denied**.\n\n(B) The arbitration is to proceed in accordance with the schedule for non-bifurcated proceedings set out in Scenario A of the Procedural Timetable at Annex B of Procedural Order No 1, unless subsequently modified by the Tribunal.\n\n(C) The issue of costs is reserved to a later stage of the arbitration."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2022-08-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Decision addresses the Request for Provisional Measures submitted by RWE AG and RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV (together, the ***Claimants*** or ***RWE***) on 29 April 2022, in which the Claimants ask the Tribunal to direct the Kingdom of the Netherlands (the ***Respondent*** or the ***Netherlands***) to withdraw or suspend proceedings against RWE AG before the Higher Regional Court of Cologne (the ***Request***). The Netherlands opposes the Request.\n\n**II. BACKGROUND**\n------------------\n\n2.\n\nOn 20 January 2021, RWE filed its Request for Arbitration with the ICSID Secretariat pursuant to Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty (the ***ECT***) and Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the ***ICSID Convention***). The Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration on 2 February 2021.\n\n3.\n\nOn 26 February 2021, the second Claimant, RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV, commenced proceedings against the Netherlands before the District Court of The Hague (the ***Dutch Proceedings***), seeking monetary compensation in relation to its investment in the Eemshaven plant, which is also at issue in this arbitration.1\n\n**R-2**, Writ of Summons, 26 February 2021.\n\n4.\n\nIn May 2021, the Netherlands commenced proceedings against the first Claimant, RWE AG, before the Higher Regional Court of Cologne (the ***Cologne Court*** and the ***German Proceedings***), seeking a declaration pursuant to Section 1032(2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (the ***ZPO***), which provides that:2\n\n*Until the arbitral tribunal has been formed, a petition may be filed with the court*[] *to have it determine the admissibility or inadmissibility of arbitration proceedings.*\n\nEnglish translation of the German Federal Ministry of Justice, available at https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch\\_zpo/englisch\\_zpo.html. *See* Memorial, n 292.\n\n5.\n\nIn the German Proceedings, the Netherlands argues that there is no agreement to arbitrate between RWE AG and the Netherlands under Article 26 of the ECT, because arbitration clauses in investment protection agreements between Member States of the European Union (the ***EU***) are incompatible with EU law, as confirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Union (the ***CJEU***) in its judgment in *Achmea B.V. v. The Slovak Republic* (***Achmea***).3\n\n*See* **C-117**, Petition by the Netherlands to the Cologne Court, 10 May 2021; **RL-3** , *Slovak Republic v Achmea B.V.*, CJEU, Case C-284/16, ECLI:EU:C:2018:158, Judgment dated 6 March 2018.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 17 May 2021, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy informed the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament of the commencement of the German Proceedings, explaining that:4\n\n*The initiation of proceedings before the German court is in line with the Netherlands' position that intra-EU investment arbitration is contrary to EU law. These proceedings will be conducted in parallel with the ISDS proceedings. This means that, until that time, the ICSID arbitration proceedings will continue. This will involve challenging both the jurisdiction of the tribunal and the substance of the dispute. These procedures in Germany are primarily aimed at averting the arbitration. If it proves impossible to avert the proceedings, a defence on the merits will then be put forward.*\n\n**C-113**, Letter from Minister Bastiaan vant Wout to the Lower House, 17 May 2021.\n\n7.\n\nOn 21 May 2021, the Netherlands informed the ICSID Secretariat of the German Proceedings, stating that it was seeking to:5\n\n*obtain a decision from the courts in RWE's home jurisdiction on the validity of an arbitration agreement which RWE alleges exists between it and the Netherlands by virtue of Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty, and that is said to be the basis for these proceedings before ICSID.*\n\nLetter from the Respondent to ICSID, 21 May 2021.\n\n8.\n\nThe Netherlands noted that it would \"continue to diligently take part in the present proceedings before ICSID while the proceedings in Germany are pending.\"6\n\nLetter from the Respondent to ICSID, 21 May 2021.\n\n9.\n\nRWE responded on 27 May 2021 and asserted that the action of the Netherlands \"is in grave breach of Article 26 ICSID Convention.\"7\n\nLetter from the Claimant to ICSID, 27 May 2021.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on 2 June 2021 and held the first session with the Parties on 30 August 2021. On 15 October 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 1.\n\n11.\n\nOn 18 December 2021, in accordance with the Procedural Timetable in Procedural Order No 1, RWE filed its Memorial. The Memorial included a claim relating to the German Proceedings and a request that the Tribunal:8\n\n*(C) (1.) DECLARE that the Kingdom of the Netherlands has violated the ICSID Convention by initiating the German court proceedings currently pending under docket number 19 Sch 15/21 before the Higher Regional Court of Cologne;*\n\n*(2.) ORDER the Kingdom of the Netherlands to withdraw its petition currently pending under docket number 19 Sch 15/21 before the Higher Regional Court of Cologne; and*\n\n*(3.) ORDER the Kingdom of the Netherlands to compensate Claimants for their damages suffered as a result of this violation, in particular Claimants' litigation costs including but not limited to attorneys and experts fees.*\n\nMemorial, para 689(2).\n\n12.\n\nOn 14 January 2022, the Netherlands notified the Tribunal that it intends to raise an intra-EU objection in this arbitration.\n\n13.\n\nOn 28 January 2022, RWE filed a Request for Bifurcation, asking the Tribunal to bifurcate this arbitration and resolve the following two issues in an expedited initial phase: (a) the Netherlands' intra-EU objection; and (b) RWE's \"ancillary claim\" that the German Proceedings violate the ICSID Convention. RWE's main argument in favor of bifurcation was that the German Proceedings are designed to undermine the integrity of the arbitration and prevent RWE from pursuing claims at ICSID. According to RWE, bifurcation was necessary to preserve its \"right to have the jurisdiction of this Tribunal determined authoritatively by this Tribunal, and only by this Tribunal.\"9\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, para 27.\n\n14.\n\nThe Netherlands filed its response to the Request for Bifurcation on 11 February 2022.\n\n15.\n\nNeither side requested a hearing on RWE's Request for Bifurcation.\n\n16.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, the Tribunal denied RWE's Request for Bifurcation in Procedural Order No 2 (***PO2***). In doing so, the Tribunal noted certain statements made by the Netherlands in its response to the Request for Bifurcation, which the Tribunal understood \"as assurances that it will not take any steps to interfere with the Tribunal's *kompetenz-kompetenz*.\"10\n\nPO2, paras 48-49.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of 2 March 2022, RWE commented on PO2, expressing its view that the Netherlands' statements upon which the Tribunal relied were \"incorrect both as a matter of Respondent's conduct in the German Proceedings and under German law.\" RWE added:\n\n*The situation in relation to the German Proceedings continues to develop. Claimants therefore reserve all rights, including to further comment on the Tribunal's decision in Procedural Order No. 2 and to file further applications in relation to the matters covered therein.*\n\n18.\n\nRWE filed the Request on 29 April 2022.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of 3 May 2022, the Netherlands asserted that the Request was \"an inadmissible attempt to re-litigate issues that have previously been decided [in PO2], without new facts or circumstances present.\" The Netherlands requested the Tribunal to dismiss the Request as inadmissible or, in the alternative, grant the Netherlands six weeks to file its response to the Request.\n\n20.\n\nAfter receiving RWE's response to the Netherlands' letter of 3 May 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 3, in which it: (a) found the Request admissible; and (b) set a schedule for briefing on the Request.\n\n21.\n\nIn accordance with that schedule, the Netherlands filed its Response to Request for Provisional Measures (the ***Response***) on 31 May 2022; the Claimants filed their Reply Relating to their Request for Provisional Measures (the ***Reply***) on 7 June 2022; and the Netherlands filed its Rejoinder on the Request for Provisional Measures (the ***Rejoinder***) on 14 June 2022.\n\n22.\n\nThe German Proceedings have progressed in parallel with this arbitration. Among other submissions, on 20 January 2022, RWE AG asked the Cologne Court to suspend the German Proceedings pending the Tribunal's decision on its jurisdiction.11 The Netherlands opposed this request, stating that the Cologne Court's decision:12\n\n*does not depend on the decision of the ICSID Arbitral Tribunal or even on the application of the ICSID Convention. The* [court] *can decide the relevant question in this proceeding, whether the arbitral proceedings are admissible on the basis of an effective arbitration agreement, exclusively on the basis of Union law and German law. The applicability of the ICSID Convention depends on the effectiveness of the offer to arbitrate in Art. 26.*\n\n**C-128**, RWE AG's suspension application in the German Proceedings, 20 January 2022.\n\n**C-129**, Respondent's opposition to RWE AG's suspension application in the German Proceedings, 31 January 2022, para 8.\n\n23.\n\nThe Cologne Court invited further and final comments by 18 March 2022, which both Parties submitted, and indicated that it would deliberate in June 2022.13 RWE AG has requested an oral hearing, but the court is not required to hold such a hearing. Thus, after deliberating, the court could potentially rule on the Netherland's petition.14\n\n**C-123**, Letter from the Cologne Court to the parties of the German Proceedings, 11 April 2022.\n\nRequest, para 22.\n\n24.\n\nOn 23 February 2022, RWE requested the Netherlands to provide a written confirmation that \"it will not seek any injunctive or similar relief on the basis of a potential decision in the German Proceedings and refrain from taking any other action on that basis to restrict any of the Claimants in their ability to pursue the ICSID arbitration.\"15 The Netherlands declined to provide the requested assurance, stating instead that: \"subject to any jurisdictional objections and the above-mentioned obligations, the Netherlands has no intention to preclude the RWE Claimants from continuing to participate in the [ICSID] arbitration.\"16\n\n**C-130**, Claimants' letter concerning the German Proceedings, 23 February 2022, p 2.\n\n**C-131**, Respondent's answer to Claimants' letter of 23 February 2022 concerning the German Proceedings, 22 March 2022.\n\n25.\n\nOn 11 July 2022, the Tribunal requested an update on the German Proceedings from the Parties. On the same date, counsel for the Claimants reported informally that the Cologne Court was expected to deliberate on 14 July 2022.\n\n26.\n\nCounsel for both Parties provided updates on 22 July 2022. On the Claimants' behalf, counsel reported:17\n\n*We have followed up on this request with the judge-rapporteur of the responsible Senate via telephone on 19 July 2022. During the call, she was not able to specify a date for a decision. She merely informed us that she expects the Senate to deliberate on her draft in mid-August and that a decision still in the month of August would be possible, subject to the deliberations of the Senate.*\n\n*No further information has been received by the Court to date, neither orally nor in writing.*\n\n*Given that no further submissions and no oral hearing are planned, to the best of Claimants' knowledge a decision could thus be rendered at any time after mid-August without prior notice to the Parties.*\n\nOn the Respondent's behalf, counsel reported:18\n\n*The information given in the Higher Regional Court's notification in April 2022, that it would likely deliberate in June, is the latest written information that the Parties have received in this regard. The Parties have not received official notice that such deliberation has indeed taken place or when a decision is to be expected. \u2026*\n\n*A call to the Higher Regional Court on Monday, 13 July 2022, confirmed that no decision has been taken yet.*\n\n*In its notification dated April 2022, the Higher Regional Court had also advised the Parties to file any last submissions by 18 March 2022. This still is the current status. \u2026*\n\n*Considering the average decision making process by German courts, a decision by the Higher Regional Court in the third quarter of 2022 seems likely.*\n\nEmail from the Claimants' counsel to the Tribunal, through ICSID, 22 July 2022.\n\nEmail from the Respondent's counsel to the Tribunal, through ICSID, 22 July 2022.\n\n**III.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS ON THE REQUEST**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **C****laimants****' P****osition**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nRWE submits that \"provisional measures are urgently needed to protect the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration, the Tribunal's exclusive *Kompetenz-Kompetenz*, Claimants' substantive rights and this arbitration's procedural integrity.\"21\n\nRequest, para 3.\n\n30.\n\nAs detailed below, RWE argues that the Tribunal has broad authority to order provisional measures, and that the Request meets all relevant requirements.\n\n***1. Applicable Standards***\n-----------------------------\n\n31.\n\nRWE considers that the Tribunal has broad authority under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1) to order provisional measures, stating that \"ICSID tribunals have consistently exercised this power to enjoin participation in parallel domestic proceedings in order to protect the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration\" and their kompetenz-kompetenz.22 As found by the tribunal in *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s*:23\n\n*Among the rights that may be protected by provisional measures is the right guaranteed by Article 26 to have the ICSID arbitration be the exclusive remedy for the dispute to the exclusion of any other remedy, whether domestic or international, judicial or administrative.*\n\nRequest, para 61, *citing* **CL-151**, *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v.

The Government of Mongolia*, UNCITRAL, Order on Interim Measures, 2 September 2008, para 45.\n\n***2. Relevant Factual Circumstances***\n---------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Request targets the German Proceedings, which in RWE's view pose a serious threat to this arbitration. RWE considers that the German Proceedings are part of a larger strategy \"to end this arbitration by stopping Claimants from pursuing it\" and thus present a \"danger to this arbitration [that] is not merely theoretical.\"25\n\nRequest, \u00a7 II (Heading) and para 32; Reply, para 46.\n\n34.\n\nAccording to RWE, this danger is inherent in proceedings under Section 1032(2) of the German ZPO, which \"presupposes that an arbitral tribunal's *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* is limited by and subject to state court intervention and supervision.\"26 The Netherlands has challenged the admissibility of this ICSID arbitration on the basis that the arbitration agreement in the ECT is invalid. If the Cologne Court (or the Federal Court of Justice, on appeal) decides that this arbitration is inadmissible, that decision would be binding under German law on the parties to the German Proceedings, and its effect would not be limited to EU law.27\n\nRequest, para 18.\n\nRequest, para 43; Reply, para 6.\n\n35.\n\nAlthough RWE does not consider that a German court judgment can bind the Tribunal acting under international law, RWE sees that a \"second option is possible: Respondent could \u2013 and very likely will \u2013 try to prevent Claimant RWE AG from further pursuing its case in this arbitration.\"28 In RWE's view, the specific risk is that the Cologne Court decision could form the basis of anti-arbitration injunction, forcing RWE to withdraw this case.29 The judgment might also be used in third states to block enforcement of a future award. This is part of the \"playbook\" proposed by Mr Tim Maxian Rusche of the European Commission, who has argued that the basis for an anti-arbitration injunction would be that \"the investor commits a tort by violating a final determination of a court.\"30\n\nRequest, para 33.\n\nRequest, paras 37, 97.\n\nRequest, para 39, *quoting* **C-125**, Maxian Rusche, IPRax 2021, 494, pp 501-502.\n\n36.\n\nGiven the nature of the German Proceedings, RWE sees no basis for the representations which the Netherlands has made to the Tribunal and which the Tribunal relied upon in PO2.31 In particular, RWE rejects the Netherlands' position that the German Proceedings will result only in a declaratory judgment that concerns EU law only.32 To the contrary, the whole purpose of a petition under section 1032(2) of the German ZPO is a ruling that a tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear a certain matter, and the effect of that ruling is not limited to EU law. This is clear, says RWE, from the relief the Netherlands has requested from the Cologne Court: a declaration that this arbitration is \"inadmissible,\" meaning that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.33 Further, in opposing RWE's request for suspension of the court proceedings, the Netherlands' counsel told the Cologne Court that, \"[i]f anything, the ICSID Arbitral Tribunal would be required to suspend its proceedings, as its jurisdiction depends on the existence of an effective arbitration agreement.\"34\n\nRequest, paras 23-31, *citing* PO2, para 48.\n\nRequest, paras 35-27; Reply, para 65.\n\nReply, para 5.\n\nRequest, para 51, *quoting* **C-129**, Respondent's opposition to RWE AG's suspension application in the German Proceedings, 31 January 2022, para 12.\n\n37.\n\nIn these circumstances, RWE considers that the Tribunal's intervention is needed because the Netherlands has refused to agree to suspend the German Proceedings, and the Cologne Court so far has not ruled on RWE's suspension request.35\n\nRequest, paras 44-57.\n\n***3. Whether Provisional Measures are Warranted***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nRWE submits that the requested measures are necessary to protect four related rights.\n\n39.\n\nFirst, RWE argues that the German Proceedings threaten the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration.36 The Netherlands has expressly asked the Cologne Court to rule on the Tribunal's jurisdiction, which is a matter that falls exclusively to this Tribunal under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. Although there are numerous examples of domestic courts observing the exclusivity guaranteed by Article 26, \"neither Respondent nor the Cologne Court have so far acted in line with the ICSID Convention.\"37\n\nRequest, paras 66-74; Reply, paras 23-43.\n\nRequest, para 72.\n\n40.\n\nSecond, RWE argues that the requested measures are necessary to protect the Tribunal's *kompetenz-kompetenz* under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, which provides that \"[a]ny objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal.\"38 In RWE's view, because German arbitration law does not recognize exclusive *kompetenz-kompetenz*, any petition under section 1032(2) of the German ZPO in relation to an ICSID arbitration infringes upon the ICSID tribunal's exclusive competence.\n\nRequest, paras 75-91, *quoting* ICSID Convention, Article 41(*RWE's emphasis*).\n\n41.\n\nRWE challenges the Netherlands' position that Article 41 does not apply where a tribunal's jurisdiction is contested. Otherwise, says RWE, exclusivity would cease to have any meaningful application.39 According to RWE, \"ICSID tribunals have consistently deployed provisional measures to protect their *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* from collateral attack in another forum.\"40 As stated by the tribunal in *Perenco v Ecuador*, \"once putatively vested with jurisdiction to hear a claim (subject to resolving any objections thereto definitively), an ICSID tribunal has the duty to protect its jurisdiction to resolve the dispute that has been put before it.\"41\n\nReply, paras 24-30, *citing* **CL-148**, Expert Opinion by Professor Schreuer in the German Proceedings, 7 July 2021, p 4.\n\nRequest, para 79.\n\n**CL-134**, *Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Provisional Measures, 8 May 2009, para 64. See para 61 (\"Unless and until the Tribunal rules that it has no jurisdiction to entertain this dispute, if its jurisdiction is hereafter challenged, or the Tribunal delivers a final award on the merits, none of the parties may resort to the domestic courts of Ecuador to enforce or resist any claim or right which forms part of the subject matter of this arbitration\").\n\n42.\n\nThird, RWE argues that the German Proceedings threaten the procedural integrity of this arbitration.42 In the words of the *Quiborax v Bolivia* tribunal, there is \"no doubt that [an ICSID tribunal] has the power to grant provisional measures to preserve the procedural integrity of the ICSID proceedings.\"43 As discussed above, RWE sees the German Proceedings as \"anti-arbitration\" proceedings that could form the basis for the Netherlands to apply for an anti-arbitration injunction in the German courts, following the \"playbook\" of Mr Maxian Rusche. RWE considers this threat to procedural integrity more serious than that leading to the provisional measures ordered in *Quiborax* and *Nova v Romania*.44\n\nRequest, paras 92-98.\n\n**CL-152**, *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, para 141.\n\nRequest, para 98.\n\n43.\n\nFourth, RWE argues that the requested measures are necessary to protect its right to access arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT. As recognized by several ICSID tribunals, an investor's right to arbitration is a key protection offered by investment treaties. RWE contends that the Netherlands' initiation of the German Proceedings puts that right in jeopardy.45\n\nRequest, paras 99-106.\n\n44.\n\nTurning to the criteria for granting a request for provisional measures, RWE asserts that all the relevant requirements are met.\n\n45.\n\nTo begin, RWE says that it has set out a *prima facie* case on both jurisdiction and the merits, as demonstrated by the absence of any application by the Netherlands under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5).46\n\nRequest, paras 109-110.\n\n46.\n\nRWE then argues that the requested measures are urgent and, indeed, *inherently* urgent, because the procedural integrity of the proceedings and the Tribunal's jurisdiction are at issue. RWE cites commentary that in the case of a threat to the tribunal's jurisdiction, \"the harm is inherent, and hence indisputable.\"47 According to RWE, this urgency is exacerbated by the status of the German Proceedings, with the Cologne Court's indication of deliberations in the near future, as a \"decision by the Court, and a subsequent request for an injunction, can be presumed to be rendered shortly thereafter.\"48\n\nRequest, para 112, *quoting* **CL-136**: Charles N. Brower and Ronald E.M. Goodman, Provisional Measures and the Protection of ICSID Jurisdictional Exclusivity Against Municipal Proceedings, 6(2) ICSID Review 431 (1991) 461.\n\nRequest, para 115.\n\n47.\n\nAs an element of urgency, RWE contends that the relief it requests is necessary ahead of a decision by the Cologne Court. Otherwise, \"[i]f Respondent were allowed to continue the German Proceedings, Claimants might have to discontinue these proceedings, erasing the possibility to remedy any harm caused by an award altogether.\"49 Moreover, RWE asserts that, because the Tribunal's power to order provisional measures is limited to the Parties, once the Cologne Court renders its decision, \"the Tribunal will not be in a position anymore to fashion appropriate relief in relation to such a German court decision.\"50\n\nRequest, para 118.\n\nRequest, para 120.\n\n48.\n\nFinally, RWE argues that the risk of allowing the Netherlands to pursue the German Proceedings outweighs any burden on the Netherlands of discontinuing them, at least temporarily. In fact, RWE states that an order granting the Request \"would simply require Respondent to comply with its ICSID Convention obligations, something which cannot be viewed as burdensome given that it freely agreed to the terms of the Convention.\"51 Nothing in the Tribunal's order would prevent the Netherlands from filing whatever objections it might wish under EU law at any enforcement stage.52\n\nRequest, para 123.\n\nRequest, para 124.\n\n49.\n\nRWE does not accept that granting the Request would force the Netherlands to violate its obligations under the EU Treaties, on the basis of *PL Holdings v Poland*.53 In that case, the CJEU held that EU Member States are required to challenge the validity of an arbitration clause that is inconsistent with EU law before the arbitral tribunal or a competent court of a Member State. However, RWE argues that EU Member State courts are *not* competent with respect to ICSID proceedings, as confirmed by the CJEU and the recent *Kammergericht* decision in *Germany v Mainstream Renewables*.54 Thus, RWE asserts that the Netherlands' petition before the Cologne Court is not mandated by the EU Treaties, and any contrary view expressed by the European Commission acting in its executive capacity is irrelevant.55\n\n**CL-150**, ECJ, C-109/20, Judgment of 26 October 2021 (*Republiken Polen v.

Any judgment of the Cologne Court would likely be subject to appeal and not become binding for a year or more. Thus, according to RWE, the legal value of a Cologne Court judgment would be \"extremely limited, while the risk of an injunction on the basis of or irrespective of a first instance decision remains.\"56\n\nReply, para 12.\n\n51.\n\nTo support the Request, RWE cites a number of cases, including *Ipek v Turkey* and *SGS v Pakistan*.57 RWE also notes that in the parallel case of *Uniper v Netherlands*, the tribunal \"strongly recommend[ed] that the Respondent take no further steps that could aggravate the dispute or deter, restrain or preclude any of the Claimants from continuing to participate fully and freely in this Arbitration.\"58 Although the *Uniper* tribunal stopped short of ordering the Netherlands to withdraw similar proceedings before the German courts, RWE considers that the Request in this case should be granted in full.\n\nRequest, paras 126-134, *citing* **CL-172**, *Ipek Investment Limited v.

Relevant Factual Circumstances***\n---------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Netherlands argues that it was obligated under EU law to initiate the German Proceedings.64 As set out by the Netherlands, in its judgment concerning an intra-EU BIT arbitration in *Achmea*, confirmed in *Komstroy* in connection with an ECT arbitration,65 the CJEU held that EU Member States are under an obligation not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of EU law to any method of settlement other than those provided for in the EU Treaties. The Netherlands further relies upon *PL Holdings v Poland*, in which the CJEU held that when a dispute is submitted to arbitration on the basis of an agreement that is contrary to EU law, EU Member States \"are required to challenge, before that arbitration body or before the court with jurisdiction, the validity of the arbitration.\"66 The European Commission has taken the same view, announcing that the Netherlands' EU law obligations \"include challenging, before the court with jurisdiction (in casu, the German Courts), the validity of the arbitration clause.\"67 The European Commission further indicated that if the Netherlands were to \"cease the German proceedings, the Commission could open a procedure pursuant to the [EU] Treaties in order to assess the compatibility of such an action with EU law.\"68\n\nRejoinder, paras 24-32.\n\n**CL-12**, ECJ, Judgment of 2 September 2021, *Komstroy*, ECLIEUC2021655, 02 September 2021, para. 42.\n\nRejoinder, para 25, *quoting* **CL-150**, ECJ, C-109/20, Judgment of 26 October 2021 (*Republiken Polen v.

This is clear, says the Netherlands, from its statements to the court. For example, the Netherlands has submitted that \"the question before this Court \u2026 is not one of the ICSID Convention, but rather one of EU and German law,\"69 and that the court can decide \"exclusively on the basis of Union law and German law.\"70 Thus, while the Cologne Court will provide clarity on the EU law question, it will not rule on the Tribunal's competence under the ICSID Convention or the ECT.\n\nResponse, para 28, *quoting* **R-6**, The Netherlands' submission to the German Court, 29 September 2021, para 5.\n\nResponse, para 28, *quoting* **C-129**, Respondent's opposition to RWE AG's suspension application in the German Proceedings, 31 January 2022.\n\n58.\n\nThe Netherlands further contends that, as a matter of German law, the German Proceedings do not impinge on the Tribunal's competence to decide its own jurisdiction or its ability to issue an award. Rather, Article 1032 of the German ZPO is designed to co-exist with the *kompetenz-kompetenz* of arbitral tribunals. Article 1032(3) expressly provides that when a court action is brought under Article 1032, \"arbitral proceedings may nevertheless be commenced or continued, and an arbitral award may be made, while the issue is pending before the court,\" and nothing in the ZPO prevents a tribunal from deciding on its own jurisdiction after the court renders its judgment.71\n\nResponse, para 58, *quoting* Article 1032(3) ZPO.\n\n59.\n\nThe Netherlands stresses that the relief it seeks in the German Proceedings is only declaratory in nature.72 The German Proceedings are not injunctive proceedings and will not interfere with RWE's ability to participate in this arbitration. The Netherlands points out its confirmation to RWE on 22 March 2022 that it \"has no intention to preclude the RWE Claimants from continuing to participate in the arbitration.\"73 The Netherlands also reaffirms that it will continue to participate in the ICSID proceedings while the German Proceedings are pending, and adds that \"it will continue to do so once those proceedings have been concluded, regardless of their outcome.\"74 According to the Netherlands, all it intends to do with the Cologne Court judgment is to brief the Tribunal on whether EU law permits or precludes intra-EU investor-State arbitration in this case.75\n\nResponse, paras 30-36.\n\nResponse, para 34, *quoting* **C-131**, Respondent's answer to Claimants' letter of 23 February 2022 concerning the German Proceedings, 22 March 2022.\n\nResponse, para 33.\n\nResponse, para 35.\n\n60.\n\nIn similar vein, the Netherlands states that it is acting in good faith to comply with its obligations under the ICSID Convention and will continue to do so regardless of what the German courts may decide. According to the Netherlands, the Tribunal recognized this approach as \"credible and reasonable\" in PO2, and no new facts or circumstances have arisen since to require any urgent intervention or a reversal of the Tribunal's earlier findings.76\n\nResponse, para 35, *quoting* PO2, para 51.\n\n61.\n\nFinally, the Netherlands points out that the Claimant RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV itself has initiated parallel court proceedings in the Netherlands, seeking declaratory and monetary relief in relation to the same events at issue in this arbitration. As discussed below, the Netherlands considers that RWE's conduct further undermines the Request.\n\n***3. Whether Provisional Measures are Warranted***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nApplying the legal standard for provisional measures, the Netherlands first contends that RWE has failed to identify any right in need of protection by provisional measures.77 In the Netherlands' view, the German Proceedings do not violate any of RWE's rights and are entirely consistent with Articles 41 and 26 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nResponse, para 37.\n\n63.\n\nRegarding Article 41, the Netherlands accepts that this provision grants the Tribunal the authority to decide on its own competence, but states that \"it does not provide that the Tribunal has the *exclusive* authority to decide on all matters that may be relevant to its decision on competence.\"78 As stated by Professor Schreuer: \"Under certain circumstances, a domestic court's decision may be preliminary to an issue of jurisdiction to be decided by an ICSID tribunal.\"79 Thus, the tribunal in *SPP v Egypt* chose to stay the arbitration pending a decision by the French courts on the preliminary question of whether another method of dispute resolution \u2013 ICC arbitration \u2013 had been agreed.80 As noted above, the Netherlands' view is that the Tribunal retains the authority to decide on its own competence regardless of the outcome of the German Proceedings. The Netherlands concludes that \"the relationship between Article 1032(2) ZPO and Article 41 ICSID Convention is one of coexistence, not conflict.\"81\n\nResponse, para 49.\n\nResponse, para 51, *quoting* **RL-2**, Christoph Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclair. The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd ed.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1 January 2009, p 522.\n\nResponse, paras 49-50, *citing* **RL-13**, *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, Decision on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 27 November 1985, paras 79-86.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 3.2 (heading).\n\n64.\n\nThe Netherlands also denies that the German Proceedings violate the exclusive remedies clause in Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. According to the Netherlands, Article 26 does not apply to the German Proceedings because, among other things: (a) exclusivity applies only if there is consent to ICSID arbitration; (b) exclusivity cannot apply to the interpretation and application of rights and obligations of EU Member States under the EU Treaties; and (c) the issue of interpretation and application of the EU Treaties that is before the German courts is not before the Tribunal.82 In any event, the Netherlands argues that by commencing the Dutch Proceedings, RWE has \"consent[ed] to derogate from ICSID exclusivity as far as proceedings before the Parties' domestic courts are concerned,\" and waived any right to exclusivity by pursuing its claim for monetary compensation in both fora.83\n\nResponse, paras 59-86.\n\nResponse, paras 67-74.\n\n65.\n\nThe Netherlands also denies RWE's allegations that the German Proceedings affect the integrity of this arbitration or deprive RWE of an alleged general right of access to arbitration under the ECT.84\n\nResponse, paras 87-95.\n\n66.\n\nTurning to the criteria for provisional measures, the Netherlands offers several arguments as to why the requested measures are neither necessary nor urgent. First, the Netherlands says RWE has failed to explain how the German Proceedings would prevent participation in this arbitration, instead resorting only to unsupported inferences about hypothetical follow-on proceedings for an anti-arbitration injunction.85 This is not a valid basis for provisional measures, as confirmed by the tribunal in *Occidental v Ecuador*, which stated that \"[p]rovisional measures are not meant to protect against any potential or hypothetical harm susceptible to result from uncertain actions.\"86\n\nResponse, para 103; Rejoinder, paras 18-19.\n\nResponse, para 103, *quoting* **RL-26**, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on provisional measures dated 17 August 2007, para 89.\n\n67.\n\nSecond, the Netherlands asserts that RWE's own conduct confirms the lack of necessity and urgency. RWE has been aware of the German Proceedings since May 2021, and yet took no steps to seek a stay of the German Proceedings until December 2021 and then waited almost a year to request provisional measures from the Tribunal. In the Netherlands' view, RWE would have acted promptly if it were concerned about actual and imminent harm necessitating urgent relief.87\n\nResponse, para 104; Rejoinder, para 22.\n\n68.\n\nThird, the Netherlands notes that RWE has asserted an additional claim in its Memorial seeking declaratory and monetary relief for purported breaches of the ICSID Convention arising out of the German Proceedings. For the Netherlands, this shows that RWE believes any alleged harm *can* be addressed in a final award, and that the Request is therefore not urgent.88\n\nResponse, para 105.\n\n69.\n\nThe Netherlands also sees the requested measures as disproportionate, with the negative impact of granting the measures far outweighing that of denying the Request. The Netherlands contends that if the Request were granted, the Tribunal would lose the benefit of a competent court's guidance on EU law and thus assume the role of interpreting the EU Treaties, which fall outside of its jurisdiction.89 For its part, the Netherlands contends that it would be deprived of its right as an EU Member State to access EU courts to resolve an issue of interpretation of EU law, and would also be required to violate its obligations under the EU Treaties and could become the subject of infringement proceedings under EU law.90 According to the Netherlands, this would be extraordinary, as \"[t]here is, understandably, no precedent for an ICSID tribunal using its power to recommend provisional measures that would call on a State to breach its obligations under another treaty.\"91\n\nRejoinder, para 33.\n\nRejoinder, paras 24-32.\n\nResponse, para 9.\n\n70.\n\nIn contrast, says the Netherlands, RWE has failed to identify any harm it would suffer from the German Proceedings. Instead, the German Proceedings will result in a declaratory judgment from the first Claimant's home jurisdiction that merely affirms obligations that have always existed under the EU Treaties.92\n\nResponse, para 107; Rejoinder, para 34.\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nBefore proceeding to its analysis of the Parties' positions, the Tribunal emphasizes that the purpose of this Decision is to determine whether the provisional measures requested by RWE are warranted in this case. The Tribunal makes no decision at this stage on the underlying jurisdictional issues or any question of the merits. Further, the Tribunal's analysis is necessarily based on the Tribunal's understanding of the record as it presently stands and should not be understood to preempt any later or different finding of fact or conclusion of law.\n\n**A. A****pplicable** **S****tandards**\n---------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal confirms its discretionary authority under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and the corresponding ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1) to recommend provisional measures.\n\n73.\n\nArticle 47 provides:\n\n*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.*\n\nArbitration Rule 39(1) provides:\n\n*At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.*\n\n74.\n\nThe ECT is silent on provisional measures and there is no suggestion of any other agreement between the Parties limiting the Tribunal's authority to recommend provisional measures.\n\n75.\n\nIn this case, the rights identified by the Claimants for preservation are their rights to pursue this ICSID arbitration as the exclusive forum for the dispute under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention; the Tribunal's exclusive *kompetenz-kompetenz* under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention; and the integrity of this arbitration, including RWE's right to full participation in this arbitration. As asserted by the Netherlands, citing *Maffezini v Spain*, the Claimants must establish the circumstances warranting the provisional measures they request to protect these rights.93\n\n**RL-24**, *Emilio August\u00edn Maffezini v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2 dated 28 October 1999, para 10.\n\n76.\n\nThe Parties recognize that, in exercising its discretionary authority to recommend provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1), the Tribunal is to consider the following criteria: (a) whether the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction over the Parties' dispute; (b) whether the Claimants have established a *prima facie* case on the merits; (c) the urgency and necessity of the measures requested; and (d) the proportionality of those measures.94\n\nAmong other authorities, **CL-168**, *United Utilities (Tallinn) B.V. and Aktsiaselts Tallinna Vesi v.*  \n*Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/24, Decision on Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, 12 May 2016, para 78.\n\n**B. A****nalysis of the** **C****laimants****' R****equest**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nStarting with the important first criterion of the test for provisional measures, the Tribunal is readily satisfied of its *prima facie* jurisdiction over the Parties' dispute. The Claimants have a *prima facie* right to pursue arbitration under the ICSID Convention and the ECT, which have been ratified by both Germany and the Netherlands. The Netherlands has provided advance notification of its intention to raise an intra-EU jurisdictional objection, for decision by the Tribunal. Although the Tribunal in no way prejudges the outcome of this objection, it sees no facially obvious defect that would deprive it of *prima facie* jurisdiction to proceed with the provisional measures analysis.\n\n78.\n\nIn related vein, the Tribunal is also readily satisfied that the second criterion of the test for provisional measures is met. RWE has set out *prima facie* claims on the merits for violation of the ECT in its Memorial, which \u2013 should the Tribunal find that it has jurisdiction \u2013 RWE will have to prove against the Netherlands' defenses.\n\n79.\n\nAs an introduction to the remaining criteria in the test for provisional measures \u2013 urgency and necessity and proportionality \u2013 the Tribunal wishes to record its appreciation of the difficulty of the decision before it.\n\n80.\n\nOn the one hand, the Tribunal has substantial sympathy for RWE's argument that the Netherlands' German Proceedings are part of a strategy to end this arbitration and thus present a \"danger to this arbitration [that] is not merely theoretical.\"95 On the other hand, the Tribunal appreciates the Netherlands' concern with its obligations under the Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union as an EU Member State.\n\nRequest, \u00a7 II (Heading) and para 32; Reply, para 46.\n\n81.\n\nTurning first to RWE's position, the Tribunal recognizes the danger inherent in proceedings under Section 1032(2) of the German ZPO in connection with an ICSID arbitration, given the a-national nature of ICSID proceedings under the ICSID Convention. If the Cologne Court, or the Federal Court of Justice on appeal, should decide that the Parties' arbitration agreement arising under the ECT is invalid and this arbitration is inadmissible, it follows that the judgment would be binding under German law on the parties \u2013 RWE AG and the Netherlands \u2013 and that the effect would not necessarily be limited to EU law. RWE AG emphasizes that it would then face the follow-on risk that the judgment could be used to obtain an anti-arbitration injunction forcing it to withdraw from this arbitration and/or to block enforcement of a final award in this arbitration. It is difficult to ignore the prediction of the European Commission's Mr Maxian Rusche that the basis for such an anti-arbitration injunction would be that \"the investor commits a tort by violating a final determination of a court.\"96 To repeat RWE's words, the Tribunal can appreciate that these risks posed by the application of Section 1032(2) of the German ZPO are not \"merely theoretical.\"\n\n**C-125**, Maxian Rusche, IPRax 2021, 494, pp 501-502.\n\n82.\n\nNor would the impact on this Tribunal be \"merely theoretical.\" The relief expressly requested in the German Proceedings is, after all, a declaration that this arbitration is inadmissible. Even the issuance of, in the Respondent's description, \"only\" a declaratory judgment focused on EU law in the *Achmea/Komstroy* vein, would pose some level of clear threat to the Tribunal's exclusive competence to determine its own jurisdiction under Articles 26 and 41 of the ICSID Convention and, if followed by anti-arbitration injunction proceedings as RWE predicts, to RWE's right of access to ICSID arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT and to the integrity of a-national ICSID proceedings.\n\n83.\n\nAt the same time, however, the Tribunal must appreciate the responsibilities and pressures facing the Netherlands as the sovereign Party to this arbitration. The Tribunal is reluctant to second-guess the Netherlands' position, relying on the CJEU's decision in *PL Holdings v Poland*, that it was obligated under EU law to initiate the German Proceedings to challenge the validity of an arbitration that is potentially contrary to EU law.97 In this regard, the Tribunal notes the indication of the European Commission that if the Netherlands were to \"cease the German proceedings, the Commission could open a procedure pursuant to the [EU] Treaties in order to assess the compatibility of such an action with EU law.\"98\n\n**CL-150**, ECJ, C-109/20, Judgment of 26 October 2021 (*Republiken Polen v. PL Holdings S\u00e0rl*), 26 October 2021, para 52.\n\n**R-12**, Letter from the European Commission to the Netherlands, 4 March 2022, para 13.\n\n84.\n\nNor is the Tribunal prepared to second-guess the Netherlands' submissions to the Cologne Court that \"the question before [the court] \u2026 is not one of the ICSID Convention, but rather one of EU and German law,\"99 or its representations in this case that the Cologne Court will not rule on the Tribunal's competence under the ICSID Convention or the ECT.\n\n**R-6**, The Netherlands' submission to the German Court, 29 September 2021, para 5.\n\n85.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal must accept for now the Netherlands' confirmation to RWE on 22 March 2022 that it \"has no intention to preclude the RWE Claimants from continuing to participate in the arbitration\"100 and its reaffirmation that it will continue to participate in this arbitration not only while the German Proceedings are pending but also \"once those proceedings have been concluded, regardless of their outcome.\"101 Having said that, the Tribunal cannot be unaware that, to the extent the Netherlands insists that all it intends to do with the Cologne Court judgment, when issued, is to brief the Tribunal on whether EU law permits or precludes intra-EU investor-State arbitration in this case,102 the Netherlands' position following a Cologne Court judgment that this arbitration is inadmissible likely will be to challenge the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n**C-131**, Respondent's answer to Claimants' letter of 23 February 2022 concerning the German Proceedings, 22 March 2022.\n\nResponse, para 33.\n\nResponse, para 35.\n\n86.\n\nOn balance, despite the statement of Mr Maxian Rusche quoted by RWE and the representation made by Netherlands' counsel to the Cologne Court that, \"[i]f anything, the ICSID Arbitral Tribunal would be required to suspend its proceedings, as its jurisdiction depends on the existence of an effective arbitration agreement,\"103 the Tribunal will continue to rely on the Netherlands' assurances that an \"inadmissibility\" decision in the German Proceedings will be limited to a declaratory judgment that is itself limited to EU law. The Tribunal repeats and emphasizes its understanding as set out in PO2 in February 2022 that such positive statements of the Netherlands are \"assurances that it will not take any steps to interfere with the Tribunal's *kompetenz-kompetenz*.\"104 The Tribunal also notes the similar positive representations of the Netherlands that were recited and relied upon by the tribunal in the ICSID case of *Uniper v Netherlands* in its decision addressing the claimant's request for provisional measures:105\n\n*In response to these arguments and to questions from the Tribunal, the Respondent's representatives made a number of representations to the Tribunal during the Hearing on Provisional Measures. In particular, the Respondent made the following representations:*\n\n*\u2022 That the Kingdom of the Netherlands intends to comply with all of its obligations under international law, including the ICSID Convention and the ECT;*\n\n*\u2022 That it is under an obligation to question the validity of the arbitration agreement contained in Article 26 of the ECT before an EU court, as this is mandatory and required by the Respondent's EU law obligations stemming from Article 344 of the TFEU, the Treaties more generally, the jurisprudence of the CJEU and the direct obligations imposed by the European Commission;*\n\n*\u2022 That in the German Proceedings,*\n\n*i. It seeks only a declaration as to EU law, as required by its understanding of its EU Treaty obligations;*\n\n*ii. It does not seek determinations under the ICSID Convention; and*\n\n*iii. As noted above, it has expressly advised the German Court of this position, specifically stating to the German Court that the Court is not called upon to decide a question of the ICSID Convention, but to clarify a question of EU law and German law;*\n\n*\u2022 That the ECT is a source of international law and identifies the body competent to determine jurisdiction under that treaty;*\n\n*\u2022 That this Tribunal is the body competent to determine its own jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and that it may take into consideration the forthcoming judgment of the German Court and judgments of the CJEU;*\n\n*\u2022 That it will not argue before any forum that any decision that might be rendered by the German Court constitutes anything other than a declaration under EU law; and*\n\n*\u2022 That the declaration if granted, in and of itself, will not have any effect on any of the Claimants' ability to continue participating in the ICSID proceedings, as there is neither a concept of contempt of court under German law, nor is the Respondent seeking any injunctive or similar relief.*\n\n**C-129**, Respondent's opposition to RWE AG's suspension application in the German Proceedings, 31 January 2022, para 12.\n\nPO2, paras 48-49.\n\n**CL-173**, *Uniper SE and others. v. The Netherlands*, ICSID Case No. ARB/21/22, Procedural Order No. 2: Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures (with reasons) dated 9 May 2022, para 93 (footnotes omitted).\n\n87.\n\nMost important to the decision at hand, the discussion above is self-evidently and necessarily speculative. The Cologne Court has not yet ruled on the Netherlands' action or RWE's suspension request; an anti-arbitration injunction application following a suspension order remains a possibility; and the outcome of the likely appellate process cannot be predicted. As the Claimants themselves point out, in the context of describing the limited \"legal or informative value of a Cologne decision\" to explain the Netherlands' intra-EU objection in this arbitration, the Cologne Court decision \"will not immediately become binding\" and the likely appeal by the loser to the Federal Supreme Court may take a year or longer.106\n\nReply, para 12.\n\n88.\n\nIn light of the present uncertainties, and particularly in light of the Netherlands' many affirmative statements, the Tribunal cannot find at the present time that the German Proceedings infringe on its exclusive authority to determine its own competence under the ICSID Convention, the Claimants' substantive rights, or the procedural integrity of this arbitration.\n\n89.\n\nThis means that, even accepting that the Claimants could make a case for a proportionate burden of the provisional measures if granted, the Claimants have not demonstrated that the measures are either urgent or necessary at the present time. As stated by the tribunal in *Occidental v Ecuador*, \"[p]rovisional measures are not meant to protect against any potential or hypothetical harm susceptible to result from uncertain actions.\"107\n\n**RL-26**, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on provisional measures dated 17 August 2007, para 89.\n\n90.\n\nAccordingly, under the present circumstances, the Tribunal has determined, with some hesitation, not to grant RWE's request for an order that the Netherlands withdraw or suspend the German Proceedings immediately.\n\n91.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal well recognizes that these present circumstances may change in the near future. In particular, if, in the wake of a judgment in the German Proceedings finding this ICSID arbitration \"inadmissible\" by operation of Section 1032(2) of the German ZPO, RWE faces an anti-arbitration injunction application or a serious threat of such an application, the Tribunal would entertain a renewed request for provisional measures on an expedited basis. The Tribunal would have to decide whether, under the specific situation presented at such a time, to recommend provisional measures to preserve RWE's rights to pursue this ICSID arbitration and the Tribunal's exclusive right to determine its jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention. To this end, the Tribunal recommends that the Netherlands not aggravate this dispute by seeking \u2013 contrary to its stated intentions108 \u2013 to restrain the Claimants from participating fully in this arbitration, whether by injunctive relief in the German courts or any other action, either before or after any decision in the current German Proceedings, without first providing sufficient notice to the Claimants of its intention to do so such as to allow a renewed application for provisional measures to this Tribunal.\n\nResponse, para 34; **C-131**, Respondent's answer to Claimants' letter of 23 February 2022 concerning the German Proceedings, 22 March 2022.\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes by noting one thing that is certain at the present time: the CJEU has now ruled in *Komstroy* that intra-EU arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT is incompatible with EU law. The Netherlands will have a full opportunity to brief the Tribunal on this issue when asserting its intra-EU jurisdictional objection. There would seem to be no further purpose, therefore, to the continuation of the German Proceedings. The Tribunal joins the *Uniper v Netherlands* tribunal in strongly recommending that the Netherlands reconsider whether its pursuit of the German Proceedings remains necessary or appropriate.\n\n**VI. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n93.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal **DECIDES** and **ORDERS** as follows:\n\n(A) The Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures ordering the Respondent immediately to withdraw or discontinue the German Proceedings or, alternatively, to suspend the German Proceedings pending the Tribunal's award in this arbitration, is **denied** at this time;\n\n(B) The Tribunal **recommends** that the Respondent not aggravate this dispute by seeking to restrain the Claimants from participating fully in this arbitration, whether by injunctive relief in the German courts or any other action, either before or after any decision in the current German Proceedings, without first providing sufficient notice to the Claimants of its intention to do so such as to allow a renewed application for provisional measures to this Tribunal;\n\n(C) The Tribunal **recommends** that the Respondent reconsider the necessity and appropriateness of continuing the proceedings before the Cologne Court, as the Parties do not dispute that the Court of Justice of the European Union has determined that Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty should be interpreted so as not to apply to intra-EU disputes;\n\n(D) The Tribunal **recommends** that the Respondent communicate this Decision to the Higher Regional Court of Cologne; and\n\n(E) The issue of costs is **reserved** to a later stage of the arbitration.\n\nDate: 16 August 2022"}, {"Title": "Order of the Tribunal Taking Note of the Discontinuance of the Proceeding and Decision on Costs", "Type": "Costs", "Date": "2024-01-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Order of the Tribunal Taking Note of the Discontinuance of the Proceeding and Decision on Costs\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 20 January 2021, RWE A.G., a public limited company incorporated under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, with its registered address in Essen, Germany, and RWE Eemshaven Holding II B.V., a Besloten Vennootschap (or limited liability) company incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of the Netherlands with its registered address in Geertruidenberg, Netherlands (the \"**Claimants**\" or \"**RWE**\"), filed its Request for Arbitration (the \"**Request**\") with the Secretariat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") pursuant to Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty (the \"**ECT**\") and Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Request was filed against the Kingdom of the Netherlands (the \"**Respondent**\" or the \"**Netherlands**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration on 2 February 2021 pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and Rules 6(1)(a) and 7(a) of the ICSID Institution Rules and notified the Parties of the registration.\n\n4.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with the following method: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party, the third arbitrator, and President of the Tribunal to be appointed according to a list procedure.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Ms. Lucy Reed, a national of the United States of America, President, appointed by the Parties; Mr. James Boykin, a national of the United States of America, appointed by the Claimants; and Mr. Toby Landau KC, a national of the United Kingdom, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n6.\n\nOn 2 June 2021, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\") notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date, pursuant to the Parties' agreement on the constitution of the Tribunal and the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. Dr. Jonathan Chevry, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn 30 August 2021, the Tribunal held a First Session with the Parties by videoconference.\n\n8.\n\nOn 15 October 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, setting out the procedural rules and procedural calendar for the proceedings.\n\n9.\n\nOn 18 December 2021, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits, accompanied by two expert reports.\n\n10.\n\nOn 28 January 2022, the Claimants filed a request to address an objection to jurisdiction and an ancillary claim as preliminary questions (the \"**Claimants' Application for Bifurcation and Expedition**\").\n\n11.\n\nOn 11 February 2022, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimants' Application for Bifurcation and Expedition.\n\n12.\n\nOn 25 February 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 rejecting the Claimants' request to address an objection to jurisdiction and an ancillary claim as preliminary questions. As a result, the arbitration proceeded in accordance with the procedural timetable for non-bifurcated proceedings.\n\n13.\n\nOn 29 April 2022, the Claimants filed a request for provisional measures.\n\n14.\n\nOn 3 May 2022, the Respondent filed observations on the admissibility of the Claimants' request for provisional measures.\n\n15.\n\nOn 9 May 2022, the Claimants filed a response to the Respondent's observations of 3 May 2022.\n\n16.\n\nOn 17 May 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, deciding that the Claimants' request for provisional measures was admissible and establishing a briefing schedule on the Claimants' request.\n\n17.\n\nOn 31 May 2022, the Respondent filed a response to the Claimants' request for provisional measures.\n\n18.\n\nOn 7 June 2022, the Claimants filed observations on the Respondent's response of 31 May 2022.\n\n19.\n\nOn 14 June 2022, the Respondent filed a rejoinder to the Claimants' request for provisional measures.\n\n20.\n\nOn 16 August 2022, the Tribunal issued its Decision on provisional measures, rejecting the Claimants' request and issuing a series of recommendations for the Respondent.\n\n21.\n\nOn 5 September 2022, the Respondent filed its Counter-memorial on the Merits and Jurisdiction, accompanied by one expert report.\n\n22.\n\nBy email of 19 October 2022, the Claimants informed the Tribunal of the Parties' agreement of 18 October 2022 to suspend the arbitration with \"immediate effect\" and on the following terms:\n\n*1. The suspension has an initial period of nine months starting as of 18 October 2022 and may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, provided that the suspension will end once the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) publishes its decision on the appeal pending between the parties.*\n\n*2. For the purposes of this suspension, ICSID Arbitration Rule*\n\n*45 does not apply.*\n\n*3. Once the arbitration continues, the Procedural Calendar will need to be reviewed (e.g. finding a new hearing date and checking the schedule in light of holiday periods and conflicts with other commitments); and*\n\n*4. To enable this and to account for the additional time needed to recommence ongoing workstreams, the first deadline following the restart of the arbitration will in any event be extended by two weeks.*\n\n23.\n\nBy email of the same day, the Respondent confirmed its agreement with the content of the Claimants' email.\n\n24.\n\nOn 20 October 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 taking note of the Parties' agreement to suspend the proceeding for a period of nine months.\n\n25.\n\nOn 20 June 2023, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to extend the suspension of the proceeding until 15 September 2023. The Respondent confirmed the Parties' agreement by email of the same date.\n\n**II. DISCONTINUANCE**\n----------------------\n\n26.\n\nBy email of 18 September 2023, the Claimants observed that \"as the Tribunal is likely aware, the German Federal Court of Justice declared the present arbitration inadmissible under German and European law\" and that the RWE board was expected to decide in the next month whether to discontinue the present proceeding.\n\n27.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants informed the Tribunal of the Parties' agreement to extend the suspension of the proceeding until 16 October 2023. RWE noted that \"[t]he Parties have further agreed that the suspension is without prejudice to the right of the Parties to jointly or individually request the discontinuance of the proceedings during the pendency of the suspension.\"\n\n28.\n\nBy letter of 16 October 2023, RWE formally requested the discontinuance of the proceeding pursuant to Rule 44 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n29.\n\nRule 44 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides:\n\nIf a party requests the discontinuance of the proceeding, the Tribunal, or the Secretary-General if the Tribunal has not yet been constituted, shall in an order fix a time limit within which the other party may state whether it opposes the discontinuance. If no objection is made in writing within the time limit, the other party shall be deemed to have acquiesced in the discontinuance and the Tribunal, or if appropriate the Secretary-General, shall in an order take note of the discontinuance of the proceeding. If objection is made, the proceeding shall continue.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of 17 October 2023, in accordance with Rule 44 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to state by 27 October 2023 whether it opposed the discontinuance of the proceeding.\n\n31.\n\nBy letter of 20 October 2023, the Netherlands noted that it \"agrees with Claimants that the declaration of the present arbitration by the German Federal Court of Justice as inadmissible compels its discontinuance\" and confirmed its consent to the discontinuance of the proceeding.\n\n32.\n\nAs a result, in accordance with the Parties' request and pursuant to Rule 44 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal hereby takes note of the discontinuance of the proceeding.\n\n**III. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n33.\n\nIn its letter of 20 October 2023, the Netherlands also observed that RWE's request of 16 October 2023 did not address the issue of allocation of costs between the Parties and requested this issue to be addressed in a schedule of simultaneous written submissions.\n\n34.\n\nOn 24 October 2023, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to address the issue of costs allocation by 8 November 2023 in a submission not exceeding 10 pages, and invited the Claimants to comment on the Respondent's submission on costs by 22 November 2023.\n\n35.\n\nOn 8 November 2023, the Respondent filed its submission on costs (the \"**Respondent's Submission on Costs**\"), along with the Affidavit of [REDACTED] the Senior Legal Advisor at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate of the Netherlands (\"[REDACTED] **Affidavit**\") setting out the costs claimed. The Respondent requested the Tribunal to order the Claimants to bear the Netherlands' costs in this proceeding as described in the [REDACTED] Affidavit, in full or in substantial part.\n\n36.\n\nOn 22 November 2023, the Claimants provided their comments on the Respondent's Submission on Costs (the \"**Claimants' Comments on Costs**\").\n\n37.\n\nBy email dated 27 November 2023, the Netherlands stated that the representation in RWE's Comments on Costs that it had not reached out to RWE to try to reach an agreement on costs is false, as evidenced by an attached email of 31 August 2023.\n\n**A. The Parties' Positions on Costs**\n--------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe presentations of the Parties' positions in the sections below are not meant to serve as an exhaustive review of the Parties' submissions on the Respondent's request for costs, but rather as summaries of those arguments that are relevant to the Tribunal's analysis and findings on the allocation of costs. The Tribunal has carefully considered the written statements made by the Parties and the authorities referred to by them.\n\n**(1) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent seeks the legal and arbitration costs it has incurred through the discontinuance of this arbitration. The Respondent notes, in particular, that the Tribunal reserved costs issues in connection with its decisions denying the Claimants' requests for bifurcation and provisional measures.1\n\nProcedural Order No. 2: Decision on Bifurcation (25 February 2022), para 59(C); Decision on Provisional Measures (16 August 2022), para. 93(E).\n\n40.\n\nAcknowledging the tribunal's refusal to grant costs in *Uniper v. Netherlands*,2 the Netherlands summarizes its position as follows:3\n\n*The Netherlands has incurred significant expenses in this arbitration, to the detriment of Dutch taxpayers. The Netherlands accordingly asserts that, in view of the exceptional circumstances of this case, it is appropriate for it to receive compensation for the fees and expenses it was forced to bear. It was required to defend against requests for bifurcation and provisional measures. It was required to prepare a voluminous Counter-Memorial accompanied by, inter alia, an expert report and significant technical evidence. It was finally required to unnecessarily prepare for the resumption of the proceedings, and the ensuing document production phase. All these costs were incurred, and yet they leave the Parties exactly where they began more than three years ago: with Claimants' identical ECT claims, only now before the Dutch courts. Regrettably, at no time during these three years did Claimants act in a way that would mitigate the Netherlands' financial exposure. In these \"exceptional circumstances,\" which stand in stark contrast to those pertaining to the Uniper proceedings arising from a similar factual context, it is only fair and just that Claimants should bear all or a substantial part of Respondent's financial burden in this arbitration.*\n\n*Uniper SE, Uniper Benelux Holding B.V. and Uniper Benelux N.V. v. the Kingdom of the Netherlands*, ICSID Case No. ARB/21/22, Order of the Tribunal Taking Note of the Discontinuance of the Proceedings and Decision on Costs (17 March 2023), para. 71.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, 8 November 2023 (\"**Respondent's Costs Submission**\"), para. 3 (footnote omitted).\n\n41.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal has the power to order a party to bear the costs of the other party, whether pursuant to the ICSID Arbitration Rules, its inherent powers or, here, Article 28 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n42.\n\nIn support, the Netherlands contends that \"ICSID tribunals and annulment committees have repeatedly affirmed their power to award costs in the particular context of a request for discontinuance.\"4 For example, the annulment committee in *ATA v. Jordan* noted that, although a decision on costs \"is normally taken in an award \u2026 in case of discontinuance of the proceedings, it can be done in the Order noting the discontinuance.\"5 The tribunal in *Quadrant v. Costa Rica* observed that because \"nothing in the rules governing this proceeding preclude the Tribunal from deciding on the allocation of the advance payments and costs of this truncated proceeding,\" it could make an allocation of costs in a discontinuance order.6\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, para 7.\n\n*ATA Construction, Industrial and Trading Company v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/2, Order Taking Note of the Discontinuance of the Proceedings (11 July 2011), para. 24.\n\n*Quadrant Pacific Growth Fund L.P. and Canasco Holdings Inc*. *v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/08/01, Order of the Tribunal Taking Note of the Discontinuance of the Proceeding and Allocation of Costs (27 October 2010) (\"***Quadrant***\"), para. 6.6.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent further explains that ICSID tribunals and annulment committees have based their allocation of costs in discontinuance orders on a number of factors. For example, in *RSM v. Grenada*, the annulment committee noted the exceptional circumstances of RSM having failed to pay its advance on costs while also (with other shareholders) commencing a separate proceeding against Grenada.7 In *Quadrant*, the tribunal noted the factors of \"a party's bad faith, lack of cooperation, dilatory or otherwise improper conduct.\"8\n\n*RSM Production Corporation v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/14, Order of the Committee Discontinuing the Proceedings and Decision on Costs (28 April 2011), para. 65.\n\n*Quadrant*, para. 67.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent asks the Tribunal, in applying such factors, to order the Claimants to pay all or a substantial portion of its costs. Among other reasons, RWE unnecessarily increased the costs of this arbitration by, first, unsuccessfully pursuing an application, which the Tribunal noted to be in an \"unusual procedural posture,\" to bifurcate the Netherland's intra-EU objection before the Netherlands filed such an objection9 and, second, unsuccessfully applying for provisional measures to cause the Netherlands to withdraw or suspend the German court proceedings. The Respondent also charges the Claimants with \"act[ing] with a plain lack of transparency\" in \"fail[ing] to notify the Netherlands and the Tribunal of their intention to assert the very same claims before Dutch courts, and otherwise act[ing] as though the arbitration proceedings would resume,\"10 even after the 27 July 2023 decision of the German Federal Supreme Court that these proceedings are inadmissible under German and European law. As a consequence of RWE's overall conduct, says the Netherlands, it incurred unnecessary legal expenses to oppose the bifurcation and provisional measures applications and had no choice but to prepare a full Counter-Memorial with technical and expert evidence and commence the document production phase. In comparison, the proceedings in the *Uniper v. Netherlands* arbitration were at a very early stage before Uniper sought discontinuance.\n\nProcedural Order No. 2: Decision on Bifurcation, para. 50.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, para. 24.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent argues, in conclusion, that \"[b]y any standard, Claimants' requests for bifurcation and provisional measures, belated request for discontinuance on the basis of facts that had long been anticipated, and failure to act transparently constitute 'exceptional circumstances' that warrant the allocation of costs in favour of the Netherlands.\"11\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, para. 25.\n\n46.\n\nThe Netherlands requests total costs of EUR [REDACTED]. This amount appears in the [REDACTED] Affidavit, which is two pages long. [REDACTED] states as follows:12\n\n*I have reviewed the invoices prepared by Foley Hoag LLP, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek and other expenses in relation to this proceeding that were paid by Respondent. Respondent's costs in connection with this arbitration have been incurred in undertaking the following non-exhaustive list of activities necessary for the proper defense of Claimants' claims:*\n\n*\u2022 Research, meetings, drafting and correspondence in connection with the cooling off period.*\n\n*\u2022 Research, meetings, drafting and correspondence in connection with the constitution of the Tribunal.*\n\n*\u2022 Research, meetings, drafting and correspondence in connection with the Request for Bifurcation, Provisional Measures.*\n\n*\u2022 Research, meetings, drafting and correspondence in connection with the submission of the Counter-Memorial.*\n\n*\u2022 Research, meetings, drafting and correspondence with Compass Lexecon;*\n\n*\u2022 Research, meetings, drafting and correspondence in connection with the preparation of the Redfern Schedule.*\n\n*\u2022 Research and drafting in connection with Claimants' ECT claims submitted before the Hague Court of Appeal.*\n\n*\u2022 Conferrals relating to the suspension of the proceedings.*\n\n*\u2022 Research, meetings, drafting and correspondence in connection with the preparation of resumption of the proceedings, i.e. costs incurred in relation to the Document Production stage.*\n\n*\u2022 Conferrals relating to Claimants 'proposal to discontinue the arbitration proceedings.*\n\n*\u2022 Research and preparation of the Netherlands' cost submission.*\n\n*I hereby confirm that the following reflects the costs incurred by Respondent in this ICSLD proceeding:*\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Cost** |\n| ICSID advance payments | EUR [REDACTED] |\n| Legal representation and advice (ind. expert fee and other expenses, e.g., printing, translations, transport) | EUR [REDACTED] (De Brauw, includes expert fees, *e.g.* Compass Lexecon)1 EUR [REDACTED] |\n| Total | EUR [REDACTED] |\n\n*I believe that the statements made, and all calculations presented herein are true and accurate, and that all related calculations have been expressed correctly. I remain at the Arbitral Tribunal's disposal to provide a more detailed upon request.*\n\n[Footnote 1] *This amount includes fees of legal representation incurred in proceedings in the first instance of the German proceedings. It is estimated that at least* [REDACTED] *of this amount was incurred directly in connection with the ICSID proceedings. A detailed accounting can be provided upon the Tribunal's request.*\n\nAffidavit of [REDACTED], 8 November 2023.\n\n**(2) The Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn the Claimants' Comments on Costs, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to reject the Respondent's request for costs. Should the Tribunal determine to allocate costs, the Claimants \"reserve the right to file a detailed cost submission at a later point in time, if deemed necessary by the Tribunal.\"13\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, 22 November 2023 (\"**Claimants' Costs Submission**\"), para. 1.\n\n48.\n\nIn the Claimants' words, they \"limit [their] submission to whether the Tribunal has the power to allocate costs and, if so, to whom.\"14\n\nClaimants' Costs Submission, para. 1.\n\n49.\n\nRWE emphasizes that there is no express rule in the ICSID Convention or in the ICSID Arbitration Rules for allocation of costs following discontinuance. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) provide only that a tribunal may allocate costs in an award. RWE describes this as \"sensible since only awards are enforceable in national courts of ICSID Member States.\"15\n\nClaimants' Costs Submission, para. 9.\n\n50.\n\nAs for the Respondent's reliance on examples of discontinued arbitrations in which tribunals have awarded costs, RWE says that the Netherlands \"essentially repeats its own submissions in the parallel *Uniper* case\" where the \"tribunal quite correctly held that those decisions were based on an explicit or implied agreement of the parties.\"16 The Claimants emphasize that, where tribunals have allocated costs in discontinuance orders, they have done so on a case-by-case basis and only if: (a) the parties have reached an agreement on costs; (b) there was an additional legal basis, such as the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations and Additional Facility Rules in *Quadrant*; or (c) there were special circumstances such as bad faith, lack of cooperation, or overall improper conduct by a party. According to RWE, none of these factors is applicable here.\n\nClaimants' Costs Submission, para. 5.\n\n51.\n\nDespite their professed limitation to the argument that the Tribunal lacks power to allocate costs, the Claimants also allege that the \"Respondent's submission is a remarkable piece of procedural bad faith.\"17 In RWE's words:18\n\n*This proceeding has been discontinued since Respondent has successfully torpedoed this arbitration. It instituted the German Proceedings, alleging that they would only concern European law, although they necessarily had to deal with the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration. And this is also what happened: The German courts found Article 41 of the ICSID Convention to be inapplicable and, therefore, declared the present ICSID arbitration inadmissible. In addition, Respondent resisted bifurcation of these proceedings, which would have avoided a full submission on the merits and thereby reduced costs enormously.*\n\nClaimants' Costs Submission, para. 2.\n\nClaimants' Costs Submission, para. 2.\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimants object to the Respondent's \"first resort[ing] to measures violating the ICSID Convention and then request[ing] to be rewarded for doing so by being awarded costs.\"19 Citing to Bin Cheng, RWE contends that the Netherlands' \"[n]ow asking for an allocation of costs violates the fundamental principle that no one may profit from his own wrongdoing ('*nullus commodum capere de sua injuria propria*').\"20\n\nClaimants' Costs Submission, para. 3.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, para. 6, citing Bin Cheng, General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals (1953), p. 149ff.\n\n53.\n\nEven assuming that the Tribunal has the authority to allocate costs, the Claimants argue that there is no legal basis for such an allocation here. This is because, in its letter of 20 October 2023, the Respondent declared that it \"unconditionally consents to the discontinuance of the current proceedings,\" and the consequence under ICSID Arbitration Rule 44 is that \"the Tribunal [\u2026] shall in an order take note of the discontinuance of the proceeding.\"21\n\nClaimants' Costs Submission, para. 4.\n\n54.\n\nAs for the level of costs claimed by the Respondent at some EUR [REDACTED] , the Claimants note the impact of the Netherlands' change of legal counsel and experts after the first round of submissions. RWE puts the blame for the high legal costs claimed for preparation of the Counter-Memorial and other submissions on the Netherlands' own decisions to pursue the anti-arbitration injunction proceedings and resist early bifurcation.\n\n**B. The Tribunal's Analysis and Decision**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\n*The Tribunal's Jurisdiction to Order Costs:* The Tribunal begins with certain observations on the question of its authority to order the Claimants to pay costs to the Respondent as an element of the discontinuance order \u2013 albeit, as explained below, the Tribunal does not address this issue in detail and need not resolve it, in the circumstances of this case.\n\n56.\n\nAs noted in the Parties' submissions, ICSID tribunals and annulment committees have taken different approaches to this question.\n\n57.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent's reliance on Article 28.2 of Procedural Order No. 1. Article 28.2 provides (emphasis added):\n\n*The parties are to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the efficient use of time and resources and observe Tribunal directions, so as to enable the arbitration to proceed to the award in a proper, fair and efficient way. The Tribunal may take unreasonable behavior into account when **exercising its discretion** to allocate costs. Unreasonable behavior includes unjustified failure to meet deadlines in the Procedural Calendar or comply with other procedural orders, dilatory tactics, excessive document production requests, unnecessarily intemperate inter-lawyer correspondence, unnecessary legal argument, excessive cross-examination, patently exaggerated claims or unjustified interim applications.*\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Article 28.2 is not a source of authority for the Tribunal to allocate costs in this discontinuance order. Rather, Article 28.2 sets out standards of party conduct to guide the Tribunal in exercising its discretionary authority \u2013 whatever discretionary authority it may possess \u2013 in allocating costs.\n\n58.\n\nArticle 28.2 does not give the Tribunal any power that it otherwise lacks to allocate costs in a discontinuance order, as compared to costs allocation in an award under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal undoubtedly would have discretion to assess costs against RWE in an award in connection with their applications for bifurcation and provisional measures; indeed, as pointed out by the Netherlands, the Tribunal expressly reserved this authority in the relevant decisions. Despite these express reservations of authority, however, it does not necessarily follow that the Tribunal may allocate costs, not in an award, but in an order discontinuing the proceedings.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the possibility that the Parties have agreed, by implication, that it has the power to allocate costs in an order \"taking note of the discontinuance\" for purposes of Rule 44 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. It could be said that the Claimants have implicitly agreed with the Respondent that costs are allocable in light of the Claimants' statement that they \"reserve the right to file a detailed cost submission at a later point in time, if deemed necessary by the Tribunal.\"22\n\nClaimants' Costs Submission, para. 1.\n\n60.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal need not determine whether there was an agreement or not, because the Tribunal has determined to deny the Respondent's request for costs on separate grounds.\n\n61.\n\n*The Circumstances of this Case:* Most importantly, the Tribunal cannot ignore the circumstances leading to the Claimants' decision to discontinue this arbitration. That decision cannot be said to be truly voluntary.\n\n62.\n\nThe Netherlands chose to pursue its *Achmea/Komstroy* objection primarily through the German courts, by invoking a German procedural rule to obtain a decision that there was no valid arbitration agreement between the Netherlands and the Dutch and German RWE Claimants under the ECT following the September 2021 decision of the European Court of Justice in *Komstroy*. Once the German Federal Supreme Court affirmed that *Komstroy* requires the German courts to find the ECT arbitration agreement (as between EU member state parties) *void ab initio*, the Claimants' request for discontinuance followed.\n\n63.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it would be inequitable for the Claimants to have to bear the Respondent's costs in this arbitration. The Claimants initiated the arbitration in January 2021, in reliance on rights they believed they possessed under the ICSID Convention and the ECT before the September 2021 *Komstroy* decision. The Netherlands went outside the ICSID Convention regime to pursue its *Achmea/Komstroy* objection before the German courts. Having succeeded in establishing under German procedural law that this Tribunal effectively lacks jurisdiction, the Netherlands cannot fairly be allowed now to invoke the very jurisdiction it disavowed to claim its arbitration \u2013 and German court litigation \u2013 costs under the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules., and this Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 1. It is inherently contradictory for the Netherlands to challenge the jurisdiction of this ICSID Tribunal outside of the ICSID regime by proceeding before the EU domestic courts and then come back to this ICSID Tribunal to claim costs. In taking these contrary positions, the Netherlands' application for costs fails on the basis of the Netherlands' failure to adhere to the international law maxim *allegans contraria non-est audiendus* (\"a person adducing to the contrary may not be heard\", or as paraphrased by Lord McNair, a party \"cannot blow hot and cold.\" [Lord McNair, The Law of Treaties 485, 485 (1961)].\n\n64.\n\nOn this ground alone, even assuming that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to order costs, the Tribunal has determined to deny the Netherlands' request for costs.\n\n65.\n\nTo be clear, the Tribunal accepts that there are situations in which a tribunal may order costs of proceedings that have resulted in a finding that the tribunal has no jurisdiction. But in the Tribunal's view, the circumstances of this case are clearly distinguishable.\n\n66.\n\nFurther, in coming to this determination, the Tribunal need not accept RWE's argument that the Netherlands breached the ICSID Convention and therefore cannot benefit from its own wrong in obtaining costs. This is not a question of bad faith on the part of the Netherlands, but of holding parties in international arbitration to the consequences of their legal positions.\n\n67.\n\nAlthough it is not strictly necessary, the Tribunal will address the substance of the Netherlands' request for costs. In specific, even if the Tribunal were inclined to allocate reasonable costs to the Netherlands, there simply is no objective or fair way to do so on the basis of the evidence provided.\n\n68.\n\nThe information in the [REDACTED] Affidavit is, at best, skeletal \u2013 a short bullet-point list of \"research, meetings, drafting and correspondence\" reportedly undertaken by counsel at different stages of the arbitration, with no details as to the lawyers involved, the experts retained, the time invested, the billing rates, the actual invoices submitted, or the payments made on invoices. Although [REDACTED] states that she reviewed the invoices of two law firms \u2013 Foley Hoag LLP and De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek \u2013 only the latter firm is referenced in the table setting out the total of more than EUR [REDACTED] in legal fees. The footnote to the table states that the total includes an estimated [REDACTED] attributable to the first instance German court proceedings.\n\n69.\n\nFurthermore, although the Tribunal did expressly reserve costs issues in its decisions denying RWE's applications for bifurcation and provisional measures \u2013 and assuming the Tribunal were to have authority to estimate and allocate such costs in this discontinuance order \u2013 the Tribunal would not consider it fair to take a black-and-white view as to which Party prevailed in those applications. As for the bifurcation application, although the Claimants failed in their attempt to force the Respondent to file an *Achmea/Komstroy* preliminary objection at an early stage, it cannot fairly be said that the Claimants were unreasonable in seeking to save time and costs by seeking to bifurcate the very objection that ultimately led to termination of this arbitration \u2013 and RWE should not be punished with a costs assessment for having done so. As for the provisional measures application, it bears recalling that the Tribunal went to some effort in the order denying the application to memorialize the Netherlands' public statements that the German court proceedings were not intended to interfere with the Tribunal's jurisdiction \u2013 although that is ultimately what happened. The inequitable nature of the Netherlands' claim for some EUR [REDACTED] in costs is underscored by [REDACTED] disclosure that the Netherlands incurred almost one-third of those costs in the German court proceedings aimed at defeating this Tribunal's jurisdiction, and another significant portion in resisting the Tribunal's consideration of the *Achmea/Komstroy* objection as a threshold issue.\n\n70.\n\nIn light of the decision not to order costs in the Netherlands' favor, the Tribunal need not examine in detail the Parties' mutual accusations of bad faith and wasted procedural steps, or the related issue of whether such conduct \u2013 as in *RSM v. Grenada* \u2013 constitutes exceptional circumstances warranting an allocation of costs with the discontinuance order. At a high level, the Tribunal observes that neither side behaved in a manner evincing bad faith and, indeed, both sides pursued their arbitration strategies with relatively equal determination. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers it equitable that the Claimants and the Respondent each bear their own costs of this arbitration.\n\n71.\n\nAs a final point, the Tribunal acknowledges that, in the footnote to the [REDACTED] Affidavit, [REDACTED] states that \"[a] detailed accounting can be provided upon the Tribunal's request.\" The Tribunal sees no basis for requesting a further detailed accounting, having invited the Respondent in its letter of 24 October 2023 to submit its costs submissions and the Netherlands having chosen to do so in skeletal fashion. Fairness does not require the Tribunal to give the Netherlands an additional opportunity to rectify evidentiary shortcomings in its costs submissions. In related vein, as the Tribunal has determined not to allocate costs, there is no basis for RWE to exercise its asserted right to submit its own request for costs.\n\n**IV.
