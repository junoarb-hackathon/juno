THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n**A. The Claimant**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nTeco Guatemala Holdings LLC, the claimant in this arbitration **(\"Teco\"** or **\"the Claimant\"),** is a limited liability company established in 2005 under the laws of the state of Delaware in the United States of America.\n\n2.\n\nTeco is a subsidiary entirely owned by *TECO Energy Inc.* **(\"TECO ENERGY\"),** a parent company established under the laws of the state of Florida, United States of America.\n\n3.\n\nIn 1998, another subsidiary of the group TECO ENERGY established in the Cayman Islands and known as Teco Power Service Corporation de Ultramar Guatemala, S.A. **(\"TPS\"),** together with Iberdrola Energia S.A. **(\"Iberdrola\")** and Electricidade de Portugal S.A. **(\"EDP\"),** formed the Guatemalan company Distribuci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Centro-Americana S.A. **(\"DECA I\"),** and through the latter company, acquired 80 percent of the capital of Empresa El\u00e9ctrica de Guatemala S.A. **(\"EEGSA\").**\n\n4.\n\nEEGSA is a Guatemalan electricity company. Under Ministerial Agreement No. OM-158-98 of April 2, 1998 and the Authorization Agreement of May 15, 1998, the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Guatemala **(\"MEM\")** authorized EEGSA to distribute electricity in the departments of Guatemala, Sacatep\u00e9quez, and Escuintla for a period of 50 years. Following the privatization of EEGSA, under Ministerial Agreement No. OM-32-99 of January 11, 1999 and an Authorization Agreement of February 2, 1999, MEM also authorized EEGSA to distribute electricity in the departments of Chimaltenango, Santa Rosa and Jalapa for a period of 50 years.\n\n5.\n\nIn August 1999, DECA I was absorbed by EEGSA and another Guatemalan company known as Distribuci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Centro-Americana 2 S.A. **(\"DECA II\")** was created, which became the owner of 80 percent of the capital of EEGSA.\n\n6.\n\nTPS owned 30 percent of the capital of DECA II and the remaining capital of that company was owned by Iberdrola (49 percent) and by EDP (21 percent).\n\n7.\n\nIn 2004, the shares of TPS in DECA II were transferred within the group TECO ENERGY to another subsidiary known as TWG Non-Merchant Inc., which later changed its name to TECO Guatemala Inc. In 2005, the shares of DECA II owned by TECO Guatemala Inc. were transferred to the Claimant.\n\n8.\n\nIn 2010, DEC A II sold its shares in EEGSA to the Colombian firm Empresas P\u00fablicas de Medellin E.S.P. **(\"EPM\").**\n\n9.\n\nIn this procedure, Teco is represented by:\n\nAndrea J.

CONSENT TO ARBITRATION**\n------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe consent of the Republic of Guatemala to arbitration is established in Article 10.17.1 of the Free Trade Agreement between the Dominican Republic, the United States of America and Central America **(\"CAFTA-DR\"),** which provides that:\n\n*\"Each Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Section in Accordance with this Agreement.\"*\n\n13.\n\nParagraphs 2 and 3 of Article 10.16 of CAFTA-DR, entitled \"Submission of a Claim to Arbitration,\" provides that:\n\n\"2. *At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this Section, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration (\u2018notice of intent) [...].*\n\n*3. Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim, a claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph 1:*\n\n*(a) under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the respondent and the Party of the claimant are parties to the ICSID Convention [...]\"*\n\n14.\n\nArticle 10.18 of CAFTA-DR provides that:\n\n*\"Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party*\n\n*1. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)), or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage.*\n\n*2. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless:*\n\n*(a) the claimant consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and*\n\n*(b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,*\n\n*(i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant \u2019s written waiver, and*\n\n*(ii) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), by the claimant \u2019s and the enterprise \u2019s written waivers of any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.*\n\n*3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2(b), the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) and the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim injunctive relief and does not involve the payment of monetary damages before a judicial or administrative tribunal of the respondent, provided that the action is brought for the sole purpose of preserving the claimant \u2019s or the enterprise \u2019s rights and interests during the pendency of the arbitration.\"*\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant expressly consented to arbitration by submitting its request for arbitration **(\"Request for Arbitration\")** dated October 20, 2010 and satisfied all requirements provided by the CAFTA-DR for the commencement of the arbitration.1\n\nExhibit 3 to the Request for Arbitration.\n\n16.\n\nIn Accordance with Article 10.18.2(b) of CAFTA-DR, Teco also waived its right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any of the Parties any proceeding seeking compensation for any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16 of CAFTA-DR.2\n\nExhibit 4 to the Request for Arbitration.\n\n17.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Claimant met the requirement of notice of intent, that more than six months elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim, and that the requirement of written consent by the Parties to arbitration was met.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n18.\n\nOn January 13, 2009, the Claimant submitted its letter of intent to Guatemala, in accordance with Article 10.16.2 of CAFTA-DR.\n\n19.\n\nOn October 20, 2010, the Claimant submitted its Request for Arbitration to the ICSID Secretariat, in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n20.\n\nOn November 23, 2010, the Secretary-General registered the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration.\n\n21.\n\nOn February 11, 2011, the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted, consisting of Professor William W. Park, appointed by the Claimant, Professor Rodrigo Oreamuno, appointed by the Respondent, and Mr. Alexis Mourre, appointed jointly by the Parties to be the President of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n22.\n\nOn March 30, 2011, following a request for disqualification lodged by the Claimant, Professor Oreamuno declined to serve on the Arbitral Tribunal. On same date, the Secretary General of the ICSID notified the Parties, in accordance with rule 10(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the **\"Rules\"****),** that the proceeding would remain suspended in accordance with rule 10(2).\n\n23.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, the Respondent appointed Dr. Claus von Wobeser as arbitrator and the Claimant raised no objection to such appointment. Accordingly, on April 21, 2011 the Arbitral Tribunal was reconstituted with the following members: Professor William W. Park, Dr. Claus von Wobeser, and Mr. Alexis Mourre.\n\n24.\n\nOn May 23, 2011, in accordance with rule 13(1), the Tribunal held its first session with the Parties by conference call. The session was recorded and the Arbitral Tribunal established minutes **(\"Minutes of the First Session\")** which were transmitted to the Parties on June 14, 2011.\n\n25.\n\nThe Minutes of the First Session recorded the Parties\u2019 agreement on the rules applicable to the arbitration and the provisional timetable. The Minutes of the First session also recorded that the Parties agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal had been properly constituted and that they had no objections to the appointment of its members.\n\n26.\n\nOn September 23, 2011, the Claimant submitted its Memorial (the **\"Memorial\")** together with factual exhibits **C-l** to **C-418,** legal exhibits **CL-1** to **CL-56,** the witness statements of Carlos Manuel Bastos **(CWS-1),** Sandra W. Callahan **(CWS-2),** Miguel Francisco Calleja Mediano **(CWS-3),** Leonardo Giacchino **(CWS-4),** Gordon L. Gillette **(CWS-5)** and Luis Mat\u00e9 **(CWS-6),** as well as the expert reports of Rodolfo Alegr\u00eda Toru\u00f1o **(CER-1)** and Brent C. Kaczmarek **(CER-2).**\n\n27.\n\nOn October 25, 2011, the Respondent confirmed that it would object to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, but that it considered that it would be more effective for such objections to be considered at the same time as the merits. The Respondent therefore proposed the following schedule of proceedings, which was accepted by the Claimant and adopted by the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n\"*1. Respondent\u2019s memorial on jurisdiction and counter-memorial on the merits to be submitted on*  *January 24, 2012.*\n\n*2.*  *Claimant\u2019s counter-memorial on jurisdiction and reply on the merits to be submitted on*  *May 24, 2012.*\n\n*3. Respondent\u2019s rejoinder on the merits and jurisdiction to be submitted on* *September 24, 2012.\"3*\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter to the Arbitral Tribunal of October 25, 2011.\n\n28.\n\nOn December 16, 2011, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, dealing with certain requests for the production of documents made by the Respondent.\n\n29.\n\nOn January 24, 2012, the Respondent filed its memorial on jurisdiction and admissibility and counter-memorial on the merits (the **\"Counter-Memorial\"),** together with factual exhibits **R-l** to **R-162,** legal exhibits **RL-1** to **RL-17,** the witness statements of Carlos Eduardo Col\u00f3m Bickford **(RWS-1),** Enrique Moller Hern\u00e1ndez **(RWS-2),** Alejandro Alberto Amau Sarmiento, Mariana \u00c1lvarez Guerrero and Edgardo Leandro Torres (Mercados Energ\u00e9ticos) **(RWS-3),** as well as the expert reports of Manuel A. Abdala and Marcelo A. Schoeters **(RER-1),** Mario C. Damonte **(RER-2)** and Juan Luis Aguilar Salguero **(RER-3).**\n\n30.\n\nOn January 31, 2012, the Claimant requested the Arbitral Tribunal to exclude exhibits R-102, R-140, R-149, R-150, and R-151 and requested that the Respondent resubmit its Counter-Memorial after removing the references to such exhibits.\n\n31.\n\nOn February 2, 2012, the Claimant requested that paragraph 10.3 of the Minutes of the First Session be amended. On February 3, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal asked the Parties to try to reach an agreement on the matter.\n\n32.\n\nOn February 9, 2012, the Parties agreed to amend the third paragraph of item 10 of the Minutes of the First Session concerning the obligation to translate documents by replacing *\"including ICSID decisions\"* with *\"apart from ICSID or other international legal decisions.\"*\n\n33.\n\nOn February 10, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued its order on Claimant\u2019s January 31, 2012 request to exclude documents. The Arbitral Tribunal refused to exclude exhibits R-102, R-149, R-150 and R-151 from the record for such exhibits related to individuals who had submitted witness statements in the arbitration. Regarding exhibit R-140, the Arbitral Tribunal removed it from the record but gave the Respondent the option of replacing it by a document consisting solely of extracts from the statement made by Mr. Bastos in the Iberdrola arbitration.\n\n34.\n\nOn March 21, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 2, dealing with Claimant\u2019s requests for the production of documents.\n\n35.\n\nOn March 28, 2012, the Claimant requested that the Arbitral Tribunal order the Respondent to produce a clean copy of document G3-25 produced by the Respondent in response to the Claimant\u2019s request to produce.\n\n36.\n\nOn March 30, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal directed the Parties to confer and attempt to agree on the question of the time-limit for the non-disputing parties\u2019 submissions.\n\n37.\n\nOn April 4, 2012, the Respondent informed the Arbitral Tribunal that it agreed to produce a clean copy of document G3-25, but that such production did not amount to a waiver of the privilege of communications between the CNEE and its internal or external legal counsels.\n\n38.\n\nOn April 9, 2012, the Parties agreed that the time-limit for the submission of nondisputing parties\u2019 briefs would be October 8, 2012.\n\n39.\n\nOn April 11, 2012, the Respondent confirmed that it had produced all the documents ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal in its Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n40.\n\nOn April 12, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal noted the Parties\u2019 agreement on the timelimit for the submissions of the non-disputing parties. The non-disputing parties were notified by the ICSID Secretary General of such time-limit on April 18, 2012.\n\n41.\n\nOn May 24, 2012, the Claimant filed its reply (the **\"Reply\"),** together with factual exhibits **C-419** to **C-594,** legal exhibits **CL-57** to **CL-80,** the additional witness statements of Carlos Manuel Bastos **(CWS-7),** Sandra W. Callahan **(CWS-8),** Miguel Francisco Calleja Mediano **(CWS-9),** Leonardo Giacchino **(CWS-10),** Gordon L. Guillette **(CWS-11)** and Luis Mat\u00e9 **(CWS-12)** and the additional expert reports by Rodolfo Alegr\u00eda Toru\u00f1o **(CER-3),** Fernando Barrera Rey and Carlos Fernando Barrientos **(CER-4)** and Brent C. Kaczmarek **(CER-5).**\n\n42.\n\nOn September 24, 2012, the Respondent filed its rejoinder (the **\"Rejoinder\"),** together with factual exhibits **R-l63** to **R-208,** legal exhibits **RL-18** to **RL-32,** the additional witness statements of Carlos Eduardo Colom Bickford **(RWS-4)** and Enrique Moller Hern\u00e1ndez **(RWS-5),** and expert reports by Manuel A. Abdala and Marcelo A. Schoeters **(RER-4),** Mario C. Damonte **(RER-5)** and Juan Luis Aguilar Salguero **(RER-6).**\n\n43.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, the Claimant complained that the Respondent had addressed jurisdictional issues in its Rejoinder, while it had been agreed in the Minutes of the First Session that the Rejoinder would only deal with the merits. The Claimant therefore requested an opportunity to answer such jurisdictional arguments.\n\n44.\n\nOn October 1, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal invited the Parties to *\"confer and agree on the organization and agenda of the hearings\"* and informed them that the Arbitral Tribunal would hold *\"a pre-hearing conference call on Tuesday 11 December, 2012.\"4*\n\nArbitral Tribunal message to the Parties of October 1, 2012.\n\n45.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent agreed that the Claimant would respond to its last jurisdictional arguments no later than November 9, 2012.\n\n46.\n\nOn October 5, 2012, the Governments of the Dominican Republic and the Republic of El Salvador submitted a non-disputing party brief pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of CAFTA-DR. On the same day, the Arbitral Tribunal granted an extension until November 23, 2012 of the time-limit for the other non-disputing parties to submit briefs.\n\n47.\n\nOn October 12, 2012, the Claimant requested that exhibits R-189, R-191, R-193, R-194, R-195, R-197, R-200 and R-202, as well as any reference to such exhibits in the Rejoinder or in other documents be excluded from the record.\n\n48.\n\nOn October 19, 2012, the Respondent objected to such request.\n\n49.\n\nOn October 235, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal decided to remove from the record exhibits R-189, R-191, R-193, R-194, R-195, R-197, R-200 and R-202, except for the parts of document R-202 relating to the evidence of Claimant\u2019s experts and witnesses whom the Respondent had decided to cross-examine. The Arbitral Tribunal also ordered the Respondent to remove any reference to such documents in its Rejoinder or other documents exhibited therewith.\n\nThe letter from the ICSID Secretariat was mistakenly dated October 15, 2012.\n\n50.\n\nOn November 2, 2012, the Parties submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal their proposals for the organization of the evidentiary hearings.\n\n51.\n\nOn November 6, 2012, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder without the references to the removed exhibits.\n\n52.\n\nOn November 8, 2012, the Claimant requested that the Arbitral Tribunal exclude witness statement RWS-3 and exhibit R-103 from the record since its authors would not be available for cross-examination at the evidentiary hearings.\n\n53.\n\nOn November 9, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal informed the Parties of its decisions concerning the organization of the evidentiary hearings.\n\n54.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant filed its rejoinder on jurisdiction and admissibility **(\"Rejoinder on Jurisdiction\").**\n\n55.\n\nOn November 15, 2012, the Republic of Honduras submitted a non-disputing party brief.\n\n56.\n\nOn November 19, 2012, the Respondent responded to Claimant\u2019s November 8, 2012 request for the exclusion of certain documents from the record.\n\n57.\n\nOn November 20, 2012, the Respondent submitted the third witness statement of Carlos Eduardo Colom Bickford **(RWS-6)** and exhibits R-209 to R-211.\n\n58.\n\nOn November 21, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal decided to exclude RWS-3 from the record6 and admitted exhibit R-103 as documentary evidence.\n\nIn accordance with the Minutes of the First Session, item 15, penultimate paragraph.\n\n59.\n\nOn November 23, 2012, the United States of America submitted a non-disputing party brief.\n\n60.\n\nOn November 30, 2012, the Parties submitted the following list of witnesses and experts to be cross-examined:\n\nWitnesses for the Claimant:\n\nGordon L. Gillette\n\nSandra W. Callahan\n\nMiguel Francisco\n\nCalleja Mediano\n\nLuis Mat\u00e9\n\nLeonardo Giacchino\n\nCarlos Manuel Bastos\n\nWitnesses for the Respondent:\n\nEnrique Moller Hern\u00e1ndez\n\nCarlos Eduardo Col\u00f3m Bickford\n\nExperts:\n\nRodolfo Alegr\u00eda Toru\u00f1o\n\nJuan Luis Aguilar Salguero\n\nFemando Barrera-Rey\n\nMario C.

The Arbitral Tribunal did not impose page limitations but invited the Parties *\"to make their best efforts to contain the volume of their briefs, which should not be duplicative of the Parties\u2019 existing memorials.\"7*\n\nMarch 22, 2013 Arbitral Tribunal letter to the Parties.\n\n70.\n\nIn the same communication, the Arbitral Tribunal also gave the Parties until July 5, 2013 to simultaneously submit their claims for costs and until July 19, 2013 to submit any rejoinders to the other party\u2019s claims for costs.\n\n71.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, each party submitted its post-hearing brief **(\"PHB\").** Claimant also submitted exhibits **C-626** to **C-629.**\n\n72.\n\nOn June 18, 2013, the Claimant requested the Arbitral Tribunal to exclude certain information related to the Iberdrola arbitration from Respondent\u2019s PHB. On June 26, 2013, the Respondent objected to such request\n\n73.\n\nOn June 25, 2013, the Parties requested the Arbitral Tribunal to modify the schedule for the remaining filings as follows: Reply PHB on July 8, 2013; submissions on costs on July 24, 2013, and reply submissions on costs on August 7, 2013. The same date, the Arbitral Tribunal accepted the Parties\u2019 request.\n\n74.\n\nOn June 27, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal decided that paragraphs 10, 152 and 155 as well as footnote 18 of Respondent\u2019s PHB would be disregarded. However, for practical purposes, the Arbitral Tribunal did not request that the Respondent resubmit its PHB. The Arbitral Tribunal also reminded the Parties *\"that it will resolve this case on the basis of the direct oral and written evidence produced in this case, and that no consideration will be given to either the parties pleadings or the transcripts in the Iberdrola arbitration, save of course to the limited extent identified in the Tribunal\u2019s letters of 10 February and 15 October 2012.\"*\n\n75.\n\nOn July 8, 2013, each party submitted its second PHB.\n\n76.\n\nOn July 24, 2013 the Parties simultaneously submitted their claims for expenses and arbitration costs.\n\n77.\n\nOn August 7, 2013, the Parties simultaneously submitted their replies on costs. The Respondent submitted an updated claim for expenses on November 18, 2013, to take into account the payment of the third advance of fees and costs requested by ICSID in its letter of 7 August 2013.\n\n78.\n\nOn November 12, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal declared the proceeding closed in accordance with Article 38 of the Rules.\n\n**IV. SUMMARY OF THE FACTS**\n----------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThis dispute arose from the alleged violation by the *Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica* (National Commission of Electric Energy) **(\"CNEE\")** of the Guatemalan regulatory framework for setting tariffs for distribution of energy by EEGSA, the electricity company in which the Claimant had an indirect share.\n\n**A. Background of the electricity distribution system in Guatemala**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s, Guatemala\u2019s public electricity sector was facing a series of difficulties due to insufficient generating capacity.8\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a711 *et seq* ***.',*** Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7138 ***et seq***\n\n81.\n\nAt that time, electricity generation in Guatemala was controlled by the *Instituto Nacional de Electrificaci\u00f3n* **(\"INDE\"),** a State-owned body established by decree in 1959 to plan, design, construct, and finance works and facilities and to meet the electricity needs of the nation,9 while distribution was the responsibility of the *Empresa El\u00e9ctrica de Guatemala S.A.* **(\"EEGSA\"),10***Distribuidora El\u00e9ctrica de Occidente S.A.* **(\"DEOCSA\"),** and *Distribuidora El\u00e9ctrica de Oriente* **(\"DEORSA\"),11** all public corporations. EEGSA, although originally a private electricity-generating company, became in 1977 part of the government electricity system under the control of the Ministry of Energy and Mines **(\"MEM\").12** In 1983, MEM transferred its share in EEGSA to INDE.13\n\nExhibits R-l, C-19, and C-323.\n\nAt the time, EEGSA mainly provided distribution services in the central region of Guatemala, the departments of Guatemala, Sacatep\u00e9quez, and Escuintla, which accounted for 80 percent of the country\u2019s electricity consumption.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 41; Statement RWS-1, \u00a7 31.\n\nReport CER-1, \u00a7 8. Upon the expiration of the concession granted in 1922, 91.7 percent of EEGSA shares were acquired by the Government of Guatemala.\n\nMemorial, footnote 13, Report CER-1.\n\n82.\n\nThe difficulties facing the sector were due, on the one hand, to the fact that INDE played a dual role of regulator and operator with little or no incentive to operate efficiently and, on the other, to external factors such as unfavorable climate conditions, the oil crisis of the 1970s, the depreciation of the Guatemalan currency, and the country\u2019s debt crisis, which made it difficult for INDE to invest the necessary funds.14\n\nReport CER-1, Exhibit C-l9.\n\n83.\n\nBecause of this situation, Guatemala considered the possibility of privatizing certain activities in the sector and in 1990 the President of Guatemala, Jorge Serrano, commissioned through the United States Agency for International Development **(\"USAID\")** a study of possible options for the privatization of EEGSA.15 On January 11, 1991, Guatemala received a report that had been prepared by Price Waterhouse between September and November 1990 (the **\"PW Report\").16**\n\nReport CER-2, \u00a7 28.\n\nExhibit ***C-l.***\n\n84.\n\nThe PW Report concluded that the time was not yet ripe for privatization of EEGSA, for four main reasons:\n\n*\u2022 \"Basic subsidy problem is not addressed - Subsidy problems in the power sector, although large, do not seem critical enough to rush a sale of EEGSA. This is particularly true because EEGSA is a relatively efficient operator compared to INDE, and privatizing EEGSA does not address the basic subsidy problem that would still be present in INDE\u2019s electricity rates.*\n\n*\u2022 Regulatory mechanisms are not established. - The lack of appropriate regulatory mechanisms could lead to monopoly pricing and sharp tariff increases if EEGSA were privatized at the present time.*\n\n*\u2022 Expected revenue from sale of EEGSA is low - the current economic situation, with high inflation, high interest rates, and exchange rate problems makes it a poor time to privatize due to the very low values that EEGSA is likely to command under such conditions. The limited interest of foreign investors and the lack of a local equity market are also issues that reduce the value of EEGSA to investors.*\n\n*\u2022 EEGSA and INDE are currently too interdependent - EEGSA\u2019s close relationship and interdependency with INDE would have to be restructured to eliminate most subsidies and to establish power purchase contracts before any privatization. Further analysis would be required to examine the future of the entire Guatemalan electricity system, including INDE and the other electric distribution companies.\"17*\n\nExhibit C-7, Executive Summary.\n\n85.\n\nThe PW Report also estimated the book value of EEGSA\u2019s shares at the time at US$59.6 million, and its value based on expected cash flows at approximately US$13.9 million.18\n\nExhibit C-7,p. 26.\n\n86.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1993, Guatemala increased its electricity tariffs in order to reduce the need for State subsidies19 and in 1992 it started to reorganize INDE and to reduce its role in electricity generation, allowing private players to become involved in electricity generation.20\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 18; Exhibit C-10.\n\nReport CER-2, \u00a7 30; Exhibit C-61.\n\n87.\n\nIn 1993, the Government of Guatemala, through USAID, commissioned the Chilean firm Synex Ingenieros Consultores Ltda. **(\"Synex\")** to prepare a report describing the legal and regulatory framework needed to attain the goals of de-monopolizing and decentralizing the electricity sector in Guatemala and opening it to private participation.\n\n88.\n\nSynex submitted its report **(\"Synex Report\")** in June 1993.\n\n89.\n\nThe authors of the report, Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Bernstein and Jean Jacques Descazeaux, mentioned *\"the need to have clear rules of the game for the operation and development of the sector [...], particularly as regards generating, transmitting, and distributing companies,* [which] *implies defining the rights, obligations and limitations of the actors participating in the industry, including the government itself.* *The need for a general body of laws regulating the functioning of the electric sector seems to be an absolute need, even more so if the declared objectives are the disappearance of the directing and normative role of INDE, the entrepreneurial decentralization of the sector, and the free access of investors to production, transport and distribution of electricity. Experience shows that, paradoxically, the functioning of decentralized and competitive schemes requires precise definitions of each party\u2019s obligations and rights if chaotic conditions are to be avoided in the industry\u2019s operation and development.*  \n*The existing Guatemalan legislation is [... ] absolutely insufficient: it will obstruct the participation of private external investors in competitive generation and distribution.\"21*\n\nSynex Report, p. 33 (Exhibit C-9).\n\n90.\n\nIn addition, since there was an apparent consensus among industry players that the regulatory bodies in the electricity industry were not functioning properly, Guatemala needed *\"objective rules that define the parties\u2019 obligations and rights, thus preventing the arbitrary intervention of regulatory entities\"22* The authors stated that *\"it would be possible to minimize the intervention of a regulatory organism in those matters most sensitive to regulation, such as price regulation in the segments with characteristics of a natural monopoly: transmission and distribution\"* and suggested for that purpose *\"a specific intervention [...] every five or 10 years, by a high-level ad-hoc Government entity, for example a Committee formed by the Ministers of Finance and of Energy and Mines to supervise a tariff outside study commissioned by the concession holders from a prestigious consulting agency. The permanent regulatory function would be limited to overseeing compliance with the law in matters such as safety of facilities [...], even if the arbitration of conflicting aspects might be given to arbitrating courts appointed by the parties''23*\n\n***Ibid.,*** p. 34.\n\n***Ibid.***\n\n91.\n\nOn December 7, 1994, the Congress of the Republic of Guatemala adopted Decree 64-94, repealing the Law establishing INDE and approving changes designed to demonopolize electricity generation and partially deregulate the electricity sector.24 Article 50 of the Organic Law on INDE specified that a comprehensive proposal for the reform of the sector would be submitted to Congress within six months.\n\nExhibit C-397.\n\n92.\n\nMessrs. Bernstein and Descazeaux then drafted the new General Electricity Law and Regulations (the **\"Draft LGE\"),** the final version of which was submitted on April 4, 1995.25\n\nExhibit C-13.\n\n93.\n\nIn their preamble to the Draft LGE, the authors stated that the text must *\"adhere to the objectives of de-concentration and de-monopolization defined by the Government and by a large number of social and political classes of the country, and create the conditions to attract private investment in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity\"* and stated that, in developing the project, special emphasis had been placed on *\"the need to establish transparent and objective regulations for those activities with the characteristics of a natural monopoly, such as transmission and distribution\"26*\n\n***Ibid.,*** English translation provided by the Claimant.\n\n94.\n\nOn September 19, 1996, the Congressional Commission on Energy and Mines issued a report recommending that Congress should adopt the Draft LGE. In its report, the Commission indicated that the objectives of the LGE were *\"the establishment of a legal framework of general application that provides legal certainty to public and private investment in the subsector, as a basic condition for the securing of financing from international credit entities and from national capitals, which seek to invest in conditions of equality and competitiveness, so as to be able to ensure maximum benefits of quality and price for electricity services to users and the urgency of taking the service to the majority of the population\u2014approximately 70 percent\u2014that today lacks such service...\"* It also included as the objectives of the LGE *\"the de-monopolization and de-politicization of the activities of the subsector, by creating entities and authorities that regulate and avoid the political interference that has caused, and can cause, so much distortion and damage, unless clear legal provisions of general application are established, which is precisely the intent of this law, seeking, above all, the common good\"27*\n\nExhibit C-15, English translation provided by the Claimant.\n\n**B. The new regulatory framework**\n-----------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nOn October 16, 1996, by Decree 93-96, the Congress of Guatemala adopted the General Electricity Law **(\"LGE\"),** which entered into force on November 15, 1996.28\n\nExhibit C-17.\n\n1. The General Electricity Law\n------------------------------\n\n**a) Creation of the CNEE**\n---------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe LGE created the **CNEE,** a technical organ with its own functions and budget for the discharge of its responsibilities and duties.29 The CNEE would be composed of three members appointed by the Executive Branch every five years, one from each of three slates proposed by the rectors of universities in Guatemala, the MEM, and wholesale agents.30\n\nLGE, art. 4; RLGE, art. 29.\n\nLGE, art. 5.\n\n97.\n\nThe functions of the CNEE, as established in the LGE, are as follows:\n\n*\"a) Complying with and enforcing this law and its regulations on matters within its scope of responsibility and imposing penalties on violators.*\n\n*b) Watching over and ensuring performance of the obligations of the awardees and holders of concessions, protecting the rights of users and preventing conduct that is against free competition, as well as abusive or discriminatory practices.*\n\n*c) Defining the transmission and distribution rates subject to regulation in accordance with this law, as well as the methodology for calculation of the same.*\n\n*d) Settling disputes that arise among agents of the electrical subsector, acting as arbitrator among the parties when the latter do not reach agreement.*\n\n*e) Issuing technical regulations relative to the electrical subsector and overseeing compliance with them consistent with accepted international practices.*\n\n*f) Issuing provisions and regulations to ensure free access to and use of the transmission lines and distribution networks in accordance with the provisions of this Law and its regulations.''*31\n\nLGE, art. 4, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17).\n\n**b) Basis for calculating the tariffs**\n----------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nSection IV of the LGE concerns price regulation and Chapter III of that Section deals with the tariffs applicable to end consumers for final distribution.\n\n99.\n\nArticle 71 of the LGE provides that:\n\n*\"The rates to end consumers for the final distribution service, in their components of power and energy, shall be calculated by* [the CNEE] *as the sum of the weighted price of all the distributor purchases referenced to the inlet to the distribution network and the Value Added of Distribution (Valor Agregado de Distribuci\u00f3n - VAD) [...].*  \n*The VAD is the average cost of capital and operation of a distribution network of a benchmark-efficient company operating in a given density area.\"32*\n\nLGE, art. 71, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17).\n\n100.\n\nArticle 71 of the LGE follows the \"model enterprise\" system, whereby VAD does not reimburse the distributor for its real costs but pays it on the basis of the costs that a hypothetical efficient company would have incurred.33\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 32; Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 146.\n\n101.\n\nAccording to Article 72 of the LGE, the VAD *\"shall take into account at least the following basic components:*\n\n*a) Costs associated with the user, regardless of its demandfor power and energy.*\n\n*b) Average distribution losses, broken down into their power and energy components.*\n\n*c) Costs of capital, operation, and maintenance associated with distribution, stated by unit of power supplied.\"*\n\n102.\n\nArticle 73 provides that *\"the cost of capital per unit of power shall be calculated as the constant annuity of cost of capital corresponding to the New Replacement Value* **(\"NRV\"** or in Spanish original: *Valor Nuevo de Reemplazo* **\"VNR\")** *of an economically sized distribution network. The annuity will be calculated with the typical useful life for distribution facilities and the discount rate that is used in calculation of the rates. The operation and maintenance cost will be that corresponding to efficient management of the benchmark distribution network. \"*\n\n103.\n\nIn this connection, Article 67 of the LGE provides that *\"the investment annuity shall be calculated based on the New Replacement Value of the optimally designed facilities, using the discount rate that is used in the calculation of the rates and a useful life of thirty (30) years. The New Replacement Value is the cost involved in building the works and physical assets of the authorization with the technology available on the market to provide the same service. The concept of economically* *adapted installation involves recognizing in the New Replacement Value only those* *facilities or parts of facilities that are economically justified to provide the required*  *service.*\"34\n\nLGE, art. 67, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17).\n\n104.\n\nArticle 76 of the LGE specifies that the *\"rates shall strictly reflect the economic cost of acquiring and distributing the electric energy. \"35*\n\nLGE, art. 76, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17).\n\n105.\n\nArticle 79 refers to the applicable discount rate and states: *\"the discount rate to be used in this Law to determine the rates shall be equal to the rate of cost of capital determined by* [the CNEE] *through studies commissioned with private entities that specialize in the matter, and it must reflect the rate of cost of capital for activities of similar risk in the country. Cost of capital rates different from those for the activities of transmission and distribution may be used. In any event, if the discount rate should be less than an annual real rate of seven percent or greater than an annual real rate of thirteen percent, the latter values, respectively, will be used''*\n\n**c) Procedure for calculating the tariffs**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nRegarding the procedure for calculating tariffs, the regulatory framework establishes that the VAD used to calculate tariffs will be determined on the basis of a study conducted by a consultant commissioned by each distributor.\n\n107.\n\nFor this purpose, Article 74 of the LGE provides that *\"each distributor shall calculate the VAD components through a study entrusted to an engineering firm prequalified by the Commission* [the CNEE].\"\n\n108.\n\nThese engineering firms were to work under terms of reference drawn up by the CNEE, which would have the right to monitor the progress of such studies.36\n\nRLGE, art. 97.\n\n109.\n\nOnce completed, the VAD studies would be reviewed by the CNEE, which would be able to comment on them.37\n\nRLGE, art. 98.\n\n110.\n\nIn case of written objections, Article 75 of the LGE provides that \"[the CNEE] *and the distributors shall agree on the appointment of an expert commission* (the **\"Expert Commission\")** *made of three members, one appointed by each party and the third by mutual agreement ''* In this case, *\"The Expert Commission shall* *pronounce itself on the differences in a period of 60 days counted from its appointment \"38*\n\nLGE, art. 75, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17).\n\n111.\n\nThe LGE specifies that the time-limits for the preparation of such studies, the review, submission of comments and the appointment of the Expert Commission, would be set in the Regulation.39\n\nLGE, art. 77.\n\n112.\n\nArticle 77 of the LGE states that *\"the methodology for determination of the rates shall be reviewed by* [the CNEE] *every five (5) years during the first half of January of the year in question\"*\n\n2. The RLGE\n-----------\n\n113.\n\nOn March 21, 1997, pursuant to the transitory provisions of the LGE, the President of Guatemala and the MEM issued Government Resolution No. 256-97 containing the LGE Regulation (the **\"RLGE\").40** The RLGE was amended successively in 2003,41 2007,42 and 2008.43\n\nExhibit C-21.\n\nExhibit R-30.\n\nExhibit C-105.\n\nExhibit C-212.\n\n114.\n\nThe RLGE, in particular, establishes the parameters for the establishment by the CNEE of the terms of reference for the studies that distributors were to commission to consulting firms,44 as well as the deadlines for performing the necessary actions in the tariff review process.\n\nRLGE 1998, arts. 86-92, 97.\n\n115.\n\nRegarding the time-limits, the RLGE specifies that the CNEE would deliver the terms of reference to each distributor every five years, eleven months before the initial effective date of the tariffs.45\n\nRLGE 1998, art. 98. The original time-limit of 11 months was extended to 12 months by the 2007 amendment to the RLGE (Exhibit C-105).\n\n116.\n\nOnce the terms of reference had been provided, each distributor would have three months to submit its tariff study to the CNEE. The study would include the resulting tariff schedules, the adjustment formulas and a backup report.46\n\n***Ibid.*** The original time-limit of three months was extended to four months by the 2007 amendment to the RLGE (Exhibit C-105).\n\n117.\n\nThereafter, the CNEE would have one month to approve or reject the studies submitted by distributors, *\"making the observations it deems pertinent\"47.*\n\n***Ibid.*** The original time-limit of one month was extended to two months by the 2007 amendment to the RLGE (Exhibit C-105).\n\n118.\n\nOnce the CNEE had submitted observations, the RLGE provides that:\n\n*\"The Distributor, through the consultant company, shall analyze the observations, perform the corrections to the studies, and shall deliver them to* [the CNEE] *within the term of fifteen days after receiving the observations. If discrepancies between* [the CNEE] *and the Distributor persist, the procedure stipulated in Article 75 of the Law shall be followed.\"48*\n\n***Ibid.,*** English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-21).\n\n119.\n\nAs noted above, Article 75 of the LGE provides that, in such a case:\n\n\"[The CNEE] *and the distributors shall agree on the appointment of an Expert Commission made of three members, one appointed by each party and the third by mutual agreement \"* and the Expert Commission *\"shall rule on the differences in a period of 60 days counted from its appointment.''49*\n\nLGE, art. 75.\n\n120.\n\nThe last paragraph of Article 98 of the RLGE established that:\n\n*\"So long as the Distributor does not deliver the tariff studies or does not perform the corrections to same, according to what is stipulated in the previous paragraphs, it may not modify its tariffs and the tariffs in effect at the time of the termination of the effective term of such tariffs shall continue to apply.''50*\n\nRLGE 1998, art. 98. English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-21).\n\n121.\n\nHowever, Article 98 of the RLGE was amended in 2007. On March 2, 2007, the MEM issued Government Resolution No. 68-2007. Article 98 of the RLGE, as amended by that Government Resolution, reads as follows:\n\n*\"In case of the Distributor\u2019s failure to deliver the studies or the corrections to same, the Commission shall be empowered to issue and publish the corresponding tariff schedule, based on the tariff study the Commission performs independently or performing the corrections to the studies begun by the distributor.\"51*\n\nRLGE as amended in 2007, art. 98, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-104).\n\n122.\n\nIn 2003, the second paragraph of Article 99 of the RLGE was also amended. Article 99 in its 1998 version provided that:\n\n*\"Once the tariff study referred to in the previous Articles has been approved,* [the CNEE] *shall set the definitive tariff studies* [sic] *within a term not greater than one month as of the date on which the definitive study was approved, and shall publish them no later than April 30, in the Official Gazette. If* [the CNEE] *has not* *published the new tariffs, same may be adjusted by the distributors based on the effective adjustment formulas, save for what is set forth in the last paragraph of the previous Article. The tariffs shall apply as of May 1, immediately following the date of approval by* [the CNEE].\"52\n\nExhibit C-21, English translation provided by the Claimant.\n\n123.\n\nIn its amended 2003 version, Article 99 provides that:\n\n*\"If the Commission has not published the new tariffs, the tariffs of the previous tariff schedule shall continue to be applied, with their adjustment formulas \\...}In no case shall the Final Distribution activity of the electric service be carried out without an effective tariff schedule. Given the circumstance in which a Distributor does not have a tariff schedule, the National Electric Energy Commission shall be responsible for immediately issuing and making effective a tariff schedule so as to comply with such stated principle.\"53*\n\nExhibit C-105, English translation provided by the Claimant.\n\n**C. The privatization of EEGSA**\n---------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nOn February 13, 1997, the Government of Guatemala announced its intention to privatize EEGSA and, on December 17 of that same year, President Alvaro Arzu issued Government Resolution No. 865-97, authorizing the privatization by public offering and national and international auction, in accordance with the Law on Government Procurement, of 96 percent of the EEGSA\u2019s share capital owned by the State.54\n\nExhibit C-23. The difference in the percentage of EEGSA shares owned by the State (91.7 percent in 1972 and 96.1 percent in 1997) is due to the fact that profits were ploughed back by EEGSA in 1995 (see footnote 12).\n\n125.\n\nAccording to Government Resolution No. 865-97, EEGSA was responsible for organizing the public offering55, for which purpose it established a High-Level Committee and enlisted the services of *Salomon Smith Barney Holdings Inc.* **(\"Salomon Smith Barney\")** as financial consultant.\n\nExhibit C-23, arts. 3-7.\n\n126.\n\nIn April 1998, Salomon Smith Barney prepared a preliminary information memorandum (the **\"Preliminary Memorandum\"),** which was sent to potential investors, including TECO ENERGY.56\n\nExhibit C-27.\n\n127.\n\nThe Preliminary Memorandum established the goal of selling all EEGSA\u2019s shares as follows: 80 percent would be offered to strategic investors by national and international public bidding and the remaining 16.1 percent owned by the State would be sold to \"priority investors\" (EEGSA employees, users, and the general public). The 3.9 percent of shares that Guatemala did not control and that belonged to private investors would remain under the control of those investors.\n\n128.\n\nThe Preliminary Memorandum referred to the regulatory framework as follows:\n\n*\"Pursuant to the provisions of the Law and the Regulations, tariffs for regulated customers [...] are set by adding (i) the average cost of energy purchased by the distribution company [...] and (ii) the* valor agregado de distribuci\u00f3n *(the Value Addedfor Distribution, or \u2018VAD).*  \n*Costs of energy purchased that are used to calculate tariffs for regulated consumers shall be calculated every five years and are based on a model efficient distribution company. [...] It is the duty* q/'[the CNEE] *to ensure that tariffs are set on a pass-through basis. \"57*\n\n***Ibid.,*** pp. 9-10.\n\n129.\n\nAfter describing the concept of VAD in the LGE and the RLGE, the Preliminary Memorandum notes that:\n\n*\"VADs must be calculated by distributors using a study commissioned from an engineering firm* [...]. [The CNEE] *will review those studies and may make observations, but in the event of discrepancy, a Commission of three experts will be convened to resolve the differences.''58*\n\n***Ibid.*** p. 64, Tribunal\u2019s translation.\n\n130.\n\nA few paragraphs later, the Memorandum states that EEGSA had in the past *\"subsidized the market, which seriously undermined the company\u2019s financial health. However, the new Law tackles this problem directly by allowing the companies (INDE and EEGSA) to set tariffs on the basis of market prices''59*\n\n***Ibid.,*** Tribunal\u2019s translation.\n\n131.\n\nIn May 1998, EEGSA opened a data room and issued the terms of reference for the public offering,60 as well as a memorandum of sale (the **\"Memorandum of Sale\")61** and a draft share sale contract.

At the meeting, Mr. P\u00e9rez gave a presentation on the possibility of increasing the VAD but reducing the tariff component of energy costs, so that the VAD increase would not affect tariffs. In the presentation, EEGSA proposed a VAD increase of 10 percent, rather than the increase of 100 percent that would result from its consultant\u2019s study as corrected on the basis of the CNEE comments.135 The CNEE did not respond to such proposal.136\n\nExhibit C-194; Statements CWS-6, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23 and CWS-3, \u00a7 29.\n\nStatements CWS-5, \u00a7 20 and CWS-3, \u00a7 31.\n\n188.\n\nEEGSA submitted the corrected Bates White study on May 5, 2008, in which the consultant accepted some observations made by the CNEE and incorporated the relevant amendments, but rejected others.137 On the same day, Mr. Giacchino of Bates White responded to the observations made by the CNEE on the March 31, 2008 study.138\n\nExhibit C-195.\n\nExhibit C-207.\n\n189.\n\nThe VNR resulting from the corrected May 5, 2008 study was US$1.3 billion.139\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 122.\n\n4.

The role of the National Electricity Commission of fixing the tariff schemes is a legitimate power granted by the General Electricity Law whereby it represents the State, and regulated in Sections 60, 61, 7.1 and 73 of the mentioned law, which must restrict any discretional excess, since it refers to verifiable concepts stating that those tariffs \u2018must be compatible with standard distribution costs of efficient companies, \u2019 structured \u2018to promote equal treatment of consumers and the sector\u2019s economic efficiency, \u2019 that \u2018the Distribution Added Value shall be related to the average capital and operations costs of a distribution network of an efficient company of reference, \u2019 and, likewise that the \u2018cost of operation and maintenance shall correspond to an efficient management of the reference distribution network. \u2019 It is estimated that tariffs fixed, when the report by the Expert Commission has not been accepted as valid to guide this policy, cannot be, within its discretion, harmful or unreasonably arbitrary, in view of the indicators of efficient operators as a reference, as the one conditioned in temporary Section 2 of the related Law, which made reference to the \u2018values used in other countries applying a similar methodology. \u2019 However, the rationality of the tariff schemes approved was not reported as damage or as evidence in this amparo action, and the only damage reported focused on the concept of legal due process, which was already analyzed (paragraph a) of section VI of the conclusions).\"201*\n\n***Ibid.,*** p. 18 ***et seq.,*** English translation provided by the Claimant.\n\n235.\n\nIn a second judgment, dated February 24, 2010, the Constitutional Court reversed the judgment of the eighth civil court of first instance and considered that the dissolution of the Expert Commission could not be damaging to EEGSA, since the Commission\u2019s report was not binding on the CNEE. The judgment reads as follows:\n\n*\"... it should be noted that Sections 75 and 77 of the General Electricity Law and the third paragraph of Section 98 and Section 98 bis of its Rules set forth the procedure to create the Expert Commission and the time frame for the Commission to meet and to issue an opinion on the matters submitted thereto: the discrepancies arising from the tariff study based on the terms of reference. In the case at hand, the Expert Commission was created in compliance with the relevant Law and its Rules and, within the statutory period, issued its opinion on the discrepancies found by the National Electricity Commission between the tariff study submitted by the petitioner and the terms of reference previously set by the* *respondent authority. It should be pointed out that the Law and its Rules\u2014the only Guatemalan legal rules applicable in the case\u2014empower the Expert Commission only to issue its opinion on the above-mentioned discrepancies. In submitting its opinion, the Expert Commission performed the duty imposed thereon by the Law and its Rules. Therefore, given that it had already fulfilled its legal purpose, that it was a temporary rather than a permanent commission empowered to issue an opinion enabling the competent authority to set the tariffs, and that it had to meet no other duty in the proceedings, the dissolution of the commission could by no means cause damage to the petitioner because the respondent authority merely followed the procedure established by the Law and its Rules.\"*  \n[...]  \n*As ruled on this issue by the Court [...], in relation to the nature of the experts\u2019 opinion discussed herein, it is worthy of note that Expertise understood as wisdom, practice, experience, or skill in a science and art, has traditionally been used as an aid to which authorities resort when they need to make a decision regarding a certain subject. An expert is an assistant who provides an opinion on the best decision, although, pursuant to common legislation and Guatemalan legal practice, it is understood that scientific and technical knowledge do not constitute a judgment, but rather elements to guide the decision to be made by the authorities. Therefore, the authority making the decision has no obligation to base such decision on the experts\u2019 opinions... \u2019 Additionally, in reference to the scope of opinions like this, this Court has held that: Regarding its scope, the opinion is not binding upon the body seeking the advice whenever books of authority classify it as optional\u2014advice that the Administration is not obliged to require\u2014or compulsory\u2014advice that is expressly necessary pursuant to the law\u2014unless the opinion is expressly binding, as required by law and as a basis for the administrative decision. \u2019[...]*  \n*Based on the above remarks, requiring the Expert Commission to solve the dispute between the petitioner and the respondent authority; granting it jurisdiction to issue a binding decision; and even empowering it to approve the tariff studies, as the Court held, would violate the well-developed legality principle of the Rule of Law and would infringe the principle of public office subject to the law, because the General Electricity Law [...] entitle[s] the* *National Electricity Commission, as the only responsible agency, to set distribution tariffs and to approve tariff studies [...], which constitutes a public duty that, in keeping with Section 154 of the Guatemalan Constitution, may not be delegated.*  \n [...]  \n*... in the Guatemalan legal system, the National Electricity Commission shall review the studies conducted by the distributor and, in the event of discrepancies, shall appoint an Expert Commission, which shall issue an opinion on the discrepancies within 60 days following its creation. The Rules provide that, if the Distributor fails to send the studies or corrections to those studies, the National Electricity Commission (governmental agency of public law) may issue and publish the related tariff scheme based on the tariff study prepared independently by the commission or making the necessary corrections to the studies prepared by the distributor. [...] In view of the above, the National Electricity Commission caused no damage to the petitioner when it dissolved the Expert Commission and when it followed the procedure to devise the tariff schemes, given that such task\u2014 a state duty, as has been pointed out\u2014is a lawful power granted by Sections 60, 61, 71 and 73 of the General Electricity Law.\"202*\n\nExhibit C-345, pp. 15-17, English translation provided by the Claimant.\n\n7.

POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Summary of Respondent\u2019s position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe Respondent contends that: **(1)** the case stated by the Claimant is nothing more than a regulatory disagreement on the interpretation of Guatemalan domestic law, the interpretation of which is not a matter for this Arbitral Tribunal but for the Guatemalan courts, which have already decided the issue. According to the Respondent **(2)** the Claimant cannot use an international mechanism to file an appeal against the decisions of the Supreme Court of Guatemala and could only have challenged those decisions under international law by presenting a denial of justice claim. This has not been done, however, and there has been no allegation by the Claimant in this regard. Finally, **(3)** the Respondent cites the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal in the Iberdrola case.\n\n1. Teco\u2019s claim is a mere regulatory disagreement\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nGuatemala contends that the Claimant\u2019s claim is essentially based on its disagreement with the way the Guatemalan regulator interpreted and applied the regulatory framework in the tariff review process for 2008-2013.206\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 38.\n\n240.\n\nAlthough the Claimant refers to the amendments to Article 98 RLGE in 2007 and 2008, such is not the basis for its claim. What Claimant submits is that such provision, as amended in 2007, was incorrectly applied by the CNEE. In addition, Teco never complained about the 2007 amendment before this arbitration, and such a claim would now be time-barred. With respect to the 2008 amendment, Claimant admits that it was not applied, and therefore could not have caused Teco any harm.207\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 59; Rejoinder, \u00a7 41.\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s claim is therefore limited to the CNEE\u2019s interpretation of the Guatemalan regulatory framework concerning the role of the Expert Commission and the regulator\u2019s power to approve the VAD and EEGSA\u2019s rate of return based on a tariff study prepared by its own consultant rather than by the distributor\u2019s consultant.208\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a755 and 78; Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a740 *et seq.*\n\n242.\n\nRespondent argues that such regulatory disagreements cannot give rise to claims under the Treaty because the CNEE has the right and duty to interpret the law and take positions on issues that are within its jurisdiction. The General Electricity Law (LGE) itself and its regulations provide that the CNEE is the party responsible for complying with and enforcing these laws,209 and in particular they provide that the CNEE has the responsibility to *\"define the transmission and distribution tariffs [...] as well as the methodology for calculation of the same\"* and to conduct the tariff review process.210\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 56.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 57; LGE arts. 4 (c), 61 and 71.\n\n243.\n\nEven if the regulator was mistaken in its interpretation of the regulatory framework, this cannot result in a violation of an international treaty, particularly when local courts have already decided on the matter.211\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 112.\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimant itself realized that their differences in respect to the regulatory framework should be brought before the courts of Guatemala. The Claimant and EEGSA challenged the April 2008 Terms of Reference before the Guatemalan courts and obtained a temporary protection measure. The Claimant also raised their differences regarding the procedure for fixing the tariffs before the courts of Guatemala, and in particular the interpretation of the role of the Expert Commission; these appeals were admitted and processed by the courts of Guatemala, but ultimately the Constitutional Court decided in favor of the CNEE.\n\n245.\n\nOn November 18, 2009, the Constitutional Court decided whether the ruling of the Expert Commission was binding, as well as on the disputed extent of the regulator\u2019s power to set the tariff based on its own consultant\u2019s VAD study. The Respondent summarizes as follows what is in its view the content of the court\u2019s decisions in this respect: *\"a) The CNEE is the only entity empowered to approve the tariffs and is not authorized to delegate this function; (b) The Expert Commission has the sole function of issuing a pronouncement on discrepancies between the VAD study submitted by the distributor and the Terms of Reference issued by the CNEE; (c) The regulatory framework does not establish any additional function for the Expert Commission after it has issued its pronouncement; (d) Because of the advisory nature of expert reports under Guatemalan law and the responsibility of the CNEE to approve the tariffs, the pronouncement of the Expert Commission cannot be binding; and (e) Finally, the Court affirmed the regulatory nature of the CNEE\u2019s function to* *approve the tariffs, which must reflect legal criteria, in particular the costs, including the cost of capital.\"212*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 125; Rejoinder, \u00a7 49 (b).\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that, in its decision of February 24, 2010, the Constitutional Court found that: *\"(a) the relevant legislation does not grant the Expert Commission any function other than to issue a pronouncement on the discrepancies between the CNEE and the distributor; (b) the dissolution of the Expert Commission once its pronouncement had already been issued could not have caused harm to EEGSA; and (c) given the advisory nature of expert pronouncements under Guatemalan law and the non-delegable nature of the CNEE\u2019s duties and responsibilities regarding adoption of the tariffs, according to the principles of legality and organization of the public administration, the pronouncement of the Expert Commission cannot be binding.\"213*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 126; Rejoinder, \u00a7 49 (a).\n\n2. The Claimant cannot file an appeal before the Arbitral Tribunal against the decisions of the Guatemalan courts, it can only file a claim for denial of justice but it has not done so\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, the Claimant is now asking the Arbitral Tribunal to act as an appellate court on these issues, which, is not possible, as has been established by many investment arbitration tribunals.214 The Claimant could only have submitted an international claim if it had claimed and proved that there was a denial of justice, which it has not alleged.215\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 79-83 and Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 62 *et seq.* citing *ADF Group Inc. v.

A State is internationally responsible only when this process fails, as Guatemala\u2019s conduct is not limited to the performance of the CNEE but also includes the actions of its courts.216\n\n***Ibid.,*** \u00a7\u00a7 113,117.\n\n249.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent contends that the Claimant only alleges that the decisions of the Constitutional Court were wrong or incorrect and that they appear to have been *\"influenced by political considerations,\"* but does not provide any substantiation, foundation, or evidence whatsoever for such contentions.217\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 45.\n\n250.\n\nTo the contrary, the Guatemala\u2019s Constitutional Court granted the Claimant a full opportunity to expound its arguments and issued reasoned and informed decisions.

The Iberdrola decision\n-------------------------\n\n251.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that its position on the lack of jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is supported by the decision of the tribunal in the Iberdrola case.219\n\n***Iberdrola*** Award, ***supra*** footnote 214.\n\n252.\n\nThe Iberdrola case is identical to the present case as to the facts. On the same facts, the Arbitral Tribunal decided that it was dealing with a claim under Guatemalan law and not international law, and that in order to deal with such claims it *\"would have to act as regulatory authority, as administrative entity and as trial court\"* As a consequence, after dismissing the denial of justice claim, the Iberdrola tribunal concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the case.220\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 60.\n\n253.\n\nRespondent also notes that the Iberdrola case was based on the BIT between Spain and Guatemala, under which the autonomous standard of treatment is more demanding than the international minimum standard applicable to this case. Even so, the tribunal found that the claims were not justiciable under international law.221\n\n***Ibid.,*** \u00a7 61.\n\n**B. Summary of Claimant\u2019s position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nAccording to Teco: **(1)** the claim concerns a violation of the Treaty and is not merely a regulatory disagreement. In any case **(2)** the Claimant argues that the basis for its claims is something that should be decided on the merits. Teco also argues that **(3)** it is not limited to bringing a claim for denial of justice, and that **(4)** the decision in Iberdrola is not relevant to the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n1. Teco\u2019s claim relates to a violation of the Treaty and is not a mere regulatory disagreement\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nRespondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections are unfounded and should be rejected because the Claimant is not pleading a mere regulatory disagreement. Nor is it asking the Arbitral Tribunal to act as an extraordinary court of appeal. What Claimant is asking for is a review of Guatemala\u2019s actions during the 2008-2013 tariff review process, in light of Respondent\u2019s obligation under Article 10.5 of the Treaty to accord Teco\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment.222\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 3.\n\n256.\n\nThe Claimant does not require the Arbitral Tribunal to act as a regulatory body or as an extraordinary court of appeal. Teco is in fact not asking the Arbitral Tribunal to decide whether the decisions of the Expert Commission were correct. Nor is it asking that it conducts a new tariff review for the 2008-2013 period or that it reviews Guatemalan court decisions. The point Teco is raising in this arbitration is that Guatemala was under an international obligation to comply with the Expert Commission\u2019s decisions, regardless of whether such decisions were correct as a technical matter under Guatemalan law. What the Arbitral Tribunal must decide is whether Guatemala acted contrary to its previous actions, in violation of the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations, or arbitrarily and in bad faith in re-calculating EEGSA\u2019s VAD for the 2008-2013 period. The Arbitral Tribunal is also called to decide whether there was a fundamental change to the legal and regulatory framework and therefore a violation of the Respondent\u2019s obligations under the Treaty.223\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 246 ***et seq:,*** Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 14.\n\n2. Teco\u2019s claims are to be decided in the merits\n------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in assessing its jurisdiction, the Arbitral Tribunal needs not establish that the claims are correct in substance. It is sufficient that it establishes that the facts alleged by the Claimant, if proved, would be likely to fall within the Treaty provisions.224 This approach is supported by a long line of consistent arbitral decisions.225 The Claimant avers that its claim and the underlying facts comply with the above requirement because, if proven, they would constitute a breach of the Treaty.226\n\nReply, \u00a7 284; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 9 *et seq.*\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi v.

The Claimant is not limited to arguing denial of justice\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2019s contentions, the decisions made by the Constitutional Court of Guatemala do not deprive the Arbitration Tribunal of its jurisdiction, nor do they limit the Claimant to making a claim for denial of justice.230\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 7.\n\n260.\n\nAs a matter of fact, such decisions have no res judicata effect with respect to the Claimant, as the causes of action in the present proceedings are different from those present in the Iberdrola arbitration. The parties involved are also different. Moreover, the fact that a domestic court has found the CNEE\u2019s actions to be lawful does not preclude international liability, as it is well established that a State may not rely upon the provisions of its own internal law to avoid its international obligations.231\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 7.\n\n4. The arbitral tribunal\u2019s decision in Iberdrola is not relevant to reviewing the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this case\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimant also avers that the decision in Iberdrola232 is not relevant because of the different way in which that case was presented.233\n\n*Iberdrola* Award, *supra* footnote 214.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 4.25 *et seq.*\n\n262.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant alleges that the Iberdrola tribunal erred to the extent that it concluded it did not have jurisdiction to consider issues of domestic law in a regulatory context, as investment tribunals frequently rule on issues of domestic law in determining whether there has been a breach of an investment treaty.234\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 5, 31 *et seq.* citing *loannis Kardossopoulos v.

In the present case it cannot be said that Teco\u2019s legitimate expectations arguments concern a mere regulatory disagreement under Guatemalan law. In fact, according to the Claimant, this is an aspect that does not depend at all upon the correct interpretation of Guatemalan law.235\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 43.\n\n**VI. POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON THE MERITS**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n264.\n\nAccording to the Claimant: **(1)** Guatemala breached Article 10.5 of the Treaty by failing to give fair and equitable treatment to Teco\u2019s investment, with the aim of imposing an unreasonably low VAD on EEGSA, and in doing so **(2)** it caused the Claimant to suffer damages for which compensation has to be paid.\n\n1. Guatemala violated its obligation under Article 10.5 of the Treaty\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Guatemala violated its obligation of fair and equitable treatment, first **(a)** when it modified fundamentally the legal and regulatory framework, contrary to its representations, thus frustrating Teco\u2019s legitimate expectations and, second, **(b)** when it engaged in unfair and arbitrary actions during the 2008-2013 tariff review process, with the intent of controlling the process and its outcome. According to Teco, **(c)** Respondent\u2019s actions constitute breaches of Article 10.5 of the Treaty.\n\n**a) The fundamental modification of the regulatory framework and the violation of Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nTeco argues that Guatemala made representations to the Claimant that were designed to induce it to invest in the country\u2019s electricity sector, and that after having obtained the benefit of a high price for EEGSA\u2019s shares, the Respondent frustrated Teco\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n267.\n\nContrary to the submissions of the Respondent, States are liable for failing to respect the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations.236 and the protection of legitimate expectations is a fundamental aspect of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment under the customary international law minimum standard of treatment237\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 245-258; Reply, \u00a7 254.\n\nReply, \u00a7 255, citing *BG Group v. Argentina Republic,* UNCITRAL Case, Final Award, December 24, 2007, (CL-9), \u00a7 310, (hereinafter *\"BG Group* Award\") which in turn cites *Waste Management* Award, *supra* footnote 214, \u00a7 98, and *Generation Ukraine* Award, *supra* footnote 214, \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 37.\n\n268.\n\nIn respect of Guatemala\u2019s argument that Teco did not exist at the time of EEGSA\u2019s privatization, the Claimant asserts that Teco is part of the same group of companies that originally acquired EEGSA, and that the acquisition in 2005 was merely an internal corporate transfer within the group. Moreover, according to Teco, the companies involved shared virtually all the same officers and directors.238 Accordingly, the Claimant argues that Teco shared the expectations of the other companies of the same group.239\n\nReply, \u00a7 67-68; Statement CWS-11, \u00a7\u00a7 10-11; Exhibits C-324, C-526, C-527, C-543, C-428, C-459, C-461, C-464, C-471, C-526, C-469, and C-472.\n\nReply, \u00a7 68.\n\n269.\n\nRegarding the violation of its legitimate expectations, Teco avers that Guatemala -by virtue of the specific provisions of the LGE and the RLGE,240 as well as the statements it made during the road show241 and in the Memorandum of Sale242 to promote the sale of EEGSA\u2019s shares - made the following representations, which it immediately thereafter betrayed: (i) that the VAD would be calculated based on a study commissioned by the distributor; (ii) that the VAD would be calculated on the basis of the VNR of a distribution network of a model efficient company; and (iii) that, in case of discrepancies between EEGSA and the CNEE on the VAD study, the discrepancies would be resolved by an independent Expert Commission.\n\nExhibits C-17 and C-21.\n\nExhibit C-28.\n\nExhibit C-29.\n\n*i. The VAD would be calculated based on the study submitted by the distributor*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Respondent made representations on several occasions according to which VADs must be calculated by a consultant chosen by the distributor.243\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 15.\n\n271.\n\nArticle 74 of the LGE provides specifically that the VAD components should be calculated by the distributor through a study conducted by one of the firms prequalified by the CNEE.\n\n272.\n\nThe Memorandum of Sale also stated that the VAD was to be calculated by distributors by means of a study commissioned from an engineering firm.244\n\nMemorandum of Sale, p. 63 (Exhibit C-29).\n\n273.\n\nTeco avers that such representations implied an essential guarantee for the investor, assuring the latter that it would play an important role in the setting of the VAD. This was an essential part of the balancing that the LGE struck between the distributor and the regulator in the tariff review process.245\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 11:34, \u00a7\u00a7 7 *et seq**.***\n\n274.\n\nThe Respondent nonetheless amended Article 98 of the LGE in 2007 to give the CNEE an option, in certain cases, to set the VAD on the basis of a study prepared by its own consultant rather than by the distributor\u2019s.246\n\nArticle 98 as amended in 2007 (Exhibit C-104).\n\n275.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, such an amendment was contrary to Guatemala\u2019s representation that the VAD would be established based on a study provided by the distributor, which involved a system of checks and balances between the regulatory authority and the distributors so that the tariffs would be set on the basis of objective and impartial criteria.247 Teco states that the amendment was also unconstitutional, as it modified a statutory provision by regulation.248\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 264: Report CER-1, \u00a7\u00a7 20-40.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 90: Report CER-1, \u00a7 40.\n\n276.\n\nTeco argues that, despite the illegality of said amendment, it decided not to challenge it in 2007, first because it considered that the new provision would not be applicable to it because EEGSA planned on submitting its consultant\u2019s studies to the CNEE in a timely and complete manner, and second because it did not want to strain its relationship with the CNEE at a time when the 2008 tariff review process was about to begin.249\n\nReply, \u00a7 100.\n\n277.\n\nThis amendment provided support to the November 18, 2009 decision of the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, in which the court approved the CNEE\u2019s decision to apply its own tariff.250 As a matter of fact, without such an amendment, there would have been no basis in the LGE or the RLGE for the CNEE to rely upon its own VAD study to calculate EEGSA\u2019s VAD for the 2008-2013 tariff period.251\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 214-215; Exhibit C-331, p. 15-20.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 20; Reports CER-3, \u00a7 78 and CER-1, \u00a7 67.\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimant therefore argues that this amendment of the LGE and the way in which it was interpreted by Guatemala was a fundamental departure from the regulatory framework upon which Teco had relied when making its investment.252\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 20.\n\n279.\n\nFinally, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s contention, its allegations regarding the 2007 amendment to Article 98 of the RLGE are not time-barred under the Treaty, because according to Article 10.16(2)(b-c) of the Treaty, the investor is not required to identify every measure about which it complains in its notice of intent. In any event, the Claimant did indeed identify this amendment in its Request for Arbitration.253\n\nIbid., \u00a723.\n\n*ii. The LGE established that the VAD would be calculated on the basis of the VNR of a distribution network of a model efficient company*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nArticle 73 of the LGE provides that the distributor\u2019s return should be calculated based on the VNR of a model efficient company, and Article 79 of the LGE states that the rate of return should correspond to a rate of between 7 percent and 13 percent of the VNR.254\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 261; LGE, art. 79 (Exhibit C-17).\n\n281.\n\nThe VNR, which is the basis for calculating the distributor\u2019s VAD, can therefore not be reduced by depreciation, since the concept of new replacement value is inconsistent with a depreciated value.255\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 33 and footnote 104; Exhibit C-246.\n\n282.\n\nThe Claimant avers that Guatemala introduced the model company concept in the LGE in order to increase EEGSA\u2019s privatization value.256 which explains why the consortium paid US$520 million for EEGSA despite the valuation, made some years before in the PW Report, of only US$13.9 million.257\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 262; Report CER-2, \u00a7\u00a7 59-64.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 62, and 271; Report CER-2, \u00a7\u00a7 58, 64 and 65.\n\n283.\n\nTeco, having paid a value higher than the actual value for EEGSA\u2019s assets, needed to recover its investment base through higher electricity tariffs guaranteed by the LGE.258\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 262.\n\n284.\n\nThis expectation was frustrated by Resolution No. 05-2008, which amended the FRC initially contained in the Terms of Reference and thereby cut by half the VNR of the model company. According to Teco, the exchanges between the CNEE and its consultant show that the unlawful calculation of the FRC was designed with the specific purpose of significantly reducing EEGSA\u2019s VAD.259\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 51 (footnote 239), 116, and 138-140.\n\n285.\n\nAccording to Teco, this provision violated the LGE as it depreciated by half the value of a fictitious company that should by law have been considered as new.\n\n286.\n\nThe Expert Commission confirmed that the FRC imposed by the CNEE in the Terms of Reference was contrary to the express provisions of the LGE. The CNEE misinterpreted the concept of the VNR as established in the law, and this had the effect of halving the return that had been promised to EEGSA.260\n\nReply, \u00a7 116, footnote 624; Exhibit C-246, p. 92.\n\n287.\n\nTeco also argues that, because of other irregularities committed by the CNEE, the latter imposed tariffs upon EEGSA based on a VAD that did not meet the expected rate of return.261\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 221, footnote 843.\n\n*iii. Discrepancies between the distributor and the CNEE on the VAD study would be resolved by an independent Expert Commission*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nArticle 75 of the LGE provides that, in case of discrepancies between the distributor and the CNEE on the VAD study, an Expert Commission shall pronounce itself on such discrepancies.\n\n289.\n\nFurthermore, when promoting the privatization of EEGSA, Guatemala reported in the Memorandum of Sale to potential investors that *\"in the event of discrepancy, a Commission of three experts will be convened to resolve the differences.\"262*\n\nExhibit C-29, p. 49.\n\n290.\n\nIndeed, the terms of reference for the 2003 tariff review provided that any discrepancies would be \"reconciled\" by the Expert Commission.263\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 278.\n\n291.\n\nThe CNEE also stated in November 2003, during judicial proceedings unrelated to this arbitration, that *\"[i]n the event of discrepancies, pursuant to Article 98* [of the RLGE] *and* [Article] *75 of the* [LGE], *an Expert Commission shall be constituted, which shall resolve* [the discrepancies] *in a term of 60 days.\"264*\n\nCNEE Answer to Constitutional Challenge 1782-2003 dated November 10, 2003, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-81), Scheme, p. 6.\n\n292.\n\nIn Teco\u2019s submission, the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Expert Commission\u2019s decisions were merely advisory and non-binding is disproved by Guatemala\u2019s own behavior. In fact, had it been so, Guatemala would not have attempted to interfere with the appointment of the chairman of the Expert Commission and to influence Mr. Jean Riubrugent.265 Respondent\u2019s position that the CNEE had the power to unilaterally calculate the VAD irrespective of the Expert Commission\u2019s determinations would also be inconsistent with its own argument that Article 98 bis, which provided for the possibility that the Government could appoint the chairman of the Expert Commission, was necessary in order to prevent indefinite delays in the calculation of the VAD.266\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 138-140; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 17.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 22, referring to Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 212-213.\n\n293.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s arguments that the mission of the Expert Commission was limited to noting the existence of discrepancies, or that the use of the verb *\"pronounce\"* in the LGE implied that the Expert Commission could only express a non-binding opinion, are opportunistic. Guatemala only adopted such positions once it found that the decision of the Expert Commission implied an increase in EEGSA\u2019s VAD.\n\n294.\n\nBoth the specific meaning of the term \"pronounce\" in a legal context267 and the logical meaning of said provision in the LGE as well as the other representations made by Guatemala indicate that the Expert Commission had the authority to resolve disputes between the distributor and the CNEE in a binding manner.\n\nReply, \u00a7 43; Exhibit C-50; Reports CER-1, \u00a7 76 and CER-3, \u00a7 38.\n\n295.\n\nThe representations made in this respect were relevant to the investor, as the powers granted to the Expert Commission ensured a fair, depoliticized and efficient method of resolving disputes between the CNEE and the distributor268\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 44.\n\n296.\n\nIn breach of the many representations made by Guatemala and the CNEE, the CNEE decided to ignore the Expert Commission\u2019s report and to instead impose a VAD based on a study prepared by its own consultant Sigla, which neither EEGSA nor its consultant knew about and in preparation of which they had no input.269\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 268.\n\n297.\n\nIn Teco\u2019s submission, it is only after having learnt of the Expert Commission\u2019s adverse rulings that the CNEE came up with the argument that the Expert Commission\u2019s role was limited to recording the differences between the CNEE and the distributor. It did so in order to justify its decision to dissolve the Expert Commission, disregard its report and impose a VAD based on the Sigla report.270\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 158-164; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 18; Exhibit C-547.\n\n298.\n\nThe Claimant also alleges that, in its decisions of November 18, 2009 and February 24, 2010, the Guatemalan Constitutional Court misinterpreted the applicable regulatory framework. According to Teco, those decisions are so devoid of reasons and so contrary to the law that it can only be concluded that they were motivated by political interest to prevent any increase in electricity rates, as shown in the statement of the President of Guatemala and uncle of the CNEE\u2019s chairman, Mr. Alvarez Colom, in which he stated that reducing tariffs had been an achievement of his administration.271\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 17 ***et seq:,*** Exhibit C-604.\n\n**b) Guatemala carried out the 2008 tariff review in bad faith and in an openly arbitrary manner**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nTeco\u2019s claim is also based on the fact that the Respondent conducted the tariff review for the 2008-2013 period in an unjust and arbitrary manner, intending to manipulate the process and control the outcome of the tariff review.\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s arguments in this respect relate to: (/) the issuance of the Terms of Reference which included illegal provisions; *(ii)* the unjustified rejection of the Bates White study; *(iii)* the attempts to tamper with the functioning of the Expert Commission; *(iv)* the unilateral dissolution of the Expert Commission before it had completed its work; and **(r)** the harassment of EEGSA\u2019s executives.\n\n*i. The issuance of the Terms of Reference for the 2008 review*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the CNEE drafted the Terms of Reference for the 2008-2013 period so as to require a reduction in the VAD while granting itself the right to interfere in and even stop the studies if it disagreed with their content, all this being contrary to the relevant provisions of the LGE and the RLGE.272\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 266; Report CER-2, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45; Statements CWS-3, \u00a7\u00a7 15-18, and CWS-6, \u00a7\u00a7 8-9.\n\n302.\n\nArticle 1.9 of the Terms of Reference was particularly controversial, as it gave the CNEE discretion to deem the distributor\u2019s study *\"not received\u2019* within the meaning of the recently amended Article 98 of the RLGE if any section of the study was lacking or even if, in its own judgment, this study did not conform to the Terms of Reference or was incomplete. According to the Claimant, this provision would allow the CNEE to position itself to ignore the distributor\u2019s study and replace it with its own study whenever it did not like the study presented by the distributor.273\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 99; Report CER-1, \u00a7\u00a7 4143.\n\n303.\n\nTeco challenged these Terms of Reference and only withdrew its appeal after the CNEE agreed to modify them and include two key provisions: Article 1.8, according to which the distributor only needed to make the corrections to the study that it deemed appropriate; and Article 1.10, stating that the Terms of Reference were only guidelines subject to the LGE and its regulations and that the distributor could deviate from the Terms of Reference if it considered that they contravened the LGE.274\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 106-107; Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 107-109.\n\n*ii. The unjustified rejection of the Bates White study*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the CNEE, for trivial reasons, refused to accept several stages of the Bates White study, thus hindering and delaying the normal procedure.\n\n305.\n\nGuatemala used frivolous excuses for not accepting the Bates White stage reports, such as the lack of signature from an EEGSA-authorized representative on the letter accompanying the stage reports of the study or the lack of a deed appointing the EEGSA consultant.275\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 113 *et seq:,* Reply, \u00a7\u00a7 117 *et seq.*\n\n306.\n\nFinally, after putting up several obstacles to the admission of the stage reports and having made several corrections to them, the CNEE decided that there were still discrepancies in the May 5, 2008 version of the Bates White VAD study and called for the formation of an Expert Commission, setting forth the discrepancies to be resolved. However, when dealing with this in its Resolution No. 96-2008, the CNEE distorted the presentation of the discrepancies to include aspects of the Bates White study to which it had not previously objected and which Bates White could not therefore have been able to either correct or answer.\n\n*iii. Attempts to manipulate the functioning of the Expert Commission by the CNEE*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nThe Respondent attempted to manipulate the functioning of the Expert Commission in various ways: through the adoption of Article 98 bis RLGE; by trying to establish that it would be the CNEE that would ultimately verify whether the consultant complied with the Expert Commission\u2019s rulings; and by maintaining improper contacts with the member of the Expert Commission appointed by the CNEE, Mr. Jean Riubrugent.\n\n*\u2022*  *The adoption of Article 98 bis RLGE*\n------------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nAfter convening the Expert Commission, Guatemala added Article 98 bis to the RLGE, allowing it to appoint the third member of the Expert Commission, in contradiction with Article 75 LGE.\n\n309.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, although this provision was not enforced by the CNEE because EEGSA would have challenged its retroactivity, its adoption demonstrates the CNEE\u2019s attempts to improperly, arbitrarily, and unfairly control the tariff review process in violation of Teco\u2019s legitimate expectation that the tariff review would be performed in a fair and depoliticized manner.276\n\nReply, \u00a7 249.\n\n*\u2022*  *The attempt to have the CNEE decide on the incorporation of the rulings of the Expert Commission in the consultant\u2019s study*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nDuring the negotiations to establish the Operating Rules of the Expert Commission, the CNEE sought to reserve for itself the last word on whether the Bates White study had implemented the Expert Commission\u2019s rulings, thereby allowing it to manipulate the outcome of the process.277\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 267.\n\n311.\n\nAn agreement was reached in this respect between EEGSA and the CNEE to include Article 12 of the Operating Rules. According to Article 12, the Expert Commission would be entrusted to review whether the VAD study had complied with the Expert Commission\u2019s decisions. The Operating Rules were communicated to the chairman of the Expert Commission.278\n\n*Ibid.* ***,*** \u00a7\u00a7 137 et seq.\n\n*\u2022*  *Improper communications with the expert appointed by the CNEE*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, contrary to the provisions of the LGE, according to which the experts should be impartial and independent, and contrary to the Operating Rules, according to which any ex parte contact with the members of the Expert Commission was prohibited, the CNEE remained in contact throughout the process with its expert, who was instructed to take decisions that suited them.279\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 139-140.\n\n313.\n\nIn particular, Teco argues that the emails exchanged between the CNEE and Mr. Riubrugent show that the CNEE had devised an unlawful FRC calculation with its consultant for the specific purpose of reducing the VAD, and then provided its own appointee expert, Mr. Riubrugent, with materials to support the CNEE\u2019s position within the Expert Commission.280\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 4; Exhibits C-494 and C-496.\n\n*iv. The dissolution of the Expert Commission*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nOnce the Expert Commission had issued its report and the CNEE had realized that such report would imply an increase in the VAD, the CNEE dissolved the Expert Commission without allowing it to review and approve the corrections made in the Bates White study. The CNEE thus disregarded Article 12 of the Operating Rules to which the parties had agreed. In addition, the CNEE threatened its expert, Mr. Riubrugent, in order to dissuade him from participating in the review of the corrected Bates White study.281\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 268.\n\n315.\n\nFinally, the CNEE ignored the report of the Expert Commission, as well as the statements of engineers Bastos and Giacchino according to which Bates White had corrected its study in compliance with the report, and it instead imposed a VAD based on a study prepared by its own consultant, Sigla, which neither EEGSA nor its consultant knew about and in which they had had no input.282\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 268.\n\n316.\n\nAs a consequence, unreasonably low tariff rates were set for the 2008-2013 period. Such tariffs were set arbitrarily, entirely at the discretion of the CNEE, in violation of the provisions of the LGE and contrary to Teco\u2019s legitimate expectations.283\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 268.\n\n317.\n\nThe tariffs set by the CNEE were economically unviable for Teco, which was forced to sell its shares in EEGSA for a price significantly lower than their value and at a substantial loss.284\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7217-219.\n\nv. *Harassment of EEGSA executives*\n-----------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that, after having carried out the 2008 tariff review, the Respondent took actions to harass EEGSA executives, ultimately forcing them to leave Guatemala.285\n\nIbis..\u00a7\u00a7208 *et seq.*\n\n319.\n\nIn particular, on August 26, 2008, the Guatemalan Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office petitioned the Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants against two of EEGSA\u2019s senior managers, including Mr. Mat\u00e9, on patently baseless charges. The warrants were issued by the Court on August 29, 2008. Although a provisional recourse of *amparo* suspending the arrest warrant was issued by the Criminal Court a few days later, Mr. Mat\u00e9, who was out of the country at the time, decided not to return to Guatemala.286\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 205; Exhibit C-299; Statement CWS-6, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71.\n\n320.\n\nTeco also notes that on September 1, 2008, while Mr. Calleja was on a radio program discussing the CNEE\u2019s unlawful actions and the severe economic consequences for EEGSA, his car was broken into and his laptop stolen. After this incident, Mr. Calleja also decided to leave Guatemala with his family.287\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 206; Statement CWS-3, \u00a7 55.\n\n**c) Guatemala\u2019s actions violated its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to Teco**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nTeco states that Guatemala violated its obligation to accord its investment fair and equitable treatment when it **(i)** substantially altered the regulatory framework, frustrating the legitimate expectations of the Claimant, and **(ii)** acted arbitrarily, illegally, and in bad faith during the 2008 tariff review process.\n\n*i. Substantial modification of the regulatory framework and frustration of the legitimate expectations of the Claimant*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that, just as in the case of actions of the *Media Council* in *CME* v. *Czech Republic,* the actions of the CNEE cannot be considered as part of the normal exercise of regulatory authority in compliance and enforcement of the law. To the contrary, the CNEE substantially changed the regulatory framework that had been established to attract investors and upon which Teco had relied to make its investment.288\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 269.\n\n323.\n\nA breach by the State of specific representations made to foster investment is a violation of the minimum standard of treatment.289 Contrary to Guatemala\u2019s contention, and as established by all tribunals constituted under NAFTA or other investment treaties having addressed the issue, the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations are protected.290\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 116, citing *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v.

They can also emanate from prospectuses or offering circulars in the case of a privatization even if such documents have not been prepared by the State when they are issued on its behalf.292\n\nReply, \u00a7 259,265-266.\n\n326.\n\nAs stated by the ICSID Secretary General, \"[ *t] he weight of authority suggests that an undertaking or promise need not be directed specifically to the investor and that reliance on publicly announced representations or well-known market conditions is a sufficient foundation for investor expectations.\"293*\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 258, citing Kinnear M. *\"The Continuous Development of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard\"* in *Investment Treaty Law, Current Issues III* (2009), A. Bjorklund, I. Laird, S. Ripinsky (eds.) (CL-73) p. 228.\n\n327.\n\nAs a consequence, if the State fundamentally changes its regulations or policies, whether through amendments to the existing regulation or by issuing a new and different interpretation of the same, this would defeat the legitimate expectations of the investor and would violate the obligation of fair and equitable treatment. The Claimant argues, relying on the *Total* decision,294 that although the obligation of fair and equitable treatment does not operate as a stability clause or prevent the State from changing its laws, in the case of long-term investments, regulations should provide a clear framework for future operations. The concept of regulatory fairness or regulatory certainty applies, and the State cannot therefore change its regulatory regime so as to prevent the investor from recouping its investment and making reasonable profits.295\n\n*Total* Decision, *supra* footnote 234, \u00a7 122.\n\nReply, \u00a7 260.\n\n328.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Guatemala failed to ensure a stable and predictable legal and business environment; it disregarded the system of checks and balances established under the LGE and the RLGE by ignoring the Expert Commission\u2019s Report and Bates White\u2019s revised study, and it fundamentally altered the legal and business environment under which Teco had invested in EEGSA.296\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 270.\n\n*ii. Prohibition of arbitrary, illegal, and grossly unfair actions*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment, as it has been understood in virtually all NAFTA arbitration decisions or under the Treaty, prohibits conduct that is arbitrary, grossly irregular, unjust, or idiosyncratic and behaviors that exhibit a complete lack of transparency and candor in an administrative proceeding.\n\n330.\n\nSeveral tribunals have established that, although it is not necessary to prove bad faith in order to establish a violation of the minimum standard of treatment, if it is proved that the State acted in bad faith this establishes a violation of the standard.297\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 115 *et seq.,* citing *Alex Genin and others v.

Damages\n----------\n\n333.\n\nTeco argues that the fact that the CNEE has fixed the VAD too low for the 2008-2013 period has caused it considerable loss and, in particular, it claims compensation for **(a)** lost cash flow that its investment would have earned had EEGSA been able to collect the VAD to which it was entitled between August 1, 2008, the date the CNEE imposed its tariffs, and October 21, 2010 when Teco sold its investment in EEGSA, plus **(b)** the difference between the actual market value of Teco\u2019s EEGSA shares in October 2010 with the VAD approved by the CNEE and the amount that its shares would have been worth had Guatemala not breached its Treaty obligations. In addition, Teco is also claiming **(c)** pre- and post-award compounded interest at a rate of 8.8 percent.301\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7202.\n\n334.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the compensation awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal must be complete, that is, it must compensate for the injuries caused by the internationally unlawful act and re-establish the status quo that would have existed but for the wrongful act.302\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 281; *Chorzow Factory* PCIJ, Ser. A. No. 17, 1928 (CL-15).\n\n**a) Profits lost between August 2008 and October 2010**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n335.\n\nRegarding Teco\u2019s lost profits between August 1, 2008 and October 21, 2010, the Claimant asserts that they constitute the difference between the actual historical results and the cash flow projection made by Mr. Kaczmarek if the Bates White corrected final report had been applied.303\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 284-286.\n\n336.\n\nMr. Kaczmarek used EEGSA\u2019s current and projected financial statements to calculate the loss of free cash flow of the firm,304 and estimated EEGSA\u2019s cash flows loss between August 1, 2008 and October 21, 2010 at US$87 million.305 As a consequence, Teco\u2019s loss, given its 24.3 percent stake in the company, was US$21,100,552.306\n\nReport CER-2, \u00a7 155.\n\nReport CER-5, p. 9, Table 3. Expert Kaczmarek concluded that cash flow in the \"but-for\" scenario was US$170 million, from which the cash flow in the actual scenario of US$83 million should be subtracted to get the amount of flow lost: US$87 million.\n\nReport CER-5, \u00a7 141, Table 14.\n\n**b) The loss in value of EEGSA\u2019s shares as a result of Guatemala\u2019s actions**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nTo determine the loss in value of EEGSA\u2019s shares, Mr. Kaczmarek calculated the value of the company in the current scenario, i.e. with tariffs set according to the values established in the Sigla study **(\"actual value\")** and compared it with the value that the company would have had if the tariffs had been fixed according to the corrected Bates White final study **(\"but-for value\").307**\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 283-286.\n\n338.\n\nMr. Kaczmarek calculated both values by three different methods: the discounted cash flow **(\"DCF\")** method, the comparable publicly-traded companies method, and the comparable transactions method. Then the expert assigned to each specific valuation method a certain weighting, depending on the level of confidence that he thought they deserved. Thus, he assigned a value of 60 percent to the DCF Approach, 30 percent to the comparable publicly-traded company approach, and 10 percent to the comparable transaction approach.308\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 296; Report CER-2, \u00a7 218.\n\n339.\n\nBased on these calculations, the Claimant\u2019s expert concluded that EEGSA\u2019s actual value was US$562.4 million and its but-for value US$1,479.3 million.309\n\nReply, \u00a7 303; Report CER-5, \u00a7 140, Table 13.\n\n340.\n\nMr. Kaczmarek then subtracted US$87.6 million from EEGSA\u2019s net debt as of October 21, 2010 and concluded that the capital investment of the Claimant, considering its percentage of 24.26 percent equity interest in the company, amounted to US$115,198,529 and US$337,683,311 in the actual and \"but-for\" scenarios respectively. Therefore, Teco\u2019s loss as a result of the decrease in fair market value of its shares in EEGSA is US$222,484,783.310\n\nReport CER-5, \u00a7\u00a7 140-141.\n\n**c) Response to criticisms of the Respondent\u2019s expert**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n341.\n\nTeco submits that the arguments used by Respondent\u2019s expert to criticize the reference made by Mr. Kaczmarek to comparable311 companies and the use of the comparable transactions method are incorrect.312\n\nReport RER-1, \u00a7 73.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 292 *et seq.*\n\n342.\n\nThe sample employed by Kaczmarek in fact included twelve businesses and nine transactions while, according to most leading practitioners, significant confidence can be derived from a sample of four to seven companies.313\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 293.\n\n343.\n\nMoreover, Teco rejects Guatemala\u2019s claim that the weighting of the various methods was arbitrary and results-oriented.314 and argues that the procedure to assign the weights was based on objective criteria. Mr. Kaczmarek had legitimate reasons to assign greater weight to businesses or operations that were the most similar to EEGSA.315\n\nReport RER-1, \u00a7\u00a7 72-76.\n\nReply, \u00a7 294; Report CER-2, \u00a7 108.\n\n344.\n\nRegarding the criticisms according to which the Claimant\u2019s expert underestimated the capital costs, the Claimant states that when calculating EEGSA\u2019s value, its expert properly projected EEGSA\u2019s actual capital expenditures316 rather than those of a model company, which is what the capital costs figures in the Bates White Study represent.317\n\nReport CER-2, \u00a7 40, Figure 9.\n\nReply \u00a7 296, Report CER-5, \u00a7 43.\n\n345.\n\nTeco also avers that Guatemala\u2019s expert miscalculated the amount of capital expenditures in the Bates White study by adding together the capital expenditures and the return of the capital portion of the VAD. Said expert\u2019s projections for EEGSA\u2019s capital expenditures are out of line with the capital costs of EEGSA itself or the amount of capital expenditures for other comparable distribution companies.318\n\nReply, \u00a7 297; Reports CER-2, \u00a7 40, Figure 9; CER-5, \u00a7\u00a7 39-41, Figure 2.\n\n346.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant argues that Respondent\u2019s expert did not calculate EEGSA\u2019s \"but-for\" valuation by using the Bates White study, but relied instead on Mr. Damonte\u2019s model, which does not incorporate all of the Expert Commission\u2019s rulings.319 The Claimant argues that it makes no sense to calculate EEGSA\u2019s value in the \"but-for\" scenario by using a model that does not accept the Expert Commission\u2019s rulings.320\n\nReply, \u00a7 299; Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 603. Expert Damonte, for example, failed to incorporate the decision of the Expert Commission on the FRC, preferring to create his own formula. While the Expert Commission formula allowed EEGSA to get a return on the 81 percent of the VNR, Mr. Damonte\u2019s formula depreciates the capital base by 30 percent.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 299 *et seq.*\n\n347.\n\nRegarding the value of Teco in the actual scenario, the Claimant agrees that the real transaction price of the company that is being valued is the best evidence of that company\u2019s actual value; in this case, however, the sale was of DECA II and not only of EEGSA, and the price paid by EPM did not specify the price paid for EEGSA, thus the Claimant considered it more appropriate to conduct the valuation using other traditional valuation methods.321\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 302.\n\n**d) Reasonableness of the valuation of Claimant\u2019s experts**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the three following additional tests show that its expert\u2019s valuation is reasonable.322\n\nReport CER-2, \u00a7\u00a7 155-156.\n\n*i. The internal rate of return*  ***(\"IRR \")***  *for the cost of equity*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nIn both scenarios, actual (0.6 percent) and \"but-for\" (7.7 percent), the IRR is below the real cost of equity (11.01 percent).323\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 300; Reply, \u00a7 304.\n\n*ii. The VNRs calculated by Bates White and Sigla*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nAccording to Mr. Kaczmarek, the valuation of EEGSA could be checked against EEGSA\u2019s VNR, which should approximate the fair market value of EEGSA. He submits that the valuation of EEGSA in the \"but-for\" scenario was within 6 percent of Bates White\u2019s VNR value, and that the valuation of EEGSA in the actual scenario was lower than Sigla\u2019s VNR because Sigla used the CNEE\u2019s FRC, which reduced EEGSA\u2019s return on capital.324\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 302 *et seq,* Report CER-2, \u00a7\u00a7 234-235.\n\n*iii. The selling price at which EPM bought DECA II*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nTeco received US$181.5 million for its share of DECA II, and analyzing the value allocated to each company of DECA II, EEGSA accounted for 62.2 percent, which, according to the Claimant, results in an implied valuation for EEGSA of US$498 million.325\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 305; Report CER-2, \u00a7 241.\n\n**e) Interest**\n---------------\n\n352.\n\nArticle 10.26(1) of the Treaty provides for an award of monetary damages and any \"applicable interest\". The Claimant therefore contends that it should be awarded both pre-award and post-award compound interest at a rate of 8.8 percent up to the date of effective discharge of the obligations.326\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7202.\n\n353.\n\nRespondent\u2019s expert Dr. Abdala acknowledged at the hearing that this would be an appropriate pre-award interest rate for the period between August 1, 2008 and October 21, 2010, since it corresponds to EEGSA\u2019s WACC at that time327.\n\n*Ibid:,* Transcript, Day 6, p. 1587, \u00a7\u00a7 7-13.\n\n354.\n\nClaimant argues that the same interest rate should be applied from the date of the sale of EEGSA up to the date of the award because Teco sold its interest in EEGSA as a result of Respondent\u2019s actions during the 2008-2013 tariff review.\n\n355.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, this same rate should also apply to post-award interest because, as explained by its expert Mr. Kaczmarek, there is no reason to differentiate between the rate applicable pre- and post- award.328\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7 202; Transcript, Day 6, p. 1599, \u00a7\u00a7 17-20.\n\n356.\n\nAs the ILC Articles on State Responsibility also recognize, interest must run until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.329\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 309.\n\n357.\n\nInterest should be capitalized annually, for it is now widely recognized that *\"tribunal practice has shifted towards awarding compound interest when requested by the claimant\"330*\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 311, citing Elihu Lauterpacht and Penelope Nevill, *\"The Different forms of Reparation: Interest.\"* in *The Law of International Responsibility* 618 (2010) (CL-51); F.A.

As a matter of fact, this would not be a commercially reasonable rate because it is not available to participants in the commercial sector. According to Teco, the Respondent does not cite a single case in which an arbitral tribunal has ordered capitalized interest to be paid at a risk-free rate.332\n\nReport RER-1,\u00a7\u00a7 108-111.\n\nReply, \u00a7 318.\n\n359.\n\nThe Claimant also rejects Guatemala\u2019s argument that interest accruing after the sale of EEGSA should be set at a risk-free rate because, since that time, the Claimant was no longer exposed to the risk of operating said company. According to Teco, that fact is irrelevant because EEGSA was valued by discounting projected future cash flows at the company\u2019s cost of capital333\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 320.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n360.\n\nAccording to the Respondent: **(1)** the dispute between the Parties in this arbitration relates to a difference of opinion regarding the application of the regulatory framework of the electricity sector in Guatemala, which is not covered by the minimum standard of treatment under the Treaty. The Respondent, nevertheless, answered the specific allegations made by the Claimant with respect to **(2)** the alleged frustration of its legitimate expectations, and **(3)** the alleged injust and arbitrary actions taken by the State in the tariff review process. Finally, **(4)** Guatemala addressed Claimant\u2019s claim for damages.\n\n1. The minimum standard of treatment under the Treaty does not cover Teco\u2019s claims\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nThe applicable standard is the minimum standard of treatment under international law in accordance with Article 10.5 of the Treaty. Guatemala contends that the Claimant therefore has the burden of proof of the *\"general and consistent practice of* *States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation\"* in order to provide content to the minimum standard of treatment, but it has not satisfied this burden.334\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 463.\n\n362.\n\nIn order to constitute a breach of the international minimum standard of treatment, the State\u2019s conduct must be particularly egregious against the investor\u2019s interests, as various Arbitral Tribunals constituted under NAFTA or other treaties have decided.335\n\n***Ibid.,*** \u00a7\u00a7 464 ***et seq.,*** citing ***Cargill*** Award, ***supra*** footnote 330, \u00a7\u00a7 284-286; ***Glamis Gold*** Award, ***supra*** footnote 290, \u00a7\u00a7 616-617; ***Thunderbird*** Award, ***supra*** footnote 290, \u00a7 194; ***Genin*** Award, supra footnote 297, \u00a7\u00a7 365, 367.\n\n363.\n\nThe international minimum standard of treatment accords an ample margin of appreciation to the State, it is therefore not to be applied to disputes stemming from supposed irregularities allegedly contrary to the domestic law, the determination of which is reserved for the local courts.336 Although the decision of a regulatory body may be subject to criticism or even be contrary to law from the perspective of the relevant domestic legislation, it does not for that reason alone violate international law. For this, the conduct must constitute a deliberate violation of the regulatory authority\u2019s obligations or an insufficiency of Government action falling far below international standards.337\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 468 *et seq.,* citing *SD Myers, Inc. v.

United States of America,* UNCITRAL; *EnCana v. Ecuador, supra* footnote 214.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 477.\n\n364.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the present case concerns discrepancies between the investor and the regulator regarding the interpretation of the regulatory framework and cannot be considered a case of direct and shocking repudiation of the applicable rules. Therefore, the Claimant\u2019s claims must be brought before the domestic courts.338\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 479.\n\n365.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s position is that a violation of domestic law does not breach the international minimum standard of treatment unless it is a manifest and unjustified repudiation of a right and the victim did not have access to domestic courts, that is, justice has been denied.339 However, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has already brought its case before the local courts of Guatemala, that such courts were available to hear its claims and have done so independently and impartially, as is clear from the various favorable decisions obtained by the Claimant.340 In any case, the Claimant has not alleged denial of justice in this arbitration.341\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 484.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 48.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00a7\u00a7 71 *et seq.* Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 49 *et seq.*\n\n366.\n\nFinally, the doctrine of legitimate expectations does not apply in the context of the international minimum standard of treatment, as the practice and *opinio juris* of State Parties to the Treaty demonstrate.342 Guatemala submits that the Claimant has yet to provide a single example of a violation of the international minimum standard of treatment in which the breach of legitimate expectations was found to be the basis of the State\u2019s responsibility.343\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 172.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 182.\n\n367.\n\nFurthermore, the autonomous standard referred to by the Claimant, although not applicable in this case, does not protect the mere ordinary expectations of an investor that a public authority will not breach a contract or will not commit any irregularity under the applicable regulatory framework.344\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 183-184, citing *Parkerings-Compagniet* Award, *supra* footnote 214, \u00a7\u00a7 332-333.\n\n2. The alleged representations made by Guatemala and the alleged frustration of Teco\u2019s legitimate expectations\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, contrary to Claimant\u2019s averment, the electricity regulatory framework under which Teco made its investment continues to be in effect because, although there have been some adjustments to the regulations, these are normal and were expected and accepted by Teco in the Authorization Agreements, which did not contain any stability clause.345\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 560-561 referring to the agreements authorizing EEGSA to distribute electricity of 15, May 1998 and February 2, 1999, see above, \u00a7 4.\n\n369.\n\nTeco\u2019s own attitude is inconsistent with its claims in the arbitration, as shown by the declarations of its CEO who, three months before initiating arbitration, stated that Guatemala was a market in which the rules were clear and there was certainty.346\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 44.\n\n370.\n\nMoreover, Guatemala rejects the idea that Teco could have created legitimate expectations at the time that EEGSA was privatized, because at that time Teco had yet to come into existence. Indeed, Teco was created in 2005 and it was only then that it acquired the shares in EEGSA, so expectations could hardly have been created based on the statements of Guatemala during the privatization process.347\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00a7\u00a7541 *et seq.*\n\n371.\n\nAlthough Teco has alleged that EEGSA\u2019s shares always belonged to the same group of companies and the expectations of the group were transferred to Teco, a simple reference to being a member of a group is not enough to exclude an analysis of the transfer of legitimate expectations. According to Guatemala, this would require inquiring into and demonstrating what the expectations of each company of the group were in relation to the investment in Guatemala.348 The Claimant has not proven that the company that acquired the EEGSA shares in 1998 had the same executives as Teco.349\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 178.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 178-181.\n\n372.\n\nWith regard to the regulatory framework and the tariff-setting process, Guatemala responded to the Claimant\u2019s allegations about **(a)** the amendment of Article 98 of the RLGE in 2007, **(b)** the FRC in the 2008 Terms of Reference, and **(c)** the role of the Expert Commission.\n\n**a) The amendment of Article 98 of RLGE in 2007**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nGuatemala contends that, contrary to the allegations of the Claimant, the 2007 amendment to Article 98 RLGE was not politically conceived to interfere with the 2008 tariff review, nor was it unconstitutional or in violation of the LGE.350\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 260.\n\n374.\n\nThe 2007 amendment originated in an amendment of Articles 98 and 99 of the RLGE made in 2003, which had solved some problems concerning the tariff review timeframe and sought to address the situation in which, for whatever reason, the distributor did not have a tariff schedule in place after the expiration of the existing tariff351\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 265-266.\n\n375.\n\nThe 2007 amendment to Article 98 RLGE sought to correct the undesirable situation that could arise if the distributor did not submit or correct its study, for in such cases the RLGE would have rewarded the distributor with the continued application of the existing tariffs, which could be beneficial for the defaulting distributor because in an efficient business system, the distributor tends to reduce costs progressively, which should result in a reduction of tariffs.352\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 277 *et seq.*\n\n376.\n\nIn any case, at no point before this arbitration did EEGSA or its shareholders ever object to the 2003 and 2007 RLGE reforms.353 In fact, given that the modification took place in March 2007 and the Claimant only raised the argument in its October 2010 Request for Arbitration, such claim falls outside the three year time limitation provided by Article 10.18.1 of CAFTA-DR and is therefore time-barred.354\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 283.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 21 and footnote 27.\n\n**b) The FRC in the 2008 Terms of Reference**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the FRC was established by the CNEE in the Terms of Reference for the 2008 review and EEGSA never disputed that provision.355 The argument put forward by EEGSA\u2019s consultant, Bates White, according to which they raised no objection to the factor two in this formula but simply ignored it because it was understood to be a mistake, cannot be admitted.356\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 306.\n\nStatement CWS-4, \u00a7 59.\n\n378.\n\nIn addition, this formula was adopted in the Terms of Reference of all other electricity distribution companies. Unlike EEGSA, other electricity distribution companies - DEORSA and DEOCSA - discussed it with the CNEE and reached an agreement to reduce the depreciation from 50 percent to 42.2 percent.357 According to the Respondent, calculating the return on a gross capital base would be contrary to the LGE, the basic principles of regulatory economics and the previous practice of the CNEE. Literature published on the subject by Mr. Giacchino himself also considered that to be the case.358 The Expert Commission shared that view.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 330; Reports RER-5, \u00a7 389 and RER-2, \u00a7 192.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 399; Rejoinder, \u00a7 447; Exhibit R-87, pp. 104-106.\n\n**c) The role of the Expert Commission**\n----------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nThe LGE only provides that the Expert Commission should \"pronounce itself\u2019 on the discrepancies between the CNEE and the distributor\u2019s consultant, and that it had a period of sixty days in which to do so.\n\n380.\n\nGuatemala contends, therefore, that **(i)** the \"pronouncement\" of the Expert Commission was not binding, and that **(ii)** the role of the Expert Commission was terminated when it pronounced itself on the discrepancies because there was no provision for any post-ruling procedure. In any event, **(iii)** the Claimant reiterates that those issues relate to the interpretation of the applicable domestic law and were already decided upon by the competent court.\n\n*i. Non-binding Pronouncement*\n------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nThe pronouncements of the Expert Commission on the discrepancies between the CNEE and the distributor\u2019s consultant were not binding and should be interpreted as a technical opinion for the benefit of the CNEE.359\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 501 *et seq.;* Report RER-3, \u00a7 48.\n\n382.\n\nThe Respondent points out that, under the LGE, the CNEE has the power and responsibility to approve tariffs and enforce the LGE.360\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00a7 502; LGE, arts. 4, 60, 61, and 71; RLGE, arts. 3, 82, 83, 92, 93(3) and 99.\n\n383.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, this interpretation is derived from the fact that there is no express provision establishing that the Expert Commission\u2019s report should be binding for the purposes of determining the VAD. On the contrary, the term \"pronounce itself,\" according to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, means to \"declare\" or \"show oneself to be in favor or against something.\"361\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 502 (d); Exhibit R-154.\n\n384.\n\nMoreover, under Guatemalan civil law, expert opinions are always advisory in nature. Article 3 of the Law on Administrative Proceedings provides that a decision by a technical body cannot be binding.362\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7\u00a7 161 *et seq.;* Transcript, Day 5, p. 1264, \u00a7\u00a7 15-19.\n\n*ii. Function limited to the pronouncement*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Respondent contends that nowhere in the LGE or the RGLE is it provided that the Expert Commission should perform any additional functions once it has made its pronouncement. Nor is there any statement regarding this in the presentations made by Guatemala prior to privatization, when the Official Commission was being incorporated, or in the contract between the CNEE and members of the Expert Commission. Therefore, once the Expert Commission has issued a pronouncement, the task returns to the CNEE which, according to the LGE and the RLGE, is the authority responsible for setting the distributors\u2019 VAD and setting tariff schedules. At no time is it stated that the Expert Commission could replace the CNEE in these tasks.363\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 432 *et seq.*\n\n*iii. These are aspects of domestic law that have already been decided by the Constitutional Court of Guatemala*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n386.\n\nIn any case, the Respondent asserts that both the role of the Expert Commission and the scope of its pronouncements are matters of interpretation of Guatemalan law that were decided by the Constitutional Court of Guatemala through fully reasoned decisions and after a properjudicial process in which all the Claimant\u2019s procedural safeguards were respected.364\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 124 *et seq.*\n\n387.\n\nFinally, the Respondent denies the allegations made by Teco that the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision were politically influenced. There is no evidence of any such influence and the Constitutional Court has demonstrated its independence on numerous occasions.365\n\n*Ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 33-34.*\n\n3. The alleged arbitrariness and injustice in the 2008 tariff review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant uses the term \"arbitrary\" to reinforce its claim without even elaborating on the concept of arbitrariness.366 Guatemala denies having conducted the 2008 tariff review in an arbitrary and unfair manner, and argues that the CNEE only fulfilled its role as laid down in the LGE to establish the terms of the review and to verify the VAD studies presented by distributors.367\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 525 *et seq.*\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 531-532; Reply, \u00a7 169.\n\n389.\n\nThe statements made by Teco\u2019s executives, their purchaser (EPM) and other foreign agents operating in the electricity market in Guatemala, as well as the actual figures regarding foreign investment in the country, all confirm that the system is not arbitrary and that there are proper legal safeguards in Guatemala.368\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 209, \u00a7\u00a7 17 *et seq.*\n\n390.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent replied to the Claimant\u2019s contentions regarding **(a)** the Terms of Reference for the 2008 tariff review, **(b)** the Bates White study and use of the Sigla study to calculate EEGSA\u2019s VAD, (c) Article 98 bis of the RLGE, **(d)** the alleged Operating Rules of the Expert Commission, (e) the alleged improper contacts between the CNEE and Mr. Riubrugent, and **(f)** the alleged harassment of EEGSA\u2019s executives.\n\n**a) The Terms of Reference for the 2008 tariff review**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nGuatemala notes that the terms of reference applicable to the previous tariff review for 2003-2008 granted the CNEE an equal or greater degree of control, and EEGSA accepted that at the time without any objection.369 In particular, the provision in Article 1.9 that *\"the CNEE may also consider the Study as not received if, in its own judgment, the results requested in the ToR were not included, such that the Study may be deemed to be incomplete, or to provide a partial or distorted portrayal\"370* already existed in the 2003-2008 tariff review terms of reference.371\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7301 *et seq.*\n\nExhibit C-l06, English translation provided by the Claimant.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 297.\n\n392.\n\nThe CNEE decided to make certain modifications in order to avoid the delays that the *amparo* procedure would entail, but without sacrificing any of its powers.372 In particular, the inclusion of Article 1.10 did not imply that the CNEE was delegating its legal power to approve the distributor\u2019s VAD study.373 as can be seen by comparing the wording proposed by EEGSA *(\u2018the consultant may vary, in a justified manner, the methodologies [...] based on its knowledge and experience\")* and the wording finally adopted (*\"in the event of deviations in the methodologies set forth [...] which must be fully justified, the CNEE shall make such observations regarding the changes as it deems necessary, confirming that they are consistent with the guidelines of the Study\")374*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 306.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 314-315; Rejoinder, \u00a7 299; Statement RWS-4, \u00a7\u00a7 6-8.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 299; Exhibits C-108 and R-44.\n\n**b) The Bates White study and the use of the Sigla study by the CNEE to calculate the VAD**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nGuatemala contends that, by rejecting the stage reports of the Bates White study, by making relevant comments to the consultant, and finally by stating their discrepancies, the CNEE was only complying with its legal obligations as a regulatory body.\n\n394.\n\nBates White refused from the beginning of the review process to submit supporting information and documentation that was necessary for the CNEE to perform an audit of the study. In addition, its study reports were not traceable, that is to say the interlinking between the data could not be verified375. In fact, this was one of the discrepancies brought to the attention of the Expert Commission, in respect of which it ruled in favor of the CNEE.376\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 513(a).\n\nExhibit R-87, pp. 15-17.\n\n395.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the first VNR calculated by Bates White in 2008 was up from US$744 million at the end of the previous period to US$1,695 million in the first March 2008 Bates White study, representing an increase of 245 percent in the required capital base, which is even more striking that Mr. Giacchino had participated in both studies. According to Guatemala, these figures are even more significant when compared with the predictions of Teco\u2019s *business model,* in which an increase in the 2008 VAD of between 2 percent and 3 percent in actual terms was projected.377\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 217, \u00a7\u00a7 4-10.\n\n396.\n\nThe VAD, initially estimated at US$552 million would also immediately change to US$454 million in the corrected May 5, 2008 study, and US$252 million in the July 28, 2008 version, reflecting the lack of credibility of the Bates White study.378\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 225, \u00a7\u00a7 22 *et seq.*\n\n397.\n\nFurthermore, in a meeting requested by the President of Iberdrola in Latin America, Mr. Gonzalo P\u00e9rez, the latter declared that the Bates White study was not useful and proposed that the CNEE agree on a limited increase of the VAD over the previous period, that is US$175 million.379 This, according to Guatemala, shows that the values contained in the tariff studies did not reflect the economic reality or an efficient VNR.380\n\nExhibit R-65.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 355.\n\n398.\n\nThe Bates White study did not comply with the LGE or with the Terms of Reference; it was full of errors and inconsistencies and could not be audited. In fact, the Expert Commission issued a pronouncement in favor of the CNEE in 56 percent of the discrepancies submitted to it, including the exclusion of underground lines, issues of traceability of the study, and non-use of comparable prices in the international market.381\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 390 *et seq.*\n\n399.\n\nGuatemala also affirms that the July 28, 2008 Bates White study did not incorporate the totality of pronouncements issued by the Expert Commission, as confirmed subsequently by a study of Mercados Energ\u00e9ticos.382\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 428 *et seq.;* Exhibit R-103.\n\n400.\n\nIn view of the above, the Bates White study was not reliable and the CNEE exercised its powers and responsibilities in accordance with the law when it rejected it and decided to instead use the Sigla study to calculate the VAD.383\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 511 *et seq.*\n\n**c) Article 98 bis of the RLGE**\n---------------------------------\n\n401.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the adoption of Article 98 bis of the RLGE in 2008 was only intended to fill a lacuna in the RLGE if the CNEE and the distributor failed to agree on the appointment of the chairman of the Expert Commission, in which case the RLGE did not provide a solution.384\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 353; Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 212 and 400 *et seq.*\n\n402.\n\nNothing can be inferred from the fact that Article 98 bis provides that the chairman of the Expert Commission should be appointed by the Government of Guatemala, because the appointment had to be made from names included in a list provided by both parties, and also because the LGE and the RLGE established the conditions that all the members of the Expert Commission should fulfill.385\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p 273, \u00a7\u00a7 1-10.\n\n403.\n\nIn any event, this provision was not applied in this case because the parties agreed to appoint Mr. Bastos as chairman of the Expert Commission. As a consequence, it cannot have caused damage to Teco.386\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 400; Memorial, \u00a7 135; Statement RWS-1, \u00a7 121.\n\n**d) The Operating Rules**\n--------------------------\n\n404.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the parties reached an agreement on the Operating Rules applicable to the Expert Commission, and in particular on the purportedly adopted Rule 12, which provided that the Expert Commission would be responsible for confirming whether the distributor\u2019s study reflected its opinions.387\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 363.\n\n405.\n\nAlthough these rules were discussed on several occasions and several drafts proposed by each party were exchanged, the parties never reached a final agreement on the Operating Rules, which were therefore never adopted.388\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 366.\n\n406.\n\nThis is evidenced by the fact that, even in the purported final version of the Operating Rules, the heading reads \"Proposed Operating Rules.\" Furthermore, as for any decision taken by an administrative agency of the State, any agreement by the CNEE regarding the Operating Rules had to be formalized in an official document. As a matter of fact and as a matter of law, State bodies do not exercise their authority through emails or simple letters but by way of official documents. It is also noteworthy that there is no mention of the purportedly adopted Operating Rules in the document establishing the Expert Commission or in the contracts signed between the experts and the CNEE.389\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 371 *et seq.*\n\n407.\n\nThe only documents presented by the Claimant to prove its claim are emails - more precisely internal EEGSA emails - as well as an email sent by Mr. Giacchino to the chairman of the Expert Commission without copying the CNEE.390 Such evidence is insufficient.\n\nExhibit R-79.\n\n**e) The alleged illicit contacts with Mr. Riubrugent**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, the exchanges of emails that took place in December and January 2008 between Mr. Jean Riubrugent and the CNEE are innocuous and were intended only to clarify technical issues,391 to exchange information and to make clarifications392 in order for the latter to have a better understanding of the position of the CNEE393.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 43; Exhibits C-567 and C-490.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 43; Exhibits C-499, C-504, and C-505.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 43; Exhibits C-489, C-496, C-501, and C-500.\n\n409.\n\nTeco\u2019s arguments in this respect are absurd because EEGSA appointed in the Expert Commission Dr. Leonardo Giacchino, who was its own consultant and had himself authored the Bates White study, which the Expert Commission had to analyze.394\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 43.\n\n**f) The alleged harassment of EEGSA\u2019s executives**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nThe arguments relating to the alleged criminal prosecution of EEGSA\u2019s executives only seek to give a political flavor to the Claimant\u2019s claim in order to raise it to the international level.395\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 456; Rejoinder, \u00a7 488.\n\n411.\n\nAt the time when the arrest warrant was issued, the tariff schedules had already been in force for almost a month. In addition, the Office of the Public Prosecutor is an agency of the Public Ministry, a local decentralized entity that acted on its own, and the CNEE executives had themselves been the object of similar complaints. In any case, the arrest warrant was revoked two days after issuance by the Court of Appeals in Guatemala City.396\n\nExhibit C-301.\n\n412.\n\nAs to the theft of Mr. Calleja\u2019s laptop, it is in Respondent\u2019s submission unfounded and frivolous, and was probably caused by the latter\u2019s own negligence. In addition, the Claimant did not present any evidence to prove the theft or the basis for its accusations.397\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 459.\n\n4. The damages\n--------------\n\n413.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, even if the Arbitral Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction and Guatemala violated its obligations under the Treaty, it must in any case conclude that Teco has not suffered any loss.398\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 494.\n\n414.\n\nThe Respondent presents **(1)** the main errors in the valuation made by Mr. Kaczmarek, to then **(2)** provide a corrected valuation of the alleged damage suffered by Teco, and finally **(3)** criticize the parameters of reasonableness advanced by experts Abdala and Schoeters.\n\n**a) The errors in Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s discounted cash flow valuation method**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*i. Operating costs projected by Mr. Kaczmarek*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n415.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s arguments as to its operating costs are not credible. Teco\u2019s expert estimated that EEGSA should have a high income to meet the future costs of operating and investment, but when he calculates the costs that EEGSA will actually incur in the future, he assumes operating and investment costs that are significantly lower, which results in an artificial increase in the company\u2019s value.399\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 601; Report RER-1, \u00a7 41.\n\n*ii. Mr. Kaczmarek \u2019s projections in the \"but-for \" scenario*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe projections made by Mr. Kaczmarek based on the July 28, 2008 Bates White study in order to calculate the historical and future damages are incorrect because he uses the result of the study without verifying whether its premises are reasonable or whether it properly includes the pronouncements of the Expert Commission in their entirety.400 The Barrera report is a preconceived analysis which was tailor-made to support the Bates White study and contains no genuine analysis of the validity of said study.401\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 603.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 499-500.\n\n417.\n\nThe July 28, 2008 Bates White study does not accurately reflect all of the pronouncements of the Expert Commission, as confirmed by the CNEE\u2019s consultant Mercados Energ\u00e9ticos, and by the expert Mr. Damonte,402 who, by incorporating the pronouncements403 of the Expert Commission, arrives at a VNR that is about 40 percent lower than that of the Bates White study.404\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 603; Exhibit R-103, Statement RWS-3.\n\nMr. Damonte states that to apply many of the pronouncements of the Expert Commission, additional information and optimizations impossible to achieve in the time available are required, Report RER-2, \u00a7 176.\n\nReports RER-2, Chapter 5 and RER-1, \u00a7 50.\n\n418.\n\nFurthermore, the level of depreciation used by Kaczmarek is inadequate, as he accepts the formula adopted by the Expert Commission without considering that the Expert Commission could not change that formula without overstepping its powers.\n\n419.\n\nIn addition, the formula adopted by Kaczmarek contains serious conceptual and implementation errors. The formula overcompensates the investor. As correctly pointed out by Mr. Damonte:\n\n*\"The formula proposed by the EC calculates the average of depreciation plus the return on capital, starting, in each tariff revision, from capital without depreciation and subtracting the accumulated depreciation each year for five years. [...] Conceptually, this means that each tariff period will begin with accumulated depreciation at zero, and it will be depreciated over five years only. In the next period the cycle will repeat. My conclusion is that, by applying it during various tariff periods, assets will be depreciating over five years and then all the depreciation accrued over the five years is reincorporated in the assets in* *the next tariff period. This procedure is clearly wrong, as evidenced by the Net Present Value Test.\"405*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 606, citing Report RER-2, \u00a7\u00a7 178-179.\n\n420.\n\nMr. Damonte proposes using the \"Constant Annuity\" formula, which is commonly used and in fact was used in the 2003-2008 review period. According to this formula, Mr. Damonte gets a depreciation factor of 1.42 for the capital base, which means that the network\u2019s accumulated depreciation is 30 percent and the return would be calculated on the remaining 70 percent.406\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 607; Reports RER-1, \u00a7 71 and RER-2, Chapter 6.3.\n\n**b) Errors in the valuation resulting from comparables**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the comparable valuation method used by Mr. Kaczmarek is not relevant in this case, and the DCF method should be preferred for the following reasons:\n\ni. The small sample size used (twelve public corporations and nine transactions) makes them volatile and rather unreliable.407\n\nii. The companies and transactions selected have characteristics different from those of EEGSA; as a consequence, the comparison is far-fetched.408\n\niii. The valuation is based on the EBITDA that was estimated by Mr. Kaczmarek by using the DCF method, this method however suffers from errors that make it inappropriate.409and\n\niv. The *ad hoc* weighting used by Mr. Kaczmarek in averaging is unjustified and biased. Mr. Kaczmarek assigns a greater weight to companies or transactions with higher multiples, thereby artificially producing a higher valuation for EEGSA.410\n\nReport RER-1, \u00a7 73, Mr. Kaczmarek admits he has the least amount of confidence in his valuation by comparables calculations for these reasons, Report CER-2, \u00a7 218.\n\nExhibit R-l 12; Report RER-1, \u00a7\u00a7 73, 76.\n\nReport RER-1, \u00a774\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a775.\n\n**c) The sale of DECA II reflects the correct value for EEGSA in the actual scenario**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nGuatemala contends that the best reference for establishing EEGSA\u2019s value in the actual scenario is the price paid by EPM to acquire the DECA II block of shares; such price in fact reflects the agreement between independent parties under free market conditions, and it is free from the possible errors that are inherent in the DCF method and from the lack of companies that could be properly compared to EEGSA.411\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 612.\n\n423.\n\nBoth Teco and Iberdrola have maintained that EPM\u2019s offer was a \"global value,\" and that it was impossible to identify the price paid for EEGSA in the DECA II transaction412\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 613.\n\n424.\n\nHowever, during the arbitration proceedings, Guatemala obtained a document prepared by Citibank, EEGSA\u2019s advisor in the sale of its shares, which shows a value of US$582 million.413 Thus, the Respondent contends that this value, which was provided by Teco itself, should be used.414\n\nReport RER-1, \u00a7 82; Exhibit C-531, p. 7.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 615.\n\n425.\n\nIn any case, in its reliance to the DCF method to assess EEGSA\u2019s sale price, Mr. Kaczmarek underestimated EEGSA\u2019s value by relying on an EBITDA for 2009 instead of more current information available at the time of the DECA II sale, that could have more precisely reflected the reality of EEGSA\u2019s business. The experts Abdala and Schoeters, who used that latter information, calculated the value as US$518 million,415 which is the value that ought to have been attributed to EEGSA in the alternative.416\n\n*ibid.,* \u00a7 614; Report RER-1, \u00a7 81.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 614-615.\n\n**d) Corrected valuation**\n--------------------------\n\n426.\n\nOnce its experts corrected the existing errors in the valuation submitted by the Claimant, the losses alleged by Teco are reduced to zero if the value of EEGSA provided by Citibank is used, or to US$8.1 million if using a value inferred from the sale in the actual scenario.417\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 508-510; Report RER-4, \u00a7 78, Table VI.\n\n427.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the damage is zero if the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the FRC should include a 50 percent depreciation. In this respect, Teco never sought or justified a modification of the FRC, as DEORSA and DEOCSA did.418\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 619.\n\n428.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, this is because, in the actual scenario, EEGSA invested less than expected, making greater funds available for shareholders.419\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 510; Report RER-4, \u00a7\u00a7 70-71.\n\n**e) Reasonableness of Messrs. Abdala and Schoeters\u2019 valuation**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n429.\n\nThe valuation of EESGA\u2019s VAD proposed by Messrs. Abdala and Schoeters is reasonable. As a matter of fact, the historical evolution of the VAD as well as the analysis performed by Messrs. Abdala and Schoeters are in line with the VAD of Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Alumbrado El\u00e9ctrico de El Salvador **(\"CAESS\")** (the main distributor of electricity in El Salvador).\n\n430.\n\nMoreover, Messrs. Abdala and Schoeters have suggested as an additional verification that the proposed VNR be compared to the Accounting Asset Base (or RAB), estimated at US$483 million, which is very similar to Mr. Damonte\u2019s corrected VNR (net of depreciation), which was estimated at US$466.8 million.420\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 496; Report RER-4, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 45-50.\n\n431.\n\nThe experts proposed by Guatemala present an additional proof of reasonableness by calculating the IRR prospectively at the time of the second tariff review (2008). This method, using the corrected model, results in a value of 7.3 percent, in line with the regulatory requirement of 7 percent.421 The IRR calculation proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek to support the Bates White study is completely incorrect422 because: (i) it refers to an IRR of the shareholder, which the regulatory framework simply does not contemplate, (ii) it includes activities that are not covered under the regulatory framework, which are thus unrelated to the alleged measures, (iii) it calculates the IRR from 1998, thus covering a period that is not related to the 2008 tariff review, and (iv) it takes into account the price offered in the tender, when nothing in the regulatory framework permits this.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 512; Report RER-4, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 517; Report RER-4, \u00a7\u00a7 51-67.\n\n**f) Interest**\n---------------\n\n432.\n\nThe Respondent argues that in order to update the historical losses claimed to their currency value as of October 21, 2010, it is necessary to actualize the presumed damages calculated by the cash flow method from the date the damages occurred until the aforementioned date, and in order to do so, it is necessary to apply an actualization factor based on EEGSA\u2019s cost of capital, which is best represented by the WACC.423\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 624; Report RER-1, Section V.\n\n433.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, it would be appropriate to use, post October 21, 2010, an actualization factor based on a risk-free rate, such as US 10-year government bonds (2.8 percent during the period of October 2010-December 2011)424. As a matter of fact, such a risk-free rate would reflect the fact that, starting from the moment when Teco relinquished its participation in EEGSA, it was no longer exposed to the risk of operating that company.425\n\nRespondent PHB Reply, \u00a7 175; Report RER-1, \u00a7111.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 626; Rejoinder, \u00a7 519; Reports RER-1, Section V and RER-4, \u00a7\u00a7 81, 83 and 84.\n\n**VII. THE PARTIES\u2019 REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimant\u2019s requests for relief**\n-------------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nIn its July 8, 2013 Post-Hearing Reply, the Claimant requested that the Arbitral Tribunal issue an Award:\n\n1. Finding that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the Claimant\u2019s claim arising under Article 10.5 of DR-CAFTA;\n\n2. Finding that Respondent has breached its obligation under Article 10.5 of the DR-CAFTA to accord Claimant\u2019s investment in EEGSA fair and equitable treatment;\n\n3. Ordering Respondent to pay compensation to Claimant in the amount of US$243.6 million;\n\n4. Ordering the Respondent to pay interest on the above amount at 8.8 percent, compounded from 1 August 2008 until full payment has been made; and\n\n5. Ordering Respondent to pay Claimant\u2019s legal fees and costs incurred in these proceedings.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s requests for relief**\n---------------------------------------\n\n435.\n\nIn its July 8, 2013 Post-Hearing Reply, the Respondent requested that the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n1. Declare that it does not have jurisdiction over the claim filed by TGH;\n\n2. Alternatively and subsidiarily, to reject each and every one of the claims made by TGH on their merits; and, in addition to either case;\n\n3. Grant any other compensation to Guatemala that the Tribunal deems appropriate and fair; and\n\n4. Order that TGH pay all costs of these arbitration proceedings, including the fees and costs of the Tribunal and ICSID as well as all fees and costs incurred by Guatemala for its legal representation in this arbitration, with interest prior and subsequent to the award being issued until the date of actual payment.\n\n**VIII. REASONING OF THE AWARD**\n--------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will first deal with the Parties\u2019 positions on jurisdiction **(A),** and then with the merits **(B).**\n\n**A. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n437.\n\nAs an initial matter, it is not in dispute that Guatemala, under the reservations that will be discussed hereafter, has consented to arbitrate claims arising from an investment under CAFTA-DR.\n\n438.\n\nIt is also not in dispute that Claimant\u2019s 30 percent shareholding in EEGSA qualifies as an investment pursuant to Article 10.28 of CAFTA-DR. Article 10.28 (b) of CAFTA-DR qualifies as an investment any asset that an investor owns or control, including shares in an enterprise.\n\n439.\n\nIt is equally not in dispute that Claimant\u2019s 30 percent shareholding in EEGSA qualifies as an investment under Article 25.1 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n440.\n\nFinally, it is not in dispute that the Claimant qualifies as an investor pursuant to CAFTA-DR.\n\n441.\n\nRespondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections are **(2)** that the Claimant raises a mere regulatory disagreement as to the interpretation of the laws of Guatemala, which cannot give raise to claims under CAFTA-DR, **(3)** that such disagreement was resolved by the Guatemalan courts and that the Claimant waived its right to raise a claim for denial of justice, and **(4)** that the Arbitral Tribunal should give deference to the jurisdictional decision made by the Iberdrola arbitral tribunal in favor of Guatemala.\n\n442.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will address each of these objections, after having defined the content of the minimum standard of treatment under CAFTA-DR **(1).**\n\n1. Minimum standard of treatment under CAFTA-DR\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n443.\n\nThe minimum standard applicable to this case is defined as follows in Article 10.5, paragraph 2, of the CAFTA-DR: *\"For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of fair and equitable treatment\u2019 and full protection and security\u2019 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide:*\n\n*(a) fair and equitable treatment\u2019 includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and*\n\n*(b) full protection and security\u2019 requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.\"*\n\n444.\n\nIn order to assess whether it has jurisdiction to decide the present dispute, the Arbitral Tribunal must determine whether the facts alleged by the Claimant are capable, if proven, of constituting breaches of the Respondent\u2019s international obligations under CAFTA-DR.\n\n445.\n\nAs found by many arbitral tribunals, in performing this task, the Arbitral Tribunal applies a *prima facie* test.426\n\n*Telefonica* Decision, *supra* footnote 225: *Bayindir* Decision *supra* footnote 225, \u00a7 197; *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic* *Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, April 22, 2005.\n\n446.\n\nClaimant essentially avers that Guatemala failed to accord its investment treatment in accordance with customary international law, in particular fair and equitable treatment **(\"FET\").**\n\n447.\n\nIn order for the Arbitral Tribunal to assess whether the Claimant has made a *prima facie* case of breach by Guatemala of its obligation to grant FET, it is necessary, as a threshold matter, to define the applicable standard under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR.\n\n448.\n\nIn this respect, Article 10.5(2) provides that FET under CAFTA-DR does not require treatment in addition to or beyond what is required by the minimum standard of treatment applicable under customary international law. Article 10.5 also provides that the minimum standard *\"includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal,* *civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world.\"*\n\n449.\n\nGuatemala avers that, under the minimum standard, the State conduct must be *\"extreme and outrageous\"427* in order to constitute a breach of Article 10.5.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 464.\n\n450.\n\nGuatemala relies, in this respect, on several awards made under the North America Free Trade Agreement **(\"NAFTA\").428**\n\n*Cargill* Award, *supra* footnote 330, \u00a7 296: *Glamis Gold* Award, *supra* footnote 290, \u00a7\u00a7 616-617; *Thunderbird* Award, *supra* footnote 290, \u00a7 194; Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 474 *et seq.*\n\n451.\n\nGuatemala further submits that, unless the State conduct constitutes *\"a deliberate violation of the regulatory authority\u2019s duties and obligations or an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards\"429,* any dispute as to the State\u2019s regulatory conduct should be submitted to the local courts, and *\"only if the local court has committed a denial of justice may a claim of unfair and inequitable treatment be submitted to an international tribunal.\"430*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 477.\n\nIbid., \u00a7 480.\n\n452.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the minimum standard of FET prohibits conduct that is arbitrary, grossly irregular, unjust or idiosyncratic, and behaviors that exhibit a complete lack of transparency and candor in an administrative proceeding.431\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 233, citing *Waste Management* Award, *supra* footnote 214, \u00a7 98: *\"Taken together, the S.D. Myers, Mondev, ADF and Loewen cases suggest that the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.\"*\n\n453.\n\nThe Claimant also considers that although it is not necessary to prove bad faith in order to establish a violation of the minimum standard, such a violation is established if the State acted in bad faith.432\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 114 *et seq.,* citing *Genin* Award, *supra* footnote 297, and *Glamis Gold* Award, *supra* footnote 290.\n\n454.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that the minimum standard of FET under Article 10.5 of CAFTA-DR is infringed by conduct attributed to the State and harmful to the investor if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.\n\n455.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the many arbitral tribunals433 and authorities434 that have confirmed that such is the content of the minimum standard of treatment in customary international law.\n\n*Waste Management* Award, *supra* footnote 214, \u00a7 98; *Glamis Gold* Award, *supra* footnote 290, \u00a7 627.\n\nGrierson-Weiler and Laird \"Standards of Treatment\", Chapter 8, *The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law,* Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 270-271; MacLachlan, Shore, and Weininger \"Treatment of Investors\", Chapter 7, *International Investment Arbitration,* Oxford University Press, 2007, pp 226 *et seq.*\n\n456.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal also considers that the minimum standard is part and parcel of the international principle of good faith435. There is no doubt in the eyes of the Arbitral Tribunal that the principle of good faith is part of customary international law436 as established by Article 38.1(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, and that a lack of good faith on the part of the State or of one of its organs should be taken into account in order to assess whether the minimum standard was breached.\n\nGrierson-Weiler and Laird, \"Standards of Treatment\", Chapter 8, *The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law,* p. 272, as well as the authors and decisions quoted in footnote 31; in particular, Schreuer \"Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice, 6 *JWIT,* \u00a7 384: *\"Arbitral Tribunals have confirmed that good faith is inherent in fair and equitable treatment\",* and Dolzer \"Fair and Equitable Treatment: a Key Standard in Investment Treaties\" 39 *Int\u2019Law* 87 (2005) \u00a7 91. *\"The substance of the standard of fair and equitable treatment will in large part overlap with the meaning of a good faith clause in its broader setting, with one significant aspect embracing the related notions of venire contra factum proprium and estoppel'.*\n\nAnthony D\u2019Amato \"Good Faith\" in *Encyclopedia of Public International Law,* 1992, p. 600: *\"The principle of good faith is rooted in a natural law conception of customary international law. [...] The principle of good faith thus owes its present authoritative status to the natural law foundations of general international law, to customary international law as derived from the articulation of that custom in numerous treaties [...]\".*\n\n457.\n\nFinally, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that, pursuant to Article 10.5 of CEFTA-DR, a lack of due process in the context of administrative proceedings such as the tariff review process constitutes a breach of the minimum standard. In assessing whether there has been such a breach of due process, it is relevant that the Guatemalan administration entirely failed to provide reasons for its decisions or disregarded its own rules.\n\n458.\n\nBased on such principles, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that a willful disregard of the fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework is based, a complete lack of candor or good faith on the part of the regulator in its dealings with the investor, as well as a total lack of reasoning, would constitute a breach of the minimum standard.437\n\nFor abuse of authority, Grierson-Weiler and Laird, \"Standards of Treatment\" in *The Oxford Handbook of Investment International Law,* Oxfords University Press, 2008, pp. 284 *et seq.*\n\n459.\n\nIn the case at hand, the Claimant alleges that Guatemala\u2019s actions infringed *\"a sense of fairness, equity and reasonableness\"438,* and *\"constitutes an unexpected and shocking repudiation of* [the LGE\u2019s] *policy\u2019s very purpose and goals or otherwise subverts a domestic law or policy for an ulterior motive.\"439*\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 280, citing *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, Award, March 31, 2010 (CL-29), \u00a7 210.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 280 citing *Cargill* Award, *supra* footnote 330, \u00a7 293.\n\n460.\n\nEssentially, the Claimant alleges that, by failing to abide by the conclusions of the Expert Commission and by unilaterally imposing a tariff based on its own consultant\u2019s study, Guatemala repudiated the fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework was based and upon which it relied when making the investment.440\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7 134.\n\n461.\n\nThe Claimant also alleges that the CNEE failed to act in good faith in the process of establishing the tariff for 2008-2013, and acted in manifest breach of the law in disbanding the Expert Commission in July 2008.441\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 143 ***et seq.***\n\n462.\n\nSuch allegations are supported by evidence that the Arbitral Tribunal will have to assess.\n\n463.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, such behavior does not only constitute a breach of the regulatory framework established by Guatemala, but also a breach of Respondent\u2019s international obligations under CAFTA-DR.442\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7\u00a7 38 ***et seq.***\n\n464.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Claimant has made allegations that are such, if proved, as to establish a breach of Guatemala\u2019s obligations under the minimum standard, as defined in previous sections of this award.\n\n465.\n\nThere is in fact no doubt in the eyes of the Arbitral Tribunal that, if the Claimant proves that Guatemala acted arbitrarily and in complete and willful disregard of the applicable regulatory framework, or showed a complete lack of candor or good faith in the regulatory process, such behavior would constitute a breach of the minimum standard.\n\n2. The alleged mere regulatory nature of the dispute\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n466.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal disagrees with Guatemala\u2019s argument that Teco\u2019s claim, in spite of its \"labeling\" as a breach of international law, would be no more than a domestic dispute on the interpretation of Guatemalan law, which does not fall within the jurisdiction of an international tribunal.443\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 3,100-106.\n\n467.\n\nAs said above, this dispute is about whether the Respondent breached its obligations under the minimum standard of treatment. It is an international dispute in which the Arbitral Tribunal will be called to apply international law.\n\n468.\n\nThe fact that, in order to assess the Respondent\u2019s alleged responsibility in international law, the Arbitral Tribunal will have to decide certain points of interpretation of the regulatory framework by applying Guatemalan law, does not and cannot deprive the Arbitral Tribunal of its jurisdiction.\n\n469.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention is very clear in that international tribunals can and must apply the laws of the host State to the questions in dispute that are submitted to such law.\n\n470.\n\nHowever, in spite of the fact that this Arbitral Tribunal will have to apply Guatemalan law to some of the questions in dispute, the fundamental question that this Arbitral Tribunal ultimately has to decide is, on the evidence, whether the Respondent\u2019s behavior is such as to constitute a breach of the minimum standard of treatment under international law.\n\n3. The Parties\u2019 disagreement was allegedly resolved by the Guatemalan courts and the Claimant waived its right to raise a claim for denial of justice\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n471.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal also disagrees with the conclusions drawn by Guatemala from the absence of a denial of justice claim.\n\n472.\n\nThe fact that the Claimant did not make the argument that there was a denial of justice in Guatemalan judicial proceedings cannot deprive the Arbitral Tribunal of its jurisdiction to assess whether the Respondent\u2019s conduct was in breach of its international obligations.\n\n473.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case is in fact not based on denial of justice before the Guatemalan courts, but primarily on the arbitrary conduct of the CNEE in establishing the tariff, as well as on an alleged lack of due process in the tariff review process.\n\n474.\n\nIt is indeed true that the Guatemalan courts have decided some of the questions in dispute concerning the interpretation of the Guatemalan regulatory framework and the regularity of some of the CNEE\u2019s decisions under such law. It is also true that this Arbitral Tribunal will have to apply Guatemalan law to some of the regulatory aspects of the dispute, and that, in so doing, it may have to defer to the decisions made by the Guatemalan courts when such aspects of the dispute are subject to Guatemalan law.\n\n475.\n\nHowever, the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s task is fundamentally to assess the legal relevance of the facts under customary international law. As a consequence, although the decisions made by the Constitutional Court of Guatemala will have consequences on the findings that the Arbitral Tribunal will have to make under Guatemalan law, such circumstance cannot deprive the Arbitral Tribunal of its jurisdiction to decide the case under international law. In addition, as will be discussed further, the parties in the Guatemalan court proceedings were in any event different.\n\n476.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal disagrees with Guatemala that the Claimant asks it *\"to act as an appellate court of third or fourth instance in matters governed by Guatemalan law.\"444*\n\n***Ibid., \u00a719.***\n\n477.\n\nThis Tribunal\u2019s task is not and cannot be to review the findings made by the courts of Guatemala under Guatemalan law. The Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s task is rather to apply international law to the facts in dispute, including the content of Guatemalan law as interpreted by the Constitutional Court.\n\n478.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal also disagrees that *\"Guatemala cannot be held responsible under the treaty and international law solely on the basis of whether an entity such as the CNEE has acted rightly or wrongly in the exercise of its functions.\"445*\n\n***Ibid.,*** \u00a7 114.\n\n479.\n\nIt is in fact undisputed (for Guatemala did not make an argument to the contrary) that the CNEE is a State organ and that its actions are attributable to Guatemala in international law. The conduct of a state organ such as the CNEE is indeed attributable to the State. Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides to that effect that: *\"The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State\",* and that *\"an organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\"446*\n\nDraft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of the International Law Commission of the United Nations.\n\n480.\n\nIf the behavior of the CNEE is found to have been grossly unfair or idiosyncratic, or if the CNEE is found to have acted in bad faith or with a complete lack of candor in the regulatory process, such a behavior would constitute a breach of the minimum standard in international law.\n\n481.\n\nIn particular, would the Arbitral Tribunal find - as the Claimant avers - that the CNEE willfully disregarded the fundamental principles of the regulatory framework in force at the time of the tariff review process in dispute, such a disregard would amount to a breach of international law.\n\n482.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal also disagrees with Guatemala\u2019s contention that, in case of disagreement on the actions or decisions taken by the regulator *\"the State cannot be held responsible [...] since another branch of the Government, the judiciary, has been called to intervene and has issued a decision on the matter.\"447*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 113.\n\n483.\n\nAs a matter of fact, as said above, the disputes resolved by the Guatemalan judiciary are not the same as the one which this Arbitral Tribunal now has to decide. The Arbitral Tribunal may of course give deference to what was decided as a matter of Guatemalan law by the Guatemalan Constitutional Court. However, such decisions made under Guatemalan law cannot be determinative of this Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the application of international law to the facts of the case.\n\n484.\n\nIn addition, as said above, the loss allegedly suffered by the Claimant derives primarily from the actions taken by the CNEE, rather than from the decisions made by the Guatemalan judiciary. As a consequence, there is no need for the Claimant to establish a denial of justice in order to find the State in breach of its international obligations as a consequence of the actions taken by the CNEE.\n\n4. The Iberdrola tribunal made a jurisdictional finding in favor of Guatemala\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n485.\n\nThe Respondent has in several occasions relied on the award made on 17 August 2012 by the Iberdrola arbitral tribunal. The Respondent did not however submit that the Iberdrola decision would have *res judicata* effects in the present case, or that it would be binding or have the value of a precedent. Guatemala has nonetheless underlined that the Iberdrola case is identical to the present one as to the facts, and that the Iberdrola tribunal had to apply an autonomous standard of treatment which is more demanding for the States than the minimum standard applicable to the present case.448\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7\u00a7 75-76; ***Iberdrola*** Award, ***supra*** footnote 214.\n\n486.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has made it clear, in the course of this arbitration, that it would not rely on evidence presented in the Iberdrola arbitration.449 Although the factual matrix in both cases is similar, the applicable treaties and the parties are different. In addition, the legal arguments and the evidence have been presented differently.\n\nLetters from the Arbitral Tribunal to the Parties dated February 10, 2012, October 23, 2012, and June 27, 2013.\n\n487.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s task is to resolve the present dispute on the basis of the legal arguments and the evidence presented before it. As a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal, in making its findings on jurisdiction, cannot and will not rely on the findings of the Iberdrola tribunal.\n\n488.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction to decide the dispute.\n\n**B. Merits**\n-------------\n\n489.\n\nThe present dispute essentially rests on an allegation of abuse of power by the regulator and disregard of the regulatory framework in the context of an administrative tariff review process.\n\n490.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal, in deciding this dispute, is mindful of the deference that international tribunals should pay to a sovereign State\u2019s regulatory powers.\n\n491.\n\nAs the Methanex tribunal stated: *\"as a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and, which affects, inter alias, a foreign investor or investment, is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.\"450* The Arbitral Tribunal agrees.\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. the United States of America,* UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Final Award, August 3, 2005, \u00a7 7 of part IV.\n\n492.\n\nHowever, the deference to the State\u2019s regulatory powers cannot amount to condoning behaviors that are manifestly arbitrary, idiosyncratic, or that show a complete lack of candor in the conduction of the regulatory process.\n\n493.\n\nAs a consequence, although the role of an international tribunal is not to second-guess or to review decisions that have been made genuinely and in good faith by a sovereign in the normal exercise of its powers, it is up to an international arbitral tribunal to sanction decisions that amount to an abuse of power, are arbitrary, or are taken in manifest disregard of the applicable legal rules and in breach of due process in regulatory matters.\n\n494.\n\nIn order to support their respective positions, the Parties have made opposed submissions as to the content of the regulatory framework. The Arbitral Tribunal will thus first **(1)** address the Parties\u2019 disagreements as to the interpretation of the LGE and the RLGE.\n\n495.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will then **(2)** address the Parties\u2019 arguments as to the alleged representations made by the Respondent to the Claimant, and Claimant\u2019s alleged legitimate expectations deriving from such representations.\n\n496.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will then **(3)** deal with the Parties\u2019 arguments relating to the Respondent\u2019s behavior, and **(4)** decide whether such behavior constitutes a breach of Respondent\u2019s international obligations.\n\n1. The Parties\u2019 disagreements as to the regulatory framework\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case is based in large part on the assertion that the CNEE willfully and without reasons disregarded the regulatory framework applicable to the setting of electricity tariffs in Guatemala, as established by the LGE and the RLGE.\n\n498.\n\nThe Parties are however in disagreement not only on the interpretation of certain specific provisions of the LGE and the RLGE, but also on the fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework is premised as far as the tariff review process is concerned.\n\n499.\n\nIt is therefore necessary, before entering into any analysis of Claimant\u2019s assertions that the CNEE disregarded the regulatory framework, to address these disagreements.\n\n500.\n\nIn dealing with these matters, the Arbitral Tribunal will apply Guatemalan law, in light of the relevant findings of the Guatemala Constitutional Court.451\n\nArticle 42.1 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n501.\n\nThe regulatory framework establishes two sets of rules regarding the establishment of electricity tariffs. The first relates to the method of calculation of the tariff, while the second - which the Tribunal considers of greater relevance for the solution of this dispute - applies to the regulatory process leading to the establishment of the tariff.\n\n502.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that, as far as the regulatory process leading to the establishment of the tariffs is concerned, the regulatory framework rests on two clear fundamental principles.\n\n503.\n\nThe first is that **(b),** save in the limited exceptions set by the regulatory framework, the tariff would be established based on a VAD study made by a consultant commissioned by the distributor.\n\n504.\n\nThe second is that (c), in case of disagreement between the distributor and the CNEE on such study, a neutral Expert Commission would be called to pronounce itself.\n\n505.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that both principles are the cornerstone of the regulatory framework as far as the tariff review process is concerned.\n\n506.\n\nBy providing that the tariff would be established based on a VAD study realized by the distributor\u2019s consultant, the regulatory framework guarantees that the distributor would have an active role in determining the VAD and prevents the regulator from determining it alone and discretionally, save in limited circumstances.\n\n507.\n\nBy providing that the regulator would have to make reasoned observations on the distributor\u2019s VAD study, the regulatory framework also ensured that setting the tariff would be a bilateral and cooperative process.\n\n508.\n\nFinally, by providing that an Expert Commission would pronounce itself on any disagreement between the regulator and the distributor concerning the VAD, the regulatory framework intended to ensure the neutrality and objectivity of the tariff review process.\n\n509.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will examine these principles in more detail in following sections of this award.\n\n510.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will then deal with the Parties\u2019 disagreement on the effects of the Terms of Reference and whether Bates Whites and the Expert Commission were allowed to depart from the same **(d).**\n\n511.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Arbitral Tribunal will discuss the extent to which it needs to give deference to the decisions made by the Constitutional Court on matters of interpretation of the LGE and the RLGE **(a).**\n\n**a) Relevance in this arbitration of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n512.\n\nAs explained in previous sections of this award452, further to several sets of judicial proceedings initiated by EEGSA, the Constitutional Court of Guatemala rendered two decisions.\n\nSee above, \u00a7\u00a7 233-235.\n\n513.\n\nThe first is dated November 18, 2009 and essentially decides that, because the Expert Commission\u2019s report is not binding upon the CNEE and because the regulator has the exclusive power to set the tariffs, the CNEE was entitled to fix the tariffs on the basis of its own independent study.\n\n514.\n\nThe second is dated February 24, 2010 and essentially decides that the CNEE was entitled to disband the Expert Commission on July 28, 2008.\n\n515.\n\nGuatemala has submitted on several occasions that these decisions have disposed of the dispute submitted to this Arbitral Tribunal.453 The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 124 ***et seq.***\n\n516.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the decisions of the Constitutional Court cannot have the effect of a precedent or have any *res judicata* effect in this arbitration. Nor can they obviously have disposed of the present dispute.\n\n517.\n\nNot only are the parties different (EEGSA and the CNEE before the national court and Teco and Guatemala in this arbitration), but this Tribunal has to resolve an entirely different dispute on the basis of different legal rules. The Arbitral Tribunal has to assess whether the regulator\u2019s conduct materializes a breach of the State\u2019s obligations under the customary international law minimum standard.\n\n518.\n\nAs a consequence, this Arbitral Tribunal is not bound by the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions.\n\n519.\n\nThe findings of the Constitutional Court may nevertheless be relevant to the solution of the present international law dispute. However, this is only so insofar as the Constitutional Court interpreted aspects of the regulatory framework that are submitted to Guatemalan law and which the Arbitral Tribunal finds of relevance in order to assess whether the State\u2019s international obligations were breached.\n\n**b) Establishment of the tariff based on the distributor\u2019s consultant study**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n520.\n\nIt is undisputed that the electricity tariffs, under Article 71 of the LGE, are based on *\"the sum of the weighted price of all the distributor purchases referenced to the inlet* *to the distribution network and the Valued Added Distribution\"* (Valor Agregado de Distribuci\u00f3n - VAD).454 The VAD is therefore one of the factors that is used by the CNEE in fixing the tariffs.\n\nLGE art. 71, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17).\n\n521.\n\nIt is also undisputed that, pursuant to Article 71 of the LGE, the VAD is *\"the average* *cost of capital and operation of a distribution network of a benchmark efficient*  *company operating in a given density area.\"*455\n\n***Ibid.***\n\n522.\n\nPursuant to Article 74 of the LGE, *\"each distributor shall calculate the VAD components through a study entrusted to an engineering firm prequalified by the Commission. The Commission may decide that several distributors commission only one study if the distribution densities are similar in each group and use only one VAD to determine the rates of all qualified companies in the same group.\"456*\n\n***Ibid.,*** art. 74.\n\n523.\n\nArticle 97, second paragraph of the RLGE, provides that the CNEE establishes a list of pre-qualified consultants amongst which the distributor elects the one entrusted to realize its VAD study. Article 97 of the RLGE, third paragraph, provides for the obligation for each distributor to contract one of the pre-qualified consultants to establish its VAD study.\n\n524.\n\nArticle 98 of the RLGE sets limited circumstances in which the regulator may disregard the distributor\u2019s study and establish the VAD based on its own unilateral study.\n\n525.\n\nArticle 98 provides to that effect that *\"in case of the distributor's failure to deliver the studies or the corrections to same, the Commission shall be empowered to issue and publish the corresponding tariff schedule, based on the tariff study the Commission performs independently or performing the corrections to the studies begun by the distributor.\"457*\n\nRLGE, art. 98, English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-105).\n\n526.\n\nArticle 98 therefore clearly establishes that the CNEE could calculate the VAD on the basis of its own independent study in two limited occurrences: (i) in case of a failure by the distributor to deliver its own study, or (ii) in case of a failure by the distributor to correct its study according to the LGE and the RLGE.\n\n527.\n\nThe LGE therefore clearly establishes the principle that the VAD component of the tariff would be established on the basis of a study realized by a consultant pre-qualified by the CNEE and chosen by the distributor. Once the VAD is so established, the CNEE can calculate and fix the tariffs.\n\n528.\n\nRespondent contends in this respect that *\"the approved law contains no obligation to ensure that the VAD approved is the one determined by the distributor\u2019s study.\"458* The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees.\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7 49.\n\n529.\n\nFirst, it would not make any sense for the regulatory framework to establish a process whereby the distributor is requested to submit a VAD study, the regulator is requested to comment on the same, and a neutral Expert Commission is called to make a pronouncement in case of disagreement, if the regulator had the discretion to disregard the distributor\u2019s study.\n\n530.\n\nSecond, Article 98 RLGE is very clear in that the regulator may only disregard the distributor\u2019s VAD study and apply its own unilateral VAD study in limited circumstances. As a consequence, if such circumstances are not met, the regulator has the obligation to set the VAD on the basis of the distributor\u2019s study.\n\n531.\n\nThis is of course not to say that the distributor\u2019s study is binding upon the regulator. The regulator may disagree on certain parts of the study, in which case the Expert Commission would make a pronouncement which, although not in itself binding, the regulator would in good faith have to consider with care. What Article 98 excludes, however, is the regulator\u2019s discretion to reject without reasons the distributor\u2019s study and - as the case may be - the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements.\n\n532.\n\nSuch principles were obviously of great relevance to any electricity distributor in Guatemala.\n\n533.\n\nIt is relevant in this respect that these principles were considered, in the 1993 study contracted by USAID from the consultants Juan Sebastian Bernstein and Jean Jacques Descazeaux for the benefit of the government of Guatemala at the time of the privatization of the country\u2019s electricity sector, as an important element of the depolitization of the tariff review process: *\"The problem of the likely malfunctioning of a regulatory organism in electricity has been forcefully put forward in Guatemala. This perception is shared by the political, social and economic sectors consulted in the country.*  *In the consultant's judgment, this reinforces the need of having objective rules which define the parties' obligations and rights, thus preventing the arbitrary intervention of regulatory entities* *. It is thought that it would be possible to minimize* *the intervention of a regulatory organism in those matters most sensitive to regulation, such as price regulation in the segments with characteristics of a natural monopoly: transmission and distribution. In this case,*  *a specific intervention might be considered, for example, every 5 or 10 years, by a high level ad-hoc Government entity, for example, a Committee formed by the Ministers of Finance and of Energy and Mines, to supervise a tariff outside study commissioned by the concession holders from a prestigious consulting agency* *. The permanent regulatory function would be limited to overseeing compliance with the law in matters such as safety of facilities (a function that might be assigned to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, for example), even if the arbitration of conflicting aspects might be given to arbitrating courts appointed by the parties.\"459*\n\n*Restructuring the Power Sector in Guatemala: Analysis of Decentralization and Private Participation Mechanisms, Final Report,* by Messrs. Bernstein and Descazeaux (Exhibit C-9), underlined by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n534.\n\nThe question here is whether the regulatory framework permitted the regulator, in the circumstances of the case, to disregard the distributor\u2019s study and to apply its own. The Parties are in disagreement in this regard.\n\n535.\n\nIt is undisputed that EEGSA did not fail to deliver its VAD study. Such study was in fact commissioned from Bates White and delivered to the CNEE for the first time in March 2OO8460, i.e. within the three months\u2019 time-limit provided by Article 98 of the RLGE, second paragraph. Guatemala has not submitted that EEGSA would not have timely delivered its VAD study.\n\nAppendix to Statement RWS-1.\n\n536.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s argument is rather that EEGSA failed to correct its study.\n\n537.\n\nThe Parties however have opposing views as to the circumstances in which the distributor should be considered as having failed to correct its study pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE.\n\n538.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Claimant submits that only those corrections upon which no disagreement existed, or those which, in case of disagreement, had been approved by the Expert Commission, had to be implemented.461\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a770.\n\n539.\n\nIn contrast, Guatemala\u2019s position is that, pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, and because the Expert Commission\u2019s conclusions have no binding effect, the distributor was obliged to implement *all* the CNEE\u2019s observations, regardless of whether a disagreement existed.462\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 207.\n\n540.\n\nIt should be noted, at this juncture, that whether there was a failure by EEGSA to correct its study has not been decided as a matter of Guatemalan law by the Constitutional Court.\n\n541.\n\nAlthough the Constitutional Court refers, in page 14 of its 24 February 2010 decision463, to the fact that the CNEE *\"realized\"* that EEGSA had incurred into an *\"omission\",* and consequently decided to fix the tariff on the basis of its own independent study, neither EEGSA or the CNEE ever requested the Constitutional Court to decide whether such an *\"omission\"* existed pursuant to Article 98 RLGE.464 The mention, in the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision, of an *\"omission\"* on the part of EEGSA to implement the corrections, therefore appears to be no more than a factual reference to the CNEE\u2019s submissions.\n\nExhibit C-345.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n542.\n\nLikewise, when the Constitutional Court decided that the CNEE was entitled to apply a tariff calculated on the basis of the VAD established by its own independent study465, it only did so on the basis that, in Guatemalan law, an expert report cannot be binding and that the law reserves for the regulator the exclusive power to set the tariffs.466\n\nExhibit C-331.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n543.\n\nThe Constitutional Court did therefore not opine on whether, pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, EEGSA indeed failed to correct its VAD report.\n\n544.\n\nAs confirmed by Guatemala\u2019s own submissions in the arbitration: *\"the Constitutional Court did not rely on the amended RLGE Article 98 to establish the lawfulness of the CNEE\u2019s conduct.\"467* Guatemala further submits that Article 98 *\"does not form the basis for the Court\u2019s decision\"468* and *\"had no influence on the Court\u2019s decision.\"469*\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a762.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 64.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 66.\n\n545.\n\nNor did the Constitutional Court, as will be seen in further sections of this award, decide whether, despite the Expert Commission\u2019s report not being binding, the CNEE nonetheless had the duty to consider it and provide reasons for its decision to disregard it. Such question will thus have to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n546.\n\nWhether the CNEE was entitled, pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, to apply a tariff based on its own independent VAD study raises the fundamental question of the role of the Expert Commission. Such question will now be addressed.\n\n**c) The role of the Expert Commission**\n----------------------------------------\n\n547.\n\nIn brief, the Claimant avers that the Expert Commission\u2019s determinations were binding and that the CNEE was therefore obliged to follow its conclusions.470\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 43,213 *et seq.*\n\n548.\n\nIt follows from that position that, by refusing to implement those of the CNEE\u2019s observations on the Bates White study that were disputed and in respect of which the Expert Commission had not ruled in favor of the CNEE, EEGSA did not fail to correct its study pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE. As a consequence, the CNEE was not entitled to fix the tariff on the basis of its own independent study.471\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 192.\n\n549.\n\nThe Respondent avers, to the contrary, that the Expert Commission\u2019s role was merely advisory and that its conclusions were therefore not binding upon the CNEE.472\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 502.\n\n550.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that, according to the regulatory framework, the CNEE retains the exclusive power to fix the tariffs, and that EEGSA consequently had the obligation to implement all its observations. According to the Respondent, the Expert Commission\u2019s role was limited to verifying that EEGSA had done so.\n\n551.\n\nThe Respondent submits accordingly that: *\"given the consultant\u2019s obligation under the regulatory framework to \"incorporate\" the corrections required by the CNEE such that the study would comply with the Terms of Reference (REGE Article 98), the only discrepancies that could remain for consideration by the Expert Commission are: (i) whether the distributor made the corrections; or (ii) whether the corrections were properly implemented.\"473*\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 380, see also Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 207.\n\n552.\n\nThis position is consistent with the position taken by the CNEE in its Resolution No. 144-2008 of July 29, 2008, whereby the CNEE considered, in order to approve the tariff based on its own independent study, that *\"according to what is set forth in current legislation, the National Electric Energy Commission, through Resolution CNEE-96-2008, recorded the discrepancies with the Tariff Study in writing and ordered the constitution of the Expert Commission, which remitted its decision on July twenty-five, two thousand eight, and after analyzing the same, it was confirmed that the Tariff Study presented by Empresa El\u00e9ctrica de Guatemala, Sociedad* *An\u00f3nima, through Note GG-060-2008, failed to perform all the corrections pursuant to the observations indicated in Resolution CNEE-63-2008.\"474*\n\nExhibit C-272.\n\n553.\n\nRespondent\u2019s view is therefore that EEGSA had the duty to implement all the corrections requested by the CNEE, and that the Expert Commission\u2019s role was limited to verifying that *\"the corrections were properly implemented.\"475* As a consequence, in refusing to incorporate the corrections upon which there was a disagreement, EEGSA failed to implement the corrections pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE and the CNEE was entitled to fix the tariff on the basis of its own independent study.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n554.\n\nThe Respondent further took the view that the CNEE could reject the Bates White study because *\"EEGSA and Bates White were not cooperative during the tariff review process, which cast doubts on the reliability of the Bates White study\"476,* and because *\"the Expert Commission confirmed that the Bates White study was flawed\u2019* since *\"the database submitted by Bates White was [...] not traceable and interlinked\u2019* and was *\"not accompanied by a supporting database.\"477* As a consequence, because the CNEE could not *\"perform an audit of the model\",* it *\"believed that the regulations not only allowed, but also required it to approve a tariff study that was reliable.\"478*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 513.\n\n*Ibid., \u00a7* 515.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 516.\n\n555.\n\nIn order to assess whether such arguments are correct, it is necessary to perform an analysis of the relevant provisions of the regulatory framework in light of the decisions made by the Constitutional Court.\n\n556.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the LGE and the RLGE in this respect are Article 75 of the LGE and Article 98, third paragraph, of the RLGE.\n\n557.\n\nArticle 75 of the LGE provides in its original Spanish language that: *\"La* [CNEE] *revisar\u00e1 los estudios efectuados y podr\u00e1 formular observaciones a los mismos. En caso de discrepancias formuladas por escrito, la* [CNEE] *y las distribuidoras deber\u00e1n acordar el nombramiento de una Comisi\u00f3n Pericial de tres integrantes, uno nombrado por cada parte y el tercero de com\u00fan acuerdo. La Comisi\u00f3n Pericial se* *pronunciar\u00e1 sobre las discrepancias, en un plazo de 60 d\u00edas contados desde su conformaci\u00f3n. \"479*\n\nEnglish translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17): *\"The Commission* [CNEE] *shall review the studies performed and may make comments on the same. In case of differences made in writing, the Commission* [CNEE] *and the distributors shall agree on the appointment of an Expert Commission made of three members, one appointed by each party and the third by mutual agreement. The Expert Commission shall rule on the differences in a period of 60 days counted from its appointment\".*\n\n558.\n\nThe dispute arises in large part from a difference on the exact meaning of the Spanish term *\"se pronunciar\u00e1\"* in the final sentence of Article 75. According to the Claimant, this term means that the Expert Commission had the powers of an adjudicator.480 As a consequence, the CNEE had the obligation to base the tariff on the Bates White study as amended in accordance with the determinations of the Expert Commission. According to the Respondent, this term means that the Expert Commission had to express a non-binding view, with the consequence that the CNEE had no obligation to defer to its conclusions.481\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7213 *et seq.*\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 142 *et seq.*\n\n559.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the Constitutional Court made it very clear, in its decisions of November 18, 2009 and February 24, 2010, that the report of the Expert Commission would only have an *\"illustrative or informative\"* value, and that the Commission had no power to determine in a binding manner a dispute between the CNEE and EEGSA.482\n\nExhibit C-331, p. 14 (English version) and Exhibit C-345, pp. 16-17 (English version).\n\n560.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that this is a point of interpretation of Article 75 of the LGE that is submitted to Guatemalan law, and in respect of which it is proper to defer to the decision made by the Constitutional Court.\n\n561.\n\nThis being said, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the Constitutional Court was not called to decide whether, in spite of the Expert Commission\u2019s report having an *\"informative\"* value, the CNEE nevertheless had the obligation, under the regulatory framework, to give it serious consideration when establishing the tariff, or to give reasons for a decision to depart from it.\n\n562.\n\nObviously, the Constitutional Court cannot have intended to say that the CNEE could arbitrarily and without reasons disregard the Expert Commission\u2019s recommendations. In fact, at no point in either of its two decisions does the Constitutional Court say that fixing the tariff would be an entirely discretionary exercise on the part of the regulator. And such a conclusion would, for the reasons that will be explained below, be manifestly at odds with the regulatory framework.\n\n563.\n\nIt is clear that the regulator did not enjoy unlimited discretion in fixing the tariff. The entire regulatory framework is based on the premise that it would not be so. In this respect, the Constitutional Court noted in its decision of November 18, 2009 that it had not been called to assess the *\"rationality\"* of the adopted tariff483 Such term can be understood both with respect to the content of the tariff and with the process leading to its establishment.\n\nExhibit C-331, p. 20 (English version).\n\n564.\n\nWhat the Constitutional Court intended to say is clearly that, because the CNEE retains the exclusive power to fix the tariff, such power could not be delegated in all or part to the Expert Commission. This does not mean, however, that the Expert Commission\u2019s report should not have been given serious consideration by the CNEE. It does not mean, either, that the CNEE had unlimited discretion to depart from it without valid reasons. In addition, the role of the Expert Commission was limited to the determination of the VAD, which is only an element of the tariff.\n\n565.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that, although the conclusions of the Expert Commission were not binding in the sense that it had no adjudicatory powers, the CNEE nevertheless had the duty, under the regulatory framework, to give them serious consideration and to provide valid reasons in case it decided to depart from them.\n\n566.\n\nThis view is confirmed, as will be seen thereafter, by the considerable importance given to the Expert Commission in the LGE and in the RLGE, as well as in the behavior of the regulator and the distributor in the tariff review process.\n\n567.\n\nAs an initial matter, the language used in Article 75 of the LGE clearly suggests that, in case of a disagreement between the CNEE and the distributor on the distributor\u2019s VAD report, such disagreement would be resolved on the basis of a determination made by the Expert Commission.\n\n568.\n\nIf the Expert Commission\u2019s role had only been, as Respondent suggests, to make sure that the observations made by the CNEE had been fully implemented by the distributor, this sentence would make no sense whatsoever. It is clear in Article 75 of the LGE that the Expert Commission\u2019s role was to provide a solution to disagreements between the CNEE and the distributor, not to act as the guardian of the regulator\u2019s views.\n\n569.\n\nLikewise, if the Expert Commission\u2019s role was only that of an expert to the CNEE, there would have been no need whatsoever for a rule such as Article 75 of the LGE. According to Article 5 of the LGE, the CNEE could at any time contract experts as it saw fit.484 It is clear that the intervention of the Expert Commission was provided for the benefit of both parties, in the context of a bilateral cooperative process.\n\nLGE, art. 5, penultimate paragraph: *\"The Commission may request professional counsel, consulting and experts that it requires for its functions\",* English translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-17).\n\n570.\n\nThe bilateral nature of expertise proceedings is confirmed by the language used in Article 98 of the RLGE, which provides that the fees of the third member of the Expert Commission are paid in equal shares by the CNEE and the distributor.\n\n571.\n\nOf even more relevance to the Arbitral Tribunal is the fact that the LGE intended the Expert Commission to be a neutral body. Article 75 of the LGE provides, to that effect, that the Expert Commission would be composed of three members, one appointed by each party and the third one by agreement of the parties.\n\n572.\n\nThis constitution mechanism, similar to that of an arbitral tribunal, shows that the LGE intended to make sure that the Expert Commission, in pronouncing itself on the parties\u2019 differences, would act in a neutral manner.\n\n573.\n\nThe facts of the case show that the parties have devoted a considerable amount of care to the manner in which the Expert Commission would be constituted in order to make sure that it would act in a neutral manner. For example, the parties verified the absence of conflicts of interest of its members, which is exactly what would have been done for an adjudicating body.485\n\nPrior to agreeing with the CNEE that Carlos Bastos would be the president of the Expert Commission, EEGSA \"revealed\" to the CNEE that Mr. Bastos had in the past advised EEGSA in an unrelated matter, as well as the fees that EEGSA had paid in this occasion to Mr. Bastos.\n\n574.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal draws two conclusions from such facts.\n\n575.\n\nThe first is that, contrary to Respondent\u2019s contention, the role of the Expert Commission was not limited to verifying that all the CNEE\u2019s observations were implemented in the distributor\u2019s VAD study. The Expert Commission was not the guardian of the interest of the CNEE, but a neutral body whose task was to provide, in a non-binding manner, solutions to the disputes between the parties.\n\n576.\n\nThe second is that the conclusions of the Expert Commission were meant to have a greater authoritative value than those of a consultant that the regulator could have contracted for its own benefit. If the regulator had the discretion to disregard the Expert Commission\u2019s conclusions without providing any reasons, the regulatory framework would make no sense.\n\n577.\n\nIt follows that the distributor could not have the obligation to implement corrections to its VAD report upon which a disagreement had properly been submitted to the Expert Commission.\n\n578.\n\nBecause the Expert Commission\u2019s role was to permit the resolution of disputes between the parties, it makes perfect sense to construe Article 98 of the RLGE, third paragraph, as subjecting the distributor\u2019s obligation to make the corrections requested by the CNEE to the pronouncement of the Expert Commission in case of disagreement.\n\n579.\n\nIt would in fact be entirely nonsensical for the regulatory framework to provide that, in case of a disagreement between the CNEE and the distributor on the distributor\u2019s VAD study, a neutral Expert Commission would be constituted to pronounce itself (Article 75 of the LGE), and at the same time to oblige the distributor to immediately incorporate any such point of disagreement in its VAD study.\n\n580.\n\nIt would be even more nonsensical to allow the regulator to unilaterally impose its own VAD study because observations upon which there were disagreements and that were subject to a pending pronouncement of the Expert Commission had not been immediately incorporated in the VAD study.\n\n581.\n\nThe regulatory framework clearly provides otherwise. Pursuant to Article 75 of the LGE and Article 98 of the RLGE, once the distributor has submitted its VAD study, the CNEE makes its observations and, unless there is a disagreement properly submitted to the Expert Commission, the distributor has to correct the study accordingly. In case of a disagreement referred to the Expert Commission, however, the distributor has no obligation to immediately correct its VAD study until the Expert Commission has pronounced itself. Article 98 of the RLGE, third paragraph, provides to that effect that, once the regulator has made its observations *\"if discrepancies between the Commission and the distributor persist, the procedure stipulated in Article 75 of the Law shall be followed\u2019.*\n\n582.\n\nThe regulatory framework is less clear as to the deference that the CNEE had to give to the Expert Commission\u2019s report. As said above, although the Expert Commission had no adjudicatory powers and although its report was, in the words of the Constitutional Court, technically *\"informative\"*, the importance given to the Expert Commission in the LGE and the RLGE, as well as the behavior of the parties to the tariff review process, show that the distributor was entitled to expect that the Commission\u2019s conclusions be seriously considered and taken into account by the regulator in fixing the VAD.\n\n583.\n\nIn view of the Arbitral Tribunal, the regulator could not decide to disregard the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements without providing any reason. The obligation to provide reasons derives from both the regulatory framework and from the international obligations of the State under the minimum standard.\n\n584.\n\nUnder the regulatory framework, it would be entirely inconsistent to provide for an expert determination mechanism while at the same time allowing the regulator to disregard the Expert Commission\u2019s conclusions without any reasons. Admitting that the regulator could ignore the Expert Commission\u2019s conclusions without providing any reason would be tantamount to assimilating the Expert Commission to a consultant contracted by the regulator in its own interest, which is clearly not what was intended by the LGE and the RLGE.\n\n585.\n\nFirst, the Parties would not have devoted so much care and attention to the expert determination process if the regulator had the right to entirely ignore the conclusions of the Expert Commission without providing reasons. Second, as said in earlier sections of this award, the Expert Commission was a neutral body, which was established by the regulatory framework in the interest of both parties.\n\n586.\n\nIn addition, the obligation for the regulator to provide reasons derives from the regulatory framework itself. Article 75 of the LGE and Article 98 of the RLGE oblige the regulator to provide its observations on the distributor\u2019s VAD study in writing. The distributor would otherwise be unable to explain why there is a disagreement on such observations and to refer such disagreement to the Expert Commission. It is in this respect undisputed that the observations made by the CNEE on Bates White\u2019s VAD study were indeed made in writing and carefully reasoned.486 There is no reason not to apply the same principle to the regulator\u2019s decision to depart from the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements.\n\nSee the CNEE\u2019s observations of April 11, 2008 (Exhibit C-193), and Resolution No. 96-2008 of May 16, 2008, establishing the discrepancies (Exhibit C-209).\n\n587.\n\nUnder the minimum standard, international law prohibits State officials from exercising their authority in an abusive, arbitrary or discriminatory manner. Article 10.5 CAFTA-DR also obliges the State to observe due process in administrative proceedings. A lack of reasons may be relevant to assess whether a given decision was arbitrary and whether there was lack of due process in administrative proceedings. As renowned authors have put it: *\"if State officials can demonstrate that the decision was actually made in an objective and rational (i.e. reasoned) manner, they wdl defeat any claim made under the standard. If they cannot, the arbitrary conduct must be remedied.\"487* It is particularly so in the context of a tariff review process that is based on the parties\u2019 good faith cooperation, and in the context of which the parties had contemplated the intervention of a neutral body to resolve differences.\n\nGrierson-Weiler and Laird referring to the ***Saluka*** Award, supra footnote 216, in \"Standards of Treatment\", ***The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law,*** Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 284-285.\n\n588.\n\nIn sum, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that, although the conclusions of the Expert Commission were not technically binding upon the CNEE, the CNEE had the duty to seriously consider them and to provide its reasons in case it would decide to disregard them.\n\n589.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal also concludes that, pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, the distributor was under no obligation to incorporate in its VAD study observations made by the CNEE in respect of which there was a disagreement properly submitted to the Expert Commission. Unless the regulator provided valid reasons to the contrary, it is only if and when the Expert Commission had pronounced itself in favor of the regulator that such an obligation would arise.\n\n**d) Whether the distributor\u2019s consultant and the Expert Commission could depart from the Terms of Reference**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n590.\n\nAnother point of disagreement between the Parties is whether the distributor\u2019s consultant and the Expert Commission could depart from the Terms of Reference.\n\n591.\n\nPursuant to Article of the 74 LGE, second paragraph, the CNEE had to establish terms of reference for each distributor\u2019s VAD study. Accordingly, in January 2008, the CNEE established Terms of Reference to be followed by Bates White in the making of its VAD study.\n\n592.\n\nThe Parties are essentially in disagreement on one important provision of the ToR, namely Article 1.10, which provides that *\"These ToR set forth the guidelines to follow in preparation of the Study, and for each one of its Stages and/or described* *and defined studies. If there are changes in the methodologies set forth in the Study Reports, which must be fully justified, the CNEE shall make such observations regarding the changes as it deems necessary, confirming that they are consistent with the guidelines for the Study. These terms of reference do not constitute a legal or regulatory modification, and therefore, in case of a controversy between one of the provisions of these terms of reference and the Law or the Regulations, the provisions of the latter shall prevail, in all cases applying the principle of legal hierarchy. In addition, any omission of these terms of reference, relative to aspects defined in the Law and the Regulations for tariff matters, shall be understood to be incorporated into the TOR\".488*\n\nExhibit C-417, English translation provided by the Claimant.\n\n593.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Article 1.10 permitted the distributor\u2019s consultant to depart from the Terms of Reference in order to ensure that the VAD study would comport with the regulatory framework.489\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7 122.\n\n594.\n\nThe Respondent, to the contrary, contends that Article 1.10 had a restricted scope and that only those changes that would be consistent with the Terms of Reference themselves could be introduced.490\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7 89.\n\n595.\n\nAs the Arbitral Tribunal sees it, Article 1.10 of the Terms of Reference establishes two clear principles.\n\n596.\n\nThe first is that the Terms of Reference are *\"guidelines\" Alineamientos\"* in the original Spanish version), which term suggests a certain degree of generality and flexibility.491 In the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, such term would not have been used if the drafters of the Terms of Reference had not intended to preserve a certain degree of flexibility in its application by the distributor\u2019s consultant and the Expert Commission.\n\n*Lineamientos* are guidelines, general criterion.\n\n597.\n\nGuatemala avers, in this respect, that the Terms of Reference were *\"mandatory\"492* The Tribunal understands this submission in the sense that the Terms of Reference were binding upon the distributor and the Expert Commission. The Arbitral Tribunal can however only note that such term is not to be found in Article 1.10, and does not exist in the LGE and the RLGE.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 316(a).\n\n598.\n\nArticle 1.10, a provision that was intensely negotiated with the distributor493, was precisely designed to define the extent to which the Terms of Reference would be binding, and it is against the provisions of Article 1.10 that the binding effect of the Terms of Reference needs to be assessed.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 107; Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 315.\n\n599.\n\nThe second principle established in Article 1.10 is that the possibility of variations was admitted. Article 1.10, first paragraph, provides the possibility of *\"changes in the methodologies set forth in the Study Reports\",* which must then be *\"fully justified\u2019.* Such changes are changes to the methodologies proposed in the Terms of Reference.\n\n600.\n\nThe last part of the first paragraph of Article 1.10 also provides that any such change needs to be consistent with *\"the guidelines for the study\".* The meaning of this last sentence is unclear and has been discussed at length at the hearing.\n\n601.\n\nAccording to the testimony of the president of the CNEE, Carlos Colom Bickford, who was president of the CNEE at the time of the facts, the terms *\"guidelines for the study\"* at the end of the first paragraph of Article 1.10 are a reference to the Terms of Reference themselves.494 However, it seems rather circular to say that the Terms of Rerference are *\"guidelines\"* and that any variation from such guidelines needs to be consistent with the guidelines themselves.\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 1148, \u00a7 12- p. 1150, \u00a7 8.\n\n602.\n\nMr Giacchino from Bates White, and a former member of the Expert Commission, testified that the terms *\"guidelines for the study\"* referred to the regulatory framework.495\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 845, \u00a7 15 -p. 847, \u00a7 17.\n\n603.\n\nThis matter has been specifically discussed by the Expert Commission in its report. The Expert Commission considered that *\"the duly justified deviations allowed by the Terms of Reference must lead to an application of a methodology in the tariff study that best reflects the requirements of the LGE and the RLGE\u2019496*\n\nExpert Commission\u2019s Report, p. 14, English version (Exhibit R-87).\n\n604.\n\nThe Expert Commission thus opined that Article 1.10 permitted the distributor\u2019s consultant, under the control of the Expert Commission, to depart from the Terms of Reference in order to ensure that the VAD study would comport with the regulatory framework.\n\n605.\n\nAs it is known, the CNEE did not, when it received the report, specifically object to such finding. It is only in the context of this arbitration that the Respondent developed an argument to the contrary.\n\n606.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal sees no reason to revisit the Expert Commission\u2019s finding in this respect. In fact, the Expert Commission\u2019s interpretation of Article 1.10 seems entirely reasonable: if the Terms of Reference were guidelines that could - according to its own terms - be varied, it is perfectly acceptable to consider that such variations had to be consistent with the principles set forth in the LGE and the RLGE.\n\n607.\n\nSuch finding of the Arbitral Tribunal is confirmed by the language of Article 1.10, second paragraph. Article 1.10, second paragraph, clearly establishes the principle that *\"in case of a controversy between one of the provisions of these terms of reference and the Law or the Regulations, the provisions of the latter shall prevail, in all cases applying the principle of legal hierarchy.\"*\n\n608.\n\nGuatemala objects that, in case of a divergence between the Terms of Reference and the regulatory framework, the only recourse open to the distributor was a judicial challenge against the Terms of Reference.497 The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees.\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a784.\n\n609.\n\nArticle 1.10 was designed precisely to allow the distributor\u2019s consultant, under the control of the Expert Commission, to depart from the Terms of Reference in case the Terms of Reference would not comport with the regulatory framework, thus avoiding the delays and complications of a judicial challenge.\n\n610.\n\nThis is of course not to say that the distributor or the Expert Commission had unfettered discretion to amend the Terms of Reference as they saw fit. Article 1.10 provides that any variation must be *\"fully justified\u2019* and be consistent with the regulatory framework.\n\n2. The alleged representations of the Respondent and Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations at the time of the investment\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nTECO avers that Guatemala made specific representations that induced the Claimant to invest in the country\u2019s electricity sector498, and then frustrated the legitimate expectations arising therefrom.499\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a760.\n\n*Ibid.* ***,*** \u00a7 62.\n\n612.\n\nThe representations allegedly made by the Respondent were (i) that the VAD would be calculated on the new replacement value of an efficient company asset base500, (ii) that EEGSA\u2019s consultant would calculate the VAD501, and (iii) that disputes concerning the same would be resolved by an Expert Commission.502\n\nIbid., \u00a7\u00a763 *et seq.*\n\nIbid., \u00a7\u00a770 *et seq.*\n\nIbid., \u00a7\u00a770 *et seq.*\n\n613.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s arguments regarding the existence of representations made by Guatemala are essentially based on certain statements made in occasion of a presentation made by Guatemala in preparation for the privatization503, as well as in the Memorandum of Sale prepared at the time by Salomon Smith Barney as EEGSA\u2019s financial consultant.504\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 55; Claimant PHB, \u00a7 61; Exhibit C-28.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 52 *et seq.;* Claimant PHB, \u00a7 61: Exhibit C-29.\n\n614.\n\nPage 19 of the presentation states that *\"any material change in tariff methodology must be supported by a study conducted by an internationally recognized independent consultant.\"505* As for the Memorandum of Sale, it is more specific and states, in the relevant parts relating to the regulatory framework, that *\"VADs must be calculated by distributors by means of a study commissioned from an engineering firm, but the Commission may dictate that the studies be grouped by density. The Commission will review those studies and can make observations, but in the event of discrepancy, a Commission of three experts will be convened to resolve the differences.\"506*\n\nExhibit C-28.\n\nExhibit C-29.\n\n615.\n\nAttached to the Memorandum of Sale was an English-language draft of the future law of electricity, providing in Article 75 that *\"the Commission* [CNEE] *shall review the studies performed and may make comments on the same. In case of differences made in writing, the Commission and the distributors shall agree on the appointment of an Expert Commission made of three members, one appointed by each party and the third by mutual agreement. The Expert Commission shall rule on the differences in a period of 60 days counted from its appointment.\"507*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n616.\n\nThe Respondent objects that any legitimate expectation can only belong to the entity having invested at the time of the privatization of EEGSA, and could not be transferred to the Claimant, who only acquired its shares in EEGSA in 20 05.508 The Respondent also submits that legitimate expectations are not protected under the minimum standard of treatment.509 The Respondent further submits that the presentation and the Memorandum of Sale are in any event general and non-binding documents that could not, at the time, be understood as specific representations made by the State to the investor.510 Respondent finally objects that, in absence of a stabilization clause, the presentation and the Memorandum of Sale could not be understood as a representation that the regulatory framework would not change.511\n\nSee above, \u00a7 7.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 172.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 558-560.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 562 *et seq.*\n\n617.\n\nIn the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, in a regulatory context, a distinction needs to be made between the expectations arising from a specific representation that the legal framework will not change in all or in part, and the general expectation that the legal framework will not be applied arbitrarily.\n\n618.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the presentation and the Memorandum of Sale did not include any specific representation that the regulatory framework would not evolve.\n\n619.\n\nSuch question is in any event irrelevant. As will be seen in further sections of this award512, the State will not be found responsible based on a lack of stability of the regulatory framework. Indeed, the amendments introduced in 2007 to the RLGE did not alter the fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework was based. The basis for the State\u2019s responsibility is rather its repudiation of such fundamental principles and its breach of due process in administrative matters.\n\nSee below, \u00a7 629.\n\n620.\n\nThe legitimate expectations upon which the Claimant relies are rather that the LGE and the RLGE would be applied in a fair and non-arbitrary manner.\n\n621.\n\nIt is clear, in the eyes of the Arbitral Tribunal, that any investor has the expectation that the relevant applicable legal framework will not be disregarded or applied in an arbitrary manner. However, that kind of expectation is irrelevant to the assessment of whether a State should be held liable for the arbitrary conduct of one of its organs.513 What matters is whether the State\u2019s conduct has objectively been arbitrary, not what the investor expected years before the facts. A willful disregard of the law or an arbitrary application of the same by the regulator constitutes a breach of the minimum standard, with no need to resort to the doctrine of legitimate expectations.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submissions of the Republic of El Salvador, \u00a7\u00a7 13-14; the Dominican Republic, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 10; and the Republic of Elonduras, \u00a7\u00a7 9-10.\n\n622.\n\nThere is therefore no need to dwell any further on the Parties\u2019 arguments on representations and legitimate expectations. In particular, there is no need for the Tribunal to deal with the Parties\u2019 arguments as to whether the Claimant is entitled to rely on the alleged expectations of the entity that invested in EEGSA in 1998.\n\n3. The Respondent\u2019s behavior\n----------------------------\n\n623.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Guatemala breached the minimum standard by **(a)** amending to its own advantage article 98 of the RLGE, **(b)** manipulating the Terms of Reference and failing to cooperate in good faith with EEGSA during the tariff review process, **(c)** dissolving the Expert Commission, **(d)** refusing to consider the Expert Commission\u2019s report and fixing the tariff based on its own consultant\u2019s VAD study and **(e)** retaliating against EEGSA.\n\n**a) The amendments to RLGE Article 98**\n----------------------------------------\n\n624.\n\nClaimant first submits that Guatemala, in breach of its international obligations, amended Article 98 the RLGE to permit, in certain circumstances, the tariff to be fixed on the basis of the regulator\u2019s independent study rather than on the distributor\u2019s study.514\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 84; Reply, \u00a7 91.\n\n625.\n\nIn the RLGE as adopted in 1997, Article 98 provided that, in the event that the distributor did not submit its study or the corrections requested by the regulator, the previous tariff would remain in force on a provisional basis. Article 98, as amended in 2007, provides that, in the same circumstances, the CNEE is entitled to publish the tariff on the basis of its own independent study.\n\n626.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that Claimant\u2019s claims are time barred insofar as they are based on such purportedly illegal amendment of Article 98.\n\n627.\n\nArticle 10.18.1 of the CAFTA-DR provides that \"[no] *claim may be submitted to arbitration pursuant to this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged [...].\"*\n\n628.\n\nIn the case at hand, the amendment in dispute was published in the *Diario de Centro-America* in March 2007515. As a consequence, the Claimant should have been aware of the amendment at that date or shortly thereafter. A claim that the Respondent, by adopting the amendment, breached its obligations under the treaty was therefore time-barred as from March 2010. As the Arbitral Tribunal sees it, and contrary to Claimant\u2019s submission516, this is not a matter of jurisdiction but of admissibility. It is thus irrelevant that the Respondent517 failed to raise, in its Memorial of Jurisdiction and Admissibility, a jurisdictional objection in this respect.\n\nExhibit C-105.\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7 116.\n\nThe Claimant refers erroneously to \"the Claimant\" rather than to \"the Respondent\" in the last sentence of \u00a7 116 of its Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n629.\n\nAt any rate, this argument is ill-grounded. As rightly pointed out by the Respondent, Guatemala never agreed or represented that the regulatory framework would remain unchanged. In absence of a stabilization clause, it is perfectly acceptable that the State amends the relevant laws and regulations as appropriate.518 It is only if a change to the regulatory framework is made in bad faith or with the intent to deprive the investor of the benefits of its investment that it could entail the State\u2019s international responsibility.\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, October 31, 2011, \u00a7 364; *Mobil Investments Canada Inc. and Murphy Oil Corporation v. Canada,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/04, Decision on Liability, May 22, 2012, \u00a7 153.\n\n630.\n\nIn the case at hand, the Arbitral Tribunal does not find the amendment to Article 98 RLGE to be unfair or arbitrary. If properly interpreted, Article 98 of the RLGE as amended does not give unfettered discretion to the regulator to apply its own independent study. In fact, as explained in earlier sections of this award519, the amendment only permits the tariff to be based on the regulator\u2019s own study in two limited circumstances.\n\nSee above \u00a7\u00a7 524-526.\n\n631.\n\nThe first is when the distributor entirely fails to submit its study. In such a case, it is entirely understandable that the regulator would not be willing to freeze the previous tariff.\n\n632.\n\nThe second is when the distributor fails to implement the corrections requested by the regulator. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that, as interpreted by Guatemala (i.e. that a failure by the distributor to apply changes upon which there is a disagreement submitted to the Expert Commission allows the regulator to immediately fix the tariff on the basis of its own study) would lead to the absurd result of rendering the expert determination procedure meaningless and to grant to the regulator unfettered discretion to fix the tariff. However, the Arbitral Tribunal has determined that such is not the meaning of RLGE Article 98 as amended.520\n\nSee above, \u00a7\u00a7 547-589.\n\n633.\n\nRLGE Article 98 as amended, in referring to a distributor\u2019s failure to correct the VAD study, obviously applies to those corrections that are not in dispute, or in respect of which the Expert Commission found in favor of the regulator (or in respect of which the regulator would, after due consideration, have in good faith expressed reasons to disregard the report of the Expert Commission). The Arbitral Tribunal does not find it objectionable that, should the distributor fail to incorporate the corrections in such a situation, the regulator could decide to use its own independent study.\n\n634.\n\nIn assessing whether the 2007 amendment to article 98 is open to criticism, the Arbitral Tribunal also finds it relevant that the Claimant did not at the time object to the amendment, either by way of an informal complaint or by way of a *recurso de amparo.*\n\n635.\n\nThe second argument made by the Claimant regarding the alleged abuse of the State\u2019s power relates to the introduction in the RLGE, on May 19, 2008, of an Article 98bis pursuant to which, in case of disagreement between the regulator and the distributor, the third member of the Expert Commission would be appointed by the Ministry of Energy.521\n\nGovernment Resolution No. 145-2008 (Exhibit C-212).\n\n636.\n\nIt is however undisputed that Article 98bis of the RLGE did not apply to the 2008-2013 tariff due to the principle of non-retroactivity in Guatemalan law.\n\n637.\n\nIn the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, because the Claimant sold its interest in EGGSA in October 2010 and did not therefore participate in the 2013-2018 tariff review process, it has no interest to claim damages as a consequence of the potentially harmful consequences of that change.\n\n638.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the arbitral Tribunal rejects Claimant\u2019s arguments related to the abuse of the State\u2019s powers with respect to the amendments to article 98 of the RLGE.\n\n**b) The alleged manipulations of the Terms of Reference by the CNEE and the alleged lack of cooperation of the CNEE in the tariff review process**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n639.\n\nThe Claimant makes a series of allegations according to which the CNEE (i): attempted to include in the Terms of Reference a new Article 1.9 granting it unlimited discretion to declare EEGSA\u2019s VAD study as not received522, (ii) inserted in the Terms of Reference an FRC formula that was inconsistent with the regulatory framework523, (iii) failed to cooperate in good faith to the tariff review process524 and (iv) tried to unduly influence the Expert Commission.525\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7\u00a7118 ***et seq.***\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 130 *et seq.*\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 136-138.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 148 *et seq.*\n\n640.\n\nAs to the argument relating to the attempt by the CNEE to include a new Article 1.9 in the Terms of Reference, it is undisputed that the CNEE agreed to replace the proposed new Article 1.9 with the current Article 1.8 of the Terms of Reference, which has not been objected by the Claimant.526 As a consequence, Claimant\u2019s Article 1.9 argument is irrelevant.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 119.\n\n641.\n\nThe Claimant makes a series of other allegations according to which the Terms of Reference *\"contained provisions that predetermine the results of the VAD study, in violation of LGE Article 74.\"527* However, the Claimant also submits that, as a consequence of the introduction of such provisions, the Parties agreed on Article 1.10 of the Terms of Reference as a safeguard, and EEGSA withdrew its *amparo528* As a consequence, such allegations are also irrelevant.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 120.\n\n*Ibid.,\u00a7* 121.\n\n642.\n\nAs to Claimant\u2019s allegation that the Respondent acted in a *\"manifestly arbitrary manner by adding an FRC formula to EEGSA \u2019s 2008-2013 Terms of Rerference that was inconsistent with the regulatory framework\"529,* it is inconsistent with Claimant\u2019s position that the regulator accepted to introduce flexibility in Article 1.10 through the concept of guidelines and by opening the door to variations in order to ensure that the Terms of Reference would effectively comport with the regulatory framework.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 130.\n\n643.\n\nIf the regulator accepted (as the Arbitral Tribunal found in earlier sections of this award) that the distributor\u2019s VAD study could depart from the Terms of Reference on points where the Terms of Reference would not be consistent with the regulatory framework, the introduction in the Terms of Reference of an FRC formula which was allegedly at odds with the law could not have caused any harm because such discrepancy could in any event have been corrected by the distributor\u2019s consultant itself under the control of the Expert Commission.\n\n644.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that, in the course of the tariff review process, *\"the CNEE refused to hold any meaningful discussions with EEGSA and Bates White regarding EEGSA \u2019s VAD study, despite EEGSA \u2019s repeated requests.\"530* The Arbitral Tribunal does not find support in the record for such a submission. Quite to the contrary, the facts show that the regulator had continuous and intensive contacts with the distributor. In addition, such an allegation, if proved, would not materialize a breach of the State\u2019s obligations under the minimum standard in international law.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 136.\n\n645.\n\nThe Claimant finally submits that the CNEE attempted to manipulate the tariff review process and to unduly influence the Expert Commission.\n\n646.\n\nThe Claimant submits, first of all, that the CNEE abused its powers in the context of the establishment of the Expert Commission\u2019s Operating Rules by unduly trying to introduce a provision stating that the Expert Commission\u2019s report would not be binding upon the CNEE.531\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 142.\n\n647.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that neither the LGE nor the RLGE make any reference to the establishment of Operating Rules for the Expert Commission. As a consequence, although the regulator and the distributor attempted to establish such Operating Rules, there was no obligation on the part of the regulator to bring such discussions to a positive conclusion.\n\n648.\n\nThe Parties are in disagreement as to whether the regulator and the distributor ultimately agreed on Operating Rules for the Expert Commission. Claimant relies on Mr Colom\u2019s - the former president of the CNEE and a witness presented by Guatemala - testimony to aver that there was such an agreement on the Operating Rules, which Guatemala arbitrarily disavowed.532 To the contrary, Guatemala submits that, although there was an informal agreement on parts of the Operating Rules, a formal decision to adopt a full set of Operating Rules for the Expert Commission should have been made in writing and in compliance with the forms required by Guatemalan administrative law.533\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 145; Transcript, Day 5, p. 1120, \u00a7\u00a7 3-18.\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7 170.\n\n649.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal finds no evidence in the record that Operating Rules were ever agreed between the regulator and the distributor. The only basis for the Claimant\u2019s averment that such an agreement existed is exhibit C-218, consisting of an e-mail from Mr. Calleja of EEGSA to Mr. Giacchino, forwarding draft Operating Rules and stating that they had been approved. However, Mr. Calleja\u2019s mail was not copied to the CNEE and there is no evidence in the record that the CNEE ever agreed to what Mr. Calleja understood to be the final Operating Rules.\n\n650.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore rejects the Claimant\u2019s arguments that the CNEE arbitrarily disavowed the agreed Operating Rules.\n\n651.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that the CNEE tried to unduly influence the Expert Commission during the tariff review process by having *ex parte* contacts with its appointee, Mr. Riubrugent, while its own appointee, Mr. Giacchino, refrained from any such contacts.534\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7\u00a7 148 ***et*** *seq.*\n\n652.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that, in communicating with Mr. Riubrugent, the regulator acted improperly. The regulator may well have believed, in the absence of Operating Rules and in the absence of a legal framework applying in Guatemalan law to such expert proceedings, that each party could have contact with its own appointee in order to ensure the efficacy of the expert proceedings.\n\n**c) The CNEE\u2019s decision to dissolve the Expert Commission**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n653.\n\nThe CNEE received the Expert Commission\u2019s report on Friday July 25, 2008 at 4:00 pm.535 On Monday July 28, 2008, the CNEE sent to EEGSA its Resolution No. 3121 dissolving the Expert Commission *\"by virtue of having met the purpose of its appointment. \"536*\n\nExhibit R-88.\n\nExhibit C-247.\n\n654.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the CNEE *\"unilaterally dissolved the Expert Commission and threatened its own appointed expert in order to prevent the Expert Commission from reviewing and approving Bates White\u2019s VAD study under rule 12\",* and that by so doing *\"it undermined the very legal and regulatory framework that Guatemala* *had adopted to depoliticize the tariff review process and to encourage foreign investment in its electricity sector.\"537*\n\nReply, \u00a7 158.\n\n655.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal, however, found that the Expert Commission\u2019s Operating Rules, including the proposed rule 12 providing that the Expert Commission would continue to operate after its report to verify its implementation, had not been approved by the CNEE. In addition, there is nothing in the LGE or the RLGE providing or suggesting that the Expert Commission would have the role of verifying whether and how its pronouncements had been incorporated in the VAD study.\n\n656.\n\nThe Claimant avers that, because the Expert Commission *\"is appointed based upon the agreement of both parties, [... ] neither the CNEE nor the Distributor [... ] has the authority to dissolve* [it] *unilaterally.\"538* However, what is relevant in the eyes of the Arbitral Tribunal is that the LGE and the RLGE only provide for the Expert Commission to pronounce itself on differences regarding the distributor\u2019s VAD study and that no provision is made concerning the implementation of its own pronouncements.\n\n***Ibid.,*** \u00a7 167.\n\n657.\n\nAs a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the CNEE was entitled, once its report had been submitted, to dissolve the Expert Commission. Clearly, the CNEE might have taken the view that keeping the Expert Commission alive was appropriate or useful in order to assist it in the implementation of its report. It nevertheless chose not to do so, and such choice does not constitute a manifest abuse of power or an arbitrary decision that would be in breach of the State\u2019s international obligations under the minimum standard of treatment.\n\n**d) The CNEE\u2019s rejection of the Expert Commission\u2019s report and decision to fix the tariff based on its own consultant\u2019s VAD study**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n658.\n\nOn July 29, 2008, the CNEE adopted its Resolution No. 144-2008, whereby it decided to fix the tariff on the basis of the VAD report prepared by its own consultant Sigla.\n\n659.\n\nResolution No. 144-2008 reads in its relevant parts as follows:\n\n*\"That according to the methodology established in the Terms of Reference, in numeral 1.10 it was established that the National Electric Energy Commission was to verify any variations from what was established in such terms, and as* *recorded in the administrative case fde, during the stage of supervising the progress of such studies, and in accordance with article 74 of the General Law of Electricity, the Commission* [CNEE] *issued comments to the Distributor, pointing out that such variations were not justified according to the methodology and guidelines of the study.*\n\n***CONSIDERING:***  \n*That through a note identified as GG-045-2008 dated March thirty-one, two thousand eight, Empresa El\u00e9ctrica de Guatemala, Sociedad An\u00f3nima remitted to this Commission* [CNEE] *the Tariff Study for it to be declared valid according to what was established in article 98 of the Regulations of the General Law of Electricity, and that on April eleven, two thousand eight, the National Electric Energy Commission, through Resolution CNEE-63-2008, declared such study to be invalid, making the corresponding observations, for the study to be corrected by the Distributor through its consulting company, requiring that it conform to the Terms of Reference.*\n\n***CONSIDERING:***  \n*That on May five, two thousand eight, Empresa El\u00e9ctrica de Guatemala, Sociedad An\u00f3nima, through Note GG-060-2008, once again submitted to the National Electric Energy Commission the Tariff Study, failing to correct all of the observations made by the National Electric Energy Commission through said Resolution CNEE-63- 2008, as established by article 98 of the Regulations of the General Law of Electricity.*\n\n***CONSIDERING:***  \n*That according to what is set forth in current legislation, the National Electric Energy Commission, through Resolution CNEE-96-2008, recorded the discrepancies with the Tariff Study in writing and ordered the constitution of the Expert Commission, which remitted its decision on July twenty-five, two thousand eight, and after analyzing same, it was confirmed that the Tariff Study presented by Empresa El\u00e9ctrica de Guatemala, Sociedad An\u00f3nima, through Note GG-060-2008, failed to perform all the corrections pursuant to the observations indicated in Resolution CNEE-63-2008.*\n\n***CONSIDERING:***  \n*That based on article 98 and 99 of the Regulations of the General Law of Electricity, the National Electric Energy Commission, by legal mandate, is* *charged with approving a tariff study that is the basis for the setting of definitive tariffs.*\n\n***THEREFORE:***  \n*The National Electric Energy Commission, based on the above considerations and the cited laws and regulations,*\n\n***RESOLVES:***  \n*I.

This resolution shall go into effect as of the date of its approval.\"539*\n\nEnglish Translation provided by the Claimant (Exhibit C-272).\n\n660.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, EEGSA\u2019s decision *\"to impose its own unreasonably low VAD on EEGSA reflects a willful and deliberate disregard of the legal and regulatory framework\"540*\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7 164.\n\n661.\n\nThe Respondent, to the contrary, avers that under the regulatory framework, and in particular pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, once it had received the Expert Commission\u2019s report, the CNEE could either elect to correct the distributor\u2019s VAD study itself or, if it found such study to be unsatisfactory, to use the report prepared by its own consultant.541\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 451.\n\n662.\n\nStill according to the Respondent, once it received the Expert Commission\u2019s report, the CNEE realized that it would have taken *\"up to five weeks to incorporate certain pronouncements into the study, which made it impossible to correct the study within the available time remaining, furthermore, given that the Bates White model was not \"linked\", it was impossible to incorporate certain changes and carry out a sensibility analysis in an efficient manner\".* In addition *\"Bates White\u2019s refusal to provide* [an auditable study for over seven months] *created doubts about the integrity of the study and of the advisability of amending it.\"542*\n\n*Ibid* ***.,*** \u00a7 452.\n\n663.\n\nThe Respondent also avers that, when it received the corrected Bates White study on July 28, 2008, *\"the Tariff Division concluded a preliminary review and verified that the models were neither supported nor linked and that the database was still a simple excel file without any automation to allow quick verification of the sources of efficient prices within the remaining two days.\"543*\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 453.\n\n664.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent for the reasons that will be explained below. In the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, in adopting Resolution No. 144-2008, in disregarding without providing reasons the Expert Commission\u2019s report, and in unilaterally imposing a tariff based on its own consultant\u2019s VAD calculation, the CNEE acted arbitrarily and in violation of fundamental principles of due process in regulatory matters.\n\n665.\n\nIn so doing, the CNEE in fact repudiated the two fundamental principles upon which the tariff review process regulatory framework is premised: the principle that, save in the limited exceptions provided by the LGE and the RLGE, the tariff would be based on a VAD calculation made by a prequalified consultant appointed by the distributor; and the principle that, in case of a disagreement between the regulator and the distributor, such disagreement would be resolved having regard to the conclusions of a neutral Expert Commission.\n\n666.\n\nAs an initial matter, it is at this juncture necessary to summarize the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s findings regarding the interpretation of the regulatory framework.\n\n667.\n\nFirst, the Arbitral Tribunal found that, pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, the regulator is entitled to fix the tariff on the basis of his own VAD study only in two limited circumstances, i.e. when the distributor fails to submit its study and when the distributor fails to correct its study according to the observations of the regulator.544\n\nSee above, \u00a7\u00a7 524-526.\n\n668.\n\nSecond, the Arbitral Tribunal found that, because the regulatory framework provides that a neutral Expert Commission would pronounce itself on any disagreement regarding the observations of the regulator, RLGE Article 98 only mandates the distributor to implement such observations in respect of which (i) there is no disagreement, or (ii), in case of disagreement, the Expert Commission pronounced itself in favor of the regulator (unless the regulator expresses valid reasons to depart from the experts\u2019 pronouncements).545\n\nSee above, \u00a7 589.\n\n669.\n\nThird, the Arbitral Tribunal found that the role of the Expert Commission was not, as Respondent contends, to verify that all the observations made by the regulator on the VAD study were implemented by the distributor\u2019s consultant. The role of the Expert Commission was rather to pronounce itself on any disagreement regarding such observations546, which implies that the Expert Commission could make findings either in favor or against the regulator.\n\nSee above, \u00a7 574.\n\n670.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal finally found that, although the findings of the Expert Commission are not technically binding in the sense that the Expert Commission has no adjudicatory powers, the regulator had the duty to give them serious consideration and to provide reasons in the case it decided to depart from them.547\n\nSee above, \u00a7 588.\n\n671.\n\nBased on those principles, the Arbitral Tribunal will now assess whether Resolution No. 144-2008 is arbitrary and constitutes a breach of the State\u2019s international obligations under the minimum standard of treatment.\n\n672.\n\nAs an initial matter, it is relevant that the Resolution was not based on the fact that the Expert Commission\u2019s report did not comport with the regulatory framework. It is not based, either, on a failure by Bates White to incorporate in its report the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements on the observations in dispute.\n\n673.\n\nResolution 144-2008 is rather based on the fact that the distributor omitted to implement in its study *\"all of the observations made by the National Electric Energy Commission through [...] Resolution CNEE-63- 2008\".*\n\n674.\n\nResolution 63-2008 is the April 11, 2008 decision whereby the regulator made its observations on the first version of the Bates White VAD study.\n\n675.\n\nAs a consequence, the regulator\u2019s decision to apply its own VAD study was based on the fact that the distributor had failed to incorporate in its report all the observations as made *in April 2008.* Such alleged failure was therefore irrespective of the fact that there was a disagreement on such observations, and that the same had been referred to the Expert Commission.\n\n676.\n\nThe CNEE\u2019s decision is consistent with the Respondent\u2019s position that the role of the Expert Commission was limited to verifying that the distributor\u2019s consultant had implemented all of its observations.\n\n677.\n\nSuch position is however inconsistent with the regulatory framework, as interpreted by the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court made it clear that the Expert Commission had an advisory role, which implies that it had to provide its views in case of disagreement on the CNEE\u2019s observations. Given that the regulatory framework establishes the Expert Commission as a neutral body, it is clear that such views could be in favor or against the regulator.\n\n678.\n\nResolution 144-2008 shows, however, that the CNEE did not consider the report of the Expert Commission as the pronouncement of a neutral panel of experts which it had to take into account in establishing the tariff. The CNEE rather used the expert report to ascertain that some of the observations it had made in April 2008 had not been incorporated in the study, regardless of whether there was a disagreement, and irrespective of the views that had been expressed by the experts on such disagreements. In other words, the CNEE failed without any reasons to take the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements into account.\n\n679.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal also considers that the regulator\u2019s decision to apply its own consultant\u2019s study does not comport with Article 98 of the RLGE.\n\n680.\n\nAs a matter of fact, in order for the regulator\u2019s decision to comport with Article 98, it should have said that the distributor failed to correct its study according to the pronouncements of the Expert Commission, or explained why the regulator decided not to accept the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements.\n\n681.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore concludes that Resolution No. 144-2008 is inconsistent with the regulatory framework. By rejecting the distributor\u2019s study because it had failed to incorporate the *totality* of the observations that the CNEE had made in April 2008, with no regard and no reference to the conclusions of the Expert Commission, the CNEE acted arbitrarily and in breach of the administrative process established for the tariff review.\n\n682.\n\nIn the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, both the regulatory framework and the minimum standard of treatment in international law obliged the CNEE to act in a manner that was consistent with the fundamental principles on the tariff review process in Guatemalan law.\n\n683.\n\nThe CNEE, once it had received the Expert Commission\u2019s report, should have analyzed it and taken its conclusions onboard in establishing a tariff based on the Bates White VAD study, unless it had good reasons to consider that such conclusions were inconsistent with the regulatory framework, in which case it had the obligation to provide valid reasons to that effect. However, no such reasons were provided.\n\n684.\n\nGuatemala avers that incorporating the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements in the Bates White\u2019s study would have taken too much time and would not have been compatible with the need to publish the tariff on August 1, 2008.548\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 452.\n\n685.\n\nHowever, there is nothing in the regulatory framework obliging the CNEE to publish the tariff on the first day of the tariff period. Quite to the contrary, Article 99 of the RLGE provides that the tariff is published once it has been approved and no later than nine months after the beginning of the tariff period. As a consequence, the CNEE had until May 1, 2009 at the latest to publish the new tariff. Meanwhile, according to Article 99, the previous tariff could have remained in force with their adjustment formulas.\n\n686.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, the agreed delivery date for the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncement was set for mid-July 2008, specifically July 18.549 The CNEE subsequently agreed to extend such time limit *\"to the week of 24 July, 2008.\"550* The Expert Commission complied in the extended time limit. The regulator was aware of the complexity of the issues raised and could not ignore that it would take more than a few days to consider the Expert Commission\u2019s conclusions and implement them in the VAD study.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 388.\n\n*Ibid.,\u00a7\u00a7* 388-389.\n\n687.\n\nIn the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, in accepting that the Expert Commission would deliver its report the week of July 24, 2008 (or even by mid July 2008), the CNEE also had to accept that it would not be able to seriously consider the experts\u2019 conclusions, correct the Bates White VAD study accordingly, and publish the tariff by August 1, 2008.\n\n688.\n\nBy accepting to receive the Expert Commission\u2019s report in the week of July 24, 2008, to then disregard it along with the Bates White study on the basis that such date did not leave enough time to publish the tariff by August 1, 2008, the CNEE acted in breach of the fundamental principles of due process as well as in a contradictory and aberrant manner.\n\n689.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that it only conducted a *\"preliminary review\"* of the revised July 28 Bates White\u2019s study and concluded that, because the models were not linked and did not allow *\"quick verifications of the sources of efficient prices\",* it could not be amended *\"within the two remaining days.\"551*\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 453.\n\n690.\n\nIn the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, both under the regulatory framework and under the minimum standard of treatment, the CNEE could and should have taken the time, after careful review of the Expert Commission\u2019s report, to implement its conclusions in the Bates White\u2019s study. The *\"preliminary review\"* that the CNEE performed in less than one day was clearly insufficient to discharge that obligation. The Arbitral Tribunal can find no justification, other than its desire to reject the Bates White study in favor of the more favorable Sigla\u2019s study, for such a behavior.\n\n691.\n\nThe arbitrariness of the regulator\u2019s behavior is evidenced by the result of the *\"preliminary review\"552* that it conducted over the weekend of 26-27 July of the Expert Commission\u2019s report and of its likely consequences on the May 5, 2008 version of the Bates White study.\n\n***Ibid.,*** \u00a7 441. The CNEE refers to both its review of the Expert Commission\u2019s Report (which took place over the 26-27 July week-end) and of the Bates White 28 July study as having been *\"preliniinar\".*\n\n692.\n\nThe outcome of such review has been summarized in a document prepared by the CNEE itself553, where the regulator states its view that, if corrected in accordance with the pronouncements of the Expert Commission, the May 5 Bates Whites study would have led to a VNR of US$621 million (instead of the higher figure of US$1,053 million proposed in the revised Bates Whites study). In the same document, the CNEE mentions that the VNR proposed by Sigla, its own independent consultant, was only US$451 million.554\n\nExhibit C-547.\n\n*Ibid.,* Chart at p. 8.\n\n693.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal draws two conclusions from such fact.\n\n694.\n\nFirst, this preliminary review shows that the CNEE could, had it taken additional time, have corrected the Bates Whites study according to the conclusions of the Expert Commission.\n\n695.\n\nSecond, the regulator knew at the time that correcting the Bates White study would have led to a higher VNR than the one proposed by Sigla.\n\n696.\n\nGuatemala acknowledges that the Sigla report did not reflect the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements. Guatemala submits, in this respect, that the Claimant\u2019s position that the Sigla report was *\"unjustified from a financial and engineering point of view [... ] is based upon a fundamental error, which is to assume* *that the Sigla study had to reflect the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements\".* According to Guatemala *\"the Expert Commission was exclusively established for the purpose of verifying whether Bates White had incorporated the comments made by the CNEE into the tariff study so that it could comply with the Terms of Reference.\"555*\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 465.\n\n697.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal, however, has already explained why Guatemala\u2019s view of the role of the Expert Commission is incorrect.556 The Expert Commission\u2019s role was not to verify that the distributor\u2019s consultant had accepted all the regulator\u2019s comments, but to opine on whether such comments did comport with the regulatory framework in case of disagreement.\n\nSee above, \u00a7\u00a7 575 *et seq.*\n\n698.\n\nAs to Guatemala\u2019s view that the regulator was at liberty to fix the tariff based on a VAD study that did not reflect the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements, it is also incorrect. As a matter of fact, the regulatory framework only permits the CNEE to apply its own unilateral VAD study in two limited circumstances, which did not realize in the present case.557\n\nSee above \u00a7\u00a7 526 *et seq.*\n\n699.\n\nGuatemala also suggests that the difference between the VNR as proposed by Bates White and corrected by the CNEE and its preliminary study of the Expert Commission\u2019s report (US$621 M vs. US$451M) can be explained by the fact that the Expert Commission breached the Terms of Reference, in particular in respect of the FRC. The Arbitral Tribunal disagrees.\n\n700.\n\nFirst of all, if the regulator disagreed with the Expert Commission\u2019s conclusions on the depreciation, it should in good faith have expressed such disagreement in a reasoned manner upon receipt of the Expert Commission\u2019s report.\n\n701.\n\nSecond, the Arbitral Tribunal has determined that the Terms of Reference did allow the Expert Commission to depart from the Terms of Reference if needed to ensure that the VAD report comport with the regulatory framework.558 This is what the Expert Commission did in a reasoned manner in respect of the depreciation559. The Arbitral Tribunal sees no valid reason to revisit the Expert Commission\u2019s views in this regard.\n\nSee above \u00a7\u00a7 606-607.\n\nExpert Commission\u2019s Report (Exhibit C-246), pp. 89 ***et seq.***\n\n702.\n\nIt is all the more so that Mr. Damonte, Guatemala\u2019s own expert in calculating the losses suffered by EEGSA during the tariff period560, as well as the CNEE itself in fixing the tariffs applicable to DEORSA and DEOCSA561, have applied depreciation factors of less than 2, which are thus also not compliant with the formula established in the Terms of Reference. Such facts show, in the Arbitral tribunal\u2019s view, that a depreciation factor of less than 2 cannot be inconsistent with the regulatory framework.562\n\nReport RER-2, \u00a7\u00a7193 ***et seq.***\n\nReport RER-2, \u00a7 192.\n\nMr. Damonte, in his rebuttal expert report (Report RER-5, \u00a7 382), also suggests that the depreciation applied by the Expert Commission would include a ***\"conceptual error\"*** because it would lead to an IRR of 12.3 percent and 12.5 percent for the next 30 and 25 years, i.e. significantly more than the one established by the regulatory framework. However, article 79 LGE provides for an IRR up to 13 percent. In addition, pursuant to article 79 LGE, the consequence of a higher IRR would only be its reduction to the maximum amount permitted.\n\n703.\n\nFinally, Guatemala avers that Bates White\u2019s 28 July study *\"failed to incorporate all the pronouncements issued by the Expert Commission and produced overinflated results.\"563*\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7 192.\n\n704.\n\nAs an initial matter, as said above564, the regulator\u2019s decision to reject the Bates White study and apply the Sigla study was not based on an alleged failure by Bates White to incorporate the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements.\n\nSee above \u00a7\u00a7 672-673.\n\n705.\n\nIn addition, Guatemala\u2019s contentions on such alleged failure is unconvincing. Guatemala avers that the substantial difference between the VNR calculated by Mr. Damonte and the one proposed by Bates White in the 28 July study shows that the latter was overinflated. However, such difference can at least in part be explained by the fact that the 28 July study applied the asset depreciation rate proposed by the Expert Commission (i.e. 8.3 percent), while Mr. Damonte applied a higher rate of 29.6 percent565. Guatemala also avers that the 28 July study failed to incorporate all the international reference prices required by the Expert Commission, and that certain prices were excessive.566 However, as pointed out by the Claimant567, the study contains explanations in this respect, which the Respondent has not established that there were unjustified or unreasonable. The Claimant also established that the 28 July study properly incorporated the Expert Commission\u2019s finding with respect to certain legal fees568.\n\nReport RER-2, Table 11 \"Comparison between the different FRCs and the f factor employed\" (Presentation of Damonte for the Hearings, p. 17).\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 113.\n\nClaimant Reply PHB, \u00a7\u00a7 105,106, and 115.\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7 202: Claimant Reply PHB, \u00a7 107.\n\n706.\n\nFinally, Guatemala avers that *\"more information was needed\"* to correctly assess the 28 July study, which was still not an *\"auditable model\"569* Again, no such complaint was made by the regulator at the time. In addition, as said above570, the regulator could not in good faith expect the consultant to provide a perfect model in the few days remaining before the starting date of the new tariff period. Furthermore, as it appears, the Sigla study also had similar flaws571, which did not prevent the regulator from applying it.\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7 194.\n\nSee above \u00a7\u00a7 686-687.\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7 157.\n\n707.\n\nIn sum, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the CNEE decided to disregard the consultant\u2019s VAD study and apply its own unilateral VAD study when none of the two circumstances permitting such a decision under RLGE Article 98 was present.\n\n708.\n\nThe basis for the regulator\u2019s decision is that the consultant had failed to incorporate all the comments made by it in April 2008. Such basis is manifestly inconsistent with the regulatory framework and amounts to ignoring without reasons the pronouncements of the Expert Commission.\n\n709.\n\nBecause the regulator did not consider the Expert Commission as a neutral advisory body, but rather as the guardian of its own positions, the CNEE did not even consider the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements when fixing the tariff.\n\n710.\n\nIn doing so, the regulator has repudiated the two fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework bases the tariff review process: first that, save in the limited cases provided in Article 98 RLGE, the tariff would be based on the VAD study prepared by the distributor\u2019s consultant; and, second, that any disagreement between the regulator and the distributor regarding such VAD study would be resolved by having regard to the pronouncements of a neutral Expert Commission.\n\n711.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal finds that such repudiation of the two fundamental regulatory principles applying to the tariff review process is arbitrary and breaches elementary standards of due process in administrative matters. Such behavior therefore breaches Guatemala\u2019s obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment under article 10.5 of CAFTA-DR. As shall be seen in subsequent sections of this award, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that such breach has caused damages to the Claimant, in respect of which the Claimant is entitled to compensation.\n\n**e) The alleged retaliation of Guatemala against EEGSA**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n712.\n\nIn its first Memorial, Claimant alleged that after having unilaterally set the electricity tariffs, the Respondent retaliated against the efforts of EEGSA to review the CNEE\u2019s decisions by (i) purporting to arrest senior managers of EEGSA on baseless charges, and (ii) harassing the Manager of Planning, Control and Regulation of EEGSA, Mr. Calleja, who had to leave the country572.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 205 *et seq.*\n\n713.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal, first of all, finds no evidence in the record that the arrest warrants issued in August 2008 against the managers of Mr. Mat\u00e9 and Mr. G\u00f3mez were such retaliatory measures. It rather appears that such arrest warrants were in connection with an unrelated dispute between EEGSA and a private company who filed the criminal charges. In addition, the warrants were subsequently suspended and annulled by the Court of Appeals of Guatemala573.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 457-458; Exhibit C-296; Statements CWS-6, \u00a7\u00a7 66-72 and CWS-3, \u00a7 55.\n\n714.\n\nAs to the alleged harassment of Mr. Calleja, the Claimant submits that, after Mr. Calleja made declarations on the radio about the disputed actions of the CNEE, his car had been broken into and his laptop computer had been stolen. Claimant adds that *\"the break-in appeared to be the work of professionals and had required someone to follow him\"574.*\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 206; Statement CWS-3, \u00a7 55.\n\n715.\n\nThere is however no evidence that such events are attributable to the Respondent. As a consequence, Claimant\u2019s arguments in this respect are rejected.\n\n**IX. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n716.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it is entitled to two heads of damages. First of all, the Claimant seeks recovery for its portion of the cash flow lost by EEGSA from August 2008 until October 2010 (such date being the date of EEGSA\u2019s sale to EPM) as a result of the application of a tariff based on the Sigla study (historical losses). Second, the Claimant seeks to be compensated for the depressed value at which it sold its shares in October 2010 (loss of value).\n\n717.\n\nOn the first head of claim, the Claimant seeks US$21,100,552. On the second head of claim, the Claimant seeks US$222,484,783,575\n\nClaimant PHB Reply, \u00a7 154.3; Report CER-5, \u00a7\u00a7 135-141, Table 14. Claimant\u2019s expert, Mr. Kaczmarek revised the calculation of damages according to some observations of Respondent\u2019s expert, (adjusting the VNR from 2006 to 2008 and using the PPI instead of the CPI). This revision increased the valuation conclusions of Mr.Kaczmarek.\n\n718.\n\nIn support of its valuation, the Claimant relies on the expert evidence of Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek of Navigant Consulting.576 The Respondent, on its side, relies on the expert evidence of Mr. Mario C. Damonte577, as well as of Messrs. Manuel A. Abdala and Marcelo A. Schoeters.578\n\nReports CER-2 and CER-5.\n\nReports RER-2 and RER-5.\n\nReports RER-1 and RER-4.\n\n719.\n\nAs an initial matter, both Parties agree on the methodology to be applied to both heads of damages, i.e. the difference between an actual scenario (actual cash flows during the historical period and EEGSA\u2019s sale value to EPM) and a but for scenario (cash flows that would have been received during the historical period and the higher value to which EEGSA would have been sold to EPM in absence of breach).\n\n720.\n\nThe experts also agree on the DCF model to calculate the but for scenario, but disagree on certain inputs.\n\n721.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will first **(1)** decide the points of disagreement between the Parties as to the inputs in the DCF model. Based on its findings, it will then **(2)** address the historical losses, and **(3)** the alleged loss of value in the sale to EPM. Finally, the Arbitral tribunal will address **(4)** interest and **(5)** costs.\n\n1. Valuation base and inputs\n----------------------------\n\n722.\n\nThe Parties are essentially in disagreement on three important aspects of the but for scenario: **(b)** the value of the VNR, (c) the proper FRC and **(d)** the level of capital expenditures.\n\n723.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Arbitral Tribunal will decide the Parties\u2019 disagreement on whether the proper base of valuation should be the Bates White 5 May, 2008 report as corrected by Mr. Damonte or the 28 July, 2008 report **(a).**\n\n**a) Valuation base**\n---------------------\n\n724.\n\nThe first point of disagreement between the Parties is whether the but for scenario should be calculated, as Claimant contends, on the basis of the July 28, 2008 version of the Bates White study or on the basis of the May 5, 2008 version of such study, as corrected by Mr. Damonte based on the pronouncements of the Expert Commission.\n\n725.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that there should not be any difference between one or the other. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, in order to be consistent with the regulatory framework, the valuation base should be the May 5, 2008 study, as amended in order to take into account the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements, subject to, as the case may be, any inconsistency between such pronouncements and the regulatory framework to which the regulator could in good faith have objected to.\n\n726.\n\nIt is however undisputed that, in correcting the Bates White May 2008 study, Mr. Damonte disregarded the Expert Commission pronouncements at least on one important question, i.e. the FRC.579 The Arbitral Tribunal, in earlier sections of this award580, has already decided that there is no reason to depart from the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncement on this question. The Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncement on the FRC is in fact consistent with the regulatory framework and the regulator would have had no valid reason to object to it.\n\nTranscript, Day 6, p. 1557, \u00a7 22 - p. 1558, \u00a7 15.\n\nSee above, \u00a7\u00a7 699-702.\n\n727.\n\nBecause the May 2008 study as corrected by Mr. Damonte departs from the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncement on this important question, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot usefully refer to it as a basis for assessing the but for scenario.\n\n728.\n\nAs a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal will work on the basis of the July 28, 2008 version of the study, and assess whether Respondent\u2019s criticism to such study and the resulting but for scenario are reasonable on each of the three main areas of disagreement. The Tribunal considers that this approach will allow calculation of damages with a sufficient degree of certainty based on what the tariffs should have been had the CNEE complied with the regulatory framework.\n\n**b) The VNR**\n--------------\n\n729.\n\nEssentially, the Claimant bases its but for scenario on an asset base of the company (VNR) of US$1,102 million as established in the Bates White 28 July study, while the Respondent adopts the lower figure of US$629 million proposed by Mr. Damonte.\n\n730.\n\nAccording to Messrs. Abdala and Schoeter581, the VNR proposed in the 28 July study is artificially high and does not incorporate all the corrections proposed by the Expert Commission. Mr. Damonte\u2019s evidence is to the same effect582. Mr. Kaczmarek, to the contrary, opines that the VNR in force in 2008 (at the end of the previous tariff period) was US$744.2 million, and that a deduction of more than US$80 million on the VNR would not make sense583.\n\nReports RER-1, \u00a7\u00a7 47 *et seq.,* and RER-4, \u00a7\u00a7 20 *et seq.*\n\nReport RER-5, \u00a7\u00a7 192 *et seq.*\n\nReport CER-5, \u00a7 58 and Figure 3, Mr. Kaczmarek had calculated the VNR proposed by Damonte inUS$ 661.1 million.\n\n731.\n\nAfter careful review of the evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that the Bates White 28 July study failed to incorporate the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements or that there is any reason to depart from such pronouncements. The Respondent did not establish, other than by noting that there is an important difference between the accounting asset base and the regulatory asset base, that Bates White failed to properly incorporate the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements in its 28 July study. The Respondent however accepts that the regulatory framework is not based on the accounting asset base and that the regulatory base can be different. Nor did the Respondent establish that the regulator would have had any valid reasons to disregard the pronouncements of the Expert Commission regarding the asset base.\n\n732.\n\nAs a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal will accept the VNR proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek.\n\n**c) The FRC**\n--------------\n\n733.\n\nThe difference between the Parties on the FRC is that the July 28 Bates White\u2019s study is based, as proposed by the Expert Commission, on an FRC which incorporates a lower rate of amortization (i.e. 1.09), thus leading to a higher VAD, while Mr. Damonte corrected the Bates White May 5 study on the basis of a higher factor of amortization (i.e. 1.42), which effect is thus to lower the VAD584.\n\nReport RER-5, Table 5.\n\n734.\n\nThe reason for this is that, according to the Respondent, *\"the scheme proposed by the EC overcompensates the investor\"585* and is inconsistent with Bates White\u2019s Terms of Reference586.\n\nReport RER-4, \u00a729.\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7 184.\n\n735.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has however already decided587 that the decision of the Expert Commission on the FRC is reasonable and consistent with the regulatory framework. The Arbitral Tribunal has further decided that the regulator would have had no valid reason to disregard such decision588.\n\nSee above, \u00a7 726.\n\nSee above, \u00a7\u00a7 699-702.\n\n736.\n\nAs a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts the FRC proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek.\n\n**d) Capital expenditures**\n---------------------------\n\n737.\n\nThe Parties are in disagreement on the proper level of capital expenditure of EEGSA. Respondent avers that *\"Mr Kazmarek\u2019s model projects investments far below the needs of the company (US$46.2 million per year). More importantly still, the projections are lower than those included in the Bates White model (US$76.5 million).\"589*\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7 337.\n\n738.\n\nThe Claimant avers that, at the hearing, Respondent\u2019s experts Mssrs. Abdala and Schoeters acknowledged that, because Mr. Kaczmarek corrected its but for investments, *\"there are no longer any significant differences between the parties as to the amount of investments EEGSA would have made\"590*\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7 181; Report RER-4, \u00a7 2.\n\n739.\n\nHowever, Mr. Abdala explained at the hearing591 that his statement was premised on the adoption of the lower VNR as proposed by Mr. Damonte, whereas the higher asset base proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek would necessary warrant a higher level of capital expenditures.\n\nTranscript, Day 6, p. 1528, \u00a7\u00a7 8 ***et seq.***\n\n740.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that an increase of the regulatory asset base entails a proportional increase of the capital expenditures. It is in fact undisputed that the regulatory asset base may differ from the actual asset base592. In addition, as noted by the Claimant593, the amount of capital expenditures proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek is twice as high as EEGSA\u2019s historical capital expenditures, which the Arbitral Tribunal finds reasonable.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 31, \u00a7 22 - p. 32, \u00a7 8; p. 286, \u00a7 13 -p. 287, \u00a7 3.\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7 183; Transcript, Day 6, p. 1513, \u00a7\u00a7 12-16; Report CER-5, Figure 4.\n\n741.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts the capital expenditures proposed by Mr. Kaczmarek.\n\n2. Historical losses\n--------------------\n\n742.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal finds that Respondent\u2019s breach caused losses to the Claimant. Such damages amount to the (i) Claimant\u2019s share of the higher revenues that EEGSA would have received had the CNEE observed due process in the tariff review, (ii) to run from the moment the high revenues would have been first received until the moment when the Claimant sold its share in EEGSA. The amount of such losses must be quantified in the \"but for\" scenario discussed by the Parties, on the basis of what the tariffs should have been had the CNEE complied with the regulatory framework. As said in \u00a7 728 above, such assessment is properly made on the basis of the Bates White\u2019s July 28, 2008 study. The Arbitral Tribunal has accepted the Claimant\u2019s views on the three issues that are in dispute in respect of that study (i.e. the VNR, the FRC and the CAPEX). As a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal accepts the Claimant\u2019s claim for its historical losses of US$21,100,552.\n\n3. Loss of value\n----------------\n\n743.\n\nOn 21 October 2010, DECA II (the holding company of EEGSA) was sold to EPM.\n\n744.\n\nThe Claimant avers that the decision to sell EEGSA was driven by the substantial losses suffered by the company as a consequence of the imposition of a low tariff based on the Sigla study594, and that the sale price to EPM was substantially lowered as a consequence of such situation.595 The Claimant seeks US$222,484,783 corresponding to its share of the lost value in the sale to EPM.596\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 220-227.\n\n***Ibid.,*** \u00a7 227.\n\nReport CER-5, Table 14.\n\n745.\n\nThe Claimant relies, in its submissions that it decided to sell DECA II as a consequence of the CNEE\u2019s arbitrary actions, in the board of directors\u2019 meeting of EEGSA held on October 14, 2010.597\n\nReply, \u00a7 222; Claimant PHB, \u00a7 202; Exhibit C-353.\n\n746.\n\nRespondent, on the contrary, submits that the minutes of such board of directors\u2019 meeting were prepared after Teco had sent its notice of intent on January 9, 2009 and before this arbitration started, and therefore that they took into account the arguments that Teco would make in this arbitration.598 Moreover, the Respondent asserts that the fact that Teco did not try to sell its ownership stake for more than two years after the measures of the CNEE, and that it proceeded to sell only at the suggestion of its partner Iberdrola599 is sufficient to prove that the sale was not motivated by the CNEE\u2019s measures but responded exclusively to corporate policies that had nothing to do with EEGSA\u2019s tariff review process in 2008.600\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 474.\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7 357; Transcript Day 2, p. 580, \u00a7\u00a7 20 ***et seq.***\n\nRespondent Reply PHB, \u00a7 174; Exhibits R-132, R-130 and R-162.\n\n747.\n\nThe minutes of the October 14, 2010 board of directors\u2019 meeting of EEGSA state the following: *\"The proposed sale provides us with an opportunity to exit a minority position in a business where we perceive risk to have meaningfully increased. As discussed at previous Board meetings, the Guatemalan government regulator, acting outside the process prescribed in the Guatemalan electricity law, imposed a significant reduction of the tariff rate for distribution (VAD) on EEGSA in its rate case in August 2008, the subject of the CAFTA claim discussed below. We believe there is continued risk of government interference in EEGSA business.\"601*\n\nExhibit C-353.\n\n748.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has no reasons to doubt that, as reflected in the minutes, the decision to divest was taken primarily as a consequence of the breach by the CNEE of the regulatory framework. It is certainly true that, as pointed out by the Respondent, the tariff had been into force for two years at that time. However, judicial proceedings had been pending before the Guatemalan courts until 2010 and it is understandable that Teco waited until then to take a decision to divest. It is also true that other considerations might have come into play, such as Iberdrola's own business decisions. However, this does not alter the fact that the breach by the CNEE of the regulatory framework has played an important role in Teco\u2019s decision to divest.\n\n749.\n\nNevertheless, as will be seen in further sections of this award, the Arbitral Tribunal finds no sufficient evidence of the existence and quantum of the losses that were allegedly suffered as a consequence of the sale.\n\n750.\n\nIt is undisputed that DECA II was sold to EPM for US$605 million. The Parties are in slight disagreement on the share of the price that is attributed to EEGSA. According to Mr. Kaczmarek, such share is US$562.4 million602, while Messrs. Abdala and Schoeters submit that EEGSA\u2019s value in the sale was between US$518 million and US$582 million603.\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7 168; Report CER-5, \u00a7 135, Table 13 (according to Mr. Kaczmarek the equity value of EEGSA becomes US$474.8 million once the net debt is subtracted).\n\nReport RER-4, \u00a732.\n\n751.\n\nThe Parties nevertheless differ substantially as to EEGSA\u2019s *but for* value. The Claimant asserts a value of US$1,479.3 million604, while the Respondent proposes a value of US$594.9 million605.\n\nReport CER-5, \u00a7140, Table 13 (according to Mr. Kaczmarek the weighted average enterprise value of US$1,479 is reduced to US$1,391 once the net debt of EEGSA is subtracted); Mr. Kaczmarek Presentation, slides 12 and 39).\n\nReport RER-4, \u00a776.\n\n752.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal accepts that the existing tariffs were taken into account in fixing the price of the transaction.\n\n753.\n\nIn an interview to the press on October 23, 2010, the CEO of EPM Mr. Federico Restrepo made the following statements: \"Q. *The shareholders argued that there would be lower revenue and profitabdity due to the VAD. Despite this issue, you decided to buy?* A. *This is reflected in the value of the transaction. We bought on the basis that the current tariff model and layout is the one that exists. Clearly it has an impact on the final valuation and we had no expectation that it would be modified or changed.* Q. *You must start preparing for the VAD of the next five year period. Do you think it can improve with respect to the current one?* A. *Our valuation process of the company included various scenarios one of them being that the VAD - value received by distributors for the service - would not be modified. This is what we studied.* Q. *when you mention the valuation process, does it mean that the company would have costed more with another VAD?* A. *That is possible. For the same cost you receive more revenue, you have more cash of course.\"606*\n\nExhibit R-l33, Tribunal translation, in original in Spanish: \"P: *Los accionistas argumentaban baja de ingresos y rentabilidad por el VAD. \u00bfA\u00fan con ese tema decidieron comprar?* R: *Eso se refleja en el valor de la transacci\u00f3n, nosotros compramos sobre la base de que el modelo y esquema tarifario que hay hoy es el que est\u00e1; y por supuesto, eso tiene una incidencia en la valoraci\u00f3n final y no tenemos ninguna expectativa que vaya a ver* (sic) *modificaciones en otro sentido.* P; *Deben empezar a prepararse para el VAD del pr\u00f3ximo quinquenio. \u00bfCreen que puede mejorarse respecto al actual?* R: *Nuestro proceso de valoraci\u00f3n - de la empresa - inclu\u00eda varios escenarios y entre ellos el que no se modificaba (el VAD -valor que cobran la distribuidoras por servicio - eso fue parte de lo que estudiamos.* P; *Cuando menciona el proceso de valoraci\u00f3n \u00bfquiere decir que la empresa hubiera costado m\u00e1s con otro VAD?* R: *Es posible, para los mismos costos mayores ingresos genera; m\u00e1s caja, por supuesto.\"*\n\n754.\n\nSuch statements show that the existing tariff were considered as a relevant factor in determining the price of the transaction. There is however no sufficient evidence that, had the 2008-2013 tariffs been higher, the transaction price would have reflected the higher revenues of the company until 2013. The interview of Mr. Restrepo only mentions as a \"possibility\" that with a higher VAD for the rest of the tariff period, the transaction price would have been higher. And there no evidence in the record of how the transaction price has been determined. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore ignores what other factors might have come into play and cannot conclude with sufficient certainty that an increase in revenues until 2013 would have been reflected in the purchase price and to what extent.\n\n755.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal also finds no evidence that, as submitted by the Claimant, the valuation of the company reflected the assumption that the tariffs would remain unchanged beyond 2013 and forever.\n\n756.\n\nIn fact, while Mr. Restrepo says in his interview that the purchaser assumed that the tariffs were likely to remain the same for future tariff periods, he also says that such a scenario was only one of those which were considered by the purchaser.\n\n757.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the claim is in this respect speculative.607 The Respondent rightly points out that *\"it is actually impossible to know what will happen with the tariffs in the future.\"608*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 38.\n\nRespondent PHB, \u00a7 354.\n\n758.\n\nThe regulatory framework permits EEGSA to seek adjustments of the tariffs, and the VAD is recalculated every 5 years. As a consequence, there was nothing preventing the distributor from seeking an increase of the tariffs at the end of the 2008-2013 tariff period. In this respect, no information has been provided to the Arbitral Tribunal regarding the establishment of the 2013-2018 tariffs. Likewise, there is no indication that the distributor will be prevented from seeking a change in the tariffs in 2018.\n\n759.\n\nFinally, the regulatory framework may change, with consequences on future tariff review processes as well as on the future level of the VAD.\n\n760.\n\nAs a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot accept that the sale price to EPM was based on the assumption that tariffs would remain forever unchanged post-2013.\n\n761.\n\nAsa consequence of the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal will reject the claim for loss of value.\n\n4. Interest\n-----------\n\n762.\n\nThe Claimant seeks simple and compounded interest at the rate of 8.8 percent from August 1st, 2008 (first day of the 2008-2013 tariff period) until full payment. The 8.8 percent interest rate corresponds to EEGSA\u2019s WACC in October 2010.609\n\nClaimant PHB, \u00a7 202; Report CER-2, \u00a7 195.\n\n763.\n\nThe Respondent does not object to the request for pre-award interest. The Respondent also does not object to the claim for compounded interest.\n\n764.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s submission, however, the pre-award interest *\"must be adjusted to the WACC in effect before the TGH sale (since TGH even assumed an operating risk) and from 21 October onwards using an adjustment factor based on a risk-free rate, such as (for example) US 10-Year government bonds. On average, these bonds produced a yield of 3.3 percent during the period of August 2008-October 2010 and 2.8 during October 2010-December 2011.\"610*\n\nRespondent Reply PHB, \u00a7175; Report RER-1, \u00a7 111.\n\n765.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that interest should only accrue from the date of the sale of EEGSA to EPM in October 2010. As a matter of fact, because the US$21,100,552 historical losses damages correspond to revenues that would have progressively flowed into EEGSA from August 2008 until October 2010, and because such amount has not been discounted to August 2008611, calculating interest on the entire amount of the historical damages as from the first day of the tariff period would result in an unjust enrichment of the Claimant. As a consequence, interest shall only accrue from October 21, 2010.\n\nReport CER-2, Appendix 3.A.\n\n766.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that applying EEGSA\u2019s WACC post-October 2010 would not make sense since the Claimant had sold its interest in EEGSA and ceased to assume the company\u2019s operating risks. The Arbitral Tribunal thus agrees with the Respondent that a risk-free rate should be applied.\n\n767.\n\nBecause the loss suffered by the Claimant corresponds to the cost of borrowing money in the United States, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s evidence612 that the proper interest should be based on the US Prime rate of interest plus a 2 percent premium in order to reflect a rate that is broadly available to the market.\n\nReport CER-2, \u00a7 222; Exhibit C-415.\n\n768.\n\nAs a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the damages granted to the Claimant will bear pre and post-award interest at the US Prime rate of interest plus a 2 percent premium from October 21, 2010 until full payment. Such interest shall be compounded on an annual basis.\n\n**X. The Costs**\n----------------\n\n769.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that *\"the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and the expenses of the members of the tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award\"*\n\n770.\n\nRule 28 of the Arbitration Rules provides that *\"(1) Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of the proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide:*\n\n*(a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre;*\n\n*(b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties\"*\n\n771.\n\nRule 47(l)(j) of the Arbitration Rules also provides that the award should contain *\"any decision of the Tribunal regarding the costs of the proceeding\".*\n\n772.\n\nAccording to the timetable agreed by the Parties, each party presented its submissions on costs on July 24, 2013, and reply to submissions on costs on August 7, 2013. The Respondent submitted an updated claim for expenses on November 18, 2013, to take into account the payment of the third advance of fees and costs.\n\n773.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it incurred the following fees and expenses:\n\n\u2022 Legal fees and expenses: US$6,327,903.29\n\n\u2022 Expert and consultant fees and expenses: US$2,932,603.33\n\n\u2022 Arbitration expenses of TECO: US$17,087.24\n\n\u2022 ICSID costs: US$750,000\n\nTotal of incurred costs: US$10,027,593.86\n\n774.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that it incurred the following fees and expenses:\n\n\u2022 Legal and expert fees: US$4,370,638.10\n\n\u2022 Costs of witnesses and government representatives: US$154,409.33\n\n\u2022 ICSID costs: US$725,000.00 (reflecting the Respondent\u2019s payment of US$250,000.00 as requested in the Secretary\u2019s letter of August 7, 2013, and confirmed by the Respondent in its letter of November 18, 2013).\n\nTotal of incurred costs: US$5,250,047.43\n\n775.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal finds that such costs are justified and appropriate in view of the complexity of this case.\n\n776.\n\nEach party requested that the other be ordered to support the entirely of its costs and expenses. Both parties submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal should apply the principle that costs follow the event613.

However, the Respondent has been partially successful on quantum.\n\n779.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that the Respondent will support the entirety of its costs and reimburse 75 percent of the costs supported by the Claimant, i.e.: US$7,520,695.39\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n780.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal decides:\n\nA.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 22 April 2014, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre), pursuant to Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), registered an application by the Republic of Guatemala (Guatemala) for the annulment of the Award of the Tribunal rendered on 19 December 2013 (the Award) in the case of *Teco Guatemala Holdings LLC v. The Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23) (Guatemala's Application). On the same day, ICSID also registered an application by TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC for the partial annulment of the Award (TECO's Application).\n\n2.\n\nIn Guatemala's Application, Guatemala sought annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the ICSID Convention), specifically claiming that:\n\na) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\nb) The Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based; and\n\nc) The Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n3.\n\nGuatemala's Application also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the Arbitration Rules, for a stay of enforcement of the Award until Guatemala's Application for Annulment is decided.\n\n4.\n\nUpon registering Guatemala's Application for Annulment on 22 April 2014, the Secretary General of ICSID notified the Parties that, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n5.\n\nOn 17 October 2014, Guatemala reiterated its request for the stay of enforcement of the Award in its Memorial on Annulment. On the same day, in its Memorial on Partial Annulment, TECO requested the Committee to either terminate the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award, or condition the continuation of the stay upon Guatemala posting a bond in the full amount of the Award.\n\n6.\n\nOn 25 November 2014, the *ad hoc* Committee invited the Parties to agree on a procedural schedule for the filing of their submissions concerning the continuation/termination of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n7.\n\nOn 3 December 2014, the Parties informed the *ad hoc* Committee of their agreement on a schedule for submissions on the continuation/termination of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n8.\n\nOn 19 December 2014, Guatemala filed its Request for the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award (Guatemala's Request).\n\n9.\n\nOn 9 January 2015, TECO filed its Response to Guatemala's Request for the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award (TECO's Response).\n\n10.\n\nOn 16 January 2015, the *ad hoc* Committee invited Guatemala to comment on TECO's representation that, in light of Guatemala's assurances that it would comply with the Award if it is not annulled, TECO would not oppose the stay of enforcement of the Award in the absence of Guatemala posting a bond, should the *ad hoc* Committee consider such a stay appropriate.\n\n11.\n\nOn 30 January 2015, Guatemala submitted a letter pursuant to the *ad hoc* Committee's instructions of 16 January 2015.\n\n12.\n\nOn 3 February 2015, TECO replied to Guatemala's 30 January 2015 letter.\n\n**B. The Parties' Contentions**\n-------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nIn its 19 December 2014 Request for the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, Guatemala requested that the *ad hoc* Committee continue the stay of enforcement of the Award, without Respondent having to provide security for the eventual payment of the Award.\n\na) Guatemala's Position\n-----------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn this respect, Guatemala contended that Article 10.26.6 of the CAFTA-DR unequivocally provides that a final award may not be enforced by a Party until revision or annulment proceedings have been completed. This automatic stay is not conditioned upon a party offering some form of security for the payment of the award.\n\n15.\n\nRespondent added that the usual practice of ICSID annulment committees favors the continuation of the stay of enforcement of awards, and the stay is only lifted in exceptional circumstances. Guatemala considers that no such exceptional circumstances exist in the present case, where both Parties have filed requests for annulment and where there is no evidence that Respondent will not comply with the Award if it is not annulled. In this respect, Guatemala claims that it has no record of non-compliance with ICSID or other arbitral awards and that the only evidence purportedly to the contrary that was proffered by TECO is a statement in a newspaper article which was not made by the President of Guatemala, but is merely the opinion of a journalist.\n\n16.\n\nGuatemala also argued that its Application for annulment is not dilatory in nature and is not manifestly abusive. Guatemala stated that its good faith is evidenced by the diametrically divergent conclusions of the *Iberdrola v. Guatemala1* tribunal, who found that it had no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over a case based on the same facts and controversy. Thus, Guatemala is justified in bringing its application.\n\n*Iberdrola Energ\u00eda S.A. v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/5, Award of 17 August 2012 (RL-32).\n\n17.\n\nMoreover, Guatemala considers that the continuation of the stay of enforcement will not be detrimental to TECO, who could be compensated for the delay in enforcement by the payment of interest.\n\n18.\n\nFinally, Respondent argued that posting a bond as a condition for the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award is not provided for in the ICSID Convention and was specifically excluded by the negotiators of the Convention. Posting a bond would create an imbalance between the Parties, as it would put TECO in a more favorable situation than it had been in prior to the application for the stay of enforcement.\n\n19.\n\nGuatemala also requested that it be awarded the costs it incurred for the defense of its Request.\n\nb) TECO's position\n------------------\n\n20.\n\nIn its Memorial on Partial Annulment of the Award, dated 17 October 2014, TECO requested that the *ad hoc* Committee either deny Guatemala's request for a continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, or condition such a stay on Guatemala posting a bond in the full amount of the Award.\n\n21.\n\nClaimant argued that the posting of a bond was required in light of Guatemala having failed to give any reasonable assurances that it would pay the Award, if the Award was not annulled. TECO alleged that several *ad hoc* committees held that, in circumstances where the enforcement of an award is stayed, the award debtor must provide security for the eventual payment of the award if it is not annulled.\n\n22.\n\nIn its 9 January 2015 Response to Guatemala's Request, TECO submitted the following:\n\n\"[I]n light of the assurances provided by Guatemala in its Request for the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement that Guatemala would comply with the Award if it is not annulled, TECO does not oppose the stay of enforcement of the Award in the absence of Guatemala posting a bond, should the Committee consider such a stay to be appropriate in the circumstances. Accordingly, in Claimant's view, further submissions on the stay of enforcement requested by Guatemala are unnecessary. There is no basis, however, for the Committee to order Claimant to pay Respondents' costs in defending its request for the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, as elaborated below.\"2 [emphasis added]\n\nResponse, \u00b6 2\n\n23.\n\nTECO contended that there was no basis for Guatemala being awarded the costs for defending its Request. In this respect, TECO invoked the fact that Guatemala first referred to Article 10.26.6 of the CAFTA-DR-in its Request. In its Memorial on Annulment, Guatemala had instead relied on the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules. TECO considers that the stay of enforcement of an award may only be ordered pursuant to the absolute provisions of the ICSID Convention, and not based on the provisions of other agreements or treaties. Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), since the *ad hoc* Committee did not make a ruling on Guatemala's request for a continuation of the stay of enforcement within 30 days from Respondent's 17 October 2014 Annulment Memorial, the provisional stay of enforcement has already automatically terminated. In light of this termination, the *ad hoc* Committee has discretion to decide whether the enforcement of the Award should be stayed.\n\n24.\n\nIn its 30 January 2015 letter to the *ad hoc* Committee, Respondent indicated its agreement with Claimant's proposal to have no more submissions on the issue of the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award. However, Guatemala argued that TECO's agreement to the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award appeared to be inconsistent with its request that the Committee decide on the appropriateness of the stay. Guatemala considers that the Committee's decision is not discretionary and should be based on Article 10.26.6 of the CAFTA-DR, which in effect represents the agreement of the Parties for an automatic stay of enforcement. Within this letter, Guatemala reiterated its request to be awarded the costs of this stage of the proceedings.\n\n25.\n\nIn response to Guatemala's position, TECO argued in its 3 February 2015 letter that Article 10.26.6 of the CAFTA-DR does not provide for an automatic stay of enforcement of the Award, but only that a disputing party may not seek enforcement until annulment proceedings are completed. An *ad hoc* Committee has discretion to stay the enforcement of an award only if it considers that the circumstances so require. TECO also contended that there was no basis for Guatemala being awarded the costs of this stage of the arbitration.\n\n**C. Relevant provisions**\n--------------------------\n\n26.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\"\n\n27.\n\nArbitration Rule 54 reads:\n\n\"(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\"\n\n28.\n\nArticle 10.26.5 and 10.26.6 of the CAFTA-DR read in relevant part:\n\n\"5. Subject to paragraph 6 and the applicable review procedure for an interim award, a disputing party shall abide by and comply with an award without delay.\n\n6. A disputing party may not seek enforcement of a final award until:\n\n(a) In the case of a final award made under the ICSID Convention\n\n(i) 120 days have elapsed from the date the award was rendered and no disputing party has requested revision or annulment of the award; or\n\n(ii) revision or annulment proceedings have been completed\".\n\n**D. The** ***ad hoc*** **Committee's views**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nAfter having carefully examined the Parties' submissions in this regard, the *ad hoc* Committee decides that the stay of enforcement of the Award shall continue until a decision on the Parties' respective applications for annulment is rendered, without Guatemala being required to post a bond.\n\n30.\n\nIn this respect, the *ad hoc* Committee observes that the Parties are in substantial agreement that a continuation of the stay of enforcement is warranted without Guatemala posting a bond. What the Parties do not agree on are the grounds for such an outcome. While Guatemala contends that this is the result of the application of Article 10.26.6 of the CAFTA-DR, which provides for an automatic stay of enforcement of a challenged award, TECO considers that the stay of enforcement of the Award is at the discretion of the *ad hoc* Committee, in light of the circumstances of the case.\n\n31.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee first observes that both the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, and the CAFTA-DR are applicable to the present proceedings.\n\n32.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, the *ad hoc* Committee has discretion when deciding whether to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award or not. In the present case, the Committee observes that there is agreement between the Parties that the stay of enforcement of the Award may continue without Guatemala posting a bond until a decision on annulment is rendered.\n\n33.\n\nIn addition, Article 10.26.6 of the CAFTA-DR does not allow the disputing Parties to seek enforcement of the challenged Award before annulment proceedings are finalized.\n\n34.\n\nMoreover, Guatemala has represented to this Committee that it undertakes to comply with the Award if it is not annulled.\n\n35.\n\nAs a result, this *ad hoc* Committee sees no reason not to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award pending the finalization of the annulment proceedings. The *ad hoc* Committee also decides that Guatemala shall not be required to post a bond.\n\n36.\n\nWith respect to the issue of costs, the *ad hoc* Committee is guided by the provisions of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1), corroborated with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53, which stipulate that the Committee has discretion with regard to the allocation of costs. The *ad hoc* Committee sees no need to make a decision on costs at this preliminary stage of the proceedings. However, the Committee takes note of the Parties' respective positions on this matter, and will take them into account when rendering a decision on costs at the end of the annulment proceedings. The Parties are therefore advised to keep a separate account of the costs incurred in this phase of the arbitration.\n\n**Decision**\n------------\n\n37.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee unanimously decides:\n\n(1) The stay of enforcement of the Award shall continue in effect for the duration of these annulment proceedings;\n\n(2) To reserve all other issues, including any question as to costs, to a further order or decision at the end of the annulment proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2016-04-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 18 April 2014, the Republic of Guatemala (\"Guatemala\", \"Respondent\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") an application for the annulment of the award rendered on 19 December 2013 (\"the Award\") in the case of *Teco Guatemala Holdings LLC v. The Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23) (\"Guatemala\u2019s Application\"). On the same day, TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC (\"TECO\", \"Claimant\") filed an application for the partial annulment of the Award (\"TECO\u2019S Application\"). Guatemala\u2019s Application and TECO\u2019S Application shall together hereinafter be referred to as the \"Applications\". The Applications were filed in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"ICSID Convention\"), and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Applications were made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Application also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the Arbitration Rules, for a stay of enforcement of the Award until Guatemala\u2019s Application is decided.\n\n4.\n\nOn 22 April 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered both Guatemala\u2019s Application and TECO\u2019S Application, and in accordance with Arbitration Rule 50(2), transmitted a Notice of Registration for each of the Applications.\n\n5.\n\nUpon registering Guatemala\u2019s Application on 22 April 2014, the Secretary General of ICSID notified the Parties that, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 20 May 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties that one Committee would be appointed to hear both annulment applications.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 29 May 2014, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 52(2), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that an *ad hoc* Committee (\u2019\u2019the Committee\") had been constituted, composed of Prof. Bernard Hanotiau (Belgian) as President, Ms. Tinuade Oyekunle (Nigerian) and Dr. Klaus Sachs (German) as Members, and that the annulment proceedings were deemed to have begun on that date. The Parties were also informed that Mrs. Anneliese Fleckenstein, Legal Counsel at ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n8.\n\nBy agreement of the Parties, the Committee held its first session by telephone conference on 10 July 2014.

Attal, III, TECO Energy, Inc., Senior Vice President-General Counsel, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer Mr. Javier Cuebas, TECO Energy, Inc., Corporate Counsel\n\n9.\n\nDuring the first session, the Parties confirmed their agreement on certain procedural matters and made oral submissions on certain points of disagreement. Among other things, the Parties agreed on the timetable of the proceeding, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in force as of April 2006, and that English and Spanish will be the languages of the proceedings. The Parties did not agree on the issue of the submissions by CAFTA-DR nondisputing State Parties, under Article 10.20.2 of the CAFTA-DR.\n\n10.\n\nOn 1 August 2014, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1. In addition to confirming the Parties\u2019 agreements, the Order stated that submissions by non-disputing State Parties pursuant to CAFTA-DR Article 10.20.2, if any, should be filed no later than 16 March 2015. The Committee reserved its decision on the oral submissions of the non-disputing State Parties for a later stage of the proceedings. The Committee confirmed the Parties\u2019 agreement that Ms. Iuliana Iancu act as Assistant to the President of the *ad hoc* Committee. The Spanish translation of Procedural Order No. 1 was issued on 20 October 2014.\n\n11.\n\nOn 17 October 2014, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Guatemala filed its Memorial on Annulment, and reiterated its request for the stay of enforcement of the Award (\"Guatemala\u2019s Memorial\"), along with the accompanying documentation, and TECO filed its Memorial on Partial Annulment (\"TECO\u2019S Memorial\"), together with its corresponding documentation. The Spanish translations of the Parties\u2019 submissions were filed on 30 October 2014.\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 November 2014, the Secretary-General informed the Members of the Committee that, due to an internal redistribution of workload at the Centre, Ms. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski was appointed to serve as Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n13.\n\nOn 19 December 2014, Guatemala filed its Request for the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, and on 9 January 2015, TECO filed its Response.\n\n14.\n\nOn 26 January 2015, the Committee confirmed the Parties\u2019 agreement to extend the deadline for the filing of the Parties\u2019 respective Counter-Memorials on Annulment until 9 February 2015.\n\n15.\n\nOn 9 February 2015, Guatemala filed its Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment, together with its corresponding factual exhibits and legal authorities. On the same day, TECO filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment (\"TECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial\"), along with its respective documentation.\n\n16.\n\nOn 10 February 2015, the Committee issued its Decision on Guatemala\u2019s Request for a Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award (Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules). The Committee decided that the stay of enforcement of the Award should continue to be in effect for the duration of the annulment proceedings.\n\n17.\n\nOn 26 February 2015, TECO requested that the Committee strike from the record Exhibits R-257 and R-258, as well as all references thereto, and to order Guatemala to re-file its Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment without any reference thereto. TECO requested that Guatemala\u2019s conduct be taken into account by the Committee when rendering its decision on the costs of these proceedings.\n\n18.\n\nOn 6 March 2015, Guatemala commented on TECO\u2019S request for the exclusion of evidence above.\n\n19.\n\nOn 11 March 2015, TECO responded to Guatemala\u2019s observations of 6 March 2015.\n\n20.\n\nOn 16 March 2015, Guatemala submitted its final comments with respect to TECO\u2019S request of 26 February 2015.\n\n21.\n\nOn 18 March 2015, the Committee found that Guatemala had failed to comply with Procedural Order No. 1 by filing Exhibits R-257 and R-258. As a result, the Committee decided to strike these exhibits from the record, along with any references thereto, and to order Guatemala to re-file its Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment by excluding from it any references to Exhibits R-257 and R-258 and to the damages sought in the *Iberdrola* v. *Guatemala* arbitration.1\n\n*Iberdrola Energia S.A.* v. *Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/5), Award, 17 August 2012 (Exhibit RL-130) (\"Iberdrola award\").\n\n22.\n\nOn 21 March 2015, Guatemala re-filed its Counter-Memorial on Partial Annulment (\"Guatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial\") pursuant to the directions of the Committee.\n\n23.\n\nOn 30 April 2015, the Committee confirmed the Parties\u2019 agreement to extend the deadline for the filing of their Replies on Annulment from 4 May 2015 to 8 May 2015.\n\n24.\n\nOn 8 May 2015, TECO filed its Reply on Partial Annulment (\"TECO\u2019S Reply\"), while Guatemala filed its Reply on Annulment (\"Guatemala\u2019s Reply\").\n\n25.\n\nOn 15 August 2015, TECO filed its Rejoinder on Annulment (\"TECO\u2019S Rejoinder\"), while Guatemala filed its Rejoinder on Partial Annulment (\"Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder\").\n\n26.\n\nThe hearing on annulment was held at the World Bank in Washington, D.C., on 13-15 October 2015.

THE AWARD**\n------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Award of 19 December 2013 was rendered by a Tribunal composed of Mr. Alexis Mourre (President, appointed jointly by the Parties), Prof. William W. Park (appointed by TECO) and Dr. Claus von Wobeser (appointed by Guatemala).\n\n34.\n\nAfter a brief introductory section, a section dedicated to the Parties\u2019 consent to arbitration and a section setting out the procedural history, the Award describes the factual background of the dispute in its Section IV. The facts can be summarized as follows.\n\n35.\n\nAccording to the Award, the dispute between the Parties arose from the alleged violation by the *Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica* (\"CNEE\") of the Guatemalan regulatory framework for the setting of energy distribution tariffs, with respect to EEGSA, the electricity company in which TECO had an indirect share.6\n\nAward, at 79.\n\n36.\n\nThe CNEE was created in 1996 through the adoption by the Congress of Guatemala of the General Electricity Law (\"LGE\"). The CNEE was a technical organ, composed of three members appointed by the Executive Branch every five years, and whose functions were, among others, ensuring compliance with the LGE and defining the transmission and distribution rates in accordance with the LGE. The LGE also set the basis for calculating the tariffs applicable to end consumers for final distribution. According to the LGE, the tariffs were set based on the \"model enterprise\" system and on the Value Added of Distribution (\"VAD\") which did not reimburse the distributor for its real costs, but on the basis of the costs that a hypothetical efficient company would have incurred. The regulatory framework also established that the VAD used to calculate tariffs would be determined on the basis of a study conducted by a consultant commissioned by each distributor and pre-qualified by the CNEE. The consultant would work under terms of reference drawn up by the CNEE, which would also have the right to monitor the progress of the studies. The finalized studies would be sent for review to the CNEE, who could make written objections. In case of such objections, the LGE provided that the CNEE and the distributor would appoint an expert commission who would pronounce itself on the differences. The LGE also provided that the methodology for determination of the rates would be reviewed by the CNEE every five years.\n\n37.\n\nOn 21 March 1997, Government Resolution No. 256-97 containing LGE Regulation (\"the RLGE\") was issued. The RLGE set the parameters for the establishment of the terms of reference for the distributors\u2019 studies, as well as the deadlines applicable to the tariff-setting procedure.\n\n38.\n\nIn February 1997, the Government of Guatemala initiated the process of privatizing EEGSA. In 1998, TECO ENERGY decided to participate in the share offering through its wholly owned subsidiary Teco Power Service Corporation de Ultramar Guatemala S.A. (\"TPS\"). In turn, TPS formed a Consortium with Iberdrola and EDP. The Consortium formed a Guatemalan investment company DECA I (49% held by Iberdrola, 30% by TPS, and 21% by EDP) to acquire EEGSA\u2019s shares. On 30 July 1998, the Consortium was declared the successful bidder and the closing took place on 11 September 1998.\n\n39.\n\nIn 1999, DECA I merged with EEGSA. Iberdrola, TPS and EDP formed a new Guatemalan company (DECA II) to be the holding for their participation. Between 1998 and 2005, the TECO ENERGY group was restructured, and an intermediary company was established between TECO ENERGY and EPS (known subsequently as Teco Guatemala Inc.). TPS\u2019s shares in DECA II were then transferred to Teco Guatemala Inc. Teco Guatemala Holdings LLC (Claimant) was constituted on 26 April 2005 and subsequently TPS\u2019s shares in DECA II were transferred to it.\n\n40.\n\nThe case that was before the Tribunal concerned the tariff review process for the period 2008-2013. On 30 April 2007, the CNEE transmitted to EEGSA the Terms of Reference. Initially, EEGSA brought an action in court for the protection of its constitutional rights *(amparo)* challenging the Terms of Reference, but the action was withdrawn in August 2007 following an agreement between the parties. Also in August 2007, EEGSA engaged Bates White as its VAD consultant. In October 2007, the CNEE selected Sigla as its own consultant.\n\n41.\n\nOn 29 October 2007, Bates White submitted its Stage A report of the VAD Study to EEGSA and the CNEE. In December 2007, the CNEE informed EEGSA that the report had not been properly submitted. In January 2008, the CNEE issued Resolutions Nos. 04-2008 and 05-2008, setting at 7 percent the real annual discount rate to be used to calculate distribution tariffs and including amendments to the Terms of Reference. These amendments contained new provisions relating to the capital recovery formula, including a 50 percent depreciation factor which was challenged in the original proceedings.\n\n42.\n\nDuring the following months, EEGSA and the CNEE met on several instances to discuss the Stage A report. In the course of these meetings, the CNEE raised various objections, whereupon EEGSA proceeded to correct the report by incorporating some amendments requested by the CNEE, and rejecting others.\n\n43.\n\nOn 16 May 2008, the CNEE transmitted to EEGSA Resolution No. 96-2008, informing EEGSA that the VAD Study had incorporated unsolicited changes and modifications, and that consequently an Expert Commission would be established in order to pronounce itself on the discrepancies. The CNEE listed nine categories of discrepancies to be considered by the Expert Commission.\n\n44.\n\nRepresentatives of EEGSA and the CNEE subsequently met to discuss the establishment of an Expert Commission and the draft operating rules. The parties agreed that Bates White would have to correct the study in order to reflect the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements, but not on who would assess whether these corrections properly reflected the Expert Commission\u2019s views. The CNEE considered that it would have to make these determinations itself, while EEGSA considered that the Expert Commission was tasked with this verification. On 6 June 2008, the CNEE and EEGSA signed the deed of appointment of the Expert Commission.\n\n45.\n\nOn 25 July 2008, the Expert Commission delivered its report to the CNEE and to EEGSA. On the same day, the CNEE adopted Resolution No. 3121 dissolving the Expert Commission. On 28 July 2008, EEGSA sent to the CNEE copies of the VAD study and a CD with supporting files, indicating that they had been modified to comport with the decision of the Expert Commission.\n\n46.\n\nOn 29 July 2008, EEGSA brought an action for the protection of its constitutional rights *(amparo),* requesting that CNEE\u2019s Resolution No. 3121 be reversed and that the CNEE be ordered to comply with the Expert Commission\u2019s report. The Court of first instance of Guatemala admitted the recourse on 30 July 2008, but then suspended the proceedings on the grounds that EEGSA had not exhausted the available administrative remedies.\n\n47.\n\nOn 31 July 2008, two of the three members of the Expert Commission met in Washington D.C. to review the amended VAD Study. The following day, they confirmed that all the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements had been implemented in Bates White\u2019s 28 July 2008 revised study.\n\n48.\n\nAlso on 1 August 2008, the CNEE issued Resolutions No. 144-2008, 145-2008 and 146-2008. Resolution No. 144-2008, dated 29 July 2008, found that the Bates White\u2019s May 2008 study had failed to correct all the observations made by the CNEE through its Resolution No. 63-2008. In Resolutions Nos. 145-2008 and 146-2008, the CNEE set the tariffs and periodic adjustment formulas for EEGSA clients, effective from 1 August 2008 and 31 July 2013, on the basis of the Sigla study, which adopted the Capital Recovery Factor set in the Terms of Reference and depreciated the VNR by 50 percent.\n\n49.\n\nEEGSA initiated administrative recourses against Resolutions Nos. 144-2008, 145-2008 and 146-2008 and an action of *amparo* requesting protection against CNEE Resolution No. 3121. After its administrative recourses were rejected, EEGSA brought a second action for constitutional protection against Resolution No. 144-2008. While initially the courts of first instance granted protection against Resolution No. 144-2008 and CNEE Resolution No. 3121, subsequently those decisions were reversed on appeal before the Constitutional Court, by means of decisions dated 18 November 2009 and 24 February 2010. The Constitutional Court found that the Expert Commission\u2019s report was not binding on the CNEE and that the CNEE had caused no damage by dissolving the Expert Commission.\n\n50.\n\nOn 21 October 2010, the Consortium sold DECA II for USD 605 million to the Colombian firm EPM. TECO\u2019S share of the price for its 30 percent ownership was USD 181.5 million.\n\n51.\n\nIn Section V. of the Award, the Tribunal described the Parties\u2019 positions with respect to jurisdiction. Guatemala contended that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction over what it considered to be a simple regulatory disagreement on the interpretation of Guatemalan domestic law. Guatemala also argued that TECO could not use an international mechanism to file an appeal against the decisions of the Guatemalan courts and referred to the decision of the tribunal in the *Iberdrola* arbitration as support for its position. TECO countered that its claims concerned a violation of the CAFTA-DR and not of the Guatemalan regulatory framework, and that the decisions of the Guatemalan courts had no *res judicata* effect with respect to questions of international law. Finally, TECO disputed the relevance of the *Iberdrola* award to the question of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n52.\n\nIn Section VI. of the Award, the Tribunal proceeded to set out the Parties\u2019 positions with respect to the merits of the dispute. TECO argued that Guatemala had breached Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR by failing to give Fair and Equitable Treatment to its investment, when (i) it fundamentally modified the legal and regulatory framework for the investment, contrary to its representations and frustrated TECO\u2019S legitimate expectations, and (ii) when it engaged in unfair and arbitrary actions during the 2008-2013 tariff review process with the intent of controlling the process and its outcome. TECO requested compensation for (i) lost cash flow that its investment would have earned had EEGSA been able to collect the VAD to which it was entitled between 1 August 2008 and 21 October 2010, plus (ii) the difference between the actual market value of TECO\u2019S EEGSA shares in October 2010 with the VAD approved by the CNEE and the amount that its shares would have been worth had Guatemala not breached its Treaty obligations. TECO also requested pre- and post-award compounded interest at a rate of 8.8 percent.\n\n53.\n\nFor its part, Guatemala argued that the minimum standard of treatment under the CAFTA-DR did not cover TECO\u2019S claims, but only conduct which is a deliberate violation of the regulatory authority\u2019s obligations or an insufficiency of government action falling far below international standards. According to Guatemala, a violation of domestic law does not breach the international minimum standard of treatment unless it is a manifest and unjustified repudiation of a right and the victim did not have access to domestic courts. Since TECO had had access to the Guatemalan courts, it could only have brought a claim for denial of justice (which it did not do). Guatemala also contended that there had been no violation of TECO\u2019S legitimate expectations, as the regulatory framework under which TECO made its investment continued to be in effect, with the exception of some changes that were normal and expected. In any event, TECO did not benefit from a stability clause. Guatemala added that the amendments to the regulatory framework were justified and stressed that the CNEE was not bound by the pronouncements of the Expert Commission, whose role had ended upon the delivery of its report. Guatemala reaffirmed its position that both the role of the Expert Commission and the scope of its pronouncements were matters of interpretation of Guatemalan law, which had already been decided by the Constitutional Court of Guatemala. Guatemala denied that there had been any arbitrariness in the 2008 tariff review process and claimed that the CNEE\u2019s conduct was determined by the lack of credibility of the Bates White study. Guatemala maintained that the Expert Commission had ruled in favor of the CNEE in 56% of the discrepancies submitted to it and that, in any event, the 28 July 2008 Bates White study did not incorporate all the pronouncements of the Expert Commission. Guatemala also added that the Parties had never reached an agreement on who would be responsible for confirming whether the distributor\u2019s study reflected the opinions of the Expert Commission.\n\n54.\n\nWith respect to damages, Guatemala first argued that TECO had not suffered any loss. Guatemala also criticized TECO\u2019S expert\u2019s calculations and methods of valuation. With respect to the applicable interest rate on historical losses, Guatemala argued that it was necessary to actualize the presumed damages by the cash flow method from the date the damages occurred until 21 October 2010, and to apply an actualization factor based on EEGSA\u2019s cost of capital. Guatemala submitted that the latter was best represented by the WACC. With regard to the applicable interest rate on future losses, Guatemala argued that an actualization factor based on a risk free rate, such as US 10-year government bonds, would be appropriate.\n\n55.\n\nAfter setting out the Parties\u2019 respective requests for relief in Section VII. of the Award, the Tribunal proceeded with its analysis on jurisdiction and the merits in Section VIII.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction to hear the case. According to the Tribunal, the relevant test in this regard was the *prima facie* test of \"whether the facts alleged by the Claimant are capable, if proven, of constituting breaches of the Respondent\u2019s international obligations under CAFTA-DR\".7 Referring to several arbitral awards and authorities, the Tribunal found that \"the minimum standard of treatment of FET under Article 10.5 of CAFTA-DR is infringed by conduct attributed to the State and harmful to the investor if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\".8 Relying on these findings, the Tribunal determined that TECO\u2019S allegations and the evidence it adduced in this respect, were of such a nature that, if proved, they would establish a breach of Guatemala\u2019s obligations under the minimum standard.\n\nAward, at 444.\n\nAward, at 454.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal further found that the dispute before it was not a mere regulatory dispute under Guatemalan law, but an international dispute, where the Tribunal was called to apply international law in order to determine if Guatemala breached its obligations under the minimum standard of treatment. The Tribunal added that its task was not to review the findings made by Guatemalan courts, applying Guatemalan law, but rather to apply international law to the facts in dispute, including the content of Guatemalan law as interpreted by the Constitutional Court. In addition, the Tribunal found that there was no need for TECO to establish a denial of justice in order to find the State liable because TECO alleged having suffered a loss due to actions taken by the CNEE, and not by the Guatemalan judiciary. Finally, emphasizing the fact that its task was to resolve the dispute on the basis of the legal arguments and evidence presented before it, the Tribunal decided that it would not rely on the evidence presented in the *Iberdrola* arbitration, where the applicable treaties and the parties were different.\n\n58.\n\nOn the merits, the Tribunal found that the tariff review process was based upon two fundamental principles: (i) that, save in limited circumstances set by the regulatory framework, the tariff would be established based on a VAD study made by a consultant commissioned by the distributor; and (ii) that in case of disagreement between the distributor and the CNEE on the VAD study, a neutral Expert Commission would be called to pronounce itself. The Tribunal further found that Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions did not have any *res judicata* effect in the arbitration, as they involved different parties, different disputes and different applicable legal rules. However, the Tribunal did refer to the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions for the proper interpretation of the relevant provisions of Guatemalan law. In this respect, the Tribunal noted that the Constitutional Court had already determined with finality that, as a matter of Guatemalan law, the CNEE was not bound by the conclusions of the Expert Commission. The Tribunal found that, although the conclusions of the Expert Commission were not binding in the sense that it had no adjudicatory powers, the CNEE nevertheless had the duty to give them serious consideration and to provide valid reasons in case it decided to depart from them.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal further determined that the question of the investors\u2019 legitimate expectations was irrelevant because the State was found liable not for the alteration of the fundamental principles of the regulatory framework, but for their repudiation and for breach of due process in administrative matters.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal then addressed the regulator\u2019s conduct throughout the tariff review process. It first found that the regulator had continuous and intensive contacts with the distributor, but no operating rules were ever agreed between the regulator and the distributor. The Tribunal further found that the CNEE was entitled to dissolve the Expert Commission once its report had been submitted.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal further found that:\n\n\"664. [...] In the Arbitral Tribunal's view, in adopting Resolution No. 144-2008, in disregarding without providing reasons the Expert Commission's report, and in unilaterally imposing a tariff based on its own consultant's VAD calculation, the CNEE acted arbitrarily and in violation of fundamental principles of due process in regulatory matters.\n\n665. In so doing, the CNEE in fact repudiated two fundamental principles upon which the tariff review process regulatory framework is premised: the principle that, save in the limited exceptions provided by the LGE and the RLGE, the tariff would be based on a VAD calculation made by a prequalified consultant appointed by the distributor; and the principle that, in case of a disagreement between the regulator and the distributor, such disagreement would be resolved having regard to the conclusions of a neutral Expert Commission\".9\n\nAward, at 664-665.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that CNEE\u2019s Resolution No. 144-2008 was based on the distributor\u2019s failure to implement all of the regulator\u2019s observations as made in April 2008, irrespective of the fact that there was a disagreement on those observations and that the disagreement had been submitted to the Expert Commission. The CNEE had failed without giving any reasons to take into consideration the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that the regulator\u2019s decision to apply its own consultant study did not comport with Article 98 RLGE, which conditioned such a decision on a distributor\u2019s failure to correct its study in conformity with the pronouncements of the Expert Commission or on the regulator\u2019s providing valid reasons for departing from those pronouncements. In the case at hand, the regulator paid no regard and made no reference to the conclusions of the Expert Commission, which the Tribunal found to be arbitrary, in breach of the fundamental principles underpinning the regulatory framework and of the minimum standard of treatment in international law.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal further determined that there was nothing in the regulatory framework which obliged the CNEE to publish the tariff on the first day of the tariff period, 1 August 2008, and that the CNEE had until 1 May 2009 to publish the new tariff. On this basis the Tribunal concluded:\n\n\"687. In the Arbitral Tribunal's view, in accepting that the Expert Commission would deliver its report the week of July 24, 2008 (or even by mid June 2008), the CNEE also had to accept that it would not be able to seriously consider the experts' conclusions, correct the Bates White VAD study accordingly, and publish the tariff by August 1, 2008.\n\n688. By accepting to receive the Expert Commission's report in the week of July 24, 2008, to then disregard it along with the Bates White study on the basis that such date did not leave enough time to publish the tariff by August 1, 2008, the CNEE acted in breach of the fundamental principles of due process as well as in a contradictory and aberrant manner.\n\n689. Respondent acknowledges that it only conducted a \u2018preliminary review' of the revised July 28 Bates White's study and concluded that, because the models were not linked and did not allow \u2018quick verifications of the sources of efficient prices', it could not be amended \u2018within the two remaining days'.\n\n690. In the Arbitral Tribunal's view, both under the regulatory framework and under the minimum standard of treatment, the CNEE could and should have taken the time, after careful review of the Expert Commission's report, to implement its conclusions in the Bates White Study. The \u2018preliminary review' that the CNEE performed in less than one day was clearly insufficient to discharge that obligation. The Arbitral Tribunal can find no justification, other than its desire to reject the Bates White study in favor of the more favorable Sigla's study, for such a behavior.\"10\n\nAward, at 687-690.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that the regulator had no valid grounds for departing from the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements. The Tribunal dismissed Guatemala\u2019s argument that the Bates White 28 July study had failed to incorporate all the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements, pointing out that the regulator\u2019s decision to apply the Sigla study was not based on these grounds.\n\n66.\n\nIn Section IX. of the Award, the Tribunal scrutinized TECO\u2019S damages claim.\n\n67.\n\nWith respect to historical losses, the Tribunal awarded TECO the amount of USD 21,100,552, consisting of TECO\u2019S share of the higher revenues that EEGSA would have received had the CNEE observed due process in the tariff review, calculated from the moment the high revenues would have been first received until the moment TECO sold its share in EEGSA. The Tribunal quantified these losses in the \"but for\" scenario on the basis of the Bates White 28 July 2008 study, which reflected the tariffs that would have been applicable if the CNEE had complied with the regulatory framework.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected TECO\u2019S claim for loss of value (future losses). In doing so, the Tribunal first found that TECO\u2019S decision to divest was taken primarily as a consequence of the breach by the CNEE of the regulatory framework. However, the Tribunal added that it found \"no sufficient evidence of the existence and quantum of the losses that were allegedly suffered as a consequence of the sale\" and dismissed the claim.11\n\nAward, at 749.\n\n69.\n\nWith respect to interest, the Tribunal decided that it should only accrue from the date of the sale of EEGSA in October 2010, finding that \"because the... historical losses damages correspond[ed] to revenues that would have progressively flowed into EEGSA from August 2008 until October 2010\" and such amount had not been discounted to August 2008, \"calculating interest on the entire amount of the historical damages as from the first day of the tariff period would result in an unjustified enrichment of the Claimant\".12\n\nAward, at 765.\n\n70.\n\nPost-sale of EEGSA (from 21 October 2010 until full payment), the Tribunal applied a riskfree rate of pre- and post-award interest at the US Prime rate of interest, plus a 2 percent premium, compounded on an annual basis.\n\n71.\n\nIn Section **X.** of the Award, the Tribunal decided that Guatemala would support the entirety of its costs and reimburse 75% of the costs supported by TECO, i.e. USD 7,520,695.39.\n\n72.\n\nThe Committee will begin with a few remarks with regard to the nature of the annulment procedure (Section **IV.).** It will then analyze TECO\u2019S Application (Section **V.)** and Guatemala\u2019s Application (Section **VI.).** Following this, the Committee will make a determination as to the costs of these annulment proceedings (Section **VII.)** and will then set out its decision (Section **VIII.).** To the extent that the Parties\u2019 arguments are not referred to expressly here in this Decision, they must be deemed to be subsumed in the Committee\u2019s analysis.\n\n**IV. SOME REMARKS WITH REGARD TO ANNULMENT**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nWithin the carefully balanced system of remedies established by the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, annulment is concerned with ensuring the fundamental fairness and integrity of the underlying proceeding. As it has often been repeated, annulment is not an appeal and an annulment committee is not empowered to review the substantive correctness of the Award, either in fact or in law. An annulment committee may not, within the confines of an annulment proceeding, review the assessment of the factual record by a tribunal.13 An annulment committee\u2019s mandate is strictly circumscribed by the five grounds for annulment listed under the ICSID Convention and it may not, under the guise of applying them, reverse an award on the merits.\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide* v. *Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25), Decision on Annulment, 23 December 2010 (Exhibit RL-118) *(\"Fraport* v. *Philippines'\"),* at 84.\n\n74.\n\nIn the case before the Committee, both Parties have filed Applications for annulment and have invoked the following grounds for annulment:\n\n(i) Manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b));\n\n(ii) A serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and\n\n(iii) Failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n75.\n\nIn order to facilitate its analysis of the Parties\u2019 Applications, the Committee considers it useful to first make a few observations with respect to these grounds for annulment.\n\n**1.1 Manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b))**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThere are two issues to consider with regard to this ground for annulment: (i) what amounts to an excess of powers; and (ii) how to determine whether an excess of powers is manifest.\n\n77.\n\nWith regard to the first issue, the Committee finds that a tribunal commits an excess of powers: (i) if it goes beyond the parties\u2019 consent by either exercising jurisdiction it does not have or by failing to exercise a jurisdiction which it possesses; or (ii) if it fails to apply the law agreed by the parties. With regard to the second issue, the Committee considers that an excess of powers is \"manifest\" if it is plain on its face, evident, obvious, or clear.14 In the words of the *CDC* v. *Seychelles* annulment committee:\n\n\"[T]he term \u2018manifest' means clear or \u2018self-evident'. Thus, even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal's conduct, if susceptible of argument \u2018one way or the other', is not manifest. [...] \u2018If the issue is debatable or requires examination of the materials on which the tribunal's decision is based, the tribunal's determination is conclusive'.\"15 [emphasis added]\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki* v. *The United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of Mr. Soufraki, 5 June 2007 (Exhibit CL-N-132) (\" *Soufraki* v. *U.A.E. \"),* at 39.\n\n*CDC Group pic* v. *Republic of Seychelles* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14), Decision on Annulment, 29 June 2005 (Exhibit CL-N-128) (\"CDC v. Seychelles\"), at 41, citing with approval from M.B. Feldman, *The Annulment Proceedings and the Finality of ICSID Arbitral Awards, 2* ICSID REV. (1987).\n\n78.\n\nIn other words, in determining whether a tribunal has committed a manifest excess of powers, an annulment committee is not empowered to verify whether a tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional analysis or a tribunal\u2019s application of the law was correct, but only whether it was tenable as a matter of law. Even if a committee might have a different view on a debatable issue, it is simply not within its powers to correct a tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the law or assessment of the facts. In this respect, the Committee agrees with the *Lucchetti* v. *Peru* annulment committee:\n\n\"[T]he *Ad hoc* Committee does not consider it to be its task to determine whether the test employed by the Tribunal and the weight given by the Tribunal to various elements were \u2018right' or \u2018wrong'. In the Committee's view, treaty interpretation is not an exact science, and it is frequently the case that there is more than one possible interpretation of a disputed provision, sometimes even several. It is no part of the Committee's function... to purport to substitute its own view for that arrived at by the Tribunal. [...] The Committee is not charged with the task of determining whether one interpretation is \u2018better' than another, or indeed which among several interpretations might be considered the \u2018best' one. The Committee is concerned solely with the process by which the Tribunal moved from its premise to its conclusion.\"16\n\n*Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Per\u00fa, S.A.

Whether or not the tribunal made an error in the application of that law is beside the point:\n\n\"Regardless of our opinion of the correctness of the Tribunal's legal analysis, however, our inquiry is limited to a determination of whether or not the Tribunal endeavored to apply English law.\"18\n\nCDC v. Seychelles, at 45.\n\n**1.2 Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d))**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nA departure from a rule of procedure may lead to the annulment of an award only if the departure is serious and the rule of procedure that was not complied with is fundamental.\n\n82.\n\nThe Committee considers that the seriousness of a tribunal\u2019s failure to comply with a rule of procedure is properly determined using the criteria set out by the *MINE* v. *Guinea* annulment committee:\n\n\"In order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a \u2018fundamental rule of procedure' must be serious. The Committee considers that this establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\"19 [emphasis added]\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE)* v. *Government of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Decision on the Application by Guinea for Partial Annulment, 14 December 1989 (Exhibit RL-47) *(\"MINE* v. *Guinea\"),* at 5.05.\n\n83.\n\nThese criteria were confirmed and explained further by other annulment committees, such as *Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt:*\n\n\"In order to be a \u2018serious' departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.\"20\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd.* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on the Application by the Arab Republic of Egypt for Annulment of the Arbitral Award dated December 8, 2000, 5 February 2002 (Exhibit CL-N-144) (*\"Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt\")* at 58.\n\n84.\n\nThe *Victor Pey Casado* v. *Chile* annulment committee further explained:\n\n\"The applicant is not required to show that the result would have been different, that it would have won the case, if the rule had been respected. The Committee notes in fact that, in *Wena,* the committee stated that the applicant must demonstrate \u2018the impact that the issue may have had on the award'. The Committee agrees that this is precisely how the seriousness of the departure must be analyzed.\"21\n\n*Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation* v. *Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Republic of Chile. 18 December 2012 (Exhibit CL-N-143) *(\"Victor Pey Casado* v. *Chile\"),* at 78, citing with approval to Wena Hotels v.

Requiring an applicant to show that it would have won the case or that the result of the case would have been different if the rule of procedure had been respected is a highly speculative exercise. An annulment committee cannot determine with any degree of certainty whether any of these results would have occurred without placing itself in the shoes of a tribunal, something which is not within its powers to do. What a committee can determine however is whether the tribunal\u2019s compliance with a rule of procedure could potentially have affected the award.\n\n86.\n\nThere is some debate between the Parties with respect to the rules of procedure which may qualify as \"fundamental\" under the terms of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. For purposes of this introduction the Committee will simply note that only rules of natural justice, which concern the fairness of the arbitration proceedings, may be considered as fundamental.22\n\n*CDC* v. *Seychelles,* at 49.\n\n**1.3 Failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e))**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIt is the view of this Committee that annulment of an award for failure to state reasons can only occur when a tribunal has failed to set out the considerations which underpinned its decision in a manner that can be understood and followed by a reader. Article 52(1)(e) may not be used so as to obtain the reversal on the merits of an award for allegedly providing incorrect or unconvincing reasons. According to the *MINE* v. *Guinea* annulment committee:\n\n\"The Committee is of the opinion that the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph (1)(e), because it almost inevitably draws an *ad hoc* Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal's decision. [...] In the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.\"23\n\n*MINE* v. *Guinea,* at 5.08, 5.09.\n\n88.\n\nAccording to the *Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt* annulment committee, the requirement to state reasons is based \"on the Tribunal\u2019s duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision\"24. Moreover, not all of a tribunal\u2019s reasons need to be set out explicitly, as long as they can be understood from the rest of the award:\n\n\"Neither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specify the manner in which the Tribunal's reasons are to be stated. The object of both provisions is to ensure that the Parties will be able to understand the Tribunal's reasoning. This goal does not require that each reason be stated expressly. The tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision.\"25 [emphasis added]\n\n*Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt,* at 79.\n\n*Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt,* at 81.\n\n89.\n\nAs long as the standard set out above is satisfied an arbitral tribunal must be allowed a certain degree of discretion with regard to the manner in which it chooses to state its reasoning. In the words of the *Vivendi I* annulment committee:\n\n\"Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. It bears reiterating that an *ad hoc* committee is not a court of appeal. Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.\"26\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002 (Exhibit RL-50) *(\"Vivendi I v. Argentina\"),* at 64.\n\n90.\n\nWhile a committee may not opine on the correctness or persuasiveness of an award, contradictory reasons may justify annulment. However, one must not be quick to assume that a tribunal\u2019s reasons are truly contradictory:\n\n\"It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal's reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.\"27\n\n*Vivendi 1* v. *Argentina,* at 65.\n\n91.\n\nHaving set out these fundamental principles with respect to annulment, the Committee will now proceed with the analysis of TECO\u2019S (Section **V.)** and Guatemala\u2019s Applications (Section **VI.).**\n\n**V. TECO\u2019S APPLICATION**\n-------------------------\n\n**1.1 Failure to state reasons: the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning for denying TECO damages for loss of value cannot be reconciled with its other findings (Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.1.1 TECO \u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n92.\n\nAccording to TECO, an award may be annulled for failure to state reasons if a reader of the award is unable to understand how the tribunal arrived at its conclusions. Relying upon the *Soufraki* v. *U.A.E,* annulment decision, TECO argues that, even short of a total failure to state reasons, some defects in the statement of reasons could give rise to annulment and that insufficient or inadequate reasons as well as contradictory reasons - which cancel each other out - are also valid grounds for annulment.28\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 85-88.\n\n93.\n\nTECO does not agree with Guatemala\u2019s argument that an award may be annulled for failure to state reasons only in the most extreme cases of contradictory reasoning. However, it is TECO\u2019S position that even under this standard the Award\u2019s reasoning on the loss of value claim does not meet the requirements of the ICSID Convention.29\n\nTECO\u2019S Reply, at 61.\n\n94.\n\nIn this respect, TECO argues that there is a contradiction between, on the one hand, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that there was no sufficient evidence that, had EEGSA\u2019s tariffs been higher, the transaction price would have reflected the higher revenues until 2013, and on the other hand, the Tribunal\u2019s other findings such as: (i) the VAD constitutes a Guatemalan electricity distribution company\u2019s sole source of profit and drives that company\u2019s fair market value; (ii) EPM paid fair market value for EEGSA and the 2008-2013 tariffs were taken into account in fixing the price of the transaction; (iii) EEGSA\u2019s tariffs for the entire 2008-2013 tariff period would have been based upon the 28 July 2008 Bates White study; (iv) by imposing the Sigla VAD upon EEGSA, the CNEE reduced EEGSA\u2019s VAD by more than 45 percent and its revenue by 40 percent; (v) EEGSA\u2019s revenues and profits for the 2008-2013 period would have been higher but for Guatemala\u2019s breach; and (vi) Guatemala\u2019s breach gave rise to damages in excess of USD 21 million while TECO held its investment in EEGSA.30\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 92-94; TECO\u2019S Reply at 64-66.\n\n95.\n\nIn TECO\u2019S view, the Tribunal\u2019s finding that EEGSA\u2019s tariffs and revenues would have been higher had it not been for Guatemala\u2019s breach necessarily implies that, if TECO had not sold its interest in EEGSA in October 2010, it would have been entitled to its share of the resulting additional profits.31\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 90-91;\n\n96.\n\nIn response to Guatemala\u2019s argument that the Tribunal could not have awarded damages for future losses because the measures which caused the loss would have ceased to be in effect beyond 2013, TECO argues that its damages claim depended only upon EPM\u2019s valuation of the company as of the date of the sale, and not upon the actual evolution of the VAD and/or tariffs subsequent to the sale32.\n\nTECO\u2019S Reply, at 67-68.\n\n97.\n\nIn TECO\u2019S view, the above evidences a manifest logical inconsistency in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, which warrants the annulment of the Award.\n\n*1.1.2 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n98.\n\nGuatemala argues that contradictory reasoning may only give rise to annulment in the rare cases of reasons which cancel each other out completely and therefore amount to a total absence of reasons. Referring to *Rumeli* v. *Kazakhstan, MTD* v. *Chile,33 Malicorp* v. *Egypt34* and *Daimler* v. *Argentina35* among others, Guatemala contends that the standard for annulment for contradictory reasons is high. Mere conflicting considerations in an award are insufficient, and annulment committees must strive to interpret awards in ways which confirms their consistency rather than their inner contradictions.36\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S..I.* v. *Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on Annulment, 21 March 2007 (Exhibit RL-55) (*\"MTD* v. *Chile \").*\n\n*Malicorp Limited* v. *The Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18), Decision on the Application for Annulment of Malicorp Limited, 3 July 2013 (Exhibit RL-48) *(\"Malicorp* v. *Egypt\").*\n\n*Daimler Financial Services AG* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1), Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015 (Exhibit RL-115) *(\"Daimler* v. *Argentina\")*.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 80; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 65-68.\n\n99.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, there are no contradictions in the Award and the Tribunal\u2019s findings can be reconciled perfectly. Up until October 2010, TECO claimed losses based on lost tariff revenue, whereas the losses claimed between 2010 and 2013 and from 2013 onwards were based on an alleged diminished value at which TECO sold its participation in EEGSA. Guatemala\u2019s view is that the Tribunal was justified in treating these claims differently. According to Guatemala, TECO had failed to provide evidence that would have ascertained how the sale price was determined, what other factors apart from the 2008 tariffs may have influenced the sale price, and whether the price would have increased with higher tariffs and by how much - evidence that the Tribunal had repeatedly requested. Guatemala considers that the Tribunal was entitled to find that, because TECO received a substantial amount for the sale of its shares in EEGSA and because it had failed to produce the evidence above, it could not ascertain whether and to what extent TECO actually incurred a loss. With regard to the period from 2013 onwards, since those tariffs would have been replaced by new tariffs every five years, Guatemala claims it would have been absurd for the Tribunal to find Guatemala liable on the basis of the 2008 tariffs.37\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 79-85.\n\n100.\n\nGuatemala further argues that the findings TECO attributes to the Tribunal (that EEGSA\u2019s fair market value depended on its VAD, that EPM had paid fair market value for EEGSA and that, absent Guatemala\u2019s breach, EEGSA\u2019s VAD for the entire 2008-2013 tariff period would have been higher) cannot in fact be found in the Award itself. Guatemala points out that the Tribunal had no evidence in the record of how the transaction price had actually been determined or what factors had come into play in that calculation.38\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 70-75.\n\n*1.1.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n---------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nOn a preliminary note, the Committee would like to reiterate its earlier finding that, while truly contradictory reasons within an award justify annulment, a committee should first attempt to determine whether an apparent contradiction is nothing more than a tribunal\u2019s effort to accommodate conflicting considerations.39\n\n*Vivendi 1* v. *Argentina,* at 65.\n\n102.\n\nIn addition, if possible, an annulment committee should prefer an interpretation which confirms an award\u2019s consistency as opposed to its inner contradictions:\n\n\"In construing awards, as in construing statutes and legal instruments generally, one necessarily should construe the language in issue, whenever possible, in a way that results in consistency [...].\"40\n\n*CDC* v. *Seychelles,* at 81.\n\n103.\n\nAfter a careful analysis of the Parties\u2019 arguments and of the record, the Committee cannot discern any genuine contradiction within the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the loss of value claim. The Committee therefore finds that annulment for this reason is not warranted. Explanations follow below.\n\n104.\n\nThe Committee observes that the Tribunal\u2019s finding reads as follows:\n\n\"[E]xisting tariffs were considered as a relevant factor in determining the price of the transaction. There is however no sufficient evidence that, had the 2008-2013 tariffs been higher, the transaction price would have reflected the higher revenues of the company until 2013. The interview of Mr. Restrepo only mentions as a \u2018possibility' that with a higher VAD for the rest of the tariff period, the transaction price would have been higher. And there [sic] no evidence in the record of how the transaction price has been determined. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore ignores what other factors might have come into play and cannot conclude with sufficient certainty that an increase in revenues until 2013 would have been reflected in the purchase price and to what extent.\"41 [emphasis added]\n\nAward, at 754.\n\n105.\n\nIn other words, the Tribunal found that it could not conclude \"with sufficient certainty\" that an increase in revenues until 2013 would have been reflected in the purchase price and to what extent because it did not have evidence on what other factors, in addition to the existing tariffs, had been taken into account by the seller and the purchaser when they agreed on the price of the transaction. The Tribunal explicitly stated in this respect that there was \"no evidence in the record of how the transaction price [had] been determined\".42\n\nThe Committee will limit its analysis here to determining whether there is a contradiction warranting annulment within the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning. The Committee will address TECO\u2019S other arguments raised under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention under their corresponding sections within this Decision.\n\n106.\n\nThe Committee finds no contradiction within the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning. The Tribunal never found that an increase in revenues due to higher tariffs would not have resulted in an increase in the transaction price, as TECO appears to believe. The Tribunal dismissed the loss of value claim on evidentiary grounds. The Tribunal stated that it had no evidence on how the transaction price had been determined and that it could not be certain that an increase in revenues \"would have been reflected in the purchase price and to what extent\".\n\n107.\n\nEqually, the Committee finds no contradiction between, on the one hand, the Tribunal\u2019s decision awarding TECO historical damages, and, on the other hand, the Tribunal holding that it could not award future losses because it had not been presented with sufficient evidence to determine whether TECO had suffered a loss of value and its amount. Indeed, the two situations, although similar, are distinguished by the fact that the loss of value claim depended on the sale price of EEGSA, while the historical damages claim did not. This was not contested by the Parties and was explicitly stated within the Award.43 Because the Tribunal found that it had not been presented with evidence on how the sale price of EEGSA had been determined, the loss of value claim was dismissed.\n\nAward, at 719.\n\n108.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee considers that annulment of the Award on this ground is not warranted.\n\n**1.2 Failure to state reasons: the Tribunal disregarded the extensive documentary and expert evidence on loss of value (Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.2.1 TECO \u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n109.\n\nTECO argues that, in dismissing its claim for loss of value on the grounds of insufficient evidence, the Tribunal ignored the extensive expert and documentary evidence the Parties had adduced precisely on this matter. According to TECO, the lack of consideration to this evidence in the damages analysis stands in contrast to the Tribunal\u2019s multiple references to it in the previous sections of the Award. Moreover, the Tribunal also failed to explain why portions of Mr. Restrepo\u2019s interview upon which it relied prevailed over expert and documentary evidence or indeed over other parts of the same interview which supported TECO\u2019S position that EPM would have paid a higher purchase price, had EEGSA\u2019s VAD and tariffs been set at a higher rate in the 2008-2013 tariff review.44\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 96-97, 106-107; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 72-73, 82.\n\n110.\n\nTECO submits that it is not criticizing the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the admissibility or probative value of the evidence on the record, as argued by Guatemala. Therefore, the decision of the annulment committee in *Rumeli* v. *Kazakhstan,* holding that a tribunal is not required to explain its treatment of each piece of evidence adduced by the parties, is inapposite. Rather, TECO is contending that the Tribunal ignored extensive evidence that addressed the issues before it without providing any reasons for doing so.45\n\nTECO\u2019S Reply, at 72, 76-78.\n\n111.\n\nMore precisely, TECO submits that, contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that there was no evidence in the record of how the transaction price had been determined, the record in fact contained documentary evidence reflecting that information. In its view, the Tribunal failed to address, without providing any explanation, the following evidence:\n\n(i) EPM\u2019s non-binding offer letter to Iberdrola, which explained the methodologies used by EPM and its advisor to calculate EPM\u2019s proposed transaction price;\n\n(ii) the 14 October 2010 Citibank Fairness Opinion, where Citibank analyzed the fairness to TECO of EPM\u2019s price offer of USD 605 million, the price at which the shares in DECA II were ultimately sold to EPM; and\n\n(iii) the expert reports of the Parties\u2019 experts, Mr. Kaczmarek and Dr. Abdala.46\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 98-105.\n\n112.\n\nAccording to TECO, the EPM non-binding offer confirmed that the methodologies EPM used to calculate the offered transaction price did not assume an increase in tariffs for the years 2013 and 2014. In a similar fashion, the Citibank Fairness Opinion explained that the projections assumed that the CNEE would not institute any change in EEGSA\u2019s VAD tariff in 2013. TECO submits that this was contemporaneous evidence demonstrating how the purchase price by EPM was calculated, something which the Tribunal found the record to be lacking.47\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 98-100; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 79-80.\n\n113.\n\nIn reply to Guatemala\u2019s argument that the Citigroup Fairness Opinion referred to DECA II globally, TECO explains that Citigroup had conducted a DCF analysis specifically of EEGSA, in which it projected its cash flows for ten years into the future based on the assumption that the CNEE would not institute any change in EEGSA\u2019s VAD tariff in 2013. TECO insists that this evidence was brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention at the hearing and in the written submissions.48\n\nTECO\u2019S Reply, at 81.\n\n114.\n\nTECO also notes that both Parties\u2019 quantum experts had agreed in their reports that TECO\u2019S damages for loss of value should be calculated as the difference between the actual value of EEGSA and the *but for* value of EEGSA. TECO explains that, because the purchase price for DECA II covered a portfolio of companies and did not assign a value to each particular company, including EEGSA, Mr. Kaczmarek calculated EEGSA\u2019s actual value as of the sale by applying three accepted valuation approaches: the DCF method, the comparable publicly traded company method, and the comparable transaction method, and weighted the results of the three methods. TECO acknowledges that Mr. Kaczmarek projected EEGSA\u2019s cash flows until 2018 based on the assumption that the CNEE would continue to calculate the VAD by reference to a VNR that was depreciated by 50%. However, TECO adds that the value calculated by Mr. Kaczmarek was within the range of values determined by Guatemala\u2019s expert Dr. Abdala as corresponding to EEGSA\u2019s actual value. According to TECO, the Tribunal ignored this agreement of the Parties\u2019 experts and failed to explain why it concluded that there was no evidence of how the transaction price had been determined or that the valuation of the company reflected the assumption that tariffs would remain unchanged.49\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 101-103.\n\n115.\n\nTECO further contends that, contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s findings, it never argued that the valuation of EEGSA reflected the assumption that its tariffs would remain unchanged beyond 2013 and forever. Instead, TECO submits that its expert assumed that CNEE would continue to calculate the VAD based on a VNR depreciated by 50 percent for the period 2013-2018, and then assigned a terminal value to EEGSA. TECO also adds that, contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that there was no information on the record regarding the establishment of the 2013-2018 tariffs, the record in fact included the 2013-2018 Terms of Reference, which set forth the same calculation as the one imposed during the 2008-2013 tariff review. The Tribunal therefore ignored this evidence entirely.50\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 104-105; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 74-75.\n\n116.\n\nFinally, TECO submits that the Tribunal failed to address its explanation that its loss of value claim did not depend upon knowing what would happen to the tariffs in the future, but only on a showing that, as of October 2010, a purchaser of EEGSA would project lower future revenues and would pay less for the company.51\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 108.\n\n*1.2.2 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n117.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, as a matter of principle, an ICSID tribunal\u2019s treatment of the evidence on the record is within its discretion and beyond the scope of annulment. Referring to *Rumeli* v. *Kazakhstan52* Guatemala argues that a tribunal is not under an obligation to refer to all the pieces of evidence on the record or to provide reasons for relying on one piece of evidence rather than another. It is in a tribunal\u2019s discretion to form an opinion about the relevance and materiality of the evidence presented by the parties. In Guatemala\u2019s view, the only requirement under the ICSID Convention is that an award be reasoned so that a reader can comprehend the conclusions of the tribunal and how it arrived at them. There is no requirement that the reasoning be adequate, convincing or even correct.53 Otherwise, an annulment committee would need to review the entire record presented to the tribunal, assess the evidence *de novo* and second-guess the tribunal\u2019s decision. Guatemala considers that such an approach would transform annulment into appeal.54\n\n*Rumeli* v. *Kazakhstan.*\n\nGuatemala refers in this respect to *Caratube International Oil Company LLP* v. *Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12), Decision on the Annulment Application of Caratube International Oil Company LLP, 21 February 2014 (Exhibits RL-52, CL-N-127) *(\"Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan\"); Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly* *Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, 30 July 2010 (Exhibit RL-117) *(\"Enron* v. *Argentina); and MINE v. Guinea.*\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 87-94; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 76-85.\n\n118.\n\nGuatemala argues that none of the reasons invoked by TECO with respect to this ground for annulment are valid. According to Guatemala, the Tribunal\u2019s reasons for rejecting the loss of value claim were correct, but even if they were not, the Award provided reasons: the lack of evidence on damages. This is enough to satisfy the requirements of the ICSID Convention.55\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 86.\n\n119.\n\nIn the alternative, Guatemala argues that the Tribunal\u2019s decision to afford greater weight to certain evidence was correct and justified.\n\n120.\n\nBecause TECO based its loss of value claim on the price at which it sold its participation in EEGSA, TECO needed to prove that the price included a loss. Guatemala contends that, despite multiple requests from itself or the Tribunal, TECO failed to produce even one piece of evidence contemporary to the sale attesting to the price at which EEGSA was sold or how such price had been determined. During the document production phase of the proceedings and subsequent to a Tribunal order to produce, TECO disclosed two documents: EPM\u2019s Non-Binding Offer Letter and Citibank\u2019s Fairness Opinion. Guatemala argues that TECO only referred to these documents a few times in the arbitration and did not rely upon them to show that the purchase price was determined solely on the basis of the 2008 tariffs or to demonstrate how the purchase price would have been influenced by higher tariffs. In addition, the EPM Non-Binding Offer Letter indicated no purchase price for EEGSA.56\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 95-100; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 87-92.\n\n121.\n\nGuatemala adds that, contrary to its submissions in these annulment proceedings, TECO had numerous opportunities to address Mr. Restrepo\u2019s press interview. This evidence was submitted together with Guatemala\u2019s first pleading in the original arbitration, the Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility and Counter-Memorial on the Merits. Moreover, the Tribunal gave the Parties ample warning about the fact that it viewed the questions of the actual sale price of EEGSA, the calculation behind it and the extent to which it relied upon the 2008 tariffs as material. In particular, the Tribunal asked the Parties questions concerning these issues and Mr. Restrepo\u2019s interview twice during the hearing. Guatemala considers that TECO could not have been taken by surprise when the Tribunal referenced the interview in its Award. In any event, the Tribunal\u2019s decision to not award TECO damages for loss of value was not based on Mr. Restrepo\u2019s interview alone, but rather Mr. Restrepo\u2019s interview was an example of the absence of evidence regarding the longterm impact of the tariffs.57\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 93-97.\n\n122.\n\nFurther, Guatemala does not agree with TECO\u2019S contention that the Tribunal ignored the reports of the Parties\u2019 quantum experts. According to Guatemala, the Tribunal referred to their reports in 72 paragraphs of the Award, and it referred in multiple instances to other expert reports, witness statements, documentary evidence and to the hearing transcript. However, the Parties\u2019 quantum experts\u2019 reports could not provide contemporaneous evidence regarding how EPM had calculated the price of EEGSA, evidence which was requested by the Tribunal. Guatemala adds that, in any event, absence of references to evidence is not a ground for annulment, as the Tribunal had already reviewed the evidence before it and had summarized it in an earlier section of the Award. The Tribunal simply wanted evidence that was contemporaneous to the sale in order to understand why it should adopt the sale price as evidence of the loss. Justifiably, the Tribunal found this evidence to be missing.58\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 103-105; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 98-100.\n\n*1.2.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n---------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nOna preliminary note, the Committee considers it useful to first set out the principles which have guided its analysis under this ground for annulment.\n\n124.\n\nFirst, the Committee reiterates that annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is only warranted when a tribunal has failed to discharge its duty to render an award that allows readers to comprehend and follow its reasoning.59 As long as an award meets this standard, annulment will not be warranted, even if the tribunal made a mistake of fact or law in the process. A tribunal\u2019s reasoning need not be explicit in every respect, as long as the reasons can be understood from the rest of the award:\n\n\"[I]f reasons are not stated but are evident and a logical consequence of what is stated in an award, an *ad hoc* committee should be able to so hold. Conversely, if such reasons do not necessarily follow or flow from the award's reasoning, an *ad hoc* committee should not construct reasons in order to justify the decision of the tribunal.\"60\n\n*Alapti Elektrik BV* v. *Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/13), Decision on Annulment, 10 July 2014 (Exhibit RL-51) *(Alapli* v. *Turkey\"),* at 197.\n\n*Rumeli* v. *Kazakhstan,* at 83.\n\n125.\n\nSecond, the Committee aligns itself with the view of other annulment committees which have held that, in order to discharge its duty to provide reasons for its decision, a tribunal is not under an obligation to address every piece of evidence in the record or every single argument made by the parties. In the words of the *Tza Yap Shum* v. *Peru* annulment committee:\n\n\"Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention does not require than an arbitral tribunal explains itself in respect of each piece of evidence adduced by either party which is not outcome determinative or to give reasons for preferring some evidence over other evidence. Rather, the award has to enable the reader to see the reasons upon which the award itself is based. [...]\n\n[T]he obligation to provide reasons does not require that a detailed answer be given to each of the parties' arguments.\"61\n\n*Se\u00f1or Tza Yap Shum* v. *Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6), Decision on Annulment, 12 February 2015 (Exhibit RL-132) *(fTza Yap Shum* v. *Peru\"),* at 110, 119; *See* also, *Rumeli* v. *Kazakhstan,* at 104; *Enron* v. *Argentina.* at 222.\n\n126.\n\nThird, it is not the role of an annulment committee to conduct a re-evaluation of the record before the tribunal. Pursuant to Arbitration Rule 34(1), a tribunal is the judge of the admissibility and probative value of any evidence adduced before it.\n\n127.\n\nBearing in mind these fundamental principles and having carefully examined the Award and the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Committee considers that the Award\u2019s decision on the loss of value claim does not meet the standards set out by Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention and needs to be annulled on this ground.\n\n128.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on the loss of value claim is not clear at all, such that the Committee, despite having had the benefit of the Parties\u2019 submissions and of the entire record before it, has struggled to understand the Tribunal\u2019s line of reasoning. In TECO\u2019S words,\n\n\"[O]ne cannot \u2018follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion' with respect to its decision not to award TECO any damages for its loss upon the sale of its shares in EEGSA.\" [internal citations omitted]62\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 97.\n\n129.\n\nThe Committee will explain below why this is the case.\n\n130.\n\nFirst, despite the fact that it was deciding a claim for loss of value, the Tribunal did not discuss *at all* the Parties\u2019 respective expert reports either on the actual or the *but for* value of EEGSA. The Tribunal simply limited itself to mentioning the differing values which the Parties\u2019 experts calculated for the two scenarios and concluding that there was \"no *sufficient evidence* that, had the 2008-2013 tariffs been higher, the transaction price would have reflected the higher revenues of the company until 2013\" [emphasis added].63 The Tribunal did not specify why it found the four expert reports submitted by the Parties, which amounted to about 1200 pages of analysis, and why the calculations put forward by the Parties, which were in dispute, were deemed unsatisfactory and amounted to \"no sufficient evidence\".\n\nAward, at 754.\n\n131.\n\nThe Committee wishes to clarify that it is making no finding or observation with regard to the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the expert testimony. It was within the Tribunal\u2019s discretion to assess whether that testimony was relevant or not, material or not, and that view is not censorable on annulment. However, that is not what is at stake here. The Committee takes issue with the complete absence of any discussion of the Parties\u2019 expert reports within the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the loss of value claim. While the Committee accepts that a tribunal cannot be required to address within its award each and every piece of evidence in the record, that cannot be construed to mean that a tribunal can simply gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis, without any analysis and without explaining why it found that evidence insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory. A tribunal is duty bound to the parties to at least address those pieces of evidence that the parties deem to be highly relevant to their case and, if it finds them to be of no assistance, to set out the reasons for this conclusion.\n\n132.\n\nThe Committee is not persuaded by Guatemala\u2019s argument that it was sufficient that the Tribunal summarized the contents of the expert reports and purportedly analyzed them in 72 paragraphs of the Award. What matters for present purposes is that the Tribunal failed to address in any way the expert testimonies within its analysis on the loss of value claim, despite the fact that those testimonies directly pertained to this issue and that the Parties considered them to be highly relevant.\n\n133.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal failed to explain why it considered that the record contained \"no evidence... of how the transaction price has been determined\"64 when in actuality the record included both EPM\u2019s Non-Binding Offer Letter and Citibank\u2019s Fairness Opinion, which related to this issue even according to Guatemala.65 The Committee wishes to again stress that it is not addressing the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the record before it, something which is not within its powers to do. The Committee cannot and will not make any finding with respect to the relevance or otherwise of these two pieces of evidence. The Committee limits itself to observing that, contrary to the Award\u2019s explicit holding, evidence on the issue existed. And while the Tribunal was within its right to hold that this evidence was unpersuasive, immaterial, or insufficient, it did not make any such finding, but one of nonexistence. Taking the Tribunal\u2019s words at face value, the Committee can only conclude that the Tribunal ignored this evidence.\n\nAward, at 754.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 89.\n\n134.\n\nThird, and in a similar vein, the Award found that \"no information has been provided to the Arbitral Tribunal regarding the establishment of the 2013-2018 tariffs\".66 However, it is undisputed that the record included information on this matter, namely the 2013-2018 Terms of Reference.\n\nAward, at 758.\n\n135.\n\nThe Committee wishes to point out that it cannot determine whether the evidence that was ignored by the Tribunal would have had an impact on the Award or not. What can be ascertained at the annulment stage is that the Tribunal failed to observe evidence which at least had the potential to be relevant to the final outcome of the case.\n\n136.\n\nDue to the Award\u2019s lack of analysis of the above mentioned evidence and in spite of having had the benefit of the Parties\u2019 submissions and of the entire annulment record before it, the Committee could not understand the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on the loss of value claim and whether the Tribunal dismissed it because it could not determine the actual value of EEGSA or its *but for* value.\n\n137.\n\nIndeed, the Award did not endeavor to determine either. The Tribunal mentioned at paragraph 750 of the Award that the Parties were in slight disagreement over EEGSA\u2019s actual value, with each Party\u2019s experts putting forward loosely different figures. At paragraph 751 the Tribunal observed that the Parties\u2019 positions on EEGSA\u2019s *but for* value differed substantially and set them out. The Tribunal then went on to say that, while it accepted that existing tariffs were taken into account in fixing the price of EEGSA\u2019s sale, there was \"no sufficient evidence that, had the 2008-2013 tariffs been higher, the transaction price would have reflected the higher revenues of the company until 2013\".67 While making this observation with regard to EEGSA\u2019s *but for* value, the Tribunal added that there was \"no evidence in the record of how the transaction price [had] been determined\" and that, as a result, it could not \"conclude with sufficient certainty that an increase in revenues until 2013 would have been reflected in the purchase price and to what extent\".68 The Committee is inclined to think that the Tribunal dismissed the loss of value claim because EEGSA\u2019s *but for* value could not be determined with sufficient certainty. However, in light of the fact that the Tribunal made no attempt to calculate the company\u2019s actual value and of its statement that it possessed no information on how the price had been determined, the Committee cannot be certain that this is the case. The Committee is therefore left guessing as to the Tribunal\u2019s actual line of reasoning, which cannot be ascertained from the rest of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis either.\n\nAward, at 752-754.\n\nAward, at 754.\n\n138.\n\nThe Committee therefore finds that the Tribunal failed to address in any way the Parties\u2019 expert reports on the loss of value claim despite the Parties\u2019 strong emphasis on expert evidence, and ignored the existence in the record of evidence which at least appeared to be relevant to its analysis. This resulted in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on the loss of value claim being difficult to understand. Based on these cumulative grounds, the Committee finds that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the loss of value claim does not satisfy the reasoning requirements of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention and should therefore be annulled.\n\n139.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Committee does not consider it necessary to make any further remarks with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of Mr. Restrepo\u2019s press interview.\n\n**1.3 Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure: the Tribunal imposed an unreasonable evidentiary burden upon TECO (Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.3.1 TECO \u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n140.\n\nTECO accuses the Tribunal of departing from the following rules of procedure: (i) the equal treatment of the parties; (ii) the principle that no one can be allowed to take advantage of their own wrong; (iii) the principle that the respondent cannot be permitted to benefit from evidentiary difficulties caused by its own wrongs; (iv) the principle that the requirement of proof must not be impossible to discharge; and (v) the principle that the claimant cannot be required to prove the existence and extent of its damage with absolute certainty.69\n\nTECO\u2019S Reply, at 94.\n\n141.\n\nIn support of its position that Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention is also applicable to the tribunal\u2019s treatment of evidence and burden of proof, TECO invokes the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Klockner II* v. *Cameroon70* and ICSID\u2019s Background Paper on Annulment71. While acknowledging that the *Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt* annulment committee remarked that a departure from a rule of procedure is serious only if it has caused the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would otherwise have awarded, TECO also quotes from the *Victor Pey Casado* v. *Chile* annulment decision, where the *ad hoc* committee indicated that an annulment applicant is not required to prove that the tribunal would necessarily have changed its conclusion if the rule had been observed.72\n\nExhibit CL-N-135.\n\nExhibit CL-N-147.\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 81-84; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 88-89.\n\n142.\n\nInvoking *Gemplus* v. *Mexico73* and *Sapphire* v. *National Iranian Oil74* TECO further argues that, when a respondent has committed a legal wrong causing loss to a claimant, the respondent is not entitled to invoke the burden of proof as to the amount of compensation for such a loss to the extent that this would compound the respondent\u2019s wrongs and unfairly defeat the claimant\u2019s claim for compensation. According to TECO, when confronted with evidentiary difficulties created by a respondent\u2019s own wrongs, a tribunal need only be satisfied on a balance of probabilities and should not require precise proof of the extent of the damage sustained by the claimant.75\n\n*Gemplus, S.A., SLP, SA. and Gemplus Industrial, S.A. de C.V.* v. *United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3 & ARB(AF)/04/4), Award, 16 June 2010 (Exhibit CL-22) *(\"Gemplus v. Mexico\").*\n\n*Sapphire Int\u2019l Petroleum, Ltd.* v. *National Iranian Oil Co.,* Arbitral Judgment of 15 March 1963 (Exhibit CL-N-141) (\" *Sapphire* v. *National Iranian Oilj.*\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 110-111, quoting Gemplus v. Mexico; *IoannisKardassopoulous* v. *Georgia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18, Award of 3 March 2010 *(\"Kardassopoulous* v. *Georgia\"),* (Exhibit CL-121); *Impregilo S.p.A.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17), Award of 21 June 2011 *(\"Impregilo* v. *Argentina\")* (Exhibit CL-N-134); TECO\u2019S Reply, at 90.\n\n143.\n\nSpecifically, TECO contends that the Tribunal imposed upon it an evidentiary burden so onerous that it could not have discharged it. It appears from the Award that the only evidence that would have satisfied the Tribunal would have been evidence from the third-party purchaser (EPM) regarding the manner in which it calculated the purchase price. TECO argues that this evidence was confidential, proprietary business information of the third-party purchaser and thus outside of its control. Moreover, such evidence was unlikely to exist, as the third party purchaser would not have calculated the purchase price for the hypothetical scenario in which Guatemala had not committed a breach. Nevertheless, the Tribunal ordered TECO to produce such evidence and penalized it when it failed to comply.76\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 112-113; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 91-92.\n\n144.\n\nTECO adds that the Tribunal also penalized TECO for selling its interest in EEGSA during the tariff period and rewarded Guatemala for the evidentiary difficulties caused by its breach, thus seriously departing from the principle of equal treatment of the parties and the principle that no one can take advantage of its own wrong. TECO considers that this departure is evidenced by the Tribunal\u2019s findings, on the one hand, that TECO was entitled to damages consisting of lost revenues before the sale of its interest in EEGSA and that the sale of EEGSA was a consequence of Guatemala\u2019s breach, and, on the other hand, that there was no sufficient evidence that EEGSA\u2019s lost revenues during the remainder of the 2008-2013 tariff period reduced EEGSA\u2019s fair market value in the sale.77\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 114-115; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 93.\n\n145.\n\nTECO contends that these departures were serious, in that they resulted in the dismissal of TECO\u2019S loss of value claim.\n\n*1.3.2 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n146.\n\nGuatemala considers that there is no fundamental rule of procedure which addresses the treatment of evidence or the standard of proof. Numerous arbitral awards have found that the rules of evidence are not strict or technical, and that a tribunal should have a large measure of discretion when it comes to standard of proof. In Guatemala\u2019s view, TECO cannot point to a single annulment decision to the contrary.78\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 113-115; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 105-108, referring to *Unglaube* v. *Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/1), Award, 16 May 2012 (Exhibit RL-120)*; Alpha Projektholding* v. *Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16), Award, 8 November 2010 (Exhibit RL-121); and *The Rompetrol Group N.V.* v. *Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3), Award, 6 May 2013 *(\"Rompetrol v. Romania\")* (Exhibit RL-123).\n\n147.\n\nIn any event, Guatemala disputes that the Tribunal imposed an insurmountable burden of proof upon TECO or that Guatemala created any evidentiary difficulties or took advantage of its own wrong.\n\n148.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, it is a well-established principle of international law that speculative or uncertain damages cannot be awarded. Referring to *Gemplus* v. *Mexico,* Guatemala argues that as a rule the claimant bears the burden of proof on damages and if a loss is too uncertain or speculative or remains otherwise unproven, a tribunal must reject the claim for damages. This is the case even if the tribunal previously established the respondent\u2019s liability *(Rompetrol* v. *Romania* award). Guatemala considers that this happened in the case before the Tribunal, where TECO\u2019S loss of value claim was too speculative because TECO had chosen to calculate its damages based on the price at which it sold its investment, but provided no direct contemporaneous evidence on what that price was. Moreover, because tariffs were reviewed every five years, TECO could not prove that its loss was permanent, which made its losses even more uncertain.79\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 116-122; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 109-112.\n\n149.\n\nGuatemala disagrees with TECO\u2019s contention that the issues of whether TECO had suffered any loss of value and the quantification of such loss had been agreed by the Parties. Guatemala states that it consistently argued in the original arbitration that TECO had not suffered any damages as a result of the sale. The fact that it reviewed TECO\u2019S damages valuation model does not prove the contrary, as the sole purpose of the review was to demonstrate that TECO suffered no losses even under that model. This meant that the Tribunal had to render a decision on these issues, which remained in dispute.80\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 113-115\n\n*1.3.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n---------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Committee has already determined that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the loss of value claim does not meet the requirements of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention and has accordingly annulled it. As a result, there is no need to decide whether that decision evidenced the presence of another defect warranting annulment.\n\n**1.4 Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure: the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the evidence deprived TECO of its right to be heard (Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.4.1 TECO \u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n151.\n\nTECO contends that the Tribunal\u2019s extensive reliance upon an untranslated portion of Mr. Restrepo\u2019s press interview took it entirely by surprise, as the Tribunal had given no warnings as to the crucial importance it would attach to it. This represents, in TECO\u2019S view, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, namely its right to be heard. The departure was serious, since it resulted in the denial of TECO\u2019S loss of value claim.81\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 117, 120; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 100.\n\n152.\n\nIn this respect, TECO notes that Mr. Restrepo was not a witness in the arbitration, was not a representative of a Party in the arbitration and had not been made available for examination at the hearing. Moreover, neither Party had submitted an English translation of the portion of the interview upon which the Tribunal expressly relied, i.e., where Mr. Restrepo discusses the \"possibility\" that the company would have cost more with a different VAD. In TECO\u2019S view, this meant that the untranslated portion remained off the record. In spite of this, the Tribunal translated that section and relied upon it in its Award. TECO adds that at no time during the hearing did the Tribunal question counsel, the witnesses, or the Parties\u2019 quantum experts regarding this section of the interview. When the Tribunal provided the Parties with a list of questions to address in their post-hearing submissions, it did not include any question regarding this aspect of the press interview.82\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 118-119; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 98, 100.\n\n153.\n\nTECO likens the situation in the present case with that existing in *Victor Pey Casado* v. *Chile.* In that case, the *ad hoc* committee annulled the damages section of the award on the ground that the tribunal had violated Chile\u2019s right to be heard, thus seriously departing from a fundamental rule of procedure. The tribunal in that case had awarded the claimants damages for a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard despite the fact that the parties had focused their pleadings almost exclusively on damages relating to the claimants\u2019 expropriation claim.83\n\nTECO\u2019S Reply, at 102.\n\n154.\n\nTECO further distinguishes the case before the Committee from the *Iberdrola* annulment decision,84 where the *ad hoc* committee found that the tribunal had no obligation to advance to the parties what its decision would be or to ask the parties for their opinion. According to TECO, the Tribunal failed to afford the Parties any opportunity to present arguments on the dispositive piece of evidence. Moreover, in its questions to the Parties at the hearing or in its list of questions to be addressed in the post-hearing submissions, the Tribunal never addressed the untranslated portion of the interview upon which it later relied. As a result, TECO was deprived of an opportunity to present its case and to be heard.85\n\n*Iberdrola Energia SA.* v. *Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/5), Decision on Annulment, 13 January 2015 (Exhibit CL-N-153) *(\"Iberdrola* annulment decision\").\n\nTECO\u2019S Reply, at 101, 103.\n\n*1.4.2 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n155.\n\nGuatemala reiterates its position that there is no fundamental rule of procedure which addresses the treatment of evidence or the standard of proof. Equally, there is no rule imposing a duty on an ICSID tribunal to consult with the parties regarding its assessment of the evidence on the record. Guatemala distinguishes the case before the Committee from *Victor Pey Casado* v. *Chile,* where the committee annulled the tribunal\u2019s decision awarding damages for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard by noting that the parties had presented no arguments whatsoever on this issue and had focused exclusively on damages for expropriation.86\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 130; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 116-118.\n\n156.\n\nGuatemala disputes that TECO was deprived of its right to be heard as a result of the Tribunal\u2019s reliance upon Mr. Restrepo\u2019s interview. According to Guatemala, the interview (i) had been on the record since Guatemala\u2019s first memorial; (ii) had been the subject of abundant discussion during the arbitration, in particular at the hearing; and (iii) concerned underlying issues - how EEGSA\u2019s sale price had been determined, whether it was impacted by the 2008 tariffs, and the future evolution of the tariffs - that the Tribunal addressed several times during the hearing and in the list of questions subsequently sent to the Parties. Guatemala adds that, being a bilingual arbitration, the Tribunal was at liberty to refer to any part of the exhibit, translated into English or not. In any event, the non-translated section of the interview referred to the same issues as other parts of the interview: EEGSA\u2019s sale price and the influence of tariffs on that price.87\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 131-132; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 119-124.\n\n157.\n\nGuatemala cites from the *Iberdrola* and *Tza Yap Shum* v. *Peru* annulment decisions as support for its contention that a tribunal has no obligation to advance to the parties what its decision will be or to ask for their opinion on it. As long as the tribunal based its decision on something that the parties would have alleged or on something they reasonably could have expected, there is no room for annulment, even if the tribunal\u2019s reasons may not have been foreseeable.88\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 130; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 125-127.\n\n158.\n\nFinally, Guatemala argues that TECO could have chosen to exercise its right under Article 10.20.9(a) of the CAFTA-DR and comment on the draft Award, but it chose not to do so.89\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 128.\n\n*1.4.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n---------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Committee has already determined that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the loss of value claim does not meet the requirements of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention and has accordingly annulled it. As a result, there is no need to decide whether that decision evidenced the presence of another defect warranting annulment.\n\n**1.5 Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and manifest excess of powers: the Tribunal overstepped the Parties\u2019 dispute (Articles 52(1)(d) and 52(1)(b)of the Convention)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.5.1 TECO \u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n160.\n\nAccording to TECO, a tribunal manifestly exceeds its powers not only when it exceeds its jurisdiction or when it fails to apply the law agreed upon by the parties, but also when it decides issues not raised by the parties, thus going beyond the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. In this respect, TECO invokes the annulment decisions in *Soufraki* v. *U.A.E., Impregilo* v. *Argentina, CDC* v. *Seychelles* and *Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan.* TECO also aligns itself with the *Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt* and *CDC* v. *Seychelles* committees\u2019 view that an excess of power is \"manifest\" if it can be discerned with little effort, if it is self-evident.90\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 75-80.\n\n161.\n\nIn TECO\u2019S view, the Tribunal decided matters not submitted to it and thus manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n162.\n\nTECO contends that the Parties\u2019 experts had agreed that, assuming liability was established, TECO would have suffered losses upon the sale of its shares in EEGSA. More precisely, there were no material differences between the Parties\u2019 calculations for the value of EEGSA in the actual scenario. Their calculations for the *but for* scenario differed considerably (on the scale of USD 3.1 million to USD 222.48 million) but, TECO argues, even Guatemala\u2019s *but for* value of EEGSA as of the date of the sale was higher than its actual value. In TECO\u2019s view, this means that the Parties agreed that, assuming liability was established, TECO suffered some loss as a result of the sale of EEGSA. However, in spite of this agreement, the Tribunal denied TECO\u2019S claim for loss of value in its entirety. TECO concludes that the Tribunal thus overstepped the limits of its authority, which, by virtue of the Parties\u2019 agreement, had been limited to the *amount* of damages for loss of value.91\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 121-123; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 106.\n\n163.\n\nTECO argues further that the Committee should pay no heed to Guatemala\u2019s denial that it conceded that TECO had suffered damages as a result of the sale. According to TECO, Guatemala had argued in the original arbitration that TECO had in fact benefited from the breach of the Treaty from August 2008 until October 2010, which resulted in negative historical damages. Guatemala\u2019s position in the original arbitration that TECO had not suffered any loss was the result of its calculation of negative historical damages which were offset against the range of positive damages figures that Guatemala calculated as TECO\u2019S loss of value resulting from the sale of EEGSA. The Parties were therefore in agreement that TECO would be entitled to damages for loss of value if liability was established.92\n\nTECO\u2019S Reply, at 107-109.\n\n164.\n\nTECO further restates its position that the treatment of evidence and burden of proof is a fundamental rule of procedure and that a party need not prove an allegation accepted by the opposing party. Therefore, by denying TECO\u2019S loss of value claim despite Guatemala\u2019s concession that damages would have been due, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.93\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 124.\n\n*1.5.2 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n165.\n\nGuatemala denies that it agreed to any aspect of TECO\u2019S loss of value claim and insists that it always argued against the award of such damages. According to Guatemala, there is nothing in its pleadings to demonstrate otherwise. The fact that Guatemala addressed TECO\u2019S methodology does not contradict this, as Guatemala only intended to demonstrate that, even under that methodology, TECO could not prove any loss. Guatemala underscores that, in the arbitration, it repeatedly referred to evidence that directly contradicted TECO\u2019S contention that the sale evidenced a loss of value.94\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 135; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 130-134.\n\n166.\n\nBecause there had never been an agreement of the Parties, the Tribunal had to decide all the claims for damages, including the claim for loss of value. As a result, the Tribunal did not depart from any rule of procedure and did not commit an excess of powers.95\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 130, 135.\n\n*1.5.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n---------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Committee has already determined that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the loss of value claim does not meet the requirements of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention and has accordingly annulled it. As a result, there is no need to decide whether that decision evidenced the presence of another defect warranting annulment.\n\n**1.6 Manifest excess of powers and serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure: the Tribunal\u2019s decision on interest (Article 52(1)(b) and 52(1)(d))**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.6.1 TECO \u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n168.\n\nAccording to TECO, the Parties agreed that, in the event that TECO was awarded damages for historical losses, TECO would be entitled to interest on the amount awarded, accruing in tranches as follows: (i) as from 1 August 2009, upon TECO\u2019S share of EEGSA\u2019s cash flows lost in the period 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2009; (ii) as from 1 August 2010, upon TECO\u2019S share of EEGSA\u2019s cash flows lost in the period from 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010 ; and (iii) from 22 October 2010, upon TECO\u2019S share of EEGSA\u2019s cash flows lost in the period from 1 August 2010 to 21 October 2010. TECO insists that Guatemala never disputed this. Moreover, TECO argues that, while initially it had presented various interest rates that could be applicable, ultimately it agreed with Guatemala\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion that, for the period before the sale, the weighted average cost of capital (8.8 percent) should apply. TECO thus considers that there was no dispute between the Parties that, if the sale of EEGSA had been caused by Guatemala\u2019s treaty breach (as the Tribunal ultimately did find): (i) interest was applicable from 1 August 2009 through 21 October 2010 with respect to historical damages, and (ii) on the rate of interest that would apply. The Tribunal, in deciding these issues not submitted to it, manifestly exceeded its powers.96\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 126-132, 136-139; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 110-114.\n\n169.\n\nIn reply to Guatemala\u2019s argument that, in the original arbitration, Guatemala had supported the application of a risk free rate, and not EEGSA\u2019s 8.8 percent WACC rate, TECO responds that it had always been Guatemala\u2019s main position that the WACC should apply. Guatemala only argued for the risk free rate as an alternative, so as to reduce the negative figure it had obtained in its calculations for historical damages. However, since the Tribunal rejected the negative historical damages, Guatemala\u2019s main position that the WACC should apply remained. Moreover, since the Tribunal found that the sale of TECO\u2019S shareholding in EEGSA was determined by Guatemala\u2019s breach, the Tribunal should have taken into account Dr. Abdala\u2019s statement - made at the hearing - that the WACC should apply.97\n\nTECO\u2019S Reply, at 115-117.\n\n170.\n\nTECO also contends that, in light of the Parties\u2019 agreement above, they had no reason to address or anticipate the question of whether an award of interest would constitute unjust enrichment. TECO adds that the Tribunal never gave the Parties the opportunity to address this issue either during the hearing or in its subsequent list of questions for the Parties\u2019 posthearing submissions. TECO argues that, had it been given the opportunity to comment, it would have explained that it had not requested interest running on the entire amount of damages as from 1 August 2008 (as found by the Tribunal), but in tranches as from 1 August 2009. TECO would also have clarified that, absent Guatemala\u2019s breach, the additional cash flows that EEGSA would have generated during the first two years of the 2008-2013 tariff period would have become available to TECO as from the end of the first and second year of the tariff period (i.e., as from August 2009 and August 2010 respectively). TECO considers that the Tribunal\u2019s failure to give the Parties an opportunity to address this issue amounts to a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, namely the right to be heard. The departure was serious because it deprived TECO of the protection the rule was intended to provide and resulted in its under-compensation in the range of USD 1 million.98\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 133-135; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 114.\n\n171.\n\nTECO points out that Guatemala does not dispute the fact that the unjust enrichment theory was never raised in the original arbitration either by itself or by the Tribunal. Further, TECO disagrees with Guatemala\u2019s position that the Tribunal enjoyed broad discretionary powers to calculate and allocate interest. TECO argues that, while discretion does exist, it must be exercised within the boundaries of the tribunal\u2019s powers and following fundamental rules of procedures.99\n\nTECO\u2019S Reply, at 118-119.\n\n*1.6.2 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n172.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s position is that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers, because the Parties had never agreed on the date from which interest would start accruing or on the applicable interest rate. According to Guatemala, TECO cannot indicate any statement included in Guatemala\u2019s pleadings to this effect. To the contrary, Guatemala submits that it repeatedly argued in the arbitration that the interest rate applicable during the period between the sale of EEGSA and the date of the award is not the WACC, but a risk-free rate, such as US 10-year government bonds.100\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 136-137; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 136-137.\n\n173.\n\nGuatemala also contends that the Tribunal did not depart from a fundamental rule of procedure when it denied TECO\u2019S claim for interest for the period before the sale of EEGSA on the grounds that it would constitute unjust enrichment. According to Guatemala, there is no rule requiring a tribunal to communicate, consult or check with the parties regarding its analysis or the conclusions reached during deliberations. Further, Guatemala reiterates that TECO could have exercised its right under Article 10.20.9(a) of the CAFTA-DRto comment on a draft of the Award, but it did not do so.101\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 139; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 139, referring to the *Iberdrola* annulment decision and Tza Yap Shum v. Peru.\n\n174.\n\nGuatemala adds that the Tribunal did not apply the theory of unjust enrichment, but used the notion to explain why interest should not accrue on sums that already included such interest, because they had not been discounted to the date of valuation. Guatemala considers that, rather than the theory of unjust enrichment, the Tribunal made its decision based on the evidence on the record, citing to the Parties\u2019 post-hearing briefs, to the exhibits and to the expert reports (including that of Mr. Kaczmarek, TECO\u2019S expert).102\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 140-142.\n\n175.\n\nFinally, referring to *Vivendi* 77,103 Guatemala submits that tribunals enjoy discretionary powers with regard to the calculation and allocation of interest. This discretion will need to be taken into account by the Committee when deciding this request.104\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3) (formerly *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. and Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux* v. *Argentine Republic),* Decision on Annulment, 10 August 2010 (Exhibit RL-111) *(Vivendi II v. Argentina\").*\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Counter-Memorial, at 140; Guatemala\u2019s Rejoinder, at 143-145.\n\n*1.6.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n---------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nManifest excess of powers. Having considered the Parties\u2019 positions and the record before it, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers when it proceeded to decide the issue of pre-Award interest rate.\n\n177.\n\nTECO argues that the Parties had agreed on the issue of pre-Award interest (both the date starting from which interest would accrue and the applicable interest rate) and that the Tribunal went beyond its mandate when it proceeded to decide the claim. For its part, Guatemala denies that such an agreement had ever been reached.\n\n178.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Guatemala. In its submissions, TECO does not point to any pleading by Guatemala wherein the latter purportedly agreed with its position on the question of interest. TECO surmises that such agreement existed from fragments of Guatemala\u2019s expert reports. However, it is quite common in international arbitration for opposing parties\u2019 experts to verify each other\u2019s methodologies and for opposing parties to present a tribunal with various hypotheses to use in its final calculations. In the Committee\u2019s view, there being no clear agreement between the Parties on this issue, the Tribunal was within its powers to appreciate that interest was disputed and to decide the starting date and which interest rate to apply.\n\n179.\n\nThe Committee notes in this respect that TECO is also contending that the Tribunal misrepresented its request for relief on the issue of interest. According to TECO, in the underlying arbitration, it requested that interest accrue in three tranches, starting from 1 August 2009, whereas the Tribunal understood its request for relief to be a request for interest on the entire amount of historical damages, calculated as from 1 August 2008. It appears to the Committee that TECO is making this argument solely with respect to the ground for annulment of manifest excess of powers. Indeed, at paragraph 114 of its Reply, TECO argued that:\n\n\"the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by overstepping the scope of the parties' dispute, given that the parties had agreed upon the 1 August 2009 start date for accrual of interest and the 8.8 percent pre-award interest rate; seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by denying TECO its right to be heard, given that the Tribunal's \u2018unjust enrichment' theory was not argued by either party and the Tribunal did not give the parties an opportunity to comment on its \u2018unjust enrichment' theory\".\n\n180.\n\nThe Committee notes that, in the underlying arbitration, and specifically in its Memorial, its Reply Memorial, its Post-Hearing Brief and its Reply Post-Hearing Brief, TECO\u2019S request for relief with respect to the issue of interest read as follows:\n\n\"[...] Claimant respectfully requests that the Tribunal issue an Award:\n\n[...]\n\n4. Ordering Respondent to pay interest on the above amount at 8.8 percent, compounded from 1 August 2008 until full payment has been made.\"105 [emphasis added]\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 313; TECO\u2019S Reply, at 321; TECO\u2019S Post-Hearing Brief, at 203; TECO\u2019S Reply Post-Hearing Brief, at 154.\n\n181.\n\nIf the Tribunal somehow misrepresented TECO\u2019S request for relief by not correlating TECO\u2019S pleadings with the testimony of its witness, that misrepresentation is not immediately apparent or obvious to the Committee. However, Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention only permits annulment of excesses of power that are \"manifest\", meaning evident, obvious or clear. The Tribunal\u2019s alleged misrepresentation of TECO\u2019S request for relief does not meet this requirement.\n\n182.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on interest does not evidence a manifest excess of powers.\n\n183.\n\nSerious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Conversely, the Committee holds that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure when it denied TECO\u2019S claim for interest on historical damages for the period before EEGSA\u2019s sale on account of \"unjust enrichment\".\n\n184.\n\nThe Committee has taken due note of Guatemala\u2019s argument according to which a tribunal is not required to communicate, consult or check with the parties with respect to its analysis or conclusions reached during deliberations. While generally this is correct, it is not without exceptions. One such exception is when a tribunal effectively surprises the parties with an issue that neither party has invoked, argued or reasonably could have anticipated during the proceedings. In such a scenario, a reasonable question to ask is whether the parties\u2019 right to be heard has been seriously affected. In this respect, the Committee aligns itself with the principle set out by the *Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan* annulment committee, according to which:\n\n\"[A] tribunal (and also a committee) is only free to adopt its own solution and reasoning without obligation to submit it to the parties beforehand, if it remains within the legal framework established by the parties. And *vice versa-,* if a tribunal prefers to use a distinct legal framework, different from that argued by the parties, it must grant the parties the opportunity to be heard.\n\n[...]\n\n[Tribunals do not violate the parties' right to be heard if they ground their decision on legal reasoning not specifically advanced by the parties, provided that the tribunal's arguments can be fitted within the legal framework argued during the procedure and therefore concern aspects on which the parties could reasonably be expected to comment, if they wished their views to be taken into account by the tribunal.\"106 [emphasis added]\n\n*Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan,* at 93, 94.\n\n185.\n\nA similar principle was adopted by the *Tza Yap Shum* v. *Peru107* and *Victor Pey Casado* v. *Chile.108,* committees.\n\n*Tza Yap Shum* v. *Peru,* at 141.\n\n*Victor Pev Casado* v. *Chile,* at 262 et seq.\n\n186.\n\nIn the case before this Committee, the Tribunal decided the following with respect to TECO\u2019S claim for interest on historical damages:\n\n\"The Arbitral Tribunal considers that interest should only accrue from the date of the sale of EEGSA to EPM in October 2010. As a matter of fact, because the US$21,100,552 historical losses damages correspond to revenues that would have progressively flowed into EEGSA from August 2008 until October 2010, and because such amount has not been discounted to August 2008, calculating interest on the entire amount of the historical damages as from the first day of the tariff period would result in an unjust enrichment of the Claimant. As a consequence, interest shall only accrue from October 21, 2010.\"109 [emphasis added]\n\nAward, at 765.\n\n187.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the legal significance of the Tribunal using the term \"unjust enrichment\" within the Award. While TECO contends that the Tribunal invoked and applied a legal concept, Guatemala\u2019s position is that \"unjust enrichment\" was simply shorthand for \"double counting\" and that the Tribunal did not in fact apply a new legal theory.\n\n188.\n\nThe Committee cannot agree with Guatemala. Any reasonable reading of the Award, which was rendered by three eminent lawyers, reveals that the Tribunal employed the term \"unjust enrichment\" - which has a specific legal meaning in most legal systems - and not \"double counting\". The Committee can only assume that the Tribunal used the term intentionally, which means that the Tribunal deliberately rejected the claim for interest on historical damages on the basis of the legal concept of unjust enrichment.\n\n189.\n\nIt is undisputed that neither the Parties nor the Arbitral Tribunal raised the concept of \"unjust enrichment\" during the discussions on interest before the Award was rendered. The concept never came up in the Parties\u2019 submissions, at the hearing or in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of questions to the Parties which post-dated the hearing. In fact, during the hearing, the Tribunal\u2019s questions to the Parties with respect to interest focused on the appropriate interest rate.110\n\nSee transcript of original hearing, at pages 1596-1605.\n\n190.\n\nThe Committee therefore finds that the notion of \"unjust enrichment\" did not form part of the legal framework established by the Parties and was never raised by the Tribunal. Moreover, the concept of \"unjust enrichment\" was not something that the Parties could reasonably have anticipated, as there was nothing to suggest that the Tribunal was concerned with it. Indeed, the Tribunal never alluded to the issue or even to double counting either during the hearing or in its subsequent letter to the Parties.\n\n191.\n\nTherefore, the Committee finds that the Parties\u2019 right to be heard on the issue of unjust enrichment was breached.\n\n192.\n\nThe Committee also finds that the departure from this fundamental rule of procedure was serious.\n\n193.\n\nThe Committee has already held that, in order for a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure to be serious, an applicant is not required to show that, if the rule had been respected, the outcome of the case would have been different or that it would have won the case. What an applicant must show is that the departure may have had an impact on the award.111\n\n*Victor Pey Casado* v. *Chile,* at 78.\n\n194.\n\nTECO contends that, if it had been given the opportunity to address the \"unjust enrichment\" theory, it would have \"explained that it had not requested interest running on the \u2018entire\u2019 amount of damages as from 1 August 2008, but rather had requested interest in tranches as from 1 August 2009\", that \"awarding such interest would not constitute unjust enrichment, because absent Guatemala\u2019s breach, the additional cash flows that EEGSA would have generated during the first two years of the 2008-2013 tariff period would have become available to TECO as from the end of the first and second year of the tariff period\".112 TECO argues that the Tribunal\u2019s breach of its right to be heard deprived it of the right to be fully compensated for Guatemala\u2019s breach, and meant that it was awarded approximately $1 million less than it was entitled to.113\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 133.\n\nTECO\u2019S Memorial, at 135.\n\n195.\n\nThe Committee cannot of course comment on the effects the discussion of the unjust enrichment theory may have had on the Parties\u2019 respective rights. What is clear however is that the Parties, if given the right to comment on this issue by the Tribunal, could have made arguments that at least had the potential to affect the ultimate financial outcome of the case. That is sufficient for the Committee to hold that the departure from the Parties\u2019 right to be heard was serious and warrants annulment.\n\n196.\n\nThis conclusion is not affected by the fact that the Tribunal enjoyed discretionary powers with respect to the allocation of interest. The Committee agrees with TECO that a tribunal\u2019s discretion cannot be without limits and, in any event, must be exercised within the confines of due process. A tribunal\u2019s serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure cannot be justified in light of a tribunal\u2019s discretion.\n\n197.\n\nFinally, the Committee cannot accept Guatemala\u2019s argument according to which TECO is barred from challenging the Award on annulment because it failed to exercise its right to comment on a draft of the Award, based on Article 10.20.9(a) of the CAFTA-DR. In the Committee\u2019s view, the waiver of a right must be established with sufficient certainty in order for it to be valid. In this case, TECO cannot be penalized for failing to anticipate that the Tribunal would apply a novel legal theory by foreclosing its right to seek annulment. The Committee finds that it is not at all clear that TECO intended to waive this right. Moreover, the Committee notes that neither Party exercised their right to comment on a draft of the Award, which - in Guatemala\u2019s theory - would have precluded both TECO and Guatemala from filing their respective Applications.\n\n198.\n\nIn conclusion, for all of the reasons set out above, the Committee finds that, in applying the legal concept of \"unjust enrichment\" without giving the Parties an opportunity to comment, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Committee therefore annuls the Tribunal\u2019s decision on interest on historical damages for the period before EEGSA\u2019s sale.\n\n**VI. GUATEMALA\u2019S APPLICATION**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1.7 Manifest excess of powers: the Tribunal asserted jurisdiction over a mere regulatory dispute under local law (Article 52(1)(b))**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.7.1 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n199.\n\nGuatemala argues that, when an arbitral tribunal exceeds the limits of the jurisdiction it has been granted, or when it fails to apply the law applicable to the dispute, it commits a manifest excess of powers. Guatemala adds that, in case of allegations of excess of powers with respect to jurisdiction, an annulment committee is bound to conduct a thorough review of jurisdictional issues. Referring to doctrinal commentary,114 Guatemala contends that any exercise of jurisdictional power without proper jurisdiction is a manifest excess of powers. In addition, the failure by a tribunal to apply the proper law exists in instances in which a tribunal fails to apply international law, if it is part of the applicable law.115\n\nGuatemala refers, in this respect, to commentary by P. Pinsolle (Exhibits RL-66, RL-68), G. Kaufmann-Kohler (Exhibit RL-67), and F. Berman (Exhibit RL-69).\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 75-88, citing from *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd.* v. *Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28), Decision on Annulment, 1 March 2011 (Exhibit RL-57) *(\"Duke* v. *Peru\"); MINE* v. *Guinea;* *Amco Asia Corporation and others* v. *Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on Annulment, 16 May 1986 (Exhibit RL-70), and *Sempra Energy International* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Decision on Annulment, 29 June 2010 (Exhibit RL-71) *(\"Sempra* v. *Argentina\");* Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 51-53.\n\n200.\n\nGuatemala takes issue with TECO\u2019S argument that incorrect decisions on jurisdiction can survive annulment. According to Guatemala, the annulment committee in *Soufraki* v. *U.A.E.* confirmed that, if a tribunal goes beyond its jurisdiction, including its jurisdiction *ratione* *materiae,* by definition it commits a manifest excess of powers. Guatemala also argues that the decisions on annulment rendered in *MCI* v. *Ecuador,116 CDC* v. *Seychelles, Klockner117* and *Tza Yap Shum* v. *Peru* all confirm that a tribunal manifestly exceeds its powers when it acts in contravention of the parties\u2019 consent and exceeds its jurisdiction.118\n\n*M.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc.* v. *Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6), Decision on Annulment, 19 October 2009 (Exhibit RL-62) (\"MCI v. Ecuador\").\n\nExhibit RL-49.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 45-50.\n\n201.\n\nIn the case before the Committee, Guatemala contends that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers because it exercised jurisdiction over what was a simple regulatory dispute under Guatemalan law, which had already been litigated in the Guatemalan courts. Guatemala argues that Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) of the CAFTA-DR, which includes the consent to arbitration, does not encompass disputes based on local law.119\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 54.\n\n202.\n\nGuatemala contends that the Tribunal manifestly failed to carry out the mandate conferred to it by the Parties, i.e. to ascertain whether or not it had jurisdiction.\n\n203.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, the Tribunal should have carefully referred to Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) of the CAFTA-DR to determine if it had jurisdiction, but failed to do so. The Award devotes less than eight pages to its decision on jurisdiction and does not refer once to Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A). Guatemala adds that, despite having correctly found that the *prima facie* test was applicable, the Tribunal failed to apply it. According to Guatemala, the correct *prima facie* test required that the Tribunal determine whether the facts supported, *prima facie,* the allegations of arbitrariness, bad faith, changes to the regulatory framework, breach of representations etc., made by TECO. However, instead of applying this test, the Tribunal just accepted the formal legal characterization of the claim as presented by TECO. Guatemala further contends the Tribunal did not discuss the distinction between a claim under domestic law and one under international law, despite the fact that this was required in order for the Tribunal to examine the fundamental basis of TECO\u2019S claim.120\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 94-96, 99-107; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 55-61.\n\n204.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, the facts of the case were identical to those present in the *Iberdrola* v. *Guatemala* arbitration, where the tribunal upheld the principle that mere regulatory law disputes are not investment treaty disputes and dismissed jurisdiction on the grounds that the claimant\u2019s claim was a domestic regulatory dispute. According to Guatemala, this case and the *Iberdrola* arbitration raised the same legal issues. Guatemala refers in this respect to statements by the Tribunal, such as \"[t]his dispute arose from the alleged violation [...] of the Guatemalan regulatory framework\",121 \"[t]he TECO\u2019S case is based in large part on the assertion that the CNEE [...] disregarded the regulatory framework applicable to the setting of electricity tariffs in Guatemala, as established by LGE and the RLGE\",122 \" [t]he question here is whether the regulatory framework permitted the regulator, in the circumstances of the case, to disregard the distributor\u2019s study and to apply its own\".123 According to Guatemala, these statements attest to the fact that the dispute was a proper domestic, regulatory dispute, which means that the Tribunal should have reached the same conclusion as the *Iberdrola* tribunal and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.124\n\nAward, at 79.\n\nAward, at 497.\n\nAward, at 534.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 71-80.\n\n205.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, an arbitral tribunal is not an administrative review body meant to ensure compliance with each and every rule or regulation set down by domestic law. Mere domestic regulatory disputes fall under the jurisdiction of domestic courts, and an investment treaty claim involves something more than a domestic law disagreement. In addition, if the dispute brought before an investment tribunal concerns a disagreement between an investor with the actions of an administrative body that has already been the subject of a final decision by the local judicial authorities, the only available claim that may be brought to the international tribunal is a claim for denial of justice. Guatemala argues that its position is supported by the awards rendered in *ADF* v. *United States,125 S.D. Myers* v. *Canada,126* *Generation Ukraine* v. *Ukraine,127 Saluka* v. *Czech Republic128* and *Azinian* v. *Mexico129* Considering that no claim for denial of justice had been brought by TECO, Guatemala argues that the Tribunal should have found that it lacked jurisdiction.130\n\n*ADF Group Inc* v. *United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1), Award, 9 January 2003 (Exhibit CL-4) (*\"ADF* v. *United States\").*\n\n*SD Myers Inc* v. *Canada* (UNCITRAL), First Partial Award, 13 November 2000 (Exhibit CL-41) (\"SD Myers v Canada \").\n\n*Generation Ukraine Inc.* v. *Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9), Final Award, 16 September 2003 (Exhibit RL-6) *(\"Generation Ukraine* v. *Ukraine\").*\n\n*Saluka Investments B.

TECO argues that the language of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention does not provide for a heightened level of scrutiny or for a wider latitude to annul awards in respect of matters of jurisdiction, and does not dispense with the requirement that an excess of powers must be manifest in order to warrant annulment. TECO argues that the decisions rendered in *Azurix* v. *Argentina,131 SGS* v. *Paraguay,132 Lucchetti* v. *Peru, MCI* v. *Ecuador, Soufraki* v. *U.A.E. and Alapli* v. *Turkey,* as well as ICSID\u2019s Background Paper on Annulment133 confirm that decisions on jurisdiction do not call for greater scrutiny than other decisions and do not dispense with the requirement that the excess of powers be manifest. TECO adds that the decisions cited by Guatemala in support of its position do not in fact support its arguments. With respect to the secondary sources referred to by Guatemala, TECO submits that they are contradicted by numerous annulment decisions which found otherwise.134\n\n*Azurix Corp.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, 1 September 2009 (Exhibit CL-N-124) *(\"Azurix* v. *Argentina\").*\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.* v. *Republic of Paraguay* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29), Decision on Annulment, 19 May 2014 (Exhibit CL-N-156) *(\"SGS* v. *Paraguay\").*\n\nExhibit CL-N-144.\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 41-45; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 25-29.\n\n207.\n\nIn the case before the Committee, TECO considers that Guatemala\u2019s criticisms of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction are not justified.\n\n208.\n\nAccording to TECO, there was no dispute between the Parties that TECO had invoked Article 10.16.1 (a)(i) of the CAFTA-DR, *i.e.,* that TECO had submitted to arbitration a claim that Guatemala had breached its obligations under the Treaty. However, that did not mean that the Tribunal needed to quote this provision or to determine at the jurisdictional level what the real and fundamental basis of the claim was. In TECO\u2019S view, the only test that the Tribunal was required to apply, and which it did apply, was the *prima facie* test of whether the facts as alleged fell within the Treaty\u2019s provisions or were capable, if proved, of constituting breaches of the obligations they referred to. The Tribunal was not required to determine whether the allegations advanced by TECO were supported by the facts - such an inquiry was properly reserved for the merits of the dispute. TECO refers in this respect to *Chevron* v. *Ecuador,135* where the tribunal expressly dismissed the argument that the claimant needed to establish its case with a 51% chance of success in order to pass the *prima facie* test. That tribunal found instead that the claimant had to show that its case was \"decently arguable\" or that it had \"a reasonable possibility as pleaded\".136 According to TECO, the Tribunal applied the *prima facie* test correctly when it found that if the TECO proved that Guatemala had acted arbitrarily and in willful disregard of the applicable regulatory framework, or showed a complete lack of candor or good faith in the regulatory process, such behavior would constitute a breach of the minimum standard.137\n\n*Chevron Corp* v. *Ecuador.* Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (Exhibit CL-85) *(\"Chevron* v. *Ecuador\").*\n\nExhibit CL-85.\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 50, 53-57; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 33-36, 39, referring to Award, at 465.\n\n209.\n\nTECO contends that the arbitral decisions relied upon by Guatemala do not support its arguments. According to TECO, the *Convial* v. *Peru138,* tribunal\u2019s statement that the party who invokes a breach of international law must also prove that the alleged facts, if ultimately proven, may constitute a violation of the treaty is in line with its own position with respect to the correct *prima facie* test. Similarly, the *Duke* v. *Peru* annulment committee found that the tribunal, in applying the *prima facie* test, must objectively assess whether the facts, as asserted, provide a basis to sustain jurisdiction, rather than examining whether the facts, as asserted, are supported by the evidence presented.139\n\n*Convial Callao S.A. and CCI-Compania de Concesiones de Infraestructure S.A.* v. *Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/2), Final Award of 21 May 2013 (Exhibit RL-133) *(\"Convial* v. *Peru\").*\n\nTECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 37-38.\n\n210.\n\nTECO also argues that the issue of whether any action - regulatory or otherwise - is in breach of international law is a matter for the merits and not for jurisdiction. The cases invoked by Guatemala to prove the contrary, with the exception of the *Iberdrola* award, were all rendered on the merits.140\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 58; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 40.\n\n211.\n\nTECO further contends that there is no inherent incompatibility between a dispute having arisen in a regulatory context and an international arbitral tribunal then being called to assess the conduct of regulatory or administrative authorities under international law. TECO submits that it had asked the Tribunal to review Guatemala\u2019s actions not in light of domestic law, but in light of Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR on fair and equitable treatment, which is an international obligation. The Tribunal therefore had before it an international dispute to which it had to apply international law. TECO argues further that *SD Myers* v. *Canada* and *Saluka* v. *Czech Republic* do not support Guatemala\u2019s case either, as the *SD Myers* v. *Canada* award, stating that a tribunal does not have an open-ended mandate to second-guess government decision making was rendered on the merits, whereas the *Saluka* v. *Czech Republic* award simply observed that not every violation of domestic law gives rise to an international treaty breach, which is uncontested.141\n\nTECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 40-43.\n\n212.\n\nTECO argues that the *Generation Ukraine* v. *Ukraine* award, relied upon by Guatemala, has been heavily criticized and, in any event, is not in line with the *jurisprudence constante -* reflected for instance by cases such as *Azinian* v. *Mexico* and *Vivendi II -* according to which there is no need to establish a denial of justice in order to find a State in breach of its international obligations, as this would conflate the legal concepts of fair and equitable treatment and denial of justice. Moreover, according to TECO, the Tribunal was correct to point out that the dispute which had been brought before it was different from the disputes that had already been settled by the Guatemalan judiciary.142\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 62-71; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 44-46.\n\n213.\n\nTECO considers that Guatemala\u2019s reliance on the *Iberdrola* award is misplaced, because the tribunal\u2019s decision in that case was not grounded on the principle that mere domestic regulatory disputes fall outside the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal, but rather on its finding that the claimant had asked the tribunal to review \"the regulatory decisions of the CNEE, the MEM and the judicial decisions of the Guatemalan courts, not in the light of international law, but of the domestic law of Guatemala\".143 This prompted the *Iberdrola* tribunal to dismiss jurisdiction, while noting that \"according to the claim of the Claimant, [the tribunal] would have to act as regulator, as administrative entity and as court of instance, to define\" issues of Guatemalan law.144 The tribunal in that case even noted that the claimant had not made any reference to international law during the hearing. Therefore, the *Iberdrola* award not only does not support Guatemala\u2019s argument, but it is also inapposite. TECO argues that, by contrast, it had asked the Tribunal to review its claim in light of Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR, which is a source of international law. The Tribunal correctly took note of this in its Award and added that even if it would \"have to decide certain points of interpretation of the regulatory framework by applying Guatemalan law, [this] does not and cannot deprive the Arbitral Tribunal of its jurisdiction\".145 Moreover, the Tribunal correctly noted that Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention prescribes that international tribunals can and must apply the laws of the host State to the issues in dispute that are properly subject to that law. In any event, this did not alter the conclusion that the Tribunal had been called on to answer the question of whether Guatemala had breached international law.146\n\nExhibit CL-N-154.\n\nExhibit CL-N-154.\n\nAward, at 469.\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 52, 59, 60; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 47-49.\n\n214.\n\nIn this respect, TECO also notes that the *Iberdrola* annulment committee rejected the argument that mere regulatory domestic law disputes fall outside the jurisdiction of investment treaty tribunals. According to the *Iberdrola* annulment decision, had the claimant\u2019s claim been dismissed on such a ground, that would have been \"sufficient to warrant an annulment based on [that] specific ground, as it does not seem tenable to maintain that there is some necessary incompatibility, as a matter of principle, between a domestic-law violation and an international-law one\".147 TECO therefore concludes that Guatemala\u2019s main critique of the Award does not withstand scrutiny.148\n\nExhibit CL-N-153.\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 61; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 50.\n\n*1.7.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n---------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nOn a preliminary note, the Committee wishes to clarify that it cannot accept Guatemala\u2019s theory according to which a tribunal\u2019s incorrect decision on jurisdiction can never survive annulment because any excess of jurisdiction is necessarily manifest.\n\n216.\n\nFirst, there is no textual basis within the ICSID Convention to support such a difference in treatment between excesses of jurisdiction and other excesses of power. Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention refers in general terms to excesses of power. Second, the interpretation propounded by Guatemala would necessarily imply that an annulment committee has the authority to conduct a *de novo* review of a tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction. This would effectively transform annulment into an appeal when issues of jurisdiction are invoked. This runs counter to the explicit terms of Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, which states generally that an award - be it on the merits or dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction - \"shall not be subject to any appeal\".\n\n217.\n\nThis has consistently been the practice of other annulment committees. For example, in *Kilig* v. *Turkmenistan,* that annulment committee found:\n\n\"The present Committee concurs that there is no basis in the Convention for the distinction propounded by Applicant and that, therefore, the same threshold applies to matters of jurisdiction and the merits in order for the Committee to find that an excess of powers is manifest.\"149\n\n*Kilig Insaat Ithalat Ihracat Sanayi Ve TicaretAnonim Sirkcti* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/1), Decision on Annulment, 14 July 2015 (Exhibit CL-N-160) *(\"Kilig* v. *Turkmenistan*\"), at 56.\n\n218.\n\nIn a like manner, the *Lucchetti* v. *Peru* committee found:\n\n\"[T]he wording of Article 52(1)(b) is general and makes no exception for issues of jurisdiction. Moreover, a request for annulment is not an appeal, which means that there should not be a full review of the tribunal's award. [...] [T]he Committee considers that the word \u2018manifest' should be given considerable weight also when matters of jurisdiction are concerned.\"150\n\n*Lucchetti* v. *Peru,* at 101.\n\n219.\n\nWhat is more, the annulment decisions referred to by Guatemala directly contradict its position. Indeed, contrary to what Guatemala is suggesting, the *Soufraki* v. *U.A.E,* annulment committee explicitly stated that, in order to warrant annulment, an excess of jurisdiction needs to be manifest:\n\n\"The *ad hoc* Committee sees no reason why the rule that an excess of power must be manifest in order to be annullable should be disregarded when the question under discussion is a jurisdictional one. Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention does not distinguish between findings on jurisdiction and findings on the merits. [... ] It follows that the requirement that an excess of powers must be \u2018manifest' applies equally if the question is one of jurisdiction. A jurisdictional error is not a separate category of excess of powers. Only if an ICSID tribunal commits a *manifest* excess of power, whether on a matter related to jurisdiction or to the merits, is there a basis for annulment.\"151\n\n*Soufraki* v. *U.A.E.,* at 118, 119.\n\n220.\n\nTheATCZ v. *Ecuador* annulment decision also directly contradicts Guatemala\u2019s position on this issue:\n\n\"It makes no difference that the issue in this case is about the Tribunal's jurisdiction, since jurisdiction does not give the *ad hoc* Committee a wider competence to assess the validity of the award under Article 52 but must be dealt with as any other issue. The standards for reviewing the Tribunal's decision about competence are therefore the same as those which *ad hoc* committees should apply when they review any other matters.\"152\n\n*MCI v. Ecuador,* at 55.\n\n221.\n\nIn *Tza Yap Shum* v. *Peru,* the annulment committee similarly stated:\n\n\"The Committee notes that the text of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention makes no distinction between decisions of the arbitral tribunal on competence or substance. [...] Deference to the legal and factual findings of an arbitral tribunal is the same for any decision. It follows that the standards of the review are the same for competence as those which *ad hoc* committees apply when they review any other matters decided by an arbitral tribunal.\"153\n\n*Tza Yap Shum* v. *Peru,* at 78, 79.\n\n222.\n\nThe Committee also considers it useful to recall that its mandate under the ICSID Convention is not to verify whether the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional analysis was correct, but only whether it was tenable as a matter of law. In the words of the *Fraport* v. *Philippines* annulment committee:\n\n\"[T]he requirement of a \u2018manifest excess of power' goes to the nature of the review exercise. In cases where the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is reasonably open to more than one interpretation, the *ad hoc* Committee will give special weight to the Arbitral Tribunal's interpretation of the jurisdictional instrument. [...] The Committee is convinced that the jurisprudence of ICSID *ad hoc* Committees on the \u2018tenable' standard for review on issues of jurisdiction is to be interpreted to like effect. The Committee considers that the excess of jurisdiction should be demonstrable and substantial and not doubtful.\"154 [internal citations omitted]\n\n*Fraport* v. *Philippines,* at 44.\n\n223.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s first criticism of the Award is that the Tribunal allegedly failed to address its jurisdictional objection in any meaningful way, which is evidenced by the fact that the Tribunal omitted to examine Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) of the CAFTA-DR (which provided consent to arbitration155) and failed to apply the *prima facie* test.156\n\nArticle 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) of the CAFTA-DR reads:  \n \"1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:  \n (a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim (i) that the respondent lias breached  \n (A) an obligation under Section A\".\n\nThe Committee observes that these arguments are made both in connection with this ground for annulment, as well as in connection with an alleged failure by the Tribunal to state reasons for its decision on jurisdiction. For purposes of the present analysis however, the Committee will limit itself to examine the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction in light of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n224.\n\nAs explained in greater detail below, the Committee finds these criticisms baseless and that the Tribunal addressed Guatemala\u2019s jurisdictional objection in full.\n\n225.\n\nGuatemala considers that eight pages of analysis dedicated to the question of jurisdiction are insufficient for discharging the Tribunal\u2019s mandate to the Parties. The Committee fails to see how the purportedly succinct character of a tribunal\u2019s analysis can be relevant under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which is limited to determining whether a tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers. Considering that Guatemala has made this same argument under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee will address it in more detail under Section **VI.1.8** of this Decision.\n\n226.\n\nMoreover, the Committee finds that the Tribunal addressed all three main arguments157 upon which Guatemala\u2019s jurisdictional objection was based: (i) that TECO\u2019S claim is a regulatory disagreement on the interpretation of Guatemalan domestic law; (ii) that TECO cannot use international arbitration as a means to appeal the decisions of the Guatemalan courts and that TECO waived its right to raise a claim for denial of justice; and (iii) that the decision of the *Iberdrola* tribunal should be followed.158 The Award also addressed the following issues: (i) whether the Republic of Guatemala had consented to arbitration under the CAFTA-DR;159 (ii) whether TECO\u2019S shareholding in EEGSA qualified as an investment under the CAFTA-DR;160 (iii) whether TECO\u2019S shareholding in EEGSA qualified as an investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention161; and (iv) whether TECO is an investor under the CAFTA-DR162. As a result, the Committee can only take note that the Tribunal manifestly *did address* Guatemala\u2019s jurisdictional objection.\n\nAward, at 466-488.\n\nAward, at 238.\n\nAward, at 437.\n\nAward, at 438.\n\nAward, at 439.\n\nAward, at 440.\n\n227.\n\nThe fact that the Tribunal did not quote and examine Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) of the CAFTA-DR is irrelevant. Guatemala had not argued that TECO had failed to submit a claim for breach of an obligation under Section A \"Investment\" of the CAFTA-DR Chapter Ten, which is what Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) of the CAFTA-DR requires. Consequently, the Committee finds that there was no need for the Tribunal to engage in an analysis of this text. In any event, a reference to this legal text would have added nothing and would have changed nothing in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning.\n\n228.\n\nThe Committee also finds that the Tribunal applied the *prima facie* test within its jurisdictional analysis.\n\n229.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal identified and applied the *prima facie* test at paragraphs 444 and 445 of the Award, where the Tribunal stated that it would determine \"whether the facts alleged by the Claimant are capable, if proven, of constituting breaches of the Respondent\u2019s international obligations under CAFTA-DR\". Since TECO had made an allegation of breach of Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR, the Tribunal proceeded to determine its contents. In its analysis, the Tribunal referred to the text of the Treaty,163 to the Parties\u2019 submissions,164 to five arbitral awards (two of which it agreed with), and to at least five doctrinal commentaries. The Tribunal found that \"a willful disregard of the fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework is based, a complete lack of candor or good faith on the part of the regulator with the investor, as well as a total lack of reasoning\" would constitute a breach of the minimum standard under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR.165 Looking at TECO\u2019S allegations, the Tribunal noted that they appeared to be supported by evidence and were of such nature that, if ultimately proved, they could establish a breach of Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR.166\n\nAward, at 448.\n\nAward, at 449-453\n\nAward, at 458.\n\nAward, at 459-464.\n\n230.\n\nGuatemala takes issue with the wording of the test employed by the Tribunal. However, a simple comparison of the test applied by the Tribunal (\"whether the facts alleged by the Claimant are capable, if proven, of constituting breaches of the Respondent\u2019s international obligations under the CAFTA-DR\"167) with the test employed in the *Convial* v. *Peru* case invoked by Guatemala (\"the party who invokes such an international violation [must] sufficiently prove that the alleged facts \u2018if proved, may constitute a violation of the Treaty\u2019\") shows that the wording of the *prima facie* test is in all important respects identical. The Committee observes instead that Guatemala\u2019s criticisms (\"the Tribunal just accepted the formal legal characterization of the claim as presented by TGH\"168, \"the Tribunal... incorrectly accepted TGH\u2019s allegations as sufficient without reviewing the underlying facts\"169) pertain to the correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s application of the *prima facie* test.\n\nAward, at 444.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 57.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 60.\n\n231.\n\nAs the Committee has already indicated above, its mandate under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention is not to ascertain the correctness of a tribunal\u2019s application of the law, but only its tenability. In light of paragraphs above, the Committee finds that the Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law (the *prima facie* test) and endeavored to apply it to the facts in dispute. Therefore, the Tribunal\u2019 *s prima facie* analysis was tenable and evidences no manifest excess of powers.\n\n232.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s second criticism is that the Tribunal failed to find that TECO\u2019S claim was of a purely domestic law nature, which led it to incorrectly conclude that it had jurisdiction over the case.170\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 63.\n\n233.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, what Guatemala is seeking is to have the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction reversed for the incorrect application of the law. This is impermissible under the ICSID Convention. The only analysis that the Committee may undertake is to determine whether the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction was tenable as a matter of law.\n\n234.\n\nAfter a careful review of the Award, the Committee finds that it was.\n\n235.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal first observed that TECO had requested a finding that Guatemala was in breach of an obligation under the CAFTA-DR, which is an international treaty. To the Tribunal, this meant that it was called upon to apply international law to the facts of the dispute and that the dispute was international. The Tribunal further found that, in light of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, this conclusion did not change because in some instances it would be required to apply Guatemalan law.171 The Tribunal then ruled that the absence of a denial of justice claim was not an impediment to its jurisdiction, because its task was to assess the conduct of the Guatemalan regulatory authorities (which were organs of the State) in light of customary international law.172 The Tribunal also clarified that it would refer for guidance to the decisions of Guatemalan courts on points of Guatemalan law, but this did not mean that its role was that of an appellate court, as its task was to apply international law to the facts in dispute, which included the content of Guatemalan law.173\n\nAward, at 466-470.\n\nAward, at 471-473, 475, 478, 479.\n\nAward, at 474-477.\n\n236.\n\nThe Committee cannot find anything manifestly unreasonable or untenable in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis. Moreover, as TECO has rightly pointed out and as the *Iberdrola* annulment committee recently confirmed174, there is no inherent incompatibility between a regulatory dispute having arisen at the domestic law level and an arbitral tribunal being subsequently called to assess the conduct of the State under international law. The fact that Guatemala does not accept the Tribunal\u2019s finding that a lack of a denial of justice claim did not preclude its jurisdiction over the dispute does not change this conclusion. It is evident to both Parties and to the Committee that, while the opinion shared by Guatemala exists, it is not unanimously accepted, and there have been numerous arbitral tribunals that have found otherwise.175 What this shows is that the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the applicable law, while not unanimously accepted, is nonetheless at least tenable. This is sufficient to conclude that annulment on this ground is not warranted.\n\n*Iberdrola* annulment decision, at 82: \"[I]f the Tribunal\u2019s argument to decline its jurisdiction was as maintained by Iberdrola in its application for annulment, this would be sufficient to warrant an annulment based on this specific ground, as it does not seem *tenable* to maintain that there is some necessary incompatibility, as a matter of principle, between a domestic-law violation and an international-law one. In the Committee\u2019s opinion, a violation of the BIT and a violation of domestic law pertain to different questions and should be analyzed under independent standard. Hence, it is possible for a State to violate a BIT without violating its domestic law, or vice versa.\"\n\n*See, Azinian* v. *Mexico, Vivendi II* v. *Argentina.*\n\n237.\n\nFinally, the Committee fails to see how the Tribunal not reaching the same conclusion as the *Iberdrola* tribunal with respect to jurisdiction is relevant for this ground of annulment. Not only is there no doctrine of *stare decisis* under international law, but also the parties, the underlying treaties, the legal arguments and the evidence in the two cases were different. The Tribunal\u2019s decision not to follow the *Iberdrola* tribunal\u2019s decision was therefore at least tenable.\n\n238.\n\nThe Committee therefore finds that, in upholding jurisdiction over TECO\u2019S claims, the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers.\n\n**1.8 Failure to state reasons for the decision on jurisdiction (Article 52(1)(e))**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.8.1 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n239.\n\nGuatemala contends that both the total lack of reasons, as well as insufficient, inadequate or contradictory reasons may warrant annulment. An award must allow the reader to understand how the tribunal went from the initial facts to its conclusions.176\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 130.\n\n240.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, such reasoning is lacking from the Award\u2019s decision on jurisdiction, where the Tribunal failed to examine the relevant provisions of the CAFTA-DR and failed to apply the required *prima facie* test. This made the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction incomprehensible.177\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 145-148.\n\n241.\n\nGuatemala contends that the first task of the Tribunal was to analyze the scope of consent to arbitration, i.e., the written agreement to arbitrate included in Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) of the CAFTA-DR. However, unlike the *Iberdrola* tribunal, which carefully considered the scope of the parties\u2019 consent to arbitration, the Tribunal did not cite to Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) of the CAFTA-DR and did not analyze its provisions. Guatemala considers that it was not sufficient for the Tribunal to verify whether TECO had invoked the Treaty (which it had), and that the Tribunal needed to ascertain the scope of consent under the Treaty and to check the credibility of TECO\u2019S allegations.178\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 131-135.\n\n242.\n\nGuatemala adds that the Tribunal failed to apply the *prima facie* test in order to determine whether or not it had jurisdiction. According to Guatemala, the Tribunal needed to examine what the fundamental basis of the claim was and to determine whether the facts of the case, if proven, might *prima facie* give rise to a genuinely international claim rather than merely raising issues of local law. Referring to the *Duke* v. *Peru* annulment decision, and to the awards and decisions on jurisdiction rendered in *UPS* v. *Canada179* the *Oil Platforms* case,180*Bayindir* v. *Pakistan181* and *Convial* v. *Peru,* Guatemala contends that, in examining the fundamental basis of a claim, a tribunal cannot simply accept the formal legal characterization of the claim as presented by the claimant, but must objectively characterize those facts itself. Guatemala considers that such an analysis is lacking in the Award, as the Tribunal did not analyze the facts or attempt to characterize them objectively, and did not verify the plausibility of the claims or whether they had sufficient foundation. The Tribunal devoted merely one page to the *prima facie* test, where it recited TECO\u2019S allegations and then concluded that they were sufficient to establish that the claim was covered by the Treaty.182\n\n*United Parcel Service of America, Inc.* v. *Canada* (UNCITRAL case).

However, that did not mean that the Tribunal needed to quote this provision or to determine at the jurisdictional level what the real and fundamental basis of the claim was. In TECO\u2019S view, the only test that the Tribunal was required to apply, and which it did apply, was the *prima facie* test of whether the facts as alleged fell within the Treaty\u2019s provisions or were capable, if proved, of constituting breaches of the obligations they referred to. The Tribunal was not required to determine whether the allegations advanced by TECO were supported by the facts - such an inquiry was properly reserved for the merits of the dispute. TECO refers in this respect to *Chevron* v. *Ecuador,* where the tribunal expressly dismissed the argument that the claimant needed to establish its case with a 51% chance of success in order to pass the *prima facie* test. That tribunal found that instead the claimant had to show that its case was \"decently arguable\" or that it had \"a reasonable possibility as pleaded\".183 According to TECO, the Tribunal applied the *prima facie* test correctly when it found that if TECO proved that Guatemala had acted arbitrarily and in willful disregard of the applicable regulatory framework, or showed a complete lack of candor or good faith in the regulatory process, such behavior would constitute a breach of the minimum standard.184\n\n*Chevron* v. *Ecuador.*\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 50, 53-57; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 33-36, 39, referring to Award, at 465.\n\n245.\n\nTECO contends that the arbitral decisions relied upon by Guatemala do not support its arguments. According to TECO, the *Convial* v. *Peru* tribunal\u2019s statement that the party who invokes a breach of international law must also prove that the alleged facts, if ultimately proven, may constitute a violation of the treaty is in line with its own position with respect to the correct *prima facie* test. Similarly, the *Duke* v. *Peru* annulment committee found that the tribunal, in applying the *prima facie* test, must objectively assess whether the facts, as asserted, provide a basis to sustain jurisdiction, rather than examining whether the facts, as asserted, are supported by the evidence presented.185\n\nTECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 37-38.\n\n*1.8.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n---------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nBefore analyzing whether the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction evidences a failure to state reasons, the Committee wishes to make some preliminary observations with respect to this ground for annulment.\n\n247.\n\nGuatemala contends that \"[b]oth a total absence of reasons, as well as insufficient, inadequate or contradictory reasoning\" may justify annulment. The Committee has no problem agreeing that a total absence of reasons, as well as genuinely contradictory reasons do not satisfy the standard set out in Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. A more nuanced approach is necessary however when dealing with an allegation of \"insufficient\" or \"inadequate\" reasoning, as both allegations could result in the review on the merits of a tribunal\u2019s statement of reasons, an impermissible exercise under the ICSID Convention.\n\n248.\n\nIn this Committee\u2019s view, \"insufficient\" reasons can lead to annulment only in situations such as that described by the *Vivendi I* annulment committee:\n\n\"In the Committee's view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision.\"186\n\n*Vivendi 1* v. *Argentina,* at 65.\n\n249.\n\nIn other words, insufficiency of reasons can lead to annulment only when a tribunal did provide some explanations for its decision, but these are insufficient from a logical point of view to justify the tribunal\u2019s conclusion. Insufficiency of reasons is not a ground for annulment where a tribunal did not explain why it rejected arguments, evidence or authorities that were not relevant or necessary for its analysis. Similarly, insufficiency of reasons does not warrant annulment if the tribunal did not address every argument, piece of evidence or authority in the record. In the words of the *Enron* v. *Argentina* annulment committee:\n\n\"[A] tribunal has a duty to deal with each of the *questions (\"pretensiones* \") submitted to it, but is not required to comment on all arguments of the parties in relation to each of those questions. [...] [T]he Committee considers that the tribunal is required only to give reasons for its decision in respect of each of the *questions.* This requires the tribunal to state its pertinent findings of fact, its pertinent findings as to the applicable legal principles, and its conclusions in respect of the application of the law to the facts. If the tribunal has done this, the award will not be annulled on the basis that the tribunal could have given more detailed reasons and analysis for its findings of fact or law, or that the tribunal did not expressly state its evaluation in respect to each individual item of evidence or each individual legal authority or legal provision relied upon by the parties, or did not expressly state a view on every single legal and factual issue raised by the parties in the course of the proceedings. The tribunal is required to state reasons for its *decision,* but not necessarily reasons for its *reasons''187*\n\n*Enron* v. *Argentina,* at 222.\n\n250.\n\nSimilarly, \"inadequate\" reasons may justify annulment only if they cannot logically explain the decision they are purportedly supporting. Therefore, \"inadequate\" reasons are frivolous reasons, and not incorrect or unconvincing reasons.188\n\n*AUNE* v. *Guinea,* at 5.08; *Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt,* at 79; CDC v. Seychelles, at 70; *Vivendi 1* v. *Argentina,* at 64; *Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan,* at 101.\n\n251.\n\nTurning now to Guatemala\u2019s criticisms of the Award, the Committee notes that Guatemala is arguing that the Tribunal allegedly dismissed its objection to jurisdiction \"without reasoning\", failed to examine Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) of the CAFTA-DR and \"omitted completely the *prima facie* test\".189 Guatemala is also criticizing the Tribunal for accepting the formal legal characterization of the claim as presented by TECO, for not objectively characterizing the facts alleged by TECO, and for not verifying the plausibility of TECO\u2019S claims.190\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 131.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 136-144.\n\n252.\n\nThe Committee has no difficulty dismissing these criticisms.\n\n253.\n\nIndeed, it is obvious on a simple reading of the Award that the Tribunal provided reasons for its decision on jurisdiction, eight pages of reasons to be exact. There is therefore no basis to Guatemala\u2019s argument that the Tribunal dismissed its objection to jurisdiction without reasoning.\n\n254.\n\nAs the Committee has previously found at Section **VI.1.7** above, the fact that the Tribunal did not quote and examine Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) of the CAFTA-DR is irrelevant, as it was undisputed that TECO had submitted a claim for breach of an obligation under Section A \"Investment\" of the CAFTA-DR Chapter Ten, which is what Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) of the CAFTA-DR requires. There was therefore no need to address this legal text. A tribunal cannot be required to address in its award issues which neither party has raised during the course of the proceedings and which have no impact on the award. Even more importantly, this is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n255.\n\nThe Committee also notes that, while Guatemala is arguing that the Tribunal completely omitted to apply the *prima facie* test to its jurisdictional analysis, at the same time it is criticizing the manner in which the test was applied. As the Committee has just found,191 the Tribunal did in fact apply the *prima facie* test. Paragraphs 443 to 465 of the Award attest to this. What Guatemala appears to be arguing is that the Tribunal applied the *prima facie* test *incorrectly,* i.e., by accepting the formal legal characterization of the claim as presented by TECO, by not objectively characterizing the facts alleged by TECO, and by not verifying the plausibility of TECO\u2019S claims. However, as clarified multiple times within this Decision, incorrect reasons are never a ground for annulment under the ICSID Convention generally, and under Article 52(1)(e) particularly. The only test that the Committee may employ in order to verify whether the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction satisfies the standard set under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is whether the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning can be followed from \"Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion\"192 and whether the reasoning is not frivolous, i.e., incapable of logically explaining the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n\nPlease see above at Section VI. 1.7.\n\n*MINE* v. *Guinea,* at 5.09.\n\n256.\n\nThe Committee has no difficulty finding that the Tribunal\u2019s analysis meets these requirements. Indeed, the Tribunal first found that the Republic of Guatemala had consented to arbitration under the CAFTA-DR,193 that TECO\u2019S shareholding in EEGSA qualified as an investment under the CAFTA-DR194 and under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention,195 and that TECO was an investor under the CAFTA-DR.196 The Tribunal then determined that it needed to apply the *prima facie* test in order to ascertain whether it had jurisdiction197 and that the first step in this analysis was defining the applicable standard under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR, which TECO alleged had been breached.198 The Tribunal did this by examining the text of the applicable treaty,199 the Parties\u2019 positions and various doctrinal and jurisprudential sources.200 Following this, the Tribunal verified whether TECO\u2019S allegations, if ultimately proven, corresponded to conduct that breached Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR.201\n\nAward, at 437.\n\nAward, at 438.\n\nAward, at 439.\n\nAward, at 440.\n\nAward, at 443-445.\n\nAward, at 447.\n\nAward, at 448.\n\nAward, at 449-458.\n\nAward, at 459-465.\n\n257.\n\nThe Committee finds that the Tribunal set out the logical steps in its analysis, while the reasoning is clear and can be followed with ease from beginning to end. The fact that the Tribunal\u2019s analysis may not have been as elaborate as Guatemala would have wished does not change this conclusion. As the *Enron* v. *Argentina* committee rightly found, a tribunal is not required to give reasons for its reasons, or to address each argument, piece of evidence or authority submitted by the parties.\n\n258.\n\nMoreover, the Committee has no difficulty in holding that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning was not frivolous, but logically capable of explaining the Tribunal\u2019s ultimate decision.\n\n259.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction satisfies the requirements of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention and annulment is not warranted.\n\n**1.9 Manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons: the Tribunal reviewed and de facto reversed the Constitutional Court decisions (Article 52(1)(b) and 52(1)(e))**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.9.1 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n----------------------------\n\n260.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, it is a fundamental principle of international law that an investment treaty tribunal may not review decisions by national courts on local law matters, except in cases of denial of justice. Relying on *Hassan Awdi* v. *Romania202 Apotex* v. *United States203 Jan de Nul* v. *Egypt204* and *Arif* v. *Moldova205* Guatemala submits that international arbitral tribunals may not sit in appeal and review the decisions of national courts on issues of domestic law. Similarly, a public authority cannot be in breach of international law for implementing a decision supported by its local courts, unless the local courts\u2019 decision itself is challenged under international law for denial of justice.206\n\n*Hassan Awdi, Enterprise Business Consultants, Inc. and Alfa El Corporation* v. *Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/13), Award, 2 March 2015 (Exhibit RL-134) (*\"Hassan Awdi* v. *Romania\").*\n\n*Apotex Inc.* v. *United States* (UNCITRAL), Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 14 June 2013 (Exhibit RL-135) *(\"Apotex v.

This represents, in Guatemala\u2019s view, a manifest excess of powers. Guatemala takes issue with the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the disputes resolved by the Guatemalan judiciary were not the same as the one before the Tribunal. In its view, there was no distinct Treaty dispute and the Tribunal adjudicated on the purely Guatemalan law controversy already resolved by the Constitutional Court. Guatemala explains that the issues before the Tribunal - whether the regulator committed an abuse of power and disregarded the regulatory framework, whether the CNEE willfully disregarded the fundamental principles of the regulatory framework, and whether that framework permitted the regulator to disregard the distributor\u2019s study and apply its own -were the same issues that had been before the Constitutional Court.207\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 120-125; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 89-92.\n\n262.\n\nIn Guatemala\u2019s reading of the Award, the Tribunal\u2019s decision that Guatemala breached the international minimum standard was based on Resolution 144-2008 and its alleged unlawfulness under the Guatemalan regulatory framework. However, in its decision of 18 November 2009, the Constitutional Court decided against the argument that the Resolution was arbitrary and breached the regulatory framework. In particular, Guatemala considers that the Constitutional Court found that: (i) Resolution 144-2008 fell within the scope of the CNEE\u2019s powers; (ii) the CNEE had followed the process set forth by the law; (iii) the Expert Commission\u2019s report was not binding on the CNEE; (iv) the Expert Commission could be lawfully dissolved after it had rendered it report; and (v) the CNEE could decide whether or not to accept the Bates White Study or the Sigla study to establish the tariffs. In addition, according to Guatemala, in the decision of 24 February 2010, the Constitutional Court found that Resolution 144-2008 had been issued in accordance with the law. In reaching the opposite conclusion - that Resolution 144-2008 breached the regulatory framework and was arbitrary - the Award reversed the decisions of the Constitutional Court.208\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial at 121-124, 126-129; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 93-101.\n\n263.\n\nGuatemala submits that the Tribunal\u2019s improper revision of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions is underscored by the fact that several of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions mirror those of Judge Chac\u00f3n, a member of the Guatemalan Constitutional Court who had rendered a dissenting opinion. One such conclusion is that Article 98 of the RLGE permitted the CNEE to depart from the distributor\u2019s study only in two specific situations. Another such conclusion was that the distributor did not have to implement all of the Expert Commission\u2019s observations into its study.209\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 130-134.\n\n264.\n\nGuatemala does not consider relevant that the Tribunal attempted to distinguish the findings of the Constitutional Court from those of the Award. The crux of the matter is, according to Guatemala, that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on liability was based on Resolution 144-2008, its alleged breach of the regulatory framework and arbitrariness, whereas the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision on 18 November 2009 upheld the consistency of Resolution 144-2008 with the entire regulatory framework. In its view, trying to distinguish between the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding that the Expert Commission\u2019s report was not binding and the Award\u2019s finding that the CNEE had nonetheless the duty to consider the report and provide reasons if it chose to disregard it is entirely artificial. Guatemala considers the latter an implicit revision of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions. This underscores the Award\u2019s inconsistency with the findings of the Constitutional Court: for the Court, Resolution 144-2008 was lawful; for the Tribunal, it was not only unlawful, but contrary to fundamental principles of the regulatory framework.210\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 135-137; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 102-104.\n\n265.\n\nGuatemala concludes that, in so finding, the Tribunal put itself in the shoes of an international appellate court and manifestly exceeded its powers.211\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 139-144; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 105-106.\n\n266.\n\nGuatemala adds that the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the CNEE breached the regulatory framework by issuing Resolution 144-2008 is manifestly at odds with its decision to not review the findings of the Guatemalan courts.212 In Guatemala\u2019s view, this makes the Award plainly contradictory and subject to annulment for failure to state reasons.213\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 212; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 160.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 204-212; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 155-160.\n\n*1.9.2 TECO \u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n267.\n\nTECO considers that Guatemala mischaracterizes the Tribunal\u2019s findings and the scope of the Constitutional Court decisions. Even if the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the Constitutional Court decisions was wrong, that would not provide a valid basis for annulment as annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision.214\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 86, 87, 102; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 24, 64, 81.\n\n268.\n\nIn this respect, TECO first argues that the Tribunal did not find a breach of Guatemalan law, but a breach of international law. As a result, Guatemala\u2019s contention that an investment tribunal cannot find a breach of domestic law where a local court found none is inapposite. In response to Guatemala\u2019s argument that a public authority cannot be in breach of international law for implementing a decision supported by the local courts unless the local courts\u2019 decision itself is challenged under international law, TECO contends that the legality of a State\u2019s acts under national law does not determine their lawfulness under international law. According to TECO, it is a principle of international law that a State cannot use its judicial system in order to insulate itself from a violation of an international law obligation.215\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 88-90; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 65.\n\n269.\n\nSecond, TECO observes that the Tribunal found its claim to be an international dispute distinct from the disputes before the Guatemalan courts (which involved different parties, different issues and a different applicable law). As a result, the Tribunal also found that the decisions of the Constitutional Court could not have *res judicata* effects in the arbitration and did not dispose of it. Despite not being bound by these decisions, the Tribunal conceded that the findings of the Constitutional Court could be referred to insofar as the Court had interpreted issues of Guatemalan law that were relevant for the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of a breach of international law.216\n\nTECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 66, 67.\n\n270.\n\nThird, TECO argues that the Tribunal did not reverse the findings of the Constitutional Court, but in fact incorporated them in its Award. The Tribunal found that the Constitutional Court had decided two issues: (i) that the CNEE was entitled to dissolve the Expert Commission after it had issued its report; and (ii) that, because the Expert Commission\u2019s report was not binding upon the CNEE (who had the exclusive power to set the tariffs), the CNEE was entitled to fix the tariffs on the basis of its own independent study. According to TECO, the Tribunal used this interpretation of Guatemalan law in its analysis on liability. TECO further considers that the Tribunal correctly found that the Constitutional Court did not decide: (i) whether, pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE, EEGSA had failed to correct its VAD report; (ii) whether, despite the fact that the report of the Expert Commission was not binding upon the CNEE, the regulator had nonetheless a duty to consider it and to provide reasons for its decision to disregard it; and (iii) the rationality of the adopted tariff, i.e. whether the CNEE had acted arbitrarily in conducting EEGSA\u2019s 2008-2013 tariff review.217\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 91-92; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 68-71.\n\n271.\n\nTECO further refers to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Constitutional Court could not have intended to say that the tariffs would be set at the CNEE\u2019s sole discretion, without paying any regard to the conclusions of the Expert Commission. The Tribunal found that, both under the regulatory framework and international law, the CNEE had an obligation to give serious consideration to the Expert Commission\u2019s report and to provide reasons for departing from it. TECO adds that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on liability was not premised solely on Resolution 144-2008, but also on the manner in which EEGSA\u2019s 2008-2013 tariff review was conducted and the manner in which its 2008-2013 VAD and tariffs were established. Separate and apart from Resolution 144-2008, the Tribunal took issue with the CNEE\u2019s less than one day review of EEGSA\u2019S revised VAD study, with its decision to extend the deadline of the Expert Commission\u2019s report for the week of 24 July 2008 and then disregard it along with the Bates White study on the basis that this date did not allow for publication of the tariff before 1 August 2008. As a result, the Tribunal found that the process by which EEGSA\u2019s 2008-2013 VAD and tariffs had been established breached the minimum standard of treatment - an issue not submitted to the Constitutional Court.218\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 93-101; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 74-78.\n\n272.\n\nFourth, TECO submits that the Tribunal did not find Resolution 144-2008 unlawful as a matter of Guatemalan law and its findings mentioned above had not been the subject of proceedings before the Constitutional Court. As a result, there could not be any contradiction between the Tribunal\u2019s statement, on the one hand, that its task is not to review the findings of Guatemalan courts and, on the other hand, its holding on liability.219\n\nTECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 73, 79-81.\n\n273.\n\nFinally, TECO considers that it is irrelevant that the Tribunal made several findings with respect to the regulatory framework that are in line with the dissenting opinion of Judge Chac\u00f3n of the Constitutional Court. What matters is that the majority opinion of the Constitutional Court did not decide issues that were before the Tribunal.220\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 103.\n\n*1.9.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n---------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nFor the reasons set out in more detail below, the Committee has come to the conclusion that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons and did not manifestly exceed its powers when it considered the Constitutional Court decisions.\n\n275.\n\nFailure to state reasons. On a preliminary note, the Committee reiterates that, under the terms of the ICSID Convention, an award may be annulled for failure to state reasons on the grounds of contradictory reasoning only if there is a genuine contradiction within the tribunal\u2019s statement of reasons.221 In addition, if an award can be read in such a way as to be internally consistent, a committee shall prefer this interpretation, as opposed to one which highlights an award\u2019s inner inconsistency.222\n\n*Vivendi 1* v. *Argentina,* at 65.\n\n*CDC* v. *Seychelles,* at 81.\n\n276.\n\nGuatemala contends that a genuine contradiction is readily apparent on the face of the Award. In its view, both decisions of the Constitutional Court upheld the legality of Resolution 144-2008 under Guatemalan law. The Tribunal, while formally stating that it would not review the findings of the Constitutional Court on matters governed by Guatemalan law, nevertheless concluded that Resolution 144-2008 had been issued in breach of the regulatory framework.\n\n277.\n\nThe Committee has carefully reviewed the Award and finds that no contradiction exists.\n\n278.\n\nThe Committee considers that, for an award to warrant annulment under Article 51 (1)(e) of the ICSID Convention on account of contradictory reasons, a contradiction must exist within the body of the tribunal\u2019s reasoning. An alleged contradiction between an award and elements extraneous to the tribunal\u2019s reasoning (such as evidence in the record) is not a ground for annulment, but a criticism purporting to show that the tribunal incorrectly assessed the record and an attempt to reverse the award on the merits.\n\n279.\n\nIn the instant case, Guatemala is arguing that the Award\u2019s finding that Resolution 144-2008 did not comply with Guatemalan law is at odds with an alleged finding to the contrary made by the Guatemalan Constitutional Court. In other words, Guatemala is alleging that the Tribunal incorrectly interpreted and applied the Constitutional Court decisions. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, this is not a valid ground for annulment.\n\n280.\n\nIn any event, the Committee finds no contradiction between, on the one hand, the Tribunal\u2019s statement that it would not review the decisions of the Guatemalan judiciary on issues governed by Guatemalan law,223 and its subsequent finding that Resolution 144-2008 did not comply with the regulatory framework.224 Indeed, before making the latter finding, the Tribunal interpreted the decisions of the Constitutional Court and held that the Guatemalan judiciary had not made any ruling with respect to the legality of the 2008-2013 tariff or of the process leading to its establishment:\n\n\"[T]he Constitutional Court noted in its decision of November 18, 2009 that it had not been called to assess the *\u2018rationality!'* of the adopted tariff. Such term can be understood both with respect to the content of the tariff and with the process leading to its establishment.\"225 [emphasis added]\n\nAward, at 477.\n\nAward, at 681: \"The Arbitral Tribunal therefore concludes that Resolution No. 144-2008 is inconsistent with the regulatory framework.\"\n\nAward, at 563.\n\n281.\n\nTherefore, to the Tribunal, the legality of the 2008-2013 tariffs establishment was very much an open question and one within its mandate to decide. By proceeding to answer this question within the award, the Tribunal did not contradict itself but followed its logical path of reasoning up to its natural conclusion.\n\n282.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in its consideration of the Constitutional Court decisions.\n\n283.\n\nManifest excess of powers. The Committee recalls that an award may be annulled for manifest excess of powers if a tribunal (i) exceeded or failed to exercise its jurisdiction; or (ii) failed to apply the applicable law. In both cases, the excess of powers must be \"manifest\", i.e., easily perceived, not susceptible of interpretation one way or the other. If a tribunal\u2019s analysis is tenable, there is no room for annulment.\n\n284.\n\nIt is not entirely clear to the Committee in what way Guatemala is alleging that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. On the one hand, Guatemala is reiterating its earlier argument, according to which the dispute before the Tribunal was a \"purely Guatemalan law controversy\"226 that had already been resolved by the Constitutional Court. The Committee has concluded at Sections **VI.1.7** and **VI.1.8** above that the Tribunal did not commit any annullable error (be it manifest excess of powers or failure to state reasons) when it found that the dispute before it was an international dispute that had not been previously adjudicated by the Guatemalan judiciary. Consequently, the Committee sees no need to repeat those findings here and will simply state that Guatemala\u2019s argument has no merit.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 92.\n\n285.\n\nOn the other hand, Guatemala is alleging that the Tribunal disregarded \"a fundamental principle of international law that an investment treaty tribunal may not review decisions by national courts on local law matters, except in case of denial of justice.\"227According to Guatemala, both decisions of the Constitutional Court concluded that the CNEE\u2019s Resolution 144-2008 had been issued in accordance with Guatemalan law, while the Tribunal found the opposite.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 81.\n\n286.\n\nThe Committee finds that the Tribunal did not revise or reverse the Constitutional Court decisions. To the contrary, the Tribunal interpreted the Constitutional Court decisions in order to determine the scope of its findings and subsequently integrated the decisions within its analysis made under international law. Moreover, the Tribunal afforded the Constitutional Court decisions their due weight as proof of Guatemalan law.\n\n287.\n\nIndeed, the Committee observes that the Tribunal interpreted the Guatemalan regulatory framework \"in light of the relevant findings of the Guatemala [sic] Constitutional Court\"228 The Tribunal clarified that, while the Constitutional Court decision could not \"have the effect of a precedent or have any *res judicata* effect in this arbitration\", and that they did not dispose of the dispute before it,229 it will nevertheless \"be relevant to the solution of the present international law dispute\".230\n\nAward, at 500.\n\nAward, at 515-518.\n\nAward, at 519.\n\n288.\n\nWhile interpreting the Guatemalan regulatory framework, the Tribunal found that the CNEE could calculate the VAD on the basis of its own independent study in two circumstances: (i) in case of a failure by the distributor to deliver its own study; or (ii) in case of a failure by the distributor to correct its study according to the LGE and RLGE.231 The Tribunal noted that the Constitutional Court had not decided whether the distributor had failed to correct its study pursuant to Article 98 of the RLGE.232\n\nAward, at 520-539.\n\nAward, at 540-544.\n\n289.\n\nThe Tribunal then proceeded to determine the role of the Expert Commission in light of Article 75 of the LGE.233 In this respect, the Tribunal found that the Constitutional Court decisions established that the Expert Commission\u2019s report only had an illustrative or informative value and that the Commission did not have the power to decide in a binding manner the dispute between the CNEE and EEGSA. The Tribunal explicitly incorporated the Constitutional Court\u2019s holding into the Award:\n\n\"559. As a threshold matter, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the Constitutional Court made it very clear, in its decisions of November 18, 2009 and February 24, 2010, that the report of the Expert Commission would only have an *\u2018illustrative or informative '* value, and that the Commission had no power to determine in a binding manner a dispute between the CNEE and EEGSA.\n\n560. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that this is a point of interpretation of Article 75 of the LGE that is submitted to Guatemalan law, and in respect of which it is proper to defer to the decision made by the Constitutional Court.\"234 [emphasis added] [internal citations omitted]\n\nAward, at 545-558.\n\nAward, at 559, 560.\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that the Constitutional Court did not decide whether the regulator had an obligation to give serious consideration to the Expert Commission\u2019s report when establishing the tariff, or to give reasons for a decision to depart from it. The Tribunal interpreted the Constitutional Court decisions to mean that, despite not being bound by the Expert Commission\u2019s report, the regulator did not enjoy unlimited discretion in fixing the tariff and had a duty to seriously consider the report and provide valid reasons if it chose to depart from it.235\n\nAward, at 561, 562.\n\n291.\n\nIn support of its finding that the regulator did not enjoy unlimited discretion in fixing the tariff and that the Constitutional Court had not pronounced itself on the content of the tariff and the process leading to its establishment, the Tribunal relied upon the Constitutional Court decision of 18 November 2009 and particularly its conclusion at page 20 of the English version.236 That section of the Constitutional Court decision reads:\n\n\"It is estimated that tariffs fixed, when the report by the Experts' Commission has not been accepted as valid to guide this policy, cannot be, within its discretion, harmful or unreasonably arbitrary, in view of the indicators of efficient operators as a reference [...]. However, the rationality of the tariff schemes approved was not reported as damage or as evidence in this *amparo* action, and the only damage reported focused on the concept of legal due process, which was already analyzed (paragraph a) of section VI of the conclusions.\"237 [emphasis added]\n\nAward, at 563, footnote 483.\n\nExhibit C-331. At Section VI paragraph a of this decision, the Constitutional Court had stated: \"Neither the Law nor the Rules mentioned above contain any provisions granting any roles of the Experts\u2019 Commission other than to issue an opinion, which was fulfilled by submitting it. It is not perceived, even interpreting other legal or regulatory provisions on the subject, that the experts\u2019 activity should continue, which is why its dissolution was an innocuous consequence of the completion of its role to define the tariff as requested by the General Electricity Law and the National Electricity Commission. Therefore, when the Experts\u2019 Commission fulfilled its purpose by submitting its report, and there being no further legal intervention in the procedure, the dissolution of that Commission could not have caused any damage to the petitioner.\"\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal found that this interpretation was in conformity with the regulatory framework, which configured the Expert Commission as a neutral body whose conclusions were meant to have greater authoritative value than those of a consultant to the CNEE.238 The Tribunal considered that the obligation to give serious consideration to the Expert Commission\u2019s report stemmed from both the regulatory framework, but also from the international minimum standard of treatment, which prohibits State officials from exercising their authority in an abusive, arbitrary or discriminatory manner.239\n\nAward, at 547-576.\n\nAward, at 583-588.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that the distributor was under no obligation to incorporate in its VAD study the observations made by the CNEE that had been put before the Expert Commission. Unless the regulator provided valid reasons to disregard the conclusions of the Expert Commission, the distributor was bound to incorporate the CNEE\u2019s comments only if the Expert Commission found in favor of the regulator.240\n\nAward, at 589.\n\n294.\n\nRelying upon these findings, the Tribunal concluded that Resolution 144-2008 was inconsistent with the regulatory framework due to the regulator\u2019s failure to analyze the Expert Commission\u2019s report and to provide reasons for departing from its conclusions.241\n\nAward, at 681.\n\n295.\n\nThe Committee considers that the Tribunal\u2019s above interpretation of the Constitutional Court decisions was tenable. Other interpretations could also be possible. However, as stated earlier, the Committee is not empowered by the ICSID Convention to decide which of the competing interpretations is correct. The purpose of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention is only to ascertain whether a tribunal\u2019s interpretation was one among the various possible interpretations of the applicable law.\n\n296.\n\nThis being true in the present case, the Committee considers that the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the Constitutional Court decisions does not evidence a manifest excess of powers.\n\n297.\n\nThe Committee wishes to make some further observations with regard to this ground for annulment.\n\n298.\n\nGuatemala contends that the Tribunal based its decision that Guatemala breached Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR solely upon its finding that Resolution 144-2008 did not comply with the regulatory framework. This is incorrect. Indeed, the Tribunal grounded its finding of liability under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR on: (i) the regulator\u2019s disregard for the fundamental principles underpinning the regulatory framework, as evidenced by Resolution 144-2008;242 (ii) the regulator\u2019s arbitrary conduct when it accepted to receive the Expert Commission\u2019s report in the week of 24 July 2008 only to then disregard it along with the Bates White Study on the basis that this did not leave enough time to publish the tariff by 1 August 2008;243 and (iii) the regulator\u2019s arbitrary preliminary review of the 28 July Bates White study, which underscored its desire to reject it for a more favorable study prepared by its own consultant, Sigla.244\n\nAward, at 682.\n\nAward, at 684-688.\n\nAward, at 689-695.\n\n299.\n\nFinally, the Committee considers it irrelevant that several of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions mirror those of a judge who dissented from the 18 November 2009 decision of the Constitutional Court. As TECO correctly points out, what matters is that the majority of the Constitutional Court did not decide issues that were before the Tribunal.\n\n300.\n\nTherefore, for all the reasons above, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers when it considered the Constitutional Court decisions.\n\n**1.10 Manifest excess of powers: the Tribunal failed to apply international law and equated a breach of domestic law with a breach of the CAFTA-DR (Article 52(1)(b))**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.10.1 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n301.\n\nGuatemala contends that the Tribunal failed to properly examine international law, failed to apply the proper law to the facts of the case and conflated a regulatory domestic law breach with a breach of international law. This, in Guatemala\u2019s submission, represents a manifest excess of powers which warrants the annulment of the Award in its totality.245\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 128.\n\n302.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, the law applicable to the merits of the case was the CAFTA-DR and customary international law. Indeed, TECO had based its claim on the minimum standard of treatment under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR. Guatemala notes that the Tribunal was extensively briefed by the Parties on the subject of the content of the international minimum standard and how it differed from the autonomous standard of fair and equitable treatment. No fewer than 447 pages of pleadings and 150 legal authorities were dedicated to this issue, in addition to submissions by four other CAFTA-DR member States. In Guatemala\u2019s view, this required that the Tribunal draw a careful distinction between the concepts of fair and equitable treatment and the international minimum standard of treatment, and examine in detail customary international law. Instead, the Tribunal only dedicated four paragraphs to its analysis, without carrying out any real examination of the case law, of the Parties\u2019 submissions or of the submissions of the non-disputing State parties. Guatemala considers that it was not enough for the Tribunal to refer to concepts such as \"arbitrariness\", \"abuse of power\", \"good faith\", \"lack of due process\" or \"total lack of reasons\"; the Tribunal needed to carefully examine the meaning and content of these concepts and establish the content of the minimum standard of treatment. Guatemala thus argues that, having failed to delimit the international law concepts relevant to its analysis, the Tribunal failed to analyze the international law applicable to the dispute, which means that the Tribunal failed to apply international law.246\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial at 146-168; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 107-122.\n\n303.\n\nGuatemala further argues that the Tribunal never showed how Guatemala\u2019s alleged breach of the regulatory framework also resulted in a breach of international law, but simply conflated the concepts of a domestic and an international law breach. Guatemala refers, in this respect, to statements by the Tribunal according to which it was called upon to resolve \"an allegation of abuse of power by the regulator and disregard of the Regulatory Framework\",247 whether \"the CNEE willfully disregarded the fundamental principles of the Regulatory Framework\"248 and \"whether the Regulatory Framework permitted the regulator, in the circumstances of the case, to disregard the distributor\u2019s study and apply its own\".249 The Tribunal even concluded that a domestic law breach had occurred: \"Resolution No. 144-2008 is inconsistent with the Regulatory Framework\".250 Guatemala contends that the Tribunal did not further discuss how this breach of domestic law led to a breach of international law. In Guatemala\u2019s view, this shows yet again that the Tribunal did not apply international law to the dispute, but domestic law.251\n\nAward, at 489.\n\nAward, at 481.\n\nAward, at 534.\n\nAward, at 681.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 169-174; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 123-127.\n\n*1.10.2 TECO \u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n304.\n\nTECO contends that Guatemala\u2019s criticisms are contradicted by the plain language of the Award.\n\n305.\n\nTECO first argues that, in defining the content of the minimum standard of treatment under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR, the Tribunal relied directly upon relevant case law and commentary, and specifically noted that it agreed with the standard as articulated by many arbitral tribunals and authorities. According to TECO, both Parties had relied in the arbitration upon the same case law regarding the content of the minimum standard of treatment, and the non-disputing State party submissions did not present any differing views. As a result, TECO considers that there was no need for the Tribunal to engage in an elaborate analysis of the case law or the Parties\u2019 positions. In the alternative, TECO argues that a tribunal\u2019s failure to fully conceptualize the content of a standard is not a ground for annulment as long as the tribunal correctly identified that standard and strove to apply it to the facts of the case *(Impregilo* v. *Argentina, Alapli* v. *Turkey)252*\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 80, 81; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 53.\n\n306.\n\nTECO adds that, in any event, the Tribunal not only defined the applicable legal standard under customary international law, but also reviewed the Parties\u2019 positions and examined specifically how that standard would apply in the context of administrative proceedings, such as the tariff review process. In this respect, TECO quotes extensively from the Award, such as: (i) the Tribunal\u2019s statement that it needed to define the applicable standard under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR as a threshold matter; (ii) the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the minimum standard of treatment, which is \"infringed by conduct attributed to the State and harmful to the investor if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\"253; (iii) the Tribunal\u2019s finding that a lack of due process in administrative proceedings - which exists for instance when the administration entirely fails to provide reasons for its decisions or when it disregards its own rules - constitutes a breach of the minimum standard; (iv) the Tribunal\u2019s finding that a willful disregard of the fundamental principles underpinning the regulatory process, a complete lack of candor or good faith of the regulator, as well as a total lack of reasoning, would similarly breach the standard; and (v) the Tribunal\u2019s finding that these considerations are particularly important in the context of a tariff review process that is based on the parties\u2019 good faith cooperation and where the parties had contemplated the intervention of a neutral body to resolve their differences.254\n\nAward, at 454.\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 75-78, 82-84; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 54-58.\n\n307.\n\nTECO further contends that Guatemala\u2019s argument according to which the Tribunal conflated the concepts of domestic and international law breaches are not supported by the Award. According to TECO, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis on liability was based on the minimum standard of treatment under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR, examined by reference to international arbitral decisions and legal commentaries. The Tribunal\u2019s decision on liability was equally based on the minimum standard of treatment, which had been breached when the regulator arbitrarily repudiated the fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework rested and failed to observe due process. According to TECO, the Tribunal did not apply Guatemalan law, but international law to the facts before it, and explained why the CNEE\u2019s conduct was arbitrary in connection with Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR255\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 85; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 59, 60.\n\n*1.10.3 The Committee\u2019s analysis*\n---------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nAfter having carefully examined the Parties\u2019 arguments and the record before it, the Committee finds that annulment of the Award on this ground is not warranted.\n\n309.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s criticisms of the Award under this ground for annulment are twofold. First, Guatemala appears to be taking issue with the level of detail in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis under international law, which it deems unsatisfactory. Second, Guatemala criticizes the Award for conflating a breach of domestic law with a breach of international law. The Committee will address these in turn.\n\n310.\n\nWith regard to the Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to carefully examine the applicable law, the Committee notes that the Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law as being the CAFTA-DR and customary international law.\n\n311.\n\nThe Committee would also like to recall that annulment for manifest excess of powers is only warranted when a tribunal has failed to apply the applicable law or when, while purporting to apply it, it committed an error so egregious that its interpretation can be deemed as untenable. Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention does not allow the annulment of awards for failing to examine the applicable law in the level of detail desired by a party. As long as a tribunal correctly identified the applicable law and endeavored to apply it to the facts of the case, annulment is not warranted.256\n\n*Alapli* v. *Turkey,* at 234.\n\n312.\n\nThe Committee considers that a tribunal must be allowed a degree of discretion with regard to the level of detail of its analysis under the applicable law. An award cannot be annulled because a tribunal, despite correctly identifying the applicable law and its contents, did not examine in detail all the authorities or all the arguments made by the parties. The *Enron* v. *Argentina* annulment committee made a very useful observation in this respect.257 albeit in the context of Article 52(1)(e).\n\n*Enron* v. *Argentina,* at 222.\n\n313.\n\nIn the case before the Committee, the Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law. Moreover, within its analysis, the Tribunal referred to the text of the Treaty,258 to the Parties\u2019 submissions,259 to five arbitral awards and to at least five doctrinal commentaries. The two awards with which the Tribunal agreed with had been invoked by both Parties.260 Referring to these sources, the Tribunal found that \"the minimum standard of FET under Article 10.5 of CAFTA-DR is infringed by conduct attributed to the State and harmful to the investor if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\".261\n\nAward, at 448.\n\nAward, at 449-453\n\nAward, footnotes 428, 431, 432.\n\nAward, at 454.\n\n314.\n\nMoreover, contrary to Guatemala\u2019s contention, the Tribunal did examine the relationship between the autonomous standard of fair and equitable treatment and that under customary international law at paragraphs 447 and 448 of the Award, and the Tribunal noted that:\n\n\"Article 10.5(2) provides that FET under CAFTA-DR does not require treatment in addition to or beyond what is required by the minimum standard of treatment applicable under customary international law. Article 10.5 also provides that the minimum standard *\u2018includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world\u2019,\"262*\n\nAward, at 448.\n\n315.\n\nThe Tribunal also examined how the legal standard under customary international law would apply in the context of administrative proceedings. Indeed, the Tribunal found that \"a lack of due process in the context of administrative proceedings such as the tariff review process constitutes a breach of the minimum standard\",263 that \"a willful disregard of the fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework is based, a complete lack of candor or good faith on the part of the regulator in its dealings with the investor, as well as a total lack of reasoning, would constitute a breach of the minimum standard.\"264\n\nAward, at 457.\n\nAward, at 458.\n\n316.\n\nThe fact that the Tribunal did not extensively examine the over 400 pages of pleadings and 150 legal authorities is irrelevant for purposes of a discussion under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee considers it sufficient for purposes of this discussion that the Tribunal did correctly identify the applicable law and set out its content.\n\n317.\n\nIn addition, as the Committee will explain in greater detail below, the Tribunal endeavored to apply that law to the facts of the case. In this respect, the Committee cannot agree with Guatemala\u2019s second criticism, namely that the Tribunal failed to explain how Guatemala\u2019s breach of the regulatory framework resulted in a breach of international law and thus conflated the two concepts.\n\n318.\n\nThe Committee first observes that the Tribunal did in fact apply domestic law to the issues in dispute that were properly submitted to it. The Committee has concluded at Section **VI.1.7** above that that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by proceeding in this manner. Indeed, the Tribunal examined the Guatemalan regulatory framework in light of the Constitutional Court decisions and concluded that it rested upon two fundamental principles: (i) that, save in the limited exceptions provided by the LGE and the RLGE, the tariff would be based on a VAD calculation made by a prequalified consultant appointed by the distributor; and (ii) that, in case of disagreement between the regulator and the distributor, the disagreement would be resolved having regard to the conclusions of the Expert Commission.265 On the basis of the regulator\u2019s failure to pay any regard to the conclusions of the Expert Commission and to give reasons for this, the Tribunal concluded that Resolution 144-2008 was inconsistent with the regulatory framework.266\n\nAward, at 665\n\nAward, at 681.\n\n319.\n\nThe Committee finds that, in spite of referring to and applying domestic law in the instances above, the Tribunal ultimately found liability under international law on the basis of an international law analysis. The Committee considers that, contrary to Guatemala\u2019s contentions, the Tribunal did not equate domestic law with international law, but carefully distinguished between the two.\n\n320.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Tribunal established the content of the international minimum standard of treatment in the specific context of administrative proceedings by holding that \"a lack of due process in the context of administrative proceedings such as the tariff review process constitutes a breach of the minimum standard\", and that \"a willful disregard of the fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework is based, a complete lack of candor or good faith on the part of the regulator in its dealings with the investor, as well as a total lack of reasoning, would constitute a breach of the minimum standard.\"267\n\nAward, at 457-458.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal then applied international law to the facts of the case before it. In this respect, the Tribunal held that \"both the regulatory framework and the minimum standard of treatment in international law obliged the CNEE to act in a manner that was consistent with the fundamental principles on the tariff review process in Guatemalan law\".268 However, in the case before it, the Tribunal found that the regulator had disregarded the fundamental principles underpinning the regulatory framework, as evidenced by Resolution 144-2008269 The Tribunal further held that, by accepting to receive the Expert Commission\u2019s report in the week of July 24, 2008, and to then disregard it along with the Bates White study on the basis this did not leave it with enough time to publish the tariff by August 1, 2008, the CNEE acted in breach of the fundamental principles of due process as well as in a contradictory and aberrant manner.270 The Tribunal explained that \"both under the regulatory framework and under the minimum standard of treatment, the CNEE could and should have taken the time, after careful review of the Expert Commission\u2019s report, to implement its conclusions in the Bates White study\"271 and that \"[t]he Arbitral Tribunal can find no justification, other than its desire to reject the Bates White study in favor of the more favorable Sigla\u2019s study, for such a behavior\".272 The Tribunal further found that the \"arbitrariness of the regulator\u2019s behavior [was] evidenced by the result of the *\u2018preliminary review \u2019* that it conducted over the weekend of 26-27 July of the Expert Commission\u2019s report and of its likely consequences on the May 5, 2008 version of the Bates White study\".273 The Tribunal interpreted these findings in light of its earlier conclusions at paragraphs 457 and 458 of the Award and found that the \"repudiation of the two fundamental regulatory principles applying to the tariff review process [was] arbitrary and breach[ed] elementary standards of due process in administrative matters\".274 It was on this basis that the Tribunal concluded that the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR had been breached.275\n\nAward, at 682.\n\nAward, at 682.\n\nAward, at 688.\n\nAward at 690.\n\nAward at 690.\n\nAward, at 691.\n\nAward, at 711.\n\nAward, at 711.\n\n322.\n\nThe Committee has no difficulty determining that the Tribunal\u2019s analysis and decision on liability were based on the CAFTA-DR and customary international law, as applied to the facts of the case.\n\n323.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by failing to apply international law and by equating a breach of domestic law with a breach of the CAFTA-DR.\n\n**1.11 Failure to state reasons: the Tribunal failed to indicate the test of applicable international law (Article 52(1)(e))**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.11.1 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n324.\n\nGuatemala argues that the Tribunal\u2019s analysis is also deficient with respect to the test of international law applicable to the merits of the dispute. The Tribunal simply found that there was arbitrariness and lack of due process, without actually defining these concepts under international law. Guatemala thus concludes that the Tribunal did not apply international law to the facts of the case and failed to give reasons for its decision.276\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 199-202; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 149, 154;\n\n325.\n\nIn Guatemala\u2019s view, it is impossible for any objective reader of the Award to understand why or how Guatemala breached or did not breach the minimum standard of treatment, because all the Tribunal said was that the fair and equitable treatment standard \"is infringed by conduct [that] [...] is arbitrary, grossly unfair or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\".277 However, the Tribunal did not define the terms \"arbitrariness\" and \"due process\" under international law, even though these concepts were crucial to its analysis and eventual decision. Further, the Tribunal did not explain how the facts of the case could be characterized as being arbitrary or lacking in due process. Guatemala also takes issue with the Tribunal not referring to the *ELSI* case278 for the definition of arbitrariness, in light of the fact that the Parties had disagreed on the meaning of the concept. Further, Guatemala considers that the Tribunal should have explained why the CNEE\u2019s behavior - found to be in breach of the Regulatory Framework - was also arbitrary under international law.279\n\nAward, at 454.\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI)* Judgment, ICJ Reports, 1989 (Exhibit RL-1) *(\"ELSE).*\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial at 197-202; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 149-153.\n\n*1.11.2 TECO \u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n326.\n\nTECO contends that the Tribunal examined the concepts of both \"arbitrariness\" and \"due process\", noting that \"[a] lack of reasons may be relevant to assess whether a given decision was arbitrary and whether there was [a] lack of due process in administrative proceedings\"280 and that \"[i]n assessing whether there has been such a breach of due process, it is relevant that the Guatemalan administration entirely failed to provide reasons for its decisions or disregarded its own rules\".281 TECO further argues that there was no need for the Tribunal to refer to the *ELSI* case, because both Parties had referred to it as setting forth the applicable definition of arbitrariness under international law. In response to Guatemala\u2019s argument that the Parties had not agreed on the definition of arbitrariness, TECO states that their dispute was not on the notion itself, but rather on whether *ELSI* supported Guatemala\u2019s argument that the CNEE\u2019s actions were not arbitrary.282\n\n*1.11.3 The Committee\u2019s analysis*\n\nAward, at 587.\n\nAward, at 457.\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 79; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, a 61-63.\n\n327.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the Award and the Parties\u2019 submissions and finds that Guatemala\u2019s contentions are without merit.\n\n328.\n\nIndeed, contrary to Guatemala\u2019s position, the Award clearly indicates what the Tribunal understood by arbitrariness and lack of due process. The Tribunal specified that \"[i]n assessing whether there has been such a breach of due process, it is relevant that the Guatemalan administration entirely failed to provide reasons for its decisions or disregarded its own rules\"283 and that \"[a] lack of reasons may be relevant to assess whether a given decision was arbitrary and whether there was lack of due process in administrative proceedings.\"284 In support of its findings, the Tribunal quoted to doctrinal commentary stating that \"[i]f State officials can demonstrate that the decision was actually made in an objective and rational (i.e. reasoned) manner, they will defeat any claim made under the standard.\"285 The Tribunal added that this \"is particularly so in the context of a tariff review process that is based on the parties\u2019 good faith cooperation, and in the context of which the parties had contemplated the intervention of a neutral body to resolve differences.\"286\n\nAward, at 457.\n\nAward, at 587.\n\nAward, at 587, quoting from Grierson-Weiler and Laid, \"Standards of Treatment\", in Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law, Oxford (2008), pp. 284-285.\n\nAward, at 587.\n\n329.\n\nThe fact that the Tribunal did not reference the *ELSI* case for defining arbitrariness is beside the point. What matters under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is whether a reader of the award can understand how a tribunal \"proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion\".287 The Committee finds that the Award\u2019s reasoning more than satisfies this requirement. What is more, as held by the *Enron* v. *Argentina* committee, a tribunal cannot be required to address each legal authority or legal provision relied upon by the parties, or to state a view on every single legal and factual issue they raised.288\n\n*MINE* v. *Guinea,* at 5.09.\n\n*Enron* v. *Argentina,* at 222.\n\n330.\n\nFinally, the Committee disagrees with Guatemala\u2019s contention that the Tribunal failed to explain how the facts in this case could have been characterized as being arbitrary or lacking in due process. The Committee has already found that the Tribunal grounded its finding of liability under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR on: (i) the regulator\u2019s disregard for the fundamental principles underpinning the regulatory framework, as evidenced by Resolution 144-2008;289 (ii) the regulator\u2019s arbitrary conduct when it accepted to receive the Expert Commission\u2019s report in the week of 24 July 2008 only to then disregard it along with the Bates White Study on the basis that this did not leave enough time to publish the tariff by 1 August 2OO8;290 and (iii) the regulator\u2019s arbitrary preliminary review of the 28 July Bates White study, which underscored its desire to reject it for a more favorable study prepared by its own consultant, Sigla.291 The Committee considers that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is clear and can be followed without difficulty.\n\nAward, at 682.\n\nAward, at 684-688.\n\nAward, at 689-695.\n\n331.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that the Award does not warrant annulment on this ground.\n\n**1.12 Failure to state reasons: lack of reasoning and manifest contradiction regarding the decision on damages for historical losses (Article 52(1)(e))**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.12.1 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n332.\n\nGuatemala considers that the Award should be annulled for failure to state reasons in light of the contradiction which exists between the Tribunal\u2019s decision on liability and its decision on historical damages. According to Guatemala, there is an inherent contradiction in the Tribunal\u2019s finding, on the one hand, that the report of the Expert Commission was not binding and that the CNEE could depart from it and/or reject the Bates White study if it provided reasons, and, on the other hand, calculating damages on the basis of the Bates White study and the Expert Commission\u2019s report.292\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 214, 219, 220; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 161, 162.\n\n333.\n\nAccording to Guatemala, the Tribunal based its decision on liability on the CNEE\u2019s failure to provide reasons for its decision not to follow the Expert Commission\u2019s report, to reject the Bates White 28 July 2008 study and to apply the Sigla study for setting the tariffs. In other words, had the CNEE paid sufficient consideration to the report of the Expert Commission, and had it provided sufficient reasons to depart from it and from the Bates White study and to adopt the Sigla study instead, the Tribunal would have found no breach of the Treaty. Respondent considers that, in spite of holding Guatemala liable due to failure to provide reasons for its decisions, the Tribunal calculated damages that resulted from a different conduct of the CNEE, as if the CNEE had been bound to follow the Bates White study in determining the tariffs. Guatemala adds that this becomes clear when looking at paragraph 731 of the Award (included in the section on damages), where the Tribunal held that \"[t]he Respondent [did not] establish that the regulator would have had any valid reasons to disregard the pronouncements of the Expert Commission regarding the asset base\" and that \"[a]fter careful review of the evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced that the Bates White 28 July study failed to incorporate the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements or that there is any reason to depart from such pronouncements\".293 According to Guatemala, within this paragraph, the Tribunal changed the basis for liability - from a failure to provide reasons to a failure to follow the pronouncements of the Expert Commission. As a result, damages were calculated not for an act that had been found to be in breach of the Treaty, but for an act that was previously considered lawful.294\n\nAward, at 731.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 214-220; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 163-167.\n\n334.\n\nGuatemala considers that this flaw in the Award is similar to the one in the *Victor Pey Casado* v. *Chile* award, and which ultimately led to the latter\u2019s annulment. In that case, the tribunal used the claimant\u2019s damages calculation which was based on a claim for expropriation - a claim that the tribunal had dismissed - and found liability for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.295\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 221; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 177.\n\n*1.12.2 TECO \u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n335.\n\nTECO contends that Guatemala mistakenly reads the Award\u2019s finding on liability as being based solely on the CNEE\u2019s failure to state reasons for its decision to disregard the Expert Commission\u2019s rulings and the Bates White 28 July 2008 study. In the view of TECO, a proper reading of the Award reveals that there is no inherent contradiction between the Tribunal\u2019s decision on liability and its decision on damages.\n\n336.\n\nAccording to TECO, the Tribunal held that the CNEE did not have unlimited discretion in the setting of the tariffs, but was required to give serious consideration to the Expert Commission\u2019s report. The CNEE nonetheless chose to entirely ignore it. In TECO\u2019S view, the Tribunal held that not only had the CNEE failed to provide reasons for not adopting the Expert Commission\u2019s rulings, but also that there were no valid reasons for disregarding them. In addition, TECO contends that the Tribunal found that the 28 July 2008 Bates White incorporated the Expert Commission\u2019s rulings, which means that the Tribunal\u2019s decision to quantify historical losses based upon these documents was consistent with its decision on liability.296\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 107-112; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 83-86.\n\n*1.12.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n----------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Committee finds that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on historical damages does not evidence either a lack of reasons or a manifest contradiction with the Tribunal\u2019s decision on liability. As a result, annulment of the Award on this ground is not warranted.\n\n338.\n\nIndeed, Guatemala misconstrues the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s finding of liability. Contrary to what Guatemala is alleging, the Tribunal did not find liability solely on the basis of the regulator having failed to provide reasons for its decision to reject the Expert Commission\u2019s report. The Tribunal also found liability because Guatemala had displayed an arbitrary conduct during the tariff review process.\n\n339.\n\nAt paragraphs 687 and 688 of the Award, the Tribunal explained that the regulator\u2019s decision to accept to receive the Expert Commission\u2019s report in the week of 24 July 2008 but to then disregard it along with the Bates White study on the basis that it did not have enough time to publish the tariff by 1 August 2008 was \"contradictory\" and \"aberrant\".297 The Tribunal further determined that the arbitrariness of the regulator\u2019s conduct was also evident from its preliminary review of the Expert Commission\u2019s report, conducted over the weekend of 26-27 July. The Tribunal found that, because this review showed that the Expert Commission\u2019s report was unfavorable to the regulator and would have led to a higher VAD, the CNEE decided to use the more favorable Sigla study.298\n\nAward, at 687, 688.\n\nAward, at 689-695.\n\n340.\n\nThereafter, the Tribunal found that the Sigla study used by the regulator did not reflect the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements.299 The Tribunal determined that the reasons provided by Guatemala during the arbitration to explain the regulator\u2019s decision to disregard the Expert Commission\u2019s report were after the fact justifications that did not withstand scrutiny.300\n\nAward, at 696.\n\nAward, at 697-706.\n\n341.\n\nOn these bases, the Tribunal concluded that the CNEE decided to disregard the Bates White study and to apply the Sigla study when none of the two circumstances permitting such a decision under RLGE Article 98 was present.301\n\nAward, at 707.\n\n342.\n\nHaving found that, at the time of the events, the regulator disregarded the Expert Commission\u2019s report in order to benefit from the more favorable Sigla study, that the reasons to deviate from the Expert Commission\u2019s report invoked by Guatemala in the arbitration were not convincing and that the Sigla report did not reflect the Expert Commission\u2019s pronouncements, the Tribunal logically proceeded to calculate the damages based on the report of the Expert Commission. The Committee finds that this was a natural and logical progression of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, which does not change the basis for liability, but to the contrary, builds upon it.\n\n343.\n\nThe Committee therefore dismisses Guatemala\u2019s argument that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons and contradicted itself within its decision on damages for historical losses.\n\n**1.13 Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure: the Tribunal ignored the evidence submitted by Guatemala on damages (Article 52(1)(d))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.13.1 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n344.\n\nGuatemala argues that the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure when it ignored evidence submitted by Guatemala on historical losses. According to Guatemala, Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention refers to rules of a fundamental nature, such as principles of natural justice, and necessarily includes the parties\u2019 right to be heard and to have an equal opportunity to present their case. In addition, the departure must be serious, in that it must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had the rule been observed.302\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 236-238; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 188-190.\n\n345.\n\nGuatemala submits that Mr. Damonte, Guatemala\u2019s expert in the proceedings on electricity tariff reviews, had presented in his reports a scenario considering the application of the Expert Commission\u2019s report to establish the tariff. Nevertheless, the Tribunal decided TECO\u2019S claim for historical losses solely on the basis of TECO\u2019S evidence on the grounds that Guatemala had not presented an expert report assessing the tariff that would have applied had the CNEE followed the Expert Commission\u2019s report. According to Mr. Damonte\u2019s calculations, the resulting damages for historical losses would have been reduced to USD 5.3 million. Guatemala submits that, by ignoring this evidence, the Tribunal failed to accord it due process, and its decision on historical losses must be annulled.303\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 239-241; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 191, 192.\n\n*1.13.2 TECO\u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n346.\n\nTECO contends that this basis for annulment amounts to an impermissible attempt to have the Committee review on the merits the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of Mr. Damonte\u2019s documentary and testimonial evidence. Because annulment is not an appeal, errors of the tribunal in the application of the law (as long as the tribunal purported to apply the proper governing law) and mistakes of fact are not in general grounds for annulment.304\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 116; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 89.\n\n347.\n\nAccording to TECO, the Tribunal had valid grounds to reject both versions of Mr. Damonte\u2019s study, as both versions were flawed: they understated the VNR and failed to implement all of the Expert Commission\u2019s rulings (such as on reference prices). By contrast, the Tribunal found that the 28 July 2008 Bates White study did incorporate all of the Expert Commission\u2019s rulings. TECO adds that Guatemala\u2019s quantum expert, Dr. Abdala, did not present an alternative quantification of damages based on Mr. Damonte\u2019s alternative VAD study.305\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 113-115; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 87, 88.\n\n*1.13.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n----------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe Committee considers that any error the Tribunal may have committed in its understanding and assessment of Mr. Damonte\u2019s expert testimony does not justify annulment.\n\n349.\n\nThe Committee holds that the Tribunal did not ignore the expert testimony of Mr. Damonte, but referred to it in several instances, at paragraphs 724, 726, 727, 730, 733, and 734 of the Award. If the Tribunal failed to understand and properly assess Mr. Damonte\u2019s testimony -which is in fact the essence of Guatemala\u2019s argument - that is not an error that can be corrected on annulment. Annulment is not a remedy designed to correct a tribunal\u2019s assessment of the record before it or its appreciation of the facts.\n\n350.\n\nIn addition, as TECO has rightly pointed out, it is evident from the body of the Award that the Tribunal found Mr. Damonte\u2019s evidence to be flawed in more than this respect. At paragraphs 730-732, the Tribunal expressly found that it could not reply upon Mr. Damonte\u2019s evidence with respect to the VNR.\n\n351.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that annulment of the Award on this ground is not warranted.\n\n**1.14 Failure to state reasons on the decision on costs (Article 52(1)(e))**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1.14.1 Guatemala\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n352.\n\nGuatemala contends that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on costs should be annulled for failure to state reasons.\n\n353.\n\nFirst, Guatemala argues that the Tribunal failed to provide any explanation for its holding that TECO\u2019S costs of over USD 10 million were justified and appropriate. The Tribunal made no attempt to look at the duration of the proceedings (2.5 years, with no bifurcation) or even at Guatemala\u2019s own legal costs, which were about 50 percent lower even though Guatemala had also employed the services of international and local legal counsel.306\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Memorial, at 226; Guatemala\u2019s Reply, at 182, 183.\n\n354.\n\nSecond, Guatemala contends that there is a contradiction between, on the one hand, the Tribunal\u2019s statement that it would apply the principle that *costs follow the event* with respect to costs, and, on the other hand, its decision to order Guatemala to pay 75 percent of TECO\u2019S costs. Guatemala argues that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on costs is in contrast with the fact that TECO had failed in most of its substantive claims (including those based on legitimate expectations, changes to the regulatory framework etc.) and had prevailed only in one of such claims (arbitrariness and lack of due process), while on damages it prevailed in less than 10 percent of its claims. According to Guatemala, there is no correlation between the principle that *costs follow the event* and the amount of costs Guatemala was ordered to pay. In addition, Guatemala claims that it is only in exceptional circumstances that investment treaty tribunals order one party to pay the other\u2019s costs and that no such circumstances existed in this case.307\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Reply, at 184, 185.\n\n*1.14.2 TECO\u2019s Position*\n------------------------\n\n355.\n\nTECO first contends that an ICSID tribunal\u2019s decision on costs is within its discretion and, as a result, it cannot be annulled. TECO invokes in this respect the annulment decisions in *MINE* v. *Guinea, CDC* v. *Seychelles* and *Iberdrola* v. *Guatemala,* where the *ad hoc* committees ruled that tribunals enjoy discretion when allocating costs. According to TECO, Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention cannot be invoked as a ground for annulling decisions on costs. There are no recorded cases of an *ad hoc* committee annulling a tribunal\u2019s determination with respect to cost allocation (with the exception of cases where the award itself or other relevant portions thereof were annulled as well). A tribunal\u2019s discretion with regard to the allocation of costs is also established in the CAFTA-DR\u2019s Article 10.26.1.308\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 119-121, 128; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 92.\n\n356.\n\nTECO adds that, in any event, the Tribunal\u2019s decision on costs was supported by clear and internally consistent reasoning, as the Tribunal: (i) discussed the legal basis for its decision; (ii) summarized the Parties\u2019 positions on this issue; (iii) indicated that the Parties\u2019 costs were justified and appropriate in view of the complexity of the case; (iv) indicated that the Tribunal would apply the *costs follow the event* principle; (v) concluded that TECO had been successful on jurisdiction and in establishing Guatemala\u2019s liability, with Guatemala being partially successful on quantum; and (vi) allocated costs on that basis. TECO disputes Respondent\u2019s contention that Guatemala prevailed in most of the merits issues as well as in 90 percent of the damages claim, and that this is in contradiction with the Tribunal\u2019s decision to order Guatemala to pay 75% of TECO\u2019S costs. According to TECO, the Tribunal\u2019s findings were that TECO was successful on jurisdiction and liability, whereas Guatemala was partially successful on quantum. The Tribunal\u2019s allocation of costs is fully consistent with these findings. In any event, TECO considers that there is no requirement under the CAFTA-DR, under the ICSID Convention or under general international law that the amount of costs awarded to a party be mathematically proportional to the amount of damages sought or awarded, or to costs awarded in other cases.309\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 122-124, 129; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 92.\n\n357.\n\nTECO further disputes Guatemala\u2019s argument according to which the Tribunal failed to explain why it found TECO\u2019S costs as reasonable, especially in light of the fact that they were approximately double the costs of Guatemala. TECO refers in this respect to the Tribunal\u2019s explanation that the costs were reasonable in light of the complexity of the case and adds that: (i) Guatemala used the same counsel, witnesses and the majority of the same experts in this case as in the *Iberdrola* arbitration, which resulted in costs savings in this proceeding; (ii) TECO\u2019S costs were exacerbated by Guatemala\u2019s misconduct in the arbitration; and (iii) there is nothing surprising about a claimant incurring significantly higher costs than a respondent in an investment treaty arbitration.310\n\nTECO\u2019S Counter-Memorial, at 125-127; TECO\u2019S Rejoinder, at 92.\n\n*1.14.3 The Committee \u2019s analysis*\n----------------------------------\n\n358.\n\nThe Committee finds that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on costs should be annulled.\n\n359.\n\nOn a preliminary note, the Committee wishes to address TECO\u2019S argument according to which tribunals\u2019 decisions on costs cannot as a matter of principle be annulled on the basis of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. While the Committee completely subscribes to the principle that tribunals have discretion with regard to the allocation of costs, it cannot endorse the view that tribunals are not held by an obligation to state reasons explaining why they exercised that discretion in a certain way. Indeed, Article 52 of the ICSID Convention does not exclude decisions on costs from its sphere of application. Neither does Article 48(3) of the Convention, which provides that an award shall deal with every question submitted to the tribunal and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\n\n360.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal found the Parties\u2019 costs to be reasonable \"in view of the complexity of [the] case\".311 By applying the *costs follow the event* principle, the Tribunal decided to order Guatemala to reimburse 75% of TECO\u2019S legal costs.312 The Tribunal based this decision on its finding that \"[t]he Claimant ha[d] been successful in its arguments regarding jurisdiction, as well as in establishing Respondent\u2019s responsibility\" and that \"the Respondent ha[d] been partially successful on quantum\".313\n\nAward, at 775.\n\nAward, at 776-779\n\nAward, at 778.\n\n361.\n\nThe Committee finds that, while the Tribunal did explain its decision on the issue of costs, it was based on Guatemala having been partially successful on quantum. Following the annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the loss of value claim and on the claim for interest for the period pre-dating the sale of EEGSA (Sections **V.1.2** and **V.1.6** above), the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s finding that Guatemala was partially successful on quantum has also disappeared.\n\n362.\n\nAs a result, similarly to *MINE* v. *Guinea,* the Tribunal\u2019s decision on costs \"cannot survive the annulment of that portion of the Award with which it is inextricably linked\".314 The Committee therefore finds that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on costs should be annulled as a result of the annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the loss of value claim and on the claim for interest for the period pre-dating the sale of EEGSA.\n\n*MINE* v. *Guinea,* at 6,112.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**1.1 TECO\u2019S costs**\n--------------------\n\n363.\n\nTECO requests that the Committee order Guatemala to bear all legal fees and costs incurred by TECO in connection with these proceedings, including the fees of its counsel, translation costs, travel and other costs associated with the Hearing, the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee, and the charges for using the facilities of the Centre.315\n\nC-SC, at 2.\n\n364.\n\nFirst, TECO contends that it is entitled to an award of costs in light of the lack of merits of Guatemala\u2019s Application and the merit of TECO\u2019S Application. TECO invokes *WtQAlapli* v. *Turkey* and *Sempra* v. *Argentina* annulment decisions as support for its position that, where a respondent State has violated its treaty obligations and unsuccessfully sought to annul an award issued against it, or where an applicant has successfully annulled an award in whole or in part, the principle *costs follow the event* should be applied, with the successful party being awarded all or a portion of its costs.316\n\nC-SC, at 3-7.\n\n365.\n\nSecond, TECO argues that it is entitled to an award of costs due to Guatemala\u2019s procedural misconduct, which unnecessarily increased its costs in these proceedings. According to TECO, Guatemala made arguments derived from evidence which had been expressly stricken from the record by the Tribunal in the underlying arbitration, and submitted new factual exhibits that were not part of the record in the underlying arbitration, without the Committee\u2019s approval and without giving TECO an opportunity to respond. Despite the Committee\u2019s letter dated 18 March 2015 striking from the record all references to this evidence and finding that Guatemala had failed to comply with Procedural Order No. 1, Guatemala continued to refer to the stricken material at the hearing.317\n\nC-SC, at 8-12.\n\n366.\n\nFinally, TECO submits that it should not be required to bear the costs incurred by Guatemala with respect to its request for the stay of enforcement of the Award. According to TECO, its application that the stay of enforcement of the Award be lifted or be conditioned upon a posting of a bond had been triggered by the press article purporting to relay a statement by the President of Guatemala that Guatemala would not comply with the Award due to the lack of funds. TECO considers that, in light of this statement, costs should be awarded to TECO, and not to Guatemala.318\n\nC-SC, at 13.\n\n367.\n\nTECO thus requests that it be awarded USD 1,644,642 broken down as follows:\n\n- USD 1,164,756.32 White & Case legal fees and expenses for both Applications:\n\no USD 687,256.11 White & Case fees for TECO\u2019S Application;\n\no USD 23,855.72 White & Case costs for TECO\u2019S Application;\n\no USD 438,538.79 White & Case fees for Guatemala\u2019s Application; and\n\no USD 15,105.7 White & Case costs for Guatemala\u2019s Application;\n\n- USD 4,885.68 TECO\u2019S arbitration expenses:\n\no USD 2,442.84 TECO\u2019S expenses for its Application; and\n\no USD 2,442.84 TECO\u2019S expenses for Guatemala\u2019s Application;\n\n- USD 475,000 as ICSID costs.319\n\nC-SC, at 14.\n\n**1.2 Guatemala\u2019s costs**\n-------------------------\n\n368.\n\nGuatemala requests that the Committee order TECO to bear Guatemala\u2019s costs in their entirety, plus compound interest assessed at a reasonable commercial rate applicable from the date of the annulment decision to the date of payment of costs.320\n\nR-SC, at 1.\n\n369.\n\nGuatemala submits that, based on Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, annulment committees have discretion to order unsuccessful applicants to pay part or all of the prevailing party\u2019s costs. The *AES* v. *Hungary321* and *Sempra* v. *Argentina* committees applied the principle *costs follow the event.* Guatemala adds that costs may be allocated taking into account whether a party has raised unmeritorious objections.322\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Erdmii Kft.* v. *Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, 29 lune 2012 (Exhibit RL-53) *(\"AES* v. *Hungary\"),* at 181.\n\nR-SC, at 2-5.\n\n370.\n\nApplying this principle to the case before the Committee, Guatemala argues that, if it is successful in its defense of TECO\u2019S Application, it should be awarded the costs it incurred in this process. Guatemala contends that TECO\u2019S Application should be dismissed by the Committee as it lacks merit.323 Guatemala considers that the Committee should order TECO to bear its own costs, as well as Guatemala\u2019s costs with respect to Guatemala\u2019s Application, as that Application should prevail.324\n\nR-SC, at 6.\n\nR-SC, at 15-18.\n\n371.\n\nGuatemala adds that the Committee should bear in mind that TECO misused the annulment process to reargue the merits of its case. This effectively meant that TECO\u2019S Application was an appeal of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on the factual evidence and the findings on lost future damages, which resulted in additional costs for Guatemala that should be taken into account in the final costs award.325\n\nR-SC, at 7-9.\n\n372.\n\nGuatemala also argues that, irrespective of the Committee\u2019s decision on the merits, it should make a partial costs award in favor of Guatemala on account of TECO\u2019S attempt to remove the stay of enforcement of the Award. According to Guatemala, TECO\u2019S application was completely untenable since the CAFTA-DR mandates a stay of enforcement of any award challenged in annulment. Following the Committee\u2019s recommendation to this effect, Guatemala has kept a separate accounting for the costs it incurred in this phase of the proceedings and requests that TECO be ordered to reimburse it.326\n\nR-SC, at 10-13.\n\n373.\n\nGuatemala requests that it be awarded USD 2,228,008.75, plus compound interest, broken down as follows:\n\n- USD 1,008,508 net of taxes as fees and expenses incurred in connection with Guatemala\u2019s Application\n\no USD 1,159,300 in fees, and\n\no USD 27,180 expenses,\n\no with USD 177,972 retained by Guatemala as non-recoverable withholding tax;\n\n- USD 654,500 net of taxes as fees and expenses incurred in connection with TECO\u2019S Application\n\no USD 739,335 in fees, and\n\no USD 30,665 expenses,\n\no with USD 115,500 retained by Guatemala as non-recoverable withholding tax;\n\n- USD 115,000.75 net of taxes as fees and expenses incurred in connection with the stay of enforcement phase\n\no USD 133,855 in fees, and\n\no USD 1440 expenses,\n\no with USD 20,294.25 retained by Guatemala as non-recoverable withholding tax; and\n\n- USD 450,000 as ICSID advance payments.327\n\nR-SC. at21.\n\n**1.3 The Committee\u2019s decision**\n--------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nIn light of the provisions of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1), corroborated with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53, the Committee has discretion with regard to the allocation of costs.\n\n375.\n\nIn deciding how to allocate the costs of these annulment proceedings, the Committee has been guided by the principle that costs should follow the event if there are no indications that a different approach is called for. The Committee has identified no such indications in this case.\n\n376.\n\nTECO\u2019S Application. The Committee notes that TECO has won on the majority of its requests. Both its request to annul the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the loss of value claim and the decision on interest accruing in the period before the sale of EEGSA were granted. TECO has lost however in its endeavor to annul the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the interest rate applicable to pre-Award interest.\n\n377.\n\nHowever, the errors which led to the partial annulment of the Award were not made by Guatemala, but by the Tribunal. Considering that both Parties participated equally in the appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Committee considers that the burden of the Tribunal having committed annullable errors should be borne by the Parties equally.\n\n378.\n\nConsequently, with regard to TECO\u2019S Application, the Committee decides that each Party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses and that the costs of the annulment proceeding (i.e. the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and of the ICSID Secretariat) shall be shared equally by both Parties.\n\n379.\n\nSince, in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, TECO has been solely responsible for the advance payments to cover the fees and expenses of the Committee and ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses, Guatemala shall reimburse TECO half of the costs of this annulment proceeding 60 days after they have been definitely confirmed by ICSID in a Final Financial Statement of the case account, to be notified to the Parties as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\n380.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s Application. The Committee notes that, with the exception of Guatemala\u2019s request for the annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on costs, the remainder of Guatemala\u2019s Application has been dismissed. However, Guatemala was successful on its Request for a Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n\n381.\n\nThe Committee therefore decides that Guatemala shall bear the costs of the annulment proceeding and that it shall reimburse TECO for 60% of its legal costs and expenses. Thus, Guatemala shall reimburse TECO the amount of USD 273,652.39 (representing 60% of the total USD 456,087.33 of TECO\u2019S legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with Guatemala\u2019s Application).\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n382.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committee decides as follows:\n\n(1) Pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, decides to annul the Award\u2019s decision on damages for the loss of value claim, as reflected in paragraphs C and G of the *dispositif* of the Award of 19 December 2013 and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (paragraphs 743-761);\n\n(2) Pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, decides to annul the Award\u2019s decision on interest on historical damages for the period August 1, 2009 until October 21, 2010, as reflected in paragraphs D and G of the *dispositif* of the Award and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (paragraphs 765, 768);\n\n(3) As a result of the above annulment, decides to annul the Award\u2019s decision on costs, as reflected in paragraph F of the *dispositif* of the Award and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to costs (paragraphs 769-779);\n\n(4) Dismisses the other grounds of TECO\u2019S Application for the Partial Annulment of the Award rendered on 19 December 2013;\n\n(5) Dismisses the other grounds of Guatemala\u2019s Application for the Annulment of the Award rendered on 19 December 2013;\n\n(6) Decides that each Party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with TECO\u2019S Application for the Partial Annulment of the Award;\n\n(7) Decides that Guatemala shall reimburse TECO half of ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses in connection with TECO\u2019S Application for the Partial Annulment of the Award, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee, and of the Committee\u2019s Assistant;\n\n(8) Decides that Guatemala shall bear the full costs and expenses incurred by ICSID in connection with Guatemala\u2019s Application for the Annulment of the Award, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee;\n\n(9) Decides that Guatemala shall reimburse TECO the amount of USD 273,652.39, representing 60% of the total USD 456,087.33 of TECO\u2019S legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with Guatemala\u2019s Application for the Annulment of the Award;\n\n(10) Notes that the stay of enforcement of the Award terminates automatically as of the date of this Decision pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(3);\n\n(11) Dismisses all other claims."}, {"Title": "Award (Resubmission Proceeding)", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2020-05-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award (Resubmission Proceeding)\n-------------------------------\n\n**Table of Selected Abbreviations/Defined Terms**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings [2006] |\n| c-[#] | Claimant\u2019s Exhibit |\n| Counter-Memorial | Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial dated 2 February 2018 |\n| CNEE | National Electric Energy Commission |\n| Decision on Annulment | Decision on Annulment in *TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v*. *The Republic of Guatemala* |\n| DEOCSA | Distribuidora El\u00e9ctrica de Occidente S.A. |\n| DEORSA | Distribuidora El\u00e9ctrica de Oriente S.A. |\n| DR-CAFTA or Treaty | Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement |\n| EEGSA | Empresa El\u00e9ctrica de Guatemala, S.A. |\n| EPM | Empresas P\u00fablicas de Medellin E.S.P. |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18, 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| LGE | General Electricity Law |\n| Memorial | Claimant\u2019s Memorial dated 1 September 2017 |\n| Navigant Report I | Expert Report of Brent C.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute resubmitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\"**) on the basis of *the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement* **(\"DR-CAFTA\"** or the **\"Treaty\"**), which entered into force in Guatemala on 1 July 2006, and in the United States on 1 March 2006, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the **\"ICSID Convention\").** The dispute relates to the operation of an electricity distribution company in Guatemala, and arose from the alleged violation by the regulatory body for the electricity sector in Guatemala, the National Electric Energy Commission (the **\"CNEE\",** from its name in Spanish, *Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica),* of the regulatory framework for setting tariffs for distribution of energy by EEGSA, the electricity company in which the Claimant had an indirect share.\n\n**A. The Claimant**\n-------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe claimant is TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC (**\"TECO\"** or the **\"Claimant\"**), a limited liability company established in 2005 under the laws of the state of Delaware in the United States of America.1 TECO is a subsidiary entirely owned by TECO Energy Inc. (**\"TECO ENERGY\"**), a parent company established under the laws of the state of Florida, United States of America.2\n\n*TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23, Award, 19 December 2013, para. 1, (the **\"Original Award\").**\n\nIbid para. 2.\n\n3.\n\nThrough a joint venture with Iberdrola Energ\u00eda, S.A. (**\"Iberdrola\"**), and Electricidade de Portugal, S.A. (**\"EDP\"**), TECO indirectly held a 24% ownership interest in Empresa El\u00e9ctrica de Guatemala, S.A. (**\"EEGSA\").**\n\n4.\n\nEEGSA is Guatemala\u2019s largest electricity distribution company. Under Ministerial Agreement No. OM-158-98 of 2 April 1998 and the Authorization Agreement of 15 May 1998, the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Guatemala (**\"MEM\"**) authorized EEGSA to distribute electricity in the departments of Guatemala, Sacatep\u00e9quez, and Escuintla for a period of 50 years. Following the privatization of EEGSA, under Ministerial Agreement No. OM-32-99 of 11 January 1999 and an Authorization Agreement of 2 February 1999, MEM also authorized EEGSA to distribute electricity in the departments of Chimaltenango, Santa Rosa and Jalapa for a period of 50 years.3\n\nIbid para. 4.\n\n5.\n\nTECO, Iberdrola, and EDP maintained an approximate 81% controlling interest in EEGSA since 1998 - first through the consortium Distribuci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Centro-Americana, S.A. (**\"DECA I\"**), and later through a successor entity referred to as **DECA II** (Distribuci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Centroamerica Dos (II), S.A.).4 Although a majority of the shares in EEGSA was transferred to private hands in 1998, the Republic has retained a stake in the distribution company.\n\nIbid para. 6.\n\n6.\n\nIn 2010, DECA II sold its shares in EEGSA to the Colombian firm Empresas P\u00fablicas de Medell\u00edn E.S.P. (**\"EPM\").5**\n\nIbid para. 8.\n\n**B. The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe respondent is The Republic of Guatemala (**\"Guatemala\"** or the **\"Respondent\").**\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the **\"Parties\".** The Parties\u2019 representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**C. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n9.\n\nAs indicated above, this dispute relates to certain measures taken by the CNEE, in establishing in 2008 the tariffs for the distribution of electricity for the five-year period 2008-2013 for EEGSA. A fuller account of the factual background is set out below.6\n\nParas 44-50, below.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Original Arbitration**\n-------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal in the foregoing arbitration proceeding (the **\"Original Arbitration\"**) presided over by Mr. Alexis Mourre, and also comprising Prof. William W. Park and Dr. Claus von Wobeser (the **\"Original Tribunal\"**) rendered the Original Award on 19 December 2013. The Original Tribunal found: (i) that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to decide on TECO\u2019s claims under the DR-CAFTA; (ii) that Guatemala had violated its obligation to accord TECO\u2019s investment in the Guatemalan electricity distribution company EEGSA fair and equitable treatment under Article 10.5 of the DR-CAFTA7; (iii) that Guatemala shall pay US$21,100,552 to TECO as compensation for damages for the period from the date of Guatemala\u2019s breach (1 August 2008, when the CNEE imposed its tariffs) until 21 October 2010 when TECO sold its ownership interest in EEGSA (**\"historical damages\")**8;  (iv) that such amount will bear interest at the US Prime rate plus a 2 percent premium as from 21 October 2010 until the date of full payment9; (v) that interest shall be compounded on an annual basis; and (vi) that Guatemala shall support the entirety of its costs and expenses and pay US$7,520,695.39 to TECO on account of 75 percent of the costs and fees incurred by TECO in the arbitration10. The Tribunal, however, denied TECO\u2019s claim for damages suffered as a result of the impaired value at which TECO sold its ownership interest in EEGSA (**\"loss of value damages\").11** The Tribunal also denied TECO\u2019s claim for interest for the period preceding the sale.12\n\nOriginal Award, para. 780.\n\nIbid paras. 742 and 780.\n\nIbid paras. 780 and 765.\n\nIbid paras. 779 and 780.\n\nIbid paras. 761 and 780.\n\nIbid paras. 765 and 780.\n\n**B. The Annulment Proceeding**\n-------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nGuatemala submitted an application for annulment of the Original Award, including annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s rulings on jurisdiction, liability, damages, and costs13. TECO submitted an application for partial annulment of the Original Award, seeking to annul the portion of the Award denying TECO loss of value damages, as well as interest for the period preceding the sale and the applicable interest rate.14\n\n*TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v. Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23, Decision on Annulment, 5 April 2016, para. 1, (the **\"Decision on Annulment\").**\n\nDecision on Annulment, para. 1.\n\n12.\n\nIn its Decision on Annulment dated 5 April 2016, the *ad hoc* Committee presided over by Prof. Bernard Hanotiau, and also comprising Ms. Tinuade Oyekunle and Prof. Klaus Sachs (the **\"*****ad** **hoc*** **Committee\"** or the **\"Committee\"**) denied Guatemala\u2019s application in its entirety and partially granted TECO\u2019s application, annulling the portions of the Original Award in which the Tribunal had denied TECO\u2019s claims for loss of value damages15 and interest for the period preceding the sale (from 1 August 2009 until 21 October 2010), but denied the annulment of the applicable interest rate. In addition, the *ad hoc* Committee annulled the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on costs, holding that, because Guatemala\u2019s partial success in the arbitration on damages was annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s Decision, the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s allocation of costs (namely, that costs follow the event, and that Guatemala should bear 75 percent of the costs and fees incurred by TECO in the arbitration) also fell away.16\n\nIbid para. 382.\n\nIbid paras. 361, 362 and 382.\n\n**C. The Resubmission**\n-----------------------\n\n13.\n\nOn 23 September 2016, ICSID received a Request for Resubmission to Arbitration dated 23 September 2016 from TECO against Guatemala (the **\"Request\").**\n\n14.\n\nTECO resubmitted to arbitration the following aspects of its dispute with Guatemala: (i) its claim for loss of value damages allegedly suffered as a result of the impaired value at which TECO sold its investment in EEGSA as a consequence of Guatemala\u2019s breach, (ii) its claim for interest on the historical damages allegedly suffered by TECO (compounded through payment) accruing in the period from 1 August 2009 until the date of TECO\u2019s sale of its interest in EEGSA on 21 October 2010, and (iii) its claim for costs and fees in connection with the original arbitration proceeding.17\n\nRequest for Resubmission, para. 24.\n\n15.\n\nOn 3 October 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID (**\"Secretary-General\"**) registered the Request in accordance with Article 55 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (**\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"**) and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible, in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings and Rule 55 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n16.\n\nPursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(2)(d), the tribunal in a resubmitted arbitration is to comprise the same number of arbitrators and be appointed by the same method as the original tribunal. In the present case, the Original Tribunal was constituted pursuant to Article 10.19 of the DR-CAFTA and Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. As such, the Original Tribunal comprised three arbitrators, one appointed by each of the disputing parties and the presiding arbitrator appointed by the agreement of the disputing parties, and, failing such agreement, by the ICSID Secretary-General.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Prof. Vaughan Lowe QC, a British national, President, appointed by Secretary-General pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.19.3 and Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention; Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, a Bulgarian national, appointed by the Claimant; and Prof. Brigitte Stem, a French national, appointed by the Respondent (the **\"Tribunal\").**\n\n18.\n\nOn 8 February 2017, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 3 April 2017, by teleconference.\n\n20.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 4 April 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia,* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, except to the extent modified and/or supplemented by the DR-CAFTA, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out the agreed schedule for the merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n21.\n\nOn 4 April 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit an agreed proposal on a Confidentiality Agreement applicable to the resubmitted case. This was followed by (i) Respondent\u2019s response of 19 April 2017, (ii) Claimant\u2019s communication and proposal of 20 April 2017, (iii) a letter from the Tribunal of 21 April 2017, (iv) Claimant\u2019s communication of 3 May 2017, requesting the Tribunal to issue a procedural order to extend/reimpose the Parties\u2019 2012 Confidentiality Agreement for the purposes of the present proceeding with respect to the documents to which it was applicable as of 19 December 2013, and (v) the Respondent\u2019s observations of 4 May 2017.\n\n22.\n\nOn 5 May 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the confidentiality of documents, deciding to extend/reimpose the Original Confidentiality Agreement (\"Annex A\" to the Procedural Order) for the purposes of the present resubmitted arbitration proceeding, but only in respect of the documents to which it was applicable as of 19 December 2013 (the date of the original Award), referenced in the original proceedings as: \"R-128, R-126, C-353 and C-354 corresponding to Respondent\u2019s Redfern Schedule categories C1, C3 and E2\"; and to address any question of confidentiality arising in relation to other documents if and when it arises.\n\n23.\n\nOn 22 May 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 which amends Procedural Order No. 1 in its Articles 13.1 through 13.4, as agreed by the Parties, in accordance with the wording reflected in Annex A to the Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n24.\n\nOn 1 September 2017, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits (**\"Memorial\"**), together with (i) the Third Expert Report of Brent C. Kaczmarek, valuation and damages expert and Managing Director of Navigant Consulting, Inc., (ii) Navigant Appendices, (iii) Claimant\u2019s Exhibits C-1001 to C-1285, (iv) Claimant\u2019s Legal Authorities CL-1001 to CL-1070, (v) Claimant\u2019s Memorial Fact Exhibit Index and (vi) Claimant\u2019s Memorial Legal Authorities Index.\n\n25.\n\nOn 2 February 2018, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the merits (**\"Counter-Memorial\"**), together with (i) the Witness Statement of Eng. Miguel Antonio Santizo Pacheco, (ii) Expert Report by Manuel A. Abdala and Juli\u00e1n M. Delamer, (iii) Exhibits R-1001 to R-1092, (iv) Legal Authorities RL-1001 to RL-1035, (v) Index of Factual Exhibits and (vi) Index of Legal Authorities.\n\n26.\n\nOn 30 May 2018, the Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits (**\"Reply\"**), together with (i) the Fourth Expert Report of Brent C. Kaczmarek, (ii) Navigant Appendices, (iii) Exhibits C-1286 to C-1317, (iv) Legal Authorities CL-1071 to CL-1096, (v) Exhibits Index and (vi) Legal Authorities Index.\n\n27.\n\nOn 26 September 2018, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits (**\"Rejoinder\"**), together with (i) Appendix I, (ii) Second Witness Statement of Eng. Miguel Antonio Santizo Pacheco, (iii) Second Expert Report by Manuel A. Abdala and Juli\u00e1n M. Delamer, (iv) Exhibits R-1093 to R-1112, (v) Legal Authorities RL-1036 to RL-1044, (vi) Index of Factual Exhibits and (vii) Index of Legal Authorities.\n\n28.\n\nOn 3 December 2018, Claimant called for cross-examination Respondent\u2019s Quantum Expert, Dr. Abdala, noting that if pursuant to the second sentence of Section 20.3, of Procedural Order No. 1, Respondent designated its witness Mr. Santizo to testify, Claimant reserved its right to cross-examine him. On the same date, Respondent called Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek from Navigant Consulting, Inc. for cross-examination.\n\n29.\n\nOn 4 December 2018, pursuant to Section 20.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, Respondent designated its witness Mr. Miguel Antonio Santizo Pacheco to testify at the hearing.\n\n30.\n\nOn 13 December 2018, the Claimant filed a request seeking leave from the Tribunal to submit an Opinion issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on 20 September 2018 denying Guatemala\u2019s motion to dismiss TECO\u2019s petition to confirm the Award (the **\"Opinion\").**\n\n31.\n\nOn 23 January 2019, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimant\u2019s request of 13 December 2018 and sought leave from the Tribunal to complete the record once the tariff reviews of Distribuidora El\u00e9ctrica de Oriente, S.A. (**\"DEORSA\"**) and Distribuidora El\u00e9ctrica de Occidente, S.A. (**\"DEOCSA\"**) are completed, with the relevant VAD studies and the corresponding CNEE Resolutions.\n\n32.\n\nOn 24 January 2019, at the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, each Party filed a letter regarding their disputed items to be addressed during the Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting, including Claimant\u2019s observations on the Respondent\u2019s request for the admissibility of new evidence of 23 January 2019.\n\n33.\n\nOn 25 January 2019, (i) the Tribunal granted Claimant\u2019s request to submit the Opinion to the Tribunal, and (ii) regarding Respondent\u2019s request of 23 January 2019 to submit as new evidence certain documents which appear not to exist as yet, the Tribunal decided that it would be addressed as and when the application is made.\n\n34.\n\nOn 8 February 2019, Respondent noted Claimant\u2019s decision not to seek to cross-examine its witness, Mr. Miguel Santizo, and in light of that decision and the fact that the 2018-23 tariff review of DEORSA and DEOCSA had not been completed, Respondent had concluded that there was little practical use in incurring the considerable cost of presenting Mr. Santizo at the hearing. Respondent expressed its belief that Mr. Santizo\u2019s testimony was crucial to the issues in dispute and reserved its right to rely on his written statements during the hearing.\n\n35.\n\nOn 11 February 2019, the President held a Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n36.\n\nOn 14 February 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the organization of the hearing.\n\n37.\n\nOn 1 March 2019, pursuant to Section D of Procedural Order No. 4 of 14 February 2019, the Respondent indicated that both Dr. Abdala and Mr. Delamer would appear for examination at the hearing and Dr. Abdala would act as lead expert. This was followed by (i) Claimant\u2019s letter of 2 March 2019 requesting the Tribunal to confirm, for the reasons indicated therein, that only Dr. Abdala and not Mr. Delamer, may be examined at the hearing; (ii) Respondent\u2019s comments of 4 March 2019; and (iii) Respondent\u2019s letter of 5 March 2019.\n\n38.\n\nOn 6 March 2019, for the reasons indicated therein, the Tribunal decided that both Dr. Abdala and Mr Delamer may appear at the hearing for examination, in accordance with paragraph 14 of Procedural Order No. 4. The Tribunal invited Respondent to indicate precisely the sections of the reports to which Mr. Delamer contributed as a co-author, which Respondent did by letter of 6 March 2019.\n\n39.\n\nOn 8 March 2019, Claimant requested leave from the Tribunal to refer during the hearing to a new fact, an ongoing expert commission process in respect of DEOCSA\u2019s and DEORSA\u2019s 2018-2023 tariff review and, to the extent disputed, introduce newly, publicly-available evidence to support that fact.\n\n40.\n\nA hearing on the Merits was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. from 11 March to 14 March 2019.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n44.\n\nIn essence, in the 1990s, Guatemala decided to privatise the assets of its electrical distribution industry, including *Empresa El\u00e9ctrica de Guatemala SA* **(\"EEGSA\"**), Guatemala\u2019s largest electricity distribution company. As recommended by consultants advising on the privatisation, Guatemala adopted a new legal and regulatory framework for the industry. The new General Electricity Law (**\"LGE\"**) and Regulations relating to the LGE (**\"RLGE\"**) were adopted in 1996. They set out rules for regulating electricity process and established a new body, the *Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Energia El\u00e9ctrica* (**\"CNEE\"**) for the sector. The key innovation was the introduction of a depoliticized tariff review system and the limitation of the role of the CNEE in the calculation of a the \"Value Added for Distribution\" (**\"VAD\"**), a component in the calculation of the tariff which compensates the electricity distributor for both its operating costs and its capital costs and permits a reasonable return on invested capital, and which is the crucial determinant of the distributor\u2019s profits.\n\n45.\n\nUnder the new regulatory regime, the VAD was calculated not by reference to the actual costs incurred by the distributor but by the costs of a hypothetical benchmark efficient company.18 The calculation used the \u2018new replacement value\u2019 of assets (\"VNR\") approach to the costs, which was particularly important for companies such as EEGS A which needed to replace aged equipment.\n\nLGE Article 71.\n\n46.\n\nThe VAD was to be recalculated every five years; and the specific procedure was important. Distributors, including EEGSA, recalculated their own VAD \"through a study entrusted to an engineering firm prequalified by the [CNEE]\".19 The distributor had to choose the firm from a list drawn up by the CNEE.20 The CNEE was to review the VAD calculation and put forward \u2018corrections\u2019 to it, which would either be accepted or, if contested by the distributor, referred to a neutral three-person Expert Commission for decision. Only in two circumstances was the CNEE entitled to make its own calculation of the VAD: if (i) the distributor did not deliver its own study, or (ii) the distributor did not correct its study according to the LGE and RLGE.21\n\nLGE Article 74.\n\nRLGE Article 97.\n\nRLGE Article 98; cf., Award, paras. 522-527; LGE Articles 71-79.\n\n47.\n\nThose were the key components of the regime in place when EEGSA was privatised. In 1998, Guatemala sold 80.88% of EEGSA for US$ 520 million to a group of investors including a subsidiary of the group TECO ENERGY, together with *Iberdrola Energia S.A.* (**\"Iberdrola\"**) and *Electricida.de de Portugal S.A.* **(\"EDP\").** The investors acted through the Guatemalan company *Distribuci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Centro-Americana S.A* **(\"DECA I\").** In 1999, DECA I was absorbed by EEGSA, and another Guatemalan company, *Distribuci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica Centro-Americana 2 S.A* **(\"DECA II\"**), was created, which became the owner of 80% of the capital of EEGSA. The TECO interest in the capital of DECA II, which was eventually transferred to Claimant, amounted to 30%, with the remaining capital held by Iberdrola (49%) and EDP (21%).22\n\nDecision on Annulment, para. 38.\n\n48.\n\nThe initial VAD, set for the First Tariff Period 1998-2003, was a \u2018placeholder tariff based on a VAD study from El Salvador, considered to be similar to Guatemala in this context.23 The tariff was reviewed after five years in accordance with the procedure in the LGE and RLGE, and set for the Second Tariff Period, 2003-2008.24\n\nTr. Day 1, 15-22.\n\nTr. Day 1, 17.\n\n49.\n\nThe dispute arose from the setting of the VAD for the Third Tariff Period, 2008-2013. EEGSA delivered its VAD study, commissioned from the CNEE-approved consultants Bates White, in good time, at the end of March 2008.25 The CNEE indicated that certain corrections should be made. Bates White amended the study in May 2008, but the CNEE considered that not all of the necessary amendments had been made. EEGSA disagreed, and the matter was considered by an Expert Commission which, on 25 July 2008, ruled against the CNEE on several key points while ruling in favour of the CNEE on many other points. On 28 July 2008, Bates White submitted a revised report incorporating most but not all of the Expert Commission rulings. The CNEE considered the revised Bates White study to be unreliable and rejected it and proceeded on 29 July 2008 to set tariffs on the basis of VAD calculations made by the CNEE\u2019s own consultants, Sigla. Those tariffs were lower than the tariffs that would have resulted from application of the Bates White calculations (amended in accordance with part of the Expert Commission\u2019s determinations); and TGH considered that this was because Respondent did not want to raise electricity prices but rather wanted to decrease them significantly for political reasons.26\n\nOriginal Award, para. 535.\n\nTr. Day 1, 22.\n\n50.\n\nIn the resulting dispute, Claimant argued the CNEE had no right to disregard the Bates White VAD study and apply its own unilateral VAD study. Respondent took the position that it was entitled to insist on all of the corrections to the Bates White study that the CNEE had indicated being applied to EEGSA\u2019s VAD study, and that because that had not been done it had the right to disregard the Bates White study and apply the VAD calculated in the Sigla study.27 Claimant, in contrast, said that under the regulatory regime only the CNEE corrections approved by the Expert Commission had to be applied.\n\nOriginal Award, paras. 537-539.\n\n51.\n\nThis is the dispute that was submitted to arbitration under the auspices of ICSID by a Request for Arbitration dated 20 October 2010; and the Original Award was issued on 19 December 2013. In the meantime, in October 2010, DECA II sold its shares in EEGSA to the Colombian company, *Empresas P\u00fablicas de Medellin E.S.P.* **(\"EPM\"**), for US$ 605 million.\n\n52.\n\nThe respective Requests for Relief of the Parties in that initial hearing of the case were recorded as follows:\n\n**\"A. Claimant\u2019s requests for relief**\n\n434. In its July 8, 2013 Post-Hearing Reply, the Claimant requested that the Arbitral Tribunal issue an Award:\n\n1. Finding that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the Claimant's claim arising under Article 10.5 of DR-CAFTA;\n\n2. Finding that Respondent has breached its obligation under Article 10.5 of the DR-CAFTA to accord Claimant\u2019s investment in EEGSA fair and equitable treatment;\n\n3. Ordering Respondent to pay compensation to Claimant in the amount of US$243.6 million;\n\n4. Ordering the Respondent to pay interest on the above amount at 8.8 percent, compounded from 1 August 2008 until full payment has been made; and\n\n5. Ordering Respondent to pay Claimant's legal fees and costs incurred in these proceedings.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s requests for relief**\n\n435. In its July 8, 2013 Post-Hearing Reply, the Respondent requested that the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n1. Declare that it does not have jurisdiction over the claim filed by TGH;\n\n2. Alternatively and subsidiarily, to reject each and every one of the claims made by TGH on their merits; and, in addition to either case;\n\n3. Grant any other compensation to Guatemala that the Tribunal deems appropriate and fair; and\n\n4. Order that TGH pay all costs of these arbitration proceedings, including the fees and costs of the Tribunal and ICSID as well as all fees and costs incurred by Guatemala for its legal representation in this arbitration, with interest prior and subsequent to the award being issued until the date of actual payment.\"28\n\nOriginal Award, paras. 434, 435.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal that delivered the Original Award decided that\n\n\"although the conclusions of the Expert Commission were not technically binding upon the CNEE, the CNEE had the duty to seriously consider them and to provide its reasons in case it would decide to disregard them.\n\n... the distributor was under no obligation to incorporate in its VAD study observations made by the CNEE in respect of which there was a disagreement properly submitted to the Expert Commission. Unless the regulator provided valid reasons to the contrary, it is only if and when the Expert Commission had pronounced itself in favor of the regulator that such an obligation would arise.\"29\n\nOriginal Award, paras. 588, 589.\n\n54.\n\nThe Original Tribunal found that the CNEE\n\n\"has repudiated the two fundamental principles upon which the regulatory framework bases the tariff review process: first that, save in the limited cases provided in Article 98 RLGE the tariff would be based on the VAD study prepared by the distributor\u2019s consultant; and, second, that any disagreement between the regulator and the distributor regarding such VAD study would be resolved by having regard to the pronouncements of a neutral Expert Commission.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal finds that such repudiation of the two fundamental regulatory principles applying to the tariff review process is arbitrary and breaches elementary' standards of due process in administrative matters. Such behavior therefore breaches Guatemala\u2019s obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment under article 10.5 of [the] CAFTA-DR.... [T]he Arbitral Tribunal finds that such breach has caused damages to the Claimant, in respect of which the Claimant is entitled to compensation.\"30\n\nOriginal Award, paras. 710, 711.\n\n55.\n\nIn the original proceeding, Claimant had sought damages under two heads: (i) the \u2018historical losses\u2019, amounting to US$ 21,100,552, being its portion of the cash flow lost by EEGSA from August 2008 until October 2010 when EEGSA was sold to EPM as a result of the application of a tariff based on the Sigla study; and (ii) the \u2018loss of value\u2019, amounting to US$ 222,484,783, being the losses resulting from the depressed value at which it sold its shares in October 2010.31\n\nOriginal Award, paras. 716, 717.\n\n56.\n\nThe Original Tribunal awarded Claimant US$ 21,100,552 in respect of the historical losses.32 In relation to the \u2018loss of value\u2019 claim, the Original Tribunal found that the breach by CNEE of the regulatory framework played an important role in TECO\u2019s decision to divest, but found no sufficient evidence of the existence and quantum of the losses that were allegedly suffered as a consequence of the sale.33 The claim for loss of value was accordingly rejected.34 The Original Tribunal awarded pre- and post-award interest on the damages awarded at the US Prime rate of interest plus a 2% premium, compounded on an annual basis, from 21 October 2010 until full payment.35 Applying the principle that costs follow the event, the Original Tribunal decided that Respondent would support the entirety of its costs and reimburse 75% of the costs supported by Claimant, *i.e.,* US$ 7,520,695.39.36\n\nOriginal Award, para. 742.\n\nOriginal Award, paras. 748, 749.\n\nOriginal Award, para. 761.\n\nOriginal Award, para. 768.\n\nOriginal Award, para. 779.\n\n57.\n\nThe *dispositif* of the Original Award read as follows:\n\n\"780. The Arbitral Tribunal decides:\n\nA. That it has jurisdiction to decide on Teco\u2019s claims under the CAFTA-DR;\n\nB. That Guatemala has violated its obligation to accord to Teco\u2019s investment Fair and Equitable Treatment under Article 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR;\n\nC. That Guatemala shall pay US$21,100,552 to Teco as damages;\n\nD. That the amount mentioned in section C above will bear interest at the US Prime rate plus a 2 percent premium as from October 21, 2010 until the date of full payment;\n\nE. That interest shall be compounded on an annual basis;\n\nF. That Guatemala shall support the entirety of its costs and expenses and pay US$ US$7,520,695.39 to Teco on account of its legal costs and expenses;\n\nG. That all any other claims and pleas for relief are rejected.\"\n\n58.\n\nAs was noted above, on 18 April 2014, Respondent submitted an application for annulment of the Original Award, including annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s rulings on jurisdiction, liability, damages, and costs. On the same day, Claimant submitted an application for partial annulment of the Original Award, seeking to annul it insofar as it did not award TECO any compensation for losses arising from the sale of EEGSA on 21 October 2010 or any interest accruing in the period from 1 August 2009 until 21 October 2010, and to annul it also with respect to the interest rate applicable to pre-award interest.\n\n59.\n\nThe respective applications for annulment were recorded by the Annulment Committee in its Decision on Annulment as follows:\n\n**\"1.1 TECO\u2019s Application**\n\n29. TECO has made the following request for relief before the Committee:\n\n\"[...] TECO respectfully requests that the Committee issue a Decision:\n\n1. Partially annulling the damages section of the Award insofar as it does not award TECO any compensation for losses arising from the sale of EEGSA on 21 October 2010;\n\n2. Partially annulling the damages section of the Award insofar as it does not award TECO any interest accruing in the period from 1 August 2009 until 21 October 2010;\n\n3. Partially annulling the damages section of the Award with respect to the interest rate applicable to pre-award interest at the U.S. Prime rate plus two percent; and\n\n4. Ordering Guatemala to pay TECO\u2019s legal fees and costs incurred in these proceedings.\"\n\n30. For its part, Guatemala requests that the Committee:\n\n\"(a) Reject TGH\u2019s annulment application in full;\n\n(b) Order TGH to pay Guatemala\u2019s legal fees and costs, and all the fees and costs of the ad hoc Committee and ICSID in these proceedings, including all costs relating to the phase of these proceedings related to the stay of enforcement of the Award.\"\n\n**1.2 Guatemala\u2019s Application**\n\n31. Guatemala is seeking the following relief from the Committee:\n\n\"(a) To ANNUL the Award in its entirety or any part thereof in exercise of the Committee\u2019s power;\n\n(b) To ORDER TGH to pay all costs of these annulment proceedings, including the costs of Guatemala\u2019s representation, with interest.\"\n\n32. For its part, TECO requests \"that the Committee reject Guatemala\u2019s request for annulment of the Award and order Guatemala to pay TECO\u2019s legal fees and costs incurred in these proceedings\". [Footnotes omitted]\n\n60.\n\nIn its Decision on Annulment dated 5 April 2016 (the **\"Decision on Annulment\"**), the *ad hoc* Committee in the annulment proceedings denied Guatemala\u2019s application in its entirety and granted TECO\u2019s application (with the exception of the application with respect to the applicable interest rate), annulling the portions of the Original Award in which the Original Tribunal had denied TECO\u2019s claims for loss of value damages and interest for the period preceding the sale. In addition, the *ad hoc* Committee annulled the Original Tribunal\u2019s ruling on costs, holding that, because Guatemala\u2019s partial success in the arbitration on damages was annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s decision, the basis for the Original Tribunal\u2019s allocation of costs (namely, that costs follow the event, and that Guatemala should bear 75 percent of the costs and fees incurred by TECO in the arbitration, rather than full costs or a higher percentage of TECO\u2019s costs) also fell away.\n\n61.\n\nThe *dispositif in* the Decision on Annulment read as follows;\n\n**\"VIII. DECISION**\n\n382. For the reasons set out above, the Committee decides as follows:\n\n(1) Pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, decides to annul the Award\u2019s decision on damages for the loss of value claim, as reflected in paragraphs C and G of the dispositif of the Award of 19 December 2013 and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (paragraphs 743-761);\n\n(2) Pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, decides to annul the Award\u2019s decision on interest on historical damages for the period 1 August 2009 until 21 October 2010. as reflected in paragraphs D and G of the dispositif of the Award and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (paragraphs 765, 768);\n\n(3) As a result of the above annulment, decides to annul the Award\u2019s decision on costs, as reflected in paragraph F of the dispositif of the Award and the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to costs (paragraphs 769-779);\n\n(4) Dismisses the other grounds of TECO\u2019s Application for the Partial Annulment of the Award rendered on 19 December 2013;\n\n(5) Dismisses the other grounds of Guatemala's Application for the Annulment of the Award rendered on 19 December 2013;\n\n(6) Decides that each Party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with TECO's Application for the Partial Annulment of the Award;\n\n(7) Decides that Guatemala shall reimburse TECO half of ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses in connection with TECO's Application for the Partial Annulment of the Award, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee, and of the Committee's Assistant;\n\n(8) Decides that Guatemala shall bear the full costs and expenses incurred by ICSID in connection with Guatemala\u2019s Application for the Annulment of the Award, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee;\n\n(9) Decides that Guatemala shall reimburse TECO the amount of USD 273,652.39, representing 60% of the total USD 456,087.33 of TECO's legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with Guatemala\u2019s Application for the Annulment of the Award;\n\n(10) Notes that the stay of enforcement of the Award terminates automatically as of the date of this Decision pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(3);\n\n(11) Dismisses all other claims.\"\n\n62.\n\nOn 26 September 2016, TECO requested the resubmission of the dispute, and it was subsequently referred to the present Tribunal.\n\n**A. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the present Tribunal in this case, which is not disputed, is established by Article 52 in Chapter IV (\u2018Arbitration\u2019) of the ICSID Convention. The material provision is Article 52(6), which reads as follows:\n\n\"(6) If the award is annulled the dispute shall, at the request of either party, be submitted to a new Tribunal constituted in accordance with Section 2 of this Chapter.\"\n\n**B. The Questions to be Decided**\n----------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nIn paragraph 24 of the Request for Resubmission to Arbitration dated 23 September 2016, the requests put before the present Tribunal were summarised as follows:\n\n\"TECO hereby resubmits to arbitration the following aspects of its dispute with Guatemala: (i) its claim for loss of value damages suffered as a result of the impaired value at which TECO sold its investment in EEGSA as a consequence of Guatemala's breach, (ii) its claim for interest on the historical damages suffered by TECO (compounded through payment) accruing in the period from 1 August 2009 until the date of TECO\u2019s sale of its interest in EEGSA on 21 October 2010, and (iii) its claim for costs and fees in connection with the original arbitration proceeding.... In addition. TECO seeks an award of the costs incurred in connection with this resubmitted arbitration.\"\n\n65.\n\nThere are thus three broad issues before the Tribunal:\n\n1. The claim for damages for loss of value\n\n2. The claim for interest on the historical damages\n\n3. The allocation of the costs of the proceedings\n\nThese issues will be addressed in turn; but before turning to those issues, it is convenient to address the question of *res judicata.* In the context of this case, we mean by *'res judicata'* the matters decided by the First Tribunal that have not been annulled and which are, therefore, not within our jurisdiction to decide.\n\n**C. Res Judicata**\n-------------------\n\n66.\n\nIn its Reply, Claimant relies upon \"the *res judicata* effect of the unannulled portions of the [Original] Award.\"37 It appears to be common ground that the annulment of the Original Award in so far as it relates to the allocation of the costs of the proceedings precludes any reliance upon *res judicata* in that context. The question of *res judicata* therefore actually arises only in relation to the 'loss of value\u2019 claim and the claim for interest on historical damages.\n\nReply, para. 74. Cf., paras. 3, 42, 62, 65, 66 and 92.\n\n67.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent disputes Claimant\u2019s interpretation of the scope of the doctrine of *res judicata* as it applies in the present case and offers a legal analysis of the doctrine,38 arguing that it applies \"only to the operative part of the award, *i.e.,* the part of the award containing the decision... [and] extends to the reasons which are a necessary adjunct to decision, that is to say the *ratio decidendi* of the award.\"39 The Parties addressed the question of *res judicata* further during the hearing.40\n\nRejoinder, Sections IV.A.2-IV.A.4 (paras. 44-62).\n\nRejoinder, para. 59.\n\nTr.

Day 4. 899-900.\n\n69.\n\nRespondent, broadly speaking, takes the view that only the un-annulled part of the *dispositif* and the reasoning necessary for that part of the *dispositif* has the status of *res judicata.*44 Further, in circumstances where that reasoning was pleaded in respect of two or more distinct claims, the reasoning does not have the status of *res judicata* in relation to annulled claims that are \u2018inherently different\u2019 from those that are not annulled.45\n\nTr.

Day 4, 995.\n\n70.\n\nThis difference of views bears in particular upon the status of the assumptions made by experts in calculating the historic damages (which were allowed by the Original Tribunal and were not annulled) in the context of the claim for the 'loss of value\u2019, interest and costs claims, in relation to which the decisions of the Original Tribunal were annulled. It is those 'loss of value\u2019, interest, and costs claims that are now before the present Tribunal for decision.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is generally accepted that *res judicata* arises only in circumstances where the \"same cause\" is in issue between the two tribunals.46 It follows that the doctrine has no application so as to bind a subsequent tribunal in relation to the determination of a question that is materially different from that which formed the context in which the initial determination was made. Material difference is something that must be judged on the specific facts of each case; but its general connotation is that there is a rational basis for distinguishing between the way in which the determination might be applied in the second context as compared with its application in the context in which the determination was originally made. That conclusion follows from the essential nature of the *res judicata* doctrine, and lies at the heart of the \u2018triple identity\u2019 test - identity of parties, of cause of action, and of object47 - which is commonly understood to set the boundaries of the doctrine.\n\nB Hanotiau, '*Res judicata,* a general principle of international law recognized by civilised nations\u2019, ICC, *Complex Arbitrations - Special Supplement 2003,* para. 12 and passim; RL-1037.\n\nSee *Apotex Holdings Inc and Apotex Inc. v United States of America.* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, 25 August 2014, paras. 7.10-7.36; cited by Claimant. Tr. Day 4, 904. Cf., Decision on Annulment, para. 58.\n\n72.\n\nIn circumstances where the *res judicata* doctrine does apply, the determination made by the first tribunal is binding on the second tribunal, which must adopt the determination in question as one of the premises from which it reasons to its decision when the same question arises again. The key question, generally and in the present case, is therefore whether the question before the two tribunals is indeed \"the same\".\n\n**(1**) ***Res judicata*** **and the \u2018loss of value\u2019 claim**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Original Tribunal awarded Claimant damages for its historical losses but not for its \u2018loss of value\u2019 claim. As the Annulment Committee put it:\n\n\"67. With respect to historical losses, the Tribunal awarded TECO the amount of USD 21,100,552, consisting of TECO\u2019S share of the higher revenues that EEGSA would have received had the CNEE observed due process in the tariff review, calculated from the moment the high revenues would have been first received until the moment TECO sold its share in EEGSA. The Tribunal quantified these losses in the \u2018but for\u2019 scenario on the basis of the Bates White 28 July 2008 study, which reflected the tariffs that would have been applicable if the CNEE had complied with the regulatory framework.\n\n68. The Tribunal rejected TECO\u2019S claim for loss of value (future losses). In doing so. the Tribunal first found that TECO\u2019S decision to divest was taken primarily as a consequence of the breach by the CNEE of the regulatory framework. However, the Tribunal added that it found no sufficient evidence of the existence and quantum of the losses that were allegedly suffered as a consequence of the sale\u2019 and dismissed the claim.\"48\n\nDecision on Annulment, paras. 67, 68 (footnotes omitted).\n\n74.\n\nThe Original Tribunal thus calculated historical losses by determining (a) the actual revenues received by Claimant and deducting them from (b) the revenues that it considered would have been received by Claimant under the But-for scenario.\n\n***i. Claimant\u2019s case***\n------------------------\n\n75.\n\nClaimant\u2019s case is that enough has already been decided, with the status of *res judicata,* for the 'loss of value\u2019 damages to be calculated by a straightforward arithmetical calculation of the \u2018But-for\u2019 value of EEGSA, from which the actual value realised on the sale of EEGSA can be deducted. It says that \"the Original Tribunal did, in fact, decide the DCF inputs into the integrated DCF Model, but-for model.\"49 In Claimant\u2019s view:\n\n\"their ruling on historical loss damages is *res judicata,* but their ruling as to the proper inputs into the But-for Model, that has been decided by the Original Tribunal. It has not been annulled, so it\u2019s binding in this proceeding and can\u2019t be revisited, and that is why we say that they\u2019re really at bottom isn\u2019t much for this Tribunal to do because once you accept those inputs, the result is. in essence, inevitable, as I've shown or as I've explained because you just subtract the difference between the but-for and the actual models which have already been accepted.\"50\n\nTr. Day 4, 907: 17-19; cf., Tr. Day 1, 84, and Tr. Day 4, 903-907 *passim.*\n\nTr. Day 1, 84: 2-13.\n\n76.\n\nAs to the \u2018proper inputs\u2019, Claimant says that \"(t)here are lots of inputs, obviously; and, at the end of the day, there were only three disagreements as to those inputs.\"51 The three disagreements were described as follows:\n\n\"The first is the VNR [sc., the Replacement Value of the Assets], the asset base itself;  \nThe second was the proper FRC [sc. the Capital Recovery Factor] formula, and that's the formula that you apply to the asset base, the VNR to get your return, then a return on capital;  \nAnd then the level of capital expenditures of the Actual Company which would affect the cash flows of the company.\"52\n\nTr. Day 1, 78: 5\u20147.\n\nTr. Day 1, 79: 6-12.\n\n77.\n\nClaimant submits that the First Tribunal\u2019s determinations on these three points,53 and also the determination that Respondent\u2019s breach of the DR-CAFTA caused a loss of value to Claimant,54 all have the status of *res judicata.*\n\nTr. Day 1, 84, 103-105.\n\nTr. Day 4, 869-871, 895, 901-902, 920-922.\n\n***ii. Respondent\u2019s case***\n---------------------------\n\n78.\n\nRespondent\u2019s case is that no *res judicata* whatever arises in relation to the \u2018loss of value\u2019 claim. It suggests that it would not be possible for *res judicata* to arise because the claim for loss of value damages was dismissed by the Original Tribunal,55 but argues that in any event the First Tribunal \"had not been presented with sufficient evidence to determine whether TECO had suffered a loss of value in this amount.\"56 It says that the analyses of the historic damages claim and of the loss of value claim are different exercises, distinguishable, in that the loss of value claim depended upon the sale price of EEGSA, which is definite,57 whereas the historical damages claim was not, and the loss of value claim depends upon the building of \"a cash-flow model which has all kinds of assumptions in it: Costs, CAPEX, OPEX, Discount Rate, all kind of other things.\"58\n\nTr. Day 1, 212, 215.\n\nTr. Day 1, 214: 4-6.\n\nTr. Day 1, 214-215.\n\nTr. Day 1, 215: 2-4.\n\n***iii. Tribunal\u2019s analysis***\n------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal starts from the axiom that doctrines such as *res judicata* are aids and not obstacles to the administration of justice. *Res judicata* is clearly a powerful and useful instrument for avoiding the repetition of pleadings and decision-making that has already taken place, for securing consistency between decisions of different tribunals that are involved in different aspects of the same dispute, and in bringing finality to dispute settlement procedures. The bar on re-opening questions already definitively decided is an important principle binding upon tribunals. But it is equally clear that the doctrine of *res judicata* has limits that must be respected. The requirement that there be an identity between the causes of action in the successive procedures is very well established,59 and is particularly important here.\n\nSee para. 71, above.\n\n80.\n\nThe Annulment Committee did not annul the Original Tribunal\u2019s decisions leading to the award of historical damages; and those decisions, to the extent that they constituted necessary reasoning leading to the decision set out in the *dispositif* to award damages for the historical damages, undoubtedly had the quality of *res judicata* in relation to the historical damages claim. They do not, however, have the quality of *res judicata* in relation to the 'loss of value\u2019 claim, because the 'loss of value\u2019 claim is distinct and different from the historical damages claim.60\n\nAs the Annulment Committee accepted: see Decision on Annulment, para. 107.\n\n81.\n\nThe difference is evident from the fact that the calculation of the value that EEGSA would have had to EPM as a buyer, \u2018but for\u2019 the breaches of the DR-CAFTA, is not necessarily a straightforward arithmetical exercise involving only data used to calculate the historical damages. It cannot be assumed that historical losses suffered *by* EEGSA would inevitably lead to a reduction of precisely the same amount (adjusted for time differences, etc) in the value of EEGSA to a prospective purchaser. For example, the market for electricity might have expanded or contracted significantly over the historical period, or there might have been more or fewer potential buyers of EEGSA by the end of the period, or material shifts in the costs of distribution. Any such changes in the market conditions would be expected to affect the value of EEGSA, but would be independent of the question of EEGSA\u2019s losses.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Claimant\u2019s argument that the distinction between historical damages and loss of value damages has no legal significance because \"even if they are considered... distinct... they still all emanate from the same breach\".61 In the context of *res judicata,* the question is not whether findings relate to claims that emanate from the same breach, but whether there has been a clear determination by the first tribunal of a specific cause of action pleaded in the case, and that same cause of action is again before the second tribunal.\n\nTr. Day 1, 44: 1-3.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s view that the historical and 'loss of value\u2019 claims are significantly different from one another is reinforced by the fact that the Original Tribunal itself considered that it did not have sufficient evidence to calculate the \u2018But-for\u2019 value of EEGSA and therefore the 'loss of value\u2019 damages.62 In other words, it needed proof of some other factor or data to calculate the \u2018loss of value\u2019 damages. It cannot be the case that determinations of historical losses made by the Original Tribunal which it explicitly decided were inadequate to provide all the data necessary for the calculation of the \u2018loss of value\u2019 damages can have the status of *res judicata* for the present Tribunal and bind it in relation to the calculation of those same \u2018loss of value\u2019 damages.\n\nOriginal Award, paras. 748-761.\n\n84.\n\nFurther, as there is need for proof of some other factor or data, not available to the Original Tribunal, that other factor or data might modify the effect of the factors that were available to and decided on by the Original Tribunal. It would therefore be wrong to assume that if the new factors had been taken into account by the Original Tribunal it would have made exactly the same determinations as it did in fact make in respect of the other factors.\n\n85.\n\nThis Tribunal has therefore decided that the legal conditions for the application of the *res judicata* doctrine to determinations that might be relevant to the calculation of any Toss of value\u2019 damages in this case are not met. The Tribunal also considers that it is plainly unsafe to rule that the question of the amount of any 'loss of value\u2019 damages in this case has already been so distinctly argued and determined by the Original Tribunal that it is not only unnecessary but also impermissible for this Tribunal to hear and decide upon fresh submissions on the point. That is a further ground for this Tribunal\u2019s decision on the question of *res judicata.*\n\n86.\n\nThere is a further question, as to whether the determinations of the Original Tribunal relating not to the inputs for the \u2018But-for\u2019 calculation but to the questions of the existence of a loss of value and the causal link between any such loss and Respondent\u2019s breach of the DR-CAFTA, have the status of *res judicata.* The Tribunal considers that question to have more theoretical than practical importance. The finding that the tariffs set for the Third Tariff Period (2008-2013) caused losses - the historical damages - to EEGSA in breach of the DR-CAFTA is undoubtedly *res judicata.* Put simply, the tariffs, and thus the revenue flowing to EEGSA, were lower than they should have been. EEGSA was sold in 2010. It is axiomatic that the 2008-2013 tariffs must have been a factor in any rational valuation of EEGSA, and that the tariffs would have tended to depress the value of EEGSA below the level at which it would have been if the tariffs had been higher and expected to continue at that higher rate. That is evident, regardless of any questions of *res judicata;* but it leaves open the question of the amount (which could theoretically be zero or have a positive value or even, in theory, a negative value) of any loss of value. The Tribunal will accordingly proceed to determine that amount.\n\n**(2**) ***Res judicata*** **and the claim for interest on historical damages**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nClaimant also suggested that this Tribunal is bound not to revisit the determination of the Original Tribunal in respect of the interest payable on the historical damages.63 That point is addressed below.\n\nSee Tr. Day 1, 27-32.\n\n**(3) The claim for damages for loss of value**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n***i. Claimant\u2019s case***\n------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe claim for 'loss of value\u2019 damages is based on the proposition that\n\n\"Guatemala\u2019s unlawful acts had a significant financial impact on the value of TECO\u2019s investment in EEGSA, causing TECO to sell its interest in EEGSA at a depressed price to EPM on 21 October 2010. As demonstrated by TECO\u2019s quantum expert in the original arbitration, the loss suffered by TECO in the sale of its interest in DECA II-the company through which it held EEGSA\u2019s shares-to EPM on 21 October 2010 amounted to US$ 222,484,783 (before interest).\"64\n\nRequest for Resubmission, para. 26.\n\n89.\n\nClaimant points *inter alia* to the downgrading of EEGSA by major rating agencies in the light of the reduced tariffs as evidence of the fact that loss-of-value damage was caused by the breach.65 It argues that EPM was in effect buying \u2018damaged goods\u2019.66\n\nMemorial, paras. 41-46.\n\nTr. Day 1, 45.\n\n90.\n\nIn the Original Arbitration, Claimant used the VNR - the Replacement Value of the Assets - that had been calculated by Claimant\u2019s experts in the 2008-2013 tariff-setting process, Bates White; Respondent used the VNR calculated by its expert in that tariff-setting process, Mr Damonte.67 The ensuing disagreement in the Original Arbitration was described by Claimant as follows:\n\n\"There was a lot of argument and testimony on this. Dr. Barrera testified on behalf of Claimant, and he went through the Bates White Model step by step and showed how every single one of the Expert Commission\u2019s rulings had been incorporated into the revised model, and he showed all of that. And then he went through every single Expert Commission ruling and showed why it was reasonable and why it was in conformity with the Regulatory Framework.  \nNow. the Original Tribunal, looking at that, they noted the discrepancy in the value of the asset base, that it was 1.1 billion for Bates White. It was only 629 million for Mr. Damonte. And they said, first, they carefully reviewed the evidence, and they found that Bates White had properly incorporated the Expert Commission\u2019s rulings into its revised model.  \nAnd then, second, they said that there were no reasons to depart from the rulings of the Expert Commission.  \nNow, not only did they say that Guatemala, the CNEE failed to give reasons, they actually said that the CNEE would have had no valid reasons to disregard the rulings of the Expert Commission with respect to the VNR. So, again, Guatemala tries to narrow the liability' finding in saying, \u2018if we had just explained ourselves more thoroughly, then we would have been okay. We could have disregarded the rulings of the Expert Commission and applied the other VNR.\u2019 but that\u2019s not the case, that they made all of the arguments as to what they would have said if they had explained themselves more thoroughly, and the Tribunal said no. you would have had no reason because what the Expert Commission did comported with the Regulatory Framework, and what you were doing did not and, therefore, you could not impose that\u2014you could not calculate the tariff off of that other VNR.\"68\n\nTr. Day 1, 80.\n\nTr. Day 1, 80-81.\n\n91.\n\nClaimant submits that although the Annulment Decision quashed the Original Tribunal\u2019s findings relating to the loss of value claim, the Original Tribunal\u2019s acceptance of the Bates White VNR, which was not expressly annulled, stands and has the quality of *res judicata,*69 or is in any event correct.\n\nSee, e.g., Tr. Day 1, 83-84 and 133-137.\n\n***ii. Respondent\u2019s case***\n---------------------------\n\n92.\n\nRespondent\u2019s primary case is that the loss of value claim is unfounded because neither the existence nor the extent of any damage under this heading, caused by Respondent\u2019s breach of the DR-CAFTA, has been established by Claimant, who bears the burden of proof. As a subsidiary point, Respondent argues that Claimant\u2019s damages calculations are in any event incorrect.70\n\nSee Rejoinder, section IV.D.\n\n***iii. Tribunal\u2019s analysis***\n------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nIn order to determine the amount of the \u2018loss of value\u2019 damage caused to Claimant by the breach of the DR-CAFTA by Respondent, it is necessary to establish\n\na. The value of EEGSA at the point of its sale to EPM\n\nb. The \u2018But-for\u2019 value of EEGSA\n\nc. The causal link between any loss of value and the breach of the DR-CAFTA.\n\n94.\n\nWhat may loosely be called \"Claimant\u2019s sale of EEGSA\" was in fact a sale of the portfolio of companies held by DECA II, which was a holding company, by the DECA II shareholders, among which Claimant was a minority shareholder, following the offer made by EPM.71 The determination of the value of EEGSA itself at the point of the sale to EPM is therefore not a straightforward matter, because EEGSA was not clearly separated out from the other assets of DECA II.72 No contemporaneous valuations of EEGSA itself by TECO or by Iberdrola were presented in the Original Arbitration or in these proceedings.73\n\nSee Original Award, paras. 236-237, 746-748f; Memorial, para. 44; Tr. Day 1, 161.\n\nSee Tr. Day 3, 612; Award, para. 423. Claimant had earlier said that EEGSA accounted for 62.2% of the value of DECA II, and therefore had an implied value of US$ 498 million: see the Memorial in the Original proceeding, para. 305; Navigant Report I, paras. 240-241.\n\nTr. Day 1, 193.\n\n95.\n\nIn the present case, the actual price paid for DECA II is known: the sale of DECA II to EPM for US$ 605 million yielded US$ 181.5 million for TECO\u2019s (approximately) 30% equity stake in DECA II.74 What is not known is how much of that US$ 605 million price was attributable to the EEGSA shares held by DECA II, as opposed to the other shareholdings held by DECA II.75\n\nSee [REDACTED]\n\nThe shareholdings are set out in the Navigant Report III, p. 105, Table 23.\n\n96.\n\nClaimant\u2019s expert\u2019s estimates of the actual value of the EEGSA component of DECA II cover a range from US$ 498.0 million, using EBITDA information for the 2009 tax year *(i.e.,* January 1 - December 31, 2009),76 to US$ 602.9 million, using the \u2018comparable transactions\u2019 approach, and settle on a Weighted Average Enterprise Value for EEGSA of US$ 562.4 million.77 Respondent\u2019s expert, using slightly later data (such as the EBITDA for the 12 months prior to the sale of DECA II, from October 2009 to September 2010) estimates that the actual value of EEGSA was in fact US$ 518.2 million,78 or alternatively, using an analysis of the [REDACTED] a value of US$ [REDACTED] million.79\n\nNavigant Report III, paras. 28, 259 and 260.\n\nNavigant Report III, para. 256.\n\nAbdala-Delamer Expert Report. 2 February 2018, para. 204.\n\nAbdala-Delamer Expert Report. 2 February 2018, para. 205.\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that final conclusions of the expert evidence from each side do not differ radically. Claimant\u2019s best estimate of the actual value of EEGSA is US$ 562.4 million, and Respondent\u2019s best estimate is around US$ 580-582 million:80 the figures are within 4% of one another.\n\nTr. Day 3, 682.\n\n98.\n\nTaking note of the range of methodologies employed and the explanations in the Navigant Report, the Tribunal has decided to accept the figure identified by Mr Kaczmarek as the actual value of EEGSA at the time of the sale of DECA II: US$ 562.4 million. That implies a value of US$ 115.2 million for Claimant\u2019s (approximately) 30% share of 24.26% in the equity of EEGSA.81\n\n*I.e.,* Claimant's 30% share in DECA II multiplied by the 80.88% share of DECA II in EEGSA: Navigant Report III. para. 262. On the 80.88% share of DECA II in EEGSA, see para. 47, above.\n\n99.\n\nThe important question is whether Claimant has demonstrated that that figure would have been higher \u2018But for\u2019 Respondent\u2019s breach of its obligations under DR-CAFTA, and if so, by how much: that is, whether Claimant has demonstrated that the breach by Respondent of its obligations under the DR-CAFTA caused a loss of value of EEGSA when it was sold.\n\n100.\n\nThe Citigroup Fairness Report was premised on the assumption that \"[REDACTED]\" (*i.e., in what* would be the Fourth Tariff Period).82 Thus, Citigroup considered the DECA II sale price of US$605 million to be fair, [REDACTED] Citi group noted that \"[REDACTED]\"83\n\nCitigroup Fairness Report, pp. 14, 29 (footnote).\n\nCitigroup Fairness Report, p. 11.\n\n101.\n\nThe instructions that led to the Citigroup Fairness Report are not in evidence in this case. The fact that Citigroup assumed for the purposes of its Fairness calculations that [REDACTED] does not necessarily indicate that EPM made a similar assumption or that the sale price must have been materially affected by such an assumption.\n\n102.\n\nIt might be argued that it follows logically that if the sale price of DECA II was fair when based (as it was) on the assumption that [REDACTED] it is axiomatic that if the EEGSA VAD tariff had not been assumed to be [REDACTED] the 2010 value of DECA II would have been higher. Indeed, Respondent\u2019s expert Dr. Abdala appears to have accepted that in principle such an effect might be expected.84 But Respondent submitted that the higher tariffs based on the Bates White VNR and FRC would not have been considered to be sustainable and would not have been relied upon in 2010 in determining the value and sale price of DECA II; and furthermore, there would have been no reason to suppose that the dispute over the Bates White Report (and, therefore, a breach of the BIT) would recur.85\n\nTr. Day 3, 702-710.\n\nTr. Day 3, 700-705; cf., Tr. Day 1, 217-227.\n\n103.\n\nThere are two distinct elements to the question of the loss of value claim. The first relates to the period up to 31 July 2013, when the Third Tariff Period ended; and the second relates to the period from 1 August 2013 onwards.\n\n**a) The period 2010-2013**\n---------------------------\n\n104.\n\nAs to the first of those elements, the Tribunal considers that it is evident that the shortfall in the cash flow - that caused the Original Tribunal to award historical damages for the period from August 2008 until October 2010, when EEGSA was sold,86 would continue until the end of the Third Tariff Period on 31 July 2013. The fact that the losses of cash flow in the Third Tariff Period were divided in Claimant\u2019s claim into those falling before and those falling after 21 October 2010 is no more than a reflection of the conceptual distinction in the claim between \u2018historic\u2019 or 'lost cash flow\u2019 damages on the one hand and of 'loss of value\u2019 damages on the other.87 The loss of the cash flow resulting in the period from 21 October 2010 to the end of the Third Tariff Period on 31 July 2013 had the exactly same cause and the same character as the lost cash flow up to 21 October 2010 for which the Original Tribunal awarded damages.\n\nOriginal Award, paras. 716 and 742.\n\nNavigant Report III. paras. 144-146.\n\n105.\n\nHaving been awarded damages in respect of the period 2008-2010, in a portion of the Original Award that stands as *res judicata,* this Tribunal considers that Claimant is entitled to recover its share of that shortfall in cash flow until the end of the Tariff Period in 2013. That shortfall was already inevitable and its amount could be calculated at the time of the sale to EPM. Any rational buyer in 2010 would have taken the impending 2010-2013 cash flow shortfall into account and deducted that amount, discounted to its value at October 2010, from the sale price. There is no evidence to suggest that this natural consequence of the depressed tariff was disregarded in determining the sale price: on the contrary, [REDACTED] it was taken into account by TECO; and there is some evidence that EPM took it into account.88\n\nOriginal Award, para. 753.\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly decides that Claimant is entitled by way of damages to recover the cash flow shortfall between the 21 October 2010 sale date and the end of the 2008-2013 tariff round on 31 July 2013, discounted to its value at 21 October 2010.\n\n**b) The period 2013-2018**\n---------------------------\n\n107.\n\nAs for the cash flow during the years 2013-2018 following the Third Tariff Period, the position is different. In relation to this period the Tribunal has taken its decision by a majority.\n\n108.\n\nClaimant indicated that its claim was that the 2008-2013 tariff was in itself invalid and constituted a breach of the DR-CAFTA: in Claimant\u2019s view, the breach did not consist only in a violation of Claimant\u2019s procedural rights in relation to the process by which that tariff was set.89 The Tribunal, however, considers that the breach lay in the procedural deficiencies that led up to the adoption of the tariff, and not in the resulting tariff itself taken in isolation. This is important because it means that the impact of the breach of the BIT upon the sale price of EEGSA would have depended upon the expectation of a recurrence of the procedural \u2018problem\u2019 concerning the setting of the tariff and of the impact of such a recurrence.\n\nTr. Day 4, 874-885.\n\n109.\n\nThe procedural deficiencies in the determination of the tariffs for 2008-2013 were a single episode. While the Tribunal accepts that the episode may indeed evidence the aim of the Government of Guatemala in keeping electricity prices low, as suggested by Claimant,90 it does not consider that aim to be in any way remarkable or improper: it is presumably an aim of most or all reasonable Governments. The question is, therefore, whether the episode demonstrated that the Respondent\u2019s Government was likely in future to pursue that objective, unobjectionable in itself, in a manner that violated its obligations under DR-CAFTA. The Government could, after all, pursue that objective through procedures that would have been compliant with its obligations under the DR-CAFTA.\n\nTr. Day 4, 918.\n\n110.\n\nRecidivism is not to be presumed by investment tribunals. Nor may tribunals assume that the buyers of investments in a State presume that a Government whose actions have once been challenged as unlawful under domestic or international law will conduct itself in future without regard to its legal obligations.\n\n111.\n\nTo put the following paragraphs in context, it is helpful to summarize a divergence of views in the Tribunal. One of us considers that it is unrealistic to suppose that a buyer of EEGSA in 2010 would, when valuing the company, have disregarded the depression of its tariff income in the 2008-2013 tariff, and further, that taking that depression of income into account does not amount to a presumption of ongoing breaches of the DR-CAFTA: it is simply a matter of taking into account the information then available on EEGSA\u2019s actual income stream. In that sense, it is a direct consequence of the fact that the tariff was set at the level that it was in 2008. Because the setting of that tariff in 2008 breached the DR-CAFTA, the effect on the valuation of EEGSA is a direct consequence of that breach and is recoverable as damages. There is also a different, but closely related, argument: one might say that after the 2008 breach, the market would have considered there to be an increased risk that the regulator would act wrongly, and this increased risk would lower the value of EEGSA.\n\n112.\n\nThe majority of us takes a different view, and considers that any increased risk of wrongdoing would rationally have been the result of an appraisal of the conduct of the Respondent overall, including all State officers and agencies, and not of one regulatory agency considered in isolation. Furthermore, while the continuation through the next (2013-2018) Tariff Period of the depressed tariff was a possibility that would reasonably have been taken into account when valuing EEGSA in 2010, that possibility does not necessarily imply that the depressed tariff during that next Tariff Period would have been set in a manner that breached the Treaty.\n\n113.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal considers that if it had been assumed in 2010 that the depressed tariff for 2013-2018 would be set in a manner that did *not* breach the DR-CAFTA, that would indicate that there was no sound basis for assuming that \u2018But-for\u2019 estimates of tariffs for 2013-2018 could properly be based on the higher rates resulting from the Bates White calculations. This bears on the question of causation. On this view, the alleged 'loss of value\u2019 would not be caused by the initial breach in 2008 or, *ex hypothesi,* by any breach in 2013, and no 'loss of value\u2019 damages would be recoverable. If, on the other hand, it was assumed in 2010 that the depressed tariff would be set in 2013 in a manner that breached the DR-CAFTA, the loss of value would be caused by the 2013 breach, and damages would be recoverable for that breach. The second breach could not be said to have been \u2018caused\u2019 by the first (2008) breach; nor could the damages flowing from the second breach be said to be damages flowing from the first breach.\n\n114.\n\nThese points are elaborated in the paragraphs that follow.\n\n115.\n\nWhile Claimant asserts that a buyer in 2010 would have inferred from Respondent\u2019s conduct in the 2008-2013 tariff round a propensity to ignore the procedures prescribed by law for setting tariffs,91 Respondent points out that the EEGSA complaint in 2008 was a single, isolated instance and provided no basis for assuming that repetitions of the conduct of which complaint was made would occur.92 The Tribunal does not consider that Claimant has demonstrated, or that the evidence on the record in this case shows, that in 2010 it was thought likely that there would be a repetition of the procedural problems which arose over the setting of the 2008-2013 tariff.\n\nTr. Day 4, 887-888.\n\nTr. Day 4, 984, 988-992, 1030.\n\n116.\n\nMoreover, whether or not such a repetition of the procedural problems was thought likely, it would not necessarily have entailed the same depression of the level of tariffs. There is no direct causal link between the procedural breach and the tariff eventually set: the CNEE was bound only to take into account the Expert Commission\u2019s recommendations, not necessarily to follow them. Since the financial impact would be a consequence of the tariff, rather than of the procedure followed in setting it, the absence of this causal link is significant. The majority of the Tribunal does not consider that Claimant has bridged this gap in the chain of causation.\n\n117.\n\nClaimant argues that the continuing losses of EEGSA were in any event consequences, in addition to the historical loss of cash flow, that flowed directly from the initial breach, in relation to which the Original Tribunal\u2019s finding of liability has the force of *res judicata,* so that this Tribunal has only to calculate the quantum. The Tribunal does not accept that argument. The findings of the Original Tribunal on 'loss of value\u2019 damages were annulled. The historical damages claim and the 'loss of value\u2019 claim were treated by the Original Tribunal as distinct heads of damages.93 The present Tribunal is entitled and obliged to determine for itself what damages, if any, were caused by Respondent\u2019s breach of the DR-CAFTA to Claimant by way of a reduction in the value of EEGSA. This it has done; and it does not accept that it is established that the sale value of EEGSA was reduced by reason of an expectation that tariffs would be set for the period after the 2008-2013 tariff round in a manner that would constitute a violation of the DR-CAFTA.\n\nOriginal Award, para. 716.\n\n118.\n\nThere is a further point. Claimant\u2019s calculation of the \u2018But-for\u2019 value is based upon the projection after 2013 of the approach adopted in the Bates White VNR studies, and their calculation of the actual value was based upon projections from the approach adopted in the Sigla studies.94 Those approaches differed significantly in their treatment of the depreciation adjustment and the return on capital.95 But the majority of the Tribunal considers that, just as it was not established by Claimant that it would be presumed by a buyer at the time of the sale of EEGSA in 2010 that the CNEE would continue to set \u2018depressed\u2019 tariffs in and after 2013, and to do so in a manner that violated the DR-CAFTA, neither has Claimant established that it would have been assumed in 2010 that in the \u2018But-for\u2019 world where Respondent complied in every respect with its obligations under the DR-CAFTA, tariffs would necessarily be set in line with the approach adopted in the Bates White calculations and at the level estimated by Claimant.96\n\nNavigant Report III, paras. 189-195.\n\nNavigant Report III, para. 195, Table 6.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr Federico Restrepo, the CEO of EPM. which bought EEGSA, said in evidence: \"[o]ur valuation process of the company included various scenarios, one of them being that the VAD - value received by distributors for the service - would not be modified.\" The clear implication is that EPM also contemplated that the VAD might be modified. Asked whether the company would have cost more (*i.e.*, had a higher value) if the VAD had been different, Mr Restrepo apparently considered that the answer was uncertain. He said \"That is possible...\". See Original Award, para. 753, citing Exhibit R-133.\n\n119.\n\nIt is true that much of the material part of the Bates White calculations for the Third Tariff Period found approval in the Expert Commission and in the Original Tribunal, and that no reasons for departing materially from the Bates White approach were identified. But the present Tribunal does not find it to be established with sufficient certainty that the Bates White approach can simply be projected beyond 2013 in calculating the \u2018But-for\u2019 value of EEGSA in 2010.\n\n120.\n\nThe Original Tribunal said that it \"finds no sufficient evidence of the existence and quantum of the losses that were allegedly suffered as a consequence of the sale.\"97 This finding was criticised by the Annulment Committee on the ground that the Original Tribunal \"did not specify why it found the four expert reports submitted by the Parties, which amounted to about 1200 pages of analysis, and why the calculations put forward by the Parties, which were in dispute, were deemed unsatisfactory and amounted to \u2018no sufficient evidence\u2019.\"98\n\nOriginal Award, para. 749.\n\nDecision on Annulment, para. 130.\n\n121.\n\nThe present Tribunal views the matter slightly differently, but with the same result. The majority of the present Tribunal considers that the primary difficulty in the way of the claim for loss of value damages (apart from those damages resulting from the loss of cash flow in the period up to 31 July 2013) is not a difficulty of calculation, but rather one of establishing causation. Neither (a) the assumption that depressed rates would continue, which underlay both the Navigant calculation of the \u2018actual value\u2019 of EEGSA [REDACTED] nor (b) the assumption that what might be called \u2018CAFTA-compliant' tariffs would be based upon a projection of the 2008 Bates White approach, is warranted by the evidence in this case. As is well established, tribunals must reject claims that are too uncertain or speculative or otherwise unproven.99\n\nSee, e.g., *Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/04/5, Award. 21 November 2007, para. 285; *BG Group Plc. v. Argentine Republic,* UNCITRAL, Final Award. 24 December 2007. para 428; *Gemplus S.A., SLP, S.A., and Gemplus Industrial, S.A. de C.V. v*. *United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3, Award, 16 June 2010, para. 12.56.\n\n122.\n\nOne member of the Tribunal notes that in 2010, the buyer, EPM, was faced with the fact that the tariffs that EEGSA was allowed to charge had been fixed, in what was subsequently found to be a breach of the BIT, at levels below those which EEGSA considered were properly applicable. This member considers that EPM would have had no alternative but to base its estimate of the value of EEGSA on the assumption that such tariffs would continue in future. This member further believes that there is evidence in the record that EPM in fact considered the existing tariff as a relevant factor in determining the price of the transaction. As indicated in para. 753 of the Original Award, the CEO of EPM stated: *\"We bought on the basis that the current tariff model and layout is the one that exists. Clearly it has an impact on the final valuation and we had no expectation that it would be modified or changed.\"* When asked specifically about the expectations for the \"next five-year\" period, the CEO of EPM responded: *\"Our valuation process of the company included various scenarios one of them being that the VAD - value received by distributors for the service - would not be modified.\"* The Original Tribunal confirmed that conclusion when it found that: *\"Such statements show that the existing tariff were considered as a relevant factor in determining the price of the transaction.* \"100 On this view, it is not the anticipation of *future breaches* of the Treaty, but rather the undeniable fact that the tariffs operative at that time had been set at a lower level, that causes the reduction in the value of EEGSA: the lower valuation, based on the lower tariffs imposed in breach of the BIT, is thus a direct result of that breach of the BIT. The majority of members of the Tribunal, however, considers that this approach either builds upon an implicit presupposition of the continuation and repetition of a breach of the BIT or amounts to a decision to require compensation in circumstances where, after the Original Award identified and determined the breach of the BIT, the Respondent fixes tariffs in full compliance with its obligations under the BIT. The majority considers that no provision of the BIT requires compensation to be paid in such circumstances.\n\nOriginal Award, para. 754.\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly decides that Claimant is entitled by way of damages to recover the cash flow shortfall between the 21 October 2010 sale date and the end of the 2008-2013 tariff round on 31 July 2013, discounted to its value at 21 October 2010, but dismisses the claim for damages in respect of a loss of value of EEGSA allegedly realized upon its sale on 21 October 2010.\n\n***iv. Interest***\n------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Original Tribunal awarded TECO historical lost cash flow damages of US$ 21,100,552, plus interest from the date of the sale of TECO\u2019s interest in DECA II to EPM (21 October 2010) until payment, at the US Prime Rate plus 2%. The Original Tribunal denied the claim for interest on historical lost cash flows from 1 August 2009 until 21 October 2009 (the \u2018pre-sale interest\u2019) on the ground that\n\n\"because the US$ 21,100,552 historical losses damages correspond to revenues that would have progressively flowed into EEGSA from August 2008 until October 2010 and because such amount has not been discounted to August 2008, calculating interest on the entire amount of the historical damages as from the first day of the tariff period would result in an unjust enrichment of the Claimant. As a consequence, interest shall accrue only from October 21, 2010.\"101 (footnote omitted)\n\nOriginal Award, para. 765.\n\n125.\n\nThe Original Tribunal\u2019s decision on pre-sale interest was annulled on the ground that the Parties had not been given an opportunity to be heard on the \u2018unjust enrichment\u2019 point.102 TECO argued before the Annulment Committee that it \"had not requested interest running on the \u2018entire\u2019 amount of damages as from 1 August 2008, but rather had requested interest in tranches as from 1 August 2009\",103 but the Committee did not specifically uphold that argument.104\n\nDecision on Annulment, para. 195.\n\nDecision on Annulment, para. 194.\n\nDecision on Annulment, paras. 179-182.\n\n126.\n\nThis Tribunal considers that Claimant\u2019s right to be made whole in respect of losses sustained as a result of Respondent\u2019s breach of its obligations under DR-CAFTA105 necessarily implies that Claimant should be awarded interest on sums that should have been available to it, calculated from the dates when it should have received those sums. Respondent, too, accepts this principle.106 Indeed, the Parties\u2019 respective experts also agree upon the rate of interest payable up to the date of the sale of EEGSA, on 21 October 2010, being 8.8%,107 and on the sum payable in respect of the period up to the date of the sale, which is US$ 838,784.108\n\nCf., Tr. Day 4, 870.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 256; Rejoinder, para. 209.\n\nTr. Day 1, 28, Tr. Day 3, 634; Rejoinder, paras. 209-211.\n\nNavigant Report IV, Appendix 4.D; Abdala-Delamer Expert Report, 2 February 2018, Table 1.\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly makes an award in respect of the \u2018pre-sale interest\u2019 on the damages due to it up to the date of the sale, in the sum of US$ 838,784, as at 21 October 2010.\n\n128.\n\nThere is a remaining disagreement concerning the rate applicable after the date of the sale to calculate the interest due on the sums payable as pre-sale interest on the lost cash flows.109 Claimant suggests that this Tribunal cannot revisit the finding of the Original Tribunal that the interest rate that reflects the loss to Claimant is US Prime + 2%,110 which finding it says was affirmed by the *ad hoc* Committee in the annulment proceedings.111 Respondent argues that a risk-free rate should be applied to reflect the fact that TECO was not exposed to any commercial operating risk after the sale of its interest in DECA II/EEGSA112 and that the Original Tribunal explicitly sided with Respondent on this point,113 despite which the Original Tribunal erroneously proceeded to apply a rate of US Prime + 2%, which is a commercial rate.114\n\nTr. Day 1, 28-29.\n\nOriginal Award, para. 767.\n\nTr. Day 1, 30.\n\nTr. Day 4, 1065.\n\nSee Original Award, para. 766.\n\nTr. Day 3, 634.\n\n129.\n\nThe Original Tribunal explicitly distinguished between the questions of pre-sale and post-sale interest.115 The Annulment Committee explicitly annulled the Original Tribunal\u2019s \"decision on interest on historical damages for the period 1 August 2009 until 21 October 2010, as reflected in paragraphs D and G of the *dispositif* of the Award\", and specifically annulled also \"the corresponding paragraphs in the body of the Award related to damages (paragraphs 765, 768)\".116 The relevant section of the Original Award reads as follows:\n\n\"765. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that interest should only accrue from the date of the sale of EEGSA to EPM in October 2010. As a matter of fact, because the US$21,100,552 historical losses damages correspond to revenues that would have progressively flowed into EEGSA from August 2008 until October 2010, and because such amount has not been discounted to August 2008, calculating interest on the entire amount of the historical damages as from the first day of the tariff period would result in an unjust enrichment of the Claimant. As a consequence, interest shall only accrue from October 21, 2010.\n\n766. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that applying EEGSA's WACC post-October 2010 would not make sense since the Claimant had sold its interest in EEGSA and ceased to assume the company\u2019s operating risks. The Arbitral Tribunal thus agrees with the Respondent that a risk-free rate should be applied.\n\n767. Because the loss suffered by the Claimant corresponds to the cost of borrowing money in the United States, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Mr. Kaczmarek\u2019s evidence that the proper interest should be based on the US Prime rate of interest plus a 2 percent premium in order to reflect a rate that is broadly available to the market.\n\n768. As a consequence, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the damages granted to the Claimant will bear pre and post-aw ard interest at the US Prime rate of interest plus a 2 percent premium from October 21, 2010 until full payment. Such interest shall be compounded on an annual basis.\" (footnotes omitted)\n\nOriginal Award, para. 766.\n\nDecision on Annulment, para. 382(2).\n\n130.\n\nIn that section of the Original Award, only paragraphs 765 and 768 were subsequently annulled. The ground of annulment was the failure of the Original Tribunal to offer the Parties a proper opportunity to make submissions on the \u2018unjust enrichment\u2019 argument that paragraph 765 indicated was the basis of the Original Tribunal\u2019s decision. Paragraph 765 was the location of the defect in the Original Award, and paragraph 768 was the paragraph that set out the flawed conclusion that flowed from paragraph 765: consequently, both were annulled.117\n\nDecision on Annulment, paras. 183-198.\n\n131.\n\nAs was noted above, however, in the present proceedings attention was focused on paragraphs 766 and 767, which were not annulled. Claimant sought to rely on paragraph 767, and Respondent on paragraph 766. But there is an apparent inconsistency between paragraph 766, which indicates that a risk-free rate should be applied, and paragraph 767, which applies what is evidently not a risk-free rate. The position of the Original Tribunal on the manner in which interest is to be calculated is, accordingly, unclear. For that reason, a majority of this Tribunal does not consider that the Original Tribunal\u2019s decision on post-sale interest can have the status of *res judicata* in this context. For a determination to have the status of *res judicata,* it must at least be a clear determination of a question argued before the tribunal. One member of the present Tribunal considers that paragraph 767, deciding the applicable interest rate, was annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee. These divergent views reach the same conclusion in relation to the applicability of the \"US Prime rate of interest plus a 2 percent premium\" rate: that the present Tribunal is not bound to apply the interest rate set in paragraph 767 of the Original Award.\n\n132.\n\nOne member of the Tribunal points out that the reference to the \u2018US Prime rate of interest plus a 2 percent premium\u2019 and the reference to a \u2018risk-free rate\u2019 are separate matters. That member notes that paragraph 766 of the Original Award, referring to the application of a \u2018risk-free rate\u2019, was not annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee, and considers that the present Tribunal is accordingly bound to apply a risk-free rate as *res judicata.* The majority of the Tribunal considers that the inconsistency between paragraphs 766 and 767, referred to above, precludes those paragraphs taking effect in the present context as *res judicata.*\n\n133.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal considers that the focus in the award of damages is upon the reparation of injuries sustained, and that it is accordingly the rate that a claimant would have had to pay to repair the injury that is the point of reference in determining the interest rate. While it is true that Claimant\u2019s investment in EEGSA was no longer at risk after it had sold that investment for cash, if Claimant had borrowed in order to fill the gap in the sums owing to it as a consequence of Respondent\u2019s breach, it would have had to borrow at commercial rates.\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted above that the Parties are agreed on the interest rate applicable to the pre-sale lost cash flows, which was a rate of 8.8% derived from the EEGSA WACC. That yields a sum (principal + interest) of US$ 838,784 owing as of 21 October 2010 in respect of historic damages. To that must be added the discounted value as of 21 October 2010 of the cash flows that would be lost between that date and the end of the Third Tariff Period on 31 July 2013, which this Tribunal has found to constitute a loss in the value of EEGSA resulting from Respondent\u2019s breach of the DR-CAFTA. Together, those are the damages due on 21 October 2010 and owing as of that date.\n\n135.\n\nAs to the interest now payable on the damages owing as of 21 October 2010, the Tribunal again considers that the appropriate rate is one that the Claimant would have been expected to pay to repair the injury. Here, the majority of the Tribunal agrees with the Original Tribunal118 that the US Prime rate of interest plus 2%, payable both pre- and post-Award until the date of payment, is an appropriate rate.\n\nOriginal Award, para. 767.\n\n***v. Calculation of damages payable***\n---------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided that Respondent is liable to pay certain damages to Claimant. The operative paragraphs are as follows.\n\n137.\n\nIn paragraphs 106 and 123, it was decided that Claimant is entitled by way of damages to recover the cash flow shortfall between the 21 October 2010 sale date and the end of the 2008-2013 tariff round on 31 July 2013, discounted to its value as at 21 October 2010.\n\n138.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 respective experts have already assembled the data necessary to calculate these sums. The calculation by Claimant\u2019s expert, Navigant Consulting, Inc., of the amount of the cash flow shortfall for the period 01 August 2008 to 21 October 2010 resulting from the 2008 breach of the DR-CAFTA, adjusted to the valuation date of 21 October 2010 agreed by both Parties\u2019 experts,119 was accepted by the Original Tribunal in an unannulled portion of the Original Award.120 In doing so the Original Tribunal accepted Claimant\u2019s views on the issues in dispute that affected the calculation of that sum, and adopted Claimant\u2019s figure of US$21,100,552.121 The present Tribunal has found, in essence, that Claimant is also entitled to its share of the portion of the same cash flow shortfall that related to the period 22 October 2010 to 31 July 2013; i.e., the remainder of the Third Tariff Period. The same data and methodology as was accepted by the Original Tribunal is to be employed to calculate the amount of this further entitlement. The amount due was calculated to be US$26,793,001,122 calculated as at 21 October 2010, and the present Tribunal accordingly awards that sum to Claimant.\n\nNavigant Report IV, paras. 21, 43.\n\nOriginal Award, para. 742.\n\nIbid.\n\nNavigant Report IV, paras. 148-149. Cf., Tr. Day 1, 91, 4-7 and Day 4, 996: 11-21.\n\n139.\n\nIn paragraph 127, it was decided that Claimant is entitled by way of damages to recover \u2018pre-sale interest\u2019 on the damages due to it up to the date of the sale, in the sum of US$ 838,784, as at 21 October 2010.\n\n140.\n\nIn paragraph 135, it was decided that the US Prime rate of interest plus 2%, payable both pre- and post-Award until the date of payment, is an appropriate rate of interest applicable to the sums owing as of 21 October 2010.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n141.\n\nBoth Claimant and Respondent have been partially successful in this phase of the case. Their costs have, moreover, been incurred as a result of the pursuit of the annulment process that is a part of the ICSID and DR-CAFTA dispute settlement scheme to which they have both subscribed.\n\n142.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD): $527,518.84\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses |  |\n| Prof Vaughan Lowe, Q.C. | US $79,598.01 |\n| Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov | US $92,340.71 |\n| Prof. Brigitte Stem | US $106,107.32 |\n| ICSID\u2019s administrative fees | US $158,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses (estimated) | US $91,472.80 |\n| **Total** | **US $527,518.84** |\n\n143.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.123 As a result, each Party\u2019s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to US $263,759.42.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n144.\n\nIn addition, each Party has up to this point borne the whole of its own legal costs.\n\n**A. Claimant\u2019s Cost Submissions**\n----------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nClaimant\u2019s arguments were set out in detail in section V of its Memorial and section VI of its Reply Memorial. Claimant argues that Respondent should bear the total arbitration costs incurred by Claimant, saying that Respondent engaged in procedural misconduct in the initial proceedings,124 and that Claimant largely succeeded in its claims and that this success should be reflected in the costs order, citing the principle that costs follow the event.125 It says that its costs were reasonable, given the specific features of the case.\n\nSee e.g., Reply, paras. 238-245.\n\nReply, para. 226.\n\n146.\n\nIn its Memorial, Claimant submitted a claim for legal and other costs in the original proceedings, as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| White & Case Legal Fees & Expenses White & Case LLP Fees White & Case LLP Costs (not including TRANSLATION COSTS) White & Case LLP TRANSLATION Costs | Incurred Costs (US$) US$ 5,883,811.65 US$ 217,867.86 US$ 226,223.78 |\n| Total White & Case Fees & Expenses | US$ 6,327,903.29 |\n| Expert & Consultant Fees & Expenses | US$ 2,932,603.33 |\n| TECO Arbitration Expenses | US$ 17,087.24 |\n| ICSID COSTS | US$ 750,000.00 |\n| Total Incurred Costs | US$ 10,027,593.86 |\n\n147.\n\nClaimant has submitted the following claims for legal and other costs in the present (resubmitted) proceedings:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| WHITE & CASE LEGAL FEES & EXPENSES |  |\n| WHITE & CASE LLP FEES | US$ 2,699,055.65 |\n| WHITE & CASE LLP EXPENSES | US$ 105,454.94 |\n| TOTAL WHITE & CASE FEES & EXPENSES | US$ 2,804,510.59 |\n| EXPERT & CONSULTANT FEES & EXPENSES | US$ 857,324.73 |\n| TECO ARBITRATION EXPENSES | US$ 8,057.17 |\n| ICSID COSTS | US$ 410,000.00 |\n| TOTAL INCURRED COSTS | US$ 4,079,892.49 |\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Cost Submissions**\n------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nRespondent\u2019s submissions on costs are set out in detail in section VI of its Counter-Memorial and section VI of its Rejoinder. Respondent says that \"it is widely accepted in international arbitration that, in those cases where the result of an arbitration is not clear, costs must be awarded in consideration of the relative success of the claims of each of the parties\",126 and says that the Original Tribunal rejected more than 90% of the claim for damages submitted by Claimant.127 Respondent rejects claims that it engaged in misconduct in the initial proceedings. It submits that Claimant\u2019s costs were in any event excessively high. It asks the Tribunal to apply a 50% reduction to the amount of the costs claimed by Claimant and to order Respondent to pay no more than 10% of such costs.128\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 264.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 274.\n\nCounter-Memorial para. 282; Rejoinder, para. 239.\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent has submitted the following claims for legal and other:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Amounts paid** | **Amounts accrued and not yet paid** | **Total** |\n| **Tribunal and ICSID** |\n| Guatemala \u2019s share of costs | US$400,000 | N/A | US$400,000 |\n| **Guatemala\u2019s public officials** |\n| Travel costs and other disbursements | US$11,665.80 | N/A | US$11,665.8 |\n| **Valuation experts for Guatemala** |\n| Compass Lexecon | US$564,705.88 | US$235,294.12 | US$800,000 |\n| **Guatemala\u2019s legal representation** |\n| Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP | US$2,266,650 | US$1,304,100 | US$3,570,750 |\n| **Total costs claimed by Guatemala in the arbitration** | **US$4,782,415.80** |\n\n**C. Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Costs**\n-----------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n151.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n152.\n\nThe Original Tribunal awarded Claimant 75% of its costs, ordering Respondent to pay US$ 7,520,695.39.129 The Annulment Committee made detailed provision for the apportionment of costs and expenses arising in relation to the annulment proceedings.130\n\nOriginal Award para. 779.\n\nDecision on Annulment, para. 382.\n\n153.\n\nThe present Tribunal notes that the Parties are broadly agreed that costs awards should reflect the extent to which each party in an arbitration was successful. Quantifying \u2018success\u2019, whether measured in terms of the proportion of claimed damages that are awarded, or the proportion of claims or of arguments advanced that are upheld, or the proportion of costs attributable to successful claims or arguments, or in some other way, is of course a very inexact art. But in this case, it is evident that each side has had part of its case upheld and part of its case rejected. The Parties did, moreover, conduct the resubmitted proceedings in a cooperative manner, with professional efficiency.\n\n154.\n\nConsidering the submissions of the Parties on the question of costs, and exercising its discretion in accordance with Article 61 of the ICSID Convention, as acknowledged by both Parties, the Tribunal decides:\n\ni. That Respondent shall bear its own costs and reimburse 75% of Claimant\u2019s costs, including its contribution to the costs and expenses incurred by ICSID, arising in the proceedings before the Original Tribunal;\n\nii. That each Party shall pay the costs and expenses relating to the Annulment proceedings as determined in paragraph 382 of the Annulment Decision;\n\niii. That each Party shall bear its own costs and one half of the costs and expenses incurred by ICSID in the proceedings before this Tribunal.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n155.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal, by a majority, decides as follows:\n\nA. Claimant is entitled by way of damages to recover the cash flow shortfall between the 21 October 2010 sale date and the end of the 2008-2013 Tariff Period on 31 July 2013, i.e., the sum of US$ 26,793,001, calculated as at 21 October 2010;\n\nB. Claimant is entitled by way of damages to recover \u2018pre-sale interest\u2019 up to the date of the sale on 21 October 2010, in the sum of US$ 838,784, calculated as at 21 October 2010;\n\nC. The US Prime rate of interest plus 2%, payable both pre- and post-Award until the date of payment, is the rate of interest applicable to the sums owing as of 21 October 2010;\n\nD. All other claims are dismissed;\n\nE. On the matter of costs,\n\ni. Respondent shall bear its own costs and reimburse 75% of Claimant\u2019s costs, including its contribution to the costs and expenses incurred by ICSID, arising in the proceedings before the Original Tribunal;\n\nii.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 9 June 2020, Claimant filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") a Request of the same date for a Supplementary Decision in respect of the Award rendered on 13 May 2020 in the resubmission proceeding of *TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23) (the \"**Resubmission Award**\") (the \"**Request**\") by the Tribunal comprising Prof. Vaughan Lowe, Q.C. (British), President, appointed by the Secretary-General pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.19.3 and Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention; Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov (Bulgarian), appointed by Claimant; and Prof. Brigitte Stern (French), appointed by Respondent.\n\n5.\n\nOn 11 June 2020, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Rule 49(1)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and transmitted the same to the Members of the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n6.\n\nOn 15 June 2020, the Tribunal fixed a timetable for the Parties' submissions on the Request.\n\n7.\n\nOn 29 June 2020, Respondent submitted observations on the Request.\n\n8.\n\nOn 2 July 2020, Claimant advised that it did not intend to avail itself of the opportunity to file a response to Respondent\u2019s observations of 29 June 2020.\n\n**III. PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n---------------------------\n\n**(1) Claimant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n9.\n\nIn accordance with Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Claimant requests the Tribunal to supplement the Resubmission Award \"by awarding Claimant interest on 75 percent of Claimant\u2019s costs incurred in the Original Arbitration (equal to US$ 7,520,695.39) running from 19 December 2013, i.e., the date of the Original Award.\"1\n\nRequest, \u00b69.\n\n10.\n\nClaimant submits that the Tribunal omitted to decide in the Resubmission Award the question concerning the interest to be awarded to Claimant upon the costs it incurred in the original arbitration (the \"**Original Arbitration**\"), running from the date of the original award rendered on 19 December 2013 (the \"**Original Award**).2\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 1-4.\n\n11.\n\nClaimant relies on *Pac Rim3* as support for the Request on the basis that the tribunal in that case acknowledged that it had \"inadvertently overlooked\" a claim for post-award interest, and summarily awarded that interest by way of a supplementary decision.4\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman, LLC v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent's Request for a Supplementary Decision, 28 Mar. 2017 \u00b6\u00b61.15-1.16.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 3.\n\n12.\n\nClaimant points out that it expressly requested the Tribunal to award such interest both in its resubmission Memorial and in its resubmission Reply.5\n\nRequest, \u00b6 4, referring to Resubmission Memorial, \u00b6 268 and Resubmission Reply, \u00b6 246.\n\n13.\n\nClaimant recalls that the Tribunal decided in the Resubmission Award that \"Respondent shall bear its own costs and *reimburse 75% of Claimant's costs,* including its contribution to the costs and expenses incurred by ICSID, arising in the proceedings before the Original Tribunal.\"6\n\nRequest, \u00b6 5, quoting Resubmission Award, \u00b6 155 (emphasis added).\n\n14.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the omission is material as it would imply that instead of receiving the 75 % of its costs that Claimant was awarded (i.e., US$ 7,520,695.39), it would in fact only receive 50 %.7\n\nRequest, \u00b6 7.\n\n15.\n\nClaimant contends that in line with the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in the Award, the applicable interest rate here should also be of US Prime plus 2 %,8 which, when applied to the above-indicated 75 % of Claimant\u2019s incurred costs, would amount to US$ 3,454,058.70 in interest as of 31 May 2020.9\n\nRequest, \u00b6 8. *See* Resubmission Award, \u00b6 135.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 6.\n\n**(2) Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n16.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant\u2019s request is unfounded, an attempt in bad faith and greed by Claimant to obtain a higher compensation than awarded, and should be dismissed in its entirety.10\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b62.\n\n17.\n\nRespondent explains that Claimant \"did not address, did not justify and did not specifically request in the submission section of its memorials, as well as during the hearing its alleged claim for interest on the costs of the Original Arbitration\", and that, therefore, the Tribunal did not have to decide on a claim that did not exist. In support, Respondent cites the *Genin*11 tribunal\u2019s holding where in similar circumstances it rejected the supplementary request.12\n\n*Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v The Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Decision on Claimants' Request for supplementary Decisions and Rectification, 10 April 2002.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.\n\n18.\n\nNonetheless, should the Tribunal find that Claimant did submit the claim, the Respondent asserts that the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, did not have to address, specifically and in detail in the Resubmission Award, a claim that was barely outlined during the arbitration.13\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.\n\n19.\n\nAccording to Respondent, because the Tribunal held in the Resubmission Award that Guatemala shall pay 75% of the costs incurred by the Claimant in the Original Arbitration, and nothing more, the Tribunal \"rejected, explicitly and implicitly, the claim that motivates the Request.\"14\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.\n\n20.\n\nRespondent, recalling Prof. Schreuer\u2019s interpretation that the supplementary decision under Art. 49(2) of the ICSID Convention \"is not designed to afford a substantive review or reconsideration of the decision\",15 and along the same lines also relying on *LG&E*,16 argues that Claimant\u2019s Request is \"unacceptable and exceeds the scope of a supplementary decision, as the claim on the Request has been decided and rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal.\"17\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, (2009), page 849, \u00b6 28.\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., et al v.

ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n23.\n\nArticle 49(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award....\"\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that Claimant had requested in its resubmission Memorial that the Tribunal \"order Respondent to bear all of Claimant's costs incurred in the Original Arbitration, or, at a minimum, 75 percent of Claimant's costs incurred in the Original Arbitration, as set forth in the chart below, plus interest from the date of the Award in the Original Arbitration.\"20\n\nResubmission Memorial, \u00b6 268 (emphasis omitted).\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal further considers that Claimant's current application clearly falls within the scope of ICSID Article 49(2), and that the Tribunal has the power and the duty to respond to that application.\n\n26.\n\nIt was noted in the Resubmission Award that the \"the Parties are broadly agreed that costs awards should reflect the extent to which each party in an arbitration was successful.\"21 It was on that basis that the Tribunal decided in the Resubmission Award as follows:\n\n\"155.E. On the matter of costs:\n\ni. Respondent shall bear its own costs and reimburse 75% of Claimant's costs, including its contribution to the costs and expenses incurred by ICSID, arising in the proceedings before the Original Tribunal;\n\nii. Each Party shall pay the costs and expenses relating to the Annulment proceedings as determined in paragraph 382 of the Annulment Decision;\n\niii. Each Party shall bear its own costs and one half of the costs and expenses incurred by ICSID in the proceedings before this Tribunal.\"22\n\nResubmission Award, \u00b6 153.\n\nResubmission Award, \u00b6 155.E.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal also decided in the Resubmission Award that \"[t]he US Prime rate of interest plus 2%, payable both pre- and post-Award until the date of payment, is the rate of interest applicable to the sums owing as of 21 October 2010.\"23\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 155.C.\n\n28.\n\nUnder the rules applicable to this arbitration, it is for the Tribunal to \"decide how and by whom those expenses [incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings], the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre [i.e., ICSID] shall be paid.\"24 Thus, as the Tribunal noted in paragraph 151 of the Resubmission Award, the ICSID Convention \"gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\" The obvious corollary is that a claim for costs is not necessarily subject to the same principles as govern reparation for losses sustained as a result of an unlawful act, although a tribunal may decide in the exercise of its discretion to apply the same principles in both circumstances.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 61(2).\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that entitlements to sums awarded to a party by way of costs in an arbitral award can generally be said to be owing prior to the date of the award. In the present case, however, the Tribunal distinguished between the costs arising in (i) the proceedings before the Original Tribunal, (ii) the Annulment proceedings, and (iii) the Resubmission proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nThe decision of the Original Tribunal, set out in its Award dated 19 December 2013, in relation to the costs arising in the original proceedings, was annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee in light of its partial annulment of the Original Award. The present Tribunal\u2019s decision in paragraph 155.E of the Resubmission Award is thus a retrospective determination of the amount of the costs awarded in the proceedings that ended with the Original Award of 19 December 2013.\n\n31.\n\nHaving considered the submissions of the Parties, the present Tribunal accordingly decides that the 75% of Claimant's costs, including its contribution to the costs and expenses incurred by ICSID, arising in the proceedings before the Original Tribunal, which Respondent was directed by paragraph 155.E of the Resubmission Award to pay to Claimant, is to be treated as if it were a sum owing as of 19 December 2013.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal further decides that in order to avoid Respondent obtaining a significant benefit from the delay in payment, interest is payable on that sum running from 19 December 2013. The Tribunal, by a majority, considers that the costs of the ICSID procedures may be regarded as being something to which both sides contribute as a payment for the availability of a facility which ultimately benefits them both, rather than an additional element in the damages sustained by a successful claimant; and it considers further that the balance between the Parties will be restored if the interest reflects what Respondent would have been able to earn from the savings corresponding to the delayed payment due in respect of costs, rather than the cost to Claimant of borrowing that sum. Accordingly, it decides, by a majority, that the interest payable pursuant to the preceding paragraph is payable at a non-commercial rate: the US prime rate.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n33.\n\nRespondent requested that Claimant be ordered to reimburse Respondent's costs incurred in its defense in connection with this supplementary decision proceeding.25 Claimant did not formally request an order in respect of these costs.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 23(iii).\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that neither Party should have to bear the whole cost of this Supplementary Decision, and that both Parties have the benefit of the system of checks and procedures provided by ICSID. Accordingly, it decides that each Party shall bear its own costs and one half of the costs and expenses incurred by ICSID in these supplementary proceedings before this Tribunal.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n35.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(i) Claimant\u2019s Request for a Supplementary Decision is hereby granted.\n\n(ii) Respondent shall pay Claimant the sum of US$ 7,520,695.39 in respect of its costs incurred in the Original Arbitration, plus interest compounded annually at the US Prime rate, running from 19 December 2013.\n\n(iii) The fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the administrative expenses of ICSID incurred in connection with Claimant\u2019s Request for a Supplementary Decision shall be borne by in equal shares by the two Parties.\n\n(iv) Each Party shall bear its own legal and other expenses incurred in connection with Claimant\u2019s Request for a Supplementary Decision."}, {"Title": "Decision on Stay of Enforcement", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2021-05-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Stay of Enforcement\n-------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, the Republic of Guatemala filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes [\"**ICSID**\"] an Application for Annulment of the Award rendered on May 13, 2020 [the \"**Resubmission Award**\"] and supplemented by the **Supplementary Decision** dated October 16, 2020, in the resubmission proceeding in *TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23), [the \"**Annulment Application**\"]. In its Annulment Application the Republic of Guatemala requested the stay of enforcement of the Resubmission Award and the Supplementary Decision pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention. The Annulment Application was filed pursuant to Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States [the \"**ICSID Convention**\"] and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings [\"**Arbitration Rules**\"].\n\n2.\n\nOn February 22, 2021, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Annulment Application and notified the Parties that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n3.\n\nOn March 31, 2021, the Secretary-General notified the Parties of the constitution of the *ad hoc* Committee [the \"**Committee**\"] in accordance with Article 52(3) of the Convention. Its members are: Ms. Deva Villan\u00faa, a national of Spain, as President, Prof. Doug Jones, a dual national of Australia and Ireland, and Prof. Lawrence Boo, a national of Singapore. All members were appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID's Administrative Council. Ms. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, Legal Counsel, was appointed to serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n4.\n\nOn April 3, 2021, the Secretary of the Committee wrote to the Parties on instructions of the *ad hoc* Committee regarding the arrangements for the First Session and the request for stay of enforcement of the Resubmission Award and the Supplementary Decision.\n\n5.\n\nOn April 10, 2021, the Committee, through the ICSID Secretariat, circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 to the Parties and invited the Parties to submit a joint proposal advising the *ad hoc* Committee of the Parties' agreements on procedural matters. The Committee made reference to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) and paragraph 92 of the Annulment Application in which the Republic of Guatemala requested that the stay of enforcement of the Resubmission Award and the Supplementary Decision be maintained until the Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application has been issued. In such regard, the Committee invited the Parties to confer and jointly propose by April 14, 2021 a schedule of written submissions so as to efficiently address the Guatemala's request for the continuation of the stay; to consider whether an extension of the Rule 54(2) 30-day deadline was necessary and would be agreed between the Parties; and to agree on the language of their written submissions on the stay.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn April 14, 2021, the Republic of Guatemala informed the Committee, *inter alia*, that:\n\n\"the Parties had conferred and agreed to the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Resubmission Award until the Committee has rendered a decision on the Republic's Annulment Request. Thus, we respectfully request the Committee to confirm the Parties' agreement and order the continuation of the stay of the enforcement of the Resubmission Award until after the final decision in these annulment proceedings is rendered, dispensing the parties with written submissions on the matter\".\n\n7.\n\nOn April 15, 2021, TECO informed the Committee, among other things, that it did not oppose Guatemala's request that the stay of enforcement of the Resubmission Award be maintained until the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee is rendered.\n\n8.\n\nOn April 16, 2021, the Republic of Guatemala after referring to TECO's communication of April 15, 2021, requested that the Committee issue the corresponding decision, ordering the \"continuation of the stay of the enforcement of the award\" during the Annulment Proceedings and until the final decision on the annulment of the Resubmission Award is rendered.\n\n9.\n\nOn May 6, 2021, the Committee asked the Parties to confirm whether they required the Committee to issue a Decision recording the Parties' agreement on the stay of enforcement.\n\n10.\n\nOn the same date, and in response to the Committee's letter of May 6, 2021, the Republic of Guatemala requested \"the issuance of an order confirming the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award of Resubmission dated May 13, 2020 and the Supplemental Decision dated October 16, 2020. The Committee will note from the Parties' comments on the draft Procedural Order No. 1 submitted to the Committee on April 27, 2021 that TECO has no objection to the Republic making this request\".\n\n**III. THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe applicable rules to the stay of enforcement of an award are Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n12.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n\"The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request\".\n\n13.\n\nArbitration Rule 54(1) provides that:\n\n\"The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request\".\n\n14.\n\nAdditionally, the Committee takes note that Article 10(26)(6) of the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement [\"**DR-CAFTA**\" or the \"**Treaty**\"], in force for the United States since March 1, 2006, and for Guatemala since July 1, 2006, under which the Resubmission Award and Supplementary Decision were rendered, states that:\n\n\"A disputing party may not seek enforcement of a final award until:\n\n(a) in case of a final award made under the ICSID Convention\n\n(i) 120 days have elapsed from the date the award was rendered and no disputing party has requested revision or annulment of the award; or\n\n(ii) revision or annulment proceedings have been completed [\u2026]\".\n\n15.\n\nThe Committee takes note of (i) the above provisions, which foresee the non-enforceability of an award while an annulment proceeding is pending; and (ii) Claimant's lack of opposition to Respondent's request for stay of enforcement of the Resubmission Award and the Supplementary Decision until the Committee has rendered a decision on the Republic's Annulment Request.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n16.\n\nIn light of the above, and pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rule 54 and Article 10(26)(6) DR-CAFTA, the Committee confirms the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Resubmission Award rendered on May 13, 2020 and supplemented by the Supplementary Decision dated October 16, 2020, in the resubmission proceeding in *TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23), until the Committee has rendered its Decision on Annulment."}]}
