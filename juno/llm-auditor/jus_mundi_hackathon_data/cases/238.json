Prior to the hearing, the Tribunal enquired whether [REDACTED] would be available to attend by video link.4 The Claimant indicated by e-mail on 10 July that [REDACTED] would not be able to give evidence \"by video link or otherwise\" due to her ill health.5\n\nE-mail from Tribunal Secretary, 8 July 2016.\n\nE-mail from Claimant, 10 July 2016.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter sent on 8 July 2016. former Minister Kalousek informed the Tribunal that he would be unable to attend the Hearing because the Czech Parliament was sitting during the same week and he was required to attend as the leader of one of the two major opposition parties.

Transcript, Day 2, pp, 3-4; Transcript, Day 3, p. 1.\n\n28.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Tribunal also ruled not to admit the new documents referenced in the Claimant\u2019s letter of 5 July 2016.9\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 33.\n\n29.\n\nOn 30 September 2016, each Party filed its submissions on costs **(\"Claimant\u2019s Costs Submission\"** and **\"Respondent\u2019s Costs Submission\").** On 14 October 2016, the Respondent filed its Reply Submission on Costs.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated 18 January 2017, the Tribunal invited each of the Parties to make a final supplementary deposit on costs, with the final amounts for fees and expenses of the Tribunal to be limited to the balance of the final deposit.\n\n31.\n\nOn 7 February 2017, the Respondent submitted a Supplemented and Updated Summary of Costs and Expenses Incurred by the Czech Republic (the \"Supplemented Summary of Costs\") in which it claimed additional expenses resulting *\"mainly from invoices which Respondent received and processed after 30 September 2016 for work performed prior to that date by Mazars LLP, Weil Gotshal & Manges and Dechert LLP.\"* By letter dated 9 February 2017, the Claimant objected to the additional expenses claimed in the Supplemented Summary of Costs. On 11 February 2017, the Tribunal declined to allow the Respondent\u2019s claim.\n\n32.\n\nBy agreement of the Parties\u2019 positions the issues of the Respondent\u2019s Objections to Admissibility and Jurisdiction, as pleaded and summarized in Part V, were not bifurcated for preliminary determination. Nonetheless, the Tribunal will consider these as matters pleaded in defence at paragraphs 293 to 364 below, and then engage the continuing live merits issue in Part VI.B., at paragraphs 365 to 403.\n\n33.\n\nIt follows that it suffices for the factual background to be briefly summarized In short following Part III, with relevant detail being picked up under the following Parts of the Award. As will become apparent in these reasons, in the result many of the factual issues raised and on which the Parties joined issue do not fall for determination as they are not material to the sole continuing live merits issue of expropriation. In the same way, given the dispositive Award dismissing the entire claim, as set out on page 135 below, the entire issues of Damages and Quantum, summarized in Part V.D below, also cease to be relevant for determination.\n\n**III.

THE PARTIES\u2019 ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case is that the actions and inactions attributable to the Czech Republic in relation to Skoda Export during the privatization tender and after its acquisition by the Claimant, caused significant loss to the business of Skoda Export, which obliged the Claimant to withdraw from the SPA, and thereby deprived the Claimant of the entire benefit of its investment in the Czech Republic.\n\n62.\n\nThe impleaded actions and inactions of the Czech Republic are claimed to constitute separate breaches of its obligations under the BIT:\n\n(1) To observe the provisions of the \"specific agreements\" concluded by the Czech Republic with respect to the Claimant\u2019s investment (the **\"Umbrella Clause\")** (Article 2(3));\n\n(2) To accord \"fair and equitable treatment\" and to refrain from \"unreasonable or discriminatory measures\" **(\"FET\")** (Article 2(2)); and\n\n(3) Not to expropriate the Claimant\u2019s investment or subject its investment to measures having effect equivalent to expropriation, except \"for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation\" (Article 5).57\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6171-; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6335-384.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s answering position is that:\n\n(1) The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over any of the Claimant\u2019s claims or alternatively, has no jurisdiction over any of the Claimant\u2019s claims save for the expropriation claim under Article 5 of the BIT (the **\"Jurisdiction and Admissibility Objections\");**\n\n(2) The information provided to the Claimant during the privatization process was accurate and sufficient, and the Claimant failed to carry out due diligence properly;\n\n(3) The economic loss caused to Skoda Export after acquisition by the Claimant resulted from the Claimant\u2019s mismanagement of the company;\n\n(4) The terms on which the Claimant sought operational financing from the financing institutions were unreasonable;\n\n(5) The financing institutions operated on commercial terms and did not exercise governmental authority such as to engage the responsibility of the Czech Republic;\n\n(6) In any event, the Czech Republic took appropriate steps in response to the financial situation of Skoda Export; and\n\n(7) Accordingly, the Czech Republic has complied with all of its obligations under the BIT.\n\n**A.** The Respondent\u2019s Objections\n----------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear any of WNC\u2019s BIT claims on the grounds that:\n\n(1) The arbitration clause of the BIT has been superseded by European Union **(\"EU\")** law; and\n\n(2) Alternatively, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the terms of the BIT save for the expropriation claim under Article 5 of the BIT.\n\n**1.

It says that the decisions of the Czech courts \"do not address the legal arguments presented before this Tribunal, including the Respondent\u2019s breaches of its warranties and obligations under the SPA, or violations of Czech law in conducting the Tender\".109 The Claimant submits that the courts merely concluded that the SPA could not be invalidated on the basis that FITE had entered the agreement as a result of an error induced by the Respondent.110\n\nReply, \u00b6 333.\n\nReply, \u00b6 334.\n\n**(5) Relationship of Article 8(1) limitations with Article 2(3)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) The Respondent\u2019s position\n-----------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the BIT provisions listed in Article 8(1) are exhaustive: if Article 2(3) is activated by the existence of a \"specific agreement\", the words *'\"as well as the provisions of this Agreement\"* at the end of Article 2(3) cannot have the effect of extending the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to all substantive obligations in the BIT.111 It would be nonsensical, and would violate the principle of *effet utile* to interpret Article 2(3) to permit the arbitration of all claims under ail of the provisions of the BIT when the dispute resolution clause in Article 8(1) expressly limits each Contracting Party\u2019s consent to specifically enumerated provisions.112\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 473-480.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 475.\n\n95.\n\nThe meaning of Article 2(3) is that in the ordinary forum for disputes relating to \"specific agreements\" - which would either be the national courts designated by agreement or the applicable private international law rules - \"all applicable laws, including the BIT, will be taken into account\".113 The ***travaux*** to the BIT explicitly confirm this interpretation,114 as does the arbitral jurisprudence.115\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 477.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 477, referring to **R-185,** \u00b6 III.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 478-479, citing *Renta 4 S.

FACTUAL ISSUES**\n---------------------\n\n**1. The pre-acquisition information process**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**(1)The Claimant\u2019s position**\n------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Czech Republic provided misleading and inaccurate information about Skoda Export122 by means of the following:\n\n**(1) The Information Memorandum dated 25 September 2007,** prepared by Ernst & Young, which provided reasons for a prospective purchaser to acquire Skoda Export. The Information Memorandum stated that Skoda Export had 23 projects as of 30 June 2007 including three projects (the **\"Key Projects\")** which were \"of considerably greater scale and importance in terms of the company\u2019s role and projected profits\".123 These were: **(i)** construction of the Balloki Power Plant, Pakistan, contract value CZK 3.42 billion; (ii) construction of the Muridke Power Plant, Pakistan, contract value CZK 2.74 billion; and (iii) construction of the Bhikki Power Plant, contract value CZK 3.11 billion.124\n\n(2) **The Data Room;** The Data Room contained redacted copies of the original agreements under which the Key Projects were being carried out and contained expert valuations which placed the company\u2019s full share value at approximately CZK 375 million and CZK 417 million respectively.125 Further information was added to the data room in response to detailed questions from the FITE due diligence team,126 which included a series of short summary documents setting out \"basic information on the contracting parties, the contract values, the place of the projects, and the company\u2019s expected profits\" (the **\"Project Cards\").127** The Project Cards \"presented Skoda Export as a well-managed company with a portfolio of projects with total projected profits of approximately CZK 400 million\".128\n\n(3) **Managerial presentations: The** information in the Project Cards was \"confirmed\" by Skoda Export\u2019s management in the management presentations on 29 October and 6 November 2007.129 During the presentation on 6 November 2007, Skoda Export\u2019s management made statements concerning the expected profits of the company and of the Key Projects, which failed to disclose \"substantial problems\" already known to Skoda Export at the time, including in particular that the Bhikki Project would be abandoned130 and that the Balloki and Muridke Projects were \"slated to produce substantial deficits\".131\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 52-82, \u00b688-100; Reply, \u00b6 15-88; Transcript, Day 1 at 42-43, 48-68 (Claimant\u2019s Opening Statement, Dr Sinclair) 75-78 (Claimant\u2019s Opening Statement, Mr Triantafilou); Transcript, Day 3 at pp. 142-182 (Cross-examination of Mr Uvira); Transcript, Day 4 at pp. 27-36, 42-47 (Cross-examination of Mr Uvira).\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 57.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 57, referring to Information Memorandum, C-28, pp. 25-26.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b660, referring to Data Room Index, C-83; Expert Report of Ernst & Young No. 1/14345632/06, and accompanying documents, February 2006, C-88, p.4; Expert Report on the Assessment of Equitability of Compensation for Shareholders of SKODAEXPORT, A.S., 31 May 2005, C-87, p, 8,\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 61, referring to First Witness Statement of (CWS-6), \u00b6 17.\n\nProject Cards of Skoda Export a.s., C-86\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 62.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 63.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 64,\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 65-66.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it conducted a thorough due diligence on Skoda Export.132\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 61.71; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 19-25.\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent failed to ensure that Skoda Export was properly managed during the due diligence process. The MoF failed to take steps in response to issues with the situation of the company and the conduct of [REDACTED] reported by [REDACTED], to Mr Tom\u00e1s Uvira, Director of the Asset Administration Department of the MoF, in October 2007.133 instead of taking action to remove [REDACTED] from his position as [REDACTED] the MoF referred [REDACTED], concerns to the Board of Directors, which could not have taken the necessary remedial action, and allowed [REDACTED] and his deputy, [REDACTED] to take actions which harmed Skoda Export irreparably.134 Skoda Export\u2019s Insolvency Administrator on 8 December 2009 claimed the sum of CZK 674 million for misconduct in relation to the Key Projects.135\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b672-79.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 72-79.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 80.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s position**\n---------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nSufficient information was provided during the due diligence process.136\n\n(1) The **Information Memorandum:** The Respondent asserts that the Information Memorandum provided a balanced high-level overview of the business of Skoda Export and described risks which were overlooked by the Claimant, including (i) that the company operated in a specific market segment \"characterized by unevenness overtime and by long delivery times\", meaning that \"in individual years the financial results of the Company [could] be volatile and the profitability is influenced by contracts made in previous years\";137 (ii) that the prevailing market conditions at the lime of tender represented an independent risk;138 (iii) that as an EPC contractor the company was dependent on the suppliers of key components of the projects in which it was engaged by its subcontractors, in particular Siemens Engineering and General Electric;139 (iv) that the Company\u2019s dependence on outsourcing the technical design work on all of its projects to external providers was a specific risk potentially leading to \"existential endangering of the Company\".140 The Information Memorandum further alerted bidders to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the business results of the company and presented financial data showing exchange rate losses ranging from hundreds of millions to tens of millions of CZK.141\n\n(2) **The Data Room:** The Respondent emphasizes that the Data Room was open for at least 9 hours on each business day from 16 October 2007 to 12 November 2007 and from 26 to 29 November 2007.142 Referring to the complete Data Room index,143 the Respondent contends that the documents presented in the Data Room included a full set of contractual documentation entered into by the company in respect to each project,144 subject to the redaction of commercially sensitive information and the consent of the counterparty to the relevant agreement.145 In respect of the Balloki and Muridke projects, the contractual documents available in the Data Room showed that the prices contracted with customers \"were lump sum fixed prices denominated in USD which could not be increased either as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations during the life of the projects, or based on future increases in the costs of inputs in the realization phase of the projects\".146 Accordingly, it was \"fully disclosed to bidders\" that the economic performance of those projects \"was fully dependent on Skoda Export\u2019s ability to enter into back-to-back price-fixed contracts... at or below the agreed ETC purchase price and to appropriately hedge any open foreign exchange exposure\".147\n\n(3) **Managerial presentations:** The Respondent notes that the summary information provided in the Project Cards \"contained only a small fraction\" of the information provided about the projects.148 With respect to the Balloki project, the response to a question asked by the bidder Skoda Holding during its management presentation \"revealed that there were serious cost overruns in the assembly and construction part of that project and that these additional costs would burden the company, because they could not be passed on to the customer through a price increase\".149 Accordingly, a potential investor could conclude that the minimum cost overrun on the on-shore part could be estimated at USD 11,482,438.150 The management of Skoda Export disclosed that finishing the Balloki and Muridke projects on their original schedule was a problem.151 The company\u2019s strict financial liability under its EPC contracts was not matched by the liability of the subcontractor, Energoprojekt.152 Concerning other projects, the management presentations identified a number of small projects, including the Haripur project and the project in Uganda, which despite being originally planned as profitable were not expected to generate any profit.153\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 55-132, \u00b6\u00b6168-174;

Concerning the Bhikki project, the written replies to bidders indicated that progress of this project into the realization phase was \"extremely unlikely\"; there was no final calculation for the project and Skoda Export had not entered into any subcontracts.157 The contract was only legally terminated on 24 March 2008, after the signature of the SPA.158 The fact that the NIPCCO project had been terminated by the potential customer was made clear in the Project Card which indicated that the Termination Notice had been served on September 27, 2007,159 and it was thus clear that the fate of the project was highly uncertain.160 Concerning the Rio Turbio project, the Project Card revealed that Skoda Export had been outbid by another bidder, ISOLUX ESUCO, and that Skoda Export was unlikely to win this project.161\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 114-118.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 120.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 126.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 129.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 132; Rio Turbio U Project Evidential Card (24 October 2007), FTI-087.\n\n**2.

On 3 April 2009, after meetings of its Board of Directors and Supervisory Board, CEB informed Skoda Export of its internal decisions and the financing that it was prepared to malee available.257 The Respondent denies the Claimant\u2019s allegation that such terms were onerous or unjustified.258 According to the Respondent, CEB already had significant exposure to Skoda Export, whilst CKD had refused to provide any financial assistance to Skoda Export unless the requested financial aid was provided by the Czech Republic.259\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 258.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 261.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 262.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 267.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 270.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6271-275.\n\n147.\n\nThe position taken by CEB, namely, that it was prepared to provide additional financing on condition of a guarantee by an acceptable entity from within the CKD and a mortgage over Skoda Export\u2019s headquarters, was reasonable.260 The Respondent notes that HSBC took the same position.261\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 279.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 281.\n\n148.\n\nOn several occasions, Skoda Export informed CEB that the NEPRA decisions would be forthcoming.262\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6268, 282.\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the proposed use of the main office building of Skoda Export in downtown Prague as security for the extended guarantees would have prevented Skoda Export from securing the additional operating loans required to pay the company\u2019s suppliers.263 The Respondent points to Skoda Export\u2019s own offers to mortgage the building; to the participation of HSBC in communicating this requirement; and to the fact that the major part of the value of the building would still be left to secure the additional financing,264\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6287.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6288-290.\n\nThe Freezing Orders\n-------------------\n\n150.\n\nConcerns were raised when on Friday 17 April 2009, Skoda Export simultaneously filed payment orders seeking to withdraw a total of approximately USD 7 million from four accounts with CEB and USD 2.4 million from an account with HSBC.265 Since the accounts with CEB were pledged as security for financing already provided, intended withdrawals would have deprived CEB of potential cash security at a time when the guarantees provided for the Balloki project could have been called at any time.266 Given that Skoda Export had not informed CEB of the withdrawals notwithstanding its ongoing communications, CEB had \"serious concerns\".267\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6293.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 295.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 297.\n\n151.\n\nBecause of the suspicious nature of the transactions, CEB and HSBC were under an obligation to report the transactions under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.268\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6298-299.\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it was unreasonable of the CEB and HSBC not to retract the reports of suspicious transactions when the criminal investigation was pending.269 It points out that Skoda Export requested the cancellation or limitation of the freezing orders only on 29 May 2009, five weeks after the accounts were frozen and only a week before the freeze was lifted.270 The Respondent denies that the three-month duration of the criminal investigation into the reported transfers was unreasonable in the circumstances.271\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 302.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 304.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 306.\n\n153.\n\nThe responses of the financial institutions to the Claimant\u2019s financing requests, including discussion of finalisation of projects by a third party contractor, BTG, were not unreasonable and fell well within the scope of their commercial discretion.272\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 293-307 (the Freezing Orders), \u00b6\u00b6 337-369 (the final attempt by the financing institutions to find a solution); Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 132-148 (CEB and EGAP were not unreasonable in negotiations), \u00b6\u00b6 190-234 (re the reasonableness of the freezing orders),\n\n154.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s complaints of other alleged attempts to undermine Skoda Export - (i) debt collection proceedings by UJV Rez,273 (ii) alleged failure to execute payment orders;274 (iii) alleged preferential treatment of other credit applicants;275 and (iv) alleged harassment and intimidation276 - were unfounded and lacking in substance.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 372-377,\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 379-381.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 382-384.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 251-255.\n\n**6.

A mistaken intention does not render a legal act invalid.278\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6126; Letter from FITE to CEB, 24 April 2009, **C-50;** Letter from FITE to the Ministry of Finance, 24 April 2009, **C-51.**\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 127, citing Act 40/1964 Coll., Section 49a, 26 February 1964, **CLA-59.**\n\n156.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in direct response to the rescission of the SPA, the Czech Republic \"retaliated\" by freezing Skoda Export\u2019s bank accounts on various pretexts, as explained below.279\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 130.\n\n157.\n\nOn 17 April 2009, for the purpose of improving the transparency and efficiency of its treasury and cash management operations, Skoda Export gave instructions for the balances on certain barde accounts held with CEB, HSBC and Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 obchodni banka, a.s. **(\"CSOB\")** to be consolidated into proposed main accounts held with CEB and CSOB.280\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 131.\n\n158.\n\nInstead of giving effect to the transfers, on 22 **April** 2009, CEB and HSBC filed suspicious activity reports with the Financial Analytical Unit **of** the MoF (the **\"Financial Analytical Unit\"),281** stating that the bank transfers gave rise to a reasonable suspicion of asset stripping and money laundering, from which they stood to iose payments owed by Skoda Export.282 On 24 April 2009, at the request of the Financial Analytical Unit, the Unit for Investigation of Corruption and Financial Crime of the Criminal Police and Investigation Service Taxes and Money Laundering Division (the **\"Police Authority\")** commenced a criminal investigation into Skoda Export\u2019s bank transfers, and issued two resolutions **(the \"Freezing Orders\")** that froze seven of Skoda Export\u2019s bank accounts containing a total of CZK 204 million.283\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 132.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 132.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 135; Police Authority Resolutions, 24 April 2009, **C-53.**\n\n159.\n\nSkoda Export fully cooperated with the Police Authority in the six weeks that followed the imposition of the Freezing Orders, despite the severe disruption of its business.284\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 136.\n\n160.\n\nSkoda Export formally asked CEB on two occasions to notify the Financial Analytical Unit and Police Authority to retract the allegations made against Skoda Export.285 CEB refused to take any steps to correct the false information.286 On 29 May 2009, Skoda Export submitted a request to the District Prosecuting Attorney for Prague 1 (the **\"Prosecuting Authority\")** to lift the Freezing Orders. The Freezing Orders were lifted on 5 June 20 0 9.287\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 137.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 137.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 13 8.\n\n161.\n\nThe Freezing Orders had a severe negative impact on Skoda Export\u2019s business288 through the constraints on Skoda Export\u2019s liquidity and the reputational harm caused by news that it was under criminal investigation.289 According to the Claimant, the Freezing Orders were a direct cause of Skoda Export\u2019s entry into insolvency.290\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 154.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 154-155.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 157.\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimant also alleges that in early 2009, during negotiations over the future of Skoda Export, CEB attempted to divert Skoda Export\u2019s key assets to an entity named BTG, which *\"had no reputation or apparent experience in Skoda Export's field of business, but had a close relationship with CEB and the Ministry of 'Finance\"*.291 The attempt to have BTG take over the Key Projects from Skoda Export continued after the insolvency proceedings had commenced, in breach of Section 111 of the Czech Insolvency Act, which prohibits transfers that have a substantial impact on the property or assets of the debtor.292 This attempt was made by CEB and Its controlling authority, the MoF, with the intention of bankrupting Skoda Export and transferring its key assets to favoured third parties.293 The attempt was unsuccessful because Skoda Export\u2019s suppliers refused to transfer then-contracts to BTG due to BTG\u2019s inexperience in the EPC sector.294\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 141 -142.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 144\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 143.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 145.\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent allegedly engaged in a number of acts designed to undermine Skoda Export and harass and intimidate its employees, including a police search of [REDACTED] at Prague Airport in April 2009; statements published in press articles by the daily newspaper Miada Fronta Dnes; certain e-mail communications by the CEB with Skoda Export and with third parties; and debt collection proceedings brought on 15 June 2009 by UJV Rez, a partly state-owned subcontractor of Skoda Export.295\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 146-153.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimant abandoned the investment through the actions it took up to 24 April 2009, while the negotiations on financing were ongoing. These actions included (i) the resignation on 10 April 2009 of the Supervisory Board and 3 of the 4 members of the Board of Directors of Skoda Export;296 (ii) the attempt by Skoda Export to terminate the Balloki project on 22 April 2009;297 (iii) the change of control over Skoda Export by which Skoda Export ceased to be a member of CKD;298 (iv) the rescission of the SPA by FITE;299 and (v) the renaming of Skoda Export as CKD Export, a.s.300\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 310-312.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 313-315.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 316-325.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 326-335.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 336.\n\n165.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Freezing Orders were imposed in retaliation for the rescission of the SPA. Suspicious transaction reports were filed by HSBC and CEB on 20 April 2009, whereas the letter from FITE rescinding the SPA was delivered subsequently, on 24 April 2009, which was on the same day the Freezing Orders were being written by the Police Authority,301\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 332-334.\n\n166.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, following the rescission of the SPA, the financing banks continued to attempt to find a solution that would enable the completion of the Balloki and Muridke projects. The Respondent refers to a renewed request for additional financing made by Skoda Export on 29 May 2009, the response of CEB on 3 June 2009, and a proposal sent by CEB on 10 and 16 June 2009 concerning alternative strategies for the finalisation of the two projects,302 The proposals put forward by CEB counted on a third party finalising the projects.303 In this context, BTG contacted on 24 June 2009. The Respondent denies that BTG is an obscure company with no business record. According to the Respondent, BTG was a member of the BTG Group, a Slovak EPC contractor with significant experience and expertise.304 In its view the strategy of transferring the Balloki and Muridke projects to a third party would \"almost certainly have kept Skoda Export solvent\".305\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 338-344.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6344.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6348.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 351.\n\n**7.

According to the Claimant, the Respondent breached: (i) its obligation under the State Property Act by remaining passive and refusing to conduct a proper audit in the face of warnings concerning financial problems at Skoda Export; (ii) its obligations under Directive No. 1/2006 by failure of its officials delegated to the management of Skoda Export to supervise the management of Skoda Export and to prevent the mishandling of Skoda Export\u2019s assets; and (iii) its duty to act in good faith and in accordance with the requirements of fair business conduct by withholding the truth about Skoda Export\u2019s situation contrary to its best knowledge.347\n\nReply, \u00b6 339.\n\n190.\n\nThe violation of Article 2(3) by the aforementioned breaches of the SPA and of Czech law \"triggers the responsibility of the Czech Republic under the BIT and customary international law\" and \"elevates these breaches of the SPA and Czech law to the level of international law\".348 As a result, the Respondent\u2019s responsibility \"entails its duty to provide compensation for WNC\u2019s losses resulting from this breach, as a matter of public international law\",349\n\nReply, \u00b6 341.\n\nReply, \u00b6 341.\n\n**(2)The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondent contends that its conduct did not breach the SPA or Czech law.\n\n(a) Alleged breaches of the SPA\n-------------------------------\n\n192.\n\n**Asset disposal without disclosure:** The Respondent denies that it breached Clauses 5.2(h), 8(h), 8.3, 10.1(c) or 10.6 of the SPA by the omission to notify FITE during the bidding or contracting process of the termination of the Rio Turbio, NIPCCO and Bhikki projects.350\n\nStatement of Defence \u00b6\u00b6387-397.\n\n193.\n\nOf the relevant projects, \"Rio Turbio was in the bidding stage, and the project terminated because a competing bid was selected; NIPCCO was subject to a Memorandum of Understanding, and terminated because it did not proceed to the contracting phase; Bhikki was subject to a contract that was signed, but not effective, and terminated because agreement on amended price and time schedule could not be reached\".351\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 389.\n\n194.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent maintains that Clause 5.2(h) of the SPA is inapposite because all of these projects were \"merely unconsummated business prospects\". They \"were not assets in any of the accounting sense, the legal sense under Czech law, or the general sense of the word\"352 and as such were not capable of disposition.353 Further, the relevant events occurred \"in the ordinary course of business\" since the company\u2019s business was to seek to win bids and to turn winning bids into effective contracts;354 and the alleged \"asset disposition\" did not fulfil the materiality requirement of Clause 5.2(h) of the SPA.355\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 391.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6392,\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6393.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 394.\n\n195.\n\nAs regards its obligation under Clause 8.3 to inform FITE that the Bhikki, Rio Turbio and NIPCCO projects would not be consummated, the Respondent maintains that \"sufficiently clear information about the fact that these projects were extremely unlikely to proceed beyond the bidding stage was made available to FITE during the due diligence process of the tender\".356\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 561.\n\n196.\n\nThe Respondent notes that Clauses 10.1(c), 10.2 and 10.6 of the SPA are clauses regulating together the fulfilment of conditions precedent to the closing of the SPA, and require the Seller to confirm that all of the \"Seller\u2019s Warranties\", which are set out in Clause 5.1, are true, complete and correct in all material aspects. The Claimant \"does not allege a breach by Respondent of any of the warranties contained in Clause 5.1 of the SPA\".357\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 400.\n\n197.\n\n**Disclosure of issues affecting performance of obligations:** Concerning its obligations under Clause 10.6 of the SPA, the Respondent considers that Clause 10.6 of the SPA is inapposite. First, the obligation of FITE under Clause 6,l(v) of the SPA is not a condition precedent for the transaction contemplated by the SPA, and does not have to do with the validity or effectiveness of the SPA as a contract, and is consequently unrelated to Clause 10.6 of the SPA.358 Secondly, it was obvious that any number of the cases listed as \"Business Cases in Progress\" might not proceed to a final contract and execution.359 Thirdly, the Respondent contends that the Claimant had failed to abide by its \"core obligations under the SPA\".360\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 550.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 552.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 556.\n\n198.\n\n**Undertaking to comply with Czech laws and regulations:** As regards the alleged breach of Clause 5.1(c) of the SPA, the Respondent first raises two defences *in limine,* namely, that (i) the temporal dimension of Clause 5.1(c) is limited to the period between the signing and settlement dates of the SPA; and (ii) whereas this warranty relates to the legality of Respondent having entered into the SPA and complying with the specific obligations under the SPA itself, the Claimant neither alleges that Respondent\u2019s entering into the SPA would be illegal, nor that any one of Respondent\u2019s obligations in the SPA, if observed, would be illegal.361\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 541.\n\n199.\n\nEven if Clause 5.1(c) did apply to the allegations regarding the MoF\u2019s reaction to the letter from [REDACTED] concerning [REDACTED] the Respondent maintains that its response to that letter was entirely appropriate in the circumstances and that the Claimant does not explain how its own suggested approach would have been superior to the response of the MoF, in which himself was instrumental.362\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 543-544.\n\n200.\n\n**Implied representations:** Concerning the \"implied representations\" allegedly given to FITE, the Respondent points to the Parties\u2019 agreement at Clause 5.3 of the SPA that the representations and warranties contained in the SPA are the sole representations and warranties made by the Czech Republic to FITE and the warranty by FITE at Clause 6. l(n) of the SPA that it had not relied on any other warranties except for those explicitly made by the Czech Republic in the SPA.363 The Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s claims based on alleged additional \"implied\" warranties \"amounts to nothing else than a retroactive attempt to change the terms of the transaction\".364\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6426-427;

These exhaustively list the rights of the Czech Republic as a shareholder in Skoda Export, as well as the responsibilities of the members of the individual corporate bodies of the company in their dealings with the company and with third parties, including company shareholders.376 The Commercial Code enumerates *inter alia* the limitations on the extent to which a shareholder is entitled to receive information about the business affairs of the company.377\n\nStatement of Defence \u00b6\u00b6412-416.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 413.\n\n*(ii) Directive No. 1/2006 of the Ministry of Finance*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nConcerning MoF Directive No. 1/2006, the Respondent notes that this is an internal document of the MoF, which could not change the generally applicable legislation. The Respondent contends that there was no breach of Directive No. 1/2006.378\n\nStatement of Defence \u00b6\u00b6417-423.\n\n205.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Directive No. 1/2006 provides that the MoF could unilaterally instruct corporate bodies where it exercised shareholder control, or their members, regarding matters of privatization only on the basis of a specific agreement on the exercise of corporate control entered Into between the MoF and the relevant controlled company. No such agreement had been concluded between the Czech Republic and Skoda Export.379\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 422.\n\n*(iii) Other legislation cited by Claimant*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Privatization Act required the Czech Republic to prepare a privatization project in connection with the privatization of Skoda Export, with the purpose of identifying the property to be privatized. It contends that the privatization project which was prepared in respect of Skoda Export was consistent with the requirements of this Act.380 The Respondent notes, further, that the Act on Cancellation of the National Property Fund, Act No. 178/2005 Coll, cited by the Claimant, does not impose any specific or additional obligations on the State.381\n\nStatement of Defence \u00b6\u00b6404-407.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6424-425.\n\n(c) Application of Article 2(3) of the BIT to the alleged breaches of the SPA and of Czech law\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Respondent objects that the alleged breaches of Czech law and of the SPA are not covered by Article 2(3) of the BIT, and that the Tribunal accordingly lacks jurisdiction over such alleged breaches.\n\n208.\n\nBut even if the Tribunal were to uphold its jurisdiction over the alleged breaches of the SPA or Czech law on the basis that the SPA was a \"specific agreement\" under Article 2(3) of the BIT, the Claimant \"would still need to demonstrate that those obligations had been breached and would have to do so under the law that creates and sustains them, i.e. Czech law\".382 According to the Respondent, as a matter of Czech law, the SPA has not been breached, nor is there any plausible basis for alleging it to have been breached.383\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6519, referring to *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, S.C.

Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n**(1)The Claimant\u2019s position**\n------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent unlawfully expropriated its investment in breach of Article 5 of the BIT because (i) CEB and EGAP failed to provide critically needed financing for Skoda Export\u2019s projects;433 (ii) CEB and EGAP attempted to divert Skoda Export\u2019s projects to a third party contractor;434 and (iii) CEB acted to freeze Skoda Export\u2019s bank accounts on false and unsubstantiated charges.435 On the basis of these acts and omissions, the Claimant contends that the Czech Republic\u2019s unlawful expropriation engages its responsibility at international law.436\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 215-219;

Transcript, Day 1 at pp. 133-141, 144-145 (Claimant\u2019s Opening Statement, Dr Sinclair).\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that CEB and EGAP have a primary role in implementing governmental export policies; perform state functions conferred on them by legislation; are publicly accountable for their conduct; conceive themselves as being State entities charged with providing State support; are owned and controlled by the State, with supervisory bodies consisting of State officials; and receive extensive support from the State budget and have their losses covered by fiscal resources.442\n\nReply, \u00b6 262.\n\n232.\n\nThe Claimant points out that the mission of the CEB is conferred on it by Czech law under the Financing of Exports Act; that the Act requires the State to retain its majority ownership in CEB and exclusive control of CEB.443 The governmental function of the CEB is confirmed by the fact that it is subject to the scrutiny of the State Audit Office and that it is designated as an instrumentality in charge of implementing the State\u2019s export strategy by the official \"Export Policy\" of the Czech Republic between 2006 and 2010 (the \"Export **Policy\").444**\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 265-266.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 267-269.\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimant contends that EGAP, alongside CEB, is empowered by Czech law to exercise elements of governmental authority in the implementation of the foreign trade policy of the Czech Republic and is subject to the audit of the State Audit Office.445 Its funds for export credit risk are subsidized from the State budget.446\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 272-273.\n\nReply, \u00b6273.\n\n234.\n\nThe implementation of State policy by State entities qualifies as the exercise of governmental policy under the first element of Article 5 of the ILC Articles, citing numerous arbitral decisions to this effect.447\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 274-281.\n\n235.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that CEB and EGAP acted within the scope of their governmental authority in their conduct towards the Claimant\u2019s investment in violation of the BIT.448 The support received by Skoda Export from CEB and EGAP prior to its privatization was a \"dominant factor\" in its decision to turn to CEB and EGAP for financial assistance once the post-acquisition audit revealed the poor condition of the company.449 The letters from the Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance confirm that Skoda Export\u2019s relationship with CEB and EGAP fell within the ambit of their governmental mandate because when FITE approached the Ministry for assistance, the Ministry directed FITE to approach CEB and EGAP.450 According to the Claimant, the fact that FITE also submitted credit applications to other institutions is irrelevant, since those entities did not provide Skoda Export with the requisite financial support.451\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 282-289.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6282-283.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 284-287;

Rather, Mr Pokorny \"demanded\" the transfer of the Key Projects to BTG, an \"untrustworthy\" operator which lacked the necessary experience to complete the projects.460 CEB conducted meetings with customers and suppliers in a \"surreptitious and underhanded\" manner, and attempted to \"strong-arm\" Skoda Export\u2019s management into transferring the projects in a short period of time and under threat of death.461\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6383-384.\n\nReply, \u00b6 384; First Witness Statement of [REDACTED] (CWS-3), \u00b6 48.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s position**\n---------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it has breached Article 5 of the BIT on the grounds that (i) the conduct of the CEB and EGAP is not attributable to the Respondent under international law; (ii) even if such conduct were attributable to the Respondent, the challenged conduct constituted a legitimate exercise of police powers under international law; and (iii) Skoda Export\u2019s insolvency was not caused by the Czech Republic,462\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6575; Rejoinder, \u00b6 596.\n\n(a) Attribution of responsibility to the Czech Republic for the conduct of CEB and EGAP\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, none of the alleged conduct of CEB and EGAP is attributable to the Czech Republic, on the basis of Articles 4, 5, or 8 of the ILC Articles or otherwise.463\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6576-620; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 55 481-533; Transcript, Day 2 at pp. 75-84 (Respondent\u2019s Opening Statement, Mr Ali).\n\n245.\n\nThe Respondent notes *inter alia* that CEB operates as a bank subject to standard banking rules, while the state support of its activities is provided in the form of conditional subsidies of its income in the event that its commercial income is insufficient to cover expenses incurred in connection with the provision of export financing and in the form of guarantee of its financial obligations.464 CEB and EGAP operate closely in the provision of export financing.465 The business management of CEB is entrusted to its Board of Directors, and shareholders are not entitled to give instructions to the Board of Directors.466 Similarly, the business management of EGAP is entrusted to its Board of Directors, and as a matter of Czech law, shareholders cannot instruct the Board of Directors on matters concerning the business management of the insurer.467\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6586.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 592.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 588-589, citing Articles of Association of CEB, **R-196,** Section 14(6); Commercial Code, **RLA-6,** Section 194(4).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 594, citing Commercial Code, **RLA-6,** Section 194(4),\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent argues that none of the actions of CEB and EGAP complained of by the Claimant, even if they could be established as wrongful, can be attributed to the Czech Republic, on the grounds *inter alia* that neither CEB nor EGAP exercised governmental authority towards Skoda Export or the Claimant in connection with the alleged misconduct.468\n\nStatement of Defence, 596. It is common ground between the Parties that neither CEB nor EGAP is an organ of the Czech Republic (Art. 4 ILC Articles) and neither CEB nor EGAP acted towards the Claimant under the direction or control of the Czech Republic (Ail 8 ILC Articles): Reply, \u00b6\u00b6257-258.\n\n247.\n\nConcerning responsibility for the acts and omissions of entities or persons exercising elements of delegated governmental authority, under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, the Respondent contends that there is a two-pronged test to be satisfied under this Article, which is confirmed by consistent BIT jurisprudence.469 The allegedly unlawful act must, first, be performed by an entity specifically empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority and, secondly, must itself be performed in the exercise of such governmental authority.470\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 602, citing *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.

and the allegedly disproportionate nature of the CEB\u2019s response in failing first to raise its suspicions directly with Skoda Export.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 600.\n\n258.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the suspicious activity reports and the subsequent Freezing Orders were made in good faith fulfilment of legal obligations, under the Anti-Money Laundering Act and EU mandatory law, designed to prevent financial crimes.497 The Respondent notes that a payment can be suspicious without being illegal, and the Prosecuting Authority made no finding of bad faith.498 Concerning the alleged failure to communicate beforehand with Skoda Export, the Respondent notes that CEB was \"legally obliged\" not to report its suspicions to Skoda Export since this would undermine the purpose of the Anti-Money Laundering Act.499\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 604-606.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 607-608.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 610,\n\n259.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant has put forward no evidence or allegation that the failure to provide Skoda Export with additional financing and the proposed transfer of the Balloki and Muridke proj ects were anything other than legitimate exercises of police powers.500 The Respondent notes that the decisions on the relevant credit applications were made on the basis of a risk assessment of the transaction in question, and the proposal to transfer those projects to a third party was part of a good faith attempt to find terms on which the projects could be completed and Skoda Export could be disburdened from the obligations it had incurred.501\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 612-617.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 615, 617.\n\n(c) Whether the alleged conduct of the Respondent was the cause of Skoda Export\u2019s insolvency\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe Respondent denies that Skoda Export\u2019s insolvency was caused by the measures complained of by the Claimant, whether those measures are taken alone or cumulatively.502 Specifically, the Respondent denies that the insolvency of Skoda Export was caused by the failure to provide financing, the alleged harm to Skoda Export\u2019s relationship with its customers and sub-contractors, or the issuing of the suspicious activity reports and the Freezing Orders.503\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 631-638;

Skoda Export had stopped paying its external subcontractors on the Balloki and Muridke projects at the beginning of 2009 and did not make any payments to its creditors after the Freezing Orders were lifted.505\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 622.\n\n263.\n\nConcerning the transfer of projects to a third party, the Respondent observes that the Claimant has \"failed to explain why getting rid of defaulted and underfunded projects and the obligations associated with them would cause Skoda Export\u2019s insolvency\".506\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 623.\n\n264.\n\nThe failure to provide financing did not constitute an expropriatory measure because no riskconscious creditor would have provided financing, given the dire financial condition of Skoda Export, without requiring changes that would have restored its minimal financial viability such as the transfer of the Balloki and Muridke projects, or requiring security for additional credit. By refusing to accept such measures when they were proposed, the Claimant effectively declined to accept credit that was potentially available to it.507\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 624.\n\n265.\n\nThe Respondent adds that failure to provide assistance which would have been contrary to EU state aid iaw to a company in difficulty cannot constitute an expropriatory measure or every single bankruptcy of a company would constitute expropriation and every collapse of a foreign-owned company could result in a BIT claim.508\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 626.\n\n266.\n\nThe Respondent distinguishes the investment BIT award relied upon by the Claimant, *Eureko v. Poland,* on the grounds that In that case, the state had created a legitimate expectation that it would act and did not do so, whereas in the present case the Claimant had no legitimate expectation to the additional financing it had requested on non-commercial terms from CEB.509\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 630.\n\n**D.** Damages and quantum\n--------------------------\n\n**1.

First, FTI does not quantify loss to the Claimant because it does not quantify the value of Skoda Export but instead merely quantifies Skoda Export\u2019s cash flows, and even assuming cash flows were an appropriate measure of value, \"they could only be so to the extent they were lost by Claimant, not Skoda Export\", and any loss to the Claimant should be measured by the cash that would ultimately flowed up to the Claimant by way of dividends payable by Skoda Export.534 The value of any sums payable up to the Claimant as dividends would need to be calculated taking into account central office overheads, which the FTI Reports fail to take into account.535 Further, should the Claimant be correct in its allegation that the data on the Project Cards turned out to be misleading or false, \"this would necessarily mean that those Project Cards cannot represent profits or cash flows that Skoda Export could have earned and therefore cannot represent Claimant\u2019s losses\",536 Finally, the calculation is flawed because the value of Skoda Export\u2019s real estate is overstated and only that part of the premises which was not occupied by Skoda Export itself, amounting to 13 percent of the total office area, can be deemed an excess (redundant) asset whose value can be added to the damages calculated as the loss of cash flows.537\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 664, citing Second Expert Report of David Dearman **(REX-2),** \u00b6 3.2.2.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 668.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 666-667, citing Second Expert Report of David Dearman (REX-2), \u00b63.2.13.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 670-672.\n\n284.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the alternative calculation made by FIT based on \"the share purchase price paid for Skoda Export, cash flow generated from Transferred Projects... and a pre-Award interest\"538 is flawed.539 In particular, the amount of the damages thus calculated based on the purchase price is inflated due to the use of an incorrect exchange rate,540 and the projects identified as \"Transferred Projects\" \"either are not \"Transferred Projects\" or losses from them reasonably can be projected to be nil.\"541\n\nReply, \u00b6405.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 673.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 674, referring to Second Expert Report of David Dearman **(REX-2),** \u00b6\u00b6 4.2.1-4.2.3.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 674, referring to Second Expert Report of David Dearman **(REX-2),** section 4.3,\n\n**2.

Interest**\n---------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant\u2019s position**\n-------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nThe Claimant claims pre-award interest and asserts that \"the applicable statutory interest, which comes into effect as at the date a demand for damages is made, is 8 percent plus the repo rate set by the Czech National Bank for the first day of the calendar half-year in which the default occurred\", which currently stands at 8.05 percent.544 The Claimant contends that the same rate should apply after the rendering of the Tribunal\u2019s award.545\n\nReply, \u00b6 416.\n\nReply, \u00b6416.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s position**\n---------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the interest claimed by the Claimant is unreasonable. The Claimant claims pre-award interest at \"the risk free rate of US Treasury bills plus a premium of 3 percent\" whereas the Respondent contends that the appropriate standard is the interest rate payable on the loan FITE obtained from PPF Bank to acquire Skoda Export, namely, \"3 month PROBOR plus 1.69%\".546\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 685.\n\n289.\n\nWith regard to post-award interest, the Respondent contends that the Claimant misinterprets Czech law by a defective translation of Regulation No. 351/2013 Coll. **(\"Regulation 351\").** Regulation 351 sets out not \"statutory interest\" as contended by Claimant, but \"default interest\". The rate of statutory interest is found in Section 1802 of the Czech Civil Code, which refers to the \"interest required on loans provided by banks in the place of residence or seat of the debtor at the time of entering into a contract\".547 The Respondent contends that the purpose of the BIT would not be served by the application of the default rate established by Regulation 351, which is concerned with sanctions imposed on debtors to discourage future late payment of their obligations.548 Rather, as the award would constitute Respondent\u2019s debt towards the Claimant, it would be \"fundamentally unfair\" to apply the interest rate of 8.05 percent as requested by the Claimant, and the proper post-award interest rate is nil.549\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 688-690, citing Regulation No. 351/2013 Coll., Art. 2, 16 October 2013, CLA-58, Regulation No. 351/2013 Coll, (corrected translation), RLA-177; Act No. 89/2012 Coll., Civil Code, RLA-121.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 690; Directive 2011/7/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on combating late payment in commercial transactions (recast), OJL 48/1, 23.2.2011, RLA-178.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 693,\n\n290.\n\nAlternatively, the rate of post-award interest should not be higher than Claimant\u2019s own cost of funds, which the Respondent calculates at 1.98 percent per annum, based on the interest rate offered by PPF Bank at the time of the loan agreement dated 24 April 2009, 3 month PRIBOR (currently 0.29 percent) plus 1.69 percent per annum.550\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 692, 694; Loan Agreement between PPF Bank and CEX dated 24 April 2008, **R-64,** Article III(1); PRIBORRates, monthly and yearly averages, year 2016, **R-337.**\n\n291.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, international and Czech law both require simple interest in connection with the payment of an arbitral award?551 Any interest granted to the Claimant should be simple and not compounded.552\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 695-697; *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5, Award, 23 September 2003 RLA-179, \u00b6 395; Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v.

THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S CONCLUSIONS**\n----------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nIn reaching its determination of the claims herein, the Tribunal has had regard to the entirety of each Party\u2019s memorials, statements, exhibits and other filed documents and attachments and oral evidence, and written and oral submissions, including skeleton outlines, post-hearing briefs, aide memoires and transcripts of hearings.\n\n**A. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nAs a preliminary observation, it is to be recalled that jurisdiction arising under a BIT is conferred and defined by the terms of that treaty. Where jurisdictional objections arise from disputed facts (for example whether there has been an \"investment\"), the onus is upon the Claimant to establish those facts. However, where, as here, the objections arise from the construction of specific provisions of the BIT, the Tribunal must apply the principles of interpretation reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties **(\"VCLT\").** Issues of onus do not come into play and the process of interpretation engaged in by the Tribunal determines the result.\n\n**1. The intra-EU BIT jurisdictional objection**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the basis that the BIT has been superseded by EU law.553 It contends that the BIT has been terminated pursuant to Article 59(1) of the VCLT. Alternatively, it is not applicable to the present case under Article 30(3) of the VCLT. The objection has two limbs.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 510-514; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 398-413.\n\n295.\n\n**Limb (1):** The Respondent says that EU law has the same subject matter as the BIT because it provides protection to investors from one Member State in connection with investing in another Member State. The Respondent points to laws which guarantee freedom of movement of capital and freedom of establishment,554 as well as investors\u2019 access to the courts of EU Member States.555 Second, the rights and protections in the BIT are only available to investors from the UK and the Czech Republic. The Respondent contends that the BIT consequently discriminates on grounds of nationality against investors from other EU States, contrary to rules laid down in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union **(\"TFEU\").**556 In light of the subject matter overlap and the incompatibility of the laws, and given the BIT is the earlier instrument, the Respondent says that the BIT should be considered terminated under VCLT Article 59(1).557 Alternatively, it says that under VCLT Article 30(3) the BIT cannot be applied in the present case.558\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 512.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 405,\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 512.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 512.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 512.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal makes the preliminary observation that the Respondent\u2019s objection is not clearly pleaded in its Statement of Defence. The Respondent refers to the VCLT\u2019s rules in footnotes and does not explain how its arguments relate to or satisfy the elements of those rules. The Respondent also advances its case under both the subjective and objective elements in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) to Article 59(1), when only the latter is open to it on its pleaded case. These defects are not remedied in its Rejoinder, \u00b6 Notwithstanding this, the Tribunal takes the first limb of the Respondent\u2019s argument to be directed towards the \u2018sameness\u2019 criterion in Articles 59(1) and 30(1) of the VCLT (i.e., that the treaties share the same subject matter), whilst the second limb is directed towards the criterion of incompatibility between the treaties in Articles 59(1)(b) and 30(3). Viewed in this way, any \"confusion or conflation between sameness and incompatibility\"559 can be overcome and the Tribunal can proceed to determine the objection.\n\n*European American Investment Bank AG (EURAM)* v. *Slovak Republic,* Award on Jurisdiction, 22 October 201 \u00b6 173.\n\n297.\n\nThe grounds advanced by the Respondent in support of its objection have been considered and consistently rejected by a number of arbitral tribunals. The Respondent acknowledges this,560 but calls on the Tribunal to disregard these decisions on the grounds that they \"have either applied EU law incorrectly, or are incomplete and irrelevant\".561 The Respondent also relies on recent public statements made by the EC that intra-EU BITs have been superseded by EU law;562 it also refers to enforcement action taken by the EC against EU Member States in this area.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 513; Rejoinder, \u00b6 407.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 407,\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 513; Rejoinder, \u00b6 **1** 406.\n\n298.\n\nArbitral tribunals have consistently held that EU law and BITs do not have the same subject matter on the basis that EU law does not offer equivalent procedural or substantive protections to foreign investors. Tribunals have been particularly persuaded by the fact that EU law does not provide investors with a right to institute an arbitration against a host state. For instance, in *Eastern Sugar* v. *Czech Republic* it was decided that:\n\nThe BIT also provides for a special procedural protection in the form of arbitration between the investor state and the host state and, especially arbitration of a \"mixed\" or \"diagonal\" type between the investor and the host state, as in the present case... From the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the arbitration clause is in practice the most essential provision of Bilateral Investment Treaties.... EU law does not provide such a guarantee.563\n\n*Eastern Sugar B. V. (Netherlands)* v *Czech Republic,* Partial Award, 27 March 2007, CLA-69, \u00b6\u00b6 164-165. This was endorsed in *European American Investment Bank AG (EURAM) v Slovak Republic,* Award on Jurisdiction, 22 October 2012, RLA-24, \u00b6\u00b6 180, 182.\n\n299.\n\nThe tribunal in *Rupert Binder v. Czech Republic* reached the same conclusion, holding that \"investor-state arbitration is not addressed by EC law, and the EC legal order has not offered a substitute for investor-state arbitration\".564\n\n*Rupert Binder v. Czech Republic,* Award on Jurisdiction, 6 June 2007, \u00b6 40.\n\n300.\n\nThe Respondent argues that EU law protects foreign investment by providing investors access to Member State courts,565 But in many cases suits in municipal courts under EU law do not offer the same advantages as independent arbitration under an investment BIT. This issue was considered in *Eureko B.V. v. Slovakia* in relation to the claimant\u2019s right to arbitrate under the BIT between the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia. The tribunal held that:\n\nSuch a consensual arbitration under well-established arbitration rules adopted by the United Nations, in a neutral, place and with a neutral appointing authority, cannot be equated simply with the legal right to bring legal proceedings before the national courts of the host state; and, moreover, the locus standi of an investor under the BIT, with its broad definition of \"indirect\" investments under Article 1, is unlikely to be replicated under the court procedures of an EU Member State.566\n\nThe situation is no different in the present case under Article 8(2) of the BIT, which provides *inter alia* for arbitration by an *ad hoc* tribunal under the UNCITRAL Rules\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 405.\n\n*Eureko B.V.* v. *Slovakia,* Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, 26 October 2010, CLA-70, \u00b6 264.\n\n301.\n\nTribunals have also concluded that the substantive protections offered to investors in investment treaties are not available under EU law. In *Eastern Sugar,* it was resolved that the right to move capital in and out of different jurisdictions within the EU, and to invest in a host state with the same rights and entitlements as a local investor, are not co-ordinate with the right to FET and the prohibition on expropriation.567 In *Eureko* it was accepted that \"It is at least arguable that there is a duplication of rights to free movement of capital, which exist both under the BIT and under EU law.\"568 However, in that case the tribunal was comparing a right to free transfer of profits and dividends under the BIT with the right to free movement of capital under EU law. In the present suit, the Claimant does not rely on an equivalent protection under the BIT (such as Article 6, which provides for repatriation of investment and returns) and so the juxtaposition of these two protections need not be made.\n\n*Eastern Sugar B. V. (Netherlands) v. Czech Republic,* Partial Award, 27 March 2007, CLA-69, \u00b6\u00b6 161,163,\n\n*Eureko B. V. v. Slovakia,* Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, 26 October 2010, CLA-70, \u00b6 249.\n\n302.\n\nIn *Eureko,* the tribunal considered whether freedom of establishment under EU law was co-ordinate with protection from expropriation. It stated that:\n\nSimilarly, the protection in Article 5 of the BIT against expropriation is by no means covered by the EU freedom of establishment. While it certainly overlaps with the right to property secured by Article 17 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (and the First Protocol to the ECHR, as applied under EU law), the BIT provision on expropriation is not obviously co-extensive with it. Both the considerable body of jurisprudence on indirect takings that has emerged in the context of BITs, and also the fact that the BIT protects \"assets\" and \"investments\" rather than the arguably narrower concepts of \"possessions\" and \"property\" protected by the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights, give rise to the possibility of wider protection under the BIT than is enjoyed under EU law.569\n\n*Eureko B. V. v. Slovakia,* Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, 26 October 2010, CLA-70, \u00b6 261.\n\n303.\n\nConsistently with these BIT authorities, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent\u2019s contention that freedom of establishment is co-ordinate with protection from expropriation.\n\n304.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the *Eastern Sugar, EURAM* and *Eureko* awards and argues that the Tribunal should not have regard to those decisions because they applied EU law incorrectly or are incomplete and irrelevant.\n\n305.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the tribunal in *Eastern Sugar* incorrectly states that EU law does not offer protection during the time in which an investment is in place in a host state.570 In doing so, however, it mischaracterises a statement made by the tribunal in the context of the right to free movement of capital and not EU law in general. The tribunal stated as follows:\n\nThe European Union guarantees the free movement of capital. Thus, it guarantees to non-Czech investors from other EU member countries the right to invest in the Czech Republic on a par with any Czech investor.... Similarly, the European Union guarantees the free movement of capital outwards, thus, the investor may take out profits and even the investment as such out of the host country. By contrast, the BIT provides for fair and equitable treatment of the investor *during* the investor's investment in the host country, prohibits expropriation, and guarantees full protection and security and the like.\n\nThe *Eastern Sugar* tribunal\u2019s comparison of the free movement of capital with BIT protections is brief, but its distinction between capital inflows and outflows on the one hand, and the treatment afforded to investments whilst operating *in situ* is apposite. Indeed this distinction is enlivened in the present case, where the Claimant seeks to rely on the FET standard both with respect to the acquisition of Skoda Export and its treatment by CEB. While free movement of capital might complement the FET standard in respect to the acquisition, it is difficult to see how it could be invoked with respect to the treatment of FITE or Skoda Export (as domestically incorporated companies) by a Czech bank. On this basis, the Respondent\u2019s arguments with respect to *Eastern Sugar* must be rejected.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 408.\n\n306.\n\nThe Respondent condemns the *EURAM* award because the tribunal \"fundamentally misunderstood EU law\".571 Yet one need only look at the extract of the award presented by the Respondent to appreciate that - whether or not it was accurate as a matter of law ~ the tribunal\u2019s statement was not determinative of its finding on the intra-EU jurisdictional objection in that case. The extract begins with \"The Tribunal wishes to add that.viewed in its context, the extracted paragraph follows a substantive analysis by the Tribunal in which it evaluates the different subject matter of EU law and the BIT. Again, the Tribunal is not persuaded to reject the reasoning in *EURAM.*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 410.\n\n307.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the findings in *Eureko* are not applicable because it considered EU law \"before the Lisbon Treaty came into force, amending the EU Treaty and the EC Treaty (now the TFEU).\"572 Yet the Respondent does not explain how developments in EU law following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty align the subject matter of EU law with that contained in the BIT. For instance, one of the reasons the inter-EU jurisdictional objection was rejected in *Eureko* was because EU law contained no equivalent of the arbitration clause in the BIT. The Lisbon Treaty (and other subsequent EU law) has not changed this fact, and, on this basis, the legal framework considered by the tribunal in 2008 does not seem materially different to that in place today.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 411, citing *Eureko B.V.* v. *Slovakia,* Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, 26 October 2010, **CLA-70,** \u00b6 218.\n\n308.\n\nIt follows that the Respondent has not established that EU law relates to the same subject matter of BIT under Articles 59(1) or 30 of the VCLT. Accordingly, the first limb of its jurisdictional objection must fail.\n\n309.\n\n**Limb (2):** The second limb of the Respondent\u2019s EU law objection, under Articles 59(1)(b) and 30(3) of the VCLT, likewise fails. It is argued that there is an incompatibility between EU law and the BIT. But the BIT does not discriminate on the grounds of nationality against EU investors from third states. The fact that the BIT affords certain rights not available to other EU investors does not make the BIT discriminatory; there is nothing in the BIT that prevents investors of other states claiming equal rights under the BIT. It also does not bar investors of non-party states from accessing commensurate protections under EU law. As the tribunal observed in *Eastern Sugar:*\n\nIf the EU Treaty gives more rights than does the BIT, then all EU parties, including the Netherlands and Dutch investors, may claim those rights. If the BIT gives rights to the Netherlands and to Dutch investors that it does not give other EU countries and investors, it will be for those other countries and investors to claim their equal rights. But the fact that these rights are unequal does not make them incompatible.573\n\n*Eastern Sugar B. V. (Netherlands)* v. *Czech Republic,* Partial Award, 27 March 2007, **CLA-69,** \u00b6 170.\n\n310.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument about the effect of EU law on jurisdiction under the BIT. As already noted, a number of investor-State tribunals have considered the question, of intra-EU BITs and to date they have all concluded that the intra-EU BIT before them has legal force and effect.574 There is no principle of binding precedent in international law. Each case must be decided on its own merits and each tribunal must consider the case before it as pleaded by the disputing parties. Nonetheless, to the extent that they are based on sound legal reasoning, the decisions of tribunals in prior international law cases can provide useful insights to subsequent tribunals considering those issues.\n\nSee, e.g., *Charanne B. V. Construction Investments S.A.R.L. v. Kingdom of Spain,* Final Award, 16 January 2016; *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a.r.l.* v. *Spain,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 June 2016; *PVInvestors* v. *Spain* (UNCITRAL Rules) Award on Jurisdiction, 2016; *EDF v. Hungary,* Award on Jurisdiction, 3 December 2014, *Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, **RLA-78.**\n\n311.\n\nOf course EU law was modified by the Treaty of Lisbon, and the EC has been developing its views of the legal questions involved with intra-EU investment treaties; the European Court of Justice has also expressed views about related questions of competence and will no doubt define its position more precisely in due course. The Tribunal recognizes that a different view may eventually prevail. However, this Tribunal is obligated under the BIT to decide this case based on the consent of the States parties as set out in the text of the BIT, and on the arguments presented by the Parties. This it has done.\n\n**2. Jurisdiction in respect of the SPA under the Umbrella Clause Article 2(3)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s second jurisdictional objection relates to the SPA between FITE and the Czech Republic for the acquisition of Skoda Export. The Respondent contends that the Umbrella Clause in the BIT (Article 2(3)) does not apply to the SPA because the SPA is not an agreement between the Czech Republic and the Claimant, but between the Czech Republic and FITE.575 FITE is a Czech joint stock company, which is owned as to 70% by CKD Praha DIZ a.s. and as to 30% by CKD NOVE Energo a.s. The Claimant is an English holding company that was the majority shareholder of CKD during the privatisation. Accordingly, there is no agreement between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party as contemplated in Article 2(3).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 497-509; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 418-458.\n\n313.\n\nThe Claimant seeks to refute the Respondent\u2019s objection on the basis that the Umbrella Clause contains no privity of contract requirement.576\n\nReply, \u00b6 198.\n\n314.\n\nIt is first necessary to consider the relevant provisions of the BIT. Article 2(3) provides that:\n\nInvestors of one Contracting Party may conclude with the other Contracting Party specific agreements, the provision and effect of which, unless more beneficial to the investor, shall not be at variance with this Agreement. Each Contracting Party shall, with regard the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, observe tire provisions of these specific agreements, as well as the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n315.\n\n\"Investors\" in respect of the United Kingdom are defined under Article 1 (c)(ii) to mean:\n\n(aa) Physical persons deriving their status as United Kingdom nationals horn the law in force in the United Kingdom;\n\n(bb) corporations, firms and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of the United Kingdom or in any territory to which this Agreement is extended in accordance with the provisions of Article 12,\n\n316.\n\n\"Investments\" is defined in Article 1 (a) as:\n\n[E]very kind of asset belonging to an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party under the law in force of the latter Contracting Party in any sector of economic activity...\n\nArticle 1(a) enumerates a non-exhaustive list of different types of asset.\n\n**(1) \"Specific agreements\" under BIT Article 2(3)**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nAlthough \"specific agreements\" is not a defined term in Article 1, the Tribunal accepts that the first sentence of Article 2(3) applies to give the term definition. This much is apparent from the second sentence, which refers back to *\"these* specific agreements\", thus creating a *renvoi* to the scope given to \"specific agreements\" in the first sentence. Hence the ordinary meaning of the first sentence is that a specific agreement is one between an investor (as defined) and a Contracting Party.\n\n318.\n\nFITE is not an investor of the UK because it is incorporated in the Czech Republic, and there is no deeming provision giving it standing as a wholly-owned subsidiary.577 Therefore, *prima facie,* the SPA is not a \"specific agreement\" within the meaning of Article 2(3).\n\nCf ICSID Convention, Art 25(3).\n\n319.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, as there is no privity of contract requirement in Article 2(3), it is immaterial whether the investor concludes the specific agreement directly or through an investment vehicle. Put another way, there must be an express privity of contract requirement for the Umbrella Clause to be restricted to agreements between a UK investor and the Czech Republic.\n\n320.\n\nThe Parties joined issue on the requirement of privity under umbrella clauses in general. But even if there is no requirement of privity under umbrella clauses couched in general terms (e.g. \"any obligation entered into with regard to investments\"), in contrast, the BIT uses quite precise language: it refers to \"specific agreements\" which are to be concluded between a Contracting Party and an. investor of the other Contracting Party. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, in accordance with the governing principle of treaty interpretation, this language must be given effect, and it follows that the SPA is not a specific agreement for the purposes of Article 2(3).\n\n**(2) Observation of undertakings in international law**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe term \"umbrella clause\" is often used as a convenient shorthand for \"observation of undertaking\". That nomenclature does not expand the scope of the obligation to observe an undertaking under international law. An undertaking is a formal and legally binding pledge to do something. States are obliged under international law to observe their undertakings. This is, *inter alia,* part of the duty of good faith and the principle of *pacta sunt servanda.*\n\n322.\n\nThe obligation to observe an undertaking is owed by the State that has given the undertaking. It is owed to the party to which the undertaking has been given. It is not a freely transferrable obligation, without the consent of the State that has given the undertaking (although such consent can be identified in different ways, including by way of a treaty or a contract governed by municipal law). The requisite elements of an undertaking to be observed under international law are a specific, clear and direct commitment from a State to an identified beneficiary. It is not sufficient, for example, that there be a general policy, a generic statement of principle, a general legal principle or a municipal law of universal application (which would not include a law specifically identified to provide foreign investment with protections or a law formalising a concession agreement).\n\n323.\n\nAn undertaking is likewise owed to the identified beneficiary of the undertaking. Under international law, merely because a State may owe an obligation to observe an undertaking given to a company does not mean that the State also owes that same obligation to observe the undertaking to that company\u2019s shareholders. Of course, that principle is subject to any specific transfer provisions, such as in agreements to extend the benefit of the undertaking to shareholders, affiliates, heirs or assignees.\n\n324.\n\nThe scope of the obligation to observe an undertaking is separate and distinct from other obligations under international law. Thus, it is not coterminous with the principles of FET. Although an entity might have legitimate expectations in relation to an undertaking, that does not convert it into the beneficiary of the undertaking. Nor does it expand the obligation of the undertaking State so as to make it beholden to anyone other than the beneficiary.\n\n**(3) Privity of contract under umbrella clauses**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe issue of the requirement of privity under umbrella clauses has been addressed in a number of investment BIT arbitrations. There is no consensus, but the dominant view is that in respect of contractual obligations, only parties entitled to enforce the obligation under the proper law of the contract may sue.\n\n326.\n\nIn *Azurix Corp. v. Argentina**,* the tribunal considered whether it had jurisdiction under the umbrella clause in the US/Argentina BIT to consider obligations arising from a concession agreement between the Claimant\u2019s subsidiary and the Provence of Buenos Aires, The umbrella clause provided that \"[e]ach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\" The tribunal held as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal finds that none of the contractual claims as such refer to a contract between the parties to these proceedings; neither the Province [of Buenos Aires] nor ABA are parties to them. While Azurix may submit a claim under the BIT for breaches by Argentina, there is no undertaking to be honored by Argentina to Azurix other than the obligations under the BIT. Even if for argument\u2019s sake, it would be possible under Article II(2)(c) to hold Argentina responsible for the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement by the Province, it was ABA and not Azurix which was the party to this Agreement.578\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic,* Award, 14 July 2006, CLA-35, \u00b6384.\n\n327.\n\nIn *Siemens v. Argentina**,* the tribunal held that: \"to the extent that the obligations assumed by the State party are of a contractual nature, such obligations must originate in a contract between the State party to the BIT and the foreign investor.579 On this basis, the tribunal concluded that obligations in a contract between Siemens\u2019 subsidiary and Argentina did not qualify under the umbrella clause in the BIT between Germany and Argentina.\n\n*Siemens A.G.* v. *The Argentine Republic,* Award, 17 January 2007, CLA-44, \u00b6 205\n\n328.\n\nIn 2007, the Annulment Committee in *CMS v. Argentina* criticised the tribunal for its seemingly broad interpretation of the umbrella clause in the Argentina/US BIT,580 which gave CMS standing to enforce obligations in a licence agreement between Argentina and a company in which CMS was a minority shareholder. The Annulment Committee observed that there were \"major difficulties\" with this reading of the umbrella clause, including, *inter alia:*\n\n(b) Consensual obligations are not entered into *erga omnes* but with regard to particular' persons. Similarly the performance of such obligations or requirements occurs with regard to, and as between, obligor and obligee.\n\n(c) The effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into something else; the content of the obligation is unaffected, as is its proper law.\n\nIf this is so, it would appear that the parties to the obligation (i.e,, the persons bound by it and entitled to rely on it) are likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella clause.581\n\nThe Tribunal did not express this interpretation, but it is implied by its finding that Argentina breached obligations under the umbrella clause arising under the licence agreement: *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Republic of Argentina,* Decision of the ad hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, 25 September 2007, RLA-37, \u00b6\u00b6 93-94,\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Republic of Argentina,* Decision of the ad hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, 25 September 2007, RLA-37, \u00b695.\n\n329.\n\nin *Burlington Resources v. Ecuador**,* the tribunal determined that the claimant could not rely on the umbrella clause in the US/Ecuador BIT to enforce production sharing contracts entered into between the claimant\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary and Ecuador. As with the umbrella clause in the US/Argentina BIT considered *ra. Azurix* and *CMS,* the US/Ecuador BIT required each state party to \"observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"582 The tribunal articulated the following test to interpret the umbrella clause:\n\nThe word \"obligation\" is thus the operative term of the umbrella clause. The BIT does not define \"obligation\". The Parties agree - and rightly so - that the clause refers to legal obligations. This is of little assistance, however, to resolve the question of privity. To answer this question, the Tribunal relies primarily on two elements which in its view inform the ordinary meaning of \"obligation.\" First, in its ordinary meaning, the obligation of one subject is generally seen in correlation with the right of another. Or, differently worded, someone's breach of an obligation corresponds to the breach of another's right. An obligation entails a party bound by it and another one benefiting from it, in other words, entails an obligor and an obligee. Second, an obligation does not exist in a vacuum. It is subject to a governing law. Although the notion of obligation is used in an international BIT, the court or tribunal interpreting the BIT may have to look to municipal law to give it content. This is not peculiar to \"obligation\"; it applies to other notions found in investment treaties, e.g. nationality, property, exhaustion of local remedies to name just these. In this case, the PSCs are governed by Ecuadorian law. It is that law that defines the content of the obligation including the scope of and the parties to the undertaking, i.e. the obligor and the obligee.583\n\nIn respect of the first element, it can be seen that the tribunal elaborates on the concept of reciprocity between \"obligee\" and \"obligor\" raised in *CMS* v. *Argentina.*\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* Decision on Liability, 14 December 2012, **RLA-46,** \u00b6211.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* Decision on Liability, 14 December 2012, **RLA-46,** \u00b6 **214****,**\n\n330.\n\nIn *Oxus Gold v. Uzbekistan**,* one of the grounds on which the tribunal decided that the claimant could not rely on an umbrella clause to import obligations from an exploration agreement was because \"the parties to the PEA are Goskomgeology and Marakand and not the State and Oxus.\"584 Goskomgeology was a State Committee of Uzbekistan and Marakand was a subsidiary of Oxus.\n\n*Oxus Goldplc* v. *Republic of Uzbekistan, the State Committee of Uzbekistan for Geology & Mineral Resources, and Navoi Mining & Metallurgical Kombinat,* Award, 17 December 2015, **RLA-147,** \u00b6 **377****.**\n\n331.\n\nFinally, it is necessary to consider *Continental Casualty v. Argentina.* This case has been raised by the Claimant in support of the conclusion that umbrella clauses apply to obligations between an investor\u2019s subsidiary and a host state.585 The Claimant refers to *Continental Casualty* only in respect of its alternative submission that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under broader umbrella clauses in other BITs through the MFN provision in the BIT (discussed below). However, it is relevant to look at it here, in order to determine whether it impacts on the line of reasoning considered above.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 210-211.\n\n332.\n\n*Continental Casualty* concerned the same US/Argentina BIT umbrella clause that was considered in *Azurix* and *CMS.* With respect to the umbrella clause, the tribunal observed:\n\nFinally, provided that these obligations have been entered \"with regard\" to investments, they may have been entered with persons or entities other than foreign investors themselves, so that an undertaking by the host State with a subsidiary such as CNA is not in principle excluded.586\n\n*Continental Casualty Company* v. *Argentine Republic,* Award, 5 September 2008, **RLA-65,** \u00b6 297.\n\n333.\n\nThis statement is seemingly in conflict with the cases considered above. However, there are a number of reasons why *Continental Casualty* should not upset the otherwise consistent jurisprudence on the privity objection. First, in making this statement, the tribunal was referring to obligations of the host state in general and not contractual promises in particular. Second, the tribunal did not ultimately pursue its investigation of whether contractual obligations of Argentina were justiciable under the umbrella clause because it had already decided Argentina could rely on the defence of necessity with respect to those obligations.587 As such, it did not need to conduct a full analysis of the issue or engage with cases that had resolved similar questions. Finally, it commented that the contracts in question \"could,..be considered as guaranteed by the umbrella clause, subject to the caveat that they were not directed to foreign investors nor specifically addressed to their investments\".588 Accordingly, it is not apparent that the contracts would have fallen under the umbrella clause even if the tribunal had taken this question to its conclusion.\n\n*Continental Casualty Company* v. *Argentine Republic,* Award, 5 September 2008, RLA-65, \u00b6\u00b6 302-303.\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* Award, 5 September 2008, **RLA-65,** \u00b6 302.\n\n334.\n\nTo summarise, the Claimant\u2019s contention that there is no requirement of privity in relation to umbrella clauses finds no authoritative support in the case law of international investment tribunals. To the contrary, tribunals have rather consistently resolved that they have **no** jurisdiction under umbrella clauses to consider contractual obligations between host states and investors\u2019 locally incorporated subsidiaries.\n\n335.\n\nIf it were necessary to do so, the Tribunal would uphold the requirement of privity even for generally worded umbrella clauses, which are intended to give effect to legal commitments entered into by the host state with regard to investments, not to change their scope or content.\n\n336.\n\nThis conclusion is reinforced by applying the reasoning of the tribunal in *Burlington,* which noted that tribunals may have to look to municipal law to give content to an obligation. The tribunal observed that \"Burlington has not alleged, not to speak of established, that trader Ecuadorian law the non-signatory parent of a contract party may directly enforce its subsidiary's rights.\"589 Similarly, the Claimant has not suggested that Czech law would entitle it to enforce the rights of FITE under the SPA.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc.* v. *Republic of Ecuador,* Decision on Liability, 14 December 2012, RLA-46, \u00b6215.\n\n337.\n\nThe *Burlington* tribunal added:\n\nAs to the terms \"with regard to investments\" also employed by the relevant BIT provision, they denote a \"link between the obligation and the investment\" as Burlington argued at the hearing. This is certainly in keeping with the object and purpose of the BIT, which are to encourage and protect investments. However, as Ecuador pleaded, this link \"does not replace but qualifies\" the notion of obligation. If there is no obligation in the first place, there is nothing to qualify. Nor can these qualifications create an \"obligation\" where there is none to begin with.590\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc.* v. *Republic of Ecuador,* Decision on Liability, 14 December 2012, RLA-46,\u00b6\u00b6 216-217.\n\n338.\n\nThe Claimant seeks to distinguish the present case from those considered above on the basis that the SPA \"includes multiple warranties applying to FITE and its \u2018Affiliates\u2019, including WNC\".591 It refers in this respect to *EDF v. Argentina**,* where the tribunal held that it had jurisdiction to consider breaches of a concession agreement between a company in which the Claimants owned shares and the Government of Mendoza. The tribunal rejected Argentina\u2019s privity objection on the following basis:\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 12 of the Concession Agreement makes explicit mention of shareholders. That provision prohibits shareholders from transferring EDEMSA shares without prior consent from EPRE, Respondent itself mentions at paragraph 231 of its Counter-Memorial that the Concession Agreement required authorization by the Executive Power for the transfer of EDEMSA's majority shareholding during the first 5 years of the agreement\u2019s effective date.592\n\nReply, \u00b6 201.\n\n*EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* Award, 11 June 2012, CLA-61, \u00b6 942.\n\n339.\n\nIt is apparent from this extract that the Concession Agreement in the *EDF* case imposed a positive contractual obligation on the claimant companies not to transfer shares without prior consent. In short, they were parties to the transaction, not merely beneficiaries. The SPA, however, does not impose contractual obligations on the Claimant. Rather, FITE assumes certain contractual obligations that extend to the conduct or state of affairs of the Claimant. This occurs in Clause 6.1(h) of the SPA, which provides:\n\nThe Purchaser [FITE] warrants to the Seller on the Signing Date that all the below facts (the Purchaser\u2019s Warranties) are true, complete and correct and undertakes to ensure that the facts remain true, complete and correct on each of the following days until and including the Settlement Date:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n(h) neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates are party to any judicial proceedings or any arbitration proceedings against the Czech Republic and/or the Company...593\n\nIt is apparent to the Tribunal that Clause 6.1(h) is a contractual promise made solely by FITE which does not bind the Claimant. As the SPA imposes no obligation on the Claimant, the Claimant and the Respondent cannot be said have a relationship of obligor and obligee. The Claimant has no standing to enforce any obligation under the SPA merely because it is referred to (in generic terms, i.e., as an \"Affiliate\") in certain provisions.\n\nUnder clause 1.1 of the SPA, \u2018Affiliate\u2019 means \u2018in relation to any person, any other person that directly or indirectly, through one or more persons, controls that person, is controlled by it or is controlled along with that person.\u2019 The Claimant would thus have been an \u2018Affiliate\u2019 of FITE.\n\n340.\n\nThe Claimant argues that a restrictive interpretation of Article 2(3) would enable the Respondent \"to circumvent the BIT by prescribing domestic incorporation\" as a condition of acquiring Skoda Export.594 It says that this \"would lead to a manifestly absurd result and should be rejected\".595 But as the seller in an open tender process, the Respondent was free to impose such a condition, and any potential bidder was free not to bid on those terms. It cannot be said that, if a foreign investor voluntarily enters into an agreement which is clearly excluded from the plain terms of an umbrella clause, there is a manifestly absurd result. This is all the more so because such an agreement would not preclude the investor from recourse to other protections open to it *qua* investor under the BIT,\n\nReply, \u00b6 199.\n\nReply, \u00b6 200.\n\n**(4) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n341.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunal upholds the Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction in respect of the Umbrella Clause claims, insofar as they concern obligations under the SPA, on the basis that the SPA is not a specific agreement under Article 2(3) of the BIT.\n\n**3. Jurisdiction in respect of Czech law under the Umbrella Clause**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nThe Claimant invokes the Umbrella Clause not only in respect of alleged breaches of the SPA, but also for alleged violations of Czech law. It alleges that the Respondent:\n\n(a) violated an express warranty in the SPA that it had complied with its own legal obligations, including under Czech law;596 and\n\n(b) breached \"its implied contractual obligations of good faith under Czech law towards FITE in the negotiation, execution and performance of the SPA\".597\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 106,290-312.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 180.\n\n343.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that the Umbrella Clause does not cover or concern provisions of general legislation addressed to the public,598\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6483.\n\n344.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s first allegation (a) relates to clause 5.1(c) of the SPA, by which the Respondent warranted that:\n\nentering into this Agreement or by the meeting of the Seller\u2019s obligations under this Agreement will not result in any...breach of any valid legal regulation applicable to the Seller.\n\n345.\n\nThe warranty does not impose any new obligation on the Respondent. What it does do is provide FITE with a right to seek damages for a breach of domestic law by the MoF. But that right arises from the SPA and is only enforceable by FITE. Article 2(3) does not extend rights to the Claimant because the SPA is not a \"specific agreement\": see paragraph 320. Consequently, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider the Claimant\u2019s first allegation.\n\n346.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s second allegation (b) also presents difficulties. The Claimant does not point to any source of Czech law to support its contention that there is an implied obligation of good faith when negotiating agreements. For this reason, it is difficult for the Tribunal to analyse the content of any such obligation. But even considering this question in the abstract, it is uncontroversial that umbrella clauses do not elevate states\u2019 domestic laws to the level of the BIT or convert them into promises. The Annulment Committee in *CMS* stated that:\n\nIn speaking of \"any obligations it may have entered into with regard to investments\", it seems clear that Article II(2)(c) is concerned with consensual obligations arising independently of the BIT itself (i.e. under the law of the host State or possibly under international law). Further they must be specific obligations concerning the investment. They do not cover general requirements imposed by the law of the host State.599\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company* v. *The Republic of* Argentina, Decision of the ad hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, 25 September 2007, **RLA-37,** \u00b6 95(a),\n\n347.\n\nEven in *Continental Casualty**,* which seemingly departed from other cases on the scope of umbrella clauses, it was held that the \"umbrella clause does not come into play when the breach complained of concerns general obligations arising from the law of the host State\".600 On this basis, the umbrella clause does not afford the Tribunal jurisdiction to consider the Claimant\u2019s second allegation.\n\n*Continental Casualty Company* v. *The Argentine Republic,* Award, 5 September 2008, **RLA-65,** \u00b6300.\n\n**4. Article 3(1): Jurisdiction under the Umbrella Clause through the MFN clause**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded there is no \"specific agreement\" under Article 2(3). But it must also consider the Claimant\u2019s alternative argument that jurisdiction is established under more favourable umbrella clauses in other BITs to which the Respondent is party.601 The Claimant contends that it would be entitled to rely on more favourable umbrella clauses pursuant to Article 3(1), which provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall ensure that under its law investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party are granted treatment not less favourable than that which it accords to investments or returns of its own investors or to investments or returns of investors of any third State.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 204-213.\n\n349.\n\nThe immediate problem with the Claimant\u2019s reliance on the MFN provision is that, *prima facie,* the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear disputes arising under Article 3. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction derives from Article 8(1) of the BIT, which provides that:\n\nDisputes between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under Articles 2(3), 4, 5 and 6 of this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former which have not been amicably settled shall, after a period of four months from written notification of a claim, be submitted to arbitration under paragraph 2 below if either party to the dispute so wishes.\n\n350.\n\nThis part of the Claimant\u2019s case concerns a dispute as to the application and interpretation of the Article 3, which is not provided for in Article 8(1).\n\n351.\n\nThe Claimant makes the argument that, because Article 2(3) of the BIT is activated by the existence of a \"specific agreement\", the second sentence of the Article applies to extend jurisdiction to all substantive obligations in the BIT.602 The Claimant makes this argument in order to bring its FET claim under Article 2(2) of the BIT within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, but the argument could in principle apply with respect to Article 3(1). However, as the Tribunal has already resolved that there is no \"specific agreement\" under Article 2(3), that provision cannot be relied upon to expand the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. But even if the SPA. were a \"specific agreement\", for the reasons which follow, the Tribunal would not agree with the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of the second sentence of Article 2(3).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 214-218; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 162.\n\n352.\n\nThe ordinary meaning to be given to the second sentence of Article 2(3) is to be informed by the context of that sentence within wider text **of** the BIT, including Article 8(1).\n\n353.\n\nThe meaning of Article 8(1) is clear. The only obligations that may be the subject of arbitration are those contained in the specified articles, including Article 2(3). If Article 8(1) did not exist, the effect of the second sentence of Article 2(3) might well be as the Claimant interprets it. But read in conjunction with Article 8(1), it is clear that it cannot be intended to extend an arbitral tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to all other substantive obligations in the BIT. If that were the case, Article 8(1) would be superfluous. In this respect, the Tribunal concurs with the Respondent\u2019s *effet utile* argument.\n\n354.\n\nThe second sentence of Article 2(3) must be read in the context of Article 2(3) in its entirety as well as the structure of Article 2 generally. Article 2 is divided into three parts; each imposes a substantive obligation on the Contracting Parties. The first relates to the admission of foreign capital, the second to FET and the third to investor-State contracts. The second sentence of Article 2(3) does not sit apart as a separate requirement. It is included in Article 2(3) and therefore the Tribunal would infer that its effect was intended to be limited to the Umbrella Clause.\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal also does not consider that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation is right. The Respondent\u2019s view is that the second sentence is merely intended to ensure that national courts considering a specific agreement take into account all applicable law, including the BIT.603 But this cannot be correct because there is no reference to courts or what they need to consider. To the contrary, the obligation in question is imposed expressly on the Contracting Parties under the BIT.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 477.\n\n356.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the correct interpretation of the second sentence of Article 2(3) is that the Contracting Party has an obligation both to adhere to the specific agreement and to observe the BIT protections in so far as those protections are contained in the specific agreement. Thus, if a specific agreement contained a protection tantamount to the FET standard, a tribunal would have jurisdiction to consider a breach of that standard. This interpretation gives effect to the ordinary meaning of Article 2(3) when read in its context. It links with the idea in the first sentence of Article 2(3) that specific agreements might contain protections equivalent or superior to (but not less than) those contained in the BIT. It also has an *effet utile* in that it bars a respondent party from arguing there is no jurisdiction to hear a claim based on an obligation in a specific agreement where that obligation is mirrored in the BIT but not captured by Article 8(1).\n\n357.\n\nIf the SPA is not a \"specific agreement\", then the Claimant cannot rely on Article 2(3) to expand the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. However, even if the Tribunal had held that the SPA was a \"specific agreement\", it does not contain protections commensurate with or superior to the protections in the BIT that are not covered by Article 8(1).\n\n358.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the Claimant\u2019s arguments based on the MFN clause,\n\n**5. Exclusive jurisdiction of Czech Courts**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that claims in respect of the SPA are inadmissible because Czech courts have exclusive jurisdiction over those claims.604 In its view, if the Claimant wishes to enforce the obligations in the SPA, it must comply with the modalities of enforcement of those obligations in the SPA.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 530-536; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 459-472.\n\n360.\n\nIn the SPA, dispute resolution is addressed by Clause XIV, which provides:\n\nAny dispute that arises between the Parties based on or in connection with this Agreement shall be decided by the court in Prague having subject-matter jurisdiction, unless exclusive jurisdiction of a court is stipulated.\n\n361.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the line of cases holding that umbrella clause claims brought contrary to an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the relevant contract are inadmissible.605 Since, for the reasons stated, the Umbrella Clause claim falls outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on other grounds, the issue of admissibility need not be further discussed.\n\nRelevant cases include *BIVAC BV v. Republic of Paraguay,* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 29 May 2009, **RLA-54,** \u00b6 148; *SGS Soc\u00ed\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance* v. *Republic of Philippines,* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004, **RLA-43,** \u00b6 155.\n\n**6. Jurisdiction over the FET claim**\n--------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear the Claimant\u2019s FET claim because Article 8(1) does not extend to claims arising under Article 2(2).606 The Claimant responds that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to hear its FET claim under Article 2(2) arises by virtue of the operation of Article 2(3).607 As the Tribunal has already decided, in relation to the MFN clause, Article 2(3) cannot operate to extend the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction beyond Article 8(1) in the absence of a \"specific agreement\". Accordingly, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear to the FET claim arising under Article 2(2).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 442.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 214-218; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 162.\n\n**7. Jurisdiction over the expropriation claim**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, as the Respondent conceded during argument,608 it has jurisdiction to hear the Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim as Article 8(1) of the BIT extends to disputes arising *inter alia* under Article 5.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 78.\n\n**8. Jurisdiction over the general international law claim**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Claimant further requests that the Tribunal declare that the Respondent has breached international law in relation to the Claimant\u2019s investment.609 As the Tribunal has already decided, in relation to other claims submitted by the Claimant, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is constrained by Article 8(1). It matters not whether the facts before the Tribunal might have given rise to a claim under international law or under provisions of the BIT not listed in Article 8(1). Although principles of international law are of course applicable to the interpretation of that Article and, indeed, the entire BIT, they cannot on their own provide a basis to expand the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction as expressly set out in Article 8(1). Accordingly, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear to the Claimant\u2019s general international law claim.\n\nClaimant Post-Hearing brief \u00b6 247(b).\n\n**B.** Liability\n----------------\n\n365.\n\nAs the Tribunal has decided that it does not have jurisdiction to hear claims under the Umbrella Clause or the FET clause, the Tribunal Is confined to the Claimant\u2019s remaining expropriation claim.\n\n366.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s principal expropriation case is that the Respondent dealt its investment three critical blows which resulted in its \"destruction\".610 First, CEB and EGAP failed to provide critically needed funding. Second, CEB and EGAP attempted to divert its projects to third parties. Finally, CEB and the MoF acted to freeze Skoda Export\u2019s bank accounts.\n\nReply, \u00b6 360.\n\n367.\n\nThe Claimant, in its Statement of Claim, reserved the right to advance an expanded expropriation claim in the event the Tribunal made a determination (as it has done) that it has no jurisdiction to hear the Umbrella Clause or FET claims. The Claimant said that its expanded expropriation case would be based on all the factual allegations it makes in the case. It contended that:\n\nthe Czech Republic\u2019s blatant and deliberate misrepresentations in connection with, the SPA can and should be conceptualised as the first of a series of acts that gradually and directly caused the complete devaluation of the Claimant\u2019s investment, until the complete extinguishment of its value.611\n\nReply, \u00b6 229.\n\n368.\n\nHowever, the Claimant did not plead out its expanded case in its pleadings or at the hearing. Moreover, it did not elaborate on the individual allegations which would make up the expanded expropriation claim. In the absence of any pleadings on the broader claim, the Respondent could not be expected to, and did not in fact, defend the claim. For its part, the Tribunal is not in a position to make any determination with respect to the expanded expropriation claim. Even if it were in a position to do so, it notes that there would likely be serious difficulties in establishing that events occurring prior to the sale of Skoda Export to FITE were expropriatory In character. This is because the investment in question had not come into existence at that time and so it is unlikely that it could be considered to have been taken (or partially taken) by the Respondent.\n\n**1. The expropriation claim**\n------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent, through EGAP and CEB, offered export financing for Skoda Export\u2019s projects on unreasonable and unconscionable terms, terms that the institutions knew were impossible for Skoda Export to accept.612 The Respondent knew that the requested finance was critical to Skoda Export\u2019s projects and its failure to offer financing on acceptable terms resulted in the expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s investment.613\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6215.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 218-219.\n\n370.\n\nThe Claimant further alleges that CEB and EGAP attempted to divert Skoda Export\u2019s projects to a third party contractor, BTG. These acts damaged Skoda Export\u2019s reputation and relationships at a critical stage.614\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 220-222.\n\n371.\n\nFinally, the Claimant alleges that CEB took steps to freeze Skoda Export\u2019s bank accounts on false and unsubstantiated grounds. Further, once the Freezing Orders were in place, the Respondent did not take adequate steps to have them lifted,615\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6222-223.\n\n372.\n\nThe Claimant contends that these three events directly caused Skoda Export\u2019s insolvency. It argues that the Freezing Orders prevented it from meeting its obligations to creditors and irreparably damaged its reputation.616 This, it says, was a direct cause of a flood of bankruptcy petitions in June 2009 and the declaration of insolvency made by the Insolvency Court in November 2009,617 The Claimant does not expect to receive any distribution from the liquidation in respect of its equity in Skoda Export.618\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6156.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 160-161.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 163.\n\n373.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the above events formed part of a campaign against Skoda Export that was \"triggered by the personal vendetta of high-ranking officials of the Respondent against who orchestrated measures intended to inflict damage upon [REDACTED] business interest in the Czech Republic, including Skoda Export\".619\n\nReply, \u00b6354.\n\n374.\n\nThe Respondent disputes each allegation made by the Claimant and denies the existence of a conspiracy against Skoda Export. It further says that it has not breached Article 5 of the BIT on the grounds that (i) the conduct of the CEB and EGAP is not attributable to the Respondent under international law; (ii) even If such conduct were attributable to the Respondent, the Freezing Orders constituted a legitimate exercise of police powers under international law; and (iii) Skoda Export\u2019s insolvency was not caused by the Czech Republic.620\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 575; Rejoinder, \u00b6 596.\n\n**2. Analysis of the expropriation claim**\n------------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nThe expropriation claim gives rise to a number of distinct legal and factual questions which require determination. The Tribunal will first make findings with respect to the factual allegations made by the Claimant. It will then consider whether the Claimant has made out its expropriation claim under Article 5 of the BIT.\n\n376.\n\nBased on the material available to the Tribunal, there are serious issues which arise in attributing the conduct of CEB and GAP to the Respondent under Article 5 of the ILC Articles. However, consistent with the decision in *Waste Management**,621* the Tribunal does not need to consider the attribution issue unless it finds that there is conduct capable of breaching the expropriation standard in the BIT.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States (No 2),* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award dated 30 April 2004, RLA-71, \u00b6 75.\n\n**(1) Factual allegations**\n---------------------------\n\n(a) Existence of a conspiracy\n-----------------------------\n\n377.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the MoF was CEB\u2019s puppeteer in a campaign by the bank against Skoda Export. The Claimant says, for instance, that \"senior government officials used aggressive tactics against [REDACTED] to induce him to cease broadcasting the Ministry\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation during the privatisation..,\"622 It also contends that \"[bfoth the Ministry and CEB knew that such an investigation would place undue pressure on Skoda Export and could lead it, as it eventually did, to bankruptcy\".623 However, the Claimant adduced no evidence to corroborate its allegation of conspiracy. Its case relies on the witness evidence of [REDACTED], who in turn relied on supposition and inference. For instance, he said:\n\nMr Pokorny would not have acted in this way unless he was certain to have the support of the Czech Ministry of Finance, and more precisely the Minister of Finance at the time, Mr Kalousek. Mr Pokorny\u2019s hostile behaviour continued even after Mr Kalousek was replaced by Mr Eduard Janota in May 2009. I believe that Messrs Kalousek and Janota were fully aware at all times of the status of CKD\u2019s negotiations with CEB, and also of the requests that CEB was making of CKD in the context of the financing package. Messrs Kalousek and Janota would have been aware that CEB was seeking to transfer Skoda Export\u2019s projects to BTG Energy.624\n\nReply, \u00b6 354.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 134.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of [REDACTED] **(CWS-5),** \u00b6 14; see also Second Witness Statement of (CWS-9), \u00b6l3.\n\n378.\n\nThe Claimant also referred to the minutes of the CEB Directors meeting of 23 April 2009, and in particular the board\u2019s decision \u2018to inform the Czech Ministry of Finance... about the entire case\u2019, as evidence of the Ministry\u2019s invisible hand in the affair.625 But it does not follow from the Ministry\u2019s subsequent awareness of CF.B\u2019s treatment that the Ministry instructed, or directed and controlled, CEB\u2019s treatment *ex ante.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-flearing Brief, \u00b6 111.\n\n379.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant asks the Tribunal to draw an adverse inference from Minister Kalousek\u2019s failure to appear and give evidence at the hearing,626 Minister Kalousek has (or should have had) much to say on that topic. But the Claimant has not produced even *prima facie* evidence supporting the alleged conspiracy, and the Tribunal is not in a position to draw any adverse inference against Minister Kalousek *vis-\u00e0-vis* the MoF\u2019s involvement in CEB\u2019s treatment of Skoda Export. Regrettable though Minister Kalousek\u2019s declining to make himself available even by video link may have been, the Tribunal does not think that an adverse inference, standing alone and unsupported by other evidence, can carry the day.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 157.\n\n(b) Failure to provide critically needed funding\n------------------------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nThe Claimant sought a loan from CEB for CZK 1 billion (USD 60 million), which CEB refused to grant. The Claimant says that, while there was no legal obligation on CEB to provide the funding, \"providing assistance to Skoda Export would have been seen either as a form of compensation or settlement of legal claims arising out of the SPA, or as a reasonable commercial transaction\".627\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 100.\n\n381.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case is thus framed in two ways. First, the Respondent owed the Claimant damages by virtue of its breaches of the SPA, and the way this debt should have been discharged was through a grant or soft loan framed as made by CEB as the principal liable for repayment or alternatively to be expressed as repayable conditional upon the receipt of moneys from the impugned and doubtful projects. This was the proposed route because state aid rules would have prevented the Respondent from making the payment or loans directly. Additionally, it was seeking a loan from CEB on \"commercial terms\" and that CEB acted unreasonably in rejecting its terms and imposing more onerous conditions,\n\n382.\n\nApart from the live issue whether the proposals for uncertain and conditional obligations for repayment without adequate security may be characterised as \"commercial\", in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, these two arguments are contradictory and mutually undermining. With respect to the first argument, it is not possible that a loan can be equated with a compensation payment as a loan would require repayment with interest and hence would not compensate for the damage suffered by the Claimant. As to the second argument, it cannot be said that a loan sought to compensate for alleged damages suffered by the Claimant is a loan on commercial terms.\n\n383.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the loan would have been commercial for CEB because to not grant it and to let the projects fail would necessarily result in the Respondent having to pay out the projects\u2019 customers a sum of up to USD 70 million on guarantees earlier given.628 But if CEB thought that the projects were unlikely to be successful, it could well have been more prudent for it to cut its losses and forfeit USD 70 million than to commit an additional USD 60 million and risk losing almost double its original investment. There are a number of reasons why CEB might have thought the projects were no longer safe investments,629 including that NEPRA had not approved any increase in the project payments,630 which was the only thing that would have made either project (marginally) profitable and allowed for the repayment of the loan amounts. In the absence of that decision there was a great risk of throwing good money after bad.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 102.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 153-155.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 92 ; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 154.\n\n384.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that CEB\u2019s refusal to grant the loan to Skoda Export on the terms demanded was nothing more than a commercial decision which CEB was free to malee as it saw fit. There was no obligation on CEB to grant the loan arising from legal claims made by the Claimant against the Respondent or otherwise. Nor, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, was the decision to refuse funding shown to have been part of any broader conspiracy to undermine and erode the value of Skoda Export.\n\n(c) Transfer of Skoda Export\u2019s projects\n---------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThis part of the Claimant\u2019s case concerns allegations that CEB and EGAP attempted to transfer the Claimant\u2019s key projects to third parties. It allegedly did so by bullying and threatening the Claimant\u2019s senior management631 and by approaching the Claimant\u2019s stakeholders with information about the proposed transfer.632\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 114-118.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6113.\n\n386.\n\nThe Respondent does not deny that it entered into discussions with stakeholders regarding a transfer of the projects.633 However, it disputes the allegations of threats and disagrees with the timing of events proposed by the Claimant. The Claimant suggests that the attempts to transfer happened from April 2009,634 whereas the Respondent says they occurred from June 2009.635 Moreover, the parties disagree as to motive. The Claimant alleges it was a corrupt attempt at enrichment for a member of CEB.636 The Respondent says that it was a commercial move to rescue the projects after they had been *de facto* abandoned by the Claimant.637 Moreover, it says that its attempts to transfer were openly discussed with the Claimant and that the Claimant was in principle open to the idea.638\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 182,\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Plearing Brief, \u00b6113.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post- Hearing Brief, \u00b6183.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6183.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 183.\n\n387.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the allegations of threats and harassment against the Claimant\u2019s management are not made out on the evidence. The evidence relied upon, in respect of the meeting with CEB, is the witness testimony of [REDACTED]. It is not corroborated by contemporaneous documentary evidence. Moreover, the Respondent in its Post-Hearing Brief shows the inconsistencies in [REDACTED] witness statements and oral testimony, successfully undermining the credibility of his evidence.639 The other evidence is of SMS messages sent to [REDACTED] However, as the Claimant concedes in its Post-Hearing Brief, these were sent from disposable phones and SIM cards and the police were not able to connect them with any individual or organisation,640 As such, the Tribunal has no basis to find that they originated from CEB or one of its affiliates.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 195-199.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 116.\n\n388.\n\nFurthermore, it is clear on the evidence that from 21 June 2009, the Claimant was at least open to discussing the transfer of its projects with CEB, This is born out in emails produced by the Parties. On 10 June 2009, Mr Porkony sent an email to [REDACTED] discussing the takeover of the projects.641 On the same day, [REDACTED] responded, stating he wants \"to discuss the provision of additional finance etc[REDACTED] I don\u2019t think that a takeover was ever a topic\".642 Yet, by 16 June 2009, a director of CEB sent a proposal for the transfer to [REDACTED],643 who responded on 21 June 2009 that he was \"ready to negotiate with [CEB] about the proposed arrangement\".644 Given the Claimant was open to the possibility of transferring projects, it cannot complain of discussions had by CEB about this possibility with relevant suitors and stakeholders.\n\nEmails between [REDACTED] and L. Pokorny, 10 June 2009, C-146, p. 1.\n\nEmails between [REDACTED] and L. Pokorny, 10 June 2009, C-146, p. 1.\n\nE-mail from [REDACTED] to Tlusty dated 21 June 2009, R-155, pp. 2-3.\n\nE-mail from [REDACTED] to Tlusty dated 21 June 2009, R-155, pp. 2-3.\n\n(d) Freezing of bank accounts\n-----------------------------\n\n389.\n\nWith respect to the Freezing Orders, it is alleged that CEB (with the knowledge and support of the MoF) acted to freeze the Skoda Export\u2019s accounts on the basis of false and unsubstantiated charges.645 It also alleges that CEB was under an obligation to consult with and inform the Claimant of its concerns about the transactions prior to notifying the authorities.646 The submission is that for these reasons the freezing of Skoda Export\u2019s accounts with CEB was unlawful.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 130-140.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 143.\n\n390.\n\nAs to the first complaint, although the Tribunal need not make a positive finding, at the least it appears to the Tribunal that, as the Respondent contends, the circumstances summarised in paragraph 161 of the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief *ex facie,* and as otherwise established by the actions taken by WNC to rescind the SPA and cast adrift its control of FITE during the last 14 days of April 2009, suffice to justify the administrative actions leading to the Freezing Orders being made,\n\n391.\n\nAs to the second complaint, the Claimant points to no positive legal obligation on banks to contact or inform customers prior to notifying authorities of suspicious transactions. To the contrary, banks are prohibited from warning customers that a suspicious activity report is, or is likely, to be filed.647 Whilst banks have an inspection obligation648 - meaning that they need to do some due diligence on the transaction before notifying authorities - this does not necessarily require the making of enquiries of the customer. This position is, as far as the Tribunal is aware, general in Europe, and not an idiosyncrasy of Czech money-laundering regulations.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 220-221.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 144.\n\n392.\n\nThe only corroborating documentary evidence adduced by the Claimant in support of its allegation that the filing of the suspicious activity reports was improper is the decision by the Prague District State Attorney\u2019s Office lifting the Freezing Orders.649 The Claimant says that it was found that \"the suspicious transaction reports filed by CEB were baseless and unwarranted, and that CEB was aware of the negative impact that the Freezing Orders would have on Skoda Export\u2019s ability to complete its projects\".650 However, this report is directed merely to the outcome of the enquiries enlivened by the making of the Report, not to the propriety of the circumstances under which it was made. The conclusion of the Report by the District State Attorney was as follows:\n\nBased on this evidence, it can no longer be inferred that the financial funds of PA EXPORT, a.s. carried on the accounts of these banks were designated to committing a crime. Therefore, the attachment of the cash funds is no longer required and may be lifted.\n\nThe report is not critical of CEB, and there is nothing to support the Claimant\u2019s contention that CEB acted improperly in filing a suspicious activity report.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 137-138; Reply, \u00b6 377; Ruling of the District State Attorney\u2019s Office for Prague 1, 5 June 2009, with English translation, **C-58.**\n\nReply, \u00b6 377.\n\n393.\n\nThe Claimant further alleges that, after the Freezing Orders were imposed, \"the Police Authority took an inordinate amount of time to conduct its investigation\".651 But the Claimant does not further substantiate this claim. In fact, it explains that it submitted a request to the District State Attorney\u2019s Office to lift the Freezing Orders on 28 May 2009 and that the request was granted on 5 June 2009.652 In the circumstances there is nothing to suggest that the authorities were unresponsive or untimely in investigating and lifting the Freezing Orders.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 136.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 138.\n\n394.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the steps taken to impose and maintain the Freezing Orders were \"legitimate actions in pursuit of the exercise of the police powers of the state.\"653 The Claimant \"accepts that in certain cases the legitimate exercise of [police] powers would not result in an obligation to compensate the Claimant\".654 However, it says that the powers must be exercised: (i) in good faith; (ii) for a public purpose; (iii) in a way proportional to that purpose; and (iv) in a non-discriminatory manner.655\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 622.\n\nReply, \u00b6 376.\n\nReply, \u00b6 376.\n\n395.\n\nIt is uncontroversial that \"States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory maimer *bona fide* regulations that are aimed at the general welfare\".656 In the present case, based on the evidence before it, the Tribunal is satisfied that the imposition of the Freezing Orders meets the four criteria stipulated by the Claimant. As explained above, CEB acted in accordance with money laundering rules and the District State Attorney\u2019s Office investigated the basis for the Freezing Orders in a timely manner and directed that they be lifted.\n\n*Saluka Investments B. V.* v. *The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, CLA-19,\u00b6 255.\n\n**(2) Did the Respondent\u2019s conduct amount to expropriation?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided, with respect to each allegation made by the Claimant, that there was no unlawful or improper conduct on the part of the Respondent. It has also determined that there was no conspiracy implicating the MoF and connecting the three events. That being so, the events complained of were not, in the circumstances, expropriatory acts. The refusal to grant the loan and the discussions regarding transfer of assets were commercial decisions by CEB, made with the knowledge and involvement of the Claimant. The decision to report the suspicious transfers was taken in accordance with applicable money-laundering legislation and the Freezing Orders were lifted promptly. These were not regulatory acts which had the effect of confiscating, or unreasonably interfering in the enjoyment of, the investment.\n\n397.\n\nAs the tribunal in *Pope & Talbot Inc v. Canada* noted, \"[t]he test is whether that interference is sufficiently restrictive to support the conclusion that the property has been \u2018taken\u2019 from the owner\".657 Even taking the (overly) broad definition of expropriation in *Metalclad Corporation* v. *Mexico**,* the interference with the use of the property must have *\"the effect* of depriving the owner\" of the expected economic benefit of the property.658\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc v Government of Canada,* Interim Award, 26 June 2000,\u00b6 102.\n\n*Metalclad Corporation* v. *United Mexican States,* Award, 30 August 2000, CLA-45, \u00b6 103, Emphasis added.\n\n398.\n\nIt can be a difficult task to pinpoint any one event (or even a series of events) which directly results in a company not being able to pay its debts. Skoda Export suffered from management problems and was mired in financial difficulty before its acquisition by FITE. The company had a plethora of competing financial commitments under a number of contracts across a range of jurisdictions. For instance, the Respondent points to payments of CZK 300 million made by Skoda Export to consultants at ETAL, Ashfield and Sky Invest between June 2008 and April 2009.659 In these circumstances, it is difficult to accept that these three isolated events caused its demise. More likely, it was the accumulation of numerous internal decisions taken over a number of years, combined with various market and political factors in the Czech Republic and the countries in which it operated.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 174.\n\n399.\n\nWith respect to the apparent attempts by CEB and EGAP to transfer Skoda Export\u2019s assets, no actual transfer took place. At most the harm from this activity was reputational. Reputational problems do not provide a legal basis for the filing of bankruptcy petitions or for a declaration of insolvency. It is also not apparent that the Freezing Orders were the cause, or even a cause, of the insolvency. Skoda Export failed to make payments to its creditors both before and after the Freezing Orders were imposed. It also wrote to CEB and EGAP regarding its dire financial predicament before the Freezing Orders were put in place.660 For instance, a restructuring plan the Respondent emailed to EGAP on 6 April 2009 provided:\n\nThe above co-operation/financial aid is required within the order of weeks; otherwise, the following is impending/has already occurred:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n(b) Collapse of CEX at the end of April 2009!661\n\nThe orders were imposed on 24 April 2009 and were in place for 29 business days. The Claimant has not shown that the failure to pay creditors within that period resulted in its bankruptcy and insolvency. It has also not shown that, absent these events, Skoda Export would not have been made insolvent or that, in the event it were declared insolvent, FITE would have recovered some value in the liquidation.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 206.\n\nLetter from [REDACTED] to EGAP, attaching CKD Export Restructuring Action Plan Summary, 9/2008- 12/2009, 6 April 2009, C-96, p.8.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusions**\n---------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has not breached Article 5 of the BIT. In summary:\n\n(a) The conduct of the Respondent prior to the sale of Skoda Export cannot fall within Article 5 because the investment did not exist at that time;\n\n(b) There is no evidence of any conspiracy on the paid of the Respondent to destroy Skoda Export. Thus there is nothing to link together the individual acts said to give rise to the expropriation;\n\n(c) CEB\u2019s decision to refuse funding was not an expropriation of Skoda Export. In the absence of any obligation to provide a loan to Skoda Export, the refusal was nothing more than a commercial decision which CEB was free to make in any way it chose. In addition, the Claimant has not proved that the failure to obtain finance was a factor which directly resulted in its bankruptcy and eventual insolvency;\n\n(d) CEB and EGAP\u2019s discussions with stakeholders regarding the transfer of assets were made with the knowledge and (at least tacit) consent of the Claimant. Moreover, as no actual transfer took place, there was no taking of the assets which could constitute an expropriation;\n\n(e) The imposition and maintenance of the Freezing Orders was a legitimate exercise of police powers by the Respondent. In any event, the Claimant has not proved that the Freezing Orders were a direct cause of its insolvency.\n\n401.\n\nIt follows as to issues of liability that the Claimant\u2019s claims, as set out in paragraph 58 above, wholly fail from a combination of objections on grounds of admissibility and jurisdiction and on the merits on the expropriation ground for breach of Article 5 obligations, including any claims alleging breach of international law other than that arising under the BIT.\n\n402.\n\n**Damages:** Hence, the claims for damages and quantum and other relief set out in Part D above do not fall for consideration.\n\n403.\n\n**Orders:** It follows also that the Respondent is entitled to declarations, that -\n\n(1) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over alleged breaches of the BIT other than arising under Article 5; and\n\n**(2)** The Respondent has not breached the BIT;\n\nand that the Claimant\u2019s claims stand dismissed.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**1. Costs claimed by the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant**\n--------------------\n\n404.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the total costs it incurred in this matter, as set out in the Claimant\u2019s Costs Schedule, are reasonable in all the circumstances.662 The Claimant requests that the Tribunal \"order the Respondent to pay all costs incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators as well as legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimant on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a reasonable commercial rate to be determined by the Tribunal, compounded annually, accruing from the date of the Award until payment in full.\"663\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 246; Claimant\u2019s Costs Schedule annexed to Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 247(f).\n\n405.\n\nThe Claimant claims its total costs in the amount of USD 6,117,315.06.664\n\nClaimant\u2019s Costs Schedule annexed to Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief (USD 6,089,815.06), updated to incorporate the final supplementary deposit of USD 27,500 paid by Claimant pursuant to the PCA\u2019s letter dated 18 January 2017.\n\n**(2) The Respondent**\n----------------------\n\n406.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is entitled to an award of all of the costs and expenses specified in the Respondent\u2019s Costs Schedule, on the basis of the principle that the \"costs follow the event\" in accordance with Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.665 The Respondent submits that the costs it incurred in this matter are reasonable, were necessitated by the manner in which the Claimant presented its claims, and are low in comparison to the reported average costs of investment disputes.666 The Respondent notes that it retained counsel based on a public procurement process based on the price offered.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 2-9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b610-12.\n\n407.\n\nOn 7 February 2017, the Respondent sought to increase its costs claims by a substantial amount referable to previously unclaimed costs. On 11 February 2017, the Tribunal refused to allow such costs upon the grounds of implied election to forego such late claims.\n\n408.\n\nConcerning the Claimant\u2019s costs, the Respondent submits that the costs claimed by the Claimant appear to be inflated, in large part are not reimbursable under the UNCITRAL Rules, and in certain cases have been incorrectly calculated.667\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 2-26.\n\n409.\n\nThe Respondent claims its aggregate total costs in the amounts of USD 452,500 and CZK 35,940,599.34.668\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, Annex 1 (USD 425,000 and CZK 35,940,599.34), updated to incorporate the final supplementary deposit of USD 27,500 paid by Respondent pursuant to the PCA\u2019s letter dated 18 January 2017.\n\n**2. Relevant Rules on costs**\n------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nIn the UNCITRAL Rules, provisions relevant to costs are found in Articles 38 to 40. Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules defines the \"costs of arbitration\" as follows:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\n\n411.\n\nAccording to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the allocation of costs is addressed differently as to Tribunal costs on the one hand (paragraphs (a) to (d), and (f) of Article 38) and the parties\u2019 own costs of representation and assistance on the other hand (paragraph (e) of Article 38). Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n**3. Fixing the costs of the arbitration**\n------------------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nThe Parties deposited with the PCA a total of USD 905,000 (USD 452,500 by the Claimant; USD 452,500 by the Respondent) to cover the costs of arbitration.\n\n413.\n\nThe fees of Professor Robert Volterra, the arbitrator appointed by the Claimants, amount to USD 207,390.00. His expenses amount to USD 7,850.03. The fees of Judge James Crawford, the arbitrator appointed by the Respondent, amount to USD 201,316.25. The fees of Dr Gavan Griffith, the presiding arbitrator, amount to USD 312,322.50. His expenses amount to USD 6,020.55.\n\n414.\n\nPursuant to the Terms of Appointment and the agreement of the Parties, the International Bureau of the PCA was designated to act as Registry in this arbitration. The PCA\u2019s fees for registry services amount to USD 82,388.86. Other tribunal costs, including court reporters, hearing rooms, meeting facilities, travel, bank charges, and all other expenses relating to the arbitration proceedings, amount to USD 87,711.81.\n\n415.\n\nBased on the above figures, the combined Tribunal costs, comprising the items covered in Article 3 8 (a), (b) and (c) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as enumerated above, are fixed at a total of USD 905,000.00. These costs are deducted from the deposit, with no unexpended balance to be returned to the Parties.\n\n416.\n\nFinally, under Article 38(e), the Tribunal finds the costs claimed by the successful party, the Respondent, to be reasonable in amount and proportionate to the nature and complexity of the matter. For the purposes of Article 38(e), the Tribunal therefore fixes Respondent\u2019s legal and other costs of representation at CZK 35,595,254.34 (comprising CZK 27,824,759.32 for its legal fees and CZK 7,770,495.02 for its expert\u2019s fees).\n\n**4. Allocating the costs of arbitration**\n------------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nWith respect to the tribunal costs, the Tribunal applies the general principle of \"costs follow the event.\" That approach is the more compelling here given that the UNCITRAL Rules expressly contemplate the rule of \"costs follow the event\" in Article 40(1) by its emphasis on \"success\" or its opposite. This conclusion is bolstered by both Parties\u2019 choice to argue that the unsuccessful side in this arbitration bear the full amount of tribunal costs as well as the successful Party\u2019s costs of legal representation.\n\n418.\n\nWhile the Tribunal retains discretion to apportion the tribunal costs between the Parties if it determines that such apportionment is \"reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case\", it is not persuaded that such circumstances exist in the present case. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines, pursuant to Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, that it is reasonable to apportion the costs of the arbitration between the Parties such that the Claimant shall bear the full costs of the Tribunal.\n\n419.\n\nWith respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in Article 38, paragraph (e), the Tribunal notes that there is no equivalent presumption in Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules that the unsuccessful party shall bear such costs. The Tribunal is \"free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\"\n\n420.\n\nAs to the costs for legal representation, as defined under Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules, although the Tribunal considers that each Party\u2019s conduct during the course of proceedings was reasonable, efficient and professional, it remains that the Claimant was entirely unsuccessful in result, in the context that many of the factual issues already had been litigated to finality in curial proceeding.\n\n421.\n\nEach Party\u2019s Costs Submissions were predicated upon costs awards to follow the event, and neither proposed in advance the not uncommon costs orders made in investment disputes that no costs orders be made.\n\n422.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal that in all the circumstances it is appropriate for its costs determinations to reflect the Parties\u2019 common positions as to the appropriate basis for professional costs and other expenses to be ordered by reference to the result. On this approach, no occasion arises for analysis of the net result on the many separate issues, as their disposition was entirely one way to the Respondent. Hence, in the terms of Article 40(2), set out above, the Tribunal does not regard it as appropriate to any portion of the Respondent\u2019s actual costs not to be reimbursed by the Claimant.\n\n*Quantum*\n---------\n\n423.\n\nAs to quantum, *ex facie* the separate claims by the Respondent for actual costs and expenses comprising -\n\n**Expert fees and expenses** CZK 7,770,495.02\n\n**Compensation for Witnesses** CZK 345,345.00\n\n**Counsel Fees:** CZK 25,217,815.70\n\n**Counsel Expenses:** CZK 2,037,355.69\n\n**Translations** CZK 443,356.10\n\n**Travel and Other Expenses of Representatives** CZK 126,231.83\n\nobjectively appear reasonable in subject matter and amount having regard to the course of this contested dispute, as is confirmed by the extensive summaries of facts and argumentation and determination of issues in the course of this dispute. The fact that the similar professional costs and expenses sought by the Claimant are a multiple of the actual costs of the Respondent is not separately determinative of reasonableness, nonetheless they may be referred to as confirmatory of this factor.\n\n424.\n\nIt follows that the costs decisions of the Tribunal is that the Claimant should bear the entire costs of the dispute by reimbursing to the Respondent for its net arbitration costs advanced of **USD 452,500** and also to pay the Respondent\u2019s professional and other costs and expenses to the total amount of **CZK 35,940,599.34.**\n\n**VIII. AWARD**\n---------------\n\n**For the reasons stated -**\n\n**1. IT IS DECLARED THAT -**\n\n**(1) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the alleged breaches of the BIT other than arising under Article 5; and**\n\n**(2) The Respondent has not breached the BIT.**\n\n**2. The Claims herein are wholly dismissed.**\n\n**3. The Claimant is ordered to pay to the Respondent:**\n\n**(1) USD 452,500.00 to recoup the Respondent\u2019s share of the costs of the arbitration; and**\n\n**(2) CZK 35,940,599.34. for the Respondent\u2019s costs and expenses.**"}]}
