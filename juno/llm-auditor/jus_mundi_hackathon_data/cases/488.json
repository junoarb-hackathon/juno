Commencement of the Arbitration Proceedings and Constitution of theArbitral Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 8 May 2009, Claimant served a Notice of Arbitration on Respondent alleging breaches of the Treaty between The United States of America and The Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the \"BIT\").\n\n2.\n\nBy letter dated 31 July 2009 and pursuant to Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (the \"UNCITRAL Rules\"), Claimant informed Respondent of its appointment of Professor Michael Pryles as the first Arbitrator.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated 1 October 2009 and pursuant to Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Rules, Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern as the second Arbitrator.\n\n4.\n\nOn 30 October 2009, the Co-arbitrators agreed on the choice of Professor Piero Bernardini as Presiding Arbitrator.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter dated 3 November 2009, the Presiding Arbitrator informed the Parties that the Tribunal had been duly constituted and invited Respondent to submit its Answer to Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration by 23 November 2009.\n\n6.\n\nOn 23 November 2009, Respondent submitted its Answer to Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s direction.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 25 November 2009, the Tribunal noted the Parties\u2019 agreement to retain the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"PCA\") as administrator of the proceedings and concurred with this agreement.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 27 November 2009, the Tribunal sent to the Parties draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules for their review and comment by 18 December 2009, and invited the Parties to agree on a calendar for the proceedings by the same date.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 9 December 2009, the Tribunal confirmed that the initial hearing would be held at the Peace Palace, in The Hague, on 15 January 2010, as agreed upon by Respondent and Claimant in their letters of 4 and 7 December 2009, respectively. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that the PCA had appointed Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu as the administrative secretary for the case and invited them to confirm that they agreed to the appointment by 18 December 2009.\n\n10.\n\nBy separate letters dated 18 December 2009, Claimant and Respondent successively informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been unable to agree on a procedural calendar, indicated their respective position on said calendar, and provided their comments on the draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules circulated by the Tribunal. Respondent also confirmed in its letter its acceptance of the terms by which Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu would serve as administrative secretary to the Tribunal. Claimant did so in a subsequent letter dated 21 December 2009.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated 23 December 2009, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, circulated updated draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules in anticipation of the initial hearing.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 12 January 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties that, due to bad weather conditions in Europe and additional professional commitments, Mr. Pryles would be unable to attend the initial hearing in person on 15 January 2010, but would attend by video conference.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 13 January 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, circulated further updated draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules in anticipation of the initial hearing.\n\n**B. Initial Hearing**\n----------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 15 January 2010, an initial hearing was held at the Peace Palace, in The Hague, The Netherlands.

The Presiding Arbitrator signed the Procedural Rules on behalf of the Tribunal. Signed originals of each document were handed out to each Party and member of the Tribunal. Having heard the arguments of the Parties with respect to the case, the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the proceedings and established the procedural calendar.1\n\nSee summary minutes of the initial hearing dated 20 January 2010, p. 10.\n\n**C. Written Phase of the Proceedings**\n---------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated 20 January 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, circulated the summary minutes of the initial hearing that took place on 15 January 2010, along with an audio-CD containing the recording of the initial hearing. The PCA invited the Parties to submit their comments on these summary minutes by 27 January 2010. The PCA also circulated on behalf of the Tribunal Procedural Order No. 1 dated 20 January 2010, which set out the procedural calendar established at the initial hearing.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter dated 20 January 2010, Claimant noted a disparity between Procedural Order No. 1 and the summary minutes of the initial hearing with respect to the date by which the first round of document productions should be made, and asked the Tribunal for clarification. By letter of the same date, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties that the correct date was 29 January 2010, not 27 January 2010, and circulated a duly amended Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 22 January 2010 and in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Claimant submitted its First Request for the Production of Documents.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated 22 January 2010 and in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Respondent submitted its Request for Production of Documents in the form of a Redfern Schedule.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated 25 January 2010, Claimant submitted a Redfern Schedule relating to Claimant\u2019s document requests.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter dated 29 January 2010, Claimant submitted its responses and objections to Respondent\u2019s Request for Production of Documents dated 22 January 2010 in the form of a Redfern Schedule, along with a document entitled Responses and Objections.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated 29 January 2010, Respondent submitted, in the form of a Redfern Schedule, its responses to Claimant\u2019s First Request for the Production of Documents dated 22 January 2010, as well as an index of the documents it produced.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated 4 February 2010, Claimant submitted to the Tribunal its Replies to Respondent\u2019s Response to Claimant\u2019s Request for Document Production.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter dated 5 February 2010, Respondent submitted its updated Redfern Schedule, and its Responses to Claimant\u2019s Objections to Respondent\u2019s Request for Production of Documents.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter dated 5 February 2010, Claimant submitted a confidential structure chart identifying the abbreviated ownership structure of Ulysseas.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter dated 8 February 2010, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was unable to limit or abandon its request for production of documents, as Claimant had expected in light of its submission of a structure chart identifying its abbreviated ownership structure.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter dated 10 February 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal and in accordance with the schedule established in Procedural Order No. 1, circulated Procedural Order No. 2 which recorded the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Parties\u2019 Requests for Document Production. Procedural Order No. 2 provided, *inter alia,* that Claimant had to produce certain documents in response to Respondent\u2019s Request No. 4, provided that the Parties entered into a confidentiality agreement regarding these documents.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter dated 19 February 2010, Respondent drew to the Tribunal\u2019s attention that Claimant was refusing to accept certain provisions of Respondent\u2019s executed agreement on confidentiality, and on that basis was refusing to produce the documents responsive to Respondent\u2019s Request No. 4 until a confidentiality agreement has been reached. Respondent requested the Tribunal to direct the Parties as follows:\n\n*A. to confirm that the Claimant\u2019s refusal to accept the terms of the Respondent\u2019s already executed agreement on confidentiality is unreasonable;*\n\n*B. to confirm that the Respondent has executed and delivered an agreement on confidentiality that is sufficient for the Claimant to produce the documents responsive to the Respondent\u2019s request No. 4, as required by Procedural Order No. 2;*\n\n*C. to instruct the Claimant to produce such documents forthwith and within 24 hours of the Tribunal so directing;*\n\n*D. to amend the procedural schedule to take account of the Claimant\u2019s delay in producing documents in accordance with Procedural Orders No. 1 and No. 2, so that the time period for submitting Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction extends to one month from the date on which the Claimant produces the requested documentation; and*\n\n*E. to draw the appropriate inferences from the Claimant\u2019s refusal to accept the Respondent\u2019s executed confidentiality agreement.*\n\n29.\n\nAfter further correspondence between the Parties on this issue, the PCA, by letter dated 23 February 2010 and under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties that the Tribunal had examined the Parties\u2019 exchange of correspondence relating to the Confidentiality Agreement and invited the Parties to reconcile their positions without delay so as not to disrupt the agreed calendar of the proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nFollowing a further exchange of correspondence between the Parties regarding Claimant\u2019s document production, and a letter from Claimant dated 24 February 2010 informing the Tribunal that the issue regarding the conclusion of the confidentiality agreement should be resolved without the need for intervention by the Tribunal, the Parties entered into a Confidentiality Agreement on 26 February 2010.2\n\nLetter from Claimant to Respondent dated 9 March 2010, p. 5.\n\n31.\n\nIn subsequent correspondence exchanged by the Parties on 5, 9, and 16 March 2010, the Parties further discussed Claimant\u2019s document production and compliance with Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter dated 19 March 2010, Respondent submitted its Memorial on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction with Fact Exhibits and Fegal Authorities in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter dated 19 April 2010, Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, with supporting Witness Statements, Fact Exhibits and Fegal Authorities in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter dated 10 May 2010, Respondent submitted its Reply with Legal Authorities in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter dated 12 May 2010 and following confirmation by Respondent of its availability, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, confirmed that the hearing on jurisdiction would be held on 17-18 June 2010 in The Hague in the Peace Palace and invited the Parties to agree on a hearing schedule by 7 June 2010.\n\n36.\n\nBy letter dated 20 May 2010, Claimant informed Respondent that \"Elliott Associates, L.P. is willing to provide documents further supporting Mr. Veldwijk\u2019s statement regarding Paul Singer\u2019s control over the other two general partners in Elliott Associates, F.P.\" on the condition that \"the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between Ulysseas and the Republic of Ecuador dated February 25, 2010 are extended to include Elliott and any document produced by Elliott, and any such documents are treated as \u2018Confidential Material\u2019 pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.\" Claimant also enclosed a letter to this effect from Elliott Associates, L.P.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter dated 25 May 2010, Respondent replied to Claimant\u2019s letter dated 20 May 2010 stating that Claimant did not comply with Procedural Order No. 2 in a timely fashion and \"may not do so now at this late stage.\"\n\n38.\n\nBy letter dated 31 May 2010, Claimant submitted its Rejoinder with Legal Authorities in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter dated 7 June 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties of the Tribunal\u2019s following directions:\n\n*1. In application of Section 3.3 of the Procedural Rules of January 15, 2010, Claimant shall produce the documents indicated in its letter of May 20, 2010 regarding Paul Singer\u2019s control over the other two general partners in Elliott Associates L.P. This evidence, which is directly relevant to the question of jurisdiction to be decided by the Tribunal, is not covered by Procedural Order No. 2.*\n\n*2. Claimant's request that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with Respondent dated February 25, 2010 be extended to cover the documents to be so produced is justified in light of Elliott Associates\u2019 counsel\u2019s letter of May 20,* *2010. Respondent is therefore invited to agree to such extension.*\n\n*3. These additional documents shall be produced not later that June 14, 2010. Respondent shall have an opportunity to comment on such documents either in writing soon thereafter or in the course of its oral submission at the hearing.*\n\n*4. On a different matter, Claimant is invited to have available at the hearing the unredacted text of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) dated January 18, 2002 (C-JURI-42) and of the Amended JVA dated June 29, 2007 (C-JURI-44), should the Tribunal decide to inspect them.*\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal having granted a one-day extension to the Parties, at their request, for the submission of a hearing schedule, Claimant, on behalf of the Parties, informed the Tribunal of the agreed schedule by letter dated 8 June 2010. The schedule indicated, *inter alia,* that Mr. Zacharia Korn, one of Claimant\u2019s witnesses, would testify before the Tribunal.\n\n41.\n\nBy letter dated 10 June 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties that the proposed hearing schedule was agreeable to the Tribunal.\n\n42.\n\nBy e-mail dated 15 June 2010, Claimant submitted electronic copies of the documents that it was requested to submit pursuant to paragraph 1 of the PCA\u2019s letter dated 7 June 2010, and informed the PCA that hard copies of the documents had previously been provided to Respondent under cover of the Parties\u2019 Confidentiality Agreement. By letter of the same date, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal and in accordance with paragraph 3 of the PCA\u2019s letter dated 7 June 2010, informed the Parties that Respondent was invited to submit its comments on the above-mentioned documents at the upcoming hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n43.\n\nBy letter dated 15 June 2010, Respondent submitted English translations of certain Fact Exhibits and Legal Authorities.\n\n**D.

Events Leading To These Proceedings**\n------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe views of the Parties concerning how the present dispute developed diverge considerably. For purposes of the present decision, suffice it to note that, in Claimant\u2019s view, Respondent took several measures which altered the legal and regulatory framework governing the power sector in Ecuador, including the payment system applicable to private thermoelectric generators like Ulysseas,76 and ultimately left Claimant\u2019s investment devoid of value.77 According to Claimant, Ecuador\u2019s actions amount to a violation of its right under the BIT to fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, and protection against unlawful expropriation.78\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 3.20 *et seq.*\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 3.38.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 4.2.\n\n74.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, PBI, which only operated from April to October 2006, was unfit for its purpose due to technical defects.79 On 18 February 2008, Claimant requested that the PBI Licence Contract be terminated by mutual agreement of the Parties80 and subsequently informed CONELEC that PBI would be recycled.81 Respondent also argues that Claimant failed to fulfill its obligations under the PBII Licence Contract,82 and eventually left no choice to CONELEC but to assume temporary operation of PBII.83 Respondent believes that Ulysseas\u2019 claims fall outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.84\n\nMemorial, paras. 22-23.\n\nMemorial, para. 23; Letter from Ulysseas to CONELEC, dated 18 January 2008, Exhibit R-ll.\n\nMemorial, para. 23; Letter from Ulysseas to CONELEC, dated 19 May 2008, Exhibit R-12.\n\nMemorial, para. 25; Letter from Ulysseas to CONELEC, dated 21 December 2007, section A.I., Exhibit R-35.\n\nMemorial, para. 27; CONELEC Resolution No. 089/09, dated 24 September 2009, Exhibit R-20.\n\nAnswer, para. 57; Memorial, para. 165; Reply, para. 89.\n\n**CHAPTER III - CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nRespondent alleges that Claimant has waived its right to bring claims against Respondent under the BIT with respect to its investment in Ecuador, and even if Claimant is held not to have waived arbitration against Respondent under the BIT, Respondent has denied Claimant the advantages of the BIT in accordance with its Article 1(2).85\n\nMemorial, paras. 4, 5, 10.\n\n76.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent\u2019s objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction are groundless.86 Respondent\u2019s argument based on waiver \"fail[s] to overcome the strong presumption against a claimant\u2019s contractual waiver of treaty rights granted under the BIT\" and the alleged waiver does not apply to Ulysseas\u2019 treaty claims.87 In addition, the provisions of Article 1(2) of the BIT, which Respondent incorrectly interprets, do not apply in this case.88\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 5-20.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 16.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 17, 74.\n\n**A.

See also Rejoinder, para. 8.\n\n84.\n\nMore generally, with respect to the cases of *SGS* v. *Pakistan, IBM v. Ecuador, Vivendi v. Argentina* and *Azurix* v. *Argentina,* Claimant is of the view that Respondent, in its interpretation of the cases, relies upon a false dichotomy between contractual renunciation of other available jurisdictions, and a contractual exclusive forum selection clause, a dichotomy which the tribunals in those cases was not faced with.116\n\nRejoinder, paras. 13.15, 16.\n\n85.\n\nClaimant further asserts that treaty-based fork-in-the-road clauses and Calvo clause awards cannot be relied upon to buttress the applicability of contractual waiver on the following grounds: first, fork-in-the-road provisions are set out in the applicable BIT and do not depend on contractual provisions;117 they are also different from an advance waiver in so far as they offer a choice to the investor at the time the dispute is submitted for resolution;118 second, the *North American Dredging Company of Texas* and *Woodruff* cases deal with the ability of a party to waive an international tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over contract claims and therefore are not relevant to the present claim for breach of the BIT.119\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 43.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 86, lines 21-25, p. 87, line 1.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 45.\n\n86.\n\nFinally, Claimant submits that to deprive investors of the neutral international forum provided for under BITs would ultimately discourage foreign investment and contradict the public interest.120 Indeed, Respondent cannot ignore that \"[...] contractual waiver of BIT rights is prohibited because it would allow State parties to give lip service to their international commitments, while undermining those commitments by a contract.\"121\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 42.\n\nRejoinder, para. 6.\n\n**2. The alleged waiver in Article 30 of the Licence Contracts of Claimant\u2019s right to resort to arbitration under the BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) The express and clear waiver allegedly contained in Article 30 of the Licence Contracts\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Respondent\u2019s contentions*\n------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nRespondent contends that Article 30 of the Licence Contracts contains a clear and unambiguous waiver of recourse to international arbitration under the BIT.122 First, the negotiating history of the Licence Contracts demonstrates that while Claimant was not required to waive this right under Ecuadorian law, Claimant nonetheless agreed to do so freely.123 Second, Respondent is of the view that the use of the phrase \"the express waiver of any other national or international jurisdiction [...], public or private\" in Article 30 clearly encompasses all dispute resolution procedures available to the Parties.124 Contrary to Claimant\u2019s argument, the reference to \"international jurisdiction\" can only mean that the Parties intended to waive recourse to international BIT arbitration, given it is the only obvious instance of international jurisdiction available to Claimant in this case.125\n\nMemorial, paras. 35, 36; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 14; lines 24-25.\n\nMemorial, paras. 37-42.

Respondent adds that, contrary to Claimant\u2019s contention, Ecuador\u2019s foreign investment law does not confer jurisdiction to international bodies and thus does not offer any alternative forum (Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 6, lines 19-25, p. 7, lines 1-6).\n\n88.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent contends that Claimant\u2019s reliance on *Occidental v. Ecuador* to argue that Article 30 does not contain a clear waiver, is misplaced.126 First, the contract in that case provided expressly for ICSID jurisdiction.127 Second, the issue was not whether waiver language generally excludes resort to arbitration under an investment treaty.128 Third, the scope of the contractual waiver in question was significantly narrower than that of Article 30.129\n\nReply, para. 20.

See also Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 10, lines 5-14.\n\n89.\n\nFinally, while Claimant wrongly argues that Respondent bases its jurisdictional objection on a mere arbitration or forum selection clause,130 Respondent emphasizes that it instead relies \"on the express waiver\" contained in Article 30.131 Instead of focusing on the selection of forum made in Article 30, Claimant should address the effect of the express waiver contained in that provision, which it does not.132\n\nReply, para. 12. Respondent refers to Counter-Memorial, para. 15.\n\nReply, para. 12.\n\nReply, para. 13.\n\n*(ii) Claimant\u2019s contentions*\n-----------------------------\n\n90.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, Article 30 is insufficiently specific for it is not an exclusive forum selection clause that explicitly and clearly renounces the jurisdiction of tribunals constituted under the BIT.133 Rather, it refers only to \"any other public or private [...] international jurisdiction\" without mentioning the BIT or tribunals constituted under the BIT.134 While Respondent incorrectly argues that \"public [...] international jurisdiction\" can only refer in this case to arbitration under the BIT,135 Claimant contends that there are at least three counterexamples of public international fora for disproving Respondent\u2019s point.136\n\nCounter-Memorial, section 1, p. 26; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 89-93.

Claimant argues that (1) in the absence of Article 30, Ulysseas, CONELEC and Ecuador could have agreed to have this Tribunal hear both Ulysseas\u2019 BIT claims and contractual claims arising out of CONELEC\u2019s breach of the Licence Agreements; (2) if there were an umbrella clause, such as at Article II(3)(C) of the BIT, the Tribunal could deal with contract claims; and (3) at the time the Licence Agreements were signed, Ecuador\u2019s Investment Promotion and Guarantee Law of 1997 offered various international fora to foreign investors.\n\n91.\n\nClaimant also relies, *inter alia,* on *Occidental v. Ecuador,137* concerning a clause in the parties\u2019 Participation Contract that is similar to, and even broader than,138 Article 30, which the tribunal held to be insufficiently clear and unequivocal to amount to a waiver.139\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 52, 53. Claimant refers to *Occidental v. Ecuador,* Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 63, 71, 73, 74 Exhibit C-JURI-H.

Claimant refers to *Occidental v. Ecuador,* Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 71, 73, 74, Exhibit C-JURI-H. See also Rejoinder, para. 44.\n\n92.\n\nFinally, Claimant submits that Article 30 consists of a *positive* agreement to arbitrate in Quito, which must be balanced by a *negative* renunciation of jurisdiction.140 Whereas Respondent seeks to separate the negative renunciation of jurisdiction from Article 30, Claimant submits that they go hand in hand.141\n\nRejoinder, para. 13.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 13.15; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 94, lines 10-21.\n\n(b) The alleged identity of the Parties to the Licence Contracts and to this arbitration\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Respondent\u2019s contentions*\n------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nRespondent asserts that CONELEC acted \"in representation of the Ecuadorian State\" - as explicitly stated in the Licence Contracts - thereby making Respondent a party to the Licence Contracts.142 While Claimant relies on Article 2 of the *Ley de R\u00e9gimen del Sector El\u00e9ctrico* (\"LRSE\") for the proposition that CONELEC is a separate entity independent of the Ecuadorian State, Respondent asserts that the wording of Article 2 \"does not render the State *(i.e.,* the Respondent) a third party to the Licence Contracts.\"143 Other provisions of the Licence Contracts, in Respondent\u2019s view, indicate that Claimant contracted with Respondent.144 In particular, Respondent refers to Article 23, which concerns changes in legislation affecting the autonomy of the Grantor that Respondent only could introduce,145 and to Article 24, a stabilization clause providing that \"the State\" shall acknowledge damage to \"the investor\" if laws or regulations cause injury or amend contractual provisions.146 Moreover, \"[i]f the parties truly intended for CONELEC to act as a separate and independent entity from the Respondent, any change in legislation would have constituted a *force majeure* event and not a breach of the Grantor\u2019s obligations.\"147 That is not the purpose of Article 25 of the Licence Contracts and its reference to \"authorities exercising public office\" does not relate to Ecuadorian public authorities.148\n\nReply, paras. 9, 21-31.

Argentina, Aguas del Tunari* v. *Bolivia,* and *Impregilo* v. *Pakistan* to support its arguments that tribunals have held that arbitration clauses in concession contracts signed with government agencies or entities, as is CONELEC, do not waive treaty-based claims against the Government.163\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 28.

In Claimant\u2019s view, if Respondent were bound, acts by Respondent would not be \"unforeseeable events,\" including \"acts of the authority exercised by a public official,\" which do include acts of Ecuadorian public authorities (Rejoinder, para. 28). Claimant refers to **Contrato de Permiso Para Generaci\u00f3n de Energ\u00eda** regarding PBI, dated 15 August 2005, Art. 25, Exhibit C-JURI-38; **Contrato de Permiso Para Generaci\u00f3n de Energ\u00eda** regarding PBII, dated 12 September 2006, Art. 25, Exhibit C-JURI-40.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 57, 58, 62.

On the basis that Respondent is a party to the Licence Contracts, Respondent also contends that the words \"controversies or differences\" in Article 30 must have been intended to include all claims that could arise against a State, *e.g.* treaty claims (Reply, para. 34).\n\n100.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"the mere fact that the waiver is contained in a contract does not mean that it is limited in scope to only contractual claims.\"177 In fact, Claimant implicitly accepts Respondent\u2019s position when it recognizes that BIT-based arbitration may be waived provided that the waiver is sufficiently specific. Referring to *Eureko* v. *Poland,* Respondent takes the example of a settlement agreement between the State and the investor which had the effect of waiving both the contractual and treaty claims of the investor.178 Seen in its proper context, Article 30 is specific enough to encompass \"the entire relationship between Ulysseas and the Republic of Ecuador as the state granting the concession for the operation of the power barges.\"179\n\nReply, para. 33; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 16, lines 22-23. In Respondent\u2019s view, both *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia* and *Occidental v.

Poland* is misplaced, given that it dealt with the post-dispute settlement of claims that were already known to the parties to the settlement agreement, whereas Respondent argues that Claimant waived treaty claims *before* any claims arose.197\n\nRejoinder, para. 49.

Claimant argues that permission to operate the Barges in Ecuador was granted by CONELEC through Certificates issued on 12 April 2005 and 11 September 2006 separately from the Licence Contracts and neither contained an arbitration clause; in any case, the Barges arrived in Ecuador before these Certificates were issued on 31 March 2003 and 16 April 2005 respectively.\n\n106.\n\nClaimant further submits that the guarantees contained in the Licence Contracts find no parallels in the BIT, and are \"subject to Ecuadorian law\" as set out in Article 30.204 Therefore the waiver can apply only to matters of Ecuadorian law. Claimant has not, however, made Ecuadorian contract law claims for breach of the Licence Contracts; its claims are based on the BIT.205\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 66.

Interpretation of the terms of Article 1(2) of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent\u2019s contentions\n----------------------------\n\n107.\n\nRespondent contends that it was clearly entitled to, and did apply, the plain terms of the BIT to deny its advantages to Claimant.206 Indeed, under Article 1(2) of the BIT, each Party to the Treaty reserves the right to deny the advantages (a) to \"any company,\" in which case the only applicable condition is that \"nationals of a third country control such company,\" and (b) to \"a company of the other Party,\" in which case one of two additional conditions must be met:\n\n(i) either that company of the other Party \"has no substantial business activities in the territory of the other Party\"; or\n\n(ii) that company \"is controlled by nationals of a third country with which the denying Party does not maintain normal economic relations.\"207\n\nMemorial, paras. 93, 95.\n\nMemorial, para. 97.\n\n108.\n\nRespondent contends that the meaning of \"control\" in a legal context \"includes the legal capacity or entitlement to control another entity.\"208 Respondent further argues that \"control\" for the purposes of Article 1(2) of the BIT should be distinguished from ownership or an ownership interest209 and may be based on a \"contractual relationship,\"210 including the fact of being a general partner.211 Respondent asserts that United States investment treaty practice confirms this position.212 Further, in Respondent\u2019s view, \"control may be held or exercised directly or indirectly\" such as through intermediary entities;213 \"control may be either *de jure* or *defacto,\" i.e.* amounting to \"the legal potential or ability to exercise substantial influence over the management and operations of the Claimant\";214 \"control may be held or exercised exclusively or jointly with others,\"215 including through a joint venture agreement;216 and control must be established \"immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute\"217 as is the case for Article VI(8) of the BIT, for Claimant to qualify as a company of the United States. By restricting the meaning of control to \"direct ownership,\" Claimant fails to interpret the terms of the BIT in accordance with the VCLT.218\n\nMemorial, para. 99.

Respondent refers to Articles I(l)(a), (b), (f), VI(8) of the BIT, Exhibit R-A and points out that all other relevant provisions of the BIT, except Article I(l)(e), use the phrase \"owned and controlled,\" and not merely \"control\" as is the case in Article 1(2). Respondent also refers to *Aguas del Tunari* for the proposition that control is not limited to ownership (See Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 49, lines 21-25, p. 50, lines 1-6; *Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v.

Respondent refers to the VCLT, Exhibit R-P.\n\n109.\n\nRespondent further argues that the reference to \"nationals of a third country\" in Article 1(2) of the BIT is concerned only with natural persons and not companies.219 Respondent notes, in support of its position, that Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT defines a \"national\" as \"a natural person,\" that Article 1(2) must be contrasted with provisions that refer to both \"nationals *and* companies,\"220 and that this interpretation is the only way of reconciling Article 1(2) with Article VI(8), which refers to \"nationals *or* companies.\"221 In addition, Respondent refers to the Letter of Submittal of the BIT, asserting that denial of the benefits of the BIT was reserved for parent companies *\"ultimately* owned by non-Party nationals.\"222\n\nMemorial, para. 109; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 56-58.\n\nMemorial, para. 110.

While Respondent argues that Claimant has not provided sufficient evidence of substantial business activities, Claimant points out that Respondent has chosen not to cross-examine Messrs Veldwijk and Pollock on this issue (Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 61, lines 2-14).\n\n**4. The question of the timeliness of Respondent\u2019s denial of the advantages of the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent\u2019s contentions\n----------------------------\n\n124.\n\nRespondent submits that it denied to Claimant the advantages of the BIT in a timely fashion on two grounds:279 first, Article 1(2) of the BIT reserves a right for each party to deny the advantages of the BIT, which is not qualified by any time limit, and the existence of which should be determined on a case-by-case basis;280 second, Claimant knew of Respondent\u2019s expectation to deny the advantages of the BIT from the outset, Claimant having waived recourse to arbitration under Article 30 of the Licence Contracts.281\n\nMemorial, para. 163.\n\nMemorial, para. 161.\n\nMemorial, para. 162.\n\n125.\n\nFurther, contrary to Claimant\u2019s argument that this right must have been exercised before commencement of these proceedings,282 Respondent argues that that position \"is not supported by either the text of the BIT or notions of *\u2018legal certainty'.\"283* Claimant\u2019s reliance on authorities interpreting Article 17(1) of the ECT is inappropriate: (1) neither Respondent nor the United States are parties to the ECT; (2) unlike Article 1(2) of the BIT, Article 17(1) of the ECT concerns the denial of the substantive benefits of the ECT only, as opposed to the advantages of the entire treaty.284\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 87.\n\nReply, paras. 40, 44-46; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 45, lines 16-17.\n\nReply, para. 44; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 41-43. According to Respondent, Claimant\u2019s other authorities are not on point (see Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 44, lines 9-18).\n\n126.\n\nRespondent instead relies on *Empresa El\u00e9ctrica v. Ecuador* where the State exercised its right to deny advantages at the first session of the tribunal which then held that Ecuador had exercised its right in a timely fashion.285 While general principles of international law may well impose a time limit on the exercise of the right to deny the advantages of the BIT, Respondent has acted reasonably by invoking the denial of advantages as a preliminary objection to jurisdiction.286 Finally, according to Respondent, it would not be feasible in practice to ask host States to monitor all investors to check whether they are controlled by third party nationals at the time they invest, as suggested by Claimant.287\n\nMemorial, para. 121; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 45, lines 2-9.

Compliance with Procedural Order No. 2**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Respondent\u2019s contentions\n----------------------------\n\n130.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant bears the burden of disproving the *prima facie* case that Respondent has made in this proceeding, namely that Mr. Efromovich, a third-country national, controls Claimant.296 Claimant has failed to discharge this burden.297 Indeed, Claimant did not comply with the requirements of Procedural Order No. 2 in at least four respects.298\n\nMemorial, paras. 128-129.\n\nMemorial, para. 130.\n\nMemorial, para. 130; Reply, para. 85.\n\n131.\n\nFirst, Respondent alleges that Claimant unilaterally redacted the JVA and the Amendment to JVA contrary to Procedural Order No. 2,299 and belatedly raised grounds of confidentiality for such redaction.300 This and the fact that Claimant obtained the JVA from Proteus301 suggest that \"Claimant is an instrument of the joint venture between the Elliott Group and Synergy Group.\"302 Respondent finally objected to Claimant\u2019s proposed *in camera* and *ex parte* inspection of the JVA by the Tribunal.303\n\nMemorial, para. 134.\n\nMemorial, para. 134; Reply, para. 86.\n\nMemorial, para. 136.\n\nMemorial, para. 133\n\nReply, para. 86.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n145.\n\nAs reflected by the Parties\u2019 contentions described in Chapter III, two are Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections. On one side, Respondent contends that in Article 30 of the Licence Contracts Claimant has waived its right to bring claims under the BIT (hereinafter, \"the alleged waiver of treaty claims\"). On the other, by exercising the right reserved to it by Article 1(2) of the BIT, Respondent has deprived Claimant of the advantages of the BIT, including its dispute settlement provision (hereinafter, \"the alleged denial of BIT\u2019s benefits\").\n\n146.\n\nThe Parties have argued extensively regarding both jurisdictional objections, as reflected by the summary of their respective contentions under Chapter III. Claimant requests the Tribunal to confirm that its claims are within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and are admissible. Respondent requests a decision that all of Claimant\u2019s claims are beyond the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or, in the alternative, are not admissible. Each Party requests that the other pay all costs associated with these proceedings.\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal will separately consider the alleged waiver of treaty claims and the alleged denial of BIT\u2019s benefits based on the Parties\u2019 arguments and the evidence filed by each of them in support of their respective contentions. The Tribunal\u2019s finding regarding the two jurisdictional objections concludes that Claimant\u2019s claims are within its jurisdiction for the reasons developed below in this Chapter.\n\n**B. The Alleged Waiver of Treaty Claims**\n------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Parties have discussed, among other questions, whether an investor may waive by contract its right to arbitration under a BIT.334 As made manifest by their opposing arguments, the heart of the Parties\u2019 debate lies in establishing whether an investor may choose to waive, in advance of any dispute which might arise in the future between that investor and the host State under the treaty, the treaty protection agreed between the contracting States. Obviously, an investor may freely waive to bring a treaty claim after a dispute has arisen, when all factual and legal aspects of the case are available permitting a considered choice whether or not to assert a claim in arbitration under the treaty.\n\n*Supra,* paras. 77-86.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the negative conclusion reached by other investment treaty tribunals regarding the investor\u2019s choice under a contract with the State of a dispute settlement method other than the one available to it under a given treaty, before any dispute has arisen. In view of its decision in the present case, the Tribunal does not need to express an opinion on the subject. It believes that in any case the investor\u2019s waiver of the treaty arbitration is subject to the essential condition that the waiver be freely agreed by the investor. Any pressure or compulsion by the host State to obtain by contract the investor\u2019s waiver of the treaty protection may well constitute a breach by the State of the obligation it has assumed vis-\u00e0-vis the other contracting State regarding the protection of that State\u2019s investor. There is no evidence in the file of these proceedings that Claimant\u2019s acceptance of Article 30 of the Licence Contracts, assuming it is a waiver of the BIT arbitration, was due to Respondent\u2019s compulsion or other form of pressure.\n\n150.\n\nThe question whether Claimant has waived its right to resort to arbitration under the BIT in Article 30 of the Licence Contracts deserves an in-depth analysis due to its multifaceted aspects.\n\nArticle 30 of the two Licence Contracts reads as follows in the original Spanish text:\n\n*SOLUCI\u00d3N DE CONTROVERSIAS - En caso de controversias o diferencias que surjan entre las partes y que no pudieran ser solucionadas entre las mismas, se sujetar\u00e1n a las leyes ecuatorianas y ser\u00e1n resueltas mediante el procedimiento alternativo de conciliaci\u00f3n y arbitraje, en derecho, y administrado con sujeci\u00f3n a la Ley de Mediaci\u00f3n y Arbitraje del Ecuador, de su Reglamento de Aplicaci\u00f3n y* *del Reglamento de los Tribunales de Arbitraje de la C\u00e1mara de Comercio de la ciudad de Quito, con expresa renuncia a cualquier otra jurisdicci\u00f3n nacional o internacional o la via diplom\u00e1tica, p\u00fablica o privada. Adicionalmente las partes contratantes convienen en que: La Autoridad nominadora del Tribunal conformado por tres \u00e1rbitros ser\u00e1 la C\u00e1mara de Comercio de Quito y, que el idioma a utilizarse en el procedimiento de conciliaci\u00f3n y arbitraje ser\u00e1 el castellano.335*\n\nRespondent\u2019s English translation of Article 30 of the Licence Contracts is reproduced *supra,* para. 72.\n\n151.\n\nIn order for the alleged contractual waiver by Claimant to be effective, the parties involved must be identical. The parties to the contracts which, according to Respondent, would have given effect to the waiver by Claimant of the BIT arbitration, *i.e.* the two Licence Contracts, should be Ulysseas, on one side, and the State of Ecuador, on the other. Only these two parties could have in fact waived a dispute settlement method available to them under the BIT by adopting the one regulated by Article 30 of the Licence Contracts. The Parties, fully aware of this indispensable condition, have strenuously argued this aspect, Claimant by denying that the State is a party to the Licence Contracts, and Respondent by contending that the State is a party to the Licence Contracts since CONELEC signed them *\"en representaci\u00f3n del Estado Ecuatoriano.\"336*\n\nThis formulation is in Article 1 of both Licence Contracts where the signatory parties are described as appearing *(\"Comparecientes\")* before the notary public in Quito on 15 August 2005 for PBI (Exhibits C-JURI-38 and R-9) and 12 September 2006 for PBII (Exhibits C-JURI-40 and R-5).\n\n152.\n\nIt is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the State of Ecuador is not party to the Licence Contracts, for the reasons that are given below.\n\n153.\n\nCONELEC, the National Electricity Council, was created by the LRSE \"as a legal entity subject to public law, with its own resources and administrative, economic, financial and operational autonomy.\"337 It is part of CONELEC\u2019s functions and powers, among others, \"to grant permits and licences for the installation of new power generation units and to give authority for the signature of concession contracts for the generation, transmission and distribution to the Executive Director of CONELEC in conformity with the applicable Regulation.\"338\n\n*Ley de R\u00e9gimen del Sector El\u00e9ctrico,* Art. 12: *\"Constituci\u00f3n. - Cr\u00e9ase el Consejo Nacional de la Electricidad CONELEC, como persona jur\u00eddica de derecho p\u00fablico con patrimonio propio, autonom\u00eda administrativa, econ\u00f3mica, financiera y operativa\"* (Exhibit C-JURI-K).\n\nLey *de R\u00e9gimen del Sector El\u00e9ctrico,* Art. 13 (n): *\"Otorgar permisos y licencias para la instalaci\u00f3n de nuevas unidades de generaci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda y autorizar la firma de contratos de concesi\u00f3n para generaci\u00f3n, transmisi\u00f3n o* *distribuci\u00f3n al Director Ejecutivo del CONELEC de conformidad a lo que se\u00f1ale el Reglamento respectivo\"* (Exhibit C-JURI-K) (the translation in the text is of the Tribunal). In conformity with Article 13 (n) of the LRSE, both Licence Contracts were signed by CONELEC\u2019s Executive Director.\n\n154.\n\nThe State of Ecuador has therefore created a special entity with separate legal personality, having its own assets and resources, capable of suing and being sued and entrusted with functions and powers to regulate the electricity sector on behalf of the State. The effect of creating a public entity to regulate a specific sector of State activity, with the power to sign contracts with third parties in that sector, is to avoid the direct responsibility of the State for that sector\u2019s activity. It would be contrary to this purpose to make the State party to contracts signed by the public entity with third parties, thereby assuming a direct responsibility towards those parties for the contract performance.\n\n155.\n\nTruly, Article 1 of the Licence Contracts, when describing the parties appearing before the notary public in Quito refers to CONELEC as being there *\"en representaci\u00f3n del Estado Ecuatoriano como as\u00ed lo determina el art\u00edculo dos de la Ley de R\u00e9gimen del Sector El\u00e9ctrico.* \"339 Respondent relies on this qualification of CONELEC to conclude that the State is the party to the Licence Contracts with Claimant. Article 2 of the Law in question, referred to in Article 1 of the Licence Contracts, states as follows:\n\n*Concesiones y Permisos. - El Estado es el titular de la propiedad inalienable e imprescriptible de los recursos naturales que permiten la generaci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica. Por tanto, s\u00f3lo \u00e9l, por intermedio del Consejo Nacional de Electricidad come ente p\u00fablico competente, puede concesionar o delegar a otros sectores de la econom\u00eda la generaci\u00f3n, transmisi\u00f3n, distribuci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n de la energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica.*\n\nReferring to this provision of the law in the context of the description of CONELEC as signatory to the Licence Contracts simply highlights that CONELEC is acting in the capacity and within the powers granted to it by the law in question *\"como ente publico competente.\"*\n\n*Contrato de Permiso Para Generaci\u00f3n de Energ\u00eda* regarding PBI, dated 15 August 2005, Art. 1, Exhibits C-JURI-38 and R-9 ; *Contrato de Permiso Para Generaci\u00f3n de Energ\u00eda* regarding PBII, dated 12 September 2006, Art. 1, Exhibits C-JURI-40 and R-5.\n\n156.\n\nLor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal adds that although CONELEC is an entity separate from the State, its conduct in performing the powers and duties assigned to it by the law may be attributed under public international law to the State in specific circumstances. Reference is made to Article 5 of the ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, providing as follows:\n\n*The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.*\n\nThe fact that the conduct of a person or entity may be attributed to the State in given circumstances confirms that the conduct is that of the person or entity, and not of the State. Were it the conduct of the State it would not need to be attributed to the State. This Article clearly states that only acts performed by a separate entity with the use of elements of governmental authority *(\"puissance publique\")* are attributed to the State, not acts performed in a commercial capacity, as are contracts.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that CONELEC, not the State of Ecuador, is party to the Licence Contracts is confirmed by various contractual provisions to which the Parties have made reference. When properly analysed, all these provisions make manifest that a clear distinction is made between CONELEC as party to the Licence Contracts and the State as the sovereign power whose actions, external to the contract, may have effects on the Parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations. Three provisions of the Licence Contracts will be considered in that regard.\n\n158.\n\nArticle 23 provides for CONELEC\u2019s responsibility, as Grantor *(\"OTORGANTE'),* to compensate the Licensee (in our case, Claimant) for any changes in legislation, regulation decision or other rule *(\"ley, regulaci\u00f3n, resoluci\u00f3n u otra norma\")* to the Licensee\u2019s prejudice. It is evident that any such changes may only be the result of State\u2019s acts.\n\n159.\n\nArticle 24 refers to Article 271 of the Constitution according to which the State, *\"a trav\u00e9s del OTORGANTE' (i.e.* CONELEC), may establish special guarantees and assurances in the investor\u2019s favour so that no modifications shall be made to the contracts *(\"los convenios\")* by laws or other provisions *\"de cualquier clase.\"* Should any law provisions result in prejudice to the investor or in the modification of the contractual provisions, compensation shall be paid to the investor for the resulting damage or prejudice, so as to reestablish the financial and economic stability that would have prevailed in the absence of such acts or decisions. Since compensation will be paid *\"a trav\u00e9s del OTORGANTE,\"* it is clear that the distinction between the State and CONELEC is again confirmed by this provision of the Licence Contracts.\n\n160.\n\nThe same distinction is also confirmed by Article 25, dealing with **force majeure** or fortuitous case *(\"Fuerza Mayor o Caso Fortuito\").* The list of events exempting either party from responsibility includes \"the acts of authority exercised by a public officer\" *(\"los actos de autoridad ejercidos por un funcionario p\u00fablico\").* There is no reason to restrict \"acts of authority\" to acts of non-Ecuadorian authorities, as suggested by Respondent.340 Therefore, since also the State of Ecuador\u2019s acts (through a public officer) may exempt CONELEC from responsibility for the duration of the *force majeure,* the State and CONELEC are clearly different entities, CONELEC being the party to the Licence Contracts which may experience a **force majeure** situation due to the State of Ecuador\u2019s acts.\n\nReply, para. 25. See also *supra,* para. 93.\n\n161.\n\nRespondent relies on Articles 3(c) and 5(a) of the *\"Ley Org\u00e1nica de la Procuraci\u00f3n General del Estado\"* of 13 April 2004,341 allowing the State, through the same authority by which it is represented in this arbitration, to initiate and defend arbitral proceedings involving public entities such as CONELEC.342 It appears from the analysis of these provisions of the *Ley Org\u00e1nica* that the functions of the *Procurador General del Estado* include supervising proceedings involving *\"entidades del sector p\u00fablico que tengan personer\u00eda jur\u00eddica\"* (Article 3(c): this is the case of CONELEC) and the filing of legal actions involving *\"las entidades u organismos del sector p\u00fablico\"* (Article 5(a): this, again, is the case of CONELEC). Under the same law, the **Procurador General del Estado** also has the function to *\"[e]jercer el patrocinio del Estado\"* (Article 3(a)), which confirms the distinction between the State and a public entity (such as CONELEC). The intervention in these proceedings of the **Procurador General del Estado** on Respondent\u2019s side is part of that authority\u2019s functions.\n\n*Ley Org\u00e1nica de la Procuraduria General del Estado, Codificaci\u00f3n,* published 13 April 2004, Exhibit R-RR.\n\nReply, para. 26. See also *supra,* para. 94.\n\n162.\n\nFor the reasons given above, this Tribunal concludes that there has been no waiver by Claimant of this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over its BIT claims against the State as a result of its acceptance of Article 30 of the Licence Contracts. CONELEC, not the State of Ecuador, is in fact party to such contracts. The agreement in Article 30 of the forum for disputes is an agreement between the Claimant and CONELEC, not between the Claimant and the Respondent State of Ecuador, and can only concern the contract claims of the Claimant against CONELEC. Accordingly, Claimant\u2019s BIT claims in these proceedings are within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.343\n\nIt is the Tribunal\u2019s view that this is an objection to jurisdiction and not an objection to admissibility, as sometimes referred to by the Parties.\n\n163.\n\nIn view of this conclusion, there is no need to analyse the content of Article 30 of the Licence Contracts, specifically whether, as discussed between the Parties, it covers the disputes and claims in this BIT arbitration.\n\n**C. The Alleged Denial of BIT\u2019S Benefits**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nIn its first written submission, Respondent has denied Claimant, under Article 1(2) of the BIT, the advantages of the BIT, both substantive and procedural, including the right to have recourse to arbitration before this Tribunal.344 Article 1(2) of the BIT provides as follows:\n\n*Each Party reserves the right to deny to any company the advantages of this Treaty if nationals of any third country control such company and, in the case of a company of the other Party, that company has no substantial business activities in the territory of the other Party or is controlled by nationals of a third country with which the denying Party does not maintain normal economic relations.345*\n\nAnswer, para. 16.\n\nBIT, Article 1(2), Claimant\u2019s Legal Authority 1 attached to the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n165.\n\nRespondent\u2019s denial of the advantages of the BIT was based on the circumstance that, in its view, available documentation indicates that Claimant is controlled by a national of a third country, namely Brazil or Bolivia,346 and that it has no business activities in the territory of the United States.347 As reflected by the part of Chapter III dealing with the Parties\u2019 contentions on this subject,348 the Parties disagree whether the conditions for the applicability of Article 1(2) of the BIT are satisfied in the instant case. Respondent contends that Claimant has not been able to rebut its objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the basis of Respondent\u2019s denial of the BIT\u2019S advantages to the Claimant.349 Claimant replies that Respondent has not discharged its burden of proving that such conditions have been met.350\n\nAnswer, para. 14. In subsequent submissions Respondent has made reference to Brazil only.\n\nAnswer, para. 11.\n\nSee *supra,* Chapter III, Section B.\n\nReply, para. 7.\n\nRejoinder, para. 53. See also *supra,* para. 136.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the burden of proving that the conditions for the exercise of the right to deny the BIT advantages is to be borne by Respondent as the party advancing this specific defence to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.351 This is the rule dictated by the UNCITRAL Rules governing these proceedings.352 To establish which conditions are to be proven for a denial of BIT advantages to be valid and effective requires interpreting Article 1(2) of the BIT in the light of the VCLT. Article 31(1) of the VCLT provides that\n\n*A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\nMemorial, para. 116; Rejoinder, para. 56.\n\nUNCITRAL Rules, Article 24(1): \"Each Party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support his claim or defence.\"\n\n167.\n\nApplying this rule of interpretation to the instant case, two cumulative conditions must be met for Respondent to deny Claimant the BIT advantages:\n\na) Claimant must be controlled by third party nationals, and\n\nb) either Claimant does not conduct substantial business activities in the United States or Claimant is controlled by nationals of a third country with which Respondent does not maintain normal economic relations.\n\n168.\n\nThe Parties agree that these are the relevant conditions under Article 1(2) of the BIT and that they must be met cumulatively.353 The Tribunal notes that if it is proven that Claimant is controlled by a United States national there will be no need to prove the other condition, the right to deny the BIT benefits being in such a case excluded. The Parties agree also that the term \"control\" means the \"legal capacity to control.\"354 However, they disagree regarding whether control must be exercised \"directly,\" as argued by Claimant,355 or may be exercised \"indirectly,\" as asserted by Respondent.356\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 92; Reply, para. 42.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 98; Reply, para. 56.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 102.\n\nReply, para. 56.\n\n169.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to determine whether the terms of Article 1(2) of the BIT, when read in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the treaty, are meant to limit \"control\" to direct control or also embrace indirect control. The Tribunal notes in that regard that Article 1(1) of the BIT defines a certain number of terms \"(f)or the purposes of this Treaty,\" *i.e.* with regard to any and all of the treaty provisions. Letter (c) of this Article defines \"national\" of a Party *(i.e.,* either the United States of America or the Republic of Ecuador) to mean \"a natural person who is a national of a Party under its applicable law.\"357\n\nBIT, Article 1(1), Claimant\u2019s Legal Authority 1 attached to the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n170.\n\nOnly natural persons may be at the upper end of the chain of control of a company, the last company in the chain having natural persons as shareholders or general partners. This means that in order to satisfy the control test under Article 1(2) of the BIT the natural person who is the ultimate controller of Ulysseas and its nationality must be identified.\n\n171.\n\nPrior to establishing whether the evidence in the file permits identification of the natural person ultimately controlling Claimant, the Tribunal will answer certain questions that have been raised by the Parties and which may bear on the validity and effect of Respondent\u2019s notice of denial of the BIT\u2019s advantages to Claimant.\n\n172.\n\nThe first question concerns whether there is a time-limit for the exercise by the State of the right to deny the BIT\u2019s advantages. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, since such advantages include BIT arbitration, a valid exercise of the right would have the effect of depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction under the BIT. According to the UNCITRAL Rules, a jurisdictional objection must be raised not later than in the statement of defence (Article 21(3)). By exercising the right to deny Claimant the BIT\u2019s advantages in the Answer,358 Respondent has complied with the time limit prescribed by the UNCITRAL Rules. Nothing in Article 1(2) of the BIT excludes that the right to deny the BIT\u2019s advantages be exercised by the State at the time when such advantages are sought by the investor through a request for arbitration.\n\n*Supra,* para. 164.\n\n173.\n\nA further question is whether the denial of advantages should apply only prospectively, as argued by Claimant, or may also have retrospective effects, as contended by Respondent. The Tribunal sees no valid reasons to exclude retrospective effects. In reply to Claimant\u2019s argument that this would cause uncertainties as to the legal relations under the BIT, it may be noted that since the possibility for the host State to exercise the right in question is known to the investor from the time when it made its the investment, it may be concluded that the protection afforded by the BIT is subject during the life of the investment to the possibility of a denial of the BIT\u2019S advantages by the host State.\n\n174.\n\nAs provided by Procedural Order No. 2 of 10 February 2010 (point 10), the date on which the conditions for a valid and effective denial of advantages are to be met in the instant case is the date of the Notice of Arbitration, *i.e.* 8 May 2009, this being the date on which Claimant has claimed the BIT\u2019S advantages that Respondent intends to deny.\n\n175.\n\nHaving thus established the time under Article 1(2) of the BIT when the natural person who ultimately controls Ulysseas must be identified, the Tribunal will proceed to determine whether the evidence provided by the Parties permits such identification. Based on the established terms of reference and the available evidence, it is the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Claimant has conclusively proven that Mr. Paul E. Singer, a national of the United States of America, controls Ulysseas. The analysis that follows supports this conclusion.\n\n176.\n\nThe Abbreviated Ownership Structure Chart (the \"Chart\") filed by Claimant359 shows that Claimant is 100% owned by Highwood Partners L.P., which is in turn owned by Highwood Associates, Inc. (as to 1%) and Elliott Associates L.P. (as to 99%), the latter owning 100% of Highwood Associates. This has been accepted by Respondent,360 subject to an objection that shall be considered below.361 The Chart does not show, however, who controls Elliott Associates.\n\nAbbreviated Ownership Structure of Ulysseas v. 2, Exhibits C-JURI-21 and R-51, marked as confidential by Claimant,.\n\nReply, para. 64.\n\n*Infra,* paras. 181-189.\n\n177.\n\nThe Thirteenth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of Elliott Associates L.P. dated 1 July 2009, between Paul E. Singer, Elliott Capital Advisors, L.P. and Elliott Special GP, LLC, filed by Claimant,362 shows that Elliott Associates has three general partners.\n\nThirteenth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of Elliott Associates L.P. dated 1 July 2009, Exhibit C-JURI-6.\n\n178.\n\nHowever, this document does not permit the identification with certainty of the natural persons controlling the latter two entities. Specifically, it does not permit to conclude that Mr. Singer is the only general partner of those entities.\n\n179.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s direction of 7 June 2010, Claimant has filed on 15 June 2010 a certain number of documents proving conclusively that Mr. Paul E. Singer is the natural person ultimately controlling Ulysseas. The documents in question have been produced under cover of the Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties.\n\n180.\n\nAt the hearing, Claimant requested that the \"Singer structure above the Claimant [...] not be detailed by name, so that the confidential information is not...\" [Counsel\u2019s intervention incomplete].363 It is the Tribunal\u2019s understanding that this request refers to the documents filed under cover of Claimant\u2019s e-mail of 15 June 2010. There is no need to describe in detail the ownership structure above Elliott Associates L.P. considering that Respondent has accepted at the hearing both this structure364 and the fact that Mr. Paul E. Singer is a national of the United States.365\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 80, lines 2-6.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 67, lines 21-25.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 68, lines 15-16.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider Respondent\u2019s objection to the ownership structure above Ulysseas, as described in the Chart produced by Claimant,366 namely that \"the line of control between Ulysseas and Elliott Associates L.P. is broken: it is broken by virtue of the joint venture agreement and it is diverted to the Synergy Group and Mr. Efromovich.\"367 The basic premise of this objection is that \"control\" as legal capacity to direct the actions of a company is not limited to ownership. It may be exercised through contractual rights when there are contractual rights which are not revocable.368\n\nAbbreviated Ownership Structure of Ulysseas v. 2, Exhibits C-JURI-21 and R-51, marked as confidential by Claimant.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 68, lines 4-7.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 51, lines 7-14.\n\n182.\n\nThis concerns the JVA between Elliott Associates, L.P. and Elliott International, L.P., on one side (the \"Elliott Group\"), and Veredas, on the other, dated 18 January 2002369. Pursuant to the JVA, Proteus was established, Elliott Group and Veredas each owning 50% of the company. Proteus is party as Charterer to two Bareboat Charter Party agreements with Claimant, as Owner (as successor to the previous owners of the two Barges), regarding the one PBI and the other PBII.370. By the Amendment to JVA dated 29 June 2007,371 the participations to Proteus were modified, Elliott Group now owning 60% and Veredas 40%. Also under the Amended JVA, however, fundamental decisions regarding Proteus continue to require the consent of both joint venture parties.372\n\nJoint Venture Agreement dated 18 January 2002, Exhibit C-JURI-42, marked as confidential by Claimant. See *supra,* para. 45.\n\nBareboat Charter Party between Cayman Power Barge I, Ltd. and Proteus Power Co., Inc., dated 18 January 2002, Exhibits C-JURI-33 and R-25, marked as confidential by Claimant; Bareboat Charter Party between Odyssea Vessels, Inc. and Proteus Power Co., Inc., dated 18 January 2002, Exhibits C-JURI-33 and R-26, marked as confidential by Claimant.\n\nAmendment to Joint Venture Agreement, dated 29 June 2007, Exhibit C-JURI-44, marked as confidential by Claimant. See *supra,* paras. 45, 56.\n\nAmended JVA, Sect. 5.4.\n\n183.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Veredas is a Bahamian company of the non-United States Synergy Group controlled by Mr. Germ\u00e1n Efromovich.373 It is Respondent\u2019s submission that as a result of the Amended JVA, the conduct of Ulysseas, as an affiliate of Elliott Group, is beholden as to vital aspects of its decisions over the Barges,374 including budget for expenditures of the Barges and signature of power purchase agreements, to the written consent of Veredas, a company controlled by a Brazilian national, Mr. Efromovich.375\n\nReply, para. 72; *supra,* para. 115.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 23, lines 15-18.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 25, lines 10-20.\n\n184.\n\nThe consequence, according to Respondent, is that Claimant is subject to legal control of the Synergy Group, and of its ultimate controller Mr. Efromovich, since its conduct with regard to the Barges remains subject to the JVA.376 It is Respondent\u2019s submission that this is an instance of control for the purpose of Article 1(2) of the BIT.377 The control in this case is obtained \"through a contractual mechanism.\"378 Also the powers of attorney granted by Ulysseas were made expressly subject to the limits of the JVA.379\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, pp. 23-25.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 25, lines 21-23.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 26, lines 11-12.\n\nReply, para. 69.\n\n185.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position is therefore that Claimant is controlled through the Amended JVA by the joint-venture party, Veredas, the latter having a veto power over vital decisions regarding the business that is the subject of the joint venture. Since Veredas is ultimately controlled by a Brazilian national, Mr. Efromovich, Claimant is controlled by a national of a third country.\n\n186.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Respondent\u2019s reasoning for a number of reasons. Firstly, the veto power enjoyed by Veredas under the Amended JVA does not give that party a control over the affairs of Proteus. The latter\u2019s inability to conduct its business by reason of deadlocks in the decision-making process would bring about the dissolution of the company,380 each joint venture party regaining in that case full and independent freedom of action.\n\nThis is regulated by Sect. 14.3 of the Amended JVA. See also *supra,* para. 55.\n\n187.\n\nFurther, even admitting that Veredas exercises a measure of control over Proteus, this would only mean that Veredas, and through it the ultimate controller of the Synergy Group, Mr. Efromovich, controls Proteus as Charterer of PBI and PBII.\n\n188.\n\nHowever, controlling the Charterer of PBI and PBII, the two Barges owned by Claimant, does not mean controlling the Claimant but only controlling a line of Proteus\u2019 business. As suggested by a question put to Respondent\u2019s counsel during the hearing by one Arbitrator,381 control over a company\u2019s business does not give control over the company. The latter may always change its line of business should its shareholders or partners so decide by providing the necessary financial resources, abandoning the line of business that has proved to be inoperable or uneconomical.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 53, lines 23-25: p. 54, lines 1-11.\n\n189.\n\nFor all the reasons stated above, Respondent\u2019s objection that the line of control between Claimant and Elliott Associates is broken by reason of the JVA in favour of the Synergy Group and Mr. Efromovich cannot be accepted. While this suffices to dispose of the Respondent\u2019s defence, it should also be pointed out that the Respondent has not established the nationality of Mr. Efromovich.\n\n190.\n\nClaimant has produced conclusive evidence that Ulysseas is controlled by a U.S. national, Mr. Paul E.

Commencement of the Arbitration Proceedings and Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 8 May 2009, Claimant served a Notice of Arbitration on Respondent alleging breaches of the Treaty between The United States of America and The Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the \"BIT\").\n\n2.\n\nBy letter dated 31 July 2009 and pursuant to Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (the \"UNCITRAL Rules\"), Claimant informed Respondent of its appointment of Professor Michael Pryles as Arbitrator.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated 1 October 2009 and pursuant to Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Rules, Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stem as Arbitrator.\n\n4.\n\nOn 30 October 2009, the Co-arbitrators agreed on the choice of Professor Piero Bernardini as Presiding Arbitrator.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter dated 3 November 2009, the Presiding Arbitrator informed the Parties that the Tribunal had been duly constituted and invited Respondent to submit its Answer to the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration by 23 November 2009.\n\n6.\n\nOn 23 November 2009, Respondent submitted its Answer to the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s direction.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 25 November 2009, the Tribunal noted the Parties\u2019 agreement to retain the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"PCA\") as administrator of the proceedings and concurred with this agreement.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 27 November 2009, the Tribunal sent to the Parties draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules for their review and comment by 18 December 2009, and invited the Parties to agree on a calendar for the proceedings by the same date.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 9 December 2009, the Tribunal confirmed that the initial hearing would be held at the Peace Palace, in The Hague, on 15 January 2010, as agreed upon by Respondent and Claimant in their letters of 4 and 7 December 2009, respectively. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that the PCA had appointed Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu as the administrative secretary for the case and invited them to confirm that they agreed to the appointment by 18 December 2009.\n\n10.\n\nBy separate letters dated 18 December 2009, Claimant and Respondent successively informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been unable to agree on a procedural calendar, indicated their respective position on said calendar, and provided their comments on the draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules circulated by the Tribunal. Respondent also confirmed in its letter its acceptance of the terms by which Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu would serve as administrative secretary to the Tribunal. Claimant did so in a subsequent letter dated 21 December 2009.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated 23 December 2009, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, circulated updated draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules in anticipation of the initial hearing.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 12 January 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties that, due to bad weather conditions in Europe and additional professional commitments, Mr. Pryles would be unable to attend the initial hearing in person on 15 January 2010, but would attend by video conference.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 13 January 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, circulated further updated draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules in anticipation of the initial hearing.\n\n**2. Initial Hearing**\n----------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 15 January 2010, an initial hearing was held at the Peace Palace, in The Hague, The Netherlands. Present at the initial hearing were:\n\n**Tribunal:**\n\nProf. Piero Bernardini, Presiding Arbitrator\n\nProf. Michael Pryles (by video conference)\n\nProf. Brigitte Stem\n\n**For Claimant:**\n\nMr. James Loftis Mr. Mark Beeley Mr. Justin Marlles\n\n**For Respondent:**\n\nDr. Alvaro Galindo Mr. Alejandro Escobar Ms. Dorine Farah\n\n**Permanent Court of Arbitration:**\n\nMr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu\n\n15.\n\nAt the initial hearing, the Terms of Appointment were agreed upon and signed by the Parties and the Tribunal, Professor Pryles having authorized the use of its electronic signature. The Presiding Arbitrator signed the Procedural Rules on behalf of the Tribunal. Signed originals of each document were handed out to each Party and member of the Tribunal. Having heard the arguments of the Parties with respect to the case, the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the proceedings and established the procedural calendar.\n\n**3. Written Phase of the Proceedings**\n---------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated 20 January 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, circulated the summary minutes of the initial hearing that took place on 15 January 2010, along with an audio-CD containing the recording of the initial hearing. The PCA invited the Parties to submit their comments on these summary minutes by 27 January 2010. The PCA also circulated on behalf of the Tribunal Procedural Order No. 1 dated 20 January 2010, which set out the procedural calendar established at the initial hearing.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter dated 20 January 2010, Claimant noted a disparity between Procedural Order No. 1 and the summary minutes of the initial hearing with respect to the date by which the first round of document productions should be made, and asked the Tribunal for clarification. By letter of the same date, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties that the correct date was 29 January 2010, not 27 January 2010, and circulated a duly amended Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 22 January 2010 and in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Claimant submitted its First Request for the Production of Documents.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated 22 January 2010 and in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Respondent submitted its Request for Production of Documents in the form of a Redfern Schedule.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated 25 January 2010, Claimant submitted a Redfern Schedule relating to Claimant\u2019s document requests.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter dated 29 January 2010, Claimant submitted its responses and objections to Respondent\u2019s Request for Production of Documents dated 22 January 2010 in the form of a Redfern Schedule, along with a document entitled Responses and Objections.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated 29 January 2010, Respondent submitted, in the form of a Redfern Schedule, its responses to Claimant\u2019s First Request for the Production of Documents dated 22 January 2010, as well as an index of the documents it produced.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated 4 February 2010, Claimant submitted to the Tribunal its replies to Respondent\u2019s Response to Claimant\u2019s Request for Document Production.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter dated 5 February 2010, Respondent submitted its updated Redfern Schedule, and its responses to Claimant\u2019s Objections to Respondent\u2019s Request for Production of Documents.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter dated 5 February 2010, Claimant submitted a confidential structure chart identifying the abbreviated ownership structure of Ulysseas.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter dated 8 February 2010, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was unable to limit or abandon its request for production of documents, as Claimant had expected in light of its submission of a structure chart identifying its abbreviated ownership structure.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter dated 10 February 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal and in accordance with the schedule established in Procedural Order No. 1, circulated Procedural Order No. 2 which recorded the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Parties\u2019 Requests for Document Production. Procedural Order No. 2 provided, *inter alia,* that Claimant had to produce certain documents in response to Respondent\u2019s Request No. 4, provided that the Parties entered into a confidentiality agreement regarding these documents.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter dated 19 February 2010, Respondent drew to the Tribunal\u2019s attention that Claimant was refusing to accept certain provisions of Respondent\u2019s executed agreement on confidentiality, and on that basis was refusing to produce the documents responsive to Respondent\u2019s Request No. 4 until a confidentiality agreement has been reached. Respondent requested the Tribunal to direct the Parties as follows:\n\nA. to confirm that the Claimant\u2019s refusal to accept the terms of the Respondent\u2019s already executed agreement on confidentiality is unreasonable;\n\nB. to confirm that the Respondent has executed and delivered an agreement on confidentiality that is sufficient for the Claimant to produce the documents responsive to the Respondent\u2019s request No. 4, as required by Procedural Order No. 2;\n\nC. to instruct the Claimant to produce such documents forthwith and within 24 hours of the Tribunal so directing;\n\nD. to amend the procedural schedule to take account of the Claimant\u2019s delay in producing documents in accordance with Procedural Orders No. 1 and No. 2, so that the time period for submitting Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction extends to one month from the date on which the Claimant produces the requested documentation; and\n\nE. to draw the appropriate inferences from the Claimant\u2019s refusal to accept the Respondent\u2019s executed confidentiality agreement.\n\n29.\n\nAfter further correspondence between the Parties on this issue, the PCA, by letter dated 23 February 2010 and under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties that the Tribunal had examined the Parties\u2019 exchange of correspondence relating to the Confidentiality Agreement and invited the Parties to reconcile their positions without delay so as not to disrupt the agreed calendar of the proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nFollowing a further exchange of correspondence between the Parties regarding Claimant\u2019s document production, and a letter from Claimant dated 24 February 2010 informing the Tribunal that the issue regarding the conclusion of the confidentiality agreement should be resolved without the need for intervention by the Tribunal, the Parties entered into a Confidentiality Agreement on 26 February 2010.1\n\nLetter from Claimant to Respondent dated 9 March 2010, p. 5.\n\n31.\n\nIn subsequent correspondence exchanged by the Parties on 5, 9, and 16 March 2010, the Parties further discussed Claimant\u2019s document production and compliance with Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter dated 19 March 2010, Respondent submitted its Memorial on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction with Fact Exhibits and Legal Authorities in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter dated 19 April 2010, Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, with supporting Witness Statements, Fact Exhibits and Legal Authorities in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter dated 10 May 2010, Respondent submitted its Reply with Legal Authorities in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter dated 12 May 2010 and following confirmation by Respondent of its availability, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, confirmed that the hearing on jurisdiction would be held on 17-18 June 2010 in The Hague in the Peace Palace and invited the Parties to agree on a hearing schedule by 7 June 2010.\n\n36.\n\nBy letter dated 20 May 2010, Claimant informed Respondent that \"Elliott Associates, L.P. is willing to provide documents further supporting Mr. Veldwijk\u2019s statement regarding Paul Singer\u2019s control over the other two general partners in Elliott Associates, L.P.\" on the condition that \"the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between Ulysseas and the Republic of Ecuador dated February 25, 2010 are extended to include Elliott and any document produced by Elliott, and any such documents are treated as \u2018Confidential Material\u2019 pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.\" Claimant also enclosed a letter to this effect from Elliott Associates, L.P.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter dated 25 May 2010, Respondent replied to Claimant\u2019s letter dated 20 May 2010 stating that Claimant did not comply with Procedural Order No. 2 in a timely fashion and \"may not do so now at this late stage.\"\n\n38.\n\nBy letter dated 31 May 2010, Claimant submitted its Rejoinder with Legal Authorities in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter dated 7 June 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties of the Tribunal\u2019s following directions:\n\n1. In application of Section 3.3 of the Procedural Rules of January 15, 2010, Claimant shall produce the documents indicated in its letter of May 20, 2010 regarding Paul Singer\u2019s control over the other two general partners in Elliott Associates L.P. This evidence, which is directly relevant to the question of jurisdiction to be decided by the Tribunal, is not covered by Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n2. Claimant's request that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with Respondent dated February 25, 2010 be extended to cover the documents to be so produced is justified in light of Elliott Associates\u2019 counsel\u2019s letter of May 20, 2010. Respondent is therefore invited to agree to such extension.\n\n3. These additional documents shall be produced not later that June 14, 2010. Respondent shall have an opportunity to comment on such documents either in writing soon thereafter or in the course of its oral submission at the hearing.\n\n4. On a different matter, Claimant is invited to have available at the hearing the unredacted text of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) dated January 18, 2002 (C-JURI-42) and of the Amended JVA dated June 29, 2007 (C-JURI-44), should the Tribunal decide to inspect them.\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal having granted a one-day extension to the Parties, at their request, for the submission of a hearing schedule, Claimant, on behalf of the Parties, informed the Tribunal of the agreed schedule by letter dated 8 June 2010. The schedule indicated, *inter alia,* that Mr. Zacharia Korn, one of Claimant\u2019s witnesses, would testify before the Tribunal.\n\n41.\n\nBy letter dated 10 June 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties that the proposed hearing schedule was agreeable to the Tribunal.\n\n42.\n\nBy e-mail dated 15 June 2010, Claimant submitted electronic copies of the documents that it was requested to submit pursuant to paragraph 1 of the PCA\u2019s letter dated 7 June 2010, and informed the PCA that hard copies of the documents had previously been provided to Respondent under cover of the Parties\u2019 Confidentiality Agreement. By letter of the same date, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal and in accordance with paragraph 3 of the PCA\u2019s letter dated 7 June 2010, informed the Parties that Respondent was invited to submit its comments on the above-mentioned documents at the upcoming hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n43.\n\nBy letter dated 15 June 2010, Respondent submitted English translations of certain Fact Exhibits and Legal Authorities.\n\n**4. Hearing on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nOn 17 and 18 June 2010, the hearing on jurisdiction was held at the Peace Palace, in The Hague, The Netherlands.

Respondent had been allowed to see an unredacted copy of the JVA and Amendment to JVA on the first hearing day, after the session. (Transcript (Hearing on Jurisdiction), Day 2, p. 19:5-9). The JVA as amended by the Amendment to JVA will be hereinafter referred to as the \"Amended JVA\".\n\n46.\n\nBy letter dated 28 June 2010, Claimant submitted copies of the slides used in support of Claimant\u2019s Opening and Reply Statements at the hearing on jurisdiction. By letter dated 1 July 2010, the PCA transmitted copies of these slides to Respondent, at the request of the latter.\n\n**5. Interim Award**\n--------------------\n\n47.\n\nBy letter dated 30 September 2010, the PCA transmitted to the Parties on behalf of the Tribunal signed copies of the Tribunal\u2019s Interim Award in English and Spanish. For the reasons set out in that award, the Tribunal decided the following:\n\na) that the two objections presented by Respondent do not deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction over all treaty claims;\n\nb) to make the necessary order for the continuation of the procedure;\n\nc) to reserve all questions concerning the costs of arbitration, as defined by Article 38 of UNCITRAL Rules, for subsequent determination;\n\nd) to dismiss any other relief requested by either Party, concerning the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration.5\n\nInterim Award, para. 193.\n\n**B.** Merits Phase\n-------------------\n\n**1. Establishment of the Calendar**\n------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nBy letter dated 1 October 2010, the Tribunal invited the Parties to agree on a procedural calendar for the continuation of the proceedings by 18 October 2010 or, failing such an agreement, each Party to file its proposed calendar.\n\n49.\n\nBy letter dated 14 October 2010, Mr. Martin Doe informed the Parties that he would replace Mr. Paul-Jean LeCannu as administrative secretary on behalf of the PCA.\n\n50.\n\nFollowing an extension until 22 October 2010 of the deadline for the Parties to agree on a procedural calendar and various exchanges regarding the Parties\u2019 and Tribunal\u2019s availability for a hearing in The Hague, the Parties informed the Tribunal by e-mail dated 22 October 2010 that they had agreed on a procedural calendar, according to which Claimant should submit its Statement of Claim by 1 March 2011; Respondent should submit its Statement of Defence by 1 July 2011; Claimant should submit its Reply by 15 August 2011 and Respondent should submit its Rejoinder by 3 October 2011. From 1 November 2011, on a date to be fixed by the Tribunal, a conference call with the Tribunal should take place to settle the order of proceedings at the hearing. The hearing on the merits was agreed to be held on 5-9 December 2011 at the Peace Palace in The Hague.\n\n51.\n\nBy letter dated 27 October 2010, the PCA, under instruction from the Tribunal, informed the Parties that the Tribunal approved the Parties\u2019 agreed procedural calendar.\n\n**2. Written Phase**\n--------------------\n\n52.\n\nBy letter dated 1 March 2011, Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim, with supporting Witness Statements, Expert Reports, Fact Exhibits and Legal Authorities.\n\n53.\n\nBy letter dated 1 July 2011, Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence, with supporting Witness Statements, Expert Reports, Fact Exhibits and Legal Authorities.\n\n54.\n\nBy letter dated 15 August 2011, Claimant submitted its Statement of Reply, with supporting Exhibits, Witness Statements and Expert Reports.\n\n55.\n\nBy letter dated 17 August 2011, Respondent requested additional evidence to support the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Zacharia Korn and the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Jan Veldwijk, which were said not to be supported by any documentary evidence accompanying the Reply. In particular, Respondent requested Claimant to provide (i) the documents through which Mr. Korn discovered that the PBII Bareboat Charter Party was never amended or extended; (ii) the documents, including financial statements and payment schedules, showing the date of actual and prospective payments made by or due from Proteus Power, Inc. pursuant to the PBII Bareboat Charter Party; and (iii) the documents by which, or evidencing the date on which, Ulysseas, Inc. and Proteus Power, Inc. released each other from any further obligations under the PBII Bareboat Charter Party.\n\n56.\n\nBy letter dated 19 August 2011, Claimant responded to Respondent\u2019s request for additional evidence. As to the first request, Claimant noted that, as the Charter Party had not been amended or extended, there was no document which extended or amended it. As to the second and third request, Claimant announced that it would prepare a certified schedule showing the payments that were actually made by Proteus Power to Claimant; and referred Claimant to the terms of the Charter Party as to the other questions.\n\n57.\n\nBy letter dated 23 August 2011, Respondent noted that Claimant had declined to provide the financial statements requested and expressed its view that the document alleged to support Mr. Veldwijk\u2019s assertion - \"a certified schedule showing the payments\" - would cause it prejudice and should not therefore be copied to the Tribunal.\n\n58.\n\nBy letter dated 24 August 2011, Claimant noted that the document was an extract of the financial records requested and affirmed that the new evidence was provided as a response to Respondent\u2019s request. On the same date, Claimant submitted an electronic copy of the Exhibit.\n\n59.\n\nBy letter dated 3 October 2011, Respondent submitted its Statement of Rejoinder, with supporting Fact Exhibits, Legal Authorities, Witness Statements and Expert Reports.\n\n60.\n\nOn 31 October 2011, the PCA held a telephone conference call with the Parties in order to discuss administrative and logistical matters relating to the hearing.\n\n61.\n\nBy letter dated 4 November 2011, the Parties submitted a list of agreed procedural issues relating to the hearing (\"Procedural Agreement of the Parties\").\n\n62.\n\nOn 7 November 2011, the Tribunal held a telephone conference call with the Parties in order to discuss the order of proceedings and other procedural matters relating to the hearing.\n\n63.\n\nBy letter dated 21 November 2011, Claimant submitted supplemental evidence in accordance with the Procedural Agreement of the Parties.\n\n64.\n\nBy e-mail dated 22 November 2011, Respondent submitted supplemental evidence in accordance with the Procedural Agreement of the Parties.\n\n65.\n\nBy letter dated 22 November 2011, Respondent noted that the Procedural Agreement of the Parties allowed only the submission of an update \"provided it refers to events occurring after the last submission of each party\" and invited Claimant to withdraw its submission of the engine log books (C-270, submitted with its supplemental evidence), which referred to facts that occurred \"long before the parties\u2019 last pleading, and even before the Claimant\u2019s Statement of Claim.\"\n\n66.\n\nBy letter dated 24 November 2011, Claimant noted that it \"ha[d] only exhibited the full log book [C-270 Eng] in light of the specific attack being led against its evidence\" and requested certain translations and explanations in relation to Respondent\u2019s supplemental evidence.\n\n67.\n\nBy letter dated 28 November 2011, Claimant submitted 4 demonstrative exhibits it intended to rely on during its opening submissions.\n\n68.\n\nAfter further correspondence between the Parties on this issue, Respondent stated it was prepared to accept the introduction of Exhibit C-270 into the record and further submitted R-317, containing the CENACE data corresponding to the dates covered by the engine log book contained in C-270, as \"it [was] necessary to submit this data since it is the only source that serves to corroborate or correct the engine log book entries.\" The Claimant did not object to the presentation of R-317.\n\n**3.

The present Chapter shall deal with the facts of the case to the extent they are relevant for the merits phase of the proceedings. Limited repetitions of what has already been mentioned in the Interim Award are justified by the need to ensure a logical sequence to the present summary.\n\n77.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the productivity of the electricity sector in Ecuador began deteriorating. Starting in 1993, Respondent, in the context of a broader programme of privatisation of public services, opened up this sector to private investment in order to satisfy rapidly growing demands. At the time, Ecuador had in fact experienced a significant shortfall in the available power generation capacity due to the crisis of 1992 and 1993-1996, resulting in increasing disparity between supply and demand in the sector.6\n\nSee Statement of Defence, paras. 39-41; Statement of Claim, para. 18.\n\n78.\n\nThe privatisation programme was formally commenced in the electricity sector with the enactment by the Ecuadorian Parliament of the Power Sector Regime Law on 10 October 1996 (\"Power Sector Regime Law\").7 This Law established a new legal framework by providing a series of mechanisms to create a competitive electricity market promoting efficiency and private participation in the sector. In addition to separating power generation, transmission and distribution activities into separate corporate entities, the new law encouraged further development of electricity capacity by authorising private companies to enter the market through concession agreements.8\n\nThe Power Sector Regime Law 1996, dated 10 October 1996, Exhibit CLA10, R86.\n\n*Id.* See also Statement of Claim, para. 18.\n\n79.\n\nBy the time Claimant executed the PBII Contract, on 12 September 2006, the legal and regulatory framework established by the Power Sector Regime Law was essentially made up of the following laws and regulations:\n\n\u2022 The 1998 Constitution;9\n\n\u2022 The Power Sector Regime Law;\n\n\u2022 The Power Sector Regime Law Regulations 1997;10\n\n\u2022 The Concession Regulations;11\n\n\u2022 The SNI Regulation 1999;12\n\n\u2022 The WEM Regulations 2003 establishing the Wholesale Electricity Market *(Mercado El\u00e9ctrico Mayorista)* consisting of generators, distributors and large consumers integrated into the National Interconnected System;13\n\n\u2022 The Inter-Institutional Agreement to Implement National Policy of the Electricity Sector introduced in 2003 to substantially reform the sector and make it more transparent in order to promote investments and eventually reduce tariffs to the end consumer;14\n\n\u2022 CONELEC\u2019s National Electrification Plan for 2002-2011 and National Electrification Plan for 2004-2013 containing detailed incentives to invest.15\n\nConstitution of Ecuador, dated 11 August 1998, Exhibit CLA19.\n\nPresidential Decree No. 754, dated 28 October 1997, Exhibit CLA12.\n\nConcessions Regulations, dated 31 March 1998, Exhibit R87.\n\nNational Interconnected System Regulation, dated 23 February 1999, Exhibit R95.\n\nPresidential Decree No. 923, dated 16 October 2003, Exhibit CLA42.\n\nInter-Institutional Agreement to Implement a National Policy of the Electricity Sector, dated 21 July 2003, Exhibit C34.\n\nPlan Nacional de Electrificaci\u00f3n 2002-2011, Exhibit C24 and Plan Nacional de Electrificaci\u00f3n 2004-2013, Exhibit C44.\n\n80.\n\nUnder Article 13 of the WEM Regulation 2003, the price of electricity in the spot market was determined according to the economic cost of producing electricity. The price was to be uniform and calculated to reward the most efficient (i.e., most economical) power generators in terms of variable production cost.16\n\nArticle 13 of the WEM Regulations, *supra* note 13 (\"The *energy is priced with the instantaneous marginal economic cost obtained from the actual dispatch of generation at the end of each hour. Instantaneous marginal cost of energy in the Market Bar is given by the last source of generation which, under economic dispatch conditions, meets the system demand [...]\").*\n\n81.\n\nIn accordance with SNI Regulation 1999, generators were to declare to CENACE their variable cost of producing of electricity in a *\"truthful and timely manned'* and on a monthly basis.17 The variable cost was principally a function of the cost of fuel multiplied by its efficiency in generating electricity from that fuel.18\n\nArticle 14 of the SNI Regulations, *supra* note 12 (\"77ze *generators synchronized to the electrical system are required to provide CENACE, in a truthful and timely manner, information upon its request to conduct operational planning, the* *central dispatch and the integrated operation of the Electric System, as established by the Dispatch and Operating Procedures\"').*\n\nSee Article 5 of CONELEC Regulation No. 003/03, dated 13 August 2003, Exhibit CLA40.\n\n82.\n\nUpon receiving this information, CENACE determined the price of electricity in the spot market on an hourly basis. It did so by calculating the demand and supply of electricity based on the relevant data provided by the generators.19 CENACE set the uniform variable cost at the variable cost of the least efficient generator for which there was demand.20 CENACE then called upon the generators to dispatch electricity until demand was met, in an ascending order of the variable cost declared by each generator. As a result, a generator that declared a low variable cost was able to sell all of the electricity that it was able to make available. The least efficient generators (i.e., those with higher variable costs) were ranked lower in the order of dispatch and would not be able to dispatch the electricity generated if there was no corresponding demand.21\n\nArticle 8(b) of the SNI Regulations 1999, *supra* note 11 *(f CENACE [...] shall calculate the economic dispatch schedule for generation resources subject to central dispatch and energy transfers through international interconnections, in such a form that the scheduled demands are met and the operating costs are minimized, considering [...] the Variable Costs of Generating Units [...]\").*\n\nArticle 13 of the WEM Regulations, *supra* note 13 (\" *Instantaneous marginal cost of energy in the source of generation* [which] *under economic dispatch conditions meets the system demands [...]\").*\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 47.\n\n83.\n\nUnlike sales on the spot market, forward contracts, also called power purchase agreements (\"PPAs\"), were those that were negotiated freely between generators and distributors, between generators and large consumers and between distributors and large consumers. The parties to the PPA, therefore, agreed on a price that applied over the term of the agreement. Generators selling power under PPAs, however, still had to declare their variable costs to CENACE which would then determine their ranking in the order of dispatch based on their efficiency according to the same principles as those applicable to spot sales.22\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 49. See also Article 29 of the WEM Regulations 2003, *supra* note 13.\n\n84.\n\nAt the time of the signature of PBI Contract *{infra,* para. 94), the basic structure for payment for electricity was as follows:\n\n(a) End users paid distribution companies for electricity, which the distribution companies purchased from generators, either by way of the spot market or under longer-term PPAs.\n\n(b) The distribution companies had historically failed to make payments to the generation companies and had attempted to make the generation companies bear the risk of consumer non-payments or low tariffs (which were centrally regulated). Respondent had previously acknowledged that the end user tariffs were not set at a sufficiently high level to cover the generation and transmission costs, and had previously made a \u2018Tariff Deficit\u2019 payment in the period 1999/2001 to make up the shortfall.\n\n(c) In an attempt to improve the situation, a system of *fideicomisos* (\"Payment Trusts\") was established in July 1999. The Payment Trusts were to provide a safe, reliable and transparent handling of payments and collections within the WEM. Under this system, each distribution company created a trust, which received payments from the end users and who then paid the generators (and other expenses of the distribution companies).\n\n(d) The priority order set forth in the Payment Trusts positioned the private generators (like Claimant) in second place, immediately after the distribution company who was entitled to receive certain State regulated distribution costs or valor agregado de distribuci\u00f3n (\"VAD\"). The VAD was set on the basis of a calculation which was designed to arrive at the average costs of a theoretical efficient transmission company.\n\n(e) The priority order is important because the ultimate tariff charged to end users is capped at such a level that there are insufficient funds for all the expenses incurred by the distribution companies to be covered and to fully pay each generation company. Accordingly, if the generators are high on the priority list, they will be promptly and fully paid by the Payment Trusts; if they are low, they will only get part or no payment at all.23\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 26.\n\n85.\n\nThe priorities were modified in July 2003 through the Inter-Institutional Agreement to Implement National Policy of the Electricity Sector, which established an annex to be incorporated in the Trust Agreements. The Annex established the following priority order:\n\n(a) **PRIORITY**  **0:** Return of billings based on FERUM rates, Fire Fighter, Waste Collection, and others existing at the Distributing Companies.\n\n(b) **PRIORITY 1**\n\ni. **PRIORITY 1-A:** Payment of 100% of imported power;\n\nii. priority **1-B:** Payment of 100% of power delivered by private capital stock companies **(i.e. Claimant);**\n\niii. priority **1-c:** Payment of the amount billed by PETROCOMERCIAL for the supply of fuel oil and diesel to State-owned generating companies, including distributing companies with thermal power generations;\n\niv. priority **1-D:** Payment made proportionally, with the balance, to State-owned thermoelectric and hydroelectric power generating companies and to distributing companies holding non-split hydraulic and thermal power plants.\n\n(c) **PRIORITY 2:** To cover payments to TRANSELECTRIC.\n\n(d) **PRIORITY**  **3:** To cover payments to distributing companies in terms of VAD.\n\n(e) priority **4:** To cover payments to generating and transmission companies with balances pending billing for the immediately preceding month.\n\n(f) **PRIORITY 5:** To cover payments to generating and transmission companies with accounts receivable from the distributors.24\n\nAnnex to be incorporated in the trust agreements based on the Inter-Institutional Agreement to Implement a National Policy of the Electricity Sector, see *supra* note 14, Exhibit C34.\n\n86.\n\nIn December 2004, another revision was introduced with the following priority order:\n\n1st *Fondo de Electrificaci\u00f3n Rural* (FERUM), fireman and refuse collection taxes;\n\n2nd VAD payments;\n\n3rd Transelectric;\n\n4th Generation companies based outside of Ecuador, i.e. Colombia;\n\n**5th** Private generation **(i.e. Claimant);**\n\n6th State-owned generations companies.25\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 35; Statement of Defence, para. 58.\n\n87.\n\nThe Payment Trusts were further amended in May 2005 by Presidential Decree No. 105/2005, which modified the priority payment order and established \"the following order:\n\n1. Balances pending to hydroelectric generating companies that are carrying out investment projects in hydroelectric generation that have liquidity problems in developing the aforesaid projects, in accordance with the corresponding schedule and the instructions of the Solidarity Fund and the CENACE.\n\n2. Balances pending to thermoelectric generating companies from the Solidarity Fund and CATEG-Generacion, to finance the 2005 annual maintenance plan of the units of the generating companies owned by the Solidarity Fund and CATEG-Generacion approved by the CENACE and the purchase of fuel according to instructions from the Solidarity Fund and the CENACE in all cases.\n\n3. Balances pending to private generating companies.\n\n4. Balances pending to other hydroelectric generating companies.\n\n5. Balances pending for the rest of generation.\n\n6. Restitution to distribution companies of funds used to pay for power generation.\n\n7. Balances pending for fuel purchases owed to PETROECUADOR.\"26\n\nArticle 2 of Presidential Decree No. 105, dated 20 May 2005, Exhibit CLA86.\n\n88.\n\nIn 2005, by Presidential Decree No. 436/2005, Respondent formalised what was known as the \"Fuel for Power\" programme.27 This was an emergency measure introduced in an attempt to provide an incentive to private generation companies to generate power despite the collection difficulties. In essence, the programme allowed private generators to purchase fuel from State-held PETROECUADOR on credit, which credit could later be settled by way of sale of electricity to State-owned transmission companies or end users. This programme was a particularly attractive measure as fuel costs (which would normally be suffered upfront) typically account for some 60-70% of a private generator\u2019s operating costs.28 The *Fuel for Power* programme ended in October 2007.29\n\nPresidential Decree No. 436, dated 24 August 2005, Exhibit CLA59.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 43.\n\nClaimant asserts that the *\"Fuel For Power\"* programme was terminated by Presidential Decree No. 683, dated 31 October 2007, Exhibit CLA69, while Respondent has argued that the programme was not abolished, but *\"it expired on its own terms.\"* (Statement of Defence, para. 138). In addition, Respondent contends that analogous measures were in force after the termination of the \"Fuel for Power\" programme (RPHS, para. 11).\n\n89.\n\nIn August 2006, the payment priority order was again modified as follows:\n\n1. VAD\n\n2. Transelectric\n\n3 A. Energy import\n\n3B. Private generation with agreement 3C. Private generators for spot market 3D. Hydro generators from the Solidarity Fund\n\n3E. Private generators for spot market purchasing fuel from Petroecuador\n\n4. Remainder generation and transmission\n\n4A. Hydropaute, Termoesmeraldas, Electroguayas, Termopichincha, generation, distribution, Termoelectric\n\n4B. Petrocomercial\n\n5. Distributor, generation and transmission.30\n\nExpert Report of Mr. F. Mu\u00f1oz, dated 28 February 2011, filed by Claimant (\"Mu\u00f1oz Report\"), pp. 41-42.\n\n90.\n\nOn 18 April 2007, the Executive Committee for Electrical Policy (who by this time was in charge of advising CONELEC on policy matters and ensuring the implementation of the same) revised the payment priority, \"ratifying the following order:\n\n*ITEM PERCENTAGE*\n\n*1. Transmitter 67%*\n\n*2. Importation of energy 100%*\n\n*3. Payment for power made available 100%*\n\n*4. Private hydroelectric generators: sale of energy by contract 100%*\n\n*5.

According to Respondent, Mandate No. 15 improved the market by improving the rate of collection of generators and allowed generators to continue selling to the spot market (RPHS, paras. 14-15). Claimant contends that after the enactment of Mandate No. 15, PPAs represented the only potentially viable business model, since the business on the spot market was no longer possible (CPHS, para. 11).\n\n92.\n\nClaimant imported and installed PBI and PBII in Ecuador in late March/early April 2003 and on 16 April 2005, respectively, allegedly in order to take advantage of the more liberal market conditions introduced by Respondent.36\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 23 and 37.\n\n93.\n\nPBII was eventually installed at Las Esclusas. Before its arrival in Las Esclusas, Claimant had attempted to locate this barge at several other moorings in Ecuador, including at Puerto Hondo, allegedly investing significant time and funds in dredging and building out port facilities.37\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 40-41.\n\n94.\n\nThe concession contract for PBI was signed between Claimant and CONELEC on 15 August 2005 (\"PBI Contract\")38 and the one for PBII on 12 September 2006 (\"PBII Contract\", sometimes also referred to as \"Licence Contract\").39 The latter was amended on 6 June 2007 to take account of the new location of PBII in Las Esclusas, the amendment confirming all other provisions of the PBII Contract.40 Under the PBII Contract, the concessionaire had to generate electricity for a period of fifteen (15) years starting from the date of signature.41\n\nContrato de Permiso Para Generaci\u00f3n de Energ\u00eda between the Claimant and CONELEC in relation to PBI, dated 15 August 2005, Exhibit C9.\n\nContrato de Permiso Para Generaci\u00f3n de Energ\u00eda between the Claimant and CONELEC in relation to PBII, dated 12 September 2006, Exhibit CIO (\"PBII Contract\").\n\nAmendment to the PBII Licence Contract, dated 6 June 2007, Exhibit R31.\n\nArticle 7 of PBII Contract, *supra* note 39 **(\"SEVEN: PERMIT TERM AND EFFECTIVE DATE.** *The term of this contract is fifteen (15) years calculated beginning on the signature date of this document, at which time the Permit will become effective. During this period of time, the PERMIT HOLDER will hold all rights granted by Ecuadorian law, specifically the legal security described in Article twenty-three, number twenty-six and Article two hundred forty-nine of the Constitution. Prior to the end of the term of the contract, if the PERMIT HOLDER expresses an interest in continuing to operate, the GRANTOR will analyze the request, qualify the service provided during the term of the Contract and verify the condition of the equipment, and will authorize an extension of the PERMIT, if warranted. CONELEC may extend the term of the permit pursuant to the provisions of Article fifty-six of the Concessions Regulations. Extension of the Permit may not be granted for a period of time which exceeds the original period. \")*\n\n95.\n\nClaimant never started power generation operations from PBII even after the extension by the 6 June 2007 amendment of the deadline for commencement of power generation. According to Claimant, the ever-worsening situation of the electricity sector, with no prospects of profitable operations, left no other options available than to attempt to conclude a PPA before commencing power generation.42\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 47.\n\n96.\n\nFollowing meetings on 5 and 12 December 2007 and 31 January 2008 with the then Minister of Electricity Mosquera, Claimant attempted in early 2008 to conclude a PPA with CATEG (a distribution company wholly under the control of CONELEC) as well as with other entities, at a price that would allow PBII to both cover its costs and make a return on its investment. Negotiations failed, these companies only being willing to enter into cheaper PPAs than Claimant could accept.\n\n97.\n\nConsidering that performance of PBII Contract had become impossible in view of the degraded business environment for the electricity sector, on 21 December 2007 Claimant gave notice of force majeure under Article 25 of PBII Contract.43\n\nBy letter of 17 July 2008 CONELEC rejected Claimant\u2019s grounds, stating that it was under no obligation to ensure that Claimant had to receive commercially viable compensation in return tor generation.44\n\nLetter from Claimant to CONELEC, dated 21 December 2007, Exhibit C92.\n\nLetter from CONELEC to Claimant, dated 17 July 2008, Exhibit Cl 11.\n\n98.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, the prospect of sales on the spot market leading to collectable payment was non-existent; thus, on 23 April 2008, it requested that CONELEC agree to the termination of the PBII Contract.45 The request was denied on 12 September 2008 with the demand that power generation be commenced.46\n\nLetter from Claimant to CONELEC, dated 23 April 2008, Exhibit C107.\n\nLetter from CONELEC to Claimant, dated 12 September 2008, Exhibit Cl 16 *(\u2018Consequently, based on the conclusions stated in such Report, 1 insist to you that the Barge PBII initiate the appropriate operating tests, prior to its commercial operation, before Monday, September 22, 2008; otherwise, CONELEC reserves right to apply the provisions of the Power Sector Regime Law [... ]\")*\n\n99.\n\nShortly thereafter, CONELEC imposed a fine of US $63,647,51 on Claimant for having failed to commence generating power until that date.47\n\nLetter from CONELEC to Claimant, dated 17 October 2008, Exhibit Cl 18.\n\n100.\n\nA subsequent attempt to sell PBII to a State-owned entity, Termoesmeraldas, also failed. Respondent contends that a stalemate arose in the negotiations because of the conditions that Claimant wanted to impose, in particular those regarding operational tests.48 However, Termoesmeraldas also confessed, after seven months of negotiations, that it did not have the money to complete the purchase.49\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 125.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 50.\n\n101.\n\nIn April 2009, the Ministry invited PPA proposals from private generators, including Claimant, and drew up terms of reference for the negotiation of regulated PPAs with distribution companies (\"Terms of Reference\"). Under the Terms of Reference, private generators had to submit proposals based on two PPAs models. Proposals were received but not from Claimant, the latter alleging concerns about the \"Payment Trust\" mechanism as security for payment under a PPA.50\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, paras. 37-39.\n\n102.\n\nBy letter dated 24 September 2009, CONELEC informed Claimant that \"since it had not initiated generation activities [...] CONELEC w[ould] temporarily assume, through a delegate, the generation activities arising from the PBII Licence Contract.\"51 On 7 October 2009 a further letter from CONELEC was sent to Claimant informing it that \"under Article 3 of [Resolution No. 89/09], CONELEC, through a designated party, temporarily assumes generation activities that arise from the Permit Contract of Power Barge II.\"52 This letter also stipulated that \"CORPORACI\u00d3N EL\u00c9CTRICA DEL ECUADOR S.A., CELEC, ha[d] been designated as Temporary Administrator.\"53\n\nLetter from CONELEC to Claimant, dated 24 September 2009, Exhibit Cl30.\n\nLetter from CONELEC to Claimant, dated 7 October 2009, Exhibit Cl32.\n\n*Id.*\n\n103.\n\nOn October 8 2009, CONELEC proceeded to take actual control of PBII on 8 October 2009 by physically evicting Claimant\u2019s crew from the vessel.54\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 56.\n\n104.\n\nOn 19 March 2010, CONELEC indicated that it was prepared to hand back PBII requiring that \"a representative of [Claimant] receive Power Barge II and sign a corresponding Record of Delivery-Receipt, to be signed on the abovementioned date.\"55 It was Claimant\u2019s understanding that signing the receipt would not only acknowledge the return of the vessel, but also confirm that there was nothing improper in CONELEC\u2019s actions and that no harm had been done to the vessel.56 After 6 months, agreement was reached to the release of the vessel without these conditions.57 According to Claimant, a further fine was imposed on it in the meantime for not having generated power.58\n\nLetter from CONELEC to Claimant, dated 19 March 2010, Exhibit C143.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 61.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter to CONELEC, dated 8 September 2010, Exhibit C167 *(\"Ulysseas will take possession of Power Barge on September 27, 2010.

In this Award, the Tribunal discusses the arguments of the Parties most relevant for its decision and formulates its conclusions as to each issue regarding the merits of this case.\n\n108.\n\nBased on the respective contentions, the issues raised by the Parties in this merits phase center around the following principal questions:\n\na) whether the actions of certain entities of the public sector in the field of electricity are attributable to Respondent and whether their conduct was in breach of the BIT;\n\nb) whether the measures taken by Respondent were a temporary expropriation or tantamount to indirect expropriation and thus violated Article III(l) of the BIT;\n\nc) whether Respondent breached its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment by changing the legal and regulatory framework that was in place at the time the Claimant invested in Ecuador and thus breached Article II(3)(a) of the BIT;\n\nd) whether Respondent breached its obligation to provide full protection and security to the Claimant\u2019s investment under Article II(3)(a) of the BIT;\n\ne) whether Respondent took any discriminatory measure against Claimant in violation of Article II(3)(b) of the BIT;\n\nf) whether Respondent took any arbitrary measure against Claimant in violation of Article II(3)(b) of the BIT;\n\ng) whether Claimant is entitled to compensation for violation of the BIT by Respondent and, in the affirmative, for what amount.\n\n**A.** Applicable Law\n---------------------\n\n109.\n\nIn order to reach a decision on the above issues, the law applicable to the merits of the present dispute must be determined.\n\n110.\n\nArticle 33 (1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows:\n\n*\"The Arbitral Tribunal shall apply the law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute. Failing such designation by the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the law determined by the conflict of law rules which it considers applicable. \"*\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the rules of law applicable to the present dispute are primarily the provisions of the BIT.63 Some provisions of the BIT refer to international law,64 so that also the latter shall apply whenever necessary to complement the provisions of the BIT.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 214.\n\nSuch as Article II(3)(a), according to which \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" are accompanied by treatment no *\"less than that required by international law\",* or Article 11(10)(b) providing that the most favoured nation provisions of the BIT shall not apply to advantages accorded to nationals or companies of any third party, by virtue of either Party\u2019s *\"binding obligations under any multilateral international agreement under the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\",* or Article 111(2) according to which *\"expropriation and any associated compensation\"* must conform *\"to the principles of international law.\"*\n\n**B.** Attribution to Respondent of Measures Taken by Certain Entities\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s contentions**\n-----------------------------\n\n112.\n\nIn determining whether Ecuador is responsible for the conduct of its own State entities, Claimant refers to Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, to Articles 4 and 5 of the ILC Articles,65 to the award in the ICSID case of *Jan de Nul v. Egypt,66* and to the expert opinion provided by Professor Fabien Corral. According to the latter, CONELEC, CENACE, CATEG, PETROECUADOR and PETROCOMERCIAL *\"fell under the definition of agencies of the State, this being understood as part of the organization or set of agencies that make up the Public Administration and the State.\"67*\n\nILC Articles, Exhibit CLA30.\n\n*Jan de Nul N. V. and Dredging International N. V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* Award, dated 6 November 2008, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Exhibit RLA45\n\nSecond Report of Dr. F. Corral, dated 8 August 2011, submitted by Claimant, para. 23 (\"Corral Second Report\").\n\n113.\n\nClaimant argues that, under Article 4 of the ILC Articles, the conduct of CONELEC should be attributed to Respondent as CONELEC is an organ of the Ecuadorian State.68 According to Claimant, Article 225(1) of the Ecuadorian Constitution of 2008 describes CONELEC as an entity *\"created by the Constitution or the Law for exercising governmental authority in order to provide public services or to develop activities assumed by the Government.\"69* Claimant also notes that CONELEC is an entity created *\"and controlled by\"* the State solely to discharge the State\u2019s electricity regulatory function, and that CONELEC is forbidden to engage in commercial activities.70\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 11.\n\nConstitution of Ecuador, dated 20 October 2008, Exhibit CLA74.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 35.\n\n114.\n\nClaimant further contends that, even if CONELEC were not formally an organ of Respondent, its conduct would be still attributed to Respondent under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, Article 225(1) of the Ecuadorian Constitution, Articles 13(a), 13(i) and 39 of the Power Sector Regime Law, and in light of its entitlement to exercise elements of governmental authority and its conduct, which also reflects its legal and regulatory function.71 As examples of such conduct, Claimant refers, in particular, to *\"(i) its granting* *a concession to Ulysseas to enter into and participate in a regulated sector; (ii) its participation in the setting market wide tariffs and altering the collection priority waterfall; and (iii) its acting in the State\u2019s shoes in stepping in and seizing control of a vessel in order to generate at a declared \u2018time of emergency* \u2019.\"72 Claimant also refers to the Interim Award, where the Tribunal contended that the conduct of CONELEC may be attributed to the State insofar as it exercises *\"puissance publique\",* which, in Claimant\u2019s opinion, was the case in all instances relevant to the present matter.73\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 11-13. Claimant refers to The Power Sector Regime Law, *supra* note 7.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 35(c).\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 35(d). Claimant refers to the Interim Award as well as *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction, dated 22 April 2005, ICSID Case No.ARB/03/3, Exhibit RLA6 to note that the bar set in the case was at the high water mark; and to *Bayindir Insaat Turizim Ticaret Ve Sanayi A. S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction, dated 14 November 2005, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Exhibit CLA97 *(\"When an investor invokes a breach of a BIT by the host State, the alleged treaty violation is by definition an act of \u2018puissance publique. \"\u2019)*\n\n115.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the PBII Contract is not a commercial agreement, but rather a permit to allow certain regulated activities to be performed. Claimant refers to the clause regarding the purpose of the contract, to the 1996 Power Sector Regime Law, and to the prohibition against CONELEC engaging in commercial activity in the electricity sector as evidence against ascribing a commercial character to the PBII Contract.74\n\nStatement of Reply, paras. 16-19.\n\n116.\n\nWith respect to CENACE, Claimant asserts that this administrative entity should be considered an \"institution of the State\" under the Ecuadorian Constitutions of 1998 and 2008 and that it is specifically empowered to discharge the State\u2019s functions under the 1996 Power Sector Regime Law.75\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 11; Statement of Reply, para. 37.\n\n117.\n\nClaimant also notes that PETROCOMERCIAL is a subsidiary of the State oil company PETROECUADOR, which is wholly owned by Respondent. Claimant submits that, given the terms of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, entities that are entirely held or controlled by the State cannot fail to give rise to liability on the part of Respondent when such entities exercise *\"any regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority that Respondent has delegated to it\"* Claimant also asserts that PETROCOMERCIAL was created for the specific purpose of serving as the State oil company and the sole supplier of fuel under the *Fuel for Power* scheme and therefore it amounts to an instrumentality of the State.76 Claimant thus argues that the conduct of both PETROCOMERCIAL and PETROECUADOR should be attributed to Respondent, if not as organs of the Ecuadorean State, then under Article 5 of the ILC Articles due to the exercise of governmental authority.77\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 38; *Defense Industry of State X v. European Company,* Interim Award, dated 15 August 1991, ICC Case No. 6465, Exhibit CLA105, p. 29.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 14-15.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s contentions**\n-------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant\u2019s efforts to attribute the conduct of CENACE, CATEG, PETROCOMERCIAL and, in particular, CONELEC to the State of Ecuador are without basis in international law.\n\n119.\n\nRelying first on the on the Interim Award, Respondent argues that CONELEC is not an organ of the State and that, therefore, Article 4 of the ILC Articles does not apply to it.78 On the contrary, in Respondent\u2019s view, the provision of the ILC Articles governing whether the actions of CONELEC are attributable to Respondent is Article 5. Accordingly, the Respondent submits, the Parties\u2019 dispute on attribution is in reality confined to whether CONELEC was exercising *puissance publique* when it performed the actions complained of by Claimant. Relying on the decision in *Impregilo v. Pakistan,* among other sources, Respondent argues that Claimant would need to prove that the acts in question involved an *\"activity beyond that of an ordinary contracting party (\u2018puissance publique).\"79*\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 216. Respondent points to the Interim Award, para. 156, referring to CONELEC: *\"Ecuador has created a special entity with separate legal personality, having its own assets and resources, capable of suing and being sued and entrusted with functions and powers to regulate the electricity sector on behalf of the Stale.\"*\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 218-220; *Impregilo S.p.A v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, supra* note 73, para. 266(b); *Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic,* Award, dated 6 February 2007, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/08, Exhibit CLA64; *Biwater Gauff fTanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania,* Award, dated 24 July 2008, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Exhibit RLA7.\n\n120.\n\nRespondent submits that the *\"fundamental nature\"* of the PBII Contract asserted by Claimant is irrelevant for the purposes of establishing attribution. Referring to *Jan de Nul* v. *Egypt* and to *Suez v. Argentina,* Respondent contends that in both cases the nature of the contract was not considered as the applicable test for determining whether the actions in question were an exercise of *puissance publique,80*\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, paras. 64-67; *Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, supra* note 66; *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales de Agua, S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Liability, dated 30 July 2010, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Exhibit RLA21.\n\n121.\n\nRespondent further contends that Article 12 of the 1996 Power Sector Regime Law does not prevent CONELEC from using private law mechanisms, *\"as plainly evidenced in the Licence Contract,\"* to discharge its duties.81 In Respondent\u2019s opinion, *\"that provision means only that CONELEC may not enter the power generation, distribution or transmission businesses, but does not speak to the governmental or commercial character of CONELEC\u2019s specific actions.\"82*\n\nArticle 12 of the Power Sector Regime Law 1996, *supra* note 7: \"CONELEC shall not exercise corporate activities in the electric sector\" *(\"no ejercer\u00e1 actividades empresariales en el sector el\u00e9ctrico.\").*\n\nRPHS, para. 18.\n\n122.\n\nIn sum, Respondent argues, CONELEC\u2019s actions amount merely to an exercise of the remedies available to it under the PBII Contract, governed by the Ecuadorian Civil Code. In exercising such remedies, Respondent contends CONELEC acted like any contracting party - *\"by refusing to release the Claimant from its contractual obligations\" -* when it declined to accept Claimant\u2019s request to terminate the PBII Contract. The imposition of fines for non-performance, Respondent notes, was specifically stipulated in the Licence Contract and, when taking control over PBII, CONELEC was employing enforcement powers available to it under the PBII Contract. In addition, Respondent claims that the decision to temporarily administer PBII was not based on Presidential Decree No. 124, but was made pursuant to Article 22 of the PBII Contract.83\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, paras. 70-76.\n\n123.\n\nIn short, CONELEC *\"was acting as a party to the PBII Contract*,\"84 Respondent also notes that Resolution 089/2009, through which CONELEC ordered the temporary administration of PBII, states in its Recitals and Articles that it is based on *\"contractual non compliance\"85*\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 1026: 23-24.\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 1029: 2-3.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis and conclusion**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nBoth Parties have made reference in this regard to the ILC Articles and to Article II(2)(b) of the BIT. The latter provides that *\"[e]ach Party shall ensure that any state enterprise that it maintains or establishes acts in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party\u2019s obligations under this Treaty wherever such enterprise exercises any regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority that the Party has delegated to it, such as the power to expropriate, grant licences, approve commercial transactions, or impose quotas, fees or other charges\"*\n\n125.\n\nClaimant has made reference to a number of entities of the Ecuadorian State, specifically CONELEC, the Minister of Electricity, CENACE, CATEG, PETROCOMERCIAL and PETROECUADOR, holding that their conduct is attributable to Respondent as organs of the Ecuadorian State according to Article 4 of the ILC Articles or as exercising governmental authority according to Article 5 of the ILC Articles and Article II (2)(b) of the BIT.86\n\nStatement of Reply, paras. 34-38.\n\n126.\n\nArticle 4(2) of the ILC Articles provides that \"[a]// *organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\"* Other decisions in investment treaty cases have confirmed that to determine whether an entity is a State organ one must look to the State\u2019s domestic law.87\n\nSee *Jan de Nul N. V. and Dredging International N. V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, supra* note 66, para. 160.\n\n127.\n\nWith the exception of the Minister of Electricity, who is obviously an organ of the Ecuadorian State, all other entities mentioned by Claimant (the \"Entities\") enjoy separate legal personality, have their own assets and resources to meet their liabilities. It remains to be determined whether each of CONELEC, CENACE, CATEG, PETROECUADOR and PETROCOMERCIAL is an organ of the Ecuadorian State or, in the negative, whether in its relations with Claimant it has exercised *\"regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority\"* delegated to it by the Ecuadorian State.88\n\nInterim Award, para. 156.\n\n128.\n\nThe circumstance that under the Ecuadorian legal system, both the Constitution of 1998 and that of 2008 define all Entities as part of the public sector in the area related to electric power89 is not *per se* sufficient to attribute their conduct to the State as the latter\u2019s organs. The Tribunal has already indicated that CONELEC is not an organ of the Ecuadorian State.90\n\nCorral Second Report, *supra* note 67, para. 7. According to Professor Corral, his report *\"does not try to cover or analyze public international law\"* (para. 2).\n\nInterim Award, para. 154.\n\n129.\n\nCONELEC (The National Electricity Council - *El Consejo Nacional de Electricidad)* is a legal entity created by law, with the objective of regulating and controlling electric power activity, issuing generally binding rules, imposing legal, regulatory and contractual penalties for violations in the electric power matters, exercising the functions of granting authority in the name of the State, taking decisions with respect to taking over, termination, extension of concessions, licenses and permits.91\n\nCorral Second Report, para. 8.\n\n130.\n\nCENACE (The National Energy Control Center - *El Centro Nacional de Control de Energia),* according to the Power Sector Regime Law (which defines it as a *\"non-profit corporation subject to the civil code\u2019),* performs tasks related to the exercise of the State\u2019s regulatory power with respect to the WEM by exercising market control and by carrying out activities for the safeguard of safety conditions of the operation of the National Interconnected System and the preservation of the overall efficiency of the sector, as well as for the control of the operation of generation facilities.92\n\nCorral Second Report, para. 9.\n\n131.\n\nCATEG (Corporation for the Temporary Administration of Electric Power of Guayaquil- *Corporaci\u00f3n para la Administraci\u00f3n Temporal El\u00e9ctrica de Guayaquil),* created by Executive Decree No. 712 of 18 August 2003 as a private non-profit organization, performs activities relating to the distribution and marketing of electric power in the city of Guayaquil.93\n\nCorral Second Report, paras. 12-13.\n\n132.\n\nPETROECUADOR, the State-owned company P\u00e9troleos del Ecuador, created by Law No. 45 of 26 September 1989 with legal personality and its own assets, performs activities that are directly related to the exercise of the State powers in the petroleum sector referred to in Article 247 of the 1998 Constitution.94\n\nCorral Second Report, para. 14.\n\n133.\n\nPETROCOMERCIAL, a State-owned company affiliated with PETROECUADOR, was created under the same Special Law which created PETROECUADOR, which provided also for the creation of first-tier subsidiaries for marketing and transportation activities in the petroleum sector.95\n\nCorral Second Report, para. 15.\n\n134.\n\nAll Entities are subject to a system of controls under the 1998 Constitution, which is exercised by the Office of the Comptroller General of Ecuador as to their revenues, expenses and investments and the utilization and custody of public property96. The 2008 Constitution reinforced the public nature of the Entities by providing that they *\"shall operate as companies subject to public law...\"* and that *\"the State shall always hold a majority of the stock for the participation in the management of the strategic sector and provisions of public services.\"97*\n\nCorral Second Report, para. 16\n\nCorral Second Report, paras. 19 and 22 (iii); 2008 Constitution, Article 315.\n\n135.\n\nThe circumstance that the Entities are part of the Ecuadorian public sector and are subject to a system of controls by the State in view of the public interests involved in their activity does not make them organs of the Ecuadorian State for the purposes of Article 4 of the ILC Articles. Each of the Entities may nonetheless fall within the purview of Article 5 of the ILC Articles and Article II(2)(b) of the BIT to the extent governmental authority has been delegated to it with the consequence that some of their acts can be attributed to the State, provided that they are *\"acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\"98*\n\nILC Articles, *supra* note 65, Article 5.\n\n136.\n\nClaimant\u2019s contentions regarding the conduct of the Entities show that, except in specific instances that shall be mentioned, none of them have exercised elements of governmental authority in their relations with Claimant, as indicated hereafter.\n\n137.\n\nCONELEC has exercised governmental authority delegated to it by Articles 2 and 3 of the Power Sector Regime Law when it granted the License. However, when it entered into the Licence Contract with Claimant regarding PBII and once the Licence Contract was executed, CONELEC\u2019s conduct in the contractual performance is to be evaluated on the basis of the contractual provisions accepted by Claimant when it signed the Licence Contract on 12 September 2006 and confirmed by it when the Licence Contract was amended on 6 June 2007.\n\n138.\n\nAs held by the tribunal in *Impregilo v. Pakistan,* only measures taken by the State \"i\" may come into consideration for purposes of attribution.99 Likewise, in *Jan de Nul v. Egypt* it was held that what matters is *\"not the \u2018service public \u2019 element but the use of \u2018pr\u00e9rogatives de puissance publique \u2019 or governmental authority. \"100*\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, supra* note 73, para. 143. It was similarly held in *Siemens A. G. v. The Argentine Republic, supra* note 79; *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania, supra* note 79.\n\n*Jan de Nul N.V and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, supra* note 66, paras. 166-167.\n\n139.\n\nThe circumstance that the Licence Contract is not a private law contract but rather an administrative contract, as asserted by Claimant,101 does not change this conclusion. As indicated by the Interim Award, the Licence Contract shows by its terms that only CONELEC, not the Ecuadorian State, is a contracting party.102 CONELEC\u2019s conduct is to be attributed only to it, not to the State of Ecuador, unless it uses governmental authority in its dealings with the investor. Claimant\u2019s claims mostly relate to contractual conduct, not to acts done by CONELEC outside of the Licence Contract as *\"puissance publique.\"* To the extent any such acts have been performed, outside the scope of the Licence Contract, CONELEC\u2019s conduct is attributable to the State according to Article 5 of the ILC Articles and Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.103 The subsequent analysis shall show that no claims for breach of the BIT may validly be asserted against Respondent by reason of CONELEC\u2019s exercise of its regulatory powers.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 19.\n\nInterim Award, paras. 157-161.\n\nThis is the case of Claimant\u2019s reference to the fact that CONELEC participated with the Minister of Energy and CENACE *\"in repeatedly altering the payment priority scheme to the detriment of private generators\" :* Statement of Reply, para. 35 (e)(i). However, Exhibit C77 referred to by Claimant in this context records a decision of a Commission of the Ministry of Energy of 7 June 2007, which does not involve CONELEC.\n\n140.\n\nCENACE\u2019s conduct, as the conduct of a public entity created and controlled by the Ecuadorian State, administering the technical and financial transactions under the WEM according to Article 23 of the Power Sector Regime Law, is attributable to the Ecuadorian State. Such conduct had limited impact on Claimant\u2019s activity considering that the latter has never operated in the WEM. The analysis that shall be further conducted below shows that no claims for breach of the BIT may be validly asserted against Respondent by reason of CENACE\u2019s exercise of its regulatory powers.\n\n141.\n\nCATEG was involved only regarding the failed attempt by Claimant to secure a PPA following Minister Mosquera\u2019s indication, in January 2008, that this Company would enter into such an agreement with Claimant at acceptable conditions. CATEG, as a separate juridical entity, did not consider itself bound by what had been indicated to Claimant by the Minister and declined to conclude a PPA with Claimant on the offered conditions. CATEG\u2019s acts, prompted as they were by purely commercial considerations, are not attributable to Respondent, as it will be further discussed.\n\n142.\n\nThe same conclusion applies to PETROECUADOR\u2019s and PETROCOMERCIAL\u2019s conduct, considering that no direct relations had been entertained by Claimant with such companies due to the absence of any power generating activity by PBII.104\n\nPETROCOMERCIAL provided fuel to Claimant which was used by PBI (Statement of Claim, para. 106), therefore outside the scope of the present dispute.\n\n143.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the acts performed by the Entities in their relations with Claimant or otherwise having an impact on its activities is attributable to Respondent.\n\n**C.** The Alleged Expropriation by Respondent of Claimant\u2019s Investment\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nClaimant submits that the expropriation of its assets by Respondent has taken two forms: a temporary expropriation, which consisted of a direct physical seizure of PBII for nearly a year, and an indirect expropriation, arising from Respondent\u2019s effective stripping of all economic value from Claimant\u2019s investment.105\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 102.\n\n**1. The Parties\u2019 positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n(i) *Temporary expropriation*\n-----------------------------\n\na. Claimant\u2019s contentions\n-------------------------\n\n145.\n\nAs to the temporary expropriation, Claimant states that Respondent took control of PBII against Claimant\u2019s wishes, and therefore deprived Claimant of both the use of PBII and the enjoyment of its benefits.106 Although PBII was ultimately returned, Claimant refers to the decision in *Wena Hotels Ltd v. Arab Republic of Egypt,*107 in which the tribunal found that a temporary expropriation had taken place when Egypt seized the investors\u2019 hotel for a period of approximately one year, such deprivation being sufficient to constitute expropriation as it was *\"more than an ephemeral interference in the use of that property or in the enjoyment of its benefits\"108*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 104.\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* Award, dated 8 December 2000, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Exhibit CLA29.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 103.\n\n146.\n\nClaimant alleges that, although Respondent ultimately returned PBII, it made no effort to restore it to its original condition prior to the seizure. Claimant also submits that the offer of compensation (approximately US$2 million) did not amount to *\"prompt, adequate and effective compensation\"109* In any event, Claimant argues that no payment was actually made, due to the concerted and coordinated efforts of CONELEC and PETROCOMERCIAL.110\n\nTranscript Day 1, p. 55: 6-15: \"They rely upon the fact they paid some indemnity, but the standard for indemnity under Ecuadorian law is not the standard for compensation for expropriation under international law, and they don't allege that it is. The evidence shows that the value of the property taken was substantially higher than that provided by the State.\"\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 105-106.\n\n147.\n\nFinally, Claimant considers that Respondent\u2019s conduct violated not only Respondent\u2019s international law obligations, but also its contractual commitments to maintain a stable legal environment in which the barge was to operate.111 Claimant notes that both as a matter of international law and Ecuadorian law, *\"the responsible State may not rely on the provisions of its internal law as justification for failure to comply with its obligations.\"112*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 107(b).\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 107(a); VCLT, Article 27, Exhibit CLA5; ILC Articles, *supra* note 65, Article 32.\n\nb. Respondent\u2019s contentions\n---------------------------\n\n148.\n\nRespondent contends that there has been no temporary expropriation because: (i) CONELEC\u2019s actions were those of a contracting party and cannot amount to expropriation; (ii) the Temporary Administration did not deprive Claimant of any economic value, but to the contrary created value for Claimant; (iii) CONELEC\u2019s actions were fully justified under the Licence Contract and Ecuadorian Law and (iv) Claimant did not lose its control, use and enjoyment of PBII during the Temporary Administration.113\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 228. See also RPHS, para. 36.\n\n149.\n\nRespondent first claims that CONELEC is not an organ of the State and, therefore, that only its actions that fall within the ambit of Article 5 of the ILC Articles are attributable to Respondent. In particular, Respondent asserts that a breach of contract does not amount to expropriation under international law if the State is acting as a contracting party. In Respondent\u2019s view, CONELEC merely acted in accordance with the Licence Contract. Even if its actions had been in breach of the Licence Contract, however, they did not constitute an exercise of governmental authority and are not attributable to Respondent.114\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 260-267; *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania, supra* note 79; *Impregilo S.p.A v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, supra* note 73; *Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States,* Award, dated 30 April 2004, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3 (NAFTA), Exhibit RLA23; *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* Award, dated 14 July 2006, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Exhibit CLA62.\n\n150.\n\nSecond, Respondent insists that the Claimant suffered no deprivation because it was Claimant that persistently refused to operate PBII or to cooperate with CONELEC and the Temporary Administrator. According to Respondent, Claimant refused to act as CONELEC\u2019s delegate operator or to resume the operation of PBII. Claimant also refused to accept the return of PBII for more than six months and to cooperate with CONELEC in securing a joint inspection of PBII.115\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 268-275.\n\n151.\n\nThird, Respondent claims that CONELEC\u2019s measures were justified under Article 22 of the Licence Contract as well as under the 1996 Power Sector Regime Law and the Concessions Regulations. The powers to take possession of PBII if Claimant refused to generate power was expressly provided for by Ecuadorian law, as incorporated by reference into the Licence Contract.\n\n152.\n\nIn any event, citing *LG&E v. Argentina* and *Gustav F WHamester v. Ghana,* Respondent submits that, as a rule, only an interference that is permanent can constitute expropriation. In its opinion, this is especially true if the intervention is made for the purposes of keeping *\"the Concession alive\",* as noted by the tribunal in *Gemplus.* Respondent further refers to **Wena Hotels,** whose facts are not, in its opinion, analogous. Respondent further argues that **Wena Hotels,** relied upon by Claimant, is distinguishable on the facts, as Egypt did not dispute that the actions of the State tourism holding company were wrong. In Respondent\u2019s opinion, however, not only did CONELEC act within the express terms of the Licence Contract, but *\"there was no question here of any interruption of business when CONELEC took over the Temporary Administration. CONELEC was merely giving effect to the purpose of the Licence Contract,\"116*\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 276-282; *LG&E v. Argentina,* Decision on Liability, dated 3 October 2006, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Exhibit RLA18; *Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana,* Award, dated 18 June 2010, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Exhibit RLA9; *Gemplus S. A. and Talsud S. A. v. United Mexican States,* Award, dated 16 June 2010, ICSID Case Nos. ARB(AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4, Exhibit RLA27; *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, supra* note 107.\n\n153.\n\nFinally, Respondent contends that Claimant delivered PBII *\"voluntarily and was paid for its use\"* during the Temporary Administration. Respondent insists that Claimant was free to retake and operate PBII at any time but *\"persistently refused to do so.\"117* In addition, Respondent accuses Claimant of having deliberately and unreasonably delayed the return of PBII by six months, which resulted in the extension of the Temporary Administration until the end of the electricity emergency, due to expire on 7 May 2010. PBII was thereafter at Claimant\u2019s disposal for more than four months until Claimant chose to receive it on 27 September 2010.118\n\nRPHS, para. 36.\n\nRPHS, paras. 36-39.\n\n(ii) *Indirect expropriation*\n-----------------------------\n\na. Claimant\u2019s contentions\n-------------------------\n\n154.\n\nClaimant also alleges that Respondent took measures which are tantamount to expropriation. Claimant refers to the *Metalclad* and *Revere Cooper* cases. According to the decision in *Metalclad,* expropriation also covers *\"covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\"119*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 108; *Metalclad Corp. v. Mexico,* Award, dated 30 August 2000, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l, Exhibit CLA28; *Revere Copper & Brass Inc. v. Overseas Private Investment Corp,* (1978), 17 Int\u2019l Legal Materials 1321, Exhibit CLA6.\n\n155.\n\nClaimant argues that the changes in the regulatory framework introduced by Respondent left Claimant with only one choice: generate at a loss or hand over control to Respondent. Claimant further asserts that, as a consequence of the damage Respondent inflicted on PBII, Claimant is no longer able to generate at all: \"[Claimant] *got back a broken vessel requiring several million dollars worth of repairs. This amounts to expropriation [...] under the Wena Hotel principles. It is not a temporary expropriation. Ecuador has permanently deprived Ulysseas of an essential component of the vessel as it was, i.e. its functionality\"120* In Claimant\u2019s view, this course of action amounts to an indirect expropriation.121\n\nTranscript Day 1, p. 44: 1-7.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 111.\n\n156.\n\nAccording to Claimant, at the time of the seizure PBII was in operating condition.122 It accuses Respondent of having failed to properly perform the running-in program, which resulted in the damages to the barge.123 Claimant also contends that the damage found by MAN when it inspected PBII and Mr. Salazar\u2019s statement are consistent with the engines having been run with low heavy-fuel-oil temperatures.124\n\nCPHS, paras. 30-32.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 33-36.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 37-40\n\n157.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant notes the logbook entries for 11 and 12 March 2010, which indicate that Engine No 3 reached unsafe levels of 577\u00b0 and 610\u00b0. Mr. Lasluiza, Respondent\u2019s witness, contended during the hearing that those levels had to be a *\"typing mistake\".125* Claimant states that such evidence *\"places the Tribunal in a difficult position: either Termopichincha was operating the engines well outside their parameters* [...] or *they could not be trusted to fill in simple and basic data in logs\"126*\n\nTranscript, Day 4, p. 758:8-9.\n\nCPHS, paras. 41-45.\n\n158.\n\nClaimant argues that, as a result of those actions, it has suffered a substantial deprivation in that it has lost the entire value of its investment. Claimant contends that Respondent\u2019s actions deprived Claimant of any expectation of either generating accounts receivable that had any reasonable prospect of collection. Claimant emphasizes that it could not even recover a sum that would at least cover its upfront costs. Claimant also notes that it was unable to find a buyer willing to step into its shoes in the surrounding circumstances.127\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 81.\n\n159.\n\nIn considering the question of whether there has been a *\"substantial deprivation\"* of its investment, Claimant first relies on *Suez v. Argentina* and *CMS v. Argentina,* according to which \" *\u2018the essential question is to establish whether the enjoyment of the property has been effectively neutralized, \u2019 because \u2018the standard where indirect expropriation is contended is that of substantial deprivation.* \"\u2019128 After questioning the relevance of *\"a 1934 State-State arbitration case\"* mentioned by Respondent (referring to *Oscar Chinn),* Claimant insists that this is not a case of making bad business decisions, but a situation where Claimant\u2019s investment has been plunged into a legal and regulatory regime which did not allow it to operate so as to recover its reasonable costs or generate return.129\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 80; *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales de Agua S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic, supra* note 80.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 82.\n\n160.\n\nIn relation to the contention by Respondent that similarly situated entities had been able to make a profit, Claimant sustains that no proof has been offered by Respondent to support this allegation. In addition, Claimant states that press reports seem to tell *\"a very different story\"* Claimant refers to *Noble Energy Inc. v. Ecuador,* in which it was recorded that the generator was not operating at a profit, and to Mr. Veldwijk\u2019s report, in which he states that he was receiving similar information in relation to Termoguayas. Claimant also cites *Duke v. Ecuador* and *Noble v. Ecuador,* where the claimants, who had entered into contracts with Ecuador, struggled to obtain any collections.130\n\n*Id.,* para. 82; *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador,* Award, dated 18 August 2008, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Exhibit RLA2; *Noble Energy Inc. andMachalapower CIA. LTDA v. Ecuador and Consejo Nacional de Electricidad,* Decision on Jurisdiction, dated 5 March 2008, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/12, Exhibit RLA3.\n\n161.\n\nClaimant also argues that Respondent fails to offer any proof that discussions were entered into between Claimant and distribution companies to enter into a PPA or any evidence that those discussions broke down due to Claimant\u2019s unreasonableness.131 Claimant states that *\"all of the Claimant\u2019s proposals were rejected by the distributors (all state-owned), without any counter-offer or further effort to reach agreeable terms\"132*\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 86.\n\nCPHS, para. 18.\n\n162.\n\nFinally, Claimant refutes Respondent\u2019s contention that it cannot complain that it has been substantially deprived of the value of its investment because *\"it voluntarily agreed under the PBII Contract to keep the Barge in Ecuador for 15 years\"* Claimant notes the entry into the PBII Contract was premised on the assumption that CONELEC would ensure that its end of the bargain was upheld, *\"which did not happen\"133*\n\nStatement of Reply, paras. 83-84.\n\nb. Respondent\u2019s contentions\n---------------------------\n\n163.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, there was no indirect expropriation because Respondent did not radically or substantially deprive Claimant of the economic value of PBII. According to Respondent, in order to establish indirect expropriation Claimant must prove, *inter alia,* that (i) Respondent has deprived Claimant of the value of PBII and (ii) such deprivation cannot be justified as an instance of reasonable regulation.134\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 229.\n\n164.\n\nAs to the *\"substantial deprivation\"* requirement, Respondent notes that (i) *\"substantial deprivation\"* is a demanding standard which is not met here, (ii) the lack of feasibility of Claimant\u2019s purported PBII project was not due to any actions of Respondent and (iii) Respondent acted reasonably in connection with PBII.135\n\n*Id.,* para. 229\n\n165.\n\nWith regard to the applicable standard, Respondent relies, *inter alia,* on *Glamis Gold v. United States* to explain that *\"deprivation\"* entails a high threshold of interference by the host State. Respondent refers to *LG&E v. Argentina, Enron v. Argentina* and *CMS v. Argentina* in order to show that investment tribunals have consistently held that there is no expropriation when the investor continues to enjoy the ownership or control of the investment.136\n\n*Id.,* paras. 230-234; *Glamis Gold v. United States of America,* Award, dated 8 June 2009, UNCITRAL, Exhibit RLA10; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic,* Award, dated 22 May 2007, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Exhibit RLA16; *CMS v. Argentine Republic,* Award, dated 12 May 2005, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Exhibit RLA17; *LG&E v. Argentine Republic, supra* note 116.\n\n166.\n\nRespondent also argues that, even if Respondent\u2019s actions had diminished the expected profitability of Claimant\u2019s investment, this would not amount to direct or indirect expropriation. Respondent refers to several cases, including *Occidental v. Ecuador, Waste Management* and *Oscar Chinn,* where tribunals held that *\"substantial deprivation\"* was not present despite a finding that economic profitability had been interfered with. Respondent also claims that Claimant\u2019s reliance on **Revere Copper** is misplaced. Respondent contends that in **Revere Copper** a newly elected government increased the royalties to be paid by the investor so drastically that it ceased operating. However, in Respondent\u2019s view, there has been no repudiation of the Licence Contract in this case: on the contrary, CONELEC just insisted that Claimant abide by the terms of the Licence Contract and operate PBII.137\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 234-242; *Case concerning Oscar Chinn (UK v. Belgium),* Judgement, PCIJ Ser.A/B No. 63, dated 12 December 1934, Exhibit RLA20; *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales de Agua S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic, supra* note 80; *Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States, supra* note 114; *Metalclad Corp. v. Mexico, supra* note 119; and *Revere Copper & Brass Inc.* v. *Overseas Private Investment Corp, supra* note 119.\n\n167.\n\nRespondent notes that the burden of proof in establishing an expropriation lies with Claimant and asserts that Claimant has failed to satisfy its burden because it has offered no proof that it would only have been able to operate PBII at a loss. Moreover, Respondent argues that Mr. Veldwijk\u2019s witness statement concedes that Claimant could have at least achieved \"break even.\"138\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 243-245; *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine,* Award, dated 26 July 2007, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Exhibit RLA24.\n\n168.\n\nEven if Claimant can establish that it was somehow deprived of the value of PBII, Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim would in Respondent\u2019s view still fail because Respondent did not cause such deprivation.139 Respondent argues that Claimant cannot meet the stringent burden of a *\"suitable causal link\",* as set out in *Olguin v. Paraguay,140* Respondent also disputes that Claimant\u2019s complaint that the amount paid by CONELEC was insufficient and states that Claimant had never indicated that the amount was inadequate.141\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 247.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 248-250; *Tradex Hellas S.A. v. Republic of Albania,* Award, dated 29 April 1999, ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2, Exhibit RLA25; *Otis Elevator Company v. Iran,* Award, Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, dated 29 April 1987, Case No. 294, Exhibit RLA15 and *Olguin v. Republic of Paraguay,* Award, dated 26 July 2001, ICSID Case No. AB/98/5, Exhibit RLA26.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 89.\n\n169.\n\nAccording to Respondent, PBII simply turned out to be less profitable than expected due to Claimant\u2019s own conduct. It contends that Claimant incurred wasteful and illegitimate expenditures when attempting to install the barge in Puerto Hondo and Santa Elena without approval, and that it failed to secure a PPA - resulting in further problems, including a worse position in the payment priority order - because of its insistence on unreasonable terms.142 Respondent also notes that CONELEC terminated the PBII Licence Contract on 17 March 2011.143 As to the complaint by Claimant that it could not find a buyer for PBII, Respondent says that \"it is absurd\" and argues that Claimant cannot complain of deprivation on the basis that it still possesses its investment.144\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 251.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 82.\n\n*Id.,* para. 82.\n\n170.\n\nFurther, Respondent claims that, even if it was proved that its actions deprived the PBII project of all value, Claimant would fail to demonstrate that it was the entity which suffered as a result. Respondent asserts that Proteus Power, as charterer, was the entity with the right to have *\"exclusive use, dominion, control, possession and command of* [PBII],\" and as such the only party who could claim damages.145 As to the Claimant\u2019s complaints regarding the conduct of CONELEC in \"compounding\" the expropriation, Respondent argues (i) that CONELEC\u2019s actions are again not attributable to Respondent, (ii) that Claimant willingly entered into a fifteen year contract for the operation of PBII and (iii) that \"there is no support in arbitral practice for the proposition that a contractual party\u2019s insistence on the specific performance of a contract can amount to expropriation by the host State.\"146\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 253.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 254; *Gemplus S.A. and Talsud S.A. v. United Mexican States, supra* note 116.\n\n171.\n\nWith regard to the second requirement for indirect expropriation stated by Respondent -the need to establish that the regulatory measures were unreasonable - Respondent argues that all the measures were taken for a public purpose, namely, addressing the payment problems and promoting the efficiency of the power sector. Respondent relies on *Methanex v. USA,* where the Tribunal found there was no expropriation because the ban of a gasoline additive was adopted for a public purpose, and concludes there has been no indirect expropriation here either.147\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 258; *Methanex v. United States,* Award, dated 3 August 2005, UNCITRAL, Exhibit RLA28.\n\n**2. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis and conclusion**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nArticle III(l) of the BIT states that *\"investment shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (\u2018expropriation\u2019).\"* According to Claimant, Respondent has breached this Article by expropriating its investment.\n\n(i) *Temporary expropriation*\n-----------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe temporary expropriation, one of the two forms of expropriation of its investment alleged by Claimant, would have consisted in the physical seizure of PBII for nearly a year.148 This action would have deprived Claimant of the use and enjoyment of PBII and its benefits, thus violating Article III (1) of the BIT by expropriating its investment, PBII.149 The offer of compensation for approximately US$ 2 million does not amount to a *\"prompt adequate and effective compensation\"* under said scenario.150 This head of Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim may not be accepted for the following reasons.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 102.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 104.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 106.\n\n174.\n\nCONELEC\u2019s seizure of PBII in 2009 was not an expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment but the exercise by CONELEC of the power recognized to it under Ecuadorian law151 and Article 22 of the Licence Contract (which refers to the Concessions Regulations).152 This Article entitles CONELEC\u2019s to intervene in the Licence Contract by, among other actions, taking temporary possession of the licensee\u2019s assets in case of failure by Claimant to commence power generating activity within the agreed time limit.\n\nPower Sector Regime Law, **supra** note 7, Article 13(m); Concessions Regulations, **supra** note 11.\n\nRespondent refers to Article 22 of the Licence Contract as the contractual basis for CONELEC\u2019s obligation to resort to the Temporary Administration of PBII by stating: *\"This obligation was expressly referenced and authorised by Article 22 of the Licence Contract\"* (Statement of Defence, para. 175; *Id.,* also para. 261).\n\n175.\n\nThe time-limit for commencing commercial operations had long since expired when CONELEC, in view of the insufficient electrical supply for the country, by letter of 24 September 2009 informed Claimant of its Board of Directors\u2019 Resolution *\"to declare that as of this date ULYSSEAS INC. is held to be in breach of contract due to the fact that commercial operation did not begin on the date established in the Permit Agreement and Amendment Agreement signed with this Council and in the duly authorized extensions...* \u2019\u2019(Article l).153\n\nLetter from CONELEC to Claimant, dated 24 September 2009 and enclosed Resolution No. 089/09 of the Board of Directors, Exhibit Cl29.\n\n176.\n\nCONELEC Board\u2019s Resolution offered Claimant to commence generation by operating PBII within 3 business days, failing which generation would be assumed by means of a third party (Articles 2 and 3). Claimant\u2019s refusal to act as temporary administration of the barge led CONELEC to temporarily assume generation activities by operating PBII. It so informed Claimant on 7 October 2009, designating CELEC, through Termopichincha, as temporary administrator of the barge. PBII was transferred to CELEC-Termopichincha for such Temporary Administration the following day. Claimant\u2019s continuing ownership over PBII and its right to compensation for the use of the property was recognised. The temporary loss of control of the barge is attributable to Claimant, considering also CONELEC\u2019s repeated invitations to Claimant to resume control of the barge to operate the same.\n\n177.\n\nUnder CONELEC Resolution 089/09 of 24 September 2009, PBII had to be administered temporarily and, in any case, not for more than six months. Claimant would have therefore regained possession of the barge as early as 25 March 2010. However, due to a number of reasons that, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion are not attributable only to Respondent, possession of the barge was regained by Claimant only at the end of September 2010. On 5 May 2010 CONELEC, in accordance with Article 9 of Resolution 089/09, authorised payment of USD 2,125,158.21 as compensation for the temporary use of PBII.154\n\nThe amount of compensation was not paid to Claimant but was withheld in favour of PETROCOMERCIAL due to the latter\u2019s entitlement to recover USD 2,007,812.27 for fuel purchased by Claimant for the operation of PBI *(supra* note 122).\n\n178.\n\nThe Temporary Administration of PBII was an action done by CONELEC in the exercise of a right granted under the Licence Contract in the presence of a breach by Claimant of its contractual obligation to generate electricity for 15 years. It was *\"the ordinary behaviour of a contractual counterparty\"*,155 therefore not an exercise of governmental authority as *\"puissance publique\"* attributable to the Ecuadorian State. As held by another award involving Ecuador,\n\n*\"Private contract parties can agree to empower one of them to impose sanctions on the other for unlawful performance of the contract. Such mutually agreed delegation of power derives from the parties\u2019 autonomy under the law of contracts. It must be distinguished from the power of the State to impose sanctions in the exercise of its sovereign power.\"156*\n\nTo use the words of the Award of 24 July 2008, in *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania supra* note 79, para. 492.\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador, supra* note 130.\n\n179.\n\nThe contractual nature of CONELEC\u2019s actions excludes the possibility that the Temporary Administration gave rise to an expropriation of Claimant\u2019s assets, and therefore to a violation by Respondent of Article III(l) of the BIT. This also entails that any claims asserted by Claimant in that regard, including for damages allegedly caused to the barge during the Temporary Administration, should be settled in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Licence Contract.\n\n(ii) *Indirect expropriation*\n-----------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe other form of expropriation of the investment claimed by Claimant relates to the alleged interference by the Ecuadorian State with the use of property, with the effect of *\"depriving the owner, in whole or in a significant part, of the use or reasonably to be expected economic benefit of property.\"157* According to Claimant, the changes in the regulatory framework introduced by Respondent left it with no other alternative than to generate at a loss, thus permanently depriving it of all expected economic benefit from its investment in Ecuador. This, in Claimant\u2019s view, amounts to an indirect expropriation.\n\nIn the words of the Award of 30 August 2000 in *Metalclad Corp. v. Mexico, supra* note 119, para. 103, referred to by Claimant (Statement of Claim, para. 108).\n\n181.\n\nThis *\"regulatory evisceration\",* as so characterised by Claimant, was compounded by Respondent, via CONELEC, holding it to its long-term concession agreement without allowing a risk mitigation by simply sailing away from Ecuador.158 To substantiate its claim, Claimant refers to arbitral cases where indirect expropriation has been said to exist when government measures entail a *substantial deprivation* of the investment or its economic benefits.159\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 109.\n\nStatement of Reply, paras. 79-80, referring (in para. 80) to the reasoning in *Suez v. Argentina, supra* note 80, relied upon also by Respondent (Statement of Defence, para. 237).\n\n182.\n\nThe *Suez v. Argentina* award, relied upon by Claimant, specifies that to effect a substantial deprivation the measures *\"must also be permanent\"160*\n\n*Suez* v. *Argentina, supra* note 80, para. 123.\n\n183.\n\nTwo changes in the regulatory framework in place at the time of its investment are mentioned in particular by Claimant in support of its claim for expropriation, both mentioned in the written statement of Mr. Jan Veldwijk, a witness for Claimant: (i) the changes in the priority regime in 2007 and 2008, making it impossible for Claimant *\"to generate electricity, sell it on the spot market, and actually receive money for doing so,\"* and (ii) the impossibility of reaching agreement to obtain a viable PPA (after two and-a-half years of fruitless negotiations) *\"as a consequence of the way the Respondent negotiated and the huge advantages of State-owned generation companies.* \"161 In addition, Respondent fined Claimant for not producing electricity and *\"capped the process by taking forced possession of PBII, then wrecking it. \"162*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 110.\n\n*Id.*\n\n184.\n\nThese aspects of Claimant\u2019s claim for indirect expropriation or for measures tantamount to expropriation have been confirmed by Claimant in further submissions,163 with some developments regarding the meaning of *substantial deprivation* (specifically, according to the tribunal in *Suez v. Argentina).* Claimant\u2019s alleged loss of the entire value of its investment is motivated by the circumstance that it could not generate electricity and have an expectation of being paid at least to cover its upfront costs or, alternatively, that it was not allowed to quit Ecuador and earn profits elsewhere or find a buyer for the barge.164 The discontinuance of the fuel credit system is alleged by Claimant as another cause of substantial deprivation of its investment.165 These various aspects of Claimant\u2019s claim will be examined in turn.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 76.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 81.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 82(a)(i).\n\n185.\n\nFines for Claimant\u2019s failure to produce electricity is a sanction that Claimant knew could be imposed by CONELEC under the Licence Contract (Article 16). This measure therefore is not attributable to Respondent for the same reason mentioned above regarding the Temporary Administration, namely that it was an action based on a contract and not an exercise of *puissance publique.* Moreover, the exercise of a contractual power by CONELEC may not amount to a breach of the BIT in the absence of proof that such exercise resulted in a violation of a specific standard of treatment. As to the *\"taking of forced possession of PBII,\"* the Tribunal has already excluded that the Temporary Administration of the barge is attributable to Respondent as a temporary expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment and, moreover, that it resulted in a breach of the BIT.166\n\n*Supra,* paras. 173-174.\n\n186.\n\nThe changes in the priority regime were not, in themselves or in combination with the lack of a viable PPA, the cause of such a substantial deprivation of the economic value of Claimant\u2019s investment as to amount to its indirect expropriation. The situation confronting Claimant in 2007 and 2008 was the consequence of the failure by power generators to be able to operate economically and to actually receive payment for the power generated by them due to the low-level end-user electricity tariff that had historically prevented the rates paid by consumers to be sufficient to cover the actual costs of power generation and transmission and allow for a reasonable return.\n\n187.\n\nClaimant, which had planned since 2003 to enter Ecuador to produce and sell electricity, was well aware of the State\u2019s efforts to regulate the power sector so as to ensure power generators\u2019 ability to sell at a price that was economic to their business. However, there was no guarantee of profitability of the regulatory system, as made clear, among other law provisions, by Article 40 of the Power Sector Regime Law of 1996, according to which *\"the Ecuadorian State shall not guarantee the production price or profitability of investment and market for electricity to any generator whatsoever.\"*\n\n188.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2009 a series of changes to the payment priority order were introduced. Claimant\u2019s complaint regarding changes in 2007 and 2008 is ill-founded since, based on the experience of the past, it had to expect these and possible further changes in the priority order for payment to private generators. Claimant has not proven the substantial deprivation of the value of its investment that would have been caused by these changes in the payment priority order. According to one of Respondent\u2019s witnesses, Ing J. Vergara, the 2007 change improved the prospects of collection of private generators selling to the spot market which continued to enjoy a high ranking, with only payments for the margin on spot sales ranking one level before the last one (similarly to 2006).167 There is no mention in the record of these proceedings of a change in 2008.168 According to Mr. Z. Korn, one of Claimant\u2019s witnesses, Claimant did not base its decision to sign the Licence Contract on a particular payment priority order.169\n\nRPHS, para. 8. Mr J. Vergara confirmed this at the hearing by stating: *\"There is this priority list, and there is a better improvement of the payment trust in 2007 and a better payment order in 2009. This has allowed all generators, especially private generators, to be paid in full for the invoices they submitted\"* (Transcript, Day 3, p. 581: 16-22).\n\nMu\u00f1oz Report, *supra* note 30, submitted by Claimant, does not mention a new payment priority order in 2008.\n\nMr. Z. Korn stated the following at the hearing: \"we were not so much inclined to worry about payment priorities... nobody presumed that being in a priority 3 or 4 meant you did not get paid or you would be paid less than what you were owed\" (Transcript, Day 2, pp. 265:19; 266:10). Mr. Korn also confirmed that Claimant was aware that \"many things kept on changing in Ecuador\" (Transcript, Day 2, p. 266; 5-6).\n\n189.\n\nThe evolutionary character of the changes in priority order due to the need to ensure a better stability of the electricity market condition deprives the alleged substantial deprivation of the value of Claimant\u2019s investment of the required *permanent* character.\n\n190.\n\nThe alleged impossibility to reach agreement for a commercially viable PPA cannot be imputed to Respondent. As a matter of fact, Claimant was unable to secure a PPA because it proposed price and other terms and conditions that no distribution company was willing to accept. This is confirmed by the fact that all generators, except Claimant, had secured viable PPAs.\n\n191.\n\nEven if some public authorities or officials might have given an expectation to Claimant by statements made in meetings that a viable PPA would be concluded by Claimant, the evidence in the file shows that no firm assurances had been given to Claimant in that regard.\n\n192.\n\nIn a meeting on 12 December 2007 with the Minister of Electricity, Mr. Alecksey Mosquera, the latter indicated to Claimant that it would recover its variable costs, its PPA sales price would be US$ 0,017 - US$ 0,018 above its declared variable costs and that it would receive US$ 9 million in free cash flow per annum.170 In a subsequent meeting with CONELEC\u2019s Executive Director, Mr. Fernando Izquierdo, the latter indicated an opportunity for Claimant to enter into a PPA with CATEG, a State entity wholly controlled by CONELEC, at a price that would allow to cover its costs and make a return. This was confirmed by Minister Mosquera in a meeting on 31 January 2008, stating that CATEG would enter into a PPA on the same terms granted to another power company, Termoguayas, and outlining the terms to be incorporated in a PPA.171\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 47 (b).\n\n*Id.,* para. 47 (c) (d).\n\n193.\n\nThe minutes of the meeting of 31 January 2008 with Minister Mosquera confirm what is stated by Claimant in this arbitration.172 Following the meeting, by letter of 25 February 2008. Claimant proposed the terms of a PPA to CATEG conforming to those indicated by Minister Mosquera.173 When viewed in the light of statements made by such high levels of authority in the electricity sector, Claimant\u2019s surprise in learning from CATEG that the latter was not available to enter into a PPA is understandable.174\n\nEmail from Mr. Mario Restrepo to Mr. John Hager, Mr. Jan Veldwijk and Mr. Robert Wells (including attachment), dated 4 Feb 2008, Exhibit C98. The content of these minutes is not disputed by Respondent, who makes reference to them (Statement of Rejoinder, note 68).\n\nLetter by Claimant to CATEG, dated 25 February 2008, Exhibit C100.\n\nLetter by CATEG to Claimant of 25 March 2008, Exhibit C101. This letter refers to Claimant\u2019s proposal for a PPA of 25 February 2008, so that Claimant\u2019s statement that it learnt of CATEG\u2019s impossibility to enter into a PPA *\"thatyear only after two months of serious negotiations\"* (Statement of Claim, para. 47(e)) is surprising. Moreover, as indicated by Claimant, already in a meeting of 7 February 2008, it had learnt from CATEG that the latter would not sign a PPA with Claimant (CPHS, Chart attached as Exhibit A).\n\n194.\n\nThe conduct of Minister Mosquera in these circumstances is not exempt from criticism for having created an expectation that Claimant would be able to conclude a PPA with CATEG on favourable commercial terms. However, further circumstances bear mentioning in that regard.\n\n195.\n\nFirstly, as shown by the minutes of the 31 January 2008 meeting (under point 4(f)), the Minister called CATEG in the presence of Claimant to schedule an appointment *\"to negotiate (and try to execute) the PPA under the conditions set forth herein.\"* This shows that there was no firm assurance that a PPA would be entered into with CATEG and, more specifically, on defined terms. Further, by letter of 6 March 2008, addressed to CATEG and Claimant, Minister Mosquera made it clear that CATEG was *\"free to negotiate and establish power purchasing contracts with the company that offers the best technical and economic conditions.\"175*\n\nLetter from Minister Mosquera to CATEG and Claimant dated 6 March 2008, Exhibit R151.\n\n196.\n\nIn its letter of 25 March 2008, CATEG mentions as the reason for declining Claimant\u2019s proposal for a PPA the fact that CONELEC\u2019s Regulation No. 002/07 of October 2007 had imposed *\"a severe limitation on the energy that CATEG may acquire under contracts with other generators.\"* Presumably when Claimant\u2019s proposal for a PPA was received by CATEG, the latter had already reached that limitation on the energy it might acquire. It is somewhat surprising that Minister Mosquera was unaware of this limitation when indicating to Claimant the prospects of a PPA with CATEG. This conduct, although lacking of the transparency and straightforwardness required from such a high level of authority when dealing with a foreign investor, is not sufficient *per se* to rise to the level of a breach of the BIT. It became in fact clear to Claimant in less than two month time after the meeting with Minister Mosquera that no PPA would be entered into with CATEG. Claimant\u2019s prejudice deriving from such conduct, if any, was therefore very limited.\n\n197.\n\nThe events that followed in 2009 do not support Claimant\u2019s assertion that it was unable to enter into a PPA for reasons attributable to Respondent. On 17 April 2009, the Ministry of Electricity invited all private generators, including Claimant, to negotiate PPAs with distribution companies, sending them Terms of Reference for such negotiations.176 According to the Terms of Reference, generators were required to submit their proposals by 23 April 2009. Claimant failed to submit a PPA proposal and was thus excluded from the negotiations for a PPA. All other private generators submitted PPA proposals and many of them had executed a PPA already in August 2009.\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Electricity to all private generators, dated 13 April 2009, Exhibit R261; Terms of Reference for Power Purchase Agreements between distribution companies and private generators, dated 9 April 2009, Exhibit R262.\n\n198.\n\nAccording to Mr. Jan Veldwijk, one of Claimant\u2019s witnesses, Claimant was concerned about the *\"trust fund'* mechanism as security for payment under a potential PPA.177 However, according to the priority order under the Payment Trusts of 25 June 2009, private generators with PPAs would rank among the first generators to be paid. All other private generators executed PPAs considering the trust fund to be an acceptable security for payment. Mr. Veldwijks\u2019s description of the various meetings held during the *\"Round Two PPA\"* negotiations shows that Claimant\u2019s reasons for not executing a PPA were purely commercial and that Claimant was never excluded from the relevant negotiations.178\n\nThird Witness Statement of Mr. Jan Veldwijk, CWS-12, para. 33.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 32-42. In an e-mail addressed to Mr. Jon Pollock and Mr. German Efromovich on December 8, 2009 regarding presentation to CONELEC of Claimant\u2019s financials in relation to a prospective PPA, Mr. Jan Veldwijk admits that *\"our numbers are significantly higher than some of the other provide, explainable through the additional costs we have incurred over the past years (US$ 25 Million) and the high value of our barge\"* (Exhibit C139). More than one year before, the CEO of a distribution company, Empresa El\u00e9ctrica Regional El Oro S.A., replying on April 16, 2008 to an offer for a PPA submitted by Claimant, stated: *\"After performing this analysis, we have concluded that the price offered by ULYSSEAS, INC. is not in the interest of the institution 1 represent\"* (Exhibit Cl 6).\n\n199.\n\nThe fact that Claimant was not allowed to quit Ecuador may not be imputed to Respondent considering that it had undertaken to produce electricity for fifteen years under freely accepted contractual conditions by entering into the PBII Contract and that under the PBII Contract termination without sanction could only come about by mutual agreement (Article 17.2). Likewise, the failure to find a buyer for PBII may not be imputed to Respondent. As to the alleged discontinuance of fuel credits, the analysis that will be made hereafter will show the lack of merit also of this argument for a substantial deprivation of its investment alleged by Claimant.179\n\nMore will be said on the subject when dealing with the attempted sale of PBII to Termoesmeraldas *(infra,* para. 321).\n\n200.\n\nIn conclusion, whether considered in isolation or by their combined effects, the reasons alleged by Claimant do not constitute a sufficient basis for the claimed *substantial deprivation* of the value of its investment resulting in its indirect expropriation or in measures tantamount to expropriation.\n\n201.\n\nIn the light of all the foregoing reasons, Claimant\u2019s claim of expropriation of its investment must be dismissed.\n\n**D.** The Alleged Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties\u2019 positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n(i) *The level of protection under the BIT*\n-------------------------------------------\n\na. Claimant\u2019s contentions\n-------------------------\n\n202.\n\nClaimant submits that there is a close nexus between legitimate expectations and fair and equitable treatment and states that the level of protection is at least that of customary international law, if not higher.180\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 73-77.\n\n203.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent breached its obligation under Article 11(3)(a) of the BIT to provide fair and equitable treatment. Claimant refers to the definition of fair and equitable treatment provided by the tribunal in *Tecmed,* according to which fair and equitable treatment means *\"treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment*,\"181 Claimant also relies on *Saluka, Siemens* and *Alpha v. Ukraine* for the idea that *\"governments must avoid* *arbitrarily changing the rules of the game in a manner that undermines the legitimate expectations of or the representations made to an investor.\"182*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 73; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA v. United Mexican States,* Award, dated 29 May 2003, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Exhibit CLA37.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 76; *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic,* Partial Award, dated 17 March 2006, Exhibit CLA60; *Siemens v. Argentina, supra* note 79; *Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award, dated 8 November 2010, Exhibit CLA82.\n\n204.\n\nWith reference to *EDF v. Romania* and *Duke v. Ecuador,* Claimant argues that it is widely accepted that the level of protection is at least that of customary international law, and that it may be higher depending on the context of the BIT in question.183 It also relies on the language of the Preamble to the BIT and on the observation made by Dolzer and Schreuer in their treatise, to conclude that the protection offered under the BIT is capable of supporting a promise of maintaining a stable legal and regulatory framework. As to Respondent\u2019s reliance on the 2004 US Model BIT and NAFTA, Claimant notes that the instant BIT entered into force prior to either of the other two instruments and contends that the specific language adopted in the NAFTA treaty renders it unhelpful in interpreting what the present BIT means.184\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 61(d); *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, dated 8 October 2009, Exhibit RLA35; *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A.* v. *Republic of Ecuador, supra* note 130.\n\nStatement of Reply, paras. 60-64.\n\nb. Respondent\u2019s contentions\n---------------------------\n\n205.\n\nRespondent argues that the BIT does not protect Claimant against commercial risk and accuses Claimant of distorting international law obligations to protect itself against the consequences of its own poor business decisions. Respondent also claims that international law only protects reasonable expectations based on legitimate investment, and only in the context of proscribing arbitrary measures.185\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 285.\n\n206.\n\nRespondent notes that Article II(3)(a) must be interpreted in light of the object and purpose of the BIT, in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention. In its view, and by relying on the decisions in *Occidental v. Ecuador* and *CMS v. Argentina,* and on the 2004 US Model Bilateral Investment Treaty, the fair and equitable treatment standard embodied in Article II(3)(a) does not establish a higher standard than the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.186 Respondent also refers to several cases where a showing of a serious misconduct - e.g. conduct that is *\"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory which exposes the claimant to sectional or rational prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial property\" -* was required in order to consider that the minimum standard of treatment had been breached.187\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 289-291; *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador,* Final Award, dated 1 July 2004, LCIA Case No. UN3467, Exhibit CLA49; *CMS Gas Transmission Co v. Argentine Republic, supra* note 136.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 293-296; *Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States, supra* note 114; *Saluka Investments BVv. Czech Republic, supra* note 182; *SD Myers v. Canada,* First Partial Award, dated 13 November 2000, UNCITRAL, Exhibit RLA31; *Mondev International Ltd. v. USA,* Award, dated 11 October 2002, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Exhibit RLA32.\n\n207.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, the authorities relied upon by Claimant support the position that, in any event, the content of the fair and equitable standard is *\"essentially the same\"* as the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. Respondent notes that, by the time Claimant was formed in February 2003, and before the execution of the Licence Contract in September 2006, both Ecuador and the United States *\"had settled harmonious views on the confined scope offair and equitable treatment\"188*\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 98; *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador, supra* note 130; *CMS Gas Transmission Co v Argentine Republic, supra* note 136; *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic, supra* note 114.\n\n208.\n\nRespondent claims that the fair and equitable treatment standard preserves the right of a host State to change the legal and regulatory framework applicable to an investment. In Respondent\u2019s view, the high threshold of this standard places the burden on the investor to proceed \"with awareness of the regulatory situation.\"189 Respondent submits that this view is supported by *Duke v. Ecuador* and *EDF v. Romania,* among other decisions. It also compares the case with *Parkerings-Compagniet v. Lithuania,* where the tribunal did not find any breach of the BIT despite Lithuania having introduced legislative modifications which had a negative impact on Claimant\u2019s investment.190 Respondent further contends that the legitimate expectations at the time an investor made its investment must be judged objectively. Respondent also recalls that, according to *EDF v.* *Romania* and to *Saluka,* the BIT was not intended to protect investors from unwise business decisions.191\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 298; *Grand River Enterprises et al. v. United States of America,* Award, dated 12 January 2011, UNCITRAL, Exhibit RLA33.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 101; *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v.

Romania, supra* note 183; *Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic, supra* note 182.\n\n(ii) *The date of the investment into Ecuador*\n----------------------------------------------\n\na. Claimant\u2019s contentions\n-------------------------\n\n209.\n\nClaimant is of the view that the effective date of the investment is 31 March 2003, the date of the importation of PBI into Ecuador.192\n\nStatement of Claim, para 80.\n\n210.\n\nClaimant contends it had been exploring the possibility of investing into Ecuador in 2002. Claimant claims that its legitimate expectation was formed during that period and crystallized by 31 March 2003 - when PBI was imported into Ecuador. For this purpose, it insists on the unitary nature of the investment, as conceived in *Holiday Inns v. Morocco.193* In Claimant\u2019s view, it was its legitimate expectation that the regulatory framework in place when it started to invest would remain stable and unchanged to the extent that it would be allowed to continue to receive a reasonable return on its investment.194 According to Claimant, PBI\u2019s importation *\"was the beginning part of a long-term series of acts, all of which would have individually qualified as an investment but which together certainly did\"195*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 79; *Holiday Inns v. Morocco,* Decision on Jurisdiction, dated 12 May 1974, ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1, Exhibit CLA4; *CSOB v. Slovakia,* Decision on Jurisdiction, dated 24 May 1999, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Exhibit CLA88; *Duke Energy v. Peru,* Decision on Jurisdiction, dated 1 February 2006, ICSID Case no. ARB/03/28, Exhibit CLA89.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 80.\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 906:16-17.\n\n211.\n\nClaimant asserts that, even if its position on the unity of the investment were not accepted, the latest date its legitimate expectations would have been fixed would be 16 April 2005, when PBII was imported into Ecuador. Claimant argues that its legitimate expectations, either formed in 2003 or 2005, were violated by Respondent.196\n\nStatement of Reply, paras. 72-73.\n\nb. Respondent\u2019s contentions\n---------------------------\n\n212.\n\nWith regard to the date when any legitimate expectations might have been formed, Respondent notes that Claimant did not exist in 2002 and was only incorporated on 26 February 2003. In Respondent\u2019s view, the relevant dates are those regarding PBII, since Claimant is not bringing any claim in relation to PBI.197 Respondent argues thus that the relevant date is 12 September 2006, when Claimant executed the PBII Licence Contract and *\"its investment in PBII as a power generating plant crystallised\"198* Respondent notes that PBII could not have generated commercially in Ecuador without the Licence Contract and thus the date of the Licence Contract is the critical date to be considered.199\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 308.\n\nRPHS, para. 3.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 111.\n\n213.\n\nRespondent notes that both Parties agree that the relevant date for determining when legitimate expectations are fixed is the date on which an investment is made. The problem lies, therefore, in identifying the investment in this case. Respondent submits that the relevant investment is PBII in combination with the Licence Contract, because it was only upon conclusion of the Licence Contract that Claimant was allowed to operate PBII.200\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 108.\n\n214.\n\nRespondent rejects the concept of the unity of the investment. In its view, the cases upon which Claimant relies all concern the separate question of whether there was an investment for the purposes of establishing ICSID jurisdiction.201 Respondent notes that PBI and PBII had different locations, different Licence Certificates and Contracts and contends that the success of the one was not dependent on the success of the other. According to Respondent, they constituted distinct investments.202\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 1002: 11-14.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 109.\n\n215.\n\nIn addition, Respondent submits that the PBII Charter Party was in force both on 31 March 2003 and on 16 April 2005 (the dates invoked by Claimant). In its view, only Proteus Power, the charterer of PBII, could therefore have had expectations at that time.203 According to Respondent, Ulysseas was *\"the bare owner of PBII\"* and it was only with the execution of the Licence Contract that *\"Ulysseas came to the fore, as it were, and committed itself with liabilities under the Licence Contract \"204*\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 112.\n\nTranscript, Day 5, pp. 1006:6-1007:8.\n\n(iii) *The violation of Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\na. Claimant\u2019s contentions\n-------------------------\n\n216.\n\nClaimant argues that its expectation of stability in the regulatory framework in the power sector was reasonable in light of promises contained or expectations engendered by (i) the PBI and PBII Contracts (in particular, Articles 7, 12.1.14, 23 and 24); (ii) the 1998 Constitution, which contained a number of relevant provisions regarding foreign investors (Articles 23, 244, 249(a) and 271); (iii) Articles 5 and 23 of the Power Sector Regime Law and (iv) the general course of conduct of Respondent, which included the establishment of the Payment Trusts, the tariff deficit payments and the Fuel for Power program.205\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 80.\n\n217.\n\nIn particular, Claimant refers to *\"the promises embodied'* in Article 5 of the Power Sector Regime Law:\n\n*\"Objectives - The following fundamental national policy objectives are established in the matter of generation, transmission and distribution of electricity:*\n\n*f) Regulate the transmission and distribution of electricity, ensuring that the applicable rates are fair to the investor as well as to the consumer;*\n\n*g) Establish rate systems which stimulate conservation and the rationale use of energy;*\n\n*h) Promote high-risk private investments in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, protecting the market\u2019s competitiveness... \"206*\n\nStatement of Reply, para 66.\n\n218.\n\nClaimant argues that Article 5 of the Law provides *\"an expectation [...] that the market will be there and that the State will be attempting to implement as it said it would this fundamental policy of protecting and promoting private investment in generation.\"207*\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 910: 11-15.\n\n219.\n\nClaimant thus argues that it held a legitimate expectation, created by Respondent, that generators such as Claimant would be entitled to charge a price for generation that would at least cover its costs, and further that it would actually receive such price. In Claimant\u2019s view, those legitimate expectations were however violated as a consequence of the following measures, all allegedly attributable to Respondent:\n\n(i) changes in the priority order, the legislation introduced in 2008;\n\n(ii) the elimination of the emergency measures in 2007;\n\n(iii) the more favorable treatment afforded to State-owned generation and transmission companies;\n\n(iv) the PPAs entered by State generation companies at a price well below the level that would sustain a private generation company;\n\n(v) Respondent\u2019s failure to exercise its power to penalize those end-users and transmissions companies who failed to pay for electricity they used in full;\n\n(vi) Respondent\u2019s negative to allow Claimant to terminate its contractual obligations;\n\n(vii) the empty and negligent negotiations;\n\n(viii) the seizure of PBII; and\n\n(ix) the imposition of fines on Claimant for failing to generate power.208\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 83.\n\n220.\n\nWith regard to Mandate No. 15, Claimant understands Respondent\u2019s position - according to which the enactment of Mandate No. 15 was irrelevant because Claimant\u2019s investment had already been rendered worthless by that time - as a tacit admission that Mandate No. 15 violated Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations. Claimant relies on Mr. Veldwijk\u2019s witness statement to insist on the impact of Mandate No. 15. In its view, Mandate No. 15 effectively eliminated the spot market and thus limited viable generation activities to only one option: PPAs. Claimant contends that not only did this force a fundamental change in Claimant\u2019s business model but this also handed substantial bargaining power to Claimant\u2019s counterparties in negotiations.209\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 73(c).\n\nb. Respondent\u2019s contentions\n---------------------------\n\n221.\n\nRespondent considers that Ecuador neither included assurances that Claimant\u2019s operations would be profitable nor guaranteed price or collection of payment. In Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant should have been aware that investing in Ecuador\u2019s electricity entailed risks. Respondent refers to various elements that reflect the risks that Claimant undertook:\n\n(i) Article 40 of the Power Sector Regime Law;\n\n(ii) the Licence Contract, which did not guarantee price or collection of payment and under which Claimant assumed all commercial risks;\n\n(iii) various Presidential Decrees, which had acknowledged the payment deficit existing in the electricity sector (deficits which are also said to be widely reported);\n\n(iv) the PBII Licence Certificate, which stated that Respondent did not ensure electric power production, price or market;\n\n(v) the fact that prices in the spot market were regulated by CENACE, whose role did not include paying generators through Payment Trusts; and\n\n(vi) the absence of guarantee that a generator would be able to charge a particular price for electricity sold to distribution company under a PPA.210\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 312.\n\n222.\n\nRespondent refutes as the existence of any *\"purported representations\"* made by way of the legal provisions invoked by Claimant. Respondent argues that Article 7 of the Licence Contract is a general provision that merely provided that the Licence holder would be entitled to all rights granted under Ecuadorian law, but did not guarantee profitability. As to Article 24 of the Licence Contract, Respondent argues that it is inapplicable because Claimant\u2019s rights were not altered or otherwise prejudiced. Article 249 of the 1998 Constitution is also inapplicable for the same reason. In addition, Respondent indicates that CONELEC did not treat Claimant any less favorably than other generators and thus Article 12.1.4 of the Licence Contract and Article 23 of the Power Sector Regime Law are also irrelevant.211\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 313.\n\n223.\n\nRespondent also describes Article 5 of the 1996 Power Sector Regime Law as a general provision that merely set forth policy objectives. Respondent argues that the Article is to be read in the light of *\"all circumstances [...] also the political, socioeconomic, cultural* *and historical conditions,\"* which included Article 40 of the 1996 Power Sector Regime Law. In any case, Respondent contends that the objectives set forth in Article 5 were not violated but, on the contrary, the payment deficit in the market was reduced and the measures proved to be a success.212\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 106.\n\n224.\n\nIn short, Respondent concludes that Claimant had no legitimate expectation that it would be guaranteed market, profitability, price or collection of payments. In Respondent\u2019s view, the reasoning in *Duke v. Ecuador* should thus apply here as well.213\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 314; *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A.* v. *Republic of Ecuador, supra* note 130.\n\n225.\n\nRespondent next addresses the regulatory changes which allegedly breached Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations. First, Respondent denies having downgraded Claimant in the payment priority order and affording State-owned generation companies more favorable treatment.214 In particular, Respondent argues that the 2007 payment priority order improved the prospects of collection of private generators selling power on the spot market.215 Second, Respondent contends that Claimant was never assured that it would rank in a particular order or that the priority orders would not change over time. Respondent argues that Claimant should have been aware of the collection problems faced by generation companies in the electricity sector. Respondent notes in this respect that *\"Mr. Korn confirmed that Ulysseas did not base its decision to sign the fifteen-year Licence Contract on a particular priority order\"216* Third, Respondent asserts that, since 2004, generation companies had been ranking below the transmission companies. Fourth, Claimant\u2019s allegation that the changes to the payment priority order preferred State-owned generation companies is, according to Respondent, not true and contradicted by the evidence (including Claimant\u2019s expert, Ing. Mu\u00f1oz). Fifth, Respondent points to adjustments that had been routinely made to the payment priority order since 2003 and argues that Claimant should not have been surprised by further changes. Finally, Respondent argues that Claimant alone is to blame for its failure to secure a PPA.217\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 321.\n\nRPHS, para. 8.\n\nRPHS, para. 7; Transcript, Day 2, pp. 265:10-266:10.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 321.\n\n226.\n\nRespondent also responds to Claimant\u2019s argument that the cancellation of the *Fuel for Power* program amounted to a breach of Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations. First, Claimant did not have any legitimate expectation that the program would continue indefinitely.218 Respondent notes that fuel credits were only available to generators through a series of decrees, *\"each of a limited duration and with no guarantee of renewal\"219* Second, Respondent contends that fuel credits were not withdrawn in 2007, since private generators (such as foreign-owned Intervisatrade or Electroquil) were able to continue to benefit from an equivalent credit structure by entering into credit agreements with PETROCOMERCIAL. In Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant would have enjoyed these fuel credits had it declared itself available to generate, which it never did.220 Third, the fuel credits were short term benefits, limited in time. According to Respondent, this fuel credit system based on emergency decrees was improved through the 2007 scheme.221 Finally, the introduction of measures to reduce historical debts was a general measure and not a specific assurance to Claimant that it would be able to recover payments due to it.222\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 322-326.\n\nRPHS, para. 10; Article 2 of Presidential Decree No. 2427, dated December 31, 2004, Exhibit CLA52; Transcript, Day 3, pp.551:25-552:6.\n\nRPHS, para. 11; Statement of Defence, para. 141; Statement of Rejoinder, para. 28.\n\nRPHS, para. 12; Transcript, Day 3, pp. 550:12-21, 551:19-24 and 552:7-14.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 322-326.\n\n227.\n\nWith respect to Mandate No. 15, Respondent contends that it could not have caused the failure of Claimant\u2019s PBII project since Claimant had determined from as early as December 2007 that it was \"nonviable\" for PBII to operate. Respondent argues that Mandate No. 15 was intended to stabilize the electricity sector for the benefit of all generators and that the regime was explained to all participants in the market, including Claimant.223 In Respondent\u2019s view, Mandate No. 15 improved the market, requiring the Ministry of Finance to cover, on a monthly basis, any shortfalls in payments to generators operating in the electricity sector. Respondent disputes that Mandate No. 15 somehow prevented generators from continuing to sell on the spot market.224 In any event, Respondent argues that Claimant was never assured of its continued participation in the spot market and that Claimant could have concluded a PPA, as all private generators did. In Respondent\u2019s view, many distribution companies sought to enter into a PPA with Claimant.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 327-332.\n\nRPHS, paras. 13-16.\n\n228.\n\nFinally, Respondent maintains that neither CONELEC\u2019s initial refusal to terminate the Licence Contract nor the Temporary Administration of PBII amounted to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. With regard to the former, Respondent reiterates that CONELEC\u2019s actions are not attributable to it and that those actions were justified in the circumstances by Claimant breach of the Licence Contract through its unjustified refusal to operate PBII as required by the Licence Contract. Regardless, Respondent asserts that Claimant had no legitimate expectation that it would be entitled to withdraw PBII from Ecuador following the termination of the Licence Contract and that, in any event, CONELEC terminated the Licence Contract on 17 March 2011.225\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 338.\n\n(iv) *The effect of Article 24 of the Licence Contract*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nArticle 24 of PBII Contract states:\n\n***\"TWENTY-FOUR: INDEMNIFICATION PAID TO THE PERMIT HOLDER.***\n\n*Article two hundred seventy-one of the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador stipulates that the State, through the GRANTOR, may establish special guarantees and security assurances to the investor to ensure that the agreements will not be modified by laws or other provisions of any type which have an impact on their clauses. If laws or standards are enacted which prejudice the investor or change the contract clauses, the State will pay the investor the respective compensation for damages caused by those situations, in such a way as to at all times restore and maintain the economic and financial stability which would have been in effect if the acts or decisions had not occurred.*226\n\nPBII Contract, *supra* note 39.\n\n230.\n\nDuring the hearing on the merits, the Tribunal circulated a list of questions to be addressed by the Parties either in their closing arguments at the hearing or in their Post-Hearing submissions. The Parties were asked, *inter alia,* to express their views on the effect of Article 24 of PBII Contract and to indicate whether Claimant had accepted the possibility of a change in the laws and regulations subject only to a right to compensation.\n\na. Claimant\u2019s contentions\n-------------------------\n\n231.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, through Article 24, CONELEC was offering protection to its counterparty for acts taken by a distinct party, the Republic of Ecuador. CONELEC would be standing as *\"an indemnitor\"* and Article 24 would cover an *\"indemnity claim\"227*\n\nTranscript, Day 5, pp. 911:1-914:1.\n\n232.\n\nClaimant argues that such a clause has no effect in the instant case - with the exception of one remote possibility discussed below. First, Claimant argues that Article 24 allowed it to make an indemnity claim against its contractual counterparty, but it did not limit other legal avenues: *\"the fact that we have a right to make that claim against our contractual party does not mean that we must make it first or that it constitutes a waiver of the claim against the party who caused the injury\"228*\n\nTranscript, Day 5, pp. 913:19-914:1.\n\n233.\n\nSecond, Claimant relies on the Interim Award to illustrate there is a distinction between CONELEC and Respondent. Claimant contends that the concession agreement sets up the potential for claims against one party, CONELEC, for one set of claims. On the other hand, the BIT permits a range of claims against another party, the State.229 Thus, the remedy available under the Treaty is claimed to be broader than the stability promise contained in the concession agreement.230\n\nTranscript, Day 5, pp. 914:16-915:1.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 81:14-23.\n\n234.\n\nThird, Claimant invokes policy and treaty interpretation reasons as a final argument. It refers to the decision of the Annulment Committee in *Vivendi,* where it was stated that *\"it is not open to an ICSID tribunal having jurisdiction under a BIT in respect of a claim based upon a substantive provision of that BIT, to dismiss the claim on the ground that it could or should have been dealt with by a national court\"231*\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 917:15-20; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Annulment, dated 3 July 2002, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Exhibit RLA30.\n\n235.\n\nFinally, Claimant concedes that Article 24 could have had an effect on the case: \"[Respondent] *might have a failure to mitigate argument\"* Nonetheless, it notes that Respondent has not pleaded that and that it has not *\"lead any evidence on it, so theoretically, it may have impact, but there is no evidence that it applies\"232*\n\nTranscript, Day 5, pp. 917:23-918:14.\n\nb. Respondent\u2019s contentions\n---------------------------\n\n236.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimant, in agreeing to Article 24, accepted the possibility of a change in laws and regulations subject only to a right of compensation. Respondent maintains that the guarantee of compensation is not automatic - *\"it needs to be implemented under the applicable law, which is Ecuadorian law\"233*\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 1016:13-20.\n\n237.\n\nRespondent refers to the 1997 Protection Guarantee Act and its Regulations, which had a method for implementing the protection of Article 271 of the Ecuadorian Constitution at the time. Respondent notes that Claimant has ignored the procedure foreseen in that legal regime and goes further to argue that *\"Article 24 speaks about maintaining the legal stability in exchange for any monetary compensation that might be paid to establish or reestablish that stability, but the whole premise of Article 24 is to require the investor to fulfill its obligations under the contract and to continue generating,\"234*\n\nTranscript, Day 5, pp. 1013:22-1015:9.\n\n238.\n\nRespondent insists that its allegations with regard to the PBII Contract are not allegations of jurisdiction. In Respondent\u2019s view, the core question is whether the fundamental basis of the claim is a contract or a treaty claim. Respondent refers to *RSM Production v. Grenada,* in which an ICSID tribunal rejected the claim because the fundamental basis of the claim was a contract claim that had already been attempted previously.235\n\nTranscript, Day 5, pp. 1011:5-1012:17.\n\n**2. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis and conclusion**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nArticle II(3)(a) of the BIT states that *\"[i]nvestment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law\"* According to Claimant, Respondent has failed to accord its investment such treatment.\n\n(i) *The level of protection under the BIT*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe reference made by Claimant to the holding of other awards in investments treaty arbitration236 makes it clear that in its view the essential element of the fair and equitable treaty standard are the legitimate expectations of the investor in *\"the stability of the legal and business framework\"*\n\nIn the Statement of Claim (paras. 73-79), Claimant cites to the awards in *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA v. United Mexican States, supra* note 181, para. 154; *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador, supra* note 186, para.183; *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic, supra* note 182, paras. 101-102; *Siemens v. Argentina, supra* note 79, para. 299.\n\n241.\n\nAccording to Claimant, as held by another tribunal, *\"the obligation not to upset an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations\"* means that *\"government must avoid arbitrarily changing the rules of the game in a manner that undermines the legitimate expectations of or the representations made to, an investor*,\"237 Other awards have held that, in addition to be *\"legitimate\"*, the investor\u2019s expectations must be *\"reasonable\"*,238 Others, that this standard is breached by the manner in which the State administration conducts individual relations with an investor short of handling negotiations *\"competently and professionally\".239*\n\n*Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine, supra* note 182, paras 419-420.\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic, supra* note 182, para. 302.\n\n*PSEG Global Inc. et al. v. Republic of Turkey,* Award, dated 19 January 2005, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5, para. 246.\n\n242.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s main contention that when it started to invest in Ecuador it legitimately expected that the regulatory framework in place at the time *\"would remain stable and unchanged to the extent that it would be allowed to continue to receive a reasonable return on its investment.\"240* The core of Claimant\u2019s claim is that *\"the fundamental change of policy which occurred in 2007 altered the overall framework of the Claimant\u2019s investment\"* and this *\"change in the legal framework for electricity was so radical that it amounted to a breach of legitimate expectations under the BIT.\"241*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 76\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 956: 12-14.\n\n243.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the fair and equitable treatment standard as interpreted by Claimant has no basis under international law, the standard under the BIT being more demanding. It does not require States to ensure that laws and regulations in place at a particular time will never be modified or that investment in their territory will be profitable.242\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 287-288.\n\n244.\n\nBy reference to the *Waste Management243* case, Respondent points to the type of serious misconduct that would be required in order to breach the minimum standard of fair and equitable treatment. This standard would be infringed by a State\u2019s conduct that is *\"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposing the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.\"* Respondent refers also to the fact that the high threshold of the standard places upon the investor the burden to proceed *\"with awareness of the regulatory situation.\"244*\n\n*Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States, supra* note 114, para. 98.\n\n*Grand River Enterprises et al. v. United States of America, supra* note 189, para. 44.\n\n245.\n\nAs to the reference made by Article II (3)(a) of the BIT to the minimum standard of treatment required by international law, the Tribunal notes that the international minimum standard has evolved over time. What matters in our case is that the treatment of foreign investors do not fall below this minimum international standard, regardless of the protection afforded by the Ecuadorian legal order.245\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic,* Award, dated 31 October 2011, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, para. 337.\n\n246.\n\nThe term *\"fair and equitable\"* treatment is not defined by the BIT. Pursuant to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, a treaty is to be interpreted *\"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\"* As noted by the Annulment Committee in the CMS case, *\"the fair and equitable standard has been invoked in a great number of cases brought to ICSID arbitration and there is some variation in the practice of arbitral tribunals in this respect\"246*\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic,* Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, dated 25 September 2007, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, note 86.\n\n247.\n\nAs held by another tribunal with reference to the same BIT, *\"[a]lthough fair and equitable treatment is not defined in the Treaty, the Preamble clearly records the agreement of the* *parties that such treatment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of economic resources. The stability of the* *legal and business framework is thus an essential element of fair and equitable treatment.247*\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador, supra* note 186, para. 183.\n\n248.\n\nThis conception was also adopted by other investment treaty tribunals.248 There are, however, tribunals that have adopted much narrower conceptions of the fair and equitable standard in the context of the recognition that one of the major components of this standard is the parties legitimate and reasonable expectations,249 subject to the State\u2019s normal regulatory power. The BIT Preamble makes reference in effect also to the need to maintain *\"maximum effective utilization of economic resources\"*\n\n*CMS v Argentina, supra* note 136, para. 274; *LG&E v. Argentina, supra* note 116, paras. 124-125.\n\n*Alex Genin and others v. The Republic of Estonia,* Award, dated 25 June 2001, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, para. 367; *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania, supra* note 183, paras. 216-217; *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania, supra* note 190, para. 332.\n\n249.\n\nIt is not the Tribunal\u2019s intent to formulate another description of this standard. It adheres to the holding of one of the awards referred to above, which appears particularly suited to the present case:\n\n*\"The idea that legitimate expectations, and therefore FET* [fair and equitable treatment], *imply the stability of the legal and business framework, may not be correct if stated in an overly-broad and unqualifiedformulation. The FET might then mean the virtual freezing of the legal regulation of economic activities, in contrast with the State\u2019s normal regulatory power and the evolutionary character of economic life. Except where specific promises or representations are made by the State to the investor, the latter may not rely on a bilateral investment treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes in the host State\u2019s legal and economic framework. Such expectation would be neither legitimate nor reasonable.\"250*\n\nA violation of the standard cannot be determined in the abstract, what is fair and reasonable depending on a confrontation of the objective expectations of the investor and the regulatory power of the State in the light of the circumstances of the case.251\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania, supra* note 183, para. 217. See also *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic, supra* note 182, para. 304; *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v.

Argentina,* Award, 5 September 2008, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, para. 255.\n\n(ii) *The date of the investment into Ecuador*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nIn order to establish whether the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations have been breached by the State\u2019s conduct, it is essential to determine the point in time to which reference should be made to that purpose. According to Claimant, its legitimate expectations originated in 2003 or, at the latest, on 16 April 2005 when PBII was imported into Ecuador.252 Respondent is rather of the view that Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations were fixed as of 12 September 2006, when Claimant entered into the Licence Contract for PBII.253\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 907:7-13.\n\nRPHS, para. 3.\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal shares Respondent\u2019s view. As held by many ICSID tribunals, the ordinary conception of an investment includes several basic characteristics, essentially: (a) it must consist of a contribution having an economic value; (b) it must be made for a certain duration; (c) there must be the expectation of a return on the investment, subject to an element of risk; (d) it should contribute to the development of the economy of the host State.254 While the last condition has been criticised, the others have been generally accepted by other tribunals and commentators in the field of investment treaty arbitration. Regardless of the definition of an \"investment\" under Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT, these factors inform the determination of the moment when Claimant \"invested\" in Ecuador in the ordinary sense and began relying on any legitimate expectations that it may have formed.\n\nAccording to the so-called *\"Satini test\",* *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Morocco,* Decision on Jurisdiction, dated 23 July 2001, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, para. 57.\n\n252.\n\nIn order for an \"investment\" to arise in this sense, there must be an actual transfer of money or other economic value from a national (whether a physical or a judicial person) of a foreign State to the host State through the assumption of some kind of commtiment ensuring the effectiveness of the contribution and its duration over a period of time. The entering into Ecuador of PBII and its attempt to moor it in different locations do not satisfy these conditions to the extent Claimant was still free, both subjectively and objectively, to leave Ecuador at any time in the absence of commitments compelling it to remain in the country. Only by entering into the Licence Contract for PBII on 12 September 2006 may Claimant\u2019s investment (which by its own definition includes the PBII Contract255) be deemed to have been made by an actual contribution of economic value to the host State for a given duration in the expectation of a return but subject to an element of risk.256 The date of 16 September 2006 must therefore be retained as the reference date for examining Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n*\"Both PBII and the PBII Contract constitute \u2018investments \u2019for the purposes of Article I (l)(a) of the BIT\u2019* (Statement of Claim, para. 38). It may be noted that the definition of \"investment\" under Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT includes *\"any license and permits pursuant to law\"* (under (v)).\n\nUnder the Licence Contract Claimant assumed *\"all commercial risks inherent to the activities in question\",* i.e. the electricity generation activities (Article 6.2).\n\n(iii) *The violation of Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nAs already mentioned,257 Claimant was well aware that the electricity regulatory framework had been for many years undergoing a process of constant evolution in order to meet the growing demand for electricity based on conditions that would be economically acceptable to all operators of the system: generators, transmission companies, distributors and end-consumers. The adjustments that had been routinely made since 2003 to the payment priority order are an example of this evolution. Claimant did not ignore the collection problem faced by generation companies in the electricity sector, the changes made to the payment priority order demonstrating Respondent\u2019s attention to this problem as well.\n\n*Supra,* para. 187.\n\n254.\n\nRegarding the *\"Fuel for Power\"* scheme, before the end of 2007, when the system was changed, fuel credits were available to all generators through a series of emergency decrees258 which were all subject to a limited duration with no guarantee of renewal.259 There could not therefore be legitimate expectations by Claimant that fuel credits would continue to be available in the absence of a specific commitment in that regard by the State. Fuel credits continued in any case to be available after 2007 through arrangements between PETROCOMERCIAL and the Ministry of Finance.260\n\nPresidential Decrees No. 2627, dated 31 December 2004; No. 436, dated 24 August 2005; No. 1331, dated 19 April 2006.\n\nAs acknowledged by one of Claimant\u2019s witnesses, Mr. Z. Korn, at the hearing (Transcript, Day 2, pp. 259:10-12, 261:6-8).\n\nAs explained by one of Respondent\u2019s witnesses, Mr. F. Vergara, at the hearing (Transcript, Day 3, pp. 553:25, 555:21).\n\n255.\n\nAs for Constituent Mandate No. 15, it improved the electricity market. Its Article 2 requires that the Ministry of Finance cover on a monthly basis the difference between generation, transmission and distribution costs and the flat rate fixed for end consumers, as determined by CONELEC.\n\n256.\n\nIn conclusion, Claimant could not expect, in September 2006, the immutability of the regulatory framework in the electricity sector,261 more specifically that *\"generators such as the Claimant would be entitled to charge a price for generators to at least cover its costs and further that it would actually receive such price.\"262* It has not been proven that regulatory changes in payments to power generators made Claimant business prospects worse than in September 2006, even assuming - which has not been demonstrated - that it could legitimately expect the stability of the electricity regulatory framework.\n\nClaimant has acknowledged at the hearing that its \"case is not that Respondent was not entitled to change its law or have a policy direction shift. Clearly, that is its prerogative\" (Transcript, Day 5, p. 474: 1-4).\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 82.\n\n(iv) *The effect of Article 24 of the Licence Contract*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the Parties\u2019 contentions regarding Article 24 of the Licence Contract following a question put to them at the hearing on the merits.263 Specifically, the Tribunal\u2019s question was whether Claimant, by entering into the Licence Contract, has accepted that a change in laws and regulations could be made by Respondent which might prejudice it as an investor, this being the core of Claimant\u2019s claim of breach of its legitimate expectations.\n\n*Supra,* para. 231 *et seq.* The text of Article 24 is reproduced in para. 229.\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that Article 24 of the Licence Contract has a bearing on the determination of Claimant\u2019s claim that it had a legitimate expectation that no prejudicial changes would be made to the electricity regulatory system. In effect, this provision shows that Claimant had accepted in September 2006 that changes might be introduced to laws *\"or other provisions of any nature\"* which *\"would prejudice the investor\"* and that, should this occur, compensation would be paid for damages so caused to it. Having elected to bring a claim based on the BIT, Claimant has waived its right to see compensation under Article 24 of the Licence Contract.\n\n259.\n\nIn the light of all the foregoing, Claimant\u2019s claim of breach by Respondent of the fair and equitable treatment under the BIT must be dismissed.\n\n**E.** The Alleged Breach of the Obligation to Provide Full Protection and Security by Respondent\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties\u2019 positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n(i) *Claimant\u2019s contentions*\n----------------------------\n\n260.\n\nClaimant affirms that Respondent has breached its obligations under Article 11(3)(a) of the BIT by failing to accord to Claimant\u2019s investment full protection and security. Claimant relies on *Occidental* to argue that \"full protection and security\" and \"fair and equitable treatment\" can be considered together.264 Therefore, to the extent that the Tribunal finds that there has been a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the promise of full protection and security would have also been violated.265 Claimant also asserts that investment treaty tribunals have moved away from the original restrictive approach to full protection and security and have stated that the standard *\"can apply to more than physical security of an investor or its property, because either could be subject to harassment without being physically harmed or seized\"266*\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador, supra* note 186.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 86-88.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 87; *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentina,* Final Award, dated 20 August 2007, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Exhibit CLA67.\n\n261.\n\nIn addition, Claimant argues that Respondent has violated the promise of full protection and security, even under a narrow definition of the protection, through the direct physical damage its agents and representatives caused to PBII during the Temporary Administration.267 Claimant references its previous allegations as to the attribution of CONELEC\u2019s and Termopichincha\u2019s actions to Respondent and further states that *\"this* *was a vessel directly in the control of the State and the way they operated it did not comply with the basic duty of due diligence. If the State is going to take our barge away, the State is going to take Ulysseas\u2019s barge and operate it, at the very least; the State should be required to operate it with a basic standard of care so that it is not doing damage to the barge while doing so.\"268*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 89. Statement of Reply, para. 88 b).\n\nTranscript, Day 5, pp.940:3-940:15.\n\n262.\n\nFinally, Claimant alleges that there is no need to show an exhaustion of local remedies and that the jurisprudence cited by Respondent in this regard is not on point.269\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 88 e).\n\n(ii) *Respondent\u2019s contentions*\n-------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, it is not responsible for any damage allegedly caused to PBII during the period of Temporary Administration and that the duty of full protection and security is one of due care to protect against external force and which does not apply to the use of contractual remedies.270\n\nRPHS, para. 17; *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic, supra* note 182; *El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic, supra* note 245, submitted by the Claimant during the Hearing on the Merits.\n\n264.\n\nRespondent asserts that it is not widely accepted that the obligation to provide full protection and security reaches beyond physical interferences or that the standard extends beyond a due diligence obligation applicable in civil strife and circumstances of physical violence.271\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 340; *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic, supra* note 182; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA v. United Mexican States, supra* note 181; *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, supra* note 107.\n\n265.\n\nRespondent also claims that, even if the standard of full protection and security could be equated with the standard of fair and equitable treatment, Respondent did not breach the standard of fair and equitable treatment. Respondent relies on *Occidental,* in which the tribunal stated that *\"a treatment that is not fair and equitable automatically entails an absence of full protection and security of the investment.\"272*\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 341. Transcript, Day 1, pp.67:24-68:4.\n\n266.\n\nRespondent contends that CONELEC\u2019s Temporary Administration of PBII does not amount to a breach of the obligation to provide full protection and security by Respondent under the BIT for three reasons. First, it insists that neither CONELEC nor Termopichincha\u2019s actions are attributable to Respondent, since there was no exercise of governmental authority involved.273 In its view, the Temporary Administration was carried out pursuant to, and in order to enforce, the provisions of the Licence Contract.274 As to Termopichincha, Respondent claims that Termopichincha was acting as CONELEC\u2019s agent only under Ecuadorian law; attribution in this case is, however, governed by the *lex specialis* of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.275\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 119.\n\nRPHS, para. 18.\n\nRPHS, para. 20.\n\n267.\n\nSecond, Respondent claims that no damage was caused to PBII. It argues that the certificate prepared by the notary contains nothing of substance on the operational condition of the barge, nor on the state of its engines.276 As to the reports by Waller Marine and MAN Diesel, Respondent claims that they simply comment on the state of the barge at the time it was inspected in late 2010 (not immediately prior to the Temporary Administration).277 Finally, Respondent asserts that Mr. Bordei\u2019s statement heavily relies on these two reports and is therefore not sufficient on its own to establish that Termopichincha caused any damage to the barge.278\n\nVideo (including accompanying Notarial Certification dated 27 September 2010), dated 27 September 2010, Exhibit C144.\n\nCondition Survey of PBII prepared by Waller Marine, dated 11 November 2010, Exhibit C145; Report prepared by MAN Diesel, dated 14 February 2011, Exhibit Cl46.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 120.\n\n268.\n\nThird, Respondent alleges that, even if some damage had been caused to PBII, this would still not amount to a breach by Respondent of the full protection and security standard. Respondent relies on *Saluka* to argue that the standard only requires due care and reasonable behavior.279 In its view, both CONELEC and Termopichincha exercised due care, since they conducted the Temporary Administration of PBII *\"professionally and diligently\"280*\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic, supra* note 182.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, paras. 44 and 121.\n\n269.\n\nFinally, Respondent notes that Claimant failed to pursue the domestic legal and other avenues available to it to prevent the alleged harm. While it recognizes that the failure to invoke domestic legal channels is not a procedural bar to bringing a BIT claim, it argues that the fact that legal channels were available at all times to Claimant allowing it to seek redress for any physical damage caused to PBII during, or injunction of, the Temporary Administration further supports the position that Respondent did not fail to protect Claimant\u2019s investment.281 In Respondent\u2019s view, its obligation is confined to ensuring that adequate legal channels are made available, for which it refers to *Lauder v. Czech Republic282*\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, paras. 122-123.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 123; *Ronald Lauder v. Czech Republic,* Final Award, dated 3 September 2011, UNCITRAL, para. 314, Exhibit RLA48.\n\n270.\n\nRespondent also asserts that Claimant refused CONELEC\u2019s offer to assume the Temporary Administration of PBII, did not provide handover assistance and never made use of its right to take over the Temporary Administration or to monitor Termopichincha\u2019s operation of PBII.283\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 124.\n\n**2. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis and conclusion**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s view that \"full protection and security\" and \"fair and equitable treatment\" can be considered together, *\"as both treatments require the State to provide stability and predictability\".284*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 86. Claimant relies for this proposition on the Award in *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador, supra* note 186, para. 191.\n\n272.\n\nThe Tribunal does not share this view. Full protection and security is a standard of treatment other than fair and equitable treatment, as made manifest by the separate reference made to the two standards by Article II (3)(a) of the BIT. This standard imposes an obligation of vigilance and care by the State under international law comprising a duty of due diligence for the prevention of wrongful injuries inflicted by third parties to persons or property of aliens in its territory or, if not successful, for the repression and punishment of such injuries.285\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v The Argentine Republic, supra* note 245, paras. 522-523 and cases referred to therein.\n\n273.\n\nThe Temporary Administration of PBII having been performed by a third party, but pursuant to the Licence Contract, any physical damage caused to PBII should be settled according to this Contract. There was therefore no breach of full protection and security under the BIT, as contended by Claimant.286\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 89; Statement of Reply, paras. 87-88.\n\n274.\n\nThe claim that the State has breached the full protection and security standard of treatment under the BIT must be dismissed.\n\n**F.** The Allegedly Discriminatory Measures Adopted by Respondent\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties\u2019 positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n(i) *Claimant\u2019s contentions*\n----------------------------\n\n275.\n\nClaimant alleges that Respondent\u2019s conduct has been discriminatory in contravention of Article II(3)(b). Claimant relies on *Antoine Goetz et consorts* for the idea that a measure is discriminatory in effect if it results in a treatment of an investor different from that accorded to other investors in a similar or comparable situation.287 Claimant asserts that an investor is entitled to have the same relevant legislative and regulatory framework, including any subsidies or benefits built into that framework applied to it as to others engaged in the same economic activity. According to Claimant, this standard of protection requires that Respondent not discriminate between Claimant and comparable entities -which in this case mostly concerns entities owned by the State.288\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 92; *Antoine Goetz and Ors v. Burundi,* Award, dated 10 February 1999, ICSID Case No.ARB/95/3, para. 121, Exhibit CLA21.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 93.\n\n276.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, the guarantee of protection has been violated for several reasons. First, it claims that private generators have consistently been pushed down the payment priority ranking at a faster rate than State-owned generators. Second, it argues that the State-owned transmission companies have been effectively rendered immune after the changes in priority order. Third, it affirms that Respondent has created an electricity sector whose cost structure is set up in such a manner as to benefit the State-owned generators which have no requirement to make any form of profit margin, so as to flood the market with low-cost PPAs, making it impossible for privately held generators to win economically viable PPAs.289 Finally, Claimant argues that other private generators were treated more favorably than itself. For example, Claimant refers to Termoguayas, whose project *\"received a much improved collection priority in respect of old debts which allowed Termoguayas to skip up the payment priority waterfall, in effect to go to the top of the payment waterfall in a manner that was simply not contemplated under Mandate 15. The State decided not to follow its own rules and gave Termoguayas a pass on the payment property waterfall\"290*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 94.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 69:24-70:12.\n\n277.\n\nClaimant contends that Article 11(3)(b) offers protection against discrimination in general terms. It relies on *CMS v. Argentina,* among other decisions, to argue that investment treaty tribunals have confirmed that such protection includes the prevention of discrimination against an investment within a sector rather than by nationality.291 It also insists that both generators and transmission companies are engaged in the same economic activity, since the presence of one in the payment waterfall impacts on the other in terms of their ability to collect from that waterfall. Claimant thus asks the Tribunal to look at economic impact when establishing comparators.292\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 92(a); *CMS Gas Transmission Co v. Argentine Republic, supra* note 136; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic, supra* note 136; *Sempra Energy International v. Argentina,* Award, dated 28 September 2007, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Exhibit CLA98.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 92(b).\n\n278.\n\nFinally, Claimant contends that any reliance on the public interest to excuse the treaty violations must fall within the scope of the doctrine of necessity, described at Article 25 of the ILC Articles.293\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 92(c); ILC Articles, *supra* note 65, Article 25.\n\n(ii) *Respondent\u2019s contentions*\n-------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nRespondent contends that the BIT does not define the term *\"discriminatory\"* and that the standard proffered by Claimant is unsupported by law.294 In Respondent\u2019s view, the Commentary to the 1967 OECD Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property makes clear that discrimination must be based on nationality, for which it also relies on *Feldman v. Mexico, Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania* and *Pope & Talbot.295* Respondent also argues that the cases relied on by Claimant do not support its proposition that the protection against discrimination is confined to discrimination on the grounds of nationality.296\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 345.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 346-349; *Marvin Feldman v. Mexico,* Award, dated 16 December 2002, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/l, Exhibit RLA4; *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania, supra* note 190; *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada,* Interim Award, dated 2 April 2001, UNCITRAL, Exhibit RLA3.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 129\n\n280.\n\nRespondent makes three points to support its contention that there is only one standard for discriminatory treatment, discrimination on the basis of nationality. First, Respondent refers to *Parkerings* to assert that *\"in order to determine whether there has been discrimination, the treatment of foreign investors must be compared to the treatment of domestic investors\"297* Second, Respondent argues that the cases against Argentina on which Claimant relies do not provide support for the position that the discrimination protection under a BIT extends beyond discrimination on the basis of nationality. Respondent remarks that in all three cases the tribunal in question held that there had been no discriminatory treatment.298 Finally, Respondent claims that such a broad interpretation of the discrimination clause would be contrary to the object and purpose of the BIT, which is, *\"after all, about the protection of foreign investment\"299* Nonetheless, Respondent maintains that no breach is established even under a broad approach to the protection against discriminatory treatment.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 118:1-119:10; *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Lithuania, supra* note 190.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 119:11-120:14; *CMS Gas Transmission Co v Argentine Republic, supra* note 136; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic, supra* note 136; *Sempra Energy International v. Argentina, supra* note 291.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 120:5-120:15.\n\n281.\n\nAs to the first Claimant\u2019s point, the alleged discrimination of private generators, Respondent claims that Claimant must show that it was (i) treated differently from other thermal generators; (ii) that such differential treatment was due to a measure taken by Respondent; and that (iii) there was no legitimate object or purpose that justified the less favorable treatment. Respondent claims that Claimant has failed on each of these requirements.300\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 350.\n\n282.\n\nRespondent asserts that it is not true that changes in priority order resulted in reducing private generators down the priority ranking. On the contrary, Respondent argues that *\"private generators were in fact treated better,\"301* and were continuously ranked above State-owned generators.302\n\nTranscript, Day l,p. 120:16-120:17.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 352; Witness Statement of Jorge Vergara, Exhibit RWS-8.\n\n283.\n\nWith regard the alleged preferential treatment of State-owned transmission companies, Respondent considers that transmission companies are not in the same business or economic sector as thermal generators and are therefore irrelevant for the purposes of determining whether there was discriminatory treatment.303 Respondent argues that generation and transmission companies perform entirely different functions, despite operating in the same sector, and notes that without the transmission companies, the generators would not be able to access the market altogether.304 In addition, Respondent submits that transmission companies have ranked before generation companies since 2004, long before PBII was imported into Ecuador.305\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 353.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 121:7-122:20.\n\nStatement of Defence, para 353.\n\n284.\n\nRespondent also rejects the Claimant\u2019s allegation that Respondent created a market situation where it was impossible for private generators to win economically viable PPAs. Respondent argues that this allegation is *\"absurd\u2019* and Claimant has provided no evidence that it would have been able to secure a PPA if the regulatory changes had not been introduced. In Respondent\u2019s view, this was a result of business planning and commercial considerations and not of the changes of the regulatory framework, and that the allegation is belied by the examples of the PPAs concluded by Electroquil and Termoguayas.306\n\n*Id.,* para. 354.\n\n285.\n\nRespondent also argues that Claimant offers no evidence whatsoever that State-owned generators *\"have no requirement to make any form of profit margin,\"* and that, even if such evidence were provided, this would not amount to a breach of the BIT. In addition, Respondent notes that all thermal generators (local and foreign) were equally affected by the payment difficulties and none of the measures distinguished between local and foreign generators. Moreover, Respondent claims that these measures were in the public interest and necessary to respond to the state of emergency.307\n\n*Id.,* para. 354.\n\n286.\n\nAs to the allegedly more favorable treatment afforded to other private generators, and to Termoguayas in particular, Respondent contends that circumstances were different as between Termoguayas and Claimant. Respondent notes that it was not the State that granted Termoguayas a higher priority, but CATEG, through the PPA they entered in 2008. Respondent also notes that Termoguayas was not given a higher ranking in the payment priority order for its spot sales.308\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 122:21-124:1.\n\n287.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that it does not need to rely on the doctrine of necessity under Article 25 of the ILC Articles. Instead, Respondent claims that there has been no breach of the BIT and therefore no wrongful conduct. In Respondent\u2019s view, for a finding of a discriminatory treatment, there must be at least evidence of *\"capricious, irrational or absurd differentiation in the treatment accorded to the Claimant as compared to other entities\",* which, in its opinion, cannot be found in this case.309\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 130; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic, supra* note 136.\n\n**2. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis and conclusion**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nArticle II(3)(b) of the BIT provides:\n\n*\"Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion or disposal of investments.\"*\n\n289.\n\nRelying on *Goetz v. Burundi,* Claimant asserts that *\"a measure is discriminatory in effect if it results in a treatment of an investor different from that accorded to other investors in a similar or comparable situation\"310* This protection is provided also by the Ecuadorian Constitution of 1998, which guarantees equal treatment to public and private business activities and equal conditions to local and foreign investment.311\n\nStatement of Claim, para.92; *Goetz and Ors v. Burundi, supra* note 287.\n\n1998 Constitution, *supra* note 9, Article 244(1), referred to in the Statement of Claim, para. 93.\n\n290.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s position that this guarantee has been violated by: a) changes in priority order, so that private generators have always been ranked below State-owned generators; b) State-owned transmission companies being consistently prioritised by rendering them immune at the expense of private generators; c) the cost structure of the electricity sector being such as to benefit the State-owned generators since the latter have no requirement to make profit, thus flooding the market with low-cost PPAs making it impossible for private generators to win viable PPAs.312\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 94.\n\n291.\n\nClaimant\u2019s alleged discrimination relates to national State-owned entities operating in more favourable conditions than private generators, whether national or foreign, in similar situations.\n\n292.\n\nAs already mentioned, Respondent contends that there is only one standard for discriminatory treatment, which is discrimination on the basis of nationality. It relies on the OECD Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property and on a certain number of cases.\n\n293.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, for a measure to be discriminatory it is sufficient that, objectively, two similar situations are treated differently. As stated by the ICSID tribunal in *Goetz v. Burundi, \"discrimination supposes a differential treatment applied to people who are in similar situations\"313* As such, discrimination may well disregard nationality and relate to a foreign investor being treated differently from another investor whether national or foreign in a similar situation.\n\n*Goetz and Ors v. Burundi, supra* note 287, para. 121.\n\n294.\n\nRegarding the first situation of discrimination alleged by Claimant, in September 2006, when the Licence Contract was signed, State-owned generators continued to rank below similarly situated private generators in the payment priority order.314 The same applied in 2007315 and 2009316 for private generators with PPA\u2019s, while in these two years private generators purchasing on the spot market were ranked below State-owned generation companies with PPAs. To the extent that having a PPA is a situation which may be considered not similar to purchasing on the spot market, it may be held that there was no discrimination to the prejudice of private generation companies when compared to the State-owned generation companies. There was clearly a State policy to prompt generation companies, whether private or State-owned, to enter into PPAs. It appears that Claimant, in any case, did not attach much significance to payment priorities.317\n\nMu\u00f1oz Report, *supra* note 30, pp. 41-42.\n\n*Id.,* pp. 43-44.\n\n*Id.,* pp. 45-46.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. Z. Korn, one of Claimant\u2019s witnesses, stated: \"we *were not so much inclined to worry about payment priorities..*.\" (Transcript: Day 2, pp. 265:19, 266:10).\n\n295.\n\nRegarding the second situation of alleged discrimination, transmission companies are in a situation different from that of generation companies, so that no discrimination between the two categories may be deemed to exist, as pointed out by Respondent.318\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 353. Respondent has also pointed out that transmission companies have always ranked above generation companies since 2004, therefore long before Claimant entered into the Licence Contract for PBII.\n\n296.\n\nAs to the third situation of alleged discrimination, Respondent notes that the changes in the cost structure of the electricity sector in 2008 are not relevant since Claimant had already determined in September 2007 that the PBII was non-viable economically and commercially.319 This argument cannot be accepted since Claimant\u2019s position at the end of 2007 might have changed in the presence of more favourable conditions of the electricity sector in 2008. Such was the case with the enactment of Constituent Mandate No. 15 in July 2008, a measure introduced to address the payment deficit in the electricity sector.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 354 (first bullet point).\n\n297.\n\nUnder Article 2 of the Constituent Mandate No. 15 the Ministry of Finance was required to cover, on a monthly basis, any shortfalls in payments to generators operating in the electricity sector. The new system proved successful, the rate of collection of generators having gradually improved to reach 94% in 2010.320 The system would have equally applied to Claimant had it elected to sell on the spot market or under a PPA. Regarding the latter option, the Tribunal has already concluded that Claimant was unable to secure a PPA not because of changes in the regulatory framework, but rather due to its own commercial considerations.321\n\nLetter from CONELEC to the National Directorate of International Affairs and Arbitration, dated 28 November 2011, Exhibit R316.\n\n*Supra,* para. 198.\n\n298.\n\nFor all the above reasons, Claimant\u2019s claim of discriminatory measures taken by Respondent against it must be dismissed.\n\n**G.** The Alleged Arbitrary Treatment by Respondent\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties\u2019 positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n(i) *Claimant\u2019s contentions*\n----------------------------\n\n299.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent has violated its obligation under Article II(3)(b) of the BIT to provide protection against arbitrary treatment. Claimant relies on *Occidental* to argue that *\"where a State has presented a conflicting and uncertain regulatory framework and/or series of representations, it is acting in an arbitrary fashion\"322*\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 96-97; *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador, supra* note 186.\n\n300.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, Respondent acted arbitrarily towards Claimant in the following situations: (i) the alleged promise made by Minister Mosquera that CATEG would enter into a PPA with Claimant and the subsequent denial by CATEG that Minister Mosquera had the authority to act on its behalf; (ii) the alleged creation by Respondent of a pricing structure highly favorable to State entities, while suggesting at the same time that Claimant would enter into a profitable PPA; (iii) the negotiations with Termoesmeraldas for seven months, after which Termoesmeraldas allegedly confirmed it did not have the funds to purchase the barge; and (iv) the contention by Minister Mosquera that PBII would *\"die in Ecuador,\"* which was made without offering *\"any sensible solution to help the* *barge make money\"* or allowing PBII to leave Ecuador and produce electricity elsewhere.323\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 98.\n\n301.\n\nClaimant argues that such conduct was arbitrary in the sense that Claimant was being presented with inconsistent and conflicting representations from varying facets of Respondent.324 Claimant refers again to *Occidental,* in which the tribunal held that *\"it was that very confusion and lack of the clarity that resulted in some form of arbitrariness, even if not intended by the* [State body]\".325\n\n*Id.,* para. 99.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 70:16-70:20.\n\n302.\n\nIn particular, when comparing its situation to the one in *Occidental,* it argues that after Constituent Mandate No. 15 was enacted, Claimant was subjected to a circular process of being handed from government minister to State-owned company, to regulatory body, to central government, on the key question of who could authorize a modality of selling power which let Claimant cover costs and collect payments.\n\n303.\n\nIn relation to the discussions with the Minister, Claimant refers to the witness evidence by Mr. Veldwijk.326 Claimant describes the meetings with Minister Mosquera on 5 and 12 December 2007 and with CONELEC\u2019s Executive Director, Fernando Izquierdo, on 19 December 2007, during which both representatives led Claimant to believe that it would sign a PPA in the short term.327\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 90.\n\nCPHS, paras. 12-14. Claimant contends that, after reviewing Ulysseas\u2019 financial information, Minister Mosquera assured, *inter alia,* that: (i) PBII could be a *good business',* (ii) there would be a sole buyer of electricity that would sign PPAs with generators; and (iii) Claimant would be asked to sign a PPA. Claimant also relies on the minutes of a meeting with Mr. Izquierdo, according to which Mr. Izquierdo told Claimant that it \"would be able to sign a PPA according to a term and above all according to a price that could make PBII viable.\"\n\n304.\n\nClaimant goes on to relate its meeting with Minister Mosquera on 31 January 2008, where it alleges that Minister Mosquera told Claimant that it could sign a PPA with CATEG on the same terms as a PPA Termoguayas had just signed days earlier.328 Claimant further cites the witness evidence of Mario Restrepo and Mr. Restrepo\u2019s contemporaneous written summary of the meeting.329 Claimant also notes that Respondent has failed to present Minister Mosquera to rebut the statements contained in Mr. Restrepo\u2019s contemporaneous written summary.330\n\nCPHS, para. 14.\n\n*Id.,* at para. 14 a).\n\n*Id.,* at para. 14 b).\n\n305.\n\nWith respect to the negotiations with Termoesmeraldas, Claimant contends that it always acted in a reasonable manner. Claimant refutes Respondent\u2019s argument that the negotiations failed because Claimant unreasonably demanded a *\"firm, binding purchase agreement, subject to acceptable test program*,\"331 In Claimant\u2019s view, its demands were reasonable and prudent in light of the high costs and risks to start-up and test the barge, and in any event, on 20 January 2009, Claimant learned Termoesmeraldas had *\"neither the money nor the authority\"* to purchase PBII.332\n\nE-mail from Mr. Jan Veldwijk to Mr. Jon Pollock and Mr. German Efromovich (including attachment) dated 30 September 2008, Exhibit Cl 17.\n\nCPHS, para. 19. Claimant refers to the e-mail from Mr. Jan Veldwijk to Mr. Jon Pollock and Mr. German Efromovich dated 21 January 2009, Exhibit Cl 23. See also Statement of Reply, para. 90.\n\n306.\n\nFinally, Claimant notes that Respondent does not seek to justify how seizing control of PBII and fining Claimant for not generating power in a period where it no longer had control of the vessel can be *\"anything other than arbitrary treatment\"333*\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 91.\n\n(ii) *Respondent\u2019s contentions*\n-------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nRespondent contends that there is nothing confusing or lacking in clarity neither in the regulatory framework that operates in Ecuador\u2019s electricity sector nor in the way Respondent treated Claimant and its investment.334\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 355.\n\n308.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant\u2019s reliance on *Occidental* is misplaced. In that case, the Tribunal noted that the framework under which the investor had been operating had been changed in an important manner and indicated that the clarifications sought by the Claimant only found unclear and vague answers. Respondent argues that the situations are not comparable because there was no significant change in the regulatory framework governing the electricity sector in Ecuador.335\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 356.\n\n309.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the allegation that Mandate No. 15 was, of itself, arbitrary, is entirely unsupported. First, Respondent argues that Mandate No. 15 did not cause the failure of the PBII project, which had already been described by Claimant as *\"nonviable\"* as early as December 20 07.336 Second, Respondent argues that a finding of arbitrary treatment requires some measure of *\"impropriety\"*, which is absent in the present case where Mandate No. 15 was a measure introduced in good faith to improve the functioning of the electricity sector.337 Third, Respondent notes that Mandate No. 15 is applied equally to all participants in the sector. Finally, Respondent contends that after Mandate No. 15 was enacted, steps were taken to ensure that it was explained to all private generators (through two CONELEC regulations, meetings with generation and distribution companies and negotiation committees).338\n\nLetter from Ulysseas to CONELEC, dated 21 December 2007, Conclusion 3, Exhibit C92.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 136; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic, supra* note 136.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, paras. 134-138.\n\n310.\n\nRespondent also refutes one by one the actions described by Claimant as amounting to arbitrary treatment. First, Respondent claims that the actions of CATEG are not attributable to it. However, even assuming attribution, Respondent maintains that CATEG did not act arbitrarily in its negotiations with Claimant since (i) Claimant was too late in submitting its formal proposal to CATEG in February 2008, by which time CATEG had already secured its energy demand for that year; (ii) Claimant made undisclosed proposals to two distribution companies, who rejected them because they *\"deemed the asking price too high\"-,* and (iii) Mr. Veldwijk confirmed that Ulysseas was not interested in executing a PPA once it submitted its Notice of Arbitration in December 2008.339\n\nRPHS, paras. 25-28.\n\n311.\n\nSecond, Respondent insists that Minister Mosquera never guaranteed that Claimant would execute a PPA with CATEG. In particular, Respondent notes the Minister *\"contemporaneously informed the Claimant in writing that he made no such promise \"340* In Respondent\u2019s view, *\"Minister Mosquera only illustrated to Ulysseas possible terms on which it may be able to negotiate and eventually execute a PPA with CATEG\"341* For this purpose, Respondent remarks that Dr. Restrepo confirmed Ecuador\u2019s understanding of the meeting notes and admitted at the Hearing that Minister Mosquera\u2019s letter was consistent with the meeting notes of 31 January 2008.342\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 143.\n\nRPHS, para. 23.\n\n*Id.* Respondent refers to Transcript, Day 2, pp. 311:25-312:5 and Transcript, Day 2. pp. 320:8-321:1.\n\n312.\n\nThird, Respondent claims not to have behaved arbitrarily in connection with the \"cost structure\" that applied to the electricity sector and argues that the reason why Claimant was unable to secure a PPA was because of its insistence on an inordinately high price. Respondent also claims not to have behaved arbitrarily in connection with the negotiations with Termoesmeraldas - which, in its view, reached a stalemate because Claimant refused to bear the testing costs and insisted on unreasonable terms - and notes that there were no formal or legal impediments that prevented Claimant from selling PBII.343 Respondent argues that negotiations were entered into by Termoesmeraldas on a purely commercial basis, without any *puissance publique* element involved, and so cannot engage its responsibility. In addition, Respondent argues that it was perfectly reasonable for Termoesmeraldas to refuse Claimant\u2019s conditions. In Respondent\u2019s view, it would have been premature for the parties to execute a binding agreement before the negotiations were finalized.344 Respondent refers to Mr. Wells, who in his testimony confirmed that Termoesmeralda\u2019s requirement that PBII must be tested at full load before sale completion was *\"reasonable\"*,345 Respondent also contends that it was Termoesmeraldas who gave Claimant a draft letter of intent for the commercial testing of PBII prior to purchase, to which Claimant never responded.346\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 357.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, paras. 144-146.\n\n*Id.* Respondent refers to Transcript, Day 1, pp. 358:22-359:6, Witness Statement of Mr. Robert Wells, Exhibit CWS-8.\n\nRPHS, para. 29.\n\n313.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent contends not to have behaved arbitrarily in connection with Minister Mosquera\u2019s alleged remark that *\"PBII would die in Ecuador\"* Respondent asserts that, *\"even if* [it] *were true\",* it would not amount to a breach of the BIT, because Claimant had no automatic entitlement to withdraw PBII from Ecuador. Respondent emphasizes that Mr. Wells confirmed his understanding that CONELEC had the stipulated option to acquire PBII upon the termination of the Licence Contract and noted that the Licence Contract terminated on 17 March 2011 and Ulysseas has since removed PBII from Ecuador.347 In relation to the complaint by Claimant that the Minister did not offer *\"any sensible solution to help the barge make money\",* Respondent says it had no obligation to do so.348\n\nRPHS, para. 24.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 357.\n\n314.\n\nWith respect to the imposition of fines by CONELEC during the Temporary Administration, Respondent claims that these are not attributable to it because they were actions of a contractual party, pursuant to Article 14.5 of the PBII Licence Contract, and they were not imposed in exercise of any governmental authority or *puissance publique.* It relies on *Bayindir,* where the Tribunal stated that *\"there was no basis for the Claimant to expect that* [CONELEC] *would not avail itself of its contractual rights\"349*\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, paras. 139-141; *Bayindir Insaat Turizim Ticaret Ve Sanayi A. S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* Award, dated 27 August 2009, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Exhibit RLA49.\n\n315.\n\nIn addition, Respondent explains that CONELEC executed penalties under the Licence Contract against Claimant for two reasons. In the first instance, Claimant was fined for its failure to commence commercial operations on 3 October 2009.350 Second, Claimant was imposed a penalty for its failure to perform the Licence Contract. This non-performance penalty, which accrued just once and not on a time basis, was triggered well before the Temporary Administration. Respondent thus argues that CONELEC never penalized Claimant for failing to operate during the period of Temporary Administration.351 Respondent finally notes that Claimant could have ended the Temporary Administration and, therefore, could have avoided the imposition of the fines at any point had it indicated that it would comply with its obligations under the Licence Contract.352\n\nRPHS, para. 30\n\n*Id.,* paras. 30-33.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 142.\n\n**2. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis and conclusion**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent acted arbitrarily in the following situations:\n\na. when Minister Mosquera conveyed to Claimant that CATEG would enter into a PPA on terms acceptable to Claimant;\n\nb. by creating a price structure favourable to State entities, thus undercutting Claimant\u2019s ability to enter into a profitable PPA;\n\nc. when Termoesmeraldas, a State owned company, negotiated for 7 months the purchase of PBII to then confirm that it did not have the necessary funds; and\n\nd. when Minister Mosquera informed Claimant that PBII would *\"die in EcuadoC* without offering any sensible solution or allowing PBII to leave the Country.\n\n317.\n\nClaimant was thus presented with inconsistent and conflicting representations in violation of Article 11(3)(b) of the BIT.353 As already mentioned, the imposition of fines for lack of power generation is also cited by Claimant as constituting arbitrary treatment.354\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 98-99; Statement of Reply, para. 89.\n\nStatement of Reply, para.91.\n\n318.\n\nThe Tribunal has already expressed the view that Minister Mosquera\u2019s conduct, by creating an expectation that Claimant might conclude a favourable PPA, is not exempt from criticism but has concluded that such conduct, considering all relevant circumstances, does not amount to a breach of the BIT.355 Apart from the expression used Minister Mosquera,356 it was Claimant\u2019s obligation, freely undertaken by the signature of the Licence Contract, to generate electricity for the country. In the absence of conditions that might have justified the termination of the Licence Contract or the occurrence of a *force majeure* situation, Claimant was bound to perform power generation activities for 15 years. It was not for Minister Mosquera to offer Claimant alternative solutions or allow PBII to leave Ecuador in the absence of grounds for terminating of the Licence Contract.\n\n*Supra,* paras. 194-195.\n\n\"PBII would die in Ecuador\".\n\n319.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent acted arbitrarily by presenting a conflicting and uncertain regulatory framework. Respondent replies that there was no significant changes in the regulatory framework that governed the electricity sector, including its cost structure357. As held by another tribunal, \" *...a finding* of *arbitrariness requires that some important measure of impropriety is manifest\"358* This is not given in the present case. Specifically, Constituent Mandate No. 15 was enacted in the frame of a series of measures taken over many years to solve the payment problem and to improve the functioning of the electricity sector by favouring long-term supply agreements, the PPAs.359\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 355 and 357 (second bullet point).\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v Argentine Republic, supra* note 136, para. 281.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 136. See also *supra,* para. 255.\n\n320.\n\nThere was nothing *\"improper\"* in the enactment of Constituent Mandate No. 15 on 23 July 2008 and in its implementation through CONELEC\u2019s subsequent regulations. There is no evidence that the cost structure applied differently to generation companies, whether public or private. Further, as already mentioned, all private generation companies were able to secure viable PPAs; Claimant was not excluded from the relevant negotiation process but failed to secure a PPA for commercial considerations.360\n\n*Supra,* para. 198.\n\n321.\n\nIn its dealings with Claimant, Termoesmeraldas did not exercise governmental authority but acted merely on a commercial basis. Its conduct as a State entity is therefore not attributable to the Ecuadorian State. Whether it misbehaved in its negotiations with Claimant for the purchase of PBII is not for the Tribunal to judge in the absence of attribution of its conduct to the State. Claimant would have had means available under Ecuadorian law to pursue any claims it might have had in that regard.\n\n322.\n\nImposition of fines was CONELEC\u2019s entitlement under the Licence Contract in case of failure by Claimant to commence generating electricity within the prescribed deadline (Article 14.5). This is what occurred. There was no arbitrary treatment of Claimant\u2019s investment by CONELEC\u2019s exercise of a contractual right, as held by another ICSID tribunal in similar situations.361\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizim Ticaret Ve Sanayi A. S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, supra* note 349, para. 197.\n\n323.\n\nFor all the reasons mentioned above, Claimant\u2019s claim of breach of the BIT for arbitrary treatment by Respondent must be dismissed.\n\n**H.** The Expiration of the Charter Party\n------------------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nThe Parties were also asked at the Hearing to indicate whether the Charter Party with Proteus - that was to expire in June 2007 after having been amended - was extended *de facto.* The Parties were specifically asked to explain the relevance of the indication in Ulysseas\u2019 tax returns that its main activity was *\"boat leasing\u2019,* as well as the relevance of the letterhead referring to *\"Proteus\"* and *\"Ulysseas, Associate of Proteus Power, Co. Inc\"*\n\n**1. The Parties\u2019 positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n(i) *Claimant\u2019s contentions*\n----------------------------\n\n325.\n\nClaimant insists that the Charter Party expired on its own terms in July 2005. In Claimant\u2019s view, no evidence whatsoever has been offered to suggest otherwise.362 For this purpose, Claimant relies on Mr. Veldwijk\u2019s testimony, *\"which was not challenged in cross-examination on his evidence that the charter party was not renewed\"363*\n\nCPHS, para. 6.\n\nTranscript, Day 5, pp. 920:8-921:4; Third Witness Statement of Mr. Z. Korn, Exhibit CWS-5.\n\n326.\n\nClaimant also notes that the amendment to the Charter Party was never signed and not even finalized or completed, and contends that *\"the one cited by the Respondent in closing arguments refers to an entirely different barge\"* (PBIII, which was sold on 4 March 2004).364 It also stresses that no payments have been made under the Charter Party since 2004.365\n\nCPHS, paras. 6, 52.\n\n*Id.*\n\n327.\n\nMoreover, Claimant notes that Respondent itself *\"required the owner of PBII to sign* [the PBII Contract.]\" Therefore, Claimant finds it inequitable for Ecuador to argue that Claimant is not the proper party having demanded *\"that the true investor sign the Concession.\"366*\n\nCPHS, para. 53.\n\n328.\n\nAfter the expiration of the Charter Party, Proteus allegedly stayed on as a domestic agent operating the vessel in the country and liaising with the local authorities, which -according to Claimant - *\"explains why both companies are still on the letterhead even after the charter expires.\"367* According to Claimant, Proteus provided services to it under a Services Agreement dated 25 April 2004, by and between Interoil and Claimant.368 Claimant explains that Proteus is still acting as an agent, but it no longer holds the Charter Party: *\"that part of the arrangement that came with the vessel has lapsed and it hasn\u2019t been renewed. Because it is convenient, Ulysseas keeps Proteus on as the agent because the people in Ecuador know them and they are kept on for a period of time\"369*\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 924:15-24.\n\nCPHS, para. 51. Claimant refers to Services Contract Ulysseas, Inc and Interoil, SA (now Proteus Power Ecuador SA), dated 5 (or 25) April 2004, Exhibit C-JURI-45.\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 925:5-11.\n\n329.\n\nAs to the tax returns, Claimant maintains that Respondent has not offered any evidence to suggest there was anything *\"relevant or inappropriate as to how US tax treatment of an investment assists this Tribunal in understanding whether Ulysseas is a qualified investor under the BIT and [... ] that is a jurisdictional point that has already been resolved\"370*\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 926:3-10.\n\n330.\n\nFinally, Claimant refuted in its written pleadings Respondent\u2019s contention that it was not the party which suffered loss.371 In its view, such an accusation ignores the fact that Respondent does not deny that Claimant is the owner of PBII, which is \"an investment in its own right.\" It is also belied by (i) the fact that Ulysseas and not Proteus Power is the counterparty to PBII Contract; (ii) the fact that it was Ulysseas and not Proteus Power (or any other entity) which was attempting to conclude a PPA, and who the various counterparties were negotiating with; (iii) the fact that the Charter Party only governs the conditions of use of PBII between Proteus Power and Claimant and \"[i]t *does not in any way impact or waive any right the Claimant* (qua *owner of the asset) may have against the Respondent\"-,* and (iv) the fact, as already mentioned, that the bareboat Charter Party between Ulysseas and Proteus Power expired by its own terms in July 20 05.372\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 253.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 12. See also Transcript, Day 5, p. 922:7-13.\n\n(ii) *Respondent\u2019s contentions*\n-------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, the *\"the status of the Charter Party is ambiguous and should be presumed to be ongoing\"373* Respondent submits that its view that *\"the record is not complete and [...] there must be more to the parties\u2019 relationship\"* is supported by the amendment to the Charter Party, the schedule of payments and the absence of any paper confirming that Charter Party hire payments were to be made only when the vessel became operational.374\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 155.\n\nTranscript, Day 5, pp. 1017:8-1020:16. See also RPHS, para. 48 (\" *Ulysseas discloses selected and incomplete documentation on its relationship with Proteus Power, and has not always documented that relationship contemporaneously. \").*\n\n332.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant has failed to explain the precise status of the Charter Party. In particular, Claimant has allegedly failed to show whether the Charter Party terminated, and if so on what date and to deny that Proteus Power owes it the balance of the charter hire. In addition, Respondent claims that the record is not consistent with the termination of the Charter Party.375\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 155.\n\n333.\n\nRespondent refers to the changes in Mr. Korn\u2019s statements and to the amendment to the payment schedule of the Charter Party to conclude that Claimant\u2019s own evidence with regard to the alleged termination of the Charter Party *\"is inconsistent and incomplete, and thus at best ambiguous\"376* Respondent also contends that *\"Claimant does not say or show anything to dispel the presumption that Proteus Power still owes the charter hire payments to the Claimant\"377* Moreover, Respondent asserts that *\"Claimant\u2019s evidence is inconsistent with the termination of the Charter Party\"* Respondent observes that Mr. Korn had stated that Proteus Power was to begin payment only upon the commencement of power generation by PBII, which would imply the further extension of the Charter Party\u2019s term.378\n\n*Id.,* paras. 156-161.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 162-164.\n\n*Id.,* para. 165.\n\n334.\n\nRespondent also notes that under the Charter Party agreement between Proteus Power and Ulysseas, Proteus Power - as charterer - held the right of *\"exclusive use, dominion, control, possession and command of said Facility* [PBII]\" in exchange for paying Ulysseas - as owner of PBII - monthly charter hire payments.379 According to Respondent, only Proteus Power, the charterer of PBII, could have had any expectation of a reasonable return from the operations of PBII in Ecuador on those dates.380 Respondent thus concludes that *\"in any event, the Claimant has failed to prove that even if, assuming* arguendo, *the Respondent\u2019s actions deprived the PBII project of all value, the Claimant was the entity that suffered as a result\"381*\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 253; Statement of Rejoinder, para. 149.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 112.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 253.\n\n335.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant\u2019s own evidence undermines its contention that Proteus Power is its agent. Respondent refers to the following events: *\"(i) Prime asks the shareholders of Proteus Power, not Ulysseas, to authorise a November 2008 deal envisaging the sale of PBII; (ii) Ulysseas\u2019s unaudited balance sheets do not mention PBII;*\n\n*(iii) Ulysseas\u2019s U.S. tax returns describe its business as boat leasing; (iv) Dr. Restrepo, Ulysseas\u2019s representative and lawyer, fails to mention the supposed agency in his response to the Chairman; and (v) 2006 invoices are made out to Proteus Power with no documents connecting them to Ulysseas\"382*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRPHS, para. 47.\n\n336.\n\nFinally, Respondent claims that this unexplained relationship is relevant because fair and equitable treatment *\"does require a degree of openness and candour on the part of the investor as well as the State\"383* In particular, Respondent contends that, if Claimant describes its business as boat leasing for the purposes of paying taxes, then it should also call itself a boat leaser when it deals with Respondent.384 By invoking legitimate and reasonable reliance, Respondent states that *\"if an investor wants to legitimately and reasonably rely on what it can expect in the host country, it must act consistently just as much as the host state must\"385*\n\nTranscript, Day 5, p. 1023:1-7.\n\nId., p. 1023:10-24.\n\nId., p. 1024:1-6.\n\n**2. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion**\n--------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThere is no evidence in the file that the bareboat Charter Party was extended beyond its original duration. Respondent\u2019s claim under this head must be dismissed.\n\n**I.** Compensation Due for **BIT** Violations\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties\u2019 positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n(i) *Claimant\u2019s contentions*\n----------------------------\n\n338.\n\nClaimant refers to the standard in the *Chorzow Factory Case* to assert that the compensation due for the harm caused by Respondent should amount to *restitutio in integrum386* In Claimant\u2019s view *fair value -* and not *fair market value -* is the relevant reference in this case, since *fair value \"has been recognized as a valid guidepost for damages for breach of national treatment and violations other than expropriation, as it reflects the value to the specific investor when that value might be outside the fair market value of an investment\"387*\n\nStatement of Reply, paras. 123-124.\n\nCPHS, para. 57; *The Factory at Chorzow,* Merits, 1928, PCIJ Series A, No. 17, Exhibit CLA2.\n\n339.\n\nIn order to calculate the loss of its investment, Claimant relies on a *\"lease model\",* an approach consisting of treating *\"the Respondent\u2019s effective conversion of the Claimant\u2019s investment into part of the State infrastructure, as though it were a \u2018lease to own\u2019 scheme\"388* In Claimant\u2019s view, such a model represents *\"the best alternative method for producing a realistic damages calculation\"* and is fairer than a DCF method.389\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 113-115.\n\nStatement of Reply, paras. 123-124.\n\n340.\n\nAccording to Mr. Walck, on whose reports Claimant\u2019s contentions are based, Claimant\u2019s damages amount to a total of USD 49,834 million. Claimant links Respondent\u2019s abandonment of the power sector as it existed to the alleged breaches of Respondent\u2019s promise to afford Claimant\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security, Respondent\u2019s promise not to engage in indirect expropriation and Respondent\u2019s promise to afford Claimant protection from discriminatory treatment.390 Claimant\u2019s claim, inclusive of principal and interest stands at not less than USD 57 million.391\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 115-116. See also Letter from Claimant dated 29 November 2011, p. 2.\n\nLetter from Claimant dated 29 November 2011, p. 2.\n\n341.\n\nAlternatively, Claimant claims damages of USD 15,066 million for having lost the use of PBII for a period of a year and an amount of USD 7 million for the physical damage inflicted by Respondent\u2019s agents to PBII.392 With regard to the alleged arbitrary treatment, Claimant further claims such damages *\"as the Tribunal may deem appropriate\"393* As explained by Mr. Walck during the hearing, the alleged damages for the loss of the use of PBII and the physical damage caused to the barge are subsumed within Claimant\u2019s principal claim, since they refer to a certain period of time within a claim for permanent deprivation of its investment.394\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 120.\n\n*Id.*\n\nTranscript, Day 4, pp. 818:21-822:12.\n\n342.\n\nClaimant\u2019s damages include an interest component using an interest rate of 15%, since *\"independent publications were using a rate in this range for comparable transactions in this part of the world'* and *\"Ecuador\u2019s own bonds in this period yielded about 15 per cent, slightly over.\"395* In Claimant\u2019s view, this interest should accrue from 1 January 2008 until 10 October 2011.396 In addition, Claimant argues that only compound interest would offer full restitution of the loss suffered. In Claimant\u2019s opinion, Ecuadorian domestic law is irrelevant on this point and, *\"as a general matter simple interest is only appropriate for short periods.\"397*\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 74:15-23.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 117; Supplemental Expert Reply Report of Richard E. Walck.\n\nStatement of Reply, paras. 127-128. Transcript, Day 1, p. 74:24-75:5.\n\n343.\n\nClaimant also addresses the issue of causation to conclude that *\"Respondent is the proximate cause of the Claimant\u2019s loss\"* It describes the list of actions through which Respondent allegedly breached the BIT promises and states that *\"in each instance the Respondent was aware of the Claimant\u2019s investment and must have been aware of the likely negative impact\"398*\n\n*Id.,* para. 116.\n\n344.\n\nFinally, Claimant refers to Respondent\u2019s complaint about the inclusion of dry docking, personnel charges and certain facilities. Claimant argues that dry docking is an *\"essential part\"* of the maintenance of any vessel and it is thus included in its fixed costs; that personnel charges are included as *\"Claimant was required to bear them\"* and, in relation to the inclusion of various facilities, Claimant concludes that \"ha[ving] *deprived the* *Claimant of the entire value of its investment,* [Respondent] *should not be entitled to cherry pick which parts of the investment it is to be held accountable for\"399*\n\n*Id., para.* 126.\n\n(ii) *Respondent\u2019s contentions*\n-------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant\u2019s request for damages has no basis. In particular, Respondent argues that the Charter Party remains in force *{supra* para. 331), and thus concludes that *\"Claimant is unable to point any prejudice arising from any actions of the Respondent\"400* In Respondent\u2019s view, the unexplained relationship between Proteus Power and Claimant renders any loss to Claimant speculative, precluding damages.401 Respondent argues that, even though under PBII Contract Claimant had the nominal right to operate the barge, that right *\"was assigned or otherwise conferred onto Proteus Power under the terms of the Charter Party\"402* Respondent relies on *RoslnvestCo* for the proposition that at international law, the rules concerning international claims have consistently protected *\"only the real, equitable or beneficial interest in property or an enterprise, not the interest of the bare or nominal owner\"403*\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 358.\n\nRPHS, para. 47.\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 153.\n\n*Id.,* para. 151; *RoslnvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation,* Final Award, dated 12 September 2010, SCC Case No. Arb. V079/2005, Exhibit RLA57.\n\n346.\n\nRespondent also observes that Mr. Walck includes a personnel charge in his calculations of damages, despite Claimant never having obtained an employer registration number in Ecuador. In Respondent\u2019s view, *\"Claimant\u2019s quantum claim should therefore be dismissed outright as inadmissible \"404*\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 359.\n\n347.\n\nIn addition, Respondent contends that Claimant has failed to prove that Respondent\u2019s alleged BIT violations caused it any injury. Respondent argues that Claimant is not entitled to damages because it has not shown that Respondent caused it any loss or injury and it notes that Claimant *\"assumes without any basis that any BIT breach entails total loss of use of PBII, declining to show any causal link between any non-expropriation* *breach and the extent of injury, if any.\"405* In Respondent\u2019s view, *\"rather than proving any link between supposed wrongful conduct and supposed injury, the Claimant would like the Respondent simply to pay for what the Claimant\u2019s business \u2018should have been. \"\u2019406*\n\nRPHS, para. 41.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 362.\n\n348.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent argues that Claimant has not shown loss due to an alleged *\"inability to recover operating costs or to withdraw its investment\"* Respondent insists that Claimant has always been allowed to generate electricity and to employ the available legal means to enforce payments of any credits for sale of power, that it has always been allowed a high payment preference, and that it has never been denied the ability to withdraw its investment.407 Respondent also notes that Claimant has failed to show loss due to the *\"opportunity of signing a PPA or selling the barge)408* Finally, Respondent explains that Claimant has not been able to show loss due to the alleged depression of its collection potential or due to the physical occupation of PBII and alleged damage to the barge.409\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 173.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 174-175.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 175-177.\n\n349.\n\nLastly, Respondent criticises Claimant\u2019s approach on *quantum,* deeming the lease model unhelpful and arguing that Claimant should not be awarded damages for uncertain loss.410 Regarding the lease model, Respondent makes four basic points. First, in Respondent\u2019s view, the lease model is more of a *\"hypothetical business that has never existed'* rather than an approximation to what would have happened in reality to Claimant had it attempted to generate. Second, according to Respondent, the lease model does not resemble the business model of a power generation company, but rather is more similar to the bareboat leasing model of the Charter Party. Third, Respondent considers that the value attributed by Mr. Walck to PBII (USD 22 million) is based on valuing PBII as if it were a new asset. Fourth, Mr. Walck refuses to acknowledge Claimant\u2019s land facilities and the possibility of recovering their value.411 In addition, Respondent notes that Claimant\u2019s damages calculation is based on some assumptions that *\"findno support on the record,\"412*\n\n*Id.,* para. 178.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 179-183. Statement of Defence, paras. 375-376.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 377.\n\n350.\n\nWith respect to the alleged uncertainty of the loss, Respondent observes that arbitral tribunals *\"have consistently required a reasonable degree of certainty for awarding compensation for future profits\"413* In its view, the *\"speculative character\"* of seeking compensation for future profit when a project has no history of revenues should make the Tribunal refrain from compensating Claimant. Respondent further argues that, even if the Tribunal were inclined to award compensation to Claimant for its purported loss, both the amount of compensation and the awarding of interest should be moderated by the requirement of certainty. In this regard, Respondent notes that simple interest would satisfy the requirements of both international and Ecuadorian law.414\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 186; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

The Tribunal\u2019s conclusions**\n---------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nIn the absence of any BIT violations by Respondent, no compensation is due to Claimant.\n\n**CHAPTER IV - THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 3, the Parties submitted on February 29, 2012 their applications for costs.\n\n**1. The Parties\u2019 positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n(i) *Claimant\u2019s contentions*\n----------------------------\n\n353.\n\nIn its costs application, Claimant requests that the Tribunal, in accordance with Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules, *\"award costs on the basis of the parties\u2019 relative success on the merits of the case\"415* Pursuant to this principle Claimant claims the entire sum of its *\"reasonable legal fees, disbursements and other expenses incurred in the matter to date\"416*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Cost Application, p. 1.\n\n*Id.*\n\n354.\n\nIn addition, Claimant argues that, irrespective of the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the overall merits of the case, *\"it should be entitled to recover its costs of both the disclosure* *phase of this matter and, more significantly, the jurisdiction phase* \"417 Claimant\u2019s position is based on two arguments. First, it contends that the vast majority of the document production requests were resolved in its favor or with the Tribunal accepting that Claimant\u2019s offer of production was adequate. Second, it argues that Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections *\"were decisively held to be badly founded\"* In its view, those objections *\"unnecessarily delayed matters and raised the costs of the proceedings significantly\"* and therefore *\"it is particularly appropriate that the Respondent bear the Claimant\u2019s cost of the jurisdictional phase \"418*\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id,* p. 2.\n\n355.\n\nClaimant claims, in relation to its costs of legal representation and assistance in the arbitration, USD 5,185,928.67 in total, comprising of USD 3,590,662.32 for legal fees and USD 1,595,266.35 for disbursements and other expenses.419\n\n*Id.,* p. 3.\n\n(ii) *Respondent\u2019s contentions*\n-------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nIn its costs application, Respondent notes that the UNCITRAL Rules recognize the prevailing party principle, but *\"generally grant the Tribunal broad discretion\"420* In addition, Respondent indicates that pursuant to Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules the Tribunal has full discretion to take into account the circumstances of the case to order one party to bear the costs of legal representation and assistance or to apportion them as it determines to be reasonable.421\n\nRespondent\u2019s Application for Costs, para. 8.\n\n*Id.,* 8-11.\n\n357.\n\nRespondent considers that, if its claims prevail, it should be entitled to its reasonable costs, including its cost of legal representation. However, even if its claims do not prevail entirely, Respondent argues that it should still be entitled to a reasonable apportionment of costs in its favor.422\n\n*Id.,* para. 12.\n\n358.\n\nOn the assumption that all claims are dismissed, Respondent argues that *\"there are strong circumstances in this case that justify an order of costs against Ulysseas,\"* including the fact that Claimant had other remedies available to it and exacerbated the dispute and its damages through its conduct.423 In Respondent\u2019s view, such an apportionment of costs in its favor should not be altered by the fact that the Tribunal did not accept Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections because it was necessary to determine whether the promise contained in PBII Contract that Claimant would not make international claims had been made only to CONELEC or also to Respondent and the ownership and control of Claimant was completely opaque at the outset of the proceedings.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 13-18.\n\n359.\n\nEven if Respondent does not prevail entirely, it claims that it should be entitled to a reasonable apportionment of the arbitration costs in its favor because Claimant can only prevail *\"in part, at the most\"* and Claimant\u2019s conduct has caused Respondent to incur unnecessary extra arbitration costs.424 In this regard, Respondent argues that Claimant has failed to pursue a substantial portion of its claims, having forced Claimant *\"to incur substantial yet wasted costs in preparing to defend them\"425* In particular, Respondent notes that Claimant claimed in its Notice of Dispute and Notice of Arbitration, and confirmed afterwards in the Terms of Appointment that it claimed that (i) Respondent had expropriated PBI; (ii) Claimant was entitled to damages for berthing expenses prior to Las Esclusas; and (iii) Claimant owed no outstanding amounts to PETROCOMERCIAL and CONELEC\u2019s contractual penalties were invalid.426 However, Respondent asserts that Claimant has completely failed to rebut *\"or even respond\u2019* to Respondent\u2019s argument or evidence conclusively disproving these claims.427 In Respondent\u2019s view, those claims must be deemed abandoned and dismissed with prejudice.\n\n*Id.,* para. 12.\n\n*Id.,* para. 21.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.,* paras. 22-30; Statement of Defence, paras. 66-78.\n\n360.\n\nIn addition, Respondent accuses Claimant of *\"unnecessarily wasteful conduct\"* that has caused Respondent to incur additional costs.428 In particular, Respondent contends that (i) Claimant resisted disclosing its full relation with Prime, Elliot Associates and the Synergy Group,429 (ii) Claimant misled its evidence on the PBII Charter Party and the role of Proteus Power,430 and (iii) Claimant introduced new arguments and documentary evidence in an untimely fashion just prior to the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Brief.431 Respondent further asserts that numerous unsupported factual allegations were made by Claimant, that Claimant introduced documents that it had erroneously redacted and that it *\"unnecessarily resisted'* Respondent\u2019s request to provide certain powers of attorney.432\n\n*Id.,* para. 5.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 32-35.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 36-39.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 40-41. Respondent refers to Various entries from Log Book of PBII, dated 2010, Exhibit C270 and to Certificate from Gateway Transit Ltd., attached as Exhibit B to Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 42-47.\n\n361.\n\nRespondent claims a total amount of USD 6,297,557.44, including the arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses, the administrative costs, the cost of producing expert and witness evidence and costs of legal representation and assistance, including the costs incurred by Ecuador\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office for this matter and its costs for outside counsel. Respondent also seeks an award of interest on any costs awarded in its favor, from the date of the award until full payment by Claimant. In Respondent\u2019s view, *\"simple interest at LIBOR would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances\"433*\n\n*Id.,* paras. 50-53.\n\n**2. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis and conclusion**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nArticle 38 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules states that the arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award and defines the term \"costs\" as including only:\n\n*\"a. The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;*\n\n*b. The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;*\n\n*c. The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;*\n\n*d. The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;*\n\n*e. The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;*\n\n*f. Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the* *Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\"*\n\n363.\n\nAccording to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case. According to Article 40(2) regarding specifically the costs of legal representation and assistance, the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, is free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n364.\n\nAmong the circumstances of the case that the Tribunal has taken into account is its finding that Claimant has been successful as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal while Respondent has been successful as to the merits of the case.\n\n365.\n\nTaking all the circumstances of the case into account, the Tribunal decides as follows. Each Party shall pay one half of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of the PCA and that Claimant shall bear its own costs for legal representation and assistance. Having examined each Party\u2019s costs, the Tribunal has determined that the amount of Respondent\u2019s costs for legal representation and assistance is reasonable. Claimant shall reimburse Respondent\u2019s costs for legal representation and assistance in the amount of USD 2,000,000.00 (two million United States dollars). This amount shall be paid within 30 (thirty) days following receipt of the Award, failing which simple interest shall run on such amount at LIBOR (annual), as requested by Respondent.434\n\n*Id.,* para. 52.\n\n366.\n\nUnder Article 41(5) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal has to render an accounting of the deposits received. The advances made by the Parties to cover the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of the PCA are as follows:\n\nClaimant: EUR 425,000.00\n\nRespondent: EUR 425,000.00\n\n367.\n\nThe advances having being paid in equal shares, there shall be no settlement between the Parties in that regard.\n\n368.\n\nThe total costs for fees and expenses regarding the arbitrators and PCA are fixed at EUR 778,100.62, divided as follows:\n\nProf. Piero Bernardini: EUR 255,675.00 (fees), EUR 8,698.40 (expenses)\n\nProf. Michael Pryles: EUR 149,887.50 (fees), EUR 15,653.27 (expenses)\n\nProf. Brigitte Stern: EUR 125,475.00 (fees), EUR 32,425.19 (expenses/VAT)\n\nPCA: EUR 76,353.69\n\nTribunal expenses: EUR 113,932.57\n\n369.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 respective portions of these tribunal costs, amounting to EUR 389,050.31 for each side, shall be deducted from the deposit and the PCA shall reimburse the amount of EUR 35,949.69 to each side in accordance with Article 41(5) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n**CHAPTER V - PRAYER FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nClaimant\u2019s prayer for relief is as follows:\n\n*\"Claimant claims'.*\n\n(1) *damages in the amount of not less than US$ 56.1 MILLION;*\n\n(2) *pre and post judgement interest assessed on a compound basis and at a rate of 15%, and running from 1 January 2008;*\n\n(3) *its legal and other costs of bringing these proceedings; and*\n\n(4) *such other relief that the Tribunal finds to be just and proper.\"435*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 124.\n\n371.\n\nRespondent\u2019s prayer for relief is as follows:\n\n*\"The Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal enter a decision'.*\n\n(1) *That the Respondent has not breached any of its obligations under the BIT in relation to the Claimant\u2019s investment;*\n\n(2) *Rejecting all of the Claimant\u2019s investment;*\n\n(3) *Ordering the Claimant to pay all of the Respondent\u2019s costs associated with these proceedings, including the arbitrators \u2019fees and administrative costs, and the legal costs (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred by the Respondent, in an amount to be quantified; and*\n\n(4) *Ordering any other relief that the Tribunal sees fit.\"436*\n\nStatement of Rejoinder, para. 189.\n\n**CHAPTER VI - DISPOSITIVE PART OF THE DECISION**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n372.\n\nHaving carefully considered the Parties\u2019 arguments in their written and oral submissions as well as the evidence produced by each of them, for all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously decides and orders as follows:\n\n(1) Respondent has not breached any of its obligations under the BIT in relation to Claimant\u2019s investment;\n\n(2) All of Claimant\u2019s claims in that regard are dismissed;\n\n(3) The Parties shall share equally all fees and expenses of the Tribunal as well as PCA\u2019s fees and expenses, which are paid out of the advances made by the Parties;\n\n(4) Claimant is ordered to pay to Respondent the sum of USD 2,000,000.00 (two million United States dollars) on account of Respondent\u2019s costs for legal representation and assistance, increased by simple interest at LIBOR (annual) from the date of receipt by Claimant of this Award in case of failure to make payment within 30 (thirty) days from said award receipt;\n\n(5) The PCA shall reimburse EUR 35,949.69 to each Party in respect of the unexpended balance of the deposit;\n\n(6) All other claims and requests by the Parties are dismissed."}]}
