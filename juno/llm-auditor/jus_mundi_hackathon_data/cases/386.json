Yves Fortier CC, OC, QC as arbitrator. By letter dated 18 February 2011, the Respondents appointed Dr. Bernard Hanotiau as arbitrator. On 30 March 2011, the co-arbitrators appointed Mr. David A. R. Williams QC as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n5.\n\nOn 13 July 2011, following an exchange of correspondence between the Parties in May and June 2011, and a procedural telephone conference on 22 June 2011, the Tribunal circulated for the Parties' comments the minutes of the procedural conference, the draft Terms of Appointment, and a draft Procedural Order No.1. The Tribunal also informed the Parties of the appointment of Mr. Epaminontas Triantafilou, Legal Counsel at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"**PCA**\"), as Secretary to the Tribunal.4 Mr. Triantafilou confirmed his independence and impartiality by letter dated 14 July 2011. By e-mail dated 4 May 2012, the Tribunal appointed Ms. Olga Boltenko, Legal Counsel at the PCA, to replace Mr. Triantafilou as Secretary to the Tribunal as of 1 June 2012.\n\nThe Parties had previously agreed to case administration by the PCA and to the appointment as Secretary to the Tribunal of a member of the PCA's staff: see the Claimants' e-mail to the Tribunal of 30 June 2011 and the Respondents' e-mail to the Tribunal of 1 July 2011.\n\n6.\n\nOn 21 July 2011, the Respondents submitted their Memorandum on Bifurcation.\n\n7.\n\nOn 26 July 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, setting forth, among other procedural matters, a timetable for submissions and a date for the hearing on bifurcation of the proceedings.5\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, para. 2.\n\n8.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal circulated a finalized version of the Terms of Appointment to the Parties. Article 4 of the Terms of Appointment describes the applicable procedural rules as follows:\n\n4.1 In accordance with Article 26 of the Treaty and Article 12 of the Founding Agreement, the parties agree that the proceedings shall be conducted under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010.\n\n4.2 For issues not dealt with in the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010, the Tribunal shall apply the rules that the Parties have agreed upon. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the rules it deems appropriate.6\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 4.\n\n9.\n\nThe Parties elected English as the language of arbitration and Paris as the place of arbitration. The PCA was chosen to act as Registry.7\n\nTerms of Appointment, paras. 7, 9-10.\n\n10.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties made submissions on bifurcation in the course of July, August, and September 2011. A hearing on bifurcation was held on 19 September 2011 in Paris. The Parties submitted post-hearing briefs on bifurcation on 26 September 2011.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated 4 October 2011, the Respondents informed the Tribunal, and the Claimants confirmed, that the Parties had reached agreement on the procedural issues that had been submitted for determination by the Tribunal during the hearing on bifurcation. More specifically, the Parties agreed \"to having all of the [c]laims heard and resolved in a single, consolidated proceeding before this Tribunal\" and \"to having the Tribunal hear all of Respondents' remaining objections to jurisdiction in a separate jurisdictional phase, according to the schedule set forth in Section 3A of Procedural Order No. 1.\"\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal endorsed and confirmed the Parties' agreement in Procedural Order No. 2, dated 6 October 2011.\n\n13.\n\nOn 24 October 2011, Ma\u00eetre Fortier disclosed that his law firm, Norton Rose OR, would, on 1 January 2012, merge with the firm Macleod Dixon, and that Macleod Dixon was acting for Atomredmetzoloto JSC, a company being sued in the courts of Ontario, Canada by Khan Canada. Ma\u00eetre Fortier informed the Parties that he had no knowledge with respect to this lawsuit and that he would resign from Norton Rose OR as of 31 December 2011. On the same date, the Parties indicated that they had no objections to Ma\u00eetre Fortier's continued participation in these proceedings.\n\n14.\n\nOn 2 December 2011, the Respondents submitted their Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"**Memorial**\").\n\n15.\n\nOn 6 February 2012, the Claimants submitted their Counter-memorial on Jurisdiction (\"**Counter-memorial**\"), together with the witness statement of Mr. Grant A. Edey (\"**Edey Statement**\") and the expert report on Mongolian law of Mr. Tsogt Natsagdorj (\"**Tsogt Report**\").\n\n16.\n\nOn 14 March 2012, the Respondents submitted their Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"**Reply**\").\n\n17.\n\nOn 23 April 2012, the Claimants submitted their Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"**Rejoinder**\"). On 4 May 2012, the Claimants filed Exhibit C-121, which had come into existence after the Rejoinder was submitted.\n\n18.\n\nIn early May, the Parties corresponded and agreed on most of the logistical arrangements for the hearing on jurisdiction scheduled for 14 May 2012. On 11 May 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, confirming the agreed arrangements and ruling that \"the party calling the witness would in first instance bear the cost of the interpreter.\"8 In Annex A to Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal listed, without in any way limiting the right of counsel to present their cases as they saw fit, issues that the Tribunal suggested deserved particular attention at the hearing.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, para. 1.3.\n\n19.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction was held at the ICC Hearing Center in Paris on 14 May 2012. Present at the hearing were:\n\nTribunal :\n\nDr. Bernard Hanotiau  \n Ma\u00eetre L.Yves Fortier CC, OC, QC  \n Mr. David A.R.Williams QC\n\nThe Claimants :\n\nMr. Ian A.

A full transcript of the hearing was made by court reporter Ms. Yvonne Vanvi, and circulated to the Tribunal and the Parties on 16 May 2012.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\nA. THE DORNOD PROJECT\n---------------------\n\n21.\n\nFrom 1988, commencing under the communist Mongolian People's Republic, to 1995, the Russian state-owned company Priargunsky Production Mining and Chemical Enterprise (\"**Priargunsky**\") extracted uranium oxide from an open pit mine located in Dornod, a province in the north-east of Mongolia.9 Due to a shortage of funds and a drop in demand for uranium after the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. in 1991, the mine was shut down in mid-1995.10\n\nMemorial, para. 13; Counter-memorial, paras. 36, 38; Hearing Transcript 16:10-13.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 36.\n\n22.\n\nAround the same time, Priargunsky and the Mongolian state-owned company Mongol-Erdene (\"**Erdene**\") formed a joint venture known as the Central Asian Uranium Company (\"**CAUC**\") with the U.S. company WM Mining Inc. (\"**WM Mining**\"), in order to develop a uranium exploration and extraction project in Dornod (\"**Dornod Project**\").\n\n23.\n\nThe founders of CAUC executed three following documents: (i) the Founding Agreement, (ii) the Agreement on Development of Mineral Deposits in Eastern Aimak of Mongolia (\"**Minerals Agreement**\"), and (iii) the Charter of the Company with Limited liability \"Central Asian Uranium Company of Mongolia of the Mongolian-Russian-American Venture\" (\"**Charter**\").11 The Minerals Agreement was also signed by an authorized representative of the Mongolian Ministry of Energy, Geology, and Mining.12 Under these agreements, WM Mining undertook to contribute financial capital to the Dornod Project.13\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 40, 42, referring to Exhibits C-17a-c, C-18a-b.\n\nHearing Transcript 17:10-19, referring to Exhibit C-17A.\n\nMemorial, para. 14; Counter-memorial, para. 38.\n\n24.\n\nInitially, each of the three parties held an equal 33.3 percent share of the joint venture. On 12 December 1996, WM Mining's participation in CAUC was increased to 58 percent with Erdene and Priargunsky each maintaining a 21 percent share.14 Thereafter, Erdene's share in CAUC was successively transferred to the Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia (\"**MRAM**\") on 27 November 2001, the State Property Committee of Mongolia (\"**SPC**\") on 28 March 2005, and MonAtom, a Mongolian company wholly owned and controlled by the SPC, in 2009.15 MonAtom itself was incorporated in 2009.16\n\nMemorial, para. 15; Counter-memorial, para. 65.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 56, 62, 68.\n\nHearing Transcript 10:19-21.\n\n25.\n\nIn July 1997, WM Mining transferred its shares to the British Virgin Islands company World Wide Mongolia Mining Inc.17 This company was acquired by Khan Canada on 30-31 July 2003, through Khan Canada's newly incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary Khan Resources Bermuda Ltd (\"**Khan Bermuda**\").18 Khan Canada had been incorporated in Ontario, Canada on 1 October 2002, with the sole purpose, according to the Claimants, of investing in Mongolia.19 Following Khan Canada's acquisition of World Wide Mongolia Mining Inc., the latter was renamed CAUC Holding on 28 April 2004.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 65.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 84-85.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 81; Hearing Transcript 18:11-13.\n\n26.\n\nWhen this arbitration commenced in 2011, Priargunsky and MonAtom each held a 21 percent share in CAUC, while CAUC Holding, the wholly owned subsidiary of Khan Bermuda, in turn the wholly owned subsidiary of Khan Canada, held the remaining 58 percent share in CAUC.\n\n27.\n\nOn 27 March 2003, Khan Canada established a separate subsidiary incorporated in Mongolia -Khan Resources LLC (\"**Khan Mongolia**\") - to help coordinate its activities in Mongolia.20 Originally, all of the shares in Khan Mongolia were held by Khan Bermuda.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 86; Hearing Transcript 18:16-17.\n\n28.\n\nOn 5 September 2007, Khan Canada incorporated Khan Netherlands for the specific purpose of holding Khan Mongolia.21 On 29 May 2008, the Foreign Investment and Trade Agency of Mongolia (\"**FIFTA**\") issued a \"Certificate of Foreign Incorporated Company\" recording the transfer of 75 percent of the shares in Khan Mongolia to Khan Netherlands and indicating that the other 25 percent remained with Khan Bermuda.22\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 123. At the hearing, the Respondents stated that Khan Netherlands was incorporated on 4 January 2008, referring to the date of an excerpt of the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce trade register; however, this document also states that the date of the \"incorporation deed\" is 5 September 2007 (Hearing Transcript 22:4-5; Exhibit C-116a/C-116b).\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 123-124, referring to Exhibit C-99; Hearing Transcript 15:15-16:2.\n\n29.\n\nOn 10 November 1998, the joint venture company CAUC obtained the mineral exploration license 237A (\"**Mining License**\"), which allowed CAUC to engage in the exploitation of radioactive mineral resources on a specific area of land in the Dornod region.23\n\nMemorial, para. 17, referring to Exhibit R-4; Counter-memorial, paras. 115-116.\n\n30.\n\nOn 22 April 2005, Khan Mongolia, then wholly-owned by Khan Canada through Khan Bermuda, obtained the mineral exploration license 9282X (\"**Exploration License,**\" collectively with the Mining License, the \"**Mining and Exploration Licenses**\"), which allowed it to conduct radioactive mineral exploration within the boundaries of an area of land neighbouring the one covered by the Mining License.24\n\nMemorial, para. 20, referring to Exhibit R-6; Counter-memorial, para. 120. While observing that this is not relevant to the Tribunal's determination on jurisdiction, the Claimants argue in their Counter-memorial that, contrary to the Respondents' assertion, the areas covered by the Mining and Exploration Licenses are not \"two distinct, albeit adjacent projects,\" but \"a single mining project,\" which came to be known under two names and covered by two mining licenses due to a surveying error. Accordingly, the Claimants submit that Khan Canada acquired the Exploration License \"for the purpose of benefiting all of the joint venture partners,\" with the intention to \"merge\" the Mining and Exploration Licenses in due course. At the hearing, the Claimants referred to Exhibit C-39, the minutes of a CAUC shareholders' meeting, noting that Khan Canada would have to include the Exploration License to ensure the \"effective, efficient and sustainable operation\" of the project (Hearing Transcript 146:24-149:8). In their Rejoinder, the Claimants further argue that the Respondents' failure to include any documentary evidence or rebuttal on this matter in their Reply should preclude any further attempts by the Respondents to describe the Mining and Exploration Licenses as unrelated or unconnected (Counter-memorial, paras. 111-122; Rejoinder, paras. 28-29).\n\n31.\n\nAs background to their decision to invest in Mongolia, the Claimants allege that in recent years Mongolia's economy has become one of the \"fastest growing in the world\" due to its mineral wealth and a twenty-plus year campaign to \"lure foreign investment to the country\" by creating \"the appearance of a positive investment environment by enacting laws and entering contracts that, at least on their face, promise a high level of protection to foreign investors.\"25\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 25-34.\n\n32.\n\nIn reply, the Respondents state that the allegation that Mongolia sought to lure investment by a deceptive foreign policy is neither credible not substantiated. After its transition into democracy in 1990, Mongolia spent considerable time and effort to encourage foreign investment. It now benefits from a good reputation among investors. In this context, Mongolia continues \"to act lawfully and in full legitimacy.\"26\n\nReply, paras. 42-45.\n\nB. THE CLAIMANTS' INVESTMENT IN THE DORNOD PROJECT\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the extent to which the Claimants invested in the Dornod Project.27\n\nThe Respondents emphasise that they do not consider the issue of valuation of the Claimants' investment to be pertinent to the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings, but nonetheless address this issue in their submissions.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the Claimants have not carried out any ore production at the sites covered by the Exploration and Mining Licenses, and that, once Khan Canada obtained an indirect shareholding in CAUC, it \"floated its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2008, generating millions of dollars in capital,\" the benefit of which was never seen in Mongolia.28\n\nMemorial, paras. 5, 19, 31\n\n35.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the Claimants' contention that they invested over USD 50 million in the project is not borne out by the thousands of pages of factual evidence they have produced. The Respondents argue that the Claimants have in fact made inconsistent estimates of the value of their investment.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondents note that Khan Canada's 2007 Annual Report states that Khan Canada did not intend to make any substantial investments until an investment agreement was concluded with Mongolia. This was confirmed by Mr. Martin Quick, Khan Canada's then President and C.E.O., in an interview following Khan Canada's entry on the Toronto Stock Exchange.29 In 2010, the Claimants claimed before the Mongolian Capital City Administrative Court (\"**Administrative Court**\") to have made an investment of more than USD 10 million. In a letter sent in April 2010 to the Mongolian Prime Minister, the Claimants' valuation of their investment had increased to USD 20 million. In this arbitration, the Claimants seek compensation in the amount of USD 200 million.30\n\nHearing Transcript 21:1-22:2.\n\nReply, paras. 31-36.\n\n37.\n\nAs for the surveys allegedly carried out by the Claimants, the Respondents assert that the resulting reports either repeated or copied information collected during the period when Priargunsky operated the Dornod site.31\n\nReply, paras. 37-41, referring to Exhibit C-50.\n\n38.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants allege that, starting in 2004, Khan made \"considerable and significant progress on the exploration and development\" of the Dornod Project.32 Initially, the Claimants spent time raising money through private investment fundings and on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and complying with Mongolian legal and regulatory requirements necessary for Khan Canada to acquire the CAUC shares.33 The Claimants allege that Khan then spent more than USD 50 million toward the Dornod Project, and contributed valuable intellectual capital and technical expertise.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 86.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 86, 93; Rejoinder, para. 27.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimants contend that when Khan Canada joined the project, the joint venture was running on a \"care and maintenance\" basis, and could not move forward without Khan Canada's financial and technical investment.34\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 89.\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize that Khan Canada's 2011 consolidated audited financial statements confirm a cumulative deficit (from 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2011) of USD 46,438,000. Combined with Khan Canada's long-term assets of over USD 15 million (capital assets plus mineral interests), the amount expended on the Dornod Project is well in excess of USD 50 million.35\n\nRejoinder, para. 36, referring to Exhibit C-114.\n\n41.\n\nIn particular, Khan confirmed the existence and extent of the uranium reserves in the Dornod site by conducting a magnetometer and gravity survey, as well as an extensive program of drilling and metallurgical testing, beginning in early 2005.36\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 94, referring to Exhibit C-50.\n\n42.\n\nKhan also assessed and refined the economic and technical parameters necessary to determine the economic viability of the project by conducting four \"difficult, time-consuming, and costly\" studies providing an extensive analysis of, among other, the resources and reserves at the site and the costs and methodologies required to exploit the mine in an economically feasible manner.37\n\nThe studies are the \"Amended NI 43-101 Report on the Dornod uranium project\" (September 2005), the \"Scoping Study\" (2006), the \"Pre-Feasibility Study\" (August 2007), and the \"Definitive Feasibility Study\" (May 2009) (Counter-memorial, paras. 95-97, referring to Exhibits C-50, C-58, C-59, C-60, C-61.)\n\n43.\n\nIn addition, Khan retained and funded expert firms to conduct various environmental and social assessments, and devoted funds to infrastructure construction in Mongolia.38 The Claimants add that they have shared all their reports and studies with Mongolia.39\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 98; Hearing Transcript 97:22-98:11.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 100; Rejoinder, para. 33, referring to Exhibits C-64, C-65.\n\n44.\n\nWith regard to the Respondents' allegation that the Claimants' exploration work reproduced surveys carried out when Priargunsky operated the Dornod site, the Claimants acknowledge that significant exploration data was developed by Priargunsky before 1995, but explain that the data was not verifiable or reproducible because the underlying exploration material (*e.g.*, the drill core) was destroyed when Priargunsky abandoned the site. Thus, over 8,000 metres of additional drilling was performed to verify and expand upon the data collected by Priargunsky. Moreover, according to the Claimants, Priargunsky had neither conducted any social and environmental impact assessments, nor developed mining plans or engineered processing and support facilities.40\n\nRejoinder, paras. 30-31.\n\n45.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants dispute the Respondents' allegation that the Claimants did not share the results of their studies with Mongolia, submitting that had Khan's studies duplicated Priargunsky's work, there would have been no need for Khan to share results with Mongolia.41\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 100; Rejoinder, para. 32.\n\nC. THE INVALIDATION OF THE MINING AND EXPLORATION LICENSES\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn April 2005 and April 2009, the State Specialised Inspection Agency of Mongolia (\"**SSIA**\") inspected the Dornod site. In July 2009, the SSIA issued a report raising a number of alleged violations of Mongolian law by CAUC in connection to its mining operations in Dornod (\"**July 2009 Report**\"). The same month, the MRAM informed CAUC that the Mining License was temporarily suspended due to the results of the 2009 SSIA inspection and, in the Respondents' view, to Khan's failure to remedy the alleged legal violations.42\n\nMemorial, paras. 23-25, referring to Exhibits R-8, R-9; Counter-memorial, paras. 133-134; Hearing Transcript 19:11-14, 22:18-25.\n\n47.\n\nIn September 2009, Khan challenged the temporary suspension of the Mining License before the Administrative Court. However, the case was settled \"pursuant to an agreement reached between CAUC and the MRAM, in connection with the negotiation of the 2010 Memorandum of Understanding,\" subsequently entered into by Khan Canada and MonAtom on 22 January 2010 (\"**2010 MOU**\").43\n\nCounter-memorial, para.135, referring to Exhibit C-86; see also Exhibit C-4.\n\n48.\n\nOn 8 October 2009, the Mongolian Nuclear Energy Agency (\"**NEA**\") issued Decree No. 141, suspending the Mining and Exploration Licenses.44 The NEA had been created a few months earlier under the Nuclear Energy Law of Mongolia (\"**NEL**\"), which came into effect on 15 August 2009.45\n\nMemorial, para. 26.\n\nMemorial, para. 26.\n\n49.\n\nThe NEL was enacted for the purpose of \"regulating exploitation of radioactive minerals and nuclear energy in the territory of Mongolia for peaceful purposes, ensuring nuclear and radioactive safety and protecting population, society, and the environment from adverse effects of ionizing radiation.\"46 According to the NEL, Mongolia was to take ownership, without compensation, of \"no less that 51 percent of stake in the joint company, where exploration and determination of [uranium] reserve have been conducted with state budget.\"47\n\nMemorial, para. 26, quoting Exhibit R-11.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 136, 139, referring to Exhbit RL-11, Arts. 5.2, 5.3.\n\n50.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, Decree No. 141 suspended 149 uranium exploration and exploitation licenses, pending confirmation from the NEA of their re-registration under the NEL.48\n\nMemorial, para. 26; Hearing Transcript 22:20-24.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Mining and Exploration Licenses should have been re-issued pursuant to the 2010 MOU. The 2010 MOU also provided that MonAtom would henceforth own 51 percent of CAUC in compliance with the NEL.49\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 138.\n\n52.\n\nOn 15 March 2010, a governmental \"Inspection Group\" issued a report setting forth alleged violations of Mongolian law concerning the Mining and Exploration Licenses. On 9 April 2010, the NEA issued notices to both CAUC and Khan Mongolia, stating that their respective Mining and Exploration Licenses were invalidated.\n\n53.\n\nOn 15 April 2010 and 23 April 2010 respectively, Khan Mongolia and CAUC each commenced proceedings against the NEA before the Administrative Court to challenge the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses.50\n\nMemorial, para. 27; Counter-memorial, para. 162.\n\n54.\n\nOn 19 July 2010, in the proceedings initiated by CAUC, the Administrative Court rendered a decision with regard to the Mining License, stating that its invalidation was \"clearly unlawful.\"51 This decision was confirmed on appeal by the Appellate Court of the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Mongolia on 13 October 2010.52\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 164, quoting Exhibit R-25.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 164.\n\n55.\n\nOn 2 August 2010, in the proceedings initiated by Khan Mongolia, the Administrative Court rendered a decision with regard to the Exploration License, stating that its invalidation was \"clearly invalid.\"53\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 163, quoting Exhibit C-13/R-26.\n\n56.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the Administrative Court found that certain \"formal administrative\" procedures had not been correctly followed but \"did not cast any doubt upon the suspension of the Mining and Exploration Licenses pending re-registration in accordance with the NEL.\"54\n\nMemorial, para. 28; Reply, paras. 52-55.\n\n57.\n\nIn the Respondents' view, since the challenges by CAUC and Khan Mongolia before the Administrative Court did not extend to the substance of the allegations of regulatory breaches made against them, the Claimants \"were found to have been in violation of numerous different provisions of the regulations.\"55 Moreover, the decisions of the Administrative Court confirm that Mongolia did not act discriminatorily, as CAUC and Khan Mongolia were only two among many license holders whose licenses were suspended.56\n\nReply, paras. 46-48.\n\nReply, para. 51.\n\n58.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Mining and Exploration Licenses were not re-issued after the purported April 2010 invalidation. The Respondents explain that Mongolia could not re-issue the licenses because of the outstanding alleged breaches of Mongolian regulations by CAUC and Khan Mongolia.57\n\nMemorial, para. 27.\n\n59.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the purpose of the inspections, license suspensions, and license revocations carried out in 2009 and 2010 against Khan was to expel Khan from the CAUC joint venture in order to allow for a strictly Mongolian-Russian joint venture to develop Mongolia's uranium projects in the Dornod region.58\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 130.\n\n60.\n\nIn this respect, the Claimants allege that after Mr. Kiryenko, General Director of RosAtom, the Russian state nuclear agency, and ultimate owner of Priargunsky, visited the Dornod site in May 2008, the press reported in January 2009 on an announcement by Mr. Kyrienko and then Mongolian Prime Minister Mr. S. Bayer of plans to create a new Mongolian-Russian joint venture.59\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 125-127.\n\n61.\n\nFurthermore, during a visit by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to Mongolia in August 2009, the press reported that Russia and Mongolia had agreed that their joint venture would specifically \"focus on the Dornod deposit.\"60 According to the Claimants, Mongolia thus announced its intention to oust Khan from the Dornod Project.61\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 128, quoting Exhibit C-80.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 130; Hearing Transcript 94:25-95:6.\n\nD. EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE INVALIDATION OF THE MINING AND EXPLORATION LICENSES\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Parties provide divergent accounts of the events following the April 2010 invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses.\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants allege that they sought to resolve the dispute amicably, in particular through a letter sent on 15 April 2010, 6 days after the Mining and Exploration Licenses were invalidated, by Mr. Quick to the Mongolian Prime Minister Mr. Sukhbaatar Batbold (\"**Letter to the Prime Minister**\").62\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 150-151, referring to Exhibit C-15.\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimants also refer to trips made by Mr. Quick, Mr. Edey, who replaced Mr. Quick as President and CEO of Khan Canada as of 10 June 2010, and other representatives of Khan Canada to Mongolia to meet with Mr. Ragchaa Badamdamdin, the Chairman and CEO of MonAtom, and other Mongolian representatives in April, June, and October 2010.63\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 152-155.\n\n65.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, during these visits to Mongolia Mr. Badamdamdin repeatedly advised Khan Canada that the Director of the NEA, Mr. Sodnom Enkhbat, \"was resolutely opposed to Khan's participation in the Dornod Project, and was unlikely to engage in any settlement discussions.\"64\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 152-153.\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that during a meeting in October 2010 between Mr. Edey and representatives of the NEA, the SPC, and MonAtom, Mr. Enkhbat was \"extremely antagonistic toward Khan,\" convincing Mr. Edey of the futility of Khan's efforts to achieve amicable dispute resolution.65 The Claimants also note that Mr. Enkhbat made numerous vitriolic and public attacks against Khan in the press, supporting Khan's conclusion that amicable resolution of the dispute was not possible.66\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 155.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 156-161.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondents, in turn, state that the Claimants have not attempted to rectify their breaches of Mongolian law preventing the re-issuance of the Mining and Exploration Licenses.\n\n68.\n\nInstead, the Respondents argue, the Claimants tried to put pressure on them by commencing court proceedings in Ontario against Atomredmetzoloto JSC, the owner of Priargunsky, embarking on an \"aggressive publicity campaign against Mongolia, publishing correspondence directed at intimidating Mongolia,\" and commencing and rendering highly public these international arbitration proceedings.67\n\nMemorial, paras. 6, 30.\n\n**IV. LEGAL PROVISIONS RELEVANT TO THE DISPUTE**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nArticle 12 of the Founding Agreement provides, in relevant part:\n\nArbitration and Resolution of Disputes\n\n12.1 Governing Law\n\n(i) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with Mongolian laws; provided, that if any dispute between the parties is submitted to arbitration pursuant to paragraph 12.2 hereof and the arbitrators determine that there exists no provision of any Mongolian law applicable to the issues under dispute, such issue shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Australian law, without regard to conflicts of law principles.\n\n...\n\n12.2 Arbitration\n\nDisputes between the parties arising out of, or in connection with, any provisions of this agreement or the interpretation thereof shall be settled in the first instance by good faith negotiation. If amicable settlement cannot be reached within 90 days of the notice by the party claiming the existence of a dispute, the matter under dispute will be referred to binding arbitration in accordance with UNCITRAL arbitration rules.\n\n70.\n\nArticle 26 of the ECT provides, in relevant part:\n\nSettlement of Disputes Between an Investor and a Contracting Party\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).\n\n(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41.\n\n(c) A Contracting Party listed in Annex IA does not give such unconditional consent with respect to a dispute arising under the last sentence of Article 10(1).\n\n71.\n\nArticle 25 of the Foreign Investment Law provides:\n\nSettlement of Disputes\n\nDisputes between foreign investors and Mongolian investors as well as between foreign investors and Mongolian legal or natural persons on the matters relating to foreign investment and the operations of the foreign invested business entity shall be resolved in the Courts of Mongolia unless provided otherwise by international treaties to which Mongolia is a party or by any contract between the parties.\n\n**V. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n*The Respondents' position*\n---------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the Claimants, aware of the \"weak legal footing of their complaints,\" have conflated \"various different claims, claimant entities, and legal bases,\" bringing their claim under various legal instruments and multiplying claimant parties. According to the Respondents, \"when properly deconstructed,\" it becomes clear that the Claimants have no basis on which to bring any of their claims and accordingly the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear them.68\n\nMemorial, paras. 7-8; Reply, para. 135.\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n73.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondents' assertion that the Claimants fail to explain which claimant entities are bringing which claims is \"illogical\" and an \"attempt to create chaos where none exists,\" given that the Claimants have clearly stated in their Notice of Arbitration that Khan Canada and CAUC Holding are bringing claims under Article 12 of the Founding Agreement and that Khan Netherlands is bringing claims under Article 26 of the ECT, while all Claimants are invoking Article 25 of the Foreign Investment Law.69\n\nRejoinder, para. 42, referring to Notice of Arbitration, para. 13.\n\n**A. BURDEN OF PROOF**\n----------------------\n\n*The Respondents' position*\n---------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondents submit that all facts relevant to determining jurisdiction must be \"considered in full and proved at the jurisdiction[al] stage.\"70 The Respondents reject the Claimants' position that at the jurisdictional stage of the proceedings the Claimants' factual assertions must be taken *pro tem* by the Tribunal, once the Claimants have made a *prima facie* case.71\n\nHearing Transcript 27:11-14.\n\nMemorial, para. 12, n. 4; Reply, paras. 11-12.\n\n75.\n\nIn the Respondents' view, the Claimants misconstrue the *prima facie* test by failing to distinguish between facts that bear on jurisdiction and facts that bear on the merits. To apply the test correctly, as explained in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* (\"***Phoenix***\"), the Tribunal must \"look into the role... facts play either at the jurisdictional or at the merits level.... If the alleged facts are facts that, if proven, would constitute a violation of the relevant [treaty], they have indeed to be accepted as such at the jurisdictional stage, until their existence is ascertained or not at the merits level. On the contrary, *if jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage*.\"72\n\nReply, paras. 14-15, 26, quoting Exhibit CLA-51/RL-17, *Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award of 9 April 2009, paras. 60-61 [emphasis added by the Respondents].\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondents submit that because the purpose of the present proceeding is to \"definitively determine whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claims brought before it,\" both Parties must be given the opportunity to present their version of the facts related to jurisdictional issues, none of them being taken *pro tem*.73 The contrary would defeat the purpose of bifurcating the proceedings.74\n\nReply, paras. 13, 16, 25.\n\nReply, paras. 24-25.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondents dispute the Claimants' contention that the \"fundamental principles of justice, fairness, and equality between the parties\" require that the Claimants' version of the facts be accepted by the Tribunal, arguing instead that accepting the Claimants' version of the facts *pro tem* would impede the Respondents' right to be heard on the jurisdictional issues.75\n\nReply, paras. 17-18.\n\n78.\n\nFinally, according to the Respondents, none of the authorities cited in the Claimants' Countermemorial support their position. Thus, the reasoning in *Glamis Gold Ltd. v. United States* applies solely to decisions on requests for bifurcation, not to the consideration of issues of jurisdiction after bifurcation is granted, and the dissent of Judge Higgins in *Oil Platforms* *(Islamic Republic of Iran v. United Stated of America)* refers only to the facts related to the merits.76\n\nReply, paras. 21-23, referring to Counter-memorial, para. 171, Exhibit CLA-1, *Glamis Gold Ltd. v. United States*, Procedural Order No.2, 31 May 2005, para. 12(a), Exhibit CLA-52, *Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America)*, 12 December 1996, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, pp. 856-857; Hearing Transcript 26:9-25.\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondents argue that, contrary to the Claimants' assertion, they have advanced a version of the facts relevant to the determination on jurisdiction. According to the Respondents, if these facts also have a bearing on the merits of the case, this \"does not cause the fundamental and irremediable injustice that the Claimants contend.\"77\n\nReply, paras. 11, 19-20.\n\n80.\n\nFurther, the Respondents specify that the Claimants bear the burden of proving all the facts relevant to jurisdiction, as \"[t]here is no presumption of jurisdiction, particularly where a sovereign state is involved.\"78\n\nHearing Transcript 28:16-31:14.\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n81.\n\nIn their written submissions, the Claimants assert that they must make a *prima facie* case on jurisdiction, while the Respondents bear the burden of proving the facts on which their jurisdictional objections rely. To this effect, the Claimants rely on Article 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which provides that \"[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support its claim or defence,\" and the principle of *actori incumbit probatio*, \"long recognized as the fundamental rule governing the burden of proof before international courts and tribunals.\"79\n\nRejoinder, para. 13; see also Counter-memorial, para. 172; Rejoinder, paras. 14, 21. In their Countermemorial, the Claimants refer to Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, inadvertently referring to their 1976 version. This minor error does not affect the argument, as Article 24(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules and Article 27(1) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules have identical terms.\n\n82.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimants further explained that the party asserting the affirmative of a proposition bears the initial burden of proof, \"which then shifts to the party making the contrary view.\"80 In application of this principle, the Claimants bear the initial burden of proving that (i) Khan Canada is a party to the Founding Agreement; (ii) Mongolia is a party to the Founding Agreement; and (iii) the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over claims brought under the Founding Agreement. The Respondents must rebut these propositions. With respect to the claims brought under the ECT, the Claimants bear the initial burden of showing that the general jurisdictional requirements of the ECT have been met, while the Respondents bear the burden of proving the facts that underlie the \"exceptions or affirmative defences\" they invoke, such as the fork in the road and denial of benefits provisions of the ECT (Articles 26(3)(b)(i) and 17(1)).81\n\nHearing Transcript 102:3-16, 105:10-17.\n\nHearing Transcript 102:17-105:9, 166:9-167:15; 171:8-172:22; 185:23-186:20, referring to Exhibits CLA-64/RL-22, *Amto LLC v. Ukraine***,** SCC Case No. 080/2005, Final Award of 26 March 2008 (\"*Amto*\"), CLA-112, *Generation Ukraine, Inc v Ukraine*, Award, ICSID Case No ARB/00/9; IIC 116 (2003), (2005) 44 ILM 404, 15 September 2003.\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that once they have made a *prima facie* case, their factual assertions regarding merits must be taken as true *pro tem* at the jurisdictional phase *.* This is required by fundamental principles of justice, fairness, and equality between the parties.\n\n84.\n\nIf the Claimants were required to prove disputed facts by a preponderance of evidence at the jurisdictional phase, they would effectively be deprived of their right to a full hearing on the merits, as the Tribunal could decide on these facts before such a hearing. Accordingly, the Tribunal should only examine whether the facts alleged, if ultimately proven, are capable of falling within the scope of the instrument from which the Tribunal derives its jurisdiction.82\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 169-171.\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondents' contention that the Claimants wish all facts, including jurisdictional facts, to be accepted by the Tribunal *pro tem*. The Claimants accept the \"uncontroversial proposition that, unlike facts concerning the merits, purely jurisdictional facts must be proven at the jurisdictional phase.\"83\n\nRejoinder, paras. 8-11.\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimants note that any facts relating to the merits, including those that are also relevant to jurisdiction, \"must be fully and finally determined only at the merits stage.\"84\n\nRejoinder, paras. 19-20.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimants submit that they have \"firmly established their affirmative case on jurisdiction through reference to documentary evidence, witness and expert testimony, and credible legal theories,\" while the Respondents, to the extent that they have made allegations that are \"exclusively (or even primarily) relevant to jurisdiction,\" have provided \"almost no evidence whatsoever in support of those allegations.\"85\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 168-169; Rejoinder, paras. 15-17, 21, 23, 54; Hearing Transcript 103:2-6, 13-17, 21-22, 105:4-9, 105:24-106:7; see also Rejoinder, Appendix A: Claimants' unrebutted facts, and Appendix B: Respondents' unsubstantiated allegations.\n\n88.\n\nIn particular, the Respondents have submitted no evidence or counter-evidence showing that: (i) it was not the intention of the signatory parties to the Founding Agreement that Khan Canada should be a party to this agreement; (ii) MonAtom and its predecessors were not the Government's representatives in CAUC; (iii) MonAtom is not directly controlled by Mongolia; (iv) the Tribunal has no *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over claims brought under the Founding Agreement; (v) Khan Netherlands has violated Mongolian law; (vi) Khan Netherlands' representatives did not repeatedly request amicable settlement of this dispute; (vii) Mongolia was willing to settle the dispute with Khan Netherlands; (viii) any of the triggers of Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the ECT are implicated in this case; or (ix) the accepted requirements of Article 17(1) of the ECT are met in this case.86\n\nRejoinder, para. 17, Table 3.\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimants add that the Respondents' recitation of facts is mostly irrelevant to the issue of jurisdiction. For instance, Mongolia's purported invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses and the quantification of the amounts invested by the Claimants into the Dornod Project concern the merits, and not jurisdiction.87\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 2, 168-169; Rejoinder, paras. 7, 18.\n\nB. THE TRIBUNAL'S JURISDICTION OVER KHAN CANADA'S AND CAUC HOLDING'S CLAIMS UNDER THE FOUNDING AGREEMENT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction** ***ratione personae*** **over Khan Canada**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondents' position*\n---------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Respondents acknowledge that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over claims brought by CAUC Holding against MonAtom under the Founding Agreement, because CAUC Holding and MonAtom are parties to the Founding Agreement, by virtue of being successors, respectively, to WM Mining and Erdene, the original signatories of the Agreement.88\n\nMemorial, paras. 27, 42, 44; Counter-memorial, para. 238; Reply, para. 56.\n\n91.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondents submit that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione personae* over claims brought by Khan Canada under the Founding Agreement because Khan Canada is a party neither to the Founding Agreement nor to the arbitration agreement contained therein.89\n\nMemorial, para. 44; Reply, para. 59. Citing the same reasons, the Respondents also submit that the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction over Khan Netherlands under the Founding Agreement (Memorial, para. 44). However, the Claimants do not assert that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Khan Netherlands under the Founding Agreement (see Counter-memorial, paras. 163-192).\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondents specify that Khan Canada did not sign the Founding Agreement or any of its four amendments, and that the Founding Agreement was not assigned to Khan Canada.90\n\nMemorial, paras. 43-45.\n\n93.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the question of whether Khan Canada is a party to the Founding Agreement and to the arbitration agreement contained therein should be resolved on the basis of Mongolian law. Pursuant to Article 12.1(i) of the Founding Agreement, Mongolian law is the governing law of the contract. The Respondents assert that, where an applicable law is chosen by the parties to a contract, there is a strong presumption that the law applicable to the arbitration clause is the law governing the substantive agreement.91\n\nHearing Transcript, 32:9-34:6.\n\n94.\n\nIn the Respondents' view, the Claimants mistakenly invoke *Dow Chemical France, The Dow Chemical Co. and others v. ISOVER Saint Gobain* (\"***Dow Chemical***\") and the so-called \"group of companies doctrine,\" as Mongolian law recognizes neither this case nor this doctrine.92\n\nReply, paras. 61-65, referring to Exhibit CLA-40, *Dow Chemical France, The Dow Chemical Co. and others v. ISOVER Saint Gobain*, ICC Case No. 4131, Interim Award of 23 September 1982 (\"*Dow Chemical*\") *.*\n\n95.\n\nIn any event, the \"group of companies doctrine\" is \"merely a shortcut to avoid legal reasoning.\"93 In fact, the analysis in *Dow Chemical* and subsequent French case law rests on consent - the \"common intention of all the parties to the proceedings *(i.e.* the signatory and non-signatory parties) that the non-signatories be bound to the arbitration agreement.\"94\n\nHearing Transcript 36:7-19, quoting Exhibit RL-39.\n\nReply, para. 65; Hearing Transcript 34:11-37:7, referring to Exhibit RL-39.\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondents argue that in the present case, the proper parties to the Founding Agreement did not form a common intention that Khan Canada, a non-signatory, be a party to the arbitration agreement of the Founding Agreement. According to the Respondents, the excerpts from various documents invoked by the Claimants as evidence of such common intention are in fact only \"acknowledgements... of the indirect shareholding of CAUC by Khan Canada.\"95\n\nReply, paras. 68-70.\n\n97.\n\nMoreover, in order to extend an arbitration agreement to a non-signatory party, this party must at least have played a role in the contract's creation and performance. Yet Khan Canada, incorporated in 2002, did not even exist when the Founding Agreement was signed in 1995.96\n\nMemorial, para. 45; Reply, paras. 66-67.\n\n98.\n\nIn addition, the fact that the 2010 MOU contemplated Khan Canada and MonAtom concluding a \"formal joint venture agreement to govern the development, construction and exploration of the Dornod Project\" shows that Khan Canada was not at the time a party to any such joint venture.97\n\nHearing Transcript 39:17-41:22, quoting Exhibit C-4.\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n99.\n\nWith regard to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Khan Canada, the Claimants submit that \"entities that are not signatories to a contract that contains the relevant arbitration agreement may nevertheless be parties to that agreement.\"98\n\nCounter-memorial, para.178.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the question of whether Khan Canada, a non-signatory of the Founding Agreement, is nonetheless a party to the arbitration agreement contained therein is an inquiry \"more factual than legal\" and may be decided on the basis of the facts of the case, rather than on the basis of applicable law.99\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 178, quoting Exhibit CLA-38; Hearing Transcript 109:1-12.\n\n101.\n\nNevertheless, the Claimants assert that French law, and not Mongolian law as claimed by the Respondents, governs the arbitration agreement and therefore the analysis of the Parties' consent to arbitration. According to the Claimants, Article 12.1(i) of the Founding Agreement, invoked by the Respondents, identifies Mongolian law as applicable to the substantive provisions of the contract, but not to the arbitration agreement.100 The Claimants argue that pursuant to Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, an arbitration clause is \"an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract\" and can be governed by a law other than that governing the other terms of the contract. In the present case, as the law applicable to the arbitration agreement is not identified in the Founding Agreement, the arbitration agreement is governed by the law of the seat of arbitration, *i.e.* Paris, France. Accordingly, French law applies to the question of whether Khan Canada is a party to the Founding Agreement.101\n\nRejoinder, paras. 63-66; Hearing Transcript 121:8-18.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 63-66; Hearing Transcript 121:18-122:8.\n\n102.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants submit that, whether or not deciding only on the basis of the facts or on the basis of French law as the applicable law, the Tribunal must evaluate the common intention of the parties to the Founding Agreement, based on the conduct of the parties throughout the life of the contract and \"all relevant facts and circumstances of the case.\"102 The Claimants refer to what they consider to be the test laid down in *Dow Chemical* and approved by subsequent tribunals and commentators: \"whether factual circumstances exist that demonstrate that the non-signatory party is a \u2018real party' to the contract and/or arbitration agreement, by virtue of its role in the performance or termination of the contract(s) containing the arbitration clause.\"103 The Claimants add that the key inquiry is whether \"related companies involved in a transaction or contract form \u2018a single economic reality' (*une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique unique*).\"104\n\nCounter-memorial, paras.178-179; Rejoinder, paras. 69, 72; Hearing Transcript 122:9-14.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 181, 183.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 180, quoting Exhibit CLA-40, *Dow Chemical,* p.6.\n\n103.\n\nAlternatively, the Claimants argue that if Mongolian law is applicable, Khan Canada is nevertheless a party to the Founding Agreement, given that Mongolian law, and in particular Article 43.3 of the Civil Code of Mongolia(\"**Civil Code**\"), provides for implied consent to contract through conduct.105\n\nRejoinder, paras. 73-76; Hearing Transcript 123:24-124:8, 129:1-10.\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, in the present case, Khan Canada was \"a real party in interest\" with \"primary responsibility for coordinating and financing the entire Dornod Project.\"106 In fact, without Khan Canada, the Dornod Project would not have been possible, as Mongolia and MonAtom were well aware.107 In particular, the Respondents \"fully understood, accepted, and agreed\" that CAUC Holding, the successor to WM Mining under the Founding Agreement, was ultimately wholly owned and controlled by Khan Canada. The Respondents also \"fully understood, accepted, and agreed\" that all of the Claimants' contributions to the Dornod Project - financial, technical, or otherwise - came from Khan Canada.108 Thus, the minutes of a CAUC management committee meeting held on 26 August 2009 evidence MonAtom's recognition that Khan Canada had completed and even exceeded its commitments \"as per the original Founding Agreement.\"109 Similarly, the minutes of the CAUC management committee meeting of 9 November 2009 recognize the expected benefits of Khan Resources' planned contribution of the Exploration License to the joint venture.110\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 192; Rejoinder, paras. 60, 81.\n\nHearing Transcript 122:22-123:4.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 184-185; Rejoinder, paras. 60, 77.\n\nHearing Transcript 145:5-22, referring to Exhibit C-38, Item 6.\n\nHearing Transcript 146:23-150:7, referring to Exhibit C-39.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimants note that numerous other documents, such as CAUC's shareholder resolutions,111 a resolution of the SPC,112 licenses to CAUC issued by the SSIA,113 a Mongolian parliamentary report,114 the 2010 MOU,115 a memorandum of understanding entered into by the SPC and Khan Canada in 2005, and letters by the SSIA and the NEA116 recognize that Khan Canada was \"the party to be dealt with on matters concerning CAUC.\"117 Among other, the Claimants highlight that (i) representatives of Khan Canada participated in CAUC shareholders' meetings in the capacities of \"Chairman\" and \"voting member;\"118 (ii) the SPC and MonAtom negotiated memorandums of understanding with Khan Canada in 2005 and 2010 to address the future ownership and operation of CAUC;119 and (iii) the Mongolian governmental agencies repeatedly identified Khan Canada as the Canadian partner in the Mongolia-Russia-Canada joint venture (CAUC).120\n\nExhibit C-11.\n\nExhibit C-49.\n\nExhibits C-67, C-68.\n\nExhibit C-71.\n\nExhibit C-4.\n\nExhibit C-70/R-8.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 185-186; Rejoinder, paras. 79-80.\n\nRejoinder, para. 80, referring to Exhibits C-38, C-39.\n\nRejoinder, para. 80, referring to Exhibits C-4, C-66.\n\nRejoinder, para. 80, referring to Exhibit C-71, Appendix B, s.

The Claimants point out that, similarly, in the present case, Mongolia referred to the conduct of the parent company, Khan Canada, to justify the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses held by the subsidiaries, CAUC Holding and Khan Mongolia.124\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 190; Rejoinder, para. 80; Hearing Transcript 157:19-158:1, referring to Exhibits C-13, C-14.\n\n110.\n\nMoreover, when CAUC Holding's and Khan Mongolia's respective Mining and Exploration Licenses were invalidated, it was Khan Canada's representatives that attempted to resolve amicably the dispute with MonAtom and the NEA.125\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 191; Rejoinder, para. 80, referring to the Edey Statement, paras. 34-41.\n\n111.\n\nThe Claimants argue further that, contrary to the Respondents' assertion, there is no requirement for a non-signatory to have played a role in the creation of the contract to be a party thereto. It is therefore irrelevant that Khan Canada did not exist when the Founding Agreement was concluded.126\n\nRejoinder, paras. 68-72.\n\n112.\n\nFinally, the Claimants state that the above facts demonstrate that the parties to the joint venture understood and accepted that Khan Canada was a party to the Founding Agreement and the arbitration agreement therein. The Claimants emphasize that the Respondents provide no evidence to the contrary, merely insisting on the fact that Khan Canada did not sign the Founding Agreement.127\n\nRejoinder, paras. 78, 80; Hearing Transcript 111:20-112:11.\n\n**2. Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction** ***ratione personae*** **over Mongolia**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondents' position*\n---------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione personae* over claims brought against Mongolia under the Founding Agreement, given that MonAtom is the only respondent entity that is a successor to a signatory of the Founding Agreement (Erdene) and that MonAtom and Mongolia are separate entities.128 The Respondents explain that MonAtom, while a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mongolia, is a \"business entity with a separate legal personality... carrying out standard corporate business.\"129 An arbitration agreement signed by an independent state-owned entity does not bind the state.130\n\nMemorial, paras. 48, 53.\n\nMemorial, paras. 49, 54; Reply, para. 94.\n\nHearing Transcript 42:19-21.\n\n114.\n\nThe Respondents submit that MonAtom's registered corporate articles and the Company Law of Mongolia of 1999 (\"**Company Law**\") affirm MonAtom's independent character.131 Thus, the Company Law states at Article 9.3 that \"shareholders shall not be liable for the obligations of the company.\"132 MonAtom's charter provides that \"[t]he company is 100 percent a state-owned limited liability company and shall be a profit seeking legal entity with independent balance sheet, shall be empowered to enjoy rights and obligations on its own behalf, and shall have its own distinct assets,\" without any statement that MonAtom carries out its obligations or engages in activities on behalf of Mongolia.133 MonAtom's charter further shows that MonAtom is \"constrained to act as an ordinary independent business, from the nature of the decisions taken at Shareholders' Meetings, to the actions implemented by the Board of Directors.\"134\n\nReply, paras. 93, 96, referring to Exhibit R-23.\n\nMemorial, paras. 49-51, quoting Exhibit R-23; Reply, para. 97.\n\nMemorial, para. 51, quoting Exhibit R-22, Art. 2.1; Reply, para. 98.\n\nMemorial, para. 54.\n\n115.\n\nThe Respondents also contend that MonAtom's conduct supports the notion that it operates independently from the Government. For instance, the fact that the NEA, a state agency, purported to invalidate the 2010 MOU entered into by MonAtom and Khan Canada shows that MonAtom does not act in tandem with the Government, as otherwise MonAtom would not have signed the 2010 MOU in the first place.135 Moreover, the fact that the Claimants wished to negotiate an investment agreement with Mongolia, as stated in the 2010 MOU, shows that they did not consider that Mongolia was a party to the Founding Agreement.136\n\nMemorial, paras. 55-56, referring to Exhibit C-4; Reply, para. 103.\n\nHearing Transcript 47:5-48:25, referring to Exhibit C-4.\n\n116.\n\nAdditionally, contrary to the Claimants' assertion, the fact that MonAtom is ultimately held by the state does not suggest that MonAtom entered into the Founding Agreement as an authorised representative of Mongolia.137 Article 3.7 of the Founding Agreement draws a clear distinction between Mongolia and the parties to the joint venture by separately establishing their respective liabilities.138\n\nReply, para. 101.\n\nHearing Transcript 44:10-45:8.\n\n117.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants cannot rely on the Minerals Agreement to establish that MonAtom is an instrument of Mongolia.139 The Minerals Agreement is \"entirely irrelevant\" to the present dispute, given that no claims have been brought under it.140\n\nMemorial, para. 57.\n\nMemorial, para. 58.\n\n118.\n\nIn any event, the Minerals Agreement clearly indicates that MonAtom and Mongolia are separate entities. For instance, Article 18.1 of the Minerals Agreement states that it is \"contingent on approval by the Government of Mongolia,\" thus showing that Erdene, the Mongolian signatory of and MonAtom's predecessor under the agreement, is not a representative of the Government.141\n\nMemorial, paras. 60-61.\n\n119.\n\nFurther, as established by case law, the signature of an \"authorized representative of the Mongolian Ministry of Energy, Geology and Mining\" on the last page of the Minerals Agreement does not mean that Mongolia is a party to this agreement.142\n\nMemorial, paras. 62-63, referring to Exhibit RL-14, *S.P.P. (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICC Award No. 3493, 16 Feb. 1983, *R\u00e9publique Arabe d'Egypte v. Southern Pacific Properties Ltd*., Paris Court of Appeal, 12 July 1984, Note. B. Goldman, Journal du Droit International, 1985, 130, and quoting Exhibit C-10, Art. 18(1); Hearing Transcript 45:14-46:24. The Respondents add that even if Mongolia were a party to the Minerals Agreement and had agreed to arbitration thereunder, Article 16.3 of the Minerals Agreement would apply. This provision allows MonAtom to bring another entity into the joint venture to replace CAUC Holding in the event CAUC Holding breaches the Minerals Agreement (Memorial, paras. 164-166).\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondents reject the Claimants' argument that the Minerals Agreement and the Charter should be construed as evidencing Mongolia's role in CAUC, because the cited provisions only serve to recognize that the Government would \"necessarily feature in the regulation and oversight of the project.\"143 For this reason, the Parties \"expressly separated Mongolia from incurring liability by way of the Founding Agreement's Article 3.7, and by contracting with a private limited liability company in the form of Erdene, and now MonAtom.\"144\n\nReply, paras. 89-90.\n\nReply, para. 91.\n\n121.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, by invoking the Law on State and Local Government Property (\"**LSLP**\"), the Claimants are inviting the Tribunal to ignore the legal status of MonAtom under the Company Law and MonAtom's own charter in favour of the legal framework governing state property in Mongolia. However, in the Respondents' view, there is no reason why any of the provisions of the LSLP would alter MonAtom's legal character as \"an independent limited liability Mongolian company.\"145\n\nReply, paras. 95, 100.\n\n122.\n\nAddressing the Claimants' argument that if MonAtom is not a representative of Mongolia, the 2009 transfer of shares in CAUC from the SPC to MonAtom would be void due to failure to comply with the requirements for transfer to a third party found at Article 11 of the Founding Agreement, the Respondents state that this provision applies only to transfers \"for a price,\" and not situations where one entity (MonAtom) succeeds to another (the SPC). Indeed, Article 11(1) of the Founding Agreement refers to the \"price and terms upon which the Disposing Member proposes to sell.\" In any event, the Claimants recognize that they were notified by a letter dated 4 June 2009 of the transfer of shares from the SPC to MonAtom.146\n\nReply, paras. 105-107.\n\n123.\n\nFinally, the Respondents submit that the International Law Commission Draft Articles on State Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, while widely accepted as reflecting customary international law, are not applicable to the present dispute.147\n\nMemorial, paras. 67-79.\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimants submit that MonAtom is not independent of Mongolia, as the Respondents claim. Rather, as confirmed by the Tsogt Report, MonAtom is Mongolia's representative in the Founding Agreement.148\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 193-194; Rejoinder, para. 83; Hearing Transcript 119:24-120:9.\n\n125.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants assert that: (i) MonAtom is Mongolia's representative in the specific context of the Founding Agreement; (ii) MonAtom, as an entity charged with holding state property, acts at the behest of Mongolia pursuant to the LSLP; and (iii) if MonAtom were indeed independent from Mongolia, the 2009 transfer of CAUC shares from the SPC to MonAtom would be invalid.149\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 196.\n\n*(i) MonAtom is Mongolia's representative in the specific context of the Founding Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimants submit that MonAtom and its predecessors in the Founding Agreement (Erdene, the MRAM, and the SPC) have always acted and have always viewed themselves as acting on behalf of Mongolia. Thus, as apparent from numerous provisions of the Founding Agreement and related contracts, \"Mongolia is the \u2018Mongolian party' to the Founding Agreement.\"150\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 41, 197, 206, referring to the Tsogt Report.\n\n127.\n\nFor instance, Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement provides that the property of the company \"will not be subject to requisition or confiscation.\" As confirmed by the Tsogt Report and Black's Law Dictionary, \"requisition\" and \"confiscation\" are terms that apply uniquely to the governmental actions.151 Article 15.1 of the Founding Agreement also provides that all notices are to be made \"c/o Ministry of Energy, Geology and Natural Resources of Mongolia.\"152\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 52, referring to the Tsogt Report, paras. 25-27, 57-59, Exhibit CLA-27.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 53.\n\n128.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that while they do not assert any claims under the Minerals Agreement and the Charter, these documents are nevertheless relevant to the interpretation of the Founding Agreement, insofar as they provide context for understanding Mongolia's role in the joint venture.153\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 44-46, 198.\n\n129.\n\nSpecifically, the Minerals Agreement includes the undertaking by the \"Mongolian Party\" to provide the joint venture with the \"right to utilize mineral deposits,\" as well as an assumption of obligations regarding \"questions of licensing, taxation, customs, royalties, and environmental liabilities\" that could only have been assumed by a sovereign, - *i.e*. Mongolia.154 The Minerals Agreement also refers to Erdene's acts \"on behalf of the Ministry of Energy, Geology and Mining Industry of Mongolia.\"155\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 48-50, 197, n. 271, referring to Exhibit C-17A, Minerals Agreement, Arts.1.1, 2.2, 4.3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 12.2, 13.1.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 50, referring to Exhibit C-17A, Minerals Agreement, Art.13.1.\n\n130.\n\nAs for the Charter, it explains that the contribution of Erdene will be based on the reduction of fees to be paid by CAUC for use of natural resources and may consist of \"rights for the use of land, water, and other natural resources.\"156 Such contributions also could only be made by Mongolia.157\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 51.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 51, quoting Exhibit C-18A, Charter, Art. 4.3.\n\n131.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants assert that from 1995 to 2001, while Erdene held the CAUC shares, the Government used Erdene and other governmental agencies interchangeably as its representatives in CAUC. For instance, government officials signed official CAUC documents on behalf of Erdene.158\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 41, 57-60, 201, referring to Exhibit C-16E.\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimants further assert that, in 2001, the \"Mongolian Party\" shares in CAUC were transferred to the MRAM, a government regulatory agency. The other shareholders of CAUC accepted this transfer as merely a change in the designation of the government entity responsible for Mongolia's shares, and not as a formal sale of shares that would have needed to comply with the restrictions on transfer provided under Article 11 of the Founding Agreement.159\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 63-66.\n\n133.\n\nThus, when Khan first invested in CAUC in 2003, the MRAM was the \"Mongolian Party\" to the Founding Agreement, and, as confirmed by the Edey Statement, Khan understood that the Government was its partner in CAUC.160\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 202, referring to the Edey Statement, para. 27; Rejoinder, para. 85.\n\n134.\n\nAfter Mongolia transferred the authority to represent it in CAUC from the MRAM to the SPC in 2005, the SPC attempted to sell its shares in the joint venture to Khan Canada. The offer to sell, as well as other correspondence exchanged by Khan Canada and the SPC, refer to the SPC's shares as \"state-owned\" and confirm that the SPC acted on behalf of Mongolia.161 A CAUC shareholders' resolution passed on 31 October 2005 \"to clarify the status of respective interests in CAUC,\" lists the shareholders of CAUC as: \"Mongolia (the State) (through the SPC),\" Priargunsky, and CAUC Holding Company Ltd. The SPC's signature of this resolution demonstrates that it understood its role as proxy for Mongolia.162\n\nHearing Transcript 134:4-137:3, referring to Exhibits C-49, C-66.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 70-71, 203-204, quoting Exhibit C-11 and referring to the Edey Statement.\n\n135.\n\nIn 2006, the prospectus for the initial public offering of shares in Khan Canada on the Toronto Stock Exchange confirmed Khan Canada's belief that Mongolia was the owner of 21 percent of the shares in CAUC.163\n\nHearing Transcript 141:6-142:19, referring to Exhibit C-24.\n\n136.\n\nIn 2009, when the SPC's shares were transferred to MonAtom, the shareholders were notified that the \"state shares held in CAUC... that allow [...] to implement the right to represent the state ha[ve] been transferred,...\"164 Finally, shortly after the NEL came into effect, providing that Mongolia's share in all Mongolian entities which had been granted a license to explore or exploit uranium in Mongolia was to reach 51 percent, MonAtom declared its status as the future owner of Mongolia's increased 51 percent interest in CAUC at the management board meeting held on 4 November 2009.165\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 205; Rejoinder, para. 95, referring to the Tsogt Report, paras. 29-45; Exhibits C-37, C-38.\n\nExhibit C-39, Item 5; see also Exhibits C-89, C-90.\n\n137.\n\nIn this connection, the Claimants argue that if MonAtom had been acting independently from Mongolia, it would have transferred its shares back to a government agency such as the SPC.166\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 207-211.\n\n138.\n\nThe Claimants also note that Mongolian law recognizes \"that civil transactions may be concluded through a representative on the basis of an authorization\" and that Mongolia, as the principal, is responsible for MonAtom's obligations under the Founding Agreement.167\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 212-213, referring to Exhibit CLA-43, Civil Code, Art. 62(6.1,6.3); Rejoinder, para. 96.\n\n139.\n\nWith regard to the Respondents' submissions on this issue, the Claimants emphasize that the Respondents have failed to respond to the relevant parts of the Edey Statement and the Tsogt Report and to provide evidence to counter the facts that: (i) successive Mongolian representatives to CAUC consistently held themselves out as representing the Government; (ii) government agencies have directly participated as shareholders in CAUC; (iii) CAUC understood Mongolia to be a shareholder in the joint venture; and (iv) Mongolia understood that it was a shareholder of CAUC.168\n\nRejoinder, paras. 25, 84-88.\n\n140.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants submit that the Respondents incorrectly rely on Article 3.7 of the Founding Agreement in support of their contention that \"liability would not attach to Mongolia.\"169 In fact, as confirmed by the Tsogt Report, Article 3.7 only stands for the proposition that Mongolia cannot be liable for the obligations of CAUC. Article 3.7 does not limit Mongolia's liability for breaching the Founding Agreement vis-\u00e0-vis other parties to the Agreement. The Claimants argue further that the mention of Mongolia's liability in the Founding Agreement demonstrates that Mongolia was a party to the agreement.170\n\nRejoinder, paras. 90-91, quoting Reply, para. 78.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 91-92, referring to Tsogt Report, para. 28.\n\n*(ii) MonAtom is controlled by Mongolia pursuant to the LSLP*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimants submit further that, contrary to the Respondents' contention, the fact that MonAtom is a limited liability company does not contradict its role as representative of Mongolia.171 Nevertheless, the Claimants \"feel compelled to correct the Respondents' mischaracterizations as to the general status of MonAtom under Mongolian law.\"172 Thus, while corporate entities may be independent of their shareholders under \"general Mongolian company law,\" the Respondents overlook the \"larger framework governing state entities... charged with holding state property and executing state policies.\"173\n\nRejoinder, paras. 93-98.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 214.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 195.\n\n142.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, MonAtom carries out governmental activities and is firmly under the control and direction of the Government.174 Under Articles 3(1), 5(1), and 5(3) of the LSLP, shares held by state-owned enterprises, such as MonAtom's 21 percent shareholding in CAUC, are state property.175 The LSLP grants the SPC, a state agency, the powers to \"own, use, [and] dispose\" of state property, to \"appoint state property representatives to legal persons with state property\", and to \"supervise the[...] activity\" of such legal persons.176 Accordingly, and as sole shareholder of MonAtom, the SPC has complete power to appoint and dismiss members of MonAtom's board of directors, as well as to dismiss MonAtom's executive director.177\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 216.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 218-219, referring to Exhibit CLA-44, LSLP.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 218, 220, quoting Exhibit CLA-44, LSLP, Arts. 10(1), 11(1)(6).\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 220-222, referring to Exhibit R-22, MonAtom's charter, Art.8.1.\n\n143.\n\nMoreover, the LSLP provides that a \"legal person with state property\" such as MonAtom is established by the state \"with the purpose of implementing its policy and maintaining social consumption,\" thus further confirming MonAtom's governmental purpose.178\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 223-224, quoting Exhibit CLA-44, LSLP, Art.13.\n\n*(iii) The 2009 transfer of shares in CAUC from the SPC to MonAtom*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimants submit that if MonAtom were acting independently of Mongolia, the 2009 transfer of CAUC shares from the SPC to MonAtom would be void and of no effect. The Founding Agreement and Mongolian law both subject the transfer of shares in CAUC to any third party entity to strict formalities and rights of pre-emption for the other shareholders in CAUC.179 These formalities, including the compulsory written notice to the other shareholders of CAUC, were not respected.180 For instance, the letter dated 4 June 2009, referred to by the Respondents, does not constitute sufficient notice, as it fails to provide any details regarding the terms or price of the transaction and was not addressed to CAUC.181\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 225, referring to the Tsogt Report, paras. 41-54; Rejoinder, para. 101.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 226.\n\nRejoinder, para. 104, referring to Exhibit C-37; Hearing Transcript 160:22-161:8.\n\n145.\n\nIn fact, the Claimants argue that Khan accepted the transfer of CAUC shares from the SPC to MonAtom only because it was understood that MonAtom was representing Mongolia's interests.182\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 227-228, quoting the Edey Statement, para. 31.\n\n146.\n\nThe Claimants reject as implausible the Respondents' argument that the 2009 transaction whereby shares in CAUC passed from the SPC to MonAtom did not trigger the transfer of shares formalities merely because MonAtom \"succeeded\" the SPC as a shareholder in CAUC - *i.e.* received the shares for free. As these are the same shares that Mongolia offered to sell Khan Canada and Priargunsky for USD 30 million in 2005, it is unlikely the SPC would have been willing to transfer them for free to MonAtom had MonAtom been an independent third party.183\n\nRejoinder, paras. 101-102.\n\n147.\n\nFurthermore, in the Claimants' view, it is not a coincidence that this transfer of shares from a state agency to a \"nominally independent LLC\" occurred just after Mongolia and Russia agreed in principle to develop the Dornod Project together and to the exclusion of the Claimants. In fact, the transfer of shares from the SPC to MonAtom was a \"transaction.concluded by expressing intention based on serious misleading\" in the meaning of Article 58.1 of the Civil Code. The Claimants allege that such transactions are void.184 Therefore, if MonAtom is indeed independent from Mongolia, the transfer of shares from the SPC to MonAtom likewise is void.

Yet, the Claimants' claim of breach of fiduciary duty, as described in the Notice of Arbitration and the Tsogt Report, is made exclusively against Mongolia.188\n\nMemorial, paras. 107-110; Reply, paras. 114-118; Hearing Transcript 56:16-57:6, 57:18-24.\n\n150.\n\nFinally, the Respondents aver that the Claimants' desire to enter into the 2010 MOU with MonAtom and MonAtom's cooperative behaviour in this context confirm that the Claimants \"do not and cannot have any\" breach of fiduciary duty claims against MonAtom.189 Thus, the Claimants are attempting to \"use MonAtom as a mere vehicle to direct their claims against Mongolia, which is not a party to the Founding Agreement.\"190\n\nMemorial, para. 110; Reply, para. 118.\n\nReply, para. 119.\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, contrary to the Respondents' main objection to the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Tribunal, they have sufficiently identified relevant legal bases for their claims under the Founding Agreement in the Notice of Arbitration.191\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 234.\n\n152.\n\nIn particular, the breach of fiduciary duty claim is based on Articles 81 and 82 of the Company Law, which states that a \"governing person\" (*i.e.*, Mongolia) in a Mongolian company shall be personally liable to the company's shareholders if such a person intentionally violates the principle that requires it to \"act in good faith and in CAUC's interest.\"192 The breach of fiduciary duty claim is also founded on Articles 227.1 and 497.1 of the Civil Code.193\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 235, 238-39.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 240-41.\n\n153.\n\nAddressing whether \"the Claimants' Notice of Arbitration stated legally cognizable claims against the Respondents under the Founding Agreement,\" The Tsogt Report on Mongolian law states that if Mongolia illegally cancelled the Mining and Exploration Licenses in order to \"enter a new joint venture covering the same purpose as the CAUC joint venture,... then the Government has breached its basic obligation to implement the business described in the Founding Agreement.\"194 As the principal, Mongolia is responsible for the acts of its representatives Erdene, the MRAM, the SPC, and MonAtom.195\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 237, referring to the Tsogt Report, para. 61.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 242, referring to Exhibit CLA-43, Civil Code, Art. 63; Rejoinder, para. 108.\n\n154.\n\nMoreover, even if the Tribunal were to find that Mongolia is not a party to the Founding Agreement, MonAtom still has breached its fiduciary duties \"arising out of, or in connection with\" the Founding Agreement.196\n\nRejoinder, para. 109.\n\n155.\n\nIn particular, MonAtom will participate in the new Russia-Mongolia joint venture which \"improperly and illegally displaces\" Khan.197 In this respect, the Claimants clarify that where they referred to \"Mongolia\" in their submissions, they were referring to all the Respondents, including MonAtom.198\n\nRejoinder, para. 109.\n\nRejoinder, para. 107.\n\n156.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondents' argument that their fiduciary obligations under the Company Law are not sufficiently connected to the Founding Agreement \"lacks any legal support, defies logic and must be rejected.\"199 CAUC and its shareholders, including MonAtom, are governed by the Company Law. Thus, \"[t]here can be no more fundamental claim than one between joint venture partners for a failure to meet their fiduciary obligations to one another.\"200\n\nRejoinder, para. 111.\n\nRejoinder, para. 111.\n\n*(ii) Khan's expropriation claims*\n----------------------------------\n\n*The Respondents' position*\n---------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the Claimants have failed to establish a link between their expropriation claims and the provisions of the Founding Agreement.201\n\nMemorial, para. 63.\n\n158.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondents contend that the Claimants rely on the second sentence of Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement to argue that there is a connection between their unlawful expropriation claims under the Founding Agreement and the Foreign Investment Law.202 While the Claimants construe Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement as having an effect similar to that of an \"expropriation provision, \" the Respondents contend that the wording of the clause does not lend itself to such an interpretation.203\n\nReply, para. 122\n\nMemorial, para. 88.\n\n159.\n\nArticle 3.6 reads, in full:\n\n\"The Company will own, use, and dispose of its property in accordance with the laws of Mongolia and consistent with the goals of its activities and the purposes of such property. Property of the Company will not be subject to requisition or confiscation.\"\n\n160.\n\nIn the Respondents' view, this provision seeks to prevent CAUC's founders and their successors from using CAUC's property (raw materials, machinery, and other assets) for purposes other than those of the company, rather than to render Mongolia liable for state expropriation of CAUC's property.204\n\nMemorial, paras. 90-91; Reply, para. 129; Hearing Transcript 52:3-18, 53:11-14.\n\n161.\n\nIn fact, Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement lacks \"all of the essential elements\" present in expropriation clauses found in international investment treaties in general and in Mongolia's bilateral investment treaties in particular.205\n\nMemorial, paras. 93-96, 98-102; Reply, para. 128; Hearing Transcript 52:19-53:12.\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondents note in this respect that unlike Mongolia's bilateral investment treaties, the Founding Agreement was not signed by a top-level government official.206 The Respondents also note that the two lines of Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement are significantly less detailed than the expropriation clauses of, *inter alia*, the ECT, the seven bilateral investment treaties signed by Mongolia in 1995, the year the Founding Agreement was concluded, the recent investment agreement between Rio Tinto, Ivanhoe Mines, and Mongolia, and annex C of the 2010 MOU.207\n\nMemorial, paras. 103-04.\n\nMemorial, paras. 95-104, referring to Exhibit C-4; Hearing Transcript 53:15-54:11, referring to Exhibit C-118.\n\n163.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the entire purpose of the Founding Agreement significantly differs from an investment agreement's aim to provide foreign investors with guarantees such as protection from expropriation. As is apparent from Article 2 of the Founding Agreement, its purpose relates rather to the creation and management of a joint venture company intended to generate profits for its members through the sale of minerals.208\n\nMemorial, paras. 84-85; Reply, paras. 125-26.\n\n164.\n\nArticle 3.7 of the Founding Agreement further excludes any possible liability of Mongolia by stating that \"the Government of Mongolia shall not be liable for the obligations of the Company.\"209\n\nMemorial, para. 92.\n\n165.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the Claimants \"knew on no uncertain terms\" that a provision for the protection of investments did not exist under the Founding Agreement.210 That is why the Claimants were keen to enter into an investment agreement with Mongolia which would include such provisions, as was planned in the 2010 MOU.211\n\nMemorial, para. 97.\n\nMemorial, paras. 96-97; Reply, paras. 130-136.\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondents \"have created a lengthy argument based on the straw man that Article 3.6 is not an expropriation clause such as the ones found in the [Foreign Investment Law] or a BIT.\"212 In response, the Claimants state that they do not contend that Article 3.6 is \"precisely identical\" to an expropriation provision in an investment treaty.213 Rather, Article 3.6 is a more expansive expropriation provision, protecting the investor from confiscation of property, including mining licenses, in \"*any* circumstances.\"214 This wide scope makes \"particular sense\" in the context of a joint venture to which the Government is a party.215\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 243.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 244;

The Claimants, by quoting different translations of this provision, show their \"willingness to manipulate the wording of Article 10(1) to seek an effect that the clause cannot have.\"226\n\nReply, paras. 138-141; Hearing Transcript 58:13-59:2.\n\nReply, paras. 142-43; Hearing Transcript 57:24-58:2.\n\nHearing Transcript 58:2-16, 59:2-7.\n\nReply, paras. 144-49.\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n172.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over claims that Mongolia breached its obligations toward the Claimants under general principles of international law.227 The Claimants assert that, irrespective of whether \"the proper law of the Founding Agreement is local law,\" Mongolia's conduct in the exercise of its sovereign authority in relation to foreign investors is governed by minimum international legal standards, which include \"non-expropriation without compensation, non-arbitrariness and non-abuse of discretion.\"228 The fact that Mongolia undertook \"*sovereign* obligations\" under the Founding Agreement and the other constitutive CAUC documents suggests that the Founding Agreement \"is properly subject to international law.\"229 Moreover, according to the Claimants, all organs of international jurisdiction have the inherent power to refer to general principles of international law, unless this power is expressly excluded from their competence. The Claimants submit that the Tribunal is such an organ of international jurisdiction, given that the subject matter of the dispute is \"the treatment of foreign investors *qua* foreign investors.\"230 Further, a mere selection of national law does not suffice to exclude the application of international law.231\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 254.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 249-250; Rejoinder, para. 125.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 251 [emphasis in original].\n\nRejoinder, para. 125.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 120-125.\n\n173.\n\nThe Claimants argue further that, whether Article 10(1) of the Constitution is read as being mandatory with respect to adherence to international law (\"shall adhere\") or as a statement of recognition that Mongolian law adheres to international law (\"Mongolia adheres\"), and as confirmed by the Mongolian Supreme Court's resolution \"On the Application of International Treaties and Universally Recognized Norms and Principles of International Law in Judicial Court Practice,\" Mongolian law may not be interpreted or applied in a manner that falls below the international minimum standard with respect to treatment of foreign investors.232\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 252-253; Rejoinder, para. 117.\n\n174.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that, in any event, the Tribunal can find that it has jurisdiction over claims made under the Founding Agreement without having to determine whether Mongolia is liable under international law for actions carried out in connection with the Founding Agreement.233\n\nRejoinder, paras. 116, 119.\n\nC.

Whether Khan Netherlands is prevented from bringing ECT claims due to its failure to comply with Mongolian Law**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondents' position*\n---------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe Respondents submit that Khan Netherlands' violations of Mongolian law deprive it of the protection of the ECT, \"regardless of whether these [violations] occurred before or after the initial investment was made.\"235 While admitting that the ECT is silent on the \"necessary compliance of an investment with the laws of the host state,\" the Respondents cite the *Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria* award on the merits (\"***Plama*** **Award on the Merits**\") to argue that the ECT's substantive protections cannot apply to \"investments that are made contrary to law.\"236 The Respondents also refer to the rationale for this rule as expressed in *Phoenix* : \"[t]he purpose of international protection is to protect legal and bona fide investments.\"237\n\nMemorial, para. 124; Reply, para. 153.\n\nMemorial, paras. 125-128, quoting Exhibit C-50, *Plama Consortium Limited v.

Such a rule would incentivize host state regulators to impose pretextual sanctions on foreign investment enterprises as a means of avoiding arbitration under the ECT, running contrary to the ECT's goals of \"promot[ing] long-term cooperation\" and \"strengthening... the rule of law\" in the energy field.251\n\nRejoinder, para. 136.\n\n187.\n\nThe Claimants further note that the Respondents' premise is not supported by any of the principles of international law invoked in *Plama,* as these were all directed towards circumstances where \"the claims in question are based upon, arise from, or otherwise would not exist in the absence of the claimant's own illegal or non-bona fide acts.\"252\n\nRejoinder, paras. 137-138.\n\n188.\n\nFurther, the Claimants argue that, even if a violation of the host state's law during the course of an investment sufficed to preclude a foreign investor from bringing a claim under the ECT, the Respondents would bear the burden of proving the facts underlying their objection to jurisdiction.

Whether Khan Netherlands is prevented from bringing ECT claims by operation of Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondents' position*\n---------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the fork in the road clause at Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT precludes Khan Netherlands from making its claims under the Treaty, because the Claimants have already brought these claims before the Mongolian courts.272\n\nMemorial, para. 156.\n\n201.\n\nArticle 26(3) of the Treaty provides, in relevant part:\n\n(3)(a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n(b)(i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID **do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute** under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).\n\n(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41.273\n\nMemorial, para. 158, quoting the ECT [emphasis added by the Respondents].\n\n202.\n\nArticle 26(2)(a) refers to the resolution of disputes by \"the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute.\" According to the Respondents, as Mongolia was listed in Annex ID of the ECT when the Claimants filed the Notice of Arbitration, Mongolia had \"clearly\" not given \"its unconditional consent to arbitrate where the dispute has already been referred to its courts or administrative tribunals.\"274 Mongolia's intention to withhold such unconditional consent is further emphasized by its written statement of policies, practices, and conditions provided in accordance with Article 26(3)(b)(ii).275\n\nMemorial, paras. 159-160, 162.\n\nMemorial, para. 161; Hearing Transcript 64:4-65:11. The relevant part of the statement reads as follows: \"Disputes resolved by Courts of Mongolia cannot be resubmitted to the International Courts as national courts have already given a final judgment and will contradict the Constitution of Mongolia and has a risk of having two judgments on the same dispute. Therefore, policies, practices and conditions of Mongolia do not allow an investor to resubmit the same dispute in international arbitration\" (Memorial, para. 161, quoting Exhibit RL-28).\n\n203.\n\nTo determine whether the dispute submitted to international arbitration has already been \"referred to... courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party,\" the Respondents champion the \"fundamental basis\" test, while rejecting the \"restrictive\" \"triple identity\" test proposed by the Claimants.276 At the hearing, the Respondents acknowledged that the \"triple identity\" test's criteria are not met in this case.277 However, according to the Respondents, the three requirements of the triple identity test - identity of parties, cause, and object - combine to rob Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT of \"any practical effect.\"278 The Respondents explain that this \"practical ineffectiveness\" of the triple identity test is noted by numerous commentators, who have proposed to replace it by the fundamental basis test, a \"more appropriate test\" that grants \"practical meaning\" to fork in the road provisions in investment treaties.279 In applying the fundamental basis test, the Tribunal must examine \"whether the \u2018fundamental basis' of a claim is autonomous of claims heard in other fora\" and \"whether the substance of the factual complaint is the same.\"280 The fundamental basis test was applied in *Pantechniki S.A.Contractors and Engineers v. Republic of Albania* (\"*Pantechniki*\") *,* with reference to the *Woodruff Case* (\"***Woodruff***\") and *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (\"***Vivendi***\").281 According to the Respondents, the *Pantechniki* tribunal held that, in that case, \"the arbitration concerned a claim which, although brought on a different legal basis to the court applications, was brought on the same fundamental basis as the court cases.\"282 This precluded jurisdiction as a result of the fork in the road provision of the bilateral investment treaty invoked.283\n\nMemorial, paras. 164-186; Reply, paras. 192-199.\n\nHearing Transcript 65:12-66:4.\n\nMemorial, para. 166.\n\nMemorial, paras. 165-67; Reply, paras. 192-93; Hearing Transcript 66:5-22.\n\nMemorial, para. 167; Reply, paras. 197-98, quoting Exhibit RL-66.\n\nMemorial, paras.167-174, referring to Exhibit RL-8, *Pantechniki S.A.Contractors and Engineers v.

While this arbitration and the proceedings before the Administrative Court do not have the \"exact same legal bases,\" \"the bases of the claims\" are the same in both instances, as both are based on the \"same alleged conduct of Mongolia, i.e. the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses.\"285 Thus, before the Administrative Court, the Claimants sought \"a declaration of the Court that the NEA's purported action to invalidate the mining licenses was itself invalid.\"286 Similarly, in the present arbitration, the Claimants argue for an award on the basis of, *inter alia*, the Respondents' alleged \"illegal invalidation of the mining and exploration licenses.\"287 While the Claimants argue that no ECT claims were invoked before the Administrative Court, the Respondents submit that the Claimants' \"ECT claims do not exist independently of their contractual claims.\"288\n\nMemorial, paras. 176-86.\n\nMemorial, para. 182.\n\nMemorial, para. 184.\n\nMemorial, para. 184; Hearing Transcript 69:1-70:1, referring to the Notice of Arbitration.\n\nMemorial, para. 183.\n\n205.\n\nThe Respondents also argue that Article 25 of the Foreign Investment Law specifically grants Mongolian courts jurisdiction over disputes such as this one.289 The Respondents add that the Claimants multiply their legal proceedings to \"put pressure\" on Mongolia.290\n\nHearing Transcript 69:23-70:8.\n\nMemorial, para. 186.\n\n206.\n\nIn addition, the Respondents contend that the Claimants' arguments are internally contradictory. Thus, while arguing that the case before the Administrative Court did not involve any alleged ECT breach, the Claimants simultaneously argue that the mention of \"Khan Mongolia having suffered illegality and injustice at the hands of the NEA (in the [Letter to the Prime Minister])\" - the very facts on which their case before the Administrative Court was based - allows them to bring a claim under the ECT.291 Moreover, while the Claimants assert that the proceedings before the Administrative Court and this Tribunal are distinct, they also invoke the Administrative Court proceedings as evidence in this arbitration.292\n\nMemorial, para. 189.\n\nReply, paras. 189-191 [emphasis in the original].\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the limitation contemplated in Article 26(3)(b) of the ECT has not been triggered, regardless of the applicable set of criteria, as the present dispute between Khan Netherlands and Mongolia has not been submitted to any other forum.293\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 287, 294.\n\n208.\n\nWith respect to the administrative action filed by CAUC, the Claimants indicate that the Respondents have failed to explain how an action filed by CAUC could trigger the ECT fork in the road provision *vis-\u00e0-vis* Khan Netherlands.294\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 267.\n\n209.\n\nAs for the administrative action filed by Khan Mongolia, it did not involve \"the same parties, the same legal claims, the same subject matter, the same relief requested, the same underlying facts or the same \u2018fundamental bases'\" as the present proceeding.295\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 329; Rejoinder, para. 181.\n\n210.\n\nThe Claimants find inexplicable the Respondents' assertion that \"the ECT claims do not exist independently of their contractual claims, as the same arguments could have been made before the Mongolian Courts.\"296 According to the Claimants, none of the claims brought before the Administrative Court were based on contract and neither Khan Netherlands nor Khan Mongolia is a party to any contract with Mongolia.297\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 271, quoting Memorial, para. 183.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 271.\n\n211.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondents have not provided any \"substantive information\" or \"reasoned analysis\" of any similarity between the administrative proceedings and this arbitration.298 The Claimants note that even if there were any such similarity, the Claimants are not \"unsatisfied\" with the Administrative Court's decisions, as the Respondents allege, but rather with the conduct of Mongolia, which has refused to recognize or take any action based on the Administrative Court's decision.299\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 268.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 270, 281-282, 287.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants argue that to determine whether any other tribunal has previously considered the \"dispute\" in this arbitration, the Tribunal should first consider the definition of \"dispute\" in Article 26(1) of the ECT. This provision refers to three elements: \"parties (\u2018between a Contracting Party and an Investor'); subject matter (\u2018relating to an Investment'); and legal grounds (\u2018concerning an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III of the ECT').\"300 As the proceeding brought by Khan Mongolia against the NEA before the Administrative Court involved neither a breach of the ECT, nor an \"Investor\" for purposes of the ECT, this proceeding did not pertain to the same \"dispute\" as the one presently before the Tribunal.301\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 289-290, quoting ECT, Art. 26(1); Hearing Transcript 175:10-25.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 291.\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimants further allege that the ECT's definition of a \"dispute\" largely reflects what is known as the \"triple identity\" test, which requires an identity of parties, legal grounds, and subject matter or, in its only distinction from the ECT's definition of a dispute, relief.302 The Claimants submit that the Tribunal should accept the triple identity test, because its relevance to the application of fork in the road provisions such as Article 26(3)(b) of the ECT and to Article 26(3)(b) itself is \"supported by the weight of arbitral authority.\"303\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 292; Hearing Transcript 177:1-4.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 294-297, 300, referring to Exhibit CLA-58, *Lauder v.

The administrative case was based solely on the NEA's alleged non-compliance, in its issuance of notifications and resolutions purporting to invalidate Khan Mongolia's Exploration License, with procedural requirements of Mongolian law.304 All the facts underlying the complaint revolved around the notifications and resolutions issued by the NEA.305\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 273, 283, 298.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 272, 274-280.\n\n215.\n\nFurthermore, the Administrative Court identified the legal bases for its conclusions as Articles 26.3, 26.4, and 26.5 of the NEL, and Articles 1 and 2 of the Law on Regulation for Implementation of Nuclear Energy Law.306 The Administrative Court made no determination as to whether the NEA's actions breached any investor protection standards.307\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 280.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 283, 298.\n\n216.\n\nBy contrast, in the present arbitration, the Tribunal does not need, and is not empowered, to determine whether the NEA's invalidation of the Exploration License was in violation of procedural requirements of Mongolian law.308 The NEA's breach of Mongolian law would constitute no more than one of the many facts evidencing Mongolia's violation of its obligations under Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT.309\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 273.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 284.\n\n217.\n\nIndeed, the primary relevance to this arbitration of the decisions of the Administrative Court is that Mongolia chose to disregard them, thus showing that its actions were not motivated by legitimate regulatory concerns, but were \"simply an illegal taking of [the] Claimants' investments.\"310\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 273.\n\n218.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants observe that the relief requested of the Administrative Court and this Tribunal is different.311 Before the Administrative Court, Khan Mongolia requested a declaration that the NEA's actions were invalid as a matter of Mongolian law. In contrast, before this Tribunal, Khan Netherlands is requesting compensation for the total loss of its investment in Mongolia.312\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 299.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 272, 285-286, 299.\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that the Respondents rely on three international decisions, *Woodruff*, *Vivendi*, and *Pantechniki*, to argue for the use of a \"fundamental basis\" test in the application of Article 26(3)(b) of the ECT. However, according to the Claimants, the cited cases do little to support the Respondents' argument.313\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 301, 306.\n\n220.\n\nFirst, the Claimants specify that *Woodruff,* a 1903 decision of the U.S.-Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission concerning Venezuela's failure to re-pay bonds issued under a concession agreement, stands for the proposition that \"where a claim brought on the international plane is \u2018fundamentally based on a [domestic law] contract,' an exclusive forum selection clause in that contract should be respected - *although without prejudice to the right to pursue further remedies based on causes of action in international law*.\"314\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 301-305, quoting Exhibit CLA-69, *Woodruff*, para. 160 (emphasis added).\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimants further observe that in *Vivendi,* the tribunal's dismissal of the claims on the merits because the adjudication of those claims would violate the exclusive jurisdiction clause of the underlying concession agreement was annulled by an ICSID annulment committee decision. In doing so, the annulment committee invoked the \"fundamental basis\" test not in the context of a fork in the road provision, but rather to \"dispel the notion that the mere existence of a contractual forum selection clause could preclude investment treaty arbitration.\"315\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 307, 312.\n\n222.\n\n*Vivendi* also stands for the proposition that fork in the road provisions are triggered where (i) jurisdiction under the treaty is not limited to claims for treaty breaches; and (ii) the disputes in the national and international fora are \"coextensive.\"316\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 311-314, quoting Exhibit CL-68, *Vivendi*, para. 55.\n\n223.\n\nIn this respect, the Claimants contend that jurisdiction under the ECT is certainly limited to claims based on breaches of the Treaty. Further, the issues before the Administrative Court and this Tribunal are not coextensive. Thus, this Tribunal must not determine the legality of the NEA's conduct under Mongolian law, but rather whether Mongolia's \"disregard for the Administrative Court's ruling and its subsequent development of the Dornod Project\" breached Mongolia's obligations under the ECT.317\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 315.\n\n224.\n\nFinally, the Claimants note that *Pantechniki*, an ICSID case concerning money owed by Albania under a contractual provision, is the only decision mentioned by the Respondents or known to the Claimants to employ the \"fundamental basis\" test in the context of a fork in the road provision.318 In that case, the Albanian courts had already dismissed the investor's claims, and the investor resorted to arbitration under the Greece-Albania bilateral investment treaty \"rather than [pursuing] an appeal in Albania.\"319\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 316-321.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 319.\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the sole arbitrator in *Pantechniki* based his decision that he lacked jurisdiction on the fact that Albania's failure to comply with a contractual provision, which had already been declared to be null by the Albanian courts, was the only conduct identified by the claimant as capable of constituting a breach of the relevant investment treaty. In this case, however, Khan Netherlands' claims are not based on Mongolia's breach of a domestic law contract.320\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 320; Hearing Transcript 183:10-184:4.\n\n226.\n\nAdditionally, unlike the investor in *Pantechniki*, Khan Netherlands is not seeking the same remedy before the national and international tribunals.321\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 319, 321.\n\n227.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants state that \"this arbitration is based on fundamentally different legal claims and a factual predicate that goes far beyond the limited procedural issues before the Administrative Court.\"322 The factual basis for Khan Netherlands' claims of ECT violations before this Tribunal is based on Mongolia's pursuit of a joint venture with Russian interests to develop the Dornod Project without the Claimants, and the Government's related decision to invalidate and refuse to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses, to disregard the 2010 MOU, to disseminate false information about Khan Netherlands, and finally to disregard the decision of the Administrative Court. By contrast, the factual basis for Khan Mongolia's claim before the Administrative Court consisted of the NEA's failure to comply with the requirements of administrative due process in formulating its notifications to Khan Mongolia.323 Consequently, the fundamental basis test, to the extent that the Tribunal finds it relevant, is not satisfied in the present case.324\n\nCounter-memorial, 321.\n\nHearing Transcript 180:1-181:6.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 321; Rejoinder, paras. 182-183.\n\n228.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants argue that even if the dispute before this Tribunal were the same as the one before the Administrative Court, Mongolia's disregard for that court's decision nonetheless constitutes an independent basis for Khan Netherlands to pursue a treaty claim against Mongolia under the ECT.325\n\nHearing Transcript 184:5-184:14.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimants add that the Mongolian statement of policies provided with respect to Annex ID of the ECT does not support the Respondents' fork in the road objection.326\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 322-328.\n\n230.\n\nFinally, the Claimants assert that the Respondents \"have conceded their objection under ECT Article 26(3)(b)(i)\" in their Reply, as they did not attempt to rebut any of the Claimants' submissions regarding the application of this provision and did not challenge the Claimants' submission that the fundamental basis test is not satisfied in this case.327 In particular, by not contesting and in part even confirming the Claimants' characterization of the proceeding brought by Khan Mongolia before the Administrative Court, the Respondents have conceded that the fundamental basis of the claims brought by Khan Mongolia before the Administrative Court was completely different from the fundamental basis of the claims presently before the Tribunal.328\n\nRejoinder, paras. 180-183.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 184-186, referring to Reply, paras. 48, 155.\n\n**3. Whether Khan Netherlands has complied with the waiting period requirement of Article 26(2) of the ECT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondents' position*\n---------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction because Khan Netherlands has not made any valid attempt to settle the dispute amicably and has thus failed to comply with the procedure set forth in Article 26 of the ECT.329\n\nMemorial, para. 136.\n\n232.\n\nArticle 26(1) and (2) of the Treaty provides:\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondents submit that, as confirmed by numerous arbitral tribunals, in stipulating a three-month waiting period following the request to settle the dispute amicably, Article 26(2) of the ECT creates a jurisdictional, rather than \"merely\" procedural, requirement, failure to comply with which deprives the tribunal of jurisdiction.330\n\nMemorial, paras. 138, 140-146, referring to Exhibit RL-33, *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets*, *L.P. v.

In this context, cooperation implies that parties must attempt to settle a dispute amicably despite the complexity of the dispute and the unforeseeability of the outcome of the amicable dispute resolution process.332 Moreover, the Respondents assert that, in the present case, there was no sign that Mongolia would have willfully refused to negotiate.333\n\nReply, paras. 167-171, 174.\n\nReply, paras. 175-176.\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondents also submit that the Claimants did not comply with the mandatory waiting period of three months from the request to settle the dispute amicably.334 Contrary to the Claimants' assertion, the Letter to the Prime Minister did not trigger the three-month period, as it does not constitute the request for amicable settlement contemplated by Article 26 of the ECT, lacking the necessary elements of such a request set out in Article 26(1).335\n\nMemorial, paras. 136, 139, 155; Reply, paras. 164, 177.\n\nMemorial, paras. 147-148, 155; Reply, para. 185.\n\n237.\n\nFirst, the letter does not relate to an \"Investor of another Contracting Party.\" Sent by Khan Canada, it contains no mention of Khan Netherlands.336 Second, the letter makes no mention of any disputes \"which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the [Contracting Party] under Part III [of the Treaty].\"337 The letter concerns exclusively breaches of Mongolian law, rather than Mongolia's alleged ECT breaches. Yet, in *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (\"***Burlington***\"), the tribunal stated that a dispute under a treaty \"only arises once an allegation of [t]reaty breach is made\" and found that the applicable six-month waiting period would begin only at that point in time.338 Third, the letter did not attempt to settle the dispute amicably. It contained neither offers to negotiate nor any suggestion of a potential settlement.339 Instead, the letter was \"aggressive[...]\" and \"threatening,\" reflecting the Claimants' policy of negative publicity and intimidation against the Respondents.340 In fact, the Claimants publicized the letter on their website and, on the very day it was sent, commenced proceedings against the NEA in the Mongolian courts.341\n\nMemorial, para. 149; Reply, paras. 181-182, 185; Hearing Transcript 62:9-12.\n\nMemorial, para. 150; Reply, paras. 182-184.\n\nReply, para. 183, quoting Exhibit RL-61, *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010, para. 336 (\"*Burlington*\").\n\nAt the hearing, however, counsel for the Respondents stated that the Letter to the Prime Minister was \"offering apparently negotiation\" (Hearing Transcript 23:6-24:5).\n\nReply, paras. 178-179.\n\nMemorial, paras. 151-154; Reply, paras. 177-179.\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimants submit that far from seeking to disregard the requirements of Article 26 of the Treaty, they have actually complied with that provision.342\n\nRejoinder, para. 190.\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimants argue that given the stipulation in Article 26(1) that disputes shall be settled amicably \"if possible\" and the conditional language of Article 26(2), the relevant inquiry for purposes of these provisions is whether the dispute in question can or cannot be settled amicably.343\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 332-333.\n\n240.\n\nMoreover, according to the Claimants, the ECT, unlike some other investment treaties, does not require a formal, written, specific, notice of a dispute, but only a good faith \"request\" for amicable settlement. As confirmed by the *Salini Construttori S. P.A. and Italstrade S.P.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco* (\"***Salini***\") and *Limited Liability Company Amto v. Ukraine* (\"***Amto***\") decisions, given the ordinary meaning of the word \"request,\" the investor need only make its problems known to the host state's decision-makers and ask that they be resolved.344\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 334-340, 351, referring to Exhibit CLA-77, *Salini Construttori S.P.A. and Italstrade S.P.A. v.

Ukraine*, SCC Case No. 080/2005, Final Award of 26 March 2008, para. 189.\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that they complied with the requirements of Article 26(1) and (2) by sending the Letter to the Prime Minister on 15 April 2010. The letter refers to the \"ongoing unlawful and unjust actions being taken by the Nuclear Energy Agency,\" including the NEA's purported invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses, and specifically requests the Prime Minister of Mongolia to \"exercise [his] authority to review and overturn the NEA's decisions\" and \"to closely examine and assist [the Claimants] in rectifying the NEA's unlawful actions.\"345\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 343.\n\n242.\n\nMoreover, the Letter to the Prime Minister mentions that Mr. Quick, Khan Canada's President and CEO, \"would appreciate an opportunity to speak directly\" with the Prime Minister of Mongolia or his staff.346 In the Claimants' view, the fact that this letter was sent on Khan Canada's letterhead does not vitiate its character as a request for amicable settlement between Khan Netherlands and the Respondents, as Khan Canada represented the interests of all its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Khan Netherlands and Khan Mongolia.347\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 343-345, quoting Exhibit C-15; Rejoinder, para. 189.\n\nRejoinder, para. 191.\n\n243.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Mongolia was well aware of Khan Netherlands' interest in the issues canvassed in the Letter to the Prime Minister, as the FIFTA was informed of Khan Netherlands' majority ownership of Khan Mongolia in May 2008, and as this ownership was set forth in the 2010 MOU.348\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 346-349.\n\n244.\n\nMoreover, a request for amicable settlement under the ECT need not refer to specific breaches of the Treaty. The *Burlington* case invoked by the Respondents was concerned with a treaty that did not condition submission to arbitration on an attempt to settle the dispute amicably, but only on the passing of six months. Thus, *Burlington* did not analyze the question of whether a request for amicable settlement must contain allegations of treaty breach. As for *Burlington* 's wider proposition that a dispute \"only arises once an allegation of [t]reaty breach is made,\" it is contrary to the weight of authority on the question, as evidenced by the *Maffezini v. Spain* decision.349\n\nRejoinder, paras. 192-195, referring to Exhibit CLA-11, *Maffezini v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decicision on Jurisdiction dated 25 Jan. 2000, para. 96.\n\n245.\n\nIn any event, seen in its full context, this phrase from *Burlington* does not support the conclusion that the Claimants have failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 26 of the ECT. In fact, the *Burlington* tribunal specified that an investor should not be required \"to spell out its legal case in detail... [or] even... to invoke specific [t]reaty provisions...\" but need only \"apprize the host State of the likely consequences that would follow should the negotiation process break down.\"350 The Letter to the Prime Minister did just that by informing Mongolia of the possibility of resort to international arbitration.351\n\nRejoinder, para. 196.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 196-197.\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimants also recall that after the Letter to the Prime Minister, numerous further efforts were made to achieve an amicable settlement, including three trips to Mongolia by Khan Canada's officers and directors.352\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 352; Rejoinder, para. 189.\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimants submit that since an amicable dispute resolution provision aims to allow parties to engage in good faith negotiations, such a provision cannot preclude the Tribunal from having jurisdiction where any further attempts at negotiation would have been futile.353\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 354-356.\n\n248.\n\nIn the present case, based on the lack of positive response to any of Khan's efforts to achieve an amicable settlement and the \"larger set of circumstances surrounding the claims before the Tribunal,\" it was clear that amicable settlement of Khan Netherlands' dispute with Mongolia was impossible.354\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 350, 353, 356; Rejoinder, para. 189.\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondents adduce no evidence in support of their assertion to the contrary. In particular, the Respondents fail to give any explanation for the \"obvious\" questions arising in this connection, such as why Mongolia refused to honor the 2010 MOU and the decisions of the Administrative Court; why the NEA sent an inflammatory letter concerning Khan to the Toronto Stock Exchange in March 2010; why no Mongolian official ever responded to the Letter to the Prime Minister; why Mr. Edey was advised that an amicable resolution would be difficult to achieve given Mr. Enkhbat's opposition to Khan's participation in the Dornod Project; why Mr. Enkhbat publicly insulted Khan and stated that it would never get its licenses and; why Mongolia entered into an agreement with Russia for the development of the Dornod Project, even as the Claimants remained the project's legitimate owners.355\n\nRejoinder, paras. 50-51, 198-200.\n\n**4. Whether Khan Netherlands' claims are barred by operation of Article 17(1) of the ECT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondents' position*\n---------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondents submit that Article 17(1) of the ECT, its denial of benefits provision, applies in the present case to exclude the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Khan Netherlands' claims under the ECT.356\n\nMemorial, paras. 199-200.\n\n251.\n\nArticle 17(1) of the ECT provides, in relevant part:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of... Part [III of the Treaty] to:\n\n(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized..\"\n\n252.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, given the Treaty's purpose to \"foster mutual cooperation for the benefit of the signatories to the Treaty,\" the aim of Article 17(1) of the Treaty is that ECT benefits be awarded to \"genuine nationals of contracting party states,\" but denied to \"investors which ha[ve] no real connection with a Contracting Party, even if technically they [are] organized within one of those contracting states,\" the so-called \"mailbox companies.\"357\n\nMemorial, paras. 189-192, quoting ECT, Art.2.\n\n253.\n\nThe Respondents submit that if they can show that Khan Netherlands is a mailbox company within the meaning of Article 17(1) of the ECT, *i.e.*, that (i) \"nationals of a third state own or control\" Khan Netherlands and (ii) Khan Netherlands \"has no substantial business activities\" in the Netherlands, then Mongolia may deny Khan Netherlands the advantages of Part III of the Treaty in this arbitration.358 This denial also includes denial of the advantages of Article 26 of the ECT because this provision, invoked as the jurisdictional basis of Khan Netherlands' ECT claims, applies only to alleged breaches of Part III of the ECT.359\n\nMemorial, paras. 193-194; Hearing Transcript 73:15-75:5.\n\nMemorial, paras. 193-194.\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondents acknowledge that recent arbitral decisions are inconclusive regarding the application of Article 17(1) of the ECT.360 Of the four recent \"notable\" decisions on this matter, two, namely, the *Plama Consortium v. Bulgaria* (\"***Plama***\") and *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. the Russian Federation* (\"***Yukos***\") decisions on jurisdiction, have found that the right to deny the benefits of the ECT must be exercised actively by the host state and with exclusively prospective effect, *i.e*., before the investment is made and the arbitration commenced.361\n\nMemorial, paras. 199-200.\n\nMemorial, paras. 200-203, 209-210, 212, referring to Exhibit RL-22, *Plama Consortium v.

Kyrgyz Republic (\"* ***Petrobart*** \") and *Amto,* directly proceeded to consider whether on the facts of the case the relevant entity fell within the description of Article 17(1) of the ECT, \"on the basis that the benefits would be denied if the conditions of Article 17 were fulfilled,\"363 \"as if the exercise of the [host state's] right [to deny benefits] could be made upon the exercise of the investor's rights, that is, at the outset of the arbitration.\"364 In *Amto*, as in *Plama*, the tribunal examined the purpose of the ECT, but attached a particular significance to the reciprocal nature of the ECT and to the reference to \"complementarities\" and \"mutual benefits\" in the expression of the Treaty's objective in its Article 2.365\n\nMemorial, paras. 205-208, referring to Exhibit CLA-64/RL-20, *Amto*, Exhibit CLA-101/RL-23, *Petrobart Limited v.

Reply, para. 262; see also Hearing Transcript 74:2375:5, referring to ECT, Arts. 26(3)(b)(iii), 26(4), and 27(1)(2).\n\nMemorial, para. 220.\n\n258.\n\nThe Respondents add that commentators consider *Plama* 's reference to the Treaty's purpose as \"fallacious\" and \"one-sided.\"370 For instance, in quoting the Treaty's purpose as expressed in its Article 2, the tribunal in *Plama* omits the words \"complementarities and mutual benefits,\" thus ignoring the \"reciprocal elements of the [Treaty].\"371\n\nMemorial, paras. 224, 226.\n\nMemorial, paras. 223-227.\n\n259.\n\nMoreover, the Respondents observe that the view that the exclusively prospective effect of the denial of benefits is necessary to protect the legitimate expectations of investors is criticized, because \"a company controlled by nationals of a third state and which has no activity in the state in which it is incorporated has no legitimate expectation of protection under the Treaty.\"372\n\nMemorial, para. 228, quoting Exhibit RL-5, para. 71.\n\n260.\n\nFinally, the *Plama* interpretation has \"utterly impractical consequences,\" as it imposes on the host state the obligation to review \"every corporate structure, down to its smallest of subsidiaries and empty mailbox companies that may be contained somewhere within the investors' group, of every investment that is made within its territory\" if it wishes to avail itself of its rights under Article 17(1) of the ECT.373\n\nMemorial, paras. 230-232.\n\n261.\n\nIn addition, the Respondents submit that the Claimants' interpretation of Article 17(1) of the Treaty, derived from the *Plama* and *Yukos* decisions, runs contrary to the rules of treaty interpretation found at Article 31 of the VCLT.374 With respect to the \"ordinary meaning\" of Article 17(1) of the ECT, the Respondents assert that the statement that a state \"reserves the right to\" deny benefits does not suggest that any further action is necessary to exercise the denial of benefits.375\n\nReply, paras. 248-250, 268.\n\nReply, paras. 252-253.\n\n262.\n\nThis meaning of \"to reserve a right\" is confirmed by the Oxford English Dictionary, numerous commentators, and the French and Spanish versions of the Treaty.376 The heading of Article 17(1) of the ECT and Part C(2)(11) of the ECT Reader's Guide also indicate that the denial of benefits is not an option.377 By contrast, where the authors of other treaties wished to subject the use of a denial of benefits clause to prior notice, they inserted an explicit compulsory requirement of notification, as in Article 1113(2) of the North-American Free Trade Agreement and Article 18(2) of the 2004 Canada Model BIT.378\n\nReply, paras. 251-259.\n\nReply, paras. 260-264.\n\nReply, paras. 265-267, referring to Exhibits CLA-73, RL-81.\n\n263.\n\nRegarding the object and purpose of the ECT, the Respondents submit that their interpretation does not \"incentivize states to be non-transparent in their implementation of ECT policies\" contrary to the Treaty's goal to create \"stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions for Investors,\" because investors are on notice by virtue of Article 17(1) of the ECT, as explained above.379 Rather, it is the Claimants' position that incentivizes investors to be nontransparent by keeping \"quiet about the structure of their investment.\"380\n\nReply, paras. 269-271, quoting Counter-memorial, para. 380; ECT, Art. 10.1\n\nReply, para. 272; Hearing Transcript 77:1-8.\n\n264.\n\nFinally, with respect to \"subsequent practice,\" the Respondents highlight that whereas the Claimants assert that states may exercise their right under Article 17(1) of the ECT by making a \"blanket\" denial of advantages towards all companies caught by the provision's definition, tellingly the Claimants have not identified a single blanket denial of this sort.381 In any event, such a blanket denial would constitute a \"reservation\" prohibited by Article 46 of the Treaty.382\n\nReply, paras. 273-274, 276; Hearing Transcript 78:18-23.\n\nReply, para. 275; Hearing Transcript 77:20-78:23.\n\n265.\n\nIn their Memorial, the Respondents state that the preferred view of legal commentators and the one that should be adopted by the Tribunal is that the host state's right to deny ECT benefits can be exercised at the start of any dispute, when the state becomes aware of a mailbox company investor that is attempting, despite being controlled by nationals of a non-ECT Contracting Party, to obtain the advantages of the Treaty.383 At the hearing, the Respondents explained that where the two conditions of Article 17(1) (ownership or control by nationals of a third state and lack of substantial business activities in the state of incorporation) are met, Article 17(1) provides \"directly for the non-application\" of Part III of the Treaty, without requiring that the state take any \"additional action to deny benefits\" and without any \"temporal limits\" on the exercise of the state's right to deny benefits.384\n\nMemorial, para. 235.\n\nHearing Transcript 74:17-75:9.\n\n266.\n\nThe Respondents further submit that, in the present case, the Tribunal is \"faced with the application of Article 17(1) to the exact situation for which it was designed.\"385 In particular, the Respondents assert that the Claimants have admitted that Khan Netherlands is owned and controlled by nationals of a third state - Canada - which is not party to the ECT, and that Khan Netherlands is a \"mailbox\" company, with \"no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized.\"386 As a result, the Tribunal is faced with an entirely new question, as all the above-referenced decisions concerning the operation of Article 17(1) were ultimately decided on the basis that one or the other of the two factual conditions of Article 17(1) was not met.387\n\nMemorial, paras. 238, 240.\n\nMemorial, para. 239, quoting ECT, Art. 17(1), and paras. 195-197; Reply, para. 279; Hearing Transcript 79:3-80:12. This is confirmed by the Claimants in their Counter-memorial, para. 360.\n\nHearing Transcript 80:13-82:7.\n\n267.\n\nMoreover, the Respondents submit that even if Article 17(1) of the ECT is interpreted to require an active denial of benefits, in the present case Mongolia has not had a \"realistic opportunity\" to exercise its right to deny ECT benefits. This is because Khan Netherlands was created and inserted into the Claimants' corporate structure after the Claimants had been notified of their breaches of Mongolian regulations and coinciding with the Claimants' negative publicity campaign against the Respondents.388 Moreover, Khan Netherlands was given a \"low profile\" even after its incorporation.389\n\nMemorial, para. 257.\n\nMemorial, paras. 242-249, 252; Reply, para. 273. At the hearing, the Respondents explained that while Khan Netherlands may have been registered in Mongolia in May 2008, \"this is not the same people in the government who are dealing with this registration process\" (Hearing Transcript 88:2-5). The Respondents emphasized that no mention of Khan Netherlands was made to the NEA or the Mongolian Ministry of Energy and Mines between 2008 and 2010 and that even in the Letter to the Prime Minister, Khan Netherlands was not named (Hearing Transcript 88:6-89:9).\n\n268.\n\nThe Respondents argue, therefore, that if the Claimants' approach to Article 17(1) of the ECT were taken, Mongolia would be faced with the \"impossible task\" not only of examining the corporate structure of every investment made in its territory, but also of constantly monitoring changes in this structure.390\n\nMemorial, paras. 252-254; Hearing Transcript 77:9-15.\n\n269.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondents submit that Article 17(1) was drafted specifically to avoid the benefit of the Treaty being extended to an entity such as Khan Netherlands, which was created in the lead up to this arbitration as a \"cynical attempt\" or \"subterfuge\" to allow Khan Canada, a Canadian entity, to obtain the benefit of the ECT, despite the fact that Canada has not adhered to the Treaty.391\n\nMemorial, paras. 255-257; Hearing Transcript 85:14-90:2.\n\n270.\n\nAmong \"further notable elements,\" the Respondents stress that the investment was made without any involvement by Khan Netherlands, which was incorporated only in 2007, after the Claimants' alleged investments in Mongolia.392 It is thus \"misleading\" for the Claimants to assert that if \"capital could not have been channeled through a Dutch company, it may never have been invested in the first place.\"393\n\nMemorial, paras. 241-242; Reply, para. 206.\n\nReply, para. 206, quoting Counter-memorial, para. 398.\n\n271.\n\nIn addition, the Respondents contend that the Claimants are incorrect in stating that mailbox companies have been led to expect to receive the protections of Part III of the ECT by reason of the Treaty's wide definition of \"investor.\"394 The Claimants' reading of the ECT is \"myopic,\" as it \"surgically remov[es]\" Article 17(1) from the ECT.395 In fact, Article 17(1) is an exception to the definition of \"investor\" found in Article 1(7) of the Treaty.396\n\nReply, paras. 203-204.\n\nReply, paras. 205, 216.\n\nHearing Transcript 83:14-85:10.\n\n272.\n\nAccordingly, investors can plan their investments on the basis of the notice given by Article 17(1) that if they fall within the definition of this provision, they may not rely on the protections of the ECT.397 Wide definitions of \"investor\" have been coupled with denial of benefits clauses in other instruments, such as the 2004 US Model BIT.398 A state is free to limit its consent to arbitration in a treaty, and the investor may \"accept or decline the offer to arbitrate, but cannot vary its terms.\"399\n\nReply, para. 207.\n\nReply, paras. 211-214.\n\nReply, paras. 208-209.\n\n273.\n\nThus, the Respondents' interpretation of Article 17(1) of the ECT does not create any injustice for the investor. In order to benefit from the ECT, the investor can always structure its activities so as to have \"substantial\" business activities in a Contracting Party.400 Nor does it make any sense to argue, as the Claimants do, that Mongolia's intentions in signing the ECT can be inferred from the Netherlands-Mongolia BIT, as there is no reason to believe that a state wishes to engage itself in the same way toward one other state by means of a BIT as toward an unlimited number of states by way of a unilateral treaty.401\n\nReply, para. 210.\n\nReply, para. 215.\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimants are also incorrect in suggesting that the Netherlands has a vested interest in gaining international protection for mailbox companies, in particular Special Financial Institutions. In fact, multiple sources note that Special Financial Institutions do not contribute substantially to the Dutch economy.402\n\nReply, paras. 217-224, referring to Exhibits C-112, RL-69, RL-70, RL-71.\n\n275.\n\nFinally, the Claimants are incorrect in claiming that investors and states should be expected to act in accordance with arbitral decisions, and in particular that Mongolia should have conformed with *Plama* and Y *ukos*, as there is no doctrine of precedent in international arbitration.403 In fact, the authority of an arbitral tribunal's decision is limited to the parties which have agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration; the arbitral decision cannot have any impact on parties not bound by the arbitration agreement.404\n\nReply, paras. 225-232.\n\nReply, para. 228.\n\n276.\n\nEven if it were accepted that states should form policy on the basis of arbitral decisions, this reasoning is inapplicable to the present case, in the absence of an accepted line of authority existing at the relevant time. When Khan Netherlands was created in 2007 and when the Claimants' claims crystallized sometime in or around October 2009, of the three decisions considering Article 17(1) of the ECT, two, namely, *Petrobart* and *Amto*, supported the Respondents' interpretation, and the third, *Plama,* had been criticized by legal commentators. The *Yukos* decision, which the Claimants state confirms the reasoning in *Plama*, had not yet been rendered.405\n\nReply, paras. 234-238.\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n277.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Mongolia cannot at this stage deny Khan Netherlands the advantages of Part III of the ECT with regard to its pre-existing investments pursuant to Article 17(1) of the Treaty. At the outset, the Claimants highlight that Article 26 of the ECT, concerning dispute settlement, is not included in Part III of the ECT and thus falls outside the scope of Article 17(1). For this reason, the interpretation of Article 17(1) is not a question of jurisdiction.406 Nonetheless, the Claimants note that the Parties have agreed to resolve the applicability of Article 17(1) of the ECT in this preliminary phase.407\n\nHearing Transcript 187:4-6.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 360; Hearing Transcript 187:6-187:12.\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimants state that whether Mongolia's right to deny benefits was exercised must be evaluated at the time when the Contracting Party's offer of consent to arbitration is accepted by the investor. In the present case, Mongolia had not exercised its right when the Claimants commenced this arbitration.408\n\nRejoinder, para. 217.\n\n279.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondents argue that Article 17(1) at once constitutes an automatic denial of benefits by all the ECT contracting parties to all companies meeting the criteria of Article 17(1) and reserves a Contracting Party the right to deny an investor the advantages of Part III of the ECT at any time with regard to its pre-existing investments. Contrary to the Respondents' assertion, the Claimants reject the Respondents dual interpretation of Article 17(1) of the ECT not because it is \"unjust,\" but because it is inconsistent with (i) the terms of the ECT, (ii) the object and purpose of the ECT, and (iii) relevant rules of international law.409\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 362, 404; Rejoinder, paras. 207, 250-251.\n\n*(i) Terms of the ECT*\n----------------------\n\n280.\n\nFirst, it is clear, according to the Claimants, that the terms of Article 17(1) of the ECT do not constitute an automatic denial of benefits.410 The Respondents' attempt to analogize Article 17(1) to a limitation on the contracting parties' consent to arbitrate disputes with investors meeting the conditions stipulated therein is \"overtly flawed.\"411 Article 17(1) is not one of the dispute resolution provisions of the ECT and indeed is located in a different part of the Treaty.412 The controlling language, \"reserves the right to,\" indicates that, while a state may deny the benefit of Part III of the ECT to a certain class of investors, the exercise of this right is optional.413\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 364-365; Rejoinder, para. 208.\n\nRejoinder, para. 214.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 213-214.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 365; Rejoinder, para. 215.\n\n281.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondents' attempt to invoke the French and Spanish versions of the ECT is \"unprincipled and disingenuous.\" The Respondents create the impression that contracting parties are reserving their obligation to comply with Part III of the ECT, while both in French and Spanish the object of the verb \"r\u00e9server\" and \"reservar\" is the right of the Contracting Party to deny benefits. As Respondents acknowledge, this means that this right is being retained, and as confirmed by the Macmillan English Dictionary, may or may not be exercised.414\n\nRejoinder, paras. 232-237.\n\n282.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, had the contracting parties to the Treaty intended to uniformly impose a \"real and effective nationality requirement\" as a prerequisite to investor protection, they would have drafted a restrictive definition of \"Investor.\"415 However, because the Treaty's actual definition of \"Investor\" includes \"a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party,\" any entity falling within this definition, including Khan Netherlands, is entitled to the protections of Part III of the Treaty, to the extent that such protections have not been denied by the state in the exercise of its right under Article 17(1) of the ECT.416\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 366.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 366-367, quoting ECT, Art. 1(1); Rejoinder, para. 238.\n\n283.\n\nMoreover, the *Plama* tribunal confirms that Article 17(1) of the ECT does not itself constitute a notice of denial of benefits. If all investors should \"expect\" to be denied the benefits of Part III of the Treaty by all contracting parties, Article 17(1) would be rendered functionally equivalent to a \"real and effective nationality requirement.\"417 Yet it cannot be presumed that the drafters of the Treaty rejected this requirement in the definition of \"Investor,\" but implemented \"a more complicated and equivocal provision just to accomplish the same result.\"418\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 368.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 369.\n\n284.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondents' reference to other investment treaties. Instruments such as model BITs or the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement are not sources of interpretive authority for Article 17(1) of the ECT under the general rules of interpretation for treaties found at Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.\n\n285.\n\nBesides, the Respondents have failed to identify an interpretive authority to indicate that the denial of benefits provisions of these instruments should themselves be interpreted in the way advocated here by the Respondents with regard to Article 17(1) of the ECT.419\n\nRejoinder, paras. 218-221.\n\n286.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondents' reliance on the NAFTA as an example of a treaty referring explicitly to a prior notification is misplaced because the Respondents fail to mention that the NAFTA's explicit notification requirement applies toward the contracting state of which the investor is a national, not toward the investor himself. The mechanism in NAFTA is therefore not comparable to that of the ECT.420\n\nRejoinder, paras. 222-224.\n\n*(ii) Object and purpose of the ECT*\n------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nInterpreting Article 17(1) as allowing the right to deny benefits to be exercised retroactively would undermine the object and purpose of the Treaty, including the preservation of \"complementarities and mutual benefits.\"421\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 370; Rejoinder, paras. 243, 251.\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Treaty does not impose any generic requirements as to ownership, control, or business activities of the investors entitled to the protection of the ECT, because different states take different approaches to international investment holding companies, such as Khan Netherlands.\n\n289.\n\nIn this regard, the Netherlands has a generous approach to international investment holding companies because it derives a significant economic benefit from being the home state to many Special Financial Institutions, which incorporate in its jurisdiction rather than in the domiciles of their parent companies and account for 75 percent of direct investment outflows in the Netherlands.422\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 370-371. The Claimants add that the Respondents' assertion that international investment holding companies provide no benefits to the states in which they incorporate is \"simply wrong.\" In fact, as many states encourage their incorporation, international investment holding companies have become \"an integral component of modern international business\" (Rejoinder, para. 256).\n\n290.\n\nIn this context, Article 17(1) of the ECT serves the interest of maximizing treaty participation by allowing the contracting parties to implement their own policies within the overall framework of the Treaty. A state that does not wish to extend protection to international investment holding companies may exercise its right under Article 17(1) to deny benefits to such entities, while international investment holding companies may choose to invest in another signatory state of the ECT that has not exercised this right.423\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 372-374.\n\n291.\n\nHowever, this balance of interests can only be achieved if the state exercises its right under Article 17(1) of the ECT *ex ante*. Moreover, the host country may derive a benefit in the form of additional investment from declining to exercise its right under Article 17(1) of the ECT.\n\n292.\n\nIn the present case, the investment of capital and technical expertise invested by the Claimants in Mongolia might not have been made had it not been possible to channel the investment through a Dutch company. Thus, if Mongolia is allowed to invoke Article 17(1) at this stage, it will have derived most of the benefits it could expect from the Treaty with none of the corresponding obligations.424 Allowing Mongolia to deny benefits now would also incentivize states to be non-transparent in their implementation of ECT policies, in contradiction with the Treaty's purpose and Mongolia's obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT to create transparent conditions for investment.425\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 375-378.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 380-382.\n\n*(iii) Rules of international law and the ECT*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nIn addition, interpreting Article 17(1) of the ECT as allowing the retroactive exercise of the right to deny benefits would violate the \"relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties,\" and, particularly, the general principle of estoppel.426\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 383-384.\n\n294.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, estoppel \"precludes person A from averring a particular state of things against person B if A had previously, by words or conduct, unambiguously represented to B the existence of a different state of things, and if on the faith of that representation, B had so altered his position that the establishment of the truth would injure him.\"427\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 387, quoting Exhibit CLA-30.\n\n295.\n\nConsequently, in the present case, Mongolia cannot exclude Khan Netherlands from the protections of Part III of the ECT after the company has invested in the Dornod Project in reliance on these protections, given that Mongolia created the presumption that it assented to affording these protections to Dutch international investment holding companies, in particular by failing to exercise its right under Article 17(1) of the ECT and by offering investment protections to such companies in other contexts, for instance through the Netherlands-Mongolia BIT of 1996.428\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 389-390.\n\n296.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants insist that the fact that Article 17(1) of the ECT does not specify a method of notice for the exercise of a state's right to deny benefits under this provision does not entail that no notice is required.429\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 391-393.\n\n297.\n\nThe Claimants also resist the Respondents' assertion that an interpretation allowing only for the prospective exercise of a state's right under Article 17(1) of the ECT strips the provision of effective meaning.430 The Respondents' argument rests entirely on the \"unnecessary assumption\" that the right under Article 17(1) of the ECT would need to be exercised toward each investor individually, thus requiring the host state to investigate all foreign investors in its territory.431\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 391, 397.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 398.\n\n298.\n\nHowever, as explained by the *Plama* tribunal, a state could deny the advantages of Part III of the ECT to a whole class of investors at once, by a \"general declaration in a Contracting Party's official gazette... or a statutory provision.\"432 While the Respondents assert that a general declaration may amount to a reservation to the Treaty, which is prohibited by its Article 46, in the Claimants' view, actions taken in accordance with Article 17(1) of the ECT cannot implicate Article 46, as Article 17(1) forms part of the Treaty and applies equally to all contracting parties.433\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 399-401, quoting Exhibit RL-22, *Plama*, para. 157.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 401-402; Rejoinder, para. 242.\n\n299.\n\nMoreover, even if the Claimants' interpretation deprived Article 17(1) of the ECT of effective meaning, this could not lead the Tribunal to accept the Respondents' alternative interpretation, given that the principle of *effet util* cannot be employed to attribute to a treaty a meaning contrary to its letter and spirit.434\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 397.\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that, even if the decisions in *Plama* and *Yukos* were not \"correct\" in their interpretation of Article 17(1) of the ECT, they nevertheless constitute the \"accepted interpretation\" and entitle investors and signatory states to act accordingly.435\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 404-413.\n\n301.\n\nVarious commentators, including the Respondents' authorities, have thus remarked that the *Plama* and *Yukos* decisions serve \"as notice to all ECT signatories that they should make proactive use of Article 17(1) of the ECT or risk losing its benefit.\"436\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 406-411, quoting CLA-98.\n\n302.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants indicate that the views of legal commentators are not a source of interpretive authority under Article 31 of the VCLT, except to the extent that they reflect or evidence \"relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties,\" and in any event are inferior sources compared to the reasoned decisions of international tribunals who have applied Article 17(1) of the ECT, such as in *Plama* and *Yukos*.437\n\nRejoinder, paras. 225-227.\n\n303.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that the decisions in *Petrobart* and *Amto* cannot be cited as evidence of conflicting authority, because in these proceedings the issue of the contracting parties' obligation to exercise their Article 17(1) right was not raised by the parties.438\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 413, referring to Exhibit CLA-64/RL-20, *Amto*, para. 26(h), Exhibit CLA-101/RL-23, *Petrobart*, paras. 345-346; Rejoinder, para. 265.\n\n304.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimants explain that, contrary to the Respondents' contention, they do not rely on *Plama* and *Yukos* as \"binding precedent.\"439 Nonetheless, consistent decisions of arbitral awards may properly be referenced as evidence of the ordinary meaning of the terms of a provision in their context and in light of the Treaty's object and purpose. Moreover, numerous arbitral tribunals and commentators have observed that tribunals deciding investment cases should, where possible, \"pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals.\"440\n\nRejoinder, para. 261.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 260-263, referring to Exhibits CLA-13, RL-72; Hearing Transcript 188:18-189:19.\n\n305.\n\nAs for the Respondents' reliance on the subsequent practice of contracting parties to the ECT, none of whom have exercised their right to deny benefits under Article 17(1) of the Treaty, it is a *non sequitur*. For omissions to establish a practice, they must be accompanied by some statement or action indicating that they constitute an application of the Treaty. In this case, there is no evidence that any Contracting Party intentionally refrained from exercising a right under Article 17(1), which it otherwise intends to rely upon, because it did not believe that such action was necessary.441\n\nRejoinder, paras. 244-246.\n\n306.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants submit that the Respondents' assertion that a state's right under Article 17(1) of the ECT can be exercised not only with respect to pre-existing investments, but also after arbitration has been initiated, runs contrary to Article 26(3) of the ECT and to the principle that mutual consent to arbitration, once perfected, cannot be unilaterally withdrawn. By Article 26(3) of the ECT, each party gives its \"unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration.\"442 Article 26(5) of the ECT confirms that once an investor has provided its consent to UNCITRAL arbitration of a dispute pursuant to Article 26(4)(b), an agreement to arbitrate is constituted between the investor and the Contracting Party. At that moment, the consent to arbitration is \"perfected\" and can no longer be revoked.443\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 419.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 418.\n\n307.\n\nUnder the Respondents' interpretation of Article 17(1) of the ECT, however, the host state may retroactively limit the scope of its consent to arbitration once its consent is perfected. Thus, in this arbitration, Mongolia is purporting to create new factual circumstances (the exercise of a latent prerogative to deny benefits) and thereby to quash the Tribunal's jurisdiction after both Parties have consented to such jurisdiction.444\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 416-419.\n\n308.\n\nFinally, the Claimants take issue with the Respondents' \"factual misrepresentations,\" in particular denying that Khan Netherlands was created in preparation for this arbitration and any subsequent attempts to conceal the company's existence from the Respondents.445\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 420.\n\n309.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, in fact, while Khan Netherlands was incorporated in 2007, the events leading to the current claims began only with the January 2009 announcement of the forthcoming Russian-Mongolian joint mining venture and could not have been predicted at the time of Khan Netherlands' incorporation. Khan Netherlands' existence was made known to Mongolia in May 2008 through registration with the FIFTA, during the negotiations of the MOU in 2009 and 2010, and in Khan Mongolia's March 2010 letter to Mr. Enkhbat.446\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 138, 420-425; Rejoinder, para. 266.\n\n310.\n\nIn addition, the Respondents are incorrect in stating that all the Claimants' investments in the Dornod Project were made before Khan Netherlands acquired its interest in Khan Mongolia in 2007, as in fact the Claimants made significant investments in 2008 and 2009.447\n\nRejoinder, paras. 253-254.\n\nD. THE TRIBUNAL'S JURISDICTION OVER THE CLAIMANTS' CLAIMS UNDER THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondents' position*\n---------------------------\n\n311.\n\nThe Respondents succinctly submit that pursuant to Article 25 of the Foreign Investment Law, the Mongolian courts are specifically granted jurisdiction over the subject matter of the present dispute, unless a contract or treaty provides otherwise.448 The Respondents note that the Foreign Investment Law itself does not contain any recourse to arbitration.449\n\nMemorial, paras. 11, 36, 186.\n\nMemorial, paras. 11, 36; Hearing Transcript 24:16-20.\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims of all the Claimants against all the Respondents made under the Foreign Investment Law, pursuant to its Article 25.450 This provision states, in relevant part:\n\n\"Disputes between... foreign investors and Mongolian legal or natural persons on the matters relating to foreign investment and the operations of the foreign invested business entity shall be resolved in the Courts of Mongolia unless provided otherwise by international treaties to which Mongolia is a party or by any contract between the parties.\"\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 447.\n\n313.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Khan Canada, Khan Netherlands, and CAUC Holding are all \"foreign investors\" under the Foreign Investment Law.451 The Claimants further state that, as alleged in the Notice of Arbitration, the Respondents, by illegally invalidating the Mining and Exploration Licenses, have breached Articles 8, 9, and 10 of the Foreign Investment Law, as well as Article 16(3) of the Constitution, the protections of which are specifically extended to foreign investors by Article 8(1) of the Foreign Investment Law.452 The Claimants also note that the Respondents \"appear to concede at least that there \u2018is a dispute arising out of the present subject matter.'\"453\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 429-438.\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 439-441.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 442, referring to Memorial, para. 37.\n\n314.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over these claims by virtue of Article 25 of the Foreign Investment Law, which, while it does not contain an independent arbitration clause, provides that where a relevant treaty or contract between Mongolia and the investor provides for international arbitration, Foreign Investment Law claims are to be resolved in arbitration.454\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 426, 427, 443-444.\n\n315.\n\nIn the present case, the Founding Agreement, a \"contract between the parties,\" and the ECT, an \"international treat[y] to which Mongolia is a party,\" both contain enforceable clauses that provide for UNCITRAL arbitration. Therefore, if the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over CAUC Holding's and Khan Canada's claims against MonAtom and Mongolia under the Founding Agreement and over the claims of Khan Netherlands against Mongolia under the ECT, then the Tribunal also has jurisdiction over all of the Claimants' claims against all the Respondents under the Foreign Investment Law.455 The Claimants assert that the Respondents do not contest the Claimants' submissions, demonstrating that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the Foreign Investment Law.456\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 427, 445-447; Rejoinder, para. 127; Hearing Transcript 115:19-118:16.\n\nRejoinder, para. 126; Hearing Transcript 116:1-9.\n\n**VI. RELIEF REQUESTED**\n------------------------\n\n316.\n\nThe Respondents request that the Tribunal decline jurisdiction to hear the claims brought by the Claimants under the Notice of Arbitration.457 In particular, the Respondents request that the Tribunal grant an award on jurisdiction which finds that:\n\n(i) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione personae* over any claims advanced by either Khan Canada or Khan Netherlands, nor over any claims advanced against the Government of Mongolia under the Founding Agreement;\n\n(ii) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione materiae* for any claims advanced under the Founding Agreement;\n\n(iii) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione personae* over any claims advanced by either Khan Canada or [CAUC Holding] under the ECT;\n\n(iv) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over any claims advanced by Khan Netherlands under the ECT on the basis that:\n\n(1) Khan Netherlands has failed to comply with Mongolian law;\n\n(2) Khan Netherlands has failed to respect the required three month waiting period following a request for amicable settlement, as required by Article 26(2);\n\n(3) Mongolia has not given unconditional consent for the submission of this dispute to arbitration by operation of Article 26(3)(b)(1) ECT, as the dispute has previously been submitted for determination by the Mongolian courts; and\n\n(4) Khan Netherlands is denied the benefits of Part III of the ECT in accordance with Article 17(1) ECT.458\n\nMemorial, para. 259; Reply, para. 279.\n\nMemorial, para. 260; Reply, para. 280.\n\n317.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondents request that the Tribunal \"order the Claimants to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration including all the Respondents' legal fees and costs, and associated interest.\"459\n\nMemorial, para. 261; Reply, para. 281.\n\n318.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal should:\n\n(a) Dismiss Respondents' Objections to Jurisdiction;\n\n(b) Proceed to the merits and quantum phase of the arbitration pursuant to the schedule set forth in paragraphs 3.7-3.11 of Procedural Order No.1;\n\n(c) Award [the] Claimants their costs and attorney's fees; and\n\n(d) Order such other relief as counsel may advise and/or as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.460\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 448; Rejoinder, para. 267.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nBelow, the Tribunal first addresses the burden of proof arguments put forward by the Parties (section A), then considers its jurisdiction under the Founding Agreement (sections B, C, and D) and the Energy Charter Treaty (sections E, F, G, and H), and finally analyses its jurisdiction over Khan's claims of breach of the Foreign Investment Law (section I).\n\n**A. BURDEN OF PROOF**\n----------------------\n\n320.\n\nThe Parties first debate which facts must be proven at the jurisdictional stage of the proceedings.\n\n321.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal finds compelling the reasoning of the *Phoenix* award on jurisdiction, stating that:\n\n[i]t... must look into the role [the] facts play either at the jurisdictional level or at the merits level.... If the alleged facts are facts that, if proven, would constitute a violation of the relevant BIT, they have indeed to be accepted as such at the jurisdictional stage, until their existence is ascertained or not at the merits level. On the contrary, if jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage.461\n\nExhibit CLA-51/RL-71, *Phoenix*, paras. 60-61.\n\n322.\n\nAccordingly, in the Tribunal's view, facts relevant only to the Tribunal's determination on jurisdiction must be proven at the jurisdictional stage. By contrast, facts relevant only to the merits need not be proven at this stage. For the latter facts, it is sufficient that the Claimants make a *prima facie* case, and the Tribunal will take them as true *pro tem* for the purposes of its determination on jurisdiction.462\n\nFor instance, when considering whether particular claims fall within the scope of the relevant arbitration clause(s), the Tribunal will assume the accuracy of the facts on which the claims are based.\n\n323.\n\nDespite the Parties' detailed submissions on this subject, there appears to be no real disagreement between them with regard to these two categories of facts. Both Parties seem to accept the above propositions.463\n\nSee Reply, paras. 14-15, 26; Rejoinder, paras. 8-11.\n\n324.\n\nThe Parties do disagree as to whether facts relevant both to jurisdiction and merits must be proven at this stage of the proceedings.464 In the Tribunal's view, where the determination on jurisdiction depends on facts, these facts must be proven at the jurisdictional stage and cannot be taken *pro tem,* whether or not they will remain relevant for the determination on the merits. This logically follows from the purpose of bifurcation between a jurisdictional and a merits phase, which is to allow for the complete determination of jurisdictional issues during a preliminary phase which may put an end to the proceedings before any need to debate the merits arises and before the costs associated with such debate are incurred by the Parties.\n\nReply, para. 20; Rejoinder, paras. 19-20.\n\n325.\n\nFor example, the facts relied upon by the Respondents to support their objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the ECT on the ground that Khan Netherlands has breached Mongolian law are relevant to both jurisdiction and merits. To support their objection, the Respondents invoke the same alleged legal violations by the Claimants the occurrence of which the Claimants challenge as part of their case on the merits. If the Tribunal were to accept the legal argument supporting the Respondents' objection, it would then have to make a factual determination regarding the alleged legal violations by the Claimants.465\n\nHowever, as explained in section E of its analysis, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondents' argument on the law.\n\n326.\n\nWith regard to all facts that must be proven at this stage of the proceedings in accordance with the principles explained above, the rule, *actori incumbit probatio*, cited by both Parties, applies. Article 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which are the applicable procedural rules in this case, formulates the rule as follows: \"Each party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support its claim or defence.\" The Tribunal applies this proposition where relevant in the analysis below.\n\nB. WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION *RATIONE PERSONAE* OVER KHAN CANADA\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nThe Respondents' first objection to jurisdiction is that the Tribunal cannot assert jurisdiction over Khan Canada because Khan Canada is not a party to the Founding Agreement.\n\n328.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that Khan Canada is not a signatory of the Founding Agreement, the contract containing Article 12, the arbitration clause invoked by the Claimants as the basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Khan Canada. It is also undisputed that Khan Canada has not become a party to the Founding Agreement by operation of any of the classical mechanisms of contract or company law (assignment, agency, subrogation, succession, etc.). The question that divides the Parties and that must be decided by the Tribunal is therefore whether Khan Canada is a party to the arbitration agreement on some other basis.\n\n329.\n\nWhile the Parties have formulated arguments as to applicable law - the Respondents arguing for the application of Mongolian law, and the Claimants, for the application of French law,466 -in the Tribunal's view this point is of secondary importance. The Tribunal considers that the question of whether a non-signatory to a contract is nevertheless a party to the arbitration agreement contained therein requires a factual determination of the common intention of the signatory and non-signatory parties to the contract. The intention of the parties may be inferred from their conduct in connection with the negotiation, performance, and termination of the contract.\n\nThe Respondents argue for the application of Mongolian law, the governing law of the contract pursuant to Article 12.1(i) of the Founding Agreement (Hearing Transcript 32:9-34:6), while the Claimants argue for the application of French law, the law of the seat of arbitration in these proceedings (Rejoinder, paras. 63-66; Hearing Transcript 121:18-122:8). The Claimants also acknowledge that this determination may be made solely on the basis of the facts of the case (Counter-memorial, para. 178; Hearing Transcript 109:1-12).\n\n330.\n\nIn passing, the Tribunal notes that both Parties have indicated that they consider consent to be the basis of contractual relations in both Mongolian and French law.467 The Tribunal is also satisfied that under Mongolian and French law, the parties may manifest their consent not solely by the signature of relevant documents, but also through conduct. The Parties agree that this is the case under French law,468 and Article 43.3 of the Civil Code of Mongolia states as much.469\n\nMemorial, para. 45; Counter-memorial, paras. 178-179; Reply, paras. 66-67; Rejoinder, paras. 69, 72; Hearing Transcript 122:9-14.\n\nMemorial, para. 45; Counter-memorial, paras. 178-179; Reply, paras. 66-67; Rejoinder, paras. 69, 72; Hearing Transcript 122:9-14.\n\nExhibit CLA-117.\n\n331.\n\nThe Respondents insist that Mongolian law does not recognize the so-called \"group of companies doctrine.\" In this respect, the Tribunal observes that the Claimants do not rely on this doctrine.470 The Tribunal further notes that no clear submissions have been made as to the content of any such doctrine. In the Tribunal's view, the mere existence of a group of companies cannot affect the scope of the arbitration clause. As stated above, the relevant inquiry is into the common intention of the Parties, as manifested through their conduct in the negotiation, performance, and termination of the contract.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 82.\n\n332.\n\nIn the present case, it is undisputed that Khan Canada did not participate in the negotiation of the Founding Agreement. In fact, Khan Canada was only incorporated in October 2002, long after the Founding Agreement had been negotiated and executed. It is therefore plain that at the time when Erdene, Priargunsky, and WM Mining executed the Founding Agreement, Khan Canada was not a party thereto.\n\n333.\n\nHowever, on July 2003, Khan Canada acquired the shares of WM Mining (through Khan Bermuda) and thus became the ultimate controlling shareholder in CAUC. While this sole fact does not suffice to make Khan Canada a party to the Founding Agreement, the Tribunal notes that as of that time Khan Canada behaved as if it were replacing CAUC Holding as a party to the Founding Agreement, in particular by performing CAUC Holding's obligations under the Founding Agreement.\n\n334.\n\nAt this juncture, the Tribunal considers it useful to explain that in its view, in order to achieve a complete understanding of the relationship between the Parties, it is necessary to examine not only the Founding Agreement itself, but also the Minerals Agreement. The fact that no claims are asserted under the Minerals Agreement is irrelevant. While a Tribunal may only give effect to an agreement on which its jurisdiction is based, it may, however, take into consideration another agreement (in this case the Minerals Agreement) involving all or some of the same parties for the purpose of interpretation of the first agreement (*i.e.*, the Founding Agreement). The fact that it does not have jurisdiction over all parties to the Minerals Agreement matters not.471\n\nSee eg *Klockner v. Cameroon*, ICSID Annulment Decision of 3 May 1985, Y.B.Com.Arb 162, 1986. See also Hanotiau on Complex Arbitrations, paras. 270 - 271.\n\n335.\n\nThe Minerals Agreement was entered into by Erdene, Priargunsky, and WM Mining three days before they concluded the Founding Agreement. In its introduction, it expresses the parties' desire to form a joint venture for the purpose of developing a uranium extraction project in Dornod (what both Parties refer to in their memorials as the \"Dornod Project\"). As a means of giving life to the proposed joint venture, the Minerals Agreement provides for the establishment of a company through the conclusion of a \"Founding Agreement.\" The Founding Agreement of 6 June 1995 was executed as a result. As the Founding Agreement establishes CAUC, while the purpose of this company is found in part in the Minerals Agreement, these two documents complete one another in portraying the relationship between the parties involved in the Dornod Project. Articles 3.4 and 16.1 of the Founding Agreement further confirm the relevance of the Minerals Agreement.472\n\nArticle 3.4 of the Founding Agreement states that CAUC, \"in all its activities, will be governed by the laws of Mongolia, the Mineral[s] Agreement as well as the provisions of this Agreement and the Charter.\" Article 16.1 of the Founding Agreement reads as follows: \"[The Founding Agreement] and the attachments to it and any supplementary agreements, including the Charter and the Mineral[s] Agreement, represent the entirety of the agreement between the Members.\"\n\n336.\n\nIn accordance with Article 5.4 of the Founding Agreement and Article 2.4 of the Minerals Agreement, the role of WM Mining, CAUC Holding's predecessor in the Founding Agreement, was to raise money and invest it into the joint venture. Under Articles 1.2 and 1.3 of the Minerals Agreement, WM Mining was also expected to conduct and assume the costs of feasibility studies regarding the Dornod Project.\n\n337.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties' submissions provide no indication that WM Mining or CAUC Holding ever acted in performance of these obligations. In fact, it is Khan Canada that raised funds on the Toronto Stock Exchange and commissioned feasibility studies and other reports.473 While the Respondents argue that the Dornod Project never benefited from the money raised, the Tribunal observes that the studies and reports produced by the Claimants are tangible proof that progress was being made on the project. Khan Canada itself, and not any of its subsidiaries, is indicated as the client in all of them. In addition, by all accounts, Khan Canada (through Khan Mongolia) acquired the Exploration License. The other parties to the Founding Agreement recognized that this acquisition would benefit the Dornod Project.474\n\nExhibit C-50, Definitive Feasibility Study (2009), p. 2; Exhibit C-58, NI 43-101 Report (2005), p.1; Exhibit C-59, Scoping Study Report (2006), p.1; Exhibit C-60, Pre-feasibility Study, p.3.\n\nExhibit C-39.\n\n338.\n\nBy ensuring the performance of CAUC Holding's obligations under the Founding Agreement, Khan Canada acted as the \"real party\" to the Founding Agreement.\n\n339.\n\nFurther, the Claimants, in tackling their burden of proof, have successfully demonstrated that the other parties to the Founding Agreement - the SPC, the MRAM, and MonAtom - knew of and accepted Khan Canada's participation in the Dornod Project. CAUC Holding is seldom, if ever, mentioned in the documents relating to CAUC and the Dornod Project produced by the Parties. By contrast, a variety of documents issued by Mongolian state agencies refer to the third shareholder in CAUC or the owner of the Mining License as \"Khan Canada\" or the \"Canadian,\"475 and to CAUC as the \"Mongolian-Russian-Canadian\" joint venture.476 The minutes of a CAUC management committee meeting held on 26 August 2009, and signed by, *inter alia*, MonAtom, are the most compelling acknowledgment of Khan Canada's active role in the performance of the Founding Agreement. These minutes record the fact that Khan Canada completed and even exceeded \"its commitments *as per the original Founding Agreement*.\"477 Similarly, the minutes of the CAUC management committee meeting of 9 November 2009, also signed by MonAtom, recognize the expected benefits of Khan Resources' planned contribution of the Exploration License to the joint venture.478\n\nExhibit C-70, Letter from the SSIA to the Toronto Stock Exchange, p.1; Exhibit C-71, Report of a working group of the State Great Khural (the Mongolian unicameral Parliament) (2010), p.2; Exhibit C-8, Letter from the General Agency for Specialized Inspection of Mongolia (SSIA) to CAUC (2005), p.6.\n\nExhibit C-67, License issued by the SSIA to CAUC (2005); Exhibit C-68, License issued by the SSIA to CAUC (2007).\n\nExhibit C-38 (emphasis added).\n\nExhibit C-39.\n\n340.\n\nThe documents pertaining to the SPC's attempt to sell its shares in CAUC in 2005 are also telling. The SPC issued a resolution on 22 September 2005, stating that the shares would first be offered to Priargunsky and Khan Canada, \"a Canadian company owning 58 % of shares of [CAUC],\" and that, if these \"other shareholders\" refused to buy the shares, these would be sold at a public auction.479 This plan reflects the SPC's attempt to comply with the pre-emption rights accorded to other shareholders under Article 11 of the Founding Agreement in cases of transfer of shares to a third party. Pursuant to the SPC's offer, a memorandum of understanding for the sale of the SPC's shares in CAUC was entered into between the SPC and, notably, Khan Canada itself.480 The fact that the shares were offered to Khan Canada rather than CAUC Holding shows that the SPC considered Khan Canada, and not CAUC Holding, to be the real party to the Founding Agreement.\n\nExhibit C-49.\n\nExhibit C-66.\n\n341.\n\nGiven that Khan Canada performed the obligations of CAUC Holding in the joint venture from the time that it acquired WM Mining, and that MonAtom and its predecessors in the Founding Agreement were aware of, expressly acknowledged and never objected to that fact, the Tribunal finds that Khan Canada, MonAtom, and its predecessors, formed the common intention that Khan Canada become a party to the Founding Agreement and the arbitration agreement contained therein.\n\n342.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over Khan Canada under the Founding Agreement.\n\nC. WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION *RATIONE PERSONAE* OVER MONGOLIA\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nThe Respondents object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Mongolia under the Founding Agreement on the ground that Mongolia is not a party to it. The Claimants, for their part, assert that Mongolia is and has from the start been a party to the Founding Agreement through various representatives, namely, Erdene, the SPC, the MRAM, and, currently, MonAtom.\n\n344.\n\nThe Claimants bear the burden of proving the facts on which they rely in support of this proposition. Having reviewed the evidence produced by both Parties, including the Tsogt Report, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have succeeded in discharging this burden.\n\n345.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the relationship between a state and its alleged representative must be assessed under the law of this state and in light of the factual background of this relationship. As concerns Mongolian law, the Tribunal relies on the Tsogt Report produced by the Claimants. The Respondents did not put forward a Mongolian law expert of their own, and Mr. Tsogt's plausible analysis was unshaken in cross-examination. The Tribunal therefore accepts Mr. Tsogt's opinion that under Mongolian law, and in particular in light of the LSLP, Erdene and MonAtom acted as representatives of Mongolia.481 This assessment coheres with what seems to have been the parties' understanding throughout the life of the Founding Agreement.\n\nTsogt Report, paras. 30-54.\n\n346.\n\nThe fact that the SPC and the MRAM were parties to the Founding Agreement from 2001 to 2009 is uncontested. These entities are by all accounts Mongolian state agencies. As they do not have a legal existence separate from the Government, it is plain that Mongolia was the party to the Founding Agreement under the names \"SPC\" and \"MRAM\" from 2001 to 2009.\n\n347.\n\nErdene and MonAtom, the other two Mongolian entities who have been at one time parties to the Founding Agreement, are, by contrast, limited liability companies. To understand their relationship with Mongolia in the context of the Founding Agreement, it is helpful to start with the texts of both this Agreement and the Minerals Agreement. As explained in section B of the Tribunal's analysis, the latter document provides an essential element of context for understanding the relationship between the parties to the Founding Agreement.\n\n348.\n\nRemarkably, under both the Founding Agreement and the Minerals Agreement, Erdene undertook obligations that only a sovereign state could fulfil. Thus, Article 5.3 of the Founding Agreement provides that the contribution of Erdene to the Charter fund will materialize out of a \"reduction of fees to be paid by [CAUC] for the utilization of natural resources.\" Article 2.2 of the Minerals Agreement phrases the same idea in more general terms: \"The contribution of Erdene consists of the right to utilize mineral deposits.\"\n\n349.\n\nThe Respondents point out that in some provisions of the Minerals Agreement (such as Articles 1.1 and 7.2), it is the \"Ministry of Energy, Geology and Mining of Mongolia\" or the \"government of Mongolia\" that undertakes the sovereign actions of issuing licenses or exempting CAUC from taxes and customs duties. On this basis, the Respondents argue that Erdene and Mongolia are conceptualized as separate entities in the Minerals Agreement. The Tribunal disagrees. Read in context of the entire agreement, the cited provisions appear to provide the detail of Erdene's contribution to the joint venture, expressed succinctly in Article 5.4 of the Founding Agreement. In fact, Article 1.1 of the Minerals Agreement explicitly states that the undertaking was made by the \"Ministry of Energy, Geology and Mining of Mongolia, *represented by* Erdene,\" while Article 13.1 of the Minerals Agreement states that it was made by \"Erdene, *on behalf of* the Ministry of Energy, Geology and Mining Industry of Mongolia.\"482\n\nMinerals Agreement, Arts. 1.1, 13.1.\n\n350.\n\nGiven that Erdene is wholly owned by Mongolia, and that no private party could fulfil Erdene's undertakings under either the Founding Agreement or the Minerals Agreement, it is reasonable to conclude that these undertakings were made on behalf of the Government.\n\n351.\n\nFurther, Articles 12.1 and 12.2 of the Minerals Agreement illustrate an interchangeable use of the words \"Erdene\" and \"Mongolia.\" These provisions read, in relevant part:\n\n12.1 Erdene acknowledges that its equity interest in the Company (33 1/3 %) is its entire interest in the mineral titles covered by this Agreement, except for the royalty as set forth in Paragraph 12.2 herein.\n\n12.2 [CAUC] agrees to pay to Mongolia five percent (5 %) royalty....\n\n352.\n\nThus, while both subparagraphs refer to the same \"royalty,\" the first describes it as payable to Erdene and the second, as payable to Mongolia.\n\n353.\n\nAdditionally, Article 15.1 of the Founding Agreement indicates that all notices addressed to Erdene should be directed to the address of the Mongolian Ministry of Energy, Geology, and Mining. This also suggests some level of identity between Erdene and Mongolia.\n\n354.\n\nTaken together, these provisions show that from the start, Mongolia was a party to the Founding Agreement, albeit through a representative.\n\n355.\n\nThe Claimants have also succeeded in demonstrating that at all subsequent times, from the establishment of CAUC to the commencement of this arbitration, the parties understood that Mongolia was a party to the Founding Agreement. The behaviour of the parties with respect to the transfers of CAUC shares from Erdene to the MRAM in 2001, and from the SPC to MonAtom in 2009, is decisive.\n\n356.\n\nUnder Article 11 of the Founding Agreement, any shareholder wishing to \"assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose\" of its shares in CAUC must give the other shareholders of CAUC a ninety day \"written notice of the price and terms upon which the [d]isposing [shareholder] would be willing to sell such interest,\" giving the other shareholders the opportunity to acquire the shares themselves. No such notice appears to have been provided with respect to the transfers from Erdene to the MRAM (*i.e.,* Mongolia), and from the SPC (*i.e*., Mongolia) to MonAtom.\n\n357.\n\nThe Respondents rely on a letter from the SPC dated June 4, 2009483 to prove that the transfer of shares from the SPC to MonAtom was notified to the other shareholders in accordance with Article 11 of the Founding Agreement. However, this letter was not addressed to the other shareholders, but to MonAtom, and it merely announced post-factum that the CAUC shares \"had been\" transferred to MonAtom. In the Tribunal's view, this letter does not constitute a sufficient notice under Article 11 of the Founding Agreement.\n\nExhibit C-37.\n\n358.\n\nRemarkably, this letter refers to the CAUC shares being transferred as \"the state shares... that allow[\u2026] to implement the right to represent the state.\"484\n\nExhibit C-37.\n\n359.\n\nThe minutes of the shareholder meeting of 26 August 2009 similarly refer to the passage of the management of the state shares from the SPC to MonAtom.485\n\nExhibit C-38.\n\n360.\n\nThe fact that no notice was given pursuant to Article 11 of the Founding Agreement and that accordingly the other shareholders were not given an opportunity to exercise their right of preemption suggests that these transfers of shares were not considered transfers to a third party in the meaning of Article 11.\n\n361.\n\nIn conclusion, the text of the Founding Agreement and the Minerals Agreement, as well as the behaviour of Mongolia, Erdene, the SPC, the MRAM, and MonAtom, demonstrate the understanding of the parties that all the Mongolian entities, including MonAtom, were acting on behalf of the state. The Tsogt Report confirms that this understanding was correct under Mongolian law. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over Mongolia under the Founding Agreement.\n\nD. WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION *RATIONE MATERIAE* OVER THE CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE FOUNDING AGREEMENT\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nHaving found that Khan Canada and Mongolia are both parties to the Founding Agreement and the arbitration agreement contained therein at Article 12, the Tribunal now turns to the question of whether the claims asserted by Khan Canada and CAUC Holding against MonAtom and Mongolia under the Founding Agreement fall within the scope of Article 12.\n\n363.\n\nAt the outset, it is useful to quote both the relevant language of the arbitration agreement and Khan's description of its claims.\n\n364.\n\nArticle 12 of the Founding Agreement provides for arbitration of \"[d]isputes between the parties arising out of, or in connection with, any provisions of this agreement or the interpretation thereof.\"\n\n365.\n\nIn the section of their Notice of Arbitration dedicated to the Founding Agreement, the Claimants state as follows:\n\nIn entering the Founding Agreement, Mongolia also undertook obligations to [the] Claimants in its capacity as the State party to a joint venture designed to develop the State's natural resources. Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement specifically provides that \"Property of the Company [ *i.e.*, CAUC] will not be subject to requisition or confiscation.\" Moreover, Mongolia, as a party to the Founding Agreement (currently through its representative, MonAtom) breached its fiduciary obligations to the joint venture and its partner [CAUC Holding] under Mongolian law. Under Mongolian law, joint venture partners are fiduciaries to one another. Respondents were required to act in good faith and owed a duty to act in the best interests of CAUC. In addition, under Article 82 of the *Company Law* of Mongolia, a duty is imposed upon a \"governing party\" of a company to act in good faith and in the best interests of the company. A \"governing party\" includes any shareholder who holds more than 20% of the shares of a limited liability company and, therefore, includes the Mongolian Government as a 21% shareholder in CAUC. Any governing party who breaches this duty is liable to the company itself and to any shareholder holding more than 1% of the company's shares (such as [CAUC Holding]) for damages caused by the breach. Furthermore, Article 497.1 of the *Civil Code* of Mongolia provides that a person or company is liable where it has caused damage to another person's rights, life, health, dignity, business reputation or property deliberately or due to negligent action.486\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 71-72.\n\n366.\n\nIn their Counter-memorial, the Claimants allege that Mongolia, \"as a party to the Founding Agreement,\" has breached its obligation under international law to treat foreign investors in accordance with certain minimum standards, which include \"non-expropriation without compensation, non-arbitrariness and non-abuse of discretion.\"487\n\nCounter-memorial, paras. 249, 254.\n\n367.\n\nThe Claimants further state that the following facts underlie their claims:\n\nSpecifically, Respondent's acts and omissions breaching these obligations include (but are not limited to): the illegal invalidation of the [M]ining and [E]xploration [L]icenses; the passage of the [NEL] that provides, *inter alia,* for the taking of the ownership interest in CAUC and Khan Mongolia without compensation; Mongolia's refusal to re-register the licenses under the NEL pursuant to the 9 November 2009 Re-registration Applications; making unfounded public statements alleging that the Claimants were in breach of Mongolian law; and, the repeated actions intended to undermine [the] Claimants' reputation in Mongolia and abroad.488\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 74.\n\n368.\n\nWhile the Respondents focus much of their argument on the absence of an appropriate legal foundation to Khan's claims, the Tribunal considers that at this stage of the proceedings, it can proceed on the assumption that Khan's claims are valid in law.\n\n369.\n\nFurthermore, in the Tribunal's view, the Claimants have made out a *prima facie* case with respect to the facts on which their claims depend. Therefore, in analyzing its *ratione materiae* jurisdiction, the Tribunal takes the Claimants' factual allegations concerning the merits as true *pro tem.*\n\n370.\n\nTherefore, the only relevant question at this point is whether Khan's claims fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement - *i.e.*, whether for each of these claims the dispute \"arises out of, or in connection with, the provisions of the [Founding Agreement] or the interpretation thereof.\"\n\n371.\n\nThe Respondents divide Khan's claims into three categories: (i) expropriation claims, (ii) breach of fiduciary duty claims, and (iii) claims under international law. The Tribunal addresses each category in turn.\n\n*(i) Expropriation claims*\n--------------------------\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, contrary to the Respondents' depiction, the Claimants do not make any broad \"expropriation claims\" under the Founding Agreement. Rather, the Claimants specifically allege that Mongolia has breached Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement.489 While the Parties extensively debate whether Article 3.6 constitutes an expropriation clause similar to those typically found in investment treaties, this is a matter of interpretation of Article 3.6 to be resolved at the merits stage. At present, it is sufficient for the Tribunal to observe that a dispute exists between the Parties concerning the interpretation and application of Article 3.6 and that, as a dispute arising out of the interpretation of a provision of the Founding Agreement, it falls squarely within the scope of the arbitration agreement.\n\nSee Notice of Arbitration, para. 71; Counter-memorial, para. 243; Rejoinder, paras. 112-113.\n\n*(ii) Breach of fiduciary duty claim*\n-------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Khan's breach of fiduciary duty claim is based on various provisions of Mongolian law rather than on a specific provision of the Founding Agreement. The question is therefore whether any fiduciary duties that the Respondents may have toward Khan Canada and CAUC Holding under Mongolian law are sufficiently connected to the Founding Agreement to fall within the scope of the language of Article 12. The Tribunal considers that they are.\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal understands the words \"in connection with\" in Article 12 of the Founding Agreement to be quite broad. They encompass more than only claims of breach of the Founding Agreement.\n\n375.\n\nAs described in section B of the Tribunal's analysis, the introduction to the Minerals Agreement expresses the \"desire\" of the founders of CAUC (WM Mining, Erdene, and Priargunsky) \"to establish a joint business venture pursuant to Mongolian law in order to mine and process uranium ore as well as other minerals... in the area of the Dornod deposit in northeastern Mongolia.\" Article 3.1 of the Minerals Agreement specifies that the founders of CAUC \"shall conduct the business of the venture as a company with limited liability under the laws of Mongolia... and shall form the Company by entering into the Founding Agreement.\" It is apparent on this basis that CAUC Holding was established by the Founding Agreement for the purpose of the pursuit of the joint venture described in the Minerals Agreement.\n\n376.\n\nThe fiduciary duties invoked by the Claimants arise precisely out of the relationship between Khan Canada, CAUC Holding, Mongolia, and MonAtom as partners in the joint venture for the pursuit of which CAUC was created through the Founding Agreement. The Claimants base their breach of fiduciary duty claims in great part on the allegation that Mongolia revoked and refused to re-issue the Mining and Exploration Licenses in order to be able to pursue the Dornod Project without the participation of the Claimants, *i.e.*, to avoid having to comply with its obligations under the Founding Agreement and the Minerals Agreement to pursue a joint venture with CAUC Holding and Khan Canada.\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the breach of fiduciary duty claims arise \"in connection with\" the provisions of the Founding Agreement and therefore fall within the scope of Article 12.\n\n*(iii) Claims under international law*\n--------------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal finds that since Khan Canada's and CAUC Holding's breach of international law claims are based on Mongolia's alleged attempts to avoid participating in the joint venture set up under the Founding Agreement, these claims are sufficiently connected to the provisions of the Founding Agreement to fall within the scope of Article 12.\n\n379.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal finds that it has *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over all the above claims made by Khan Canada and CAUC Holding under the Founding Agreement.\n\nE. WHETHER KHAN NETHERLANDS IS PREVENTED FROM BRINGING ECT CLAIMS DUE TO ITS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH MONGOLIAN LAW\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nThe Respondents object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Khan Netherlands under the ECT on the ground that Khan Netherlands has violated Mongolian law in the course of its investment. In support of their objection, the Respondents argue that an investor who has violated the laws of the host state is not entitled to the substantive protections of the ECT regardless of whether such violations \"occurred before or after the initial investment was made.\"490\n\nMemorial, para. 124; Reply, para. 153.\n\n381.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with this proposition.\n\n382.\n\nThe awards cited by the Respondents in support of their assertion merely state the rule that the protections of an investment treaty such as the ECT cannot be extended to an investment *made* illegally.491\n\nIn the *Plama* Award on the Merits, the tribunal found that \"the substantive protections of the ECT cannot apply to investments *made* contrary to law\" (Exhibit CLA-50, para. 139) (emphasis added). Similarly, in *Phoenix*, the tribunal stated that \"... States cannot be deemed to offer access to the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investments *made* in violation of their laws\" (Exhibit CLA-51/RL-17, para. 101) (emphasis added). In *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award of 2 August 2006, the claimant was denied the protection of the BIT because it had acted improperly \"in order to be awarded the bid that made its investment possible\" (para. 243). In *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award of 16 August 2007, this point was addressed in some detail in *obiter* : \"Although this contention is not relevant to the analysis of the problem which the Tribunal has before it, namely the *entry* of the investment and not the way it was subsequently conducted, the Tribunal would note that this part of the Respondent's interpretation appears to be a forced construction of the pertinent provisions in the context of the entire Treaty. The language of both Articles 1 and 2 of the BIT emphasizes the *initiation* of the investment. Moreover the effective operation of the BIT regime would appear to require that jurisdictional compliance be limited to the initiation of the investment. If, at the time of the initiation of the investment, there has been compliance with the law of the host state, allegations by the host state of violations of its law in the course of the investment, as a justification for state action with respect to the investment, might be a defense to claimed *substantive* violations of the BIT, but could not deprive a tribunal acting under the authority of the BIT of its jurisdiction\" (para. 345) (emphasis in the original).\n\n383.\n\nThis is logical. An investor who has obtained its investment in the host state only by acting in bad faith or in violation of the laws of the host state, has brought him or herself within the scope of application of the ECT only as a result of his wrongful acts. Such an investor should not be allowed to benefit as a result, in accordance with the maxim *nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans.*\n\n384.\n\nHowever, there is no compelling reason to altogether deny the right to invoke the ECT to any investor who has breached the law of the host state in the course of its investment. The ECT contains no provision to this effect. If the investor acts illegally, the host state can impose upon it sanctions available under local law, as Mongolia indeed purports to have done by invalidating and refusing to re-register the Exploration License. However, if the investor believes these sanctions to be unjustified, it must have the possibility of challenging their validity. It would undermine the purpose and object of the Treaty to deny the investor the right to make its case before an arbitral tribunal based on the same alleged violations the existence of which the investor seeks to dispute on the merits.\n\n385.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondents' objection to jurisdiction and defers the question of whether Khan Netherlands has breached Mongolian law to the merits.\n\nF. WHETHER KHAN NETHERLANDS IS PREVENTED FROM BRINGING ECT CLAIMS BY OPERATION OF ARTICLE 26(3)(B)(I) OF THE ECT\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n386.\n\nThe Respondents object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the ECT on the ground that Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT, the Treaty's fork in the road provision, was triggered by the claims initiated by Khan Mongolia and CAUC in April 2010 before the Administrative Court.\n\n387.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mongolia is listed in Annex ID of the Treaty as one of the states which, in accordance with Article 26(b)(i) of the ECT, have restricted their unconditional consent to the submission of disputes to international arbitration to those disputes that have not been previously submitted to the \"courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party.\"492\n\nTreaty, Art. 26(2)(a).\n\n388.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore determine whether the dispute submitted to arbitration before it is the same dispute that was submitted to the Administrative Court in the proceedings indicated by the Respondents.\n\n389.\n\nAt the hearing on jurisdiction, the Respondents admitted that their objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction would fail if the Tribunal were to apply the so-called \"triple identity\" test to compare the local and international proceedings.493 The Respondents therefore argued for the application of what they identified as the \"fundamental basis\" test.\n\nHearing Transcript 65:12-66:4.\n\n390.\n\nHowever, in the present case, the Tribunal sees no reason to go beyond the triple identity test. There is ample authority for its application.494\n\nExhibit CLA-58, *Lauder v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Final Award of 3 September 2001, paras. 163-66; Exhibit CLA-59, *CMS v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 17 July 2003, para. 80; Exhibit CLA-60, *Azurix v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 December 2003, paras. 88-91; Exhibit CLA-61, *Pan American Energy LLC et al. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/8, Decision on preliminary Objections of 27 July 2006, paras. 154-157; Exhibit C-62, *Toto Costruzioni Generali SpA v. Lebanon*, ICSIC Case No ARB/07/12, Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 September 2009, paras. 211-212.\n\n391.\n\nThe Respondents principally argue that the triple identity test strips the fork in the road provision of any practical effect, presumably because it is unrealistic to expect all three prongs of the test to be satisfied. It must first be replied that the test for the application of fork in the road provisions should not be too easy to satisfy, as this could have a chilling effect on the submission of disputes by investors to domestic fora, even when the issues at stake are clearly within the domain of local law. This may cause claims being brought to international arbitration before they are ripe on the merits, simply because the investor is afraid that by submitting the existing dispute to local courts or tribunals, it will forgo its right to later make any claims related to the same investment before an international arbitral tribunal.\n\n392.\n\nThe Respondents' argument that the test is too strict may have some persuasive force in cases where only one of the requirements of the triple identity test is not satisfied, while the remaining requirements, as well as other aspects of the two disputes are identical. But this is not the case here. The Respondents identify the three criteria of the triple identity test as being parties, cause, and object. Not one of these criteria is satisfied in the present case.\n\n393.\n\nFirst, the parties to both disputes are different. The proceedings before the Administrative Court were initiated by Khan Mongolia and CAUC, while the only claimant asserting ECT claims before the Tribunal is Khan Netherlands.495\n\nCompare Exhibits C-13/R-26 and R-25, and the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n394.\n\nSecond, the causes of action of both disputes are different. Before the Administrative Court, Khan Mongolia and CAUC challenged the NEA's invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses on the grounds that the NEA had violated procedural requirements of various Mongolian laws and regulations. The Administrative Court decided on this basis.496 Before this Tribunal, Khan argues its case on the basis of breach of the ECT. Such claims could not have been submitted for decision by the Administrative Court.\n\nExhibit C-13/R-26; Exhibit R-25.\n\n395.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the objects of the local and international proceedings differ. CAUC and Khan Mongolia asked the Administrative Court to quash the NEA's administrative decision to invalidate the Mining and Exploration Licenses.497 By contrast, in these proceedings, Khan Netherlands is seeking compensation for the alleged loss of its investment. In light of Mr. Tsogt's unhesitating testimony at the hearing, the Tribunal considers that this goal could not have been achieved through the proceedings before the Administrative Court, as that Court does not have the power to grant damages.498\n\nExhibit C-13/R-26; Exhibit R-25.\n\nHearing Transcript 204: 7-21.\n\n396.\n\nThis is therefore not a case where the investor seeks to try its luck a second time to obtain what it wants in relation to the same dispute but before a different forum.\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that CAUC's claim before the Administrative Court was concerned with the allegedly invalid invalidation of the Mining License, an action of Mongolia that Khan Netherlands does not contest under the ECT. The Tribunal also notes that Khan Mongolia, for its part, challenged only one of the actions of Mongolia (invalidation of the Exploration License) that form the basis of Khan Netherlands' claims in this arbitration.499\n\nSee Notice of Arbitration, para. 74.\n\n398.\n\nThe Respondents also invoke the following part of Mongolia's written statement of policies, practices, and conditions made in accordance with Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the ECT:\n\nDisputes resolved by Courts of Mongolia can not be resubmitted to the International Courts as national courts have already given a final judgment and that will contradict the Constitution of Mongolia and has a risk of having two judgments on the same dispute. Therefore, policies, practices and conditions of Mongolia do not allow an investor to resubmit the same dispute to International arbitration.500\n\nExhibit RL-28.\n\n399.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see how this statement lends support to the Respondents' objection, as it contains no additional guidance as to what constitutes the \"same dispute\" under the ECT or as a matter of policy or practice in Mongolia.\n\n400.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the fork in the road provision of the ECT has not been triggered.\n\nG. WHETHER KHAN NETHERLANDS HAS COMPLIED WITH THE WAITING PERIOD REQUIREMENT OF ARTICLE 26(2) OF THE ECT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n401.\n\nThe Respondents object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the ground that Khan Netherlands has not respected the amicable dispute settlement requirements of Articles 26(1) and 26(2) of the ECT.\n\n402.\n\nArticle 26(1) provides that disputes under the Treaty \"shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\" Article 26(2) further provides that if such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph 1, *i.e.*, amicably, \"within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement,\" the investor may submit its dispute to international arbitration.\n\n403.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Khan Netherlands has complied with the requirement to attempt amicable resolution of the present dispute by the Letter to the Prime Minister, sent on 15 April 2010, almost nine months before the commencement of this arbitration, and by the subsequent negotiation attempts made by senior officers of Khan Canada and Khan Netherlands during meetings with representatives of MonAtom and Mongolia.\n\n404.\n\nThe Tribunal adopts a broad understanding of what constitutes sufficient notice to trigger the three month waiting period of Article 26(2) of the Treaty, as the ECT does not contain any explicit formal requirements for such purpose. Article 26(1) aims at encouraging good faith negotiations between parties, without unduly limiting the recourse to arbitration. Thus, in making the amicable settlement request referred to at Article 26(2) of the ECT, the investor need only (i) describe the dispute in a manner sufficient to enable the other party to understand what is being referred to, and (ii) manifest the desire to seek an amicable resolution.\n\n405.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the views of the tribunal in *Amto*, which stated:\n\nA party can request amicable settlement of a dispute without identifying any ECT claims, and an Investor may have good reason not to formulate claims at this stage, in order to avoid taking a position or appearing to threaten the State party with arbitration before bona fide settlement discussions. The purpose of Article 26(2) \u2014to provide for settlement discussions\u2014 requires the avoidance of legal forms, and the facilitation of open communication. The Investor must inform the State of the state of affairs involving disagreement, and request amicable settlement. If the State considers there is insufficient information to initiate discussions then the good faith response is simply to so advise the Investor, and require more detail. In other words, to initiate the type of communications envisaged by Article 26(2).501\n\nExhibit CLA-64/RL-20, *Amto*, para. 57.\n\n406.\n\nIn the present case, the Letter to the Prime Minister described the history of the dispute at length and in much the same way as it is described in the Notice of Arbitration by which these proceedings were commenced. This description was more than sufficient to allow Mongolia to understand what the dispute was about, and, in the words of the *Amto* tribunal, to \"investigate and take steps to resolve the dispute.\"502 Contrary to the Respondents' assessment, the Tribunal considers that the tone of the letter is neither \"aggressive\" nor \"threatening.\" In fact, the Letter to the Prime Minister contains language expressing the Claimants' willingness to discuss the issues raised by the letter, as well as an offer by Mr. Quick to travel to Mongolia to meet the Prime Minister in person.503\n\nReply, paras. 169-170, quoting Exhibit CLA-64/RL-20, *Amto*, para. 50.\n\nExhibit C-15, p. 5.\n\n407.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the Letter to the Prime Minister did not constitute sufficient notice to trigger the three month waiting period of Article 26(2) because it was sent on the letterhead of Khan Canada, signed by Mr. Quick, Khan Canada's CEO, and did not explicitly mention Khan Netherlands, although it mentioned both Khan Canada, its parent company, and Khan Mongolia, its direct subsidiary.504 However, the Tribunal considers that it was reasonable for Khan Canada, the ultimate shareholder of CAUC and the parent of both CAUC Holding and Khan Mongolia, to write to the Prime Minister of Mongolia with respect to a dispute that concerned both the Mining and Exploration Licenses. Khan Canada was the only party with an interest in both licenses at once, and also the only party with the authority to reach an amicable settlement on behalf of all the others. Had Mongolia been able to reach agreement with Khan Canada with regard to the grievances expressed in the Letter to the Prime Minister, it would also have eliminated the grounds for Khan Netherlands' claims in this arbitration.\n\nReply, paras. 180-182.\n\n408.\n\nIn addition, in the Tribunal's view, the Respondents' claim that the Claimants attempted to hide the existence of Khan Netherlands is not borne out by the evidence.505\n\nSee Exhibit C-4, Appendix D; Exhibit C-78.\n\n409.\n\nGiven that the Tribunal finds that Khan Netherlands has met the attempt at amicable settlement requirement of Article 26, it becomes unnecessary to address the Parties' arguments concerning the jurisdictional or procedural nature of this requirement. Nor does the Tribunal need to decide whether the requirement extends only to situations where amicable dispute settlement is \"possible,\" as asserted by the Claimants.\n\nH. WHETHER KHAN NETHERLANDS' CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY OPERATION OF ARTICLE 17(1) OF THE ECT\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Respondents' argument that the benefits of Part III of the ECT are denied to Khan Netherlands by operation of Article 17(1), the denial of benefits clause of the Treaty.\n\n411.\n\nAt the outset, it must be stated that in the Tribunal's view, the Respondent's argument cannot affect the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Khan Netherlands' claims under the ECT. The introductory section of Article 17 of the ECT specifies that it concerns the denial of advantages of \"*this Part,*\" that is, Part III of the Treaty, which is titled \"Investment Promotion and Protection\" and sets forth the substantive protections that each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of other contracting parties. Article 26 of the ECT, on which the Claimants rely to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction, is found in Part V, which is dedicated to \"Dispute Settlement.\" Thus, on a reading of the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 17, this provision can operate to deny Khan Netherlands the benefit of the substantive protections it would otherwise be entitled to under the Treaty, but not to deny it the advantage of arbitrating its dispute with the Respondents before this Tribunal. The question of the application of Article 17 is therefore one for the merits, not jurisdiction.\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal's views on this point concord with those of the tribunals in *Yukos* and *Plama*.506\n\nExhibit RL-22, *Plama*, paras. 146-151; Exhibit RL-24, *Yukos*, para. 441.\n\n413.\n\nNevertheless, as the Parties have agreed to treat the question of the application or nonapplication of Article 17(1) as a preliminary question,507 and have extensively briefed the Tribunal thereon, and as a finding that Article 17(1) applies in the present case may spare the Parties the cost and effort of making further voluminous submissions concerning the merits of Khan Netherlands' claims under the Treaty, the Tribunal will render a definitive decision on this question in this award.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 364, referring to Claimants' Response Memorial on Bifurcation, para. 44; Hearing Transcript 187:4-12.\n\n414.\n\nThe relevant section of Article 17 is reproduced for ease of reference:\n\nArticle 17  \nNon-Application of Part III in Certain Circumstances\n\nEach Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part to:\n\n(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized...\n\n415.\n\nThe Claimants have conceded that the substantive conditions of Article 17(1) of the ECT - that the legal entity invoking the protections of the ECT be owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a third state and that such legal entity have no substantial business activities in the place in which it is organized - are met in the present case. It is uncontested that Khan Netherlands is owned and controlled by Khan Canada, an entity incorporated in Canada, which is a \"third state\" for purposes of Article 17(1), and that Khan Canada has no substantial business activities in the Netherlands, the \"Contracting Party\" in which it is organized. Hence, Khan Netherlands is the kind of entity to which Article 17(1) could apply.\n\n416.\n\nHowever, the Parties disagree as to whether Article 17(1) applies to Khan Netherlands in the present case. This is a matter of interpretation of the provision. The Respondents appear to put forward, without clearly distinguishing between them, two interpretations of Article 17(1). On the one hand, the Respondents contend that Article 17(1) operates as an automatic denial of benefits by all Contracting Parties to all legal entities that satisfy the substantive conditions of paragraph 1 of this Article.508 On the other hand, the Respondents seem to argue that under Article 17(1), a Contracting Party may at any time, including after the commencement of the arbitral proceedings, deny the benefits of Part III of the Treaty to a legal entity that satisfies the provision's criteria.509 It is plain that these two interpretations of Article 17(1) are mutually exclusive and the Tribunal will address each in turn in the following, as if they had been presented as alternative arguments.\n\nReply, para. 261; Hearing Transcript 74:17-75:9.\n\nMemorial, paras. 194, 235; see also Reply, para. 279: \"Mongolia avails itself of its right under Article 17(1) to deny the advantages of Part III to Khan Netherlands in this case.\"\n\n*(i) Does Article 17(1) of the ECT constitute an automatic denial of benefits?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nThe ECT is an international treaty. Its interpretation is governed by the rules of international law expressed in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. Both Parties have made arguments on this basis. The Parties have also extensively referred to arbitral decisions that have previously considered the interpretation of Article 17 of the ECT. While the Tribunal does not believe that it is bound to follow the precedent of any prior relevant arbitral decisions, the Tribunal considers that it has a duty to take account of these decisions, in the hope of contributing to the formation of a consistent interpretation of the ECT capable of enhancing the ability of investors to predict the investment protections which they can expect to benefit from under the Treaty.\n\n418.\n\nIn accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT, the Tribunal seeks to interpret Article 17(1) \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n419.\n\nArticle 17(1) of the ECT provides that the Contracting Party \"reserves the right\" to deny the benefits of Part III of the ECT. The ordinary meaning of the verb \"to reserve\" suggests that the right to deny the benefits of the Treaty is being *kept* by the Contracting Party, to be exercised in the future.510 Had Article 17 been intended to deny benefits automatically, it could easily have been phrased to do so. A formulation such as: \"The advantages of Part III of the ECT shall be denied to\" would have made such meaning plain. This leads the Tribunal to conclude that the Contracting Party's right to deny the benefits of Part III of the ECT must be exercised actively.\n\nExhibit CLA-129, Macmillan English Dictionary, Definition of the phrase \"reserve the right to do something\": \"to keep the right to do something if you later think it necessary.\"\n\n420.\n\nArticle 1(7) of the ECT contains a broad definition of what counts as an \"Investor\" for purposes of the Treaty. If Article 17(1) were to provide for an automatic denial of benefits, it would effectively create an exception to this broad definition. Such exception would more logically be found within the definition at Article 1(7) itself.\n\n421.\n\nThe interpretation that Article 17 requires an active exercise of the Contracting Party's right to deny the benefits of Part III of the ECT is in line with the Treaty's object and purpose. Article 2 of the ECT describes its purpose to establish \"a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits.\" The provision of an option to deny the benefits of Part III of the ECT furthers this goal of \"longterm cooperation,\" as it creates an incentive to join the Treaty for states with a variety of policies with respect to legal entities that fall within the definition of Article 17(1). Thus, both states that wish to attract the investment of such legal entities, and those that do not wish to extend investment protections to such entities, are encouraged to become Contracting Parties. The expression \"mutual benefits\" of Article 2 of the ECT refers to the receipt of a benefit by each Contracting Party, but does not imply that such benefits must be coextensive.\n\n422.\n\nBoth the *Plama* and *Yukos* tribunals, faced with precisely the same question of whether the Contracting Party must actively exercise its right under Article 17(1) of the ECT, answered in the affirmative.\n\n423.\n\nConcerning the manner in which the host state's right may be exercised, the Tribunal concurs with the *Plama* tribunal in that:\n\n[t]he exercise [of the Contracting State's right to deny benefits under Article 17(1) of the ECT] would necessarily be associated with publicity or other notice so as to become reasonably available to investors and their advisers. To this end, a general declaration in a Contracting State's official gazette could suffice; or a statutory provision in a Contracting State's investment or other laws; or even an exchange of letters with a particular investor or class of investors. Given that in practice an investor must distinguish between Contracting States with different state practices, it is not unreasonable or impractical to interpret Article 17(1) as requiring that a Contracting State must exercise its right before applying it to an investor and be seen to have done so.511\n\nExhibit RL-22, *Plama*, para. 157.\n\n424.\n\nOnce it is found that the Article 17(1) right must be actively exercised, the question arises of whether in the present case Mongolia has in fact exercised its right. While Mongolia does not clearly point to a moment when it exercised its right to deny the benefits of Part III of the Treaty to Khan Netherlands, the Tribunal accepts the implication of Mongolia's argument that in raising this objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, Mongolia is in fact exercising its right under Article 17(1). The question then remains of whether the Article 17(1) right may be effectively exercised toward a particular investor after the investor in question commences international arbitration against the host state.\n\n*(ii) Whether the Contracting Party's right to deny benefits under Article 17 of the ECT may be exercised after commencement of the arbitration*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n425.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this question of interpretation is not solved by reference to the terms of Article 17(1). It is therefore necessary to investigate with particular attention the \"object and purpose\" of the Treaty.\n\n426.\n\nThe Treaty seeks to create a predictable legal framework for investments in the energy field. This predictability materializes only if investors can know in advance whether they are entitled to the protections of the Treaty. If an investor such as Khan Netherlands, who falls within the definition of \"Investor\" at Article 1(7) of the Treaty and is therefore entitled to the Treaty's protections in principle, could be denied the benefit of the Treaty at any moment after it has invested in the host country, it would find itself in a highly unpredictable situation. This lack of certainty would impede the investor's ability to evaluate whether or not to make an investment in any particular state. This would be contrary to the Treaty's object and purpose.\n\n427.\n\nIn contrast, an obligation for contracting parties to exercise their Article 17 right in time to give adequate notice to investors would be consistent with the obligation of host states under Article 10(1) of the Treaty to create \"transparent conditions\" for investments.\n\n428.\n\nIn this respect the *Plama* tribunal stated as follows:\n\nThe covered investor enjoys the advantages of Part III unless the host state exercises its right under Article 17(1) ECT; and a putative covered investor has legitimate expectations of such advantages until that right's exercise. A putative investor therefore requires reasonable notice before making any investment in the host state whether or not that host state has exercised its rights under Article 17(1) ECT. At that stage, the putative investor can so plan its business affairs to come within or without the criteria there specified, as it chooses. It can also plan not to make any investment at all or to make it elsewhere. After an investment is made in the host state the \"hostage-factor\" is introduced; the covered investor's choices are accordingly more limited; and the investor is correspondingly more vulnerable to the host state's exercise of its right under Article 17(1) ECT. At this time, therefore, the covered investor needs at least the same protection as it enjoyed as a putative investor able to plan its investment. The ECT's express \"purpose\" under Article 2 ECT is.... It is difficult to see how any retrospective effect is consistent with this \"long-term\" purpose.512\n\nExhibit RL-22, *Plama*, para. 161.\n\n429.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine that any Contracting Party, whatever its general policy regarding mailbox companies, would refrain from exercising its right to deny the substantive protections of the ECT to an investor who has already commenced arbitration and is claiming a substantial sum of money. A good faith interpretation does not permit the Tribunal to choose a construction of Article 17 that would allow host states to lure investors by ostensibly extending to them the protections of the ECT, to then deny these protections when the investor attempts to invoke them in international arbitration.\n\n430.\n\nThe Respondents invoke the *Petrobart* and *Amto* decisions to assert that there is no settled interpretation of Article 17(1).513 However, in the Tribunal's view, *Petrobart* and *Amto* do not conflict with its interpretation of this provision. The *Amto* tribunal considered that Article 17(1) requires the active exercise of the Contracting Party's right, stating, among other, that the investor falling within the definition of Article 17(1) has \"a *defeasible right* to investment protection under the ECT, because the host State of the investment has *the power to divest*\" the investor of his right and referring to the \"potential\" exclusion of the investor from ECT investment protection.514 The *Amto* tribunal then found it unnecessary to address the question of when the Contracting Party must exercise its Article 17 right, as in any event the claimant in that case did not satisfy the substantive criteria of Article 17(1). For the same reason, the *Petrobart* tribunal did not address the question of interpretation of Article 17(1).515\n\nMemorial, paras. 199-200, 205-112.\n\nExhibit CLA-64/RL-20, *Amto*, para. 61 (emphasis added).\n\nExhibit CLA-101/RL-23, *Petrobart*, paras. 344-348.\n\n431.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal finds that Article 17(1) of the ECT does not operate in the present case to bar Khan Netherlands from invoking the protections of the ECT.\n\nI. THE TRIBUNAL'S JURISDICTION OVER THE CLAIMANTS' CLAIMS UNDER THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n432.\n\nThe only question left for determination by the Tribunal is whether it has jurisdiction over Khan's claim that the Respondents have breached the Foreign Investment Law.\n\n433.\n\nArticle 25 of the Foreign Investment Law provides:\n\nSettlement of Disputes\n\nDisputes between foreign investors and Mongolian investors as well as between foreign investors and Mongolian legal or natural persons on the matters relating to foreign investment and the operations of the foreign invested business entity shall be resolved in the Courts of Mongolia unless provided otherwise by international treaties to which Mongolia is a party or by any contract between the parties.\n\n434.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Respondents incorrectly emphasize this provision's reference to the courts of Mongolia. Article 25 does not preclude the submission of breach of the Foreign Investment Law claims to international arbitration. On the contrary, Article 25 authorizes the resolution of disputes concerning foreign investment in international arbitration where a relevant treaty or contract provides for this method of dispute resolution.\n\n435.\n\nHowever, Article 25 does not constitute an independent basis for a recourse to arbitration. Rather, it refers to relevant treaties and contracts. Accordingly, in order for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over Khan's claims of breach of provisions of the Foreign Investment Law, these claims must fall within the scope of the relevant arbitration clauses, namely, Article 12 of the Founding Agreement and Article 26 of the ECT.\n\n436.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Khan Canada's and CAUC Holding's Foreign Investment Law claims fall within the broad scope of Article 12 of the Founding Agreement, as they, like the breach of fiduciary duty and international obligations claims discussed in section D(ii) and (iii) of the Tribunal's analysis, arise out the relationship between the Parties defined by the Founding Agreement.\n\n437.\n\nPhrased less broadly than Article 12 of the Founding Agreement, Article 26 of the ECT provides only for the resolution of disputes that \"concern an alleged breach of an obligation of [a Contracting Party] under Part III\" of the ECT. This formulation cannot encompass disputes arising out of the breach of other legal instruments, such as the Foreign Investment Law. The Claimants, however, invoke Article 10(1) of the ECT to bring Khan Netherlands' Foreign Investment Law claims within the scope of Article 26 of the ECT. The last sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT, the Treaty's so-called \"umbrella\" provision, reads as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.\n\n438.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the terms \"any obligations\" encompass the statutory obligations of the host state and in this case, Mongolia's obligations under the Foreign Investment Law.516 Given the ordinary meaning of the term \"any\" and the fact that the Respondents have not submitted any arguments or authorities to the contrary, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants' interpretation of Article 10(1) of the ECT. It follows that a breach by Mongolia of any obligations it may have under the Foreign Investment Law would constitute a breach of the provisions of Part III of the Treaty. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction under the ECT over Khan Netherlands' Foreign Investment Law claims.\n\nCounter-memorial, para. 446, n. 564.\n\n**VIII.

By letter of the next day, the Claimants objected to the Respondents' request and indicated that, should the Tribunal allow Mr. Mays to testify, the Claimants would want to file six new factual exhibits. The Respondents replied by letter dated 28 October 2013, re-iterating their application regarding Mr. Mays and objecting to the filing of the new exhibits.\n\n28.\n\nA pre-hearing conference call was held on 31 October 2013 between the Parties and the Presiding Arbitrator. A complete transcript of the call and minutes summarizing key points were circulated to the Parties and the Tribunal.\n\n29.\n\nOn 8 November 2013, following a letter from the Respondents on 4 November 2013 and an email response by the Claimants on the same date, the Tribunal refused the Respondents' application for Mr. Mays to be called at the hearing and said that it would destroy the six documents that it had been provided with by the Claimants in connection thereof.\n\n30.\n\nOn the same date, at the request of the Presiding Arbitrator, the Parties submitted an updated hearing schedule agreed between them.\n\n31.\n\nThe hearing on merits and quantum was held at the ICC Hearing Center in Paris from 11 to 15 November 2013.

POST-HEARING PROCEEDINGS**\n-------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nOn 9 December 2013, after having first circulated a draft to the Parties for their consideration, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, providing, *inter alia*, a timetable for the filing of two rounds of short post-hearing submissions, submissions on costs and the joint submission by the Parties of an agreed chronology of main events and facts.\n\n34.\n\nOn 20 December 2013, the Parties, unable to agree upon a single chronology of main events and facts, submitted separate versions to the Tribunal.\n\n35.\n\nOn 31 December 2013, after having conferred, the Parties each submitted their respective changes to the transcript that had been agreed by the other Party.\n\n36.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 5, on 5 February 2014, the Parties each filed a first posthearing brief (\"**Claimants' First Post-Hearing Brief**\" and \"**Respondents' First Post-Hearing Brief**\").\n\n37.\n\nBy letter dated 27 February 2014, the Claimants requested permission from the Tribunal to submit an attachment to their second post-hearing submission to address what they alleged to be improper citations in the Respondents' First Post-Hearing Brief. The Respondents objected to this request by letter dated 5 March 2014.\n\n38.\n\nBy letter from the PCA dated 11 March 2014, the Tribunal granted the Claimants' request, specifying that each Party would be allowed to file an attachment to their second post-hearing submission to briefly address any alleged improper citations or misstatements in the other Party's First Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n39.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 5, on 11 April 2014, the Parties each filed a second posthearing brief (\"**Claimants' Second Post-Hearing Brief**\" and \"**Respondents' Second PostHearing Brief**\") and a costs submission (\"**Claimants' Submission on Costs**\" and \"**Respondents' Submission on Costs**\"). In addition, the Claimants filed a Table of Respondents' Improper Citations.\n\n40.\n\nOn 15 April 2014, the Respondents submitted a letter disputing the reasonableness of the Claimants' reported costs.\n\n41.\n\nOn 8 May 2014, after having been invited by the Tribunal to do so, the Claimants responded to the Respondents' letter of 15 April 2014, dismissing it as \"frivolous and unsupported,\" and maintaining their submission that the Respondents should bear the \"full and reasonable costs\" of this arbitration. The Respondents submitted a letter in response the next day (on 9 May 2014), requesting that the Tribunal order the Claimants \"to disclose the fee arrangement between the Claimants and their Counsel in its entirety,\" including details concerning its claimed \"success fee.\"\n\n42.\n\nOn 15 May 2014, the Presiding Arbitrator notified the Parties that, \"should the Tribunal decide to make a costs award in favour of the Claimants, the Tribunal would require a full understanding of the success fee arrangement,\" and he directed the Claimants to \"provide either (i) the success fee arrangement or (ii) correspondence relating to the success fee that evidences the terms of the agreement\" within seven days. On 30 May 2014, the Presiding Arbitrator acknowledged receipt of additional information from Claimants and another letter from Respondents, noting that \"the Tribunal considers that it has sufficient information to make a costs determination, but will inform the parties if the need for further information arises in the future.\"\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. THE DORNOD PROJECT**\n-------------------------\n\n43.\n\nFrom 1988, commencing under the communist Mongolian People's Republic, to 1995, the Russian state-owned company Priargunsky Production Mining and Chemical Enterprise (\"**Priargunsky**\") extracted uranium oxide from an open pit mine, known as Deposit No. 2 or Ore Body No. 2 (\"**Deposit No. 2**\"), located in Dornod, a province in northeast Mongolia.4 Due to a shortage of funds and a drop in demand for uranium after the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. in 1991, the mine was shut down in mid-1995.5\n\nRespondents' Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 13; Claimants' Counter-memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38; Hearing Transcript (jurisd.) 16:10-13; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21; Statement of Defence, \u00b6 18.\n\nReply, \u00b6 18.\n\n44.\n\nAround the same time, Priargunsky and the Mongolian state-owned company Mongol-Erdene (\"**Erdene**\") formed, with the U.S. company WM Mining Inc. (\"**WM Mining**\"), a joint venture known as the Central Asian Uranium Company Ltd. (\"**CAUC**\"), in order to develop a uranium exploration and extraction project in Dornod (\"**Dornod Project**\").6 WM Mining was wholly owned by Mr. Wallace Mays.7\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 23; Statement of Defence, \u00b6 22.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 22.\n\n45.\n\nThe founders of CAUC executed the following three documents: (i) the Founding Agreement, (ii) the Agreement on Development of Mineral Deposits in Eastern Aimak (Province) of Mongolia between WM Mining, Priargunsky and Erdene (\"**Minerals Agreement**\") and (iii) the Charter of the Company with Limited liability \"Central Asian Uranium Company of Mongolia\" of the Mongolian-Russian-American Venture.8 The Minerals Agreement also was signed by an authorized representative of the Mongolian Ministry of Energy, Geology, and Mining.9 Pursuant to the Minerals Agreement, WM Mining was to contribute \"monetary funds and the services related to locating and obtaining financing for the joint venture.\"10\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 24; *see* Exhibits 16A, 17A, 18A.\n\nExhibit C-17A.\n\nExhibit C-17A (ss. 2.2-2.4); *see also* Memorial, \u00b6 28; Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n\n46.\n\nInitially, each of the three parties held an equal 33.3 percent share of the joint venture. On 12 December 1996, the parties entered into the Agreement on CAUC's Share Redistribution (\"**Share Redistribution Agreement**\"), pursuant to which WM Mining's participation in CAUC was increased to 58 percent in consideration for an additional financial contribution to the joint venture.11\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 29; Statement of Defence, \u00b6 31, referring to Exhibit R-3.\n\n47.\n\nIn 2003, through a series of transactions, Khan Canada became the indirect holder of WM Mining's shares in CAUC. In July 1997, WM Mining had transferred its shares in CAUC to World Wide Mongolia Mining Inc, a British Virgin Islands company that was also wholly owned by Mr. Mays.12 In October 2002 and January 2003, Mr. Mays incorporated Khan Canada and Khan Resources Bermuda Ltd (\"**Khan Bermuda**\"), respectively.13 On 30 July 2003, Mr. Mays transferred his shares in World Wide Mongolia Mining Inc. to Khan Bermuda.14 On 31 July 2003, all of Mr. Mays's shares in Khan Bermuda were transferred to Khan Canada.15 Following Khan Canada's acquisition of World Wide Mongolia Mining Inc., the latter was renamed CAUC Holding on 28 April 2004.\n\nClaimants' Counter-memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 65; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 22; Statement of Defence, \u00b6 39, referring to Exhibit C-16C.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 40, referring to Exhibits C-40, C-44.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 41, referring to Exhibit R-41.\n\nMr. May's shares in Khan Bermuda were transferred to Khan Canada in consideration for the issuance of shares in Khan Canada to another company owned by Mr. Mays, making Mr. Mays the largest (indirect) shareholder in Khan Canada with 42.31 percent of the shares. Statement of Defence, \u00b6 42, referring to Exhibit C-46.\n\n48.\n\nAs for Erdene's share in CAUC, it was successively transferred to the Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia (\"**MRAM**\") on 27 November 2001, the State Property Committee of Mongolia (\"**SPC**\") on 28 March 2005, and MonAtom, a Mongolian company wholly owned and controlled by the SPC, in 2009.16\n\nClaimants' Counter-memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 62, 68; Memorial, \u00b6 30.\n\n49.\n\nWhen this arbitration commenced in 2011, Priargunsky and MonAtom each held a 21 percent share in CAUC, while CAUC Holding, the wholly owned subsidiary of Khan Bermuda (itself the wholly owned subsidiary of Khan Canada), held the remaining 58 percent share in CAUC.\n\n50.\n\nOn 27 March 2003, Khan Canada established a separate subsidiary incorporated in Mongolia -Khan Resources LLC (\"**Khan Mongolia**\") - to help coordinate its activities in Mongolia.17 Originally, all of the shares in Khan Mongolia were held by Khan Bermuda. On 5 September 2007, Khan Netherlands was incorporated for the purpose of holding Khan Mongolia. On 28 May 2008, the Foreign Investment and Trade Agency of Mongolia (the \"FIFTA\") issued a \"Certificate of Foreign Incorporated Company\" recording the transfer of 75 percent of the shares in Khan Mongolia to Khan Netherlands and indicating that the other 25 percent remained with Khan Bermuda.18\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 40; Statement of Defence, \u00b6 40.\n\nCounter-memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 123-124.\n\n51.\n\nAs background to their decision to invest in Mongolia, the Claimants allege that in recent years Mongolia's economy has become one of the \"fastest growing in the world\" due to its mineral wealth and a twenty-plus year campaign to attract foreign investment by creating \"the appearance of a positive investment environment by enacting laws and entering into contracts that, at least on their face, promise a high level of protection to foreign investors.\"19\n\nRespondents' Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 11-19.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondents explain that, after its transition into democracy in 1990, Mongolia spent considerable time and effort to encourage foreign investment, especially from countries other than Russia and China. In the uranium sector in particular, Mongolia wished to benefit from foreign capital and experience.20\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 20-21.\n\n53.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Khan \"always had a champion within the Mongolian Government,\"21 citing assistance and praise received in 2007-2009 from various Mongolian state officials.22 In light of these reassurances, Khan did not perceive any special \"risk\" associated with its investing in Mongolia.23\n\nReply, \u00b6 38.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 38-42.\n\nReply, \u00b6 44.\n\n**B. THE ACQUISITION OF THE MINING AND EXPLORATION LICENSES**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nOn 10 November 1998, the joint venture company CAUC obtained Mineral Exploitation License Number 237A (\"**Mining License**\"), which allowed CAUC to engage in the exploitation of radioactive mineral resources in an area of land covering both Deposit No. 2 and an underground mineral deposit known as Deposit No. 7 or Ore Body No. 7 (\"**Deposit No. 7**\").24\n\nRespondents' Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 17, referring to Exhibit R-4; Claimants' Counter-memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 115-116; Statement of Defence, \u00b6 29.\n\n55.\n\nOn 12 September 2000, on CAUC's application (aimed at tax and fee savings), the Mining License area was reduced to less than a third of its size.25 The new Mining License area (the \"**Main Property**\") excluded a segment of Deposit No. 7.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 44; Statement of Defence, \u00b6 44.\n\n56.\n\nOn 22 April 2005, Khan Mongolia acquired Mineral Exploitation License 9282X (\"**Exploration License**,\" collectively with the Mining License, the \"**Mining and Exploration Licenses**\"), covering the segment of Deposit No. 7 that had previously been excluded from the Mining License area (the \"**Additional Property**\").26\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 47, referring to Exhibit C-76. The Claimants refer to the area covered by the reduced Mining License as the \"Main Property\" and the area covered by the Exploration License as the \"Additional Property,\" while the Respondents refer to the reduced Mining License area as the \"CAUC Property\" and the Exploration License area as the \"Khan Property.\" The Tribunal adopts the Claimants' terminology for clarity, without prejudice to either Party's arguments regarding the alleged unity of the Mining License and the Exploration Licenses. The Tribunal notes that, while agreeing on the facts regarding Khan Mongolia's acquisition of the Exploration License, the Parties narrate the details differently. According to the Claimants, the exclusion of a segment of Deposit No. 7 from the reduced Mining License area was due to a surveying error. Following discovery of this error, the MRAM issued a decision to restore the Mining License to its original size and coordinates. However, in the intervening time, licenses had been issued over a portion of this area to other parties that successfully challenged the MRAM's decision before the Capital City Administrative Court of Mongolia. Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. Given the joint venture's lack of capital, Khan took it upon itself to purchase the Exploration License from Western Prospector Group Ltd. for \"the ultimate benefit of the Project.\" Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47. The Respondents emphasize that Khan Canada first entered into an agreement with Western Prospector in accordance with which Western Prospector would transfer to Khan Canada the portion of its exploration license covering the Additional Property and that only then did Western Prospector obtain the Exploration License. Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47. The Respondents also note that the other CAUC shareholders were not informed of Khan Mongolia's acquisition of the Exploration License. Statement of Defence, \u00b6 48.\n\n**C. THE CLAIMANTS' INTENTIONS REGARDING THE DORNOD PROJECT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants allege that they were committed to bringing the Dornod Project into production and were \"ideally situated\" to help Mongolia develop its uranium resources.27 In their First Post-Hearing Brief, they state that Khan \"reasonably expected to bring the Dornod Project into operation in collaboration with Mongolia.\"28 They gathered an experienced board of directors and management team and hired highly qualified employees.29 They recount investing over USD 50 million.30 Furthermore, Khan independently verified the existence and extent of uranium reserves at the Dornod site by conducting a diamond drilling program and filing a technical report that complied with Canadian (and international) regulatory criteria.31\n\nReply, \u00b6 37.\n\nClaimants' First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 10. The Claimants provide the following reasons for this expectation: The Dornod Project already had a history of development; Mongolia's actions in entering into and performing the Agreements over a period of years demonstrated its commitment to further developing the Dornod Project with the assistance of a foreign investor; Mongolia's actions in the years leading up to Khan's investment further demonstrated that it welcomed foreign mining investment, including in particular Canadian investment; Mongolia accepted Khan as a \"new investor\" in the Dornod Project and the CAUC joint venture after its prior partner proved unable to advance the project; shortly after Khan's investment, the MRAM agreed that the area now covered by the Exploration License should be reunified with the area covered by CAUC's Mining License, expressly citing to the Minerals Agreement as the basis for its action; Khan was subsequently able to acquire the Exploration License from a third party, thus enabling the joint venture parties to achieve commercial production from Deposit No. 7; Khan significantly advanced the Dornod Project towards production by hiring highly qualified professionals, carrying out comprehensive studies, and raising financing for the project; and Khan maintained positive relations with the Government during the course of its investment in the Dornod Project, and Mongolia consistently acted in support of that project in the exercise of its public authority. *See* Claimants' First Post-Hearing Brief, pp. 10-11. *See also* Claimants' Second Post-Hearing Brief, p. 9.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.\n\nReply, \u00b6 32.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 59, 67, referring to Exhibit C-25.\n\n58.\n\nIn 2006-2007, Khan secured financing for the Dornod Project, including approximately USD 14 million in seed money from private investors, USD 6.3 million in an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange and USD 25 million in a follow-on offering.32 These funds were devoted to the development of the Dornod Project.33\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 52.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 53.\n\n59.\n\nAfter obtaining these funds, Khan continued its drilling program, complemented by a magnetometer and gravity survey, and conducted three studies providing an extensive analysis of, among others, the resources and reserves at the site and the costs and methodologies required to exploit the mine in an economically feasible manner.34\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 69, 72-73, 77, 79. The studies are the \"Scoping Study\" (2006), the \"Pre-Feasibility Study\" (August 2007) and the \"Definitive Feasibility Study\" (May 2009).\n\n60.\n\nThe last of these studies was the Definitive Feasibility Study of 4 May 2009 (\"**DFS**\"), which estimated the capital cost for constructing the mining and surface facilities to be in excess of USD 330 million, with a rate of return of the Dornod Project, after taxes, at 29 percent. The DFS also \"conservatively\" estimated the Dornod Project's net value at USD 276 million.35\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 80.\n\n61.\n\nIn addition, Khan retained and funded expert firms to conduct environmental and social assessments, and devoted funds to infrastructure construction in Mongolia.36\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 78-79, referring to First Arsenault Statement, \u00b6 55, Second Edey Statement, \u00b6 33, Exhibits C-50, C-62, C-157.\n\n62.\n\nWith regard to the Respondents' allegation that the Claimants' exploration work reproduced exploration surveys carried out when Priargunsky operated the Dornod site, the Claimants \"readily acknowledge that significant exploration data was developed by Priargunsky before 1995,\" but explain that the data was not verifiable or reproducible because \"the underlying exploration material (*e.g.*, the drill core) was destroyed when Priargunsky abandoned the site.\" Thus, over 8,000 metres of additional drilling were performed to verify and expand upon Priargunsky's data.\n\n63.\n\nMoreover, according to the Claimants, Priargunsky had neither conducted social and environmental impact assessments, nor developed mining plans or engineered processing and support facilities.37 Furthermore, the Claimants dispute the Respondents' allegation that the Claimants did not share the results of their studies with Mongolia, submitting that had Khan's studies duplicated Priargunsky's work, there would have been no need for Khan to share the results with Mongolia.38 The Claimants add that Khan shared its studies with Mongolia.39\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 32.\n\nClaimants' Counter-memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 87-100; Claimants'Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 33, referring to Exhibits C-64, C-65.\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimants also aver that Mongolia knew and accepted that Khan Canada was the ultimate owner and controller of the majority share in CAUC, as well as the ultimate source of financing of the Dornod Project. For instance, on 22 September 2005, the SPC issued a resolution proposing to offer Khan Canada its 21 percent interest in CAUC, thus recognizing, as Claimants argue, that Khan Canada was a \"potential source of immediate and substantial cash\" and was \"the party to deal with on matters relating to CAUC.\"40\n\nClaimants' Counter-memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 103-104; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 27.\n\n65.\n\nRegarding the Respondents' argument that Khan could not have expected to bring the Dornod Project to production as it needed to obtain additional approvals from Mongolia before the commencement of mine operations, the Claimants emphasize that \"Mongolia was obliged by the mandatory terms of Mongolian public laws (as well as by its contractual duty of good faith) to grant such approvals.\"41 Its related argument on the issue of the conversion of the Exploration License into a mining license is discussed in Section V(B) below.\n\nClaimants' Second Post-Hearing Brief, p. 9.\n\n66.\n\nIn contrast, the Respondents allege that \"Khan never intended to take this project forward into operation,\" but, rather, was focused on maximizing the value of Khan Canada in order to sell off its interests at a profit.42 They argue that, when Khan became a partner in CAUC, its main priorities were its Mongolian gold properties, which it did not develop, but proceeded to sell for a profit.43 The Respondents contend that Khan did not have the capability to develop the mining project on its own,44 noting that \"Khan has never taken a project into production\" and reiterating that it \"would not have taken this one forward.\"45 The Respondents further contend that the market conditions during this time were unfavourable to the Dornod Project.46\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 14; Transcript (12 November 2013), 276:19 to 277:8.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 34-37, referring to Exhibits R-80 to R-82.\n\nTranscript (12 November 2013), 279:22 to 280:8.\n\nRespondents' Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 41.\n\nRespondents' Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 41, referring to Transcript (15 November 2013), 806:20-21 and 796:10-13.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondents emphasize that in the seventeen-year existence of CAUC, there have been no mining activities at the Dornod site,47 with the possible exception of a few holes having been drilled.48 They note that \"Khan's only tangible activity was to obtain information in Russia regarding the mineral reserves.\"49\n\nReply, \u00b6 18.\n\nRespondents' First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 11, referring to Exhibit R-67 (p. 2).\n\nRespondents' First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 12.\n\n68.\n\nWhile acknowledging that Khan carried out drilling programs, updated its evaluation of the Dornod deposit reserves and completed various feasibility reports, the Respondents emphasize that Khan Canada would notify the results of its activities to its shareholders in \"an attempt to boost its share price\" on the Toronto Stock Exchange, but consistently fail to inform its partners in CAUC50 or the Mongolian authorities.51 They submit that from 2002 to 2007 there was no communication between the CAUC joint venture partners, as not a single management committee meeting was held during that period.52 Nor were any independent audits of CAUC conducted until September 2007.53\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53, 56, 67, 68; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n\nRespondents' First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 54.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 49.\n\n69.\n\nFurther, the Respondents note that, already in 2006, Khan Canada was preparing for a takeover by adopting an amended shareholders' rights plan \"to ensure the fair treatment of shareholders in connection with any take-over offer for the Corporation.\"54\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 66; Rejoinder, \u00b6 40, referring to Exhibit R-49; Transcript (12 November 2013), 277:9 to 279:3.\n\n70.\n\nThey submit that, as of July 2009, the actual production of the uranium mine was at least three years away,55 as the Claimants had secured neither a strategic partner for the development of the project nor an off-take agreement, pursuant to which the bulk of the financing was to be obtained.56 They state that \"[t]he reality is that the Claimants were not capable of raising the necessary capital,\"57 and conclude that \"Khan had neither the internal capital necessary nor the stature necessary to raise capital, to take the properties into production.\"58\n\nTranscript (12 November 2013), 284:24 to 286:6.\n\nTranscript (12 November 2013), 289:7-18.\n\nRespondents' Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 45.\n\nRespondents' Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 46, referring to Transcript (15 November 2013), 789:3-6.\n\n**D. MONGOLIA'S INVESTIGATION OF CAUC AND KHAN MONGOLIA'S ACTIVITIES AND THE INVALIDATION OF THE MINING AND EXPLORATION LICENSES**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nIn April 2005, and, again, in May 2006, the State Specialized Inspection Agency of Mongolia (\"**SSIA**\") inspected the Dornod site, reporting several violations of Mongolian law, including breaches of the Radiation Protection and Safety Law.59\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 57-64, referring to Exhibits R-8, R-47, R-48;

In fact, the agreements contemplated would protect the rights of third parties, including Khan.111 The Respondents clarify that, at the May 2008 meeting between governmental representatives of Russia and Mongolia, there was not any mention of Khan being ousted from the joint venture.112\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 333-338.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 335, referring to First Bailikhuu Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondents emphasize that Mongolia has not granted licenses for the areas previously covered by the invalidated Mining and Exploration Licenses,113 and note that these properties remain undeveloped, contrary to the commercial interests of Mongolia.114 They also indicate that, to date, no strictly Mongolian-Russian joint venture has been formed.115\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 339.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 340.\n\nRespondents' First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 36.\n\n**IV.

THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS ON LIABILITY**\n------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondents (and Mongolia, in particular) unlawfully deprived the Claimants of both their investment, in the form of the Mining and Exploration Licenses, and their contractual rights under the Agreements. The Claimants also bring claims against the Respondents for the breach of the duties of good faith and loyalty in relation to the Parties' joint venture and for treatment in contravention of Mongolian and international law.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants identify the following factual bases for their claims:\n\n(i) the temporary suspension of the Mining License on 10 July 2009;\n\n(ii) the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL and the subsequent invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses;\n\n(iii) the alleged refusal of Mongolia to comply with the decisions of its administrative courts, which required it to reinstate the Mining and Exploration Licenses; and\n\n(iv) the wrongful undermining of the Claimants' business reputation through the media.128\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 277-278 (emphasis omitted).\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondents dispute the Claimants' interpretation of events and deny being liable for any of the actions taken.\n\n104.\n\nUnderlying the general framework of the Claimants' claims as summarized above are separate claims brought by the individual Claimants pursuant to different arbitration agreements and invoking different legal standards.\n\n105.\n\nKhan Canada and CAUC Holding bring claims against Mongolia and MonAtom pursuant to the arbitration agreement in Article 12 of the Founding Agreement for the deprivation of their rights in relation to the Mining License and the Agreements, as well as for the Respondents' failure to act in good faith for the advancement of the joint venture. They bring their claims on the following bases:\n\n(i) Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement, which states that \"[p]roperty of the Company [CAUC] will not be subject to requisition or confiscation;\"\n\n(ii) Article 8.1 of the Foreign Investment Law, which entitles foreign investment in Mongolia to legal protection;\n\n(iii) Articles 8.2 and 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law, which prohibits the unlawful expropriation of foreign investment within the territory of Mongolia;\n\n(iv) Article 9 of the Foreign Investment Law, which obliges Mongolia to accord foreign investors treatment no less favourable than the treatment accorded to Mongolian investors;\n\n(v) the duty of good faith as reflected in Article 13 of the 2002 Civil Code;\n\n(vi) the duty of loyalty as reflected in Article 83 of the Company Law; and\n\n(vii) the international minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law (against Mongolia only).129\n\n*See* structure of Claimants' Pre-Hearing Brief.\n\n106.\n\nIn turn, Khan Netherlands brings claims against Mongolia pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT for the deprivation of its rights under the Exploration License, as well as for Mongolia's failure to act in good faith for the advancement of the joint venture. The Respondents submit that the claims brought under the ECT must be limited to those relating to the indirect interest of Khan Netherlands in the Additional Property, in the form of its 75 percent ownership of Khan Mongolia, the holder of the Exploration License.130 Khan Netherlands brings its claims on the following bases:\n\n(i) Article 13 of the ECT;\n\n(ii) the umbrella clause set out in Article 10.1 of the ECT, in relation to Mongolia's obligations under the Foreign Investment Law; and\n\n(iii) the fair and equitable treatment obligation set out in Article 10.1 of the ECT.131\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 308.\n\n*See* structure of Claimants' Pre-Hearing Brief.\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the Tribunal must apply the international minimum standard as an independent basis for its decision on those issues to which Mongolian law applies if it finds that the Constitution does not require Mongolia to uphold this standard or if the protection offered by Mongolian law falls below it.132\n\nClaimants' Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 42; Claimants' First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 9.\n\n108.\n\nWhile the Parties do not dispute the framework under which the Claimants bring their claims, they disagree regarding the interaction of these different legal standards in application to these proceedings as well as the nature of the investment in question, with specific regard to the alleged unity of investment comprising the Mining and Exploration Licenses. Subsequent sections discuss these issues as well as the Parties' other arguments on the merits.\n\n**A. PRELIMINARY ARGUMENTS ON THE APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the legal standards that apply to the claims of Khan Canada and CAUC Holding, on the one hand, and those of Khan Netherlands, on the other hand, are \"closely intertwined at every level of the analysis.\"133 The Claimants also submit that Mongolian law was intended to coincide with international law, which means that the latter should assist in the interpretation of the former.134\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 193.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 272-276, referring to First Tsogt Report, \u00b6 11, Exhibits CLA-136 (Foreword), CLA-122 (emphasis added).\n\nThe corresponding provisions of the ECT and the Foreign Investment Law are substantially identical.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the corresponding provisions of the ECT and the Foreign Investment Law are substantially identical.135 For example, Article 13 of the ECT (that allows expropriations only if they are in the public interest, not discriminatory, carried out under due process of law, and accompanied by compensation)136 is \"substantially identical\" to Articles 8.2 and 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law (with Article 8.2 prohibiting unlawful expropriation and Article 8.3 stating that investments may be expropriated only for the public interest in accordance with due process of law on a non-discriminatory basis, and on payment of compensation).137\n\nClaimants' First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 8.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 211, referring to Exhibit CLA-53 (art. 13).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 215-217, referring to Exhibit CLA-8 (arts. 8.2, 8.3); Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 63-75.\n\n111.\n\nWith respect to their claims concerning their treatment and that of their investments, the Claimants raise a number of points. First, they note that Khan Netherlands invokes the umbrella clause in Article 10.1 of the ECT to raise claims for breaches of the Foreign Investment Law, which Khan Canada and CAUC Holding raise directly.138 Second, the Claimants contend that Article 10.7 of the ECT, which obliges the State to accord the covered investments \"treatment no less favourable\" than that extended to domestic investors as well as other foreign investors139 is substantially identical to Article 9 of the Foreign Investment Law, which requires Mongolia to accord foreign investors \"favorable conditions not less than those accorded to Mongolian investors.\"140 The Claimants submit that the duty of loyalty141 and the duty of good faith142 under Mongolian law provide for the same treatment. Third, the Claimants argue that the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 10.1 of the ECT143 is also provided for under Mongolian law in the form of the duties of good faith144 and loyalty.145 Fourth, the Claimants argue that the guarantee in Article 10.1 of the ECT against the impairment of qualifying investments via unreasonable or discriminatory measures146 expresses the negative aspect of the fair and equitable treatment obligation,147 and has an effect equivalent to Article 8.1 of the Foreign Investment Law, which guarantees foreign investments \"legal protection guaranteed by the Constitution, this law and other legislation, consistent with those laws and [Mongolian] international treaties.\"148 Lastly, the Claimants contend that the guarantee in the ECT that covered investments be accorded treatment no less favourable than that required by international law149 obliges the State to comply with the international minimum standard,150 a requirement that Mongolian law also imposes.151 The Claimants thus submit that the guarantee in Article 10.12 of the ECT that the domestic law of the State provide effective means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights related to the covered investments152 can be subsumed under the guarantee against the denial of justice,153 and forms part of the international minimum standard.154\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 223.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 221, 226, referring to Exhibit CLA-53 (art. 10.7).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 224-225, referring to Exhibit CLA-9 (art. 9).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 226, referring to Exhibit CLA-46 (arts. 81.2, 82.1.5).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 226, referring to Exhibit CLA-117 (art. 13).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 221, referring to Exhibit CLA-53 (art. 10.1).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 228-229, referring to Exhibit CLA-117 (art. 13).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 230-231, referring to Exhibit CLA-46 (arts. 81.2, 82.1.5).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 221, referring to Exhibit CLA-53 (art. 10.1).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 232, referring to Exhibit CLA-178 (\u00b6 259).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 234-237, referring to Exhibits CLA-8 (art. 8.1), CLA-26A (arts. 1.2, 46.2);

Exhibit CLA-117 (art. 545).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 196, referring to Exhibits C-16A (art. 16.1), C-17A (Preamble and art. 10), CLA-117 (art. 1.3), RL-50 (art. 5.2); Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 347; Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 203, 206.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 199, referring to Exhibit C-16A (art. 2.1); Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 201-202. *See also* Reply, \u00b6 67.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 197-198, referring to Exhibit RL-50 (arts. 5.2, 12.1, 12.3); Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 206. *See also* Reply, \u00b6 67.\n\n113.\n\nIn the context of this civil relationship, Mongolia assumed sovereign commitments in the Agreements159 pursuant to Article 12 of the 1995 Minerals Law, which authorizes the Government to determine the terms applicable to State participation in a mining venture.160 Because the obligations assumed by the State in the Agreements conform to the relevant Mongolian legislation, the Claimants contend that they are valid and enforceable.161 In practical terms, this means that, for matters specifically regulated by the Agreements, the terms of the Agreements prevail over generally applicable public law (save the Constitution); whereas for matters not specifically regulated by the Agreements but nonetheless connected to their subject matter, Mongolia is bound by the civil duties of good faith and loyalty not to frustrate the underlying purpose of the Agreements, inasmuch as the civil obligation of the State exists alongside the laws governing its administrative conduct.162 This means, therefore, that the failure by Mongolia to abide by its sovereign commitments under the Agreements will amount to a breach of the civil obligations it owes its joint venture partners.163\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 201, referring to Exhibits C-16A (arts. 3.6, 5.3), C-17A (arts. 1.1, 2, 4.3, 7, 13), C-18A (art. 4.3).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 202, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 211-212.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 202, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 212-213.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 203, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 213-216.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 204. On this note, the Claimants state that the determination of the scope of the relevant civil obligation is dependent on (i) whether the obligation properly overrode the applicable public law; (ii) if public law was applicable, whether it permitted an alternative action less prejudicial to the Agreements; and (iii) if it did not, whether the application of the public law was proper and equitable. Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 205-206, referring to Exhibit CLA-136 (art. 13.1).\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondents' argument that actions taken by Mongolia in its sovereign capacity somehow shield Mongolia from civil liability. They contend that civil obligations are defined not by the capacity in which an obligor performs an obligation but by the subject-matter of the obligation, its voluntary assumption and performance, the parity between the parties in the contractual setting, and the legal protection of the rights of each party to demand performance from the other.164\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 73-74, referring to Exhibit CLA-117 (arts. 1.1, 1.20); Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6 9.\n\n115.\n\nRelatedly, in response to the Respondents' argument that the 2002 Civil Code does not apply to the Agreements because they create a relationship of administrative subordination, the Claimants contend that Mongolia does not automatically become a party to a \"relationship based on administrative subordination\" upon its exercise of sovereign powers.165 As previously stated, the Claimants clarify that the relationship between the parties to the Agreements does not depend on the use of governmental powers, but, rather, on the voluntary assumption by the Government of civil commitments that entail the use of sovereign powers.166\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 75.\n\nClaimants' First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 14.\n\nThe Mining and Exploration Licenses are property under Mongolian law.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondents' corollary argument that the alleged non-application of the 2002 Civil Code to relationships of administrative subordination means that the Mining and Exploration Licenses are not property. They also reject the Respondents' argument that the licenses cannot be transferred or pledged freely and are not, therefore, property. As a preliminary matter, the Claimants stress that, were this not the case, the current Minerals Law would not require the State to compensate the holder of a minerals license who is impeded in its ability to carry out its authorized exploration or mining activities by the State's establishment of a special protected area.167\n\nClaimants' First Post-Hearing Brief, pp. 1-2.\n\n117.\n\nAs regards the specific issue of whether the licenses can be transferred or pledged, the Claimants note that Article 49 of the 2006 Minerals Law allows minerals licenses to be transferred and Articles 51 and 52 of the 2006 Minerals Law contemplate the pledging of these licenses.168 The Claimants also reject the Respondents' reliance on the Mongolian Supreme Court decision in *Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom* as evidence that minerals licenses cannot be pledged; they clarify that this decision dealt with the applicability of the 2002 Civil Code provisions on tangible property to the pledging of mineral licenses, but said nothing about whether rights conferred under licenses could constitute intangible property for the license-holder.169\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 75-77, referring to Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6 67; Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 63, 71-75; 194, n. 35; Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6 173; Claimants' Second Post-Hearing Brief, p. 2.\n\nClaimants' First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 2.\n\nAdministrative law is relevant to the Claimants' claims under Mongolian and international law.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the arbitration clauses in the Founding Agreement and the ECT preclude claims based on Mongolian administrative law *per se*, the Claimants nevertheless contend that Mongolian administrative law forms the factual predicate for their claims under Mongolian civil law and international law.170 The Claimants also contend that the issue of whether Mongolia has properly applied its administrative law is relevant to the resolution of the claims brought under the ECT, which requires the State to apply its laws fairly, transparently and in accordance with due process of law,171 and to the claims brought under the Foreign Investment Law, which requires the State to properly apply its laws relating to foreign investment and to follow due process of law.172\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 194, referring to Exhibit CLA-53 (art. 26.6); Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 192-202.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 207.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 208, referring to Exhibit CLA-8 (arts. 8.1, 8.3).\n\nInternational law is relevant to the interpretation and application of the Founding Agreement.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nAs regards the claims brought by Khan Canada and CAUC Holding, the Claimants submit that the parties to the Founding Agreement must be deemed to have consented to the application of international law given the broad wording of the arbitration agreement in Article 12, that the Minerals Agreement is an international investment agreement and that international public policy requires the application of international principles.173 In response to the Respondents' contention that the international law claims brought by the Claimants under the Founding Agreement are limited to those concerning the infringement of the Claimants' direct rights as CAUC shareholders,174 the Claimants note that their only potentially derivative claims are for Mongolia's breach of its duties of good faith and loyalty to CAUC, which have been deemed by the Tribunal to fall within the scope of Article 12 of the Founding Agreement.175 The Claimants clarify that their claims concern the illegal interference with their contractual rights under the Agreements,176 which are valid legal entitlements under Mongolian law177 and subject to protection under international law as property rights.178\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 250-269.\n\nReply, \u00b6 55.\n\nReply, \u00b6 57, referring to Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 378.\n\nReply, \u00b6 58, referring to Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 170, 176-177.\n\nReply, \u00b6 61, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 192-216, Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 11-22.\n\nReply, \u00b6 60, referring to Exhibits CLA-165 (\u00b6 304), CLA-177 (\u00b6 387), CLA-204 (\u00b6 240), CLA-205 (\u00b6 136), CLA-213 (\u00b6 98).\n\n120.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the claims brought by Khan Netherlands must be resolved according to international law, in accordance with the ECT and customs and principles of international law, and note that international law should also serve gap-filling and interpretative functions.179\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 242-244, referring to Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 116-119; Exhibits CLA-17 (art. 31), CLA-53 (arts. 10.1, 26.6).\n\n*The Respondents' position*\n---------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondents emphasize the difference between the legal standards applicable to the claims of Khan Canada and CAUC Holding, on the one hand, and the claims of Khan Netherlands, on the other hand. They also reject the view that Mongolian law and international law are similar. The Foreign Investment Law and the ECT do not have similar effect.\n\n122.\n\nAs regards the Claimants' claims for breaches of Mongolian law, the Respondents contend that the effects of the relevant Foreign Investment Law provisions are different from the corresponding ECT provisions, primarily because a Mongolian court would interpret the provisions of the Foreign Investment Law in the context of the Mongolian legal system.180 The Respondents further contend that the Tribunal's interpretation and application of Mongolian law should not be conducted in light of \"general principles of international law\" but should, rather, accord to how domestic law would be interpreted and applied in Mongolia.181\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 157, referring to First Bayar Report, \u00b6 118.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 136.\n\nThe Mining and Exploration Licenses do not constitute \"property\" under the 2002 Civil Code and Mongolian law.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondents clarify that the 2002 Civil Code, which is the source of the obligation of good faith, and the Company Law, which is the source of the duty of loyalty, do not apply to actions of the State taken in the exercise of its sovereign authority.182 Specifically, the Respondents argue that Article 1.2 of the Civil Code of Mongolia, 1994 and Article 1.3 of the 2002 Civil Code exclude the application of this Code to relationships based on administrative subordination, such as the one in the present case, where Mongolia suspended and terminated the licenses in the exercise of its administrative power.183 Mining licenses, moreover, create precisely this kind of relationship between the Government and the license-holders.184 And secondly, the Respondents contend that the 2002 Civil Code establishes a special regime with respect to the transfer of ownership and pledge, while mining and exploration licenses cannot be freely pledged or transferred.185\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 296-297, referring to First Bayar Report, \u00b6 116.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 169-171, referring to Exhibit CLA-117 (art. 1.3); Second Bayar Report, \u00b6 35; Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6 75.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 159, referring to First Bayar Report, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 186-188, referring to Exhibit CLA-117 (art. 1.3); Second Bayar Report, \u00b6 32.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 184-185, referring to Second Bayar Report, \u00b6 39.\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondents refer to the decision of the Mongolian Supreme Court in *Gobi Shoo LLC v.

THE ALLEGED UNITY OF INVESTMENTS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimants' position*\n-------------------------\n\n130.\n\nWhile the Mineral License and the Exploration License can each be considered an investment in its own right,201 the Claimants submit that there really is only one investment at issue in this case: \"the mining and development of the Dornod Project, including principally Deposit No. 7, by the CAUC joint venture.\"202 The Claimants reason that \"uranium could not be economically mined and produced from Deposit No. 7 by virtue of the rights conferred under either of the Licenses alone.\"203 Accordingly, they contend that the impairment of rights conferred under either license equates to a breach of the obligations owed to the holders of both Licenses - that is, to all the Claimants.204\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 170-175.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 177.\n\nClaimants' First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 9.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 188.\n\n131.\n\nFirst, the Claimants argue that the Agreements themselves envisage this unity of investment. Thus, in the Minerals Agreement, Mongolia \"guarantee[d] in compliance with the Mineral Law of Mongolia [the] issuance of a license permitting development of [Deposit No. 2] and [Deposit No. 7],\" and \"contribute[d] the right to utilize [Deposit No. 7]\" to CAUC once the economic viability of the deposit was shown.205 Consequently, the original Mining License covered the entirety of Deposits Nos. 2 and 7, and was intended to continue to cover these deposits even after its size was reduced at CAUC's request in 1998. The Exploration License was acquired by the Claimants only as a result of an inadvertent surveying error that excluded a segment of Deposit No. 7 from the area of the Mining License.206\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 176, referring to Exhibit C-17A (arts. 1.1, 5.4).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 178, referring to Exhibits C-74, CLA-193 (\u00b6 4.16).\n\n132.\n\nWhile they financed the acquisition of the Exploration License themselves, the Claimants stress that their intention was always to use the Additional Property to benefit the Dornod Project as a whole.207 In this respect, the Claimants note that the Respondents contradict themselves when they insist, on the one hand, that the Mining and Exploration Licenses are entirely unconnected and, on the other hand, that Khan Canada had acquired the Exploration License for its own benefit and at the expense of the joint venture.208 The Claimants contend that all joint venture partners were not only aware of the acquisition of the Exploration License but also openly recognized and jointly acknowledged that the planned merger of the Exploration License with the Mining License was necessary for the economic viability of the Dornod Project.209\n\nReply, \u00b6 243, referring to Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 337.\n\nReply, \u00b6 237.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 239-241, referring to Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 337, 339; Second Arsenault Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 67, referring to Exhibits C-378, C-379. *See also* Reply, \u00b6 242, referring to Exhibits C-4 (\u00b6 68), C-32 (p. 2), C-39 (p. 3), C-122, C-291, C-357, C-378, C-380; Davis Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, 59; Respondents' Post-Bifurcation Hearing Submission, \u00b6 42.\n\n133.\n\nSecond, the Claimants argue that Khan Canada had a right under the Agreements to the reunification of the Mining and Exploration Licenses. Article 38.5 of the 1995 Minerals Law (under which the Mineral License was issued) allows a mineral license holder to request changes to the concession boundary in response to changes in the deposit size210 and Article 40 of the Minerals Law of 5 June 1997 (\"**1997 Minerals Law**\") (under which the Exploration License was issued) allows a license holder to transfer the license.211 The Claimants contend that Mongolia's duties of good faith and loyalty toward its partners in CAUC required Mongolia to apply the minerals laws in furtherance of the purpose of the CAUC joint venture.212\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 181, referring to Exhibit RL-50 (art. 38.5);

Exhibit C-17A (art. 5.4).\n\n134.\n\nThird, the Claimants allege that they attempted to convert the Exploration License into a mining license in the fastest possible time.213 When the Exploration License was invalidated by the MRAM in August 2007 on the basis that Khan had not converted it into a mining license,214 Khan immediately wrote to the MRAM explaining that it was in the process of registering the Dornod reserves, which was a prerequisite for the conversion of the Exploration License to a mining license.215 The Claimants allege that MRAM Chairman Luvsanvandan Bold clarified, via a public statement on 10 September 2007, that the exploration licenses that had been invalidated the previous month (including Khan's) would remain valid, as long as their licenseholders converted them to mining licenses.216 Khan therefore submitted an application for conversion on 14 September 2007.217 In a meeting with Khan representatives on 17 September 2007, Chairman Bold explained that the conversion of the Exploration License was being delayed due to the designation of the Dornod deposit as \"of strategic importance.\"218 On 27 November 2007, the MRAM instructed Khan to wait until the Minerals Council had reached a decision on the registration of the Dornod deposit reserves before attempting to convert the Exploration License into a mining license.219 The Claimants conclude by noting that Khan had met all of the legal requirements to obtain mining rights over the Additional Property and that \"Mongolia later used these delays in its administrative process to justify its failure to ever consider Khan's application to convert the Exploration License to a mining license.\"220\n\nReply, \u00b6 323.\n\nReply, \u00b6 324, referring to Exhibit C-284, Second Arsenault Statement, \u00b6 93.\n\nReply, \u00b6 325, referring to Exhibit C-387, Second Arsenault Statement, \u00b6 93.\n\nReply, \u00b6 326, referring to Exhibit C-387, Second Arsenault Statement, \u00b6 93.\n\nReply, \u00b6 327, referring to Exhibit C-241, Second Arsenault Statement, \u00b6 95.\n\nReply, \u00b6 327, referring to Exhibit C-380, Second Arsenault Statement, \u00b6 96.\n\nReply, \u00b6 328, referring to Exhibit C-162.\n\nReply, \u00b6 330.\n\n135.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that, when the NEA cancelled its Exploration License, Khan Mongolia as the holder of an exploration license221 had a vested right to a mining license.222 The Claimants add that the MRAM has no discretion in considering applications for conversion, as the 2006 Minerals Law both enumerates the requirements for obtaining a mining license and lists all possible decisions on an application and their bases.223 They also note that, because Khan Mongolia had met all the legal requirements to obtain mining rights over the Additional Property, Khan was justified in its expectation that a mining license would be issued for it.224\n\nReply, \u00b6 146, referring to Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6 131.\n\nReply, \u00b6 147.\n\nReply, \u00b6 145, referring to Claimants' Second Post-Hearing Brief, p. 10;

Respondents' Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 13, referring to Transcript (12 November 2013), 242:22 to 243:2.\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondents stress that the Additional Property was excluded from the scope of the Mining License due to CAUC Holding's own decision to reduce the Mining License area, and refer to the confirmation of this decision in 2004 by the Administrative Court.227\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 166, 168, referring to Exhibit C-73.\n\n139.\n\nFurther, the Respondents contend that the Claimants sought to acquire the Exploration License for their benefit alone. They argue that, even in the face of the Respondents' requests for information regarding the area that was excluded from the Mining License,228 the Claimants did not inform the SPC or Priargunsky of (i) the surveying error that allegedly led to the exclusion of a segment of Deposit No. 7 from the Mining License area, (ii) the necessity of acquiring mining rights over the excluded area in order to ensure the economic viability of CAUC or (iii) the Claimants' plan to acquire the Exploration License.229\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 174-175, referring to Exhibits R-51, R-53.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 173.\n\n140.\n\nMoreover, the Respondents argue, Khan Mongolia treated the Exploration License as separate from the Mining License, and did not seek to have the two licenses merged.230 To illustrate this argument, the Respondents refer to the Claimants' draft proposals for an updated joint venture agreement that describe the area of the joint venture as the area covered by the Mining License, without any reference to the Exploration License or the Additional Property.231 The Respondents note that there were no further draft proposals for an updated joint venture agreement and, ultimately, no joint venture agreement.232 They also refer to a publication by Khan dated 4 February 2008 for the Toronto Stock Exchange that mentions the joint venture only with regard to the Mining License, and not the Exploration License.233\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 177-178; Transcript (12 November 2013), 242:22 to 243:3.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 178, referring to Exhibit R-59, Transcript (11 November 2013), 233:3-8; Respondents' Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, referring to Transcript (11 November 2013), 231:14 and 233:3-8.\n\nTranscript (12 November 2013) 306:9-19.\n\nTranscript (12 November 2013) 307:11to 309:21, referring to Exhibit R-70.\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondents further argue that Khan required mining licenses over both the Main Property and the Additional Property in order for the Dornod Project to be profitable, and stress that, while Khan had a Mining License over the Main Property, it had only an Exploration License over the Additional Property, which was in any event due to expire in February 2011.234 In practical terms, this means that Khan would have had to first convert its Exploration License into a mining license, before it could be merged with the existing Mining License.235\n\nRespondents' Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 39.\n\nRespondents' Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 40.\n\n142.\n\nYet, the Respondents submit, Khan was not entitled to the conversion of the Exploration License into a mining license.236 Mongolian law does not grant the owner of an exploration license the automatic right to convert that license into a mining license,237 but instead conditions this conversion on the meeting of several requirements and the approval of the Mongolian authorities.238 Khan's 14 September 2007 application for the conversion of the Exploration License into a mining license lacked certain requirements listed in Article 25 of the 2006 Minerals Law.239 Because the conversion of the Exploration License into a mining license was conditional and not guaranteed,240 the Respondents argue that the Exploration License \"represents the interest of Khan Mongolia, and should be assessed at face value.\"241\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 181.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 182.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 184-186, referring to Exhibits R-71 (p. 26), C-50 (pp. 1-12).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 192, referring to First Bayar Report, \u00b6 50. The Respondents note that art. 25 of the 2006 Minerals Law requires the holder of an exploration license that wishes to convert its exploration license into a mining license to submit (i) the Mineral Council\u2019s minutes on the exploration work results, and a decision of the Government agency and (ii) an environmental impact assessment.

The July 2009 Temporary Suspension of the Mining License**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimants\u2019 position*\n-------------------------\n\n144.\n\nIn line with their overall argument that Mongolia\u2019s conduct leading up to the permanent invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses was wrongful,246 the Claimants submit that the July 2009 temporary suspension of the Mining License by the MRAM was both an improper act under Mongolian law247 and one of the pretexts for the eventual expropriation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses.248 Specifically, the Claimants contend that the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL was connected to the temporary suspension of the Mining License (see paragraph 173 below).249\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 277-278.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 277-278.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 99.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 317, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 130;

Claimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, p. 3.\n\n146.\n\nWith respect to Khan\u2019s alleged violation of Mongolian law through its failure to register the Dornod mineral reserves in Mongolia while publishing information thereon on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the Claimants submit that Khan Canada\u2019s actions on the Toronto Stock Exchange could not have violated Mongolian law, as Khan Canada was neither registered in Mongolia nor subject to the jurisdiction of the SSIA.252\n\nReply, \u00b6 310, referring to Exhibits R-62 (p. 5), C-84 (referring to Letter No. 07/07/09 from Khan Resources, Inc. to Mineral Resources Authority, dated 17 July 2009), C-111, C-474; Second Arsenault Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 138-140.\n\n147.\n\nFurther, the Claimants argue that Mongolia was itself at fault for failing to register the Dornod mineral reserves, as the sole responsibility of the license holder is to submit reserve estimates to the competent authority, while the actual registering of the reserves falls to the State.253 The Claimants contend that they exerted all efforts to have the Domod reserves registered by the Minerals Council, but to no avail.254 Specifically, while Khan submitted an application for the registration of a re-estimate of the Dornod reserves on 29 August 2008,255 the relevant authorities delayed reviewing this application for over a year.256 The Team of Experts that was finally appointed in October 2009 recommended that the Dornod deposits be registered in the State Integrated Registry257 and proposed minor corrections,258 to which Khan provided a comprehensive response on 19 January 2010.259 The Claimants note that neither the Team of Experts nor the Minerals Council requested further revisions after this.260 They submit that while it is \"extremely rare\" for the Minerals Council not to follow a recommendation from a Team of Experts,261 in this case, the meeting of the Minerals Council to approve the Team of Experts\u2019 recommendation was postponed shortly before its scheduled time,262 never to be rescheduled.263 Moreover, Khan\u2019s reserve re-estimate report was never rejected.264\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 288-294, referring to Exhibits CLA-126 (arts. 45.2, 48 (which instituted mineral reserve registration in Mongolia)), CLA-140 (art. 39.2.2), RL-50 (art. 27);

They dismiss the Claimants\u2019 argument that these inspections were brief and instead stress that such inspections lasted up to a week;285 refer to the testimony of Mr. Munkhtamir, a senior SSIA inspector, who explained that the inspections were not politically motivated and that the inspectors had acted impartially;286 and note that Ms. Davis, on whose testimony the Claimants rely for their argument that the inspections were atypical, was not present during either the 2009 or 2010 inspections.287\n\nRespondents\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 30, referring to Exhibits R-9, C-409.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 31, referring to Transcript (13 November 2013), 534:22-24 and 536:1-8.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 32,\n\n157.\n\nThe Respondents argue that, most importantly, the Claimants violated Article 45 of the Subsoil Law288 and Articles 25.1.5, 48.3 and 48.4 of the 2006 Minerals Law when they published information about the Dornod mineral reserves on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2006, without first registering them in the State Integrated Registry or otherwise sharing information about them with either Mongolia or their partners in CAUC.289 The Respondents state that \"it is ironic\" for the Claimants to argue in this arbitration that Mongolia should be held liable for not registering Khan\u2019s reserves, given that, by 2008, when Khan finally made its application for the registration of the Dornod reserves, it had already been in breach of Mongolian law for two years and that this application, therefore, was belated.290\n\nStatement of Defence, 206, referring to Exhibit CLA-126 (arts. 45.1, 45.2); Respondents\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 18.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 208, 210, 219, referring to Exhibits R-9, R-62, C-24, C-25, CL-118 (arts. 48.3, 48.4), CL-126 (arts. 45.1, 45.2).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 211; Respondents\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 18.\n\n158.\n\nThe Respondents add that, with respect to Khan\u2019s 2008 application, Mongolia followed standard procedure. It appointed a Team of Experts,291 which identified deficiencies and insufficiencies in Khan\u2019s application materials292 and noted that the application contained little input from Khan, being based largely on data provided by Priargunsky.293\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 211, referring to Exhibit C-135.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 212; Respondents\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 21, referring to Transcript (13 November 2013), 548:10-14.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 212, referring to First Bilegsaikhan Statement, \u00b6 31.\n\n159.\n\nWhile Khan\u2019s application was being considered, the NEL, on the basis of which the NEA decided not to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses, took effect, making any decision on Khan\u2019s application for the registration of the Dornod reserves unnecessary.294 In other words, \"this process of registering the reserves became moot at that time as the [Mining and Exploration] Licenses had to be re-registered under the new applicable regime.\"295 According to the Respondents, this meant that neither the Team of Experts nor the Minerals Council ever reviewed the accuracy of the updated reserve report.296\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 213.\n\nRespondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 29.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 23.\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondents further argue that the Claimants were in breach of: (i) Article 19.2.3 of the 2006 Minerals Law, due to an overlap between the Exploration License area and the protected Yakhi Lake reserve, (ii) Article 33.1 of the Law on Special Protected Areas, due to the storage of radioactive materials in the protected Yakhi Lake reserve,297 (iii) Article 5.4 of the 2006 Minerals Law, due to a failure to \"enter into a mining agreement with the MRAM,\" and (iv) the Radiation Protection and Safety Law, despite having been previously notified of this violation during the SSIA inspections of 2005 and 2006.298\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 220, referring to Exhibits R-9, R-62.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 221, referring to Exhibit R-62. Among these alleged breaches was the alleged failure of Khan Mongolia to finalize its radioactive waste management programme, to provide its employees with radiation protective clothes or equipment, and to implement a practice on surface contamination control measurement.\n\n161.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, Khan itself admitted to having committed these breaches of Mongolian law, both in a letter to the SSIA dated 22 April 2009 and at a meeting with the SSIA of the same date during which Mr. Erdenebileg (representing CAUC) agreed to remedy these breaches.299\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 222-223, referring to Exhibit R-63, First Munkhtamir Statement, \u00b6 24, Exhibit R-64 (Respondents\u2019 translation of Exhibit C-128).\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondents also contend that the Suspension Notice issued by the MRAM complied with Articles 13.1 and 13.3 of the Licensing Law, which allow the three-month suspension of a license based on the evaluation of a specialized inspection authority.300 They note that, in reaching its decision, the MRAM did not \"blindly\" rely on the conclusions of the SSIA, but rather had \"ample\" time to consider its findings, since three months elapsed between the submission of the April 2009 SSIA report to the MRAM and the issuance of the Suspension Notice in July 2OO9.301 As for Article 13.2 of the State Inspection Law, it was cited in the Suspension Notice because it relates to the obligation of business entities to remedy their violations of the law.302\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 226, referring to Memorial, \u00b6 297.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 227, referring to Memorial, \u00b6 300, Exhibit R-62.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 226, referring to Memorial, \u00b6 297, Exhibit CLA-147 (art. 13.2).\n\n163.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the April 2009 SSIA Report was never provided to CAUC, the Respondents note that the results of the SSIA inspection were discussed during the meeting of 22 April 2009, which was attended by representatives of both CAUC and Khan Mongolia,303 and that a copy of the July 2009 SSIA Report was provided to CAUC a week after it was requested.304 Under Mongolian law, therefore, Khan was afforded a sufficient opportunity to present its position.305\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 228, referring to Exhibit R-63.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 228, referring to Exhibit C-167.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 228, referring to First Bayar Report, \u00b6 72.\n\n**D. THE NEL, THE LPCNEL AND THE INVALIDATION OF THE MINING AND EXPLORATION LICENSES**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimants\u2019 position*\n-------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL confirmed Mongolia\u2019s intention to expropriate the Claimants\u2019 rights under the Mining and Exploration Licenses and the Agreements,306 while the expropriation was consummated by the subsequent invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses through the NEA\u2019s issuance of the Permanent Invalidation Notices and its subsequent refusal to re-register the licenses.307\n\nMemorial, p. 113, title B.\n\nMemorial, p. 128, title C.\n\n*(i) The Enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL confirmed Mongolia\u2019s expropriatory intent because, had these laws been properly applied (which they were not), they would have infringed the Claimants\u2019 rights in the Mining and Exploration Licenses and the Agreements.\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimants highlight three problematic features of the NEL and the LPCNEL. First, Article 5.2 of the NEL required Mongolia to take ownership of \"no less than 51 percent of stake in the joint company, where exploration and determination of [uranium] reserve have been conducted with state budget.\"308 Second, the LPCNEL provided for the retroactive application of the NEL by giving the NEA significant discretion309 to reject re-registration applications on the basis of violations of the NEL and providing that licenses that were not re-registered would be revoked.310 Third, uranium licenses issued under the NEL would grant license holders limited rights as compared to uranium licenses previously issued in Mongolia.311\n\nExhibit RL-11 (arts. 5.2, 5.3). *See also* Memorial, \u00b6 132, referring to Exhibits RL-11, CLA-142;

(ii) the opposition of Mr. Enkhbat - the head of the NEA and its \"reputed architect\" - to Khan\u2019s involvement in the Dornod Project; and (iii) the temporary suspension of the Mining License a mere six days prior to the enactment of these laws.327 The Claimants also contend that the LPCNEL was targeted at two foreign companies, namely Khan and Western Prospector Group Ltd. **(\"Western Prospector\").328** The Claimants also note that the Mongolian Prime Minister controlled both the NEA, which was created by the NEL, and the SSIA.329 As regards the connection to the SSIA, \"the agency that had first fabricated allegations against Khan,\" the Claimants allege that the MRAM was unable to lift the suspension of the Mining License due to the SSIA\u2019s failure to respond to the MRAM\u2019s queries about Khan\u2019s alleged violations of Mongolian law.330\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 327.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, p. 4.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 317, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 130; Exhibit C-224.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 316-317, referring to Exhibit C-233.\n\n174.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the application of the LPCNEL would have violated Mongolian constitutional principles of property protection as reflected in Articles 8.2, 8.3, and 9 of the Foreign Investment Law.331 According to the Claimants, such principles are violated \"when application of a new public law completely *invalidates* a prior right without compensation,\" even if such principles would not generally be violated by non-discriminatory public laws that affect property rights but do not go so far as \"to detract from the[ir] essence.\"332 Here, the application of the LPCNEL would lead to the invalidation of a prior right without compensation in that this law \"effectively requires the license holders to apply to obtain new rights, which are constituted under a completely different set of terms and conditions than the original ones.\"333\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 329, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 102-112.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 329, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 102-112 (emphasis by the Claimants).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 329, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 102-112 (emphasis by the Claimants).\n\n175.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants submit that the retroactive application of the NEA and the LPCNEL would have violated Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement. According to the Claimants, Article 3.6. of the Founding Agreement, which provides that the \"[p]roperty of the Company will not be the subject of requisition or confiscation,\" allows Mongolia to confiscate CAUC property on the basis solely of the Constitution, and not generally applicable law,334 thus offering broader protection than Article 13 of the ECT, Article 8.2 of the Foreign Investment Law and Article 16.3 of the Constitution.335 The Constitution allows expropriation only if the license rights are used to the detriment of the population\u2019s health, environmental interests or national security,336 which is not the case here.337 The Claimants emphasize that, due to the restrictive phrasing of Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement, even if the NEL and the LPCNEL were based on public policy (which is denied), their application to CAUC would nevertheless be in violation of this provision.338\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 218.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 219.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 335, referring to Exhibit C-16A (art. 3.6), Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 239-241.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 335, referring to Exhibit C-16A (art. 3.6), Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 239-241.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 335, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 241.\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the application of the NEL and the LPCNEL to CAUC and Khan Mongolia would have violated Mongolia\u2019s duty of good faith (as set out in Article 13 of the 2002 Civil Code) and duty of loyalty (as set out in Article 83 of the Company Law) to its partners in the CAUC joint venture. In applying the NEL and the LPCNEL, Mongolia would effectively have used its sovereign power not in the best interest of CAUC, but rather to obtain a favourable commercial position *vis-\u00e0-vis* its partners in the joint venture.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that, not only would the application of the NEL and the LPCNEL to CAUC and Khan Mongolia have violated Mongolia\u2019s obligations under the Agreements as a matter of Mongolian law, but such illegal interference with the Claimants\u2019 contractual rights would also have constituted a violation of international law.339 The Claimants contend that a State can be held internationally liable when it enacts legislation that infringes a foreign investor\u2019s rights that rest on a contract with the State into which the State has entered as \"a Sovereign,\" as is the case here.340\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 337.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 338-340, referring to Exhibit CLA-156, Exhibit CLA-183 (\u00b6 134).\n\n*(ii) The Invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nWhile taking issue with the content of the NEA and the LPCNEL, the Claimants note that these laws were not properly applied to them.341 Nonetheless, the measures taken by Mongolia - in particular, the NEA\u2019s issuance of the Permanent Invalidation Notices and its subsequent refusal to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses under the NEL - realized Mongolia\u2019s intention to expropriate the Claimants\u2019 rights under the licenses and the Agreements. Specifically, Mongolia\u2019s invalidation of and refusal to reinstate the Mining and Exploration Licenses resulted in a total deprivation of these license rights, which, in turn, deprived Khan Resources of its contractual rights under the Agreements to participate in the production of uranium from the Dornod deposits.342\n\nReply, \u00b6 212, referring to Exhibit R-12.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 2.\n\n179.\n\nWith regard to the improper application of the NEL and the LPCNEL, the Claimants submit that while the LPCNEL provided for the revocation of licenses that failed to be re-registered after the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL, it did not authorize the invalidation of licenses before the re-registration deadline of 15 November 2009.343 Yet on 8 October 2009, the NEA issued Order No. 141, revoking all uranium licenses in Mongolia, and the Temporary Invalidation Notices, confirming the effect of Order No. 120 on the Temporary Procedure on Re-Registration and Re-Issuance of the License for Radioactive Minerals **(\"Order No. 120\").344**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 347, referring to Exhibit CLA-142 (arts. 1, 2, 4). *See also* Reply, \u00b6 212.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 346, referring to Exhibits C-2, C-3. *See also* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 214-216, referring to Exhibit R-12 (art. 2), Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6 188, Exhibit CLA-142 (art. 2); Exhibit C-95 (attachment No. 1 of the Order No. 120, arts. 3,4.1).\n\n180.\n\nAs regards the Respondents\u2019 contention that Order No. 141 only had temporary effect and therefore could not amount to a permanent invalidation, the Claimants submit that this temporary measure was in fact given permanent effect by subsequent actions.345\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 2.\n\n181.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants note that the Respondents did not follow the terms of Order No. 141 as regards the NEA\u2019s refusal to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses. Specifically, the Claimants stress that Order No. 141 was a temporary suspension whose terms required the re-registration of licenses pursuant to Order No. 120.346\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 2, referring to Transcript (13 November 2013), 560:2 to 560:18, 633:7 to 636:11, 636:6-11.\n\n182.\n\nAs for the NEA\u2019s notices of 15 December 2010, the Claimants argue that the Notices did not constitute a decision not to re-register the licenses made in application of the NEL, as the Respondents now allege, and note that the Claimants did not in fact receive any decision on their applications for re-registration.347 The Claimants stress that \"there is actually no valid decision by an authorized agent of the Government of Mongolia anywhere in the record of this case that could justify the permanent invalidation of the licenses.\"348 The Claimants submit that the procedure for consideration of license re-registration applications under the NEL was set out in Order No. 120349 and point out that, rather than referring to the NEL, Order No. 141. or Order No. 120, the 15 December 2010 notices mention only the alleged violations of Mongolian law identified in the April 2009 SSIA Report, a requirement that may be taken to fall under the NEL but that only applies to licenses already issued under that law.350 In other words, the Claimants stress, the provision under the NEL on repeated violations of Mongolian law deals not with the re-registration of licenses under the NEL but with the invalidation of licenses already registered therein.351 It is with this argument that the Claimants address the Respondents\u2019 argument that Mongolia\u2019s failure to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses was justified by Article 26.1 of the NEL.352\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 219-220, referring to Exhibits C-8, C-9;

Second, the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses neutralized the Claimants\u2019 investment in the Dornod Project.359 Third, the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses was carried out without due process of law or payment of compensation, and was not based on any legitimate public interest.360 Fourth, the issuance of the Permanent Invalidation Notices was arbitrary, as the decision-making process of the agency was based not on fact but prejudice.361 Fifth, the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses was discriminatory, because the licenses of other business entities that complied with the NEL were reissued, while there is no basis to find that CAUC and Khan Mongolia did not comply with the NEL362 and as CAUC and Khan Mongolia\u2019s license applications were more thorough than those of other companies.363 Because the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses was the outcome of a campaign of conduct that aimed at depriving the Claimants of their participation in the Dornod Project, in order to make way for the Mongolian-Russian joint venture, the Claimants contend that this case is one of direct expropriation in violation of Article 13 of the ECT.364\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 359.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 359, referring to Second Edey Statement, \u00b6 80.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 360, referring to Exhibits C-13, C-14 (p. 3).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 361 (internal citations omitted).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 362.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 365, referring to First Arsenault Statement, \u00b6 89.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 366-367, referring to Exhibit CLA-177 (\u00b6 387).\n\n187.\n\nMoreover, in reliance on the confirmation by the Mongolian administrative courts of the illegality of the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses (discussed in Part V(D) below), the Claimants contend that the NEA\u2019s issuance of the Permanent Invalidation Notices violated the constitutional principles of property protection as reflected in Articles 8.2 and 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law.365 The Claimants argue that the Government must follow due process of law when invalidating property rights (even when such invalidation is legally permissible), which the administrative courts found that Mongolia did not do in the present case.366 The Claimants stress that the Tribunal should accept this finding of the Mongolian courts.367 Specifically, the Claimants contend that Mongolia\u2019s permanent invalidation of and refusal to reinstate the Mining and Exploration Licenses amounted to a *khuraakh,* or a deprivation of property that is carried out as a penalty for breaches of law and not accompanied by compensation, which is prohibited by Article 8.2 of the Foreign Investment Law as well as Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement.368 This is especially in view of how the permanent invalidation of the licenses was not in accordance with the legal procedures for the implementation of the NEL.369 The Claimants also note that the Respondents have not proven that Mongolia\u2019s permanent invalidation of the licenses could be considered a *daichlakh* as in Article 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law, that is, an action that was necessary to protect an urgent public interest and is accompanied by compensation.370\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 357, referring to the Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 69, 167, 176.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 358.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 358, referring to Exhibit CLA-176.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 3.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, p. 3, referring to Transcript (14 November 2013), 691:6-21.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, pp. 2-3.\n\n188.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses violated Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement, which prohibited Mongolia from confiscating CAUC\u2019s property unless required by the Constitution, as would have been the case if CAUC had used its license rights to harm population health, the environment, or national security (see paragraph 175 above). The Claimants argue that, in the present case, CAUC did no such thing, as the NEA based the Permanent Invalidation Notices primarily on baseless allegations of violations of Mongolian law.\n\n189.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that Erdene could and did make a sovereign promise not to confiscate in Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement. The Claimants refer to the Jurisdictional Award to argue that Erdene (predecessor of MonAtom) undertook obligations in both the Founding Agreement and the Minerals Agreement that only a sovereign state could fulfil. The Claimants also explain that State-owned entities operate on behalf of the State, which means that Mongolia, through Erdene, could make the sovereign promise not to confiscate the property of the joint venture. As regards Article 12.3 of the 1995 Minerals Law, on which basis the Founding Agreement was entered, the Claimants interpret this provision to mean that a State, as a commercial participant in a mining venture, will participate on an equal basis with other business partners and shall be subject to civil liability if it fails to meet its commercial commitments. According to the Claimants, therefore, Mongolia\u2019s failure to abide by its sovereign commitment as contained in Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement amounts to a breach of the civil obligation owed to its joint venture partners, thereby triggering civil liability on its part (see paragraphs 112-115 above).\n\n*(iv) Violation of Standards for the Treatment of the Claimants and their Investment*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Mongolia\u2019s permanent invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses violated rules for the treatment of the Claimants and their investments.\n\n191.\n\nFirst, the Claimants submit that the permanent invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses violated Article 8.1 of the Foreign Investment Law, which requires investments to be afforded the \"legal protection guaranteed by the Constitution, this law and other legislation, consistent with those laws and international treaties to which Mongolia is a party.\"371\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 370, referring to Exhibits C-8 (art. 8.1), CLA-138 (art. 4), CLA-26A (art. 46.2), Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 189, 191.\n\n192.\n\nSecond, the Claimants submit that the permanent invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses violated Mongolia\u2019s obligation under Article 10.1 of the ECT to accord Khan Netherlands\u2019 investment treatment no less favourable than that required by international law. According to the Claimants, the invalidation of the licenses was arbitrary, undertaken without the benefit of a rational decision-making process, and motivated by overt prejudice.372\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 375, referring to Exhibits CLA-53 (art. 10.1), C-102 (p. 3), CLA-122 (p. 446), CLA-196 (\u00b6 98).\n\n193.\n\nThird, the Claimants contend that the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses breached Mongolia\u2019s obligation under Article 10.1 to provide the investments of Khan Netherlands with fair and equitable treatment, in that Mongolia used its sovereign authority to benefit itself at the expense of the Claimants, rather than honouring its obligations under the Agreements.373 The Claimants reject the contention that they cannot claim protection for what the Respondents characterize as an imprudent investment374 by referring to the specific assurances made by Mongolia in its international investment agreement with the Claimants -the Minerals Agreement.375\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 377, referring to Exhibit CLA-53 (art. 10.1).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 200-202, referring to Exhibits C-17A (arts. 1.1, 4.3, 11.1, 12.1, 12.2, 16.1), C-17C, CLA-46, (art. 81.2), C-117 (art. 13), C-16A (art. 3.6).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 200-202, referring to Exhibits C-17A (arts. 1.1, 4.3, 11.1, 12.1, 12.2, 16.1), C-17C, CLA-46 (art. 81.2), C-117 (art. 13), C-16A (art. 3.6).\n\n194.\n\nFourth, the Claimants submit that Mongolia violated its commitments under Article 9 of the Foreign Investment Law and Article 10.7 of the ECT to accord the relevant investors (all of the Claimants under the Foreign Investment Law, and Khan Netherlands under the ECT) treatment no less favourable than that accorded to Mongolian investors and their investments, because of the *prima facie* evidence that the NEA re-registered the radioactive minerals licenses of many other companies, despite Khan being in a better position to meet the legal requirements for the re-registration.\n\n195.\n\nFifth, the Claimants submit that Mongolia\u2019s breach of Articles 8.1 and 9 of the Foreign Investment Law also constitutes a breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT, as this provision states that the host State shall \"observe any obligations it has entered into\" with an investor.\n\n196.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that Mongolia violated its obligations under the Agreements and Article 81.2 of the Company Law by failing to act in good faith towards its joint venture partners and in the best interests of CAUC. The Claimants further contend that, in light of its duty of loyalty, Mongolia was in fact obligated to use its sovereign powers to further the interests of the CAUC joint venture.\n\n*The Respondents\u2019 position*\n---------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Respondents contend that neither the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL nor the permanent invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses breached any obligations owed by the Respondents to the Claimants or were enacted to target the Claimants specifically. Arguing that the Mining and Exploration Licenses were invalidated through the proper application of the NEL and the LPCNEL, the Respondents do not differentiate (as do the Claimants) between the effects of the potential and actual application of these laws.\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondents submit that Mongolia enacted the NEL and the LPCNEL in an exercise of its sovereignty in the uranium industry, which was both potentially profitable and potentially detrimental to the environment.376 The Respondents contend that the application of the NEL served the public purpose of providing a comprehensive regulatory regime for the exploitation of radioactive materials and nuclear energy in a manner that adhered to both national and international standards and that ultimately protected human health and the environment.377\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 241-243, referring to First Munkhtamir Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 28, First Bailikhuu Report, \u00b6 14.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 193-197,

transparent manner, given that: the International Atomic Energy Agency (\"IAEA\") assisted in its drafting;378 drafts were transmitted to Khan;379 and a draft was published in the May 2009 edition of

required all uranium mining or exploration licenses to be re-registered.381 By Order No. 141, the NEA ordered all such licenses to be invalidated in October 2009, pending their re-registration; in the Temporary Invalidation Notices, the NEA requested CAUC and Khan Mongolia to suspend the relevant activity pending re-registration of the Mining and Exploration Licenses.382\n\nStatement of Defence,

the allegedly \"retroactive\" application of the NEL, and clarify that \"[t]he NEL applied to existing license holders but applied to their activities prospectively.\"385 The Respondents note that the real question is whether this regulatory change breached any obligation that the Respondents owed the Claimants, and contend that this question should be answered in the negative.386\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 100.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 100.\n\n203.\n\nAmong the features of the NEL that are relevant to license-holders are the following: (i)the obligation to comply with the general requirements set out in Article 16.3, such as the requirement to abide by Mongolian legislation and relevant standards and to use technology that is not harmful to human health and the environment;387 (ii) the NEA\u2019s discretion in view of Article 16.3.1 to base its decision on the re-registration of licenses partly on an applicant\u2019s history of compliance with Mongolian law;388 (iii) the license-holder\u2019s obligation to comply with the conditions specified in Article 17.2, as applicable to licenses for exploring for radioactive materials;389 and (iv) the obligation to comply with the conditions specified in Article 17.3, as applicable to the license for exploiting radioactive materials.390\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 275, referring to ExhibitR-11 (arts. 16.3.1, 16.3.2).\n\nStatement of

5,391\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 191.\n\n205.\n\nThe Respondents allege that the implementation of the NEL triggered a further SSIA inspection,392 which revealed that the breaches identified in the April 2009 SSIA Inspection Report had not yet been remedied.393 Because the NEL requires license-holders to comply with Mongolian law, the Respondents note that the results of the SSIA inspection required the NEA to confirm the decision not to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses.394 The Respondents also highlight the SSIA Inspections of 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2010, all of which had found that the Claimants had breached Mongolian law on several occasions.395 The Respondents allege that the NEA\u2019s notices nos. 4/1401 and 4/1402 issued on 15 December 2010 clearly stated that the Mining and Exploration Licenses could not be re-registered because CAUC and Khan Mongolia had not satisfied the requirements of the NEL396 and that these notices also recalled the administrative process regarding the re-registration of the licenses under the NEL.397 The Respondents also note, specifically, that these notifications indicated that the Mining and Exploration Licenses could not be re-registered because of the repeated breaches by CAUC and Khan Mongolia of Mongolian law.398 The Respondents further contend that the decision of the NEA complied with Articles 26.1 and 26.1.3 of the NEL, which required the revocation of licenses that did not comply with the terms and conditions of the licenses.399 They also highlight that Khan Mongolia and CAUC should have and could have, but did not, challenge these notifications before the Mongolian administrative courts.400\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 277, referring to Exhibit C-94.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 277, referring to

the MRAM of the dispute relating to the suspension of the Mining License, the Respondents note that the 2010 SSIA inspection, which revealed that some breaches had not been remedied and that others had been committed took place after the settlement.401\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 287, referring to Memorial, \u00b6 350, Exhibit C-94.\n\n207.\n\nThe Respondents\u2019 response to the Claimants\u2019 specific claims of breaches of Mongolian and international law is set out below.\n\n*(i) Expropriation and Other Violations Related to Property*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nThe Respondents submit that Mongolia\u2019s application of the NEL and the LPCNEL to the Mining and Exploration Licenses does not amount to an expropriation under international law.\n\n209.\n\nThe Respondents argue that international law does not oblige States to compensate foreign investors for the enactment of non-discriminatory *bona fide* regulations that pursue a legitimate purpose.402 The Respondents stress that Mongolia has the right of permanent sovereignty over its natural resources.403 International law recognises the right of the State to regulate its energy sector404 and thereby accords Mongolia significant discretion in how it regulates the exploitation of its mineral wealth.405\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 250-251, referring to Exhibits CLA-187 (\u00b6 255), RL-104 (\u00b6 139). *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 201.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6

(art. 3l(3)(c)).\n\n210.\n\nMoreover, observing that international law grants States significant latitude in how they define a public purpose,406 the Respondents contend that the NEL promotes the public purpose of addressing the insufficiency of the legal framework regulating uranium mining407 According to the Respondents, the NEL was, in other words, specifically intended \"to establish a legal framework in [the uranium industry] which could enable [Mongolia] to monitor its resources and reach its objectives in accordance with international practice and safety standards.\"408\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 252, referring to the Memorial, \u00b6 322, Exhibits RL-113 (\u00b6 10.3.34) (quotation omitted), RL-ll4(p. 179).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 253, referring to First Munkhtamir Statement, \u00b6 16.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 254, referring to First Bailikhuu Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15.\n\n211.\n\nThe Respondents then contend that both the NEL and LPCNEL were applied in a non-discriminatory manner. First, the NEL was intended not to oust Khan from the Dornod region but to attract investors from countries other than China and Russia.409 Second, the NEL and LPCNEL applied in the same way to all uranium license-holders in Mongolia.410 The non-discriminatory application of the NEL was confirmed by the 13 October 2009 decision of the Administrative Appellate Court.411\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 256, referring to Memorial, \u00b6 316, First Bailikhuu Statement, \u00b6 16.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 257, referring to Exhibit CLA-142 (arts. 1, 2).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 258, referring to Exhibit C-14 (p. 6).\n\n212.\n\nThe Respondents note that the NEA did not treat CAUC or Khan Mongolia in a discriminatory manner, and highlight that 165 licenses were cancelled and 49 were not re-registered.412 Moreover, six licenses were invalidated on the basis of Order No. 141413\n\nRespondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 32.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 26, referring to Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 6, Exhibit R-88.\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondents also clarify that the NEL did not result in the permanent invalidation of minerals licenses, but only in their temporary invalidation, pending re-registration after the fulfilment of legitimate requirements.414 Such a temporary invalidation cannot amount to an expropriation.415\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 259, referring to Memorial, \u00b6 328.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 259.\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondents explain that the application of the NEL to existing license-holders was necessary in order to avoid a two-track system, in which different regulatory regimes would apply to license-holders, depending on whether such entities received their licenses before or after the enactment of the NEL416\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 201.\n\n215.\n\nTo address the Claimants\u2019 argument that an expropriation occurs whenever the rights of an investor are replaced by less favourable rights, the Respondents observe that an investor may be said to have less favourable rights whenever a State pursues the public interest through the enactment of legislation417\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 260, referring to Memorial, \u00b6 328.\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the application of the NEL does not amount to a breach of property rights under Mongolian law, relying on the 13 December 2009 decision of the Mongolian Constitutional Court, which confirmed the constitutionality of the NEL provisions authorizing State ownership in mineral exploration works.418 This decision referred to Article 6.2 of the Constitution, which assigns property rights over \"the subsoil with its mineral resources\" to the State,419 and confirmed the competence of the State Great Khural to determine the requirements for and the percentage of State ownership in mineral exploration projects.420 The Mongolian Constitutional Court also found that the NEL did not breach the principles of justice, equality and rule of law, as well as property rights \"consistent with universal trends of world economic development,\"421 Mongolia\u2019s obligation under Article 10.2 of the Constitution to fulfil its international treaty obligations,422 or the provisions regarding expropriation under Mongolian constitutional law.423\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 247, referring to Exhibit C-237.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 248, referring to Exhibit C-237.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 248, referring to Exhibit C-237.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 248, referring to Exhibit C-237.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 248.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 248, referring to Exhibit C-237.\n\n217.\n\nThe Respondents further submit that Mongolia did not breach Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement. The Respondents explain that the Founding Agreement was entered into on the basis of Article 12 of the 1995 Minerals Law, and contend that this provision did not authorize Mongol Erdene to make the sovereign promise not to confiscate on behalf of Mongolia424\n\nSpecifically, Article 12.3 of the 1995 Minerals Law states that \"[t]he obligations of the Government in respect of its participation in the exploration for or mining of minerals shall be performed through a business entity with State participation, and in that case that entity shall have the same rights and obligations as other participating business entities.\" Viewed in this light, Article 3.6 merely requires the parties to the Founding Agreement to treat the common property of CAUC with the same equal regard for the purpose of the joint venture. Statement of Defence, \u00b6 294, ciring First Bayar Report, \u00b6 31. Article 3.6 also assigns the parties equal rights, meaning that Erdene could hold only those rights that the other parties to the joint venture had. That neither of the other entities (namely, Priargunsky and WM Mining) could make a sovereign promise is uncontested. The creation by the Founding Agreement of a civil legal relationship means, therefore, that Mongolia did not make a sovereign promise not to confiscate. Statement of Defence, \u00b6 295.\n\n218.\n\nIf the Tribunal finds that Article 3.6 contains a sovereign promise, the Respondents make the alternative argument that this article is void under Mongolian law, because Mongolian law does not authorize the state-owned entity to exercise rights belonging to a State.\n\n219.\n\nBut even were Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement found not to be void under Mongolian law, the Respondents contend that they did not breach this provision. Specifically, the Respondents note that Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement prohibits \"bituumjlekh\" (freezing or sealing) and \"khuraakh\" (seizure of property by authority of law as penalty or sanctions for unlawful conduct). There was no \"bituumjlekh\" in this case, as the Mining License was invalidated on the basis of Order No. 141 and a decision made not to re-register it was made because CAUC did not comply with the requirements of the NEL for holding a license. As well, there was no \"khuraakh\" in this case because the Mining and Exploration Licenses do not constitute property under Mongolian law (see paragraphs 123-124 above) and were invalidated pursuant to a law that applied to all radioactive minerals license holders.\n\n220.\n\nThe Respondents highlight the fact that the Founding and Minerals Agreements contain no promise of legal stability, which makes them subject to the evolving legal framework in Mongolia.\n\n*(ii) Violation of Standards for the Treatment of the Claimants and their Investment*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe Respondents reject the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the revocation of the Exploration License breached the fair and equitable treatment standard provided in Article 10 of the ECT on the basis that the enactment of the NEL and LPCEL did not violate the legitimate expectations of the Claimants, if any.\n\n222.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the Claimants\u2019 allegation that Mongolia conspired to exclude Khan from the CAUC joint venture is unsupported by the factual record.425 The Respondents also reject the Claimants\u2019 contention that Mongolia failed to act transparently in the implementation of the NEL, by stressing the assistance of the IAEA in the development of this law, the consultation with stakeholders, and the communication of various drafts of the NEL to Khan426 They highlight the current dormancy of the Dornod Project to show that the Respondents did not intend to develop the project for their own benefit427\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 315-316.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 315-316.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 315-316.\n\n223.\n\nIn connection with the Respondents\u2019 response to the Claimants\u2019 claims on property, the Respondents further argue that the regulatory authority of the State negates the expectation that the legal framework of the State is to be frozen for the entire investment period, absent a specific guarantee.428 Neither the fair and equitable treatment standard nor the international minimum standard for the treatment of aliens prohibits a State from modifying its legal framework429\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 260-261, referring to Exhibits RL-115 (\u00b6 103), RL-116 (vol. 1, section 712, comment g).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 261, referring to Exhibit CLA-50 (\u00b6\u00b6 335-338). The Respondents also highlight the recognition of other tribunals in investment treaty arbitrations of the likelihood that States in democratic transition like Mongolia will enact legislative changes. Statement of Defence, \u00b6 262, referring to Exhibit CLA-172 (\u00b6 368).\n\n224.\n\nThe Respondents then contend that investment treaties do not insure against business risk, which should be considered by and is ultimately borne by the investor430 The Respondents note that Mongolia was undergoing rapid economic and legal changes during the execution of the Agreements and the issuance of the Exploration License, and they contend that this situation would have led any reasonable investor to expect an evolving legal framework in Mongolia.431 The Respondents argue that this awareness on the part of Khan, as well as the legal significance of such awareness, negates the Claimants\u2019 argument that the enactment of the NEL and LPCNEL violated the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations and breached the fair and equitable treatment standard.432\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 263, referring to Exhibit RL-118 (\u00b6 178). The Respondents note that this business risk is always contextualized by the economic conditions and overall circumstances of a State. Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 264-265, referring to Exhibit RL-95 (\u00b6\u00b6 65(b), 75). The Respondents also discuss and rely on *Bayindir v. Pakistan,* in particular, where the tribunal considered the fair and equitable treatment claim of Bayindir and found that Pakistan had not frustrated the legitimate expectations of Bayindir because it could not have ignored the volatile political conditions in Pakistan at the time it renewed the relevant contract. Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 266-268, referring to Exhibit RL-99 (\u00b6\u00b6 192-193).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 269. The Respondents contend that Khan was in fact aware of this situation by referring to its 2008 Annual Information Report which referred to \"risks of political instability and changes in government policies, laws and regulations,\" \"changes in regulations or shifts in political conditions,\" and \"[the] regulatory environment [being] in a state of continuing change,\" among other similar references. Statement of Defence, \u00b6 270, referring to Exhibit R-71 (pp. 23-24).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 271.\n\n225.\n\nThe Respondents further reject the Claimants\u2019 argument that the invalidation of the Exploration License breached the guarantee in Article 10.1 of the ECT that Mongolia not subject the investment of Khan Netherlands to impairment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures,433 which has been defined as \"something done capriciously, without reason.\"434 The Respondents stress that the actions of Mongolia were neither \"capricious\" nor \"without reason.\"435\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 309, referring to Memorial, \u00b6 371.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 309, referring to Exhibit RL-121 (\u00b6 197).\n\nAs the Respondents argue, first, both the NEL and LPCNEL pursued the legitimate purpose of enabling Mongolia to take advantage of its radioactive mineral wealth through the modernisation of its regulatory regime. Second, the decision of the NEA not to re-register the Mining and Exploration License was based on serious and repeated breaches of Mongolian law. Third, the NEA revoked all existing uranium licenses pending their re-registration, such that the revocation of the Exploration License was not discriminatory. Statement of Defence, \u00b6 310.\n\n226.\n\nThe Respondents reject the Claimants\u2019 claim of breach of Article 10.7 of the ECT, a claim which they characterize as \"a discrimination claim [based on treatment to be provided to the new Russian-Mongolian joint venture] in the guise of a claim for breach of the MFN clause in Article 10.7 of the ECT.\"436 The Respondents explain that Mongolia and Russia have signed an agreement that contemplates the formation of \"a joint venture to exploit uranium resources in Mongolia,\"437 which has not yet been established, thereby rendering the Claimants\u2019 argument speculative.438 In addition, the agreement between Russia and Mongolia foresees the participation of third parties and provides for the protection of existing rights.439 In fact, Mongolia does not afford Russian investors more favourable treatment than Dutch investors, and is, therefore, not in breach of Article 10.7.440\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 311, referring to Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 226, 372-373.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 312, referring to First Bailikhuu Report, \u00b6 21.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 312, referring to First Bailikhuu Report, \u00b6 21.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 312.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 313-314, referring to Exhibit RL-122 (p. 206).\n\n227.\n\nThe Respondents reject the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Respondents breached their obligations of good faith and loyalty under the Company Law and 2002 Civil Code by contending that the 2002 Civil Code does not apply to relationships involving administrative subordination, which they allege is the case here (see paragraph 123). Because the 2002 Civil Code does not apply to the Mining and Exploration Licenses, the Respondents further contend that these licenses do not constitute \"property\" for the purposes of Mongolian law (see paragraphs 123-124). The Respondents also argue that the duty of loyalty applies only to MonAtom, as the Company Law imposes this duty only on those who have a 20 percent or greater shareholding in a company.441 The Respondents contend, accordingly, that the duties of good faith and loyalty could not have obliged Mongolia to exercise its administrative discretion in favour of CAUC.442\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 300, referring to Exhibit CLA-46 (art. 81.6).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 149, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 215, First Bayar Report, \u00b6\u00b6 116-117.\n\n228.\n\nBut even were the 2002 Civil Code and Company Law to apply to Mongolia, the Respondents contend that neither of these \"prevent[s] Mongolia from implementing a general, non-discriminatory measure that pursues a legitimate public interest, such as the NEL and Order No. 141 \"443 and that Mongolia has not, therefore, breached the duty of good faith and loyalty under Mongolian law.\n\nRespondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 59.\n\n229.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the Respondents breached Article 8.1 of the Foreign Investment Law, which accords foreign investment the legal protection of the Constitution, the Foreign Investment Law and other legislation consistent with laws and international treaties444 and guarantees foreign investors access to the Mongolian legal system for the enforcement of their rights,445 the Respondents reiterate that the NEA\u2019s actions complied with Mongolian law and international law.446\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 302, referring to Exhibit CLA-8 (art. 8.1).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 303, referring to First Bayar Report, \u00b6 120.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 304.\n\n230.\n\nAs regards the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the Respondents breached Article 9 of the Foreign Investment Law, which obliges Mongolia to accord foreign investors conditions that are no less favourable than those accorded to Mongolian investors in respect of their investments, the Respondents note that the NEL and the LPCNEL applied to both Mongolian and non-Mongolian investors and that Order No. 141 also applied to all license-holders without distinction.\n\n**E. The Decisions of Mongolia\u2019s Administrative Courts**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimants\u2019 position*\n-------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimants allege that, in its Decision No. 325 of 19 July 2010 and Decision No. 340 of 2 August 2010, the Administrative Court found the Temporary Invalidation Notices and the Permanent Invalidation Notices to be void.447 As regards Decision No. 340, the Claimants note that this decision was binding between the parties because the parties did not appeal it.448\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 148, referring to Exhibits C-13 (p. 7), R-25 (pp. 30-31).\n\nTranscript (13 November 2013), 558:20 to 559:12.\n\n232.\n\nIn its Decision No. 374 of 13 October 2010, the Administrative Appellate Court confirmed the holding in Decision No. 325 in respect of the notices addressed to CAUC.449 As regards Decision No. 374, the Claimants also clarified that the administrative appellate courts in Mongolia do not have the authority to issue binding interpretations of Mongolian law, which only the Mongolian Supreme Court can do, meaning that the decisions they issue determine the interpretations only between the parties to the judicial proceeding450 The Claimants also note that Decision No. 374 does not have an effect on the finality of Decision No. 340, as the claimants in these proceedings were different451 Because of this, the Claimants contend that Decision No. 374 had no effect on the validity of Order No. 141452\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 149, referring to Exhibit C-14/R-27, Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 54.\n\nTranscript (13 November 2013), 557:18 to 558:19.\n\nTranscript (13 November 2013), 559:13-24.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 8.\n\n233.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the effect of these decisions was to make it as if the Claimants\u2019 licenses had never been invalidated453\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 386, referring to Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 181-183.\n\n234.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the NEA should have therefore considered CAUC and Khan Mongolia\u2019s applications for the re-registration of the Mining and Exploration Licenses and issued a decision conforming with the LPCNEL, Order No. 141 and Order No. 120454 Instead, the NEA continued to act as if the Permanent Invalidation Notices were administrative acts with legal effect455 by issuing, first, on 11 November 2010, a declaration in the Mongolian press stating that the Mining and Exploration Licenses could not be reinstated and mentioning alleged legal violations related to these,456 and then, on 10 December 2010, individual notifications to CAUC and Khan Mongolia, stating that their licenses had not been reinstated \"since your company has not satisfied the conditions and requirements of the law.\"457\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 387-388, referring to Exhibits C-13 (p. 6), R-25 (p. 12);

The latter responsibility arises by virtue of law, not of any court decision463 Stated differently, the obligation of the NEA to consider and issue a \"well-founded decision\" on CAUC and Khan Mongolia\u2019s license re-registration applications arose by virtue of the LPCNEL464\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 233-234.\n\nReply, \u00b6 234.\n\n239.\n\nAs regards the Respondents\u2019 emphasis on the Claimants not having challenged the NEA letters of 15 December 2010 before the Mongolian administrative courts, the Claimants note that the availability of a domestic administrative challenge procedure does not affect the right of Khan to challenge a confiscatory action before an international tribunal.465\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, p. 8.\n\n*The Respondents\u2019 position*\n---------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the decisions of the Mongolian administrative courts had no bearing on the NEA\u2019s decision not to register the Mining and Exploration Licenses under the NEL.466\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 324.\n\n241.\n\nThe Respondents note that the decisions of the Administrative Court in Decision No. 325 and Decision No. 340 finding the notifications as regards the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses invalid were based on purely procedural grounds.467\n\nRespondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 33.\n\n242.\n\nFirst, the Administrative Appellate Court, in Decision No. 325, actually upheld the validity of Order No. 141, which revoked all uranium licenses in Mongolia pending their re-registration under the NEL468 The Court decided \"to dismiss the claim having order No. 141 by the head of Nuclear Energy Agency in 2009 recognized as illegal and to make modifications to the resolution of first instance court.\"469 After this decision, therefore, the Mining and Exploration Licenses remained invalidated pending their re-registration470\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 304, 325, referring to Exhibits C-14 (p. 6), R-12, First Bayar Report, \u00b6 122.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 325, referring to Exhibit C-14 (p. 6).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 326.\n\n243.\n\nSecond, because in the proceedings before the Mongolian courts CAUC and Khan Mongolia did not claim that they had a right to the reinstatement of the Mining and Exploration Licenses,471 the decisions of these courts could not have obliged the NEA to reinstate them472 And, in fact, the Administrative Court held that \"in the future it shall be noted that this judicial decision does not have any restriction on the decision regarding re-registration of the Mining License No. 237A [...],\" thus clarifying that its decision was unrelated to the NEA\u2019s decision on the re-registration.473\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 327, referring to Exhibit R-65.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 329; Respondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 33.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 328, referring to Exhibit R-25 (p. 14).\n\n244.\n\nIn not reinstating the Mining and Exploration Licenses, the NEA therefore did not ignore any decisions of the Mongolian courts. Moreover, the NEA\u2019s decision was justified, as Khan Mongolia and CAUC continued to violate Mongolian laws and regulations (as was noted during the March 2010 SSIA inspection)474 In fact, in the administrative proceedings in Mongolia, CAUC and Khan Mongolia did not challenge the grounds on which the NEA decided not to re-register their licenses.475\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 330-331, referring to First Bayar Report, \u00b6\u00b6 112-113.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 332.\n\n245.\n\nAccordingly, Mongolia did not violate Article 8.1 of the Foreign Investment Law and the Claimants cannot bring a claim for the denial of justice.476 That Khan Mongolia and CAUC were able to commence proceedings before the Mongolian courts and were in fact successful in their challenges to the Temporary Invalidation Notices and the Permanent Invalidation Notices further proves that there was no breach of Article 8.1 of the Foreign Investment Law.477\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 332.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 304, referring to First Bayar Report, \u00b6 122.\n\n246.\n\nNor, in refusing to reinstate the Mining and Exploration Licenses, did the Respondents breach the international minimum standard for the treatment of aliens. According to the Respondents, this standard is breached by \"treatment of an alien... [that] amount[s] to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.\"478 The Respondents first contend that, in the present case, the actions of Mongolia cannot be considered arbitrary. The NEL and the LPCNEL were valid exercises of Mongolia\u2019s permanent sovereignty over its natural resources and pursued a legitimate purpose.479 In addition, the NEA\u2019s decision not to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses was taken after a series of actions involving site inspections and discussions with the Claimants.480 Second, the due process offered by Mongolia to the Claimants satisfied the international minimum standard, in that the Claimants were afforded the opportunity to challenge the administrative decisions in the Mongolian courts (which they did, successfully in some instances).481 The Respondents point out that it is the Claimants who chose not to challenge the NEA\u2019s decision not to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses in the Mongolian courts.482 Finally, Mongolia did not discriminate against either Khan Mongolia or CAUC, in that Order No. 141 applied to all uranium mining and exploration license-holders without discrimination483\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 318-319, referring to Exhibits CLA-179 (\u00b6 4), RL-123 (\u00b6 616).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 320.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 320.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 321.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 321.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 322, referring to Exhibits R-12, C-14.\n\n**F. The Alleged Manipulation of the Media**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimants\u2019 position*\n-------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the public statements made by Mongolia about Khan - which they characterize as revealing the autocratic tendencies of the Government - not only evince that other conduct by Mongolia toward the Claimants has been arbitrary and discriminatory, but also constitute an instance of wrongful conduct.484\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 398.\n\n248.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants contend that some of the statements made by Government officials - such as: \"[t]hese small Canadian companies intending to take activities in Mongolia have done cheating. We are watching the small Canadian companies through a loop. Provided they breach our law, we shall confiscate their licenses straight away\"485 and \"[t]he management of Khan Resources is probably the li[a]rs \"486 - amount to illegal defamation, for which the administrative bodies that employ these officials, or the State, could be held liable pursuant to Article 498.2 of the 2002 Civil Code,487 and for which the Claimants should, therefore, be able to claim damages.488\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 400, referring to Exhibit C-102 (emphasis by the Claimants).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 400, referring to Exhibit C-106 (emphasis by the Claimants).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 399, referring to Exhibit CLA-117 (art. 498.2).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 400, referring to Exhibits C-100, C-101, C-102, C-70, C-106, C-224; Reply, \u00b6 332, referring to Exhibits C-100, C-106, C-224, C-475, C-476, C-477, C-469, C-7.\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimants note that the status of Khan Canada as a publicly traded company in Canada obliges it to publish information for the benefit of its shareholders and potential investors about material events that affect its investments in Mongolia, but argue that, contrary to the Respondents\u2019 assertions, Khan Canada\u2019s press releases are neutral and are not, in any case, adversely targeted toward the Respondents.489\n\nReply, \u00b6 331, referring to Exhibit C-208.\n\n*The Respondents\u2019 position*\n---------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondents submit that, to the contrary, it is the Claimants that have exerted pressure on the Respondents by regularly releasing erroneous and biased updates regarding the present arbitration in the international media.490 In fact, according to the Respondents, the Claimants have been making aggressive public declarations and false allegations against Mongolia since the latter announced its plan to enact a legal framework for its nuclear sector491\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 342-345, referring to Exhibits R-70, R-73, C-170; Statement of Defence, \u00b6 345 n. 422, referring to Exhibit C-69.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 344.\n\n251.\n\nThe Respondents argue that Mongolia has refrained from responding to these allegations publicly, and note that the Claimants\u2019 allegations to the contrary are based on interviews conducted with a single NEA representative, who responded to Khan\u2019s \"incorrect\" public statements only because he was confronted by them.492\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 348, referring to Exhibit C-69 as an example.\n\n**VI. THE PARTIES\u2019 ARGUMENTS ON DAMAGES**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**A. Standard of Damages**\n--------------------------\n\n*The Claimants\u2019 position*\n-------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Claimants assert that their entitlement to damages is governed by the ECT, Mongolian law and customary international law.493 The ECT directs the Tribunal to apply both the provisions of the ECT and the \"applicable rules and principles of international law.\"494 Similarly, while the Founding Agreement states that it is to be interpreted in accordance with Mongolian laws, the Constitution and 2002 Civil Code confirm that Mongolian law must be interpreted in accordance with international law.495 Accordingly, any award of damages, whether under the ECT or Mongolian law, should adhere to the relevant norms and principles of international law.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 412.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 413, referring to Exhibit CLA-53 (arts. 26(6), 10(1)).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 414, referring to Exhibits C-16A (art. 12.1), CLA-26 (art. 10(1)), CLA-117 (art. 540.1).\n\n253.\n\nThe Claimants submit that compensation for damages under Mongolian law, whether with respect to breach of obligations arising under the Agreements, wrongful administrative acts or breach of civil obligations (such as those under the Foreign Investment Law and the Company Law), should aim to put the Claimants in the position they would have been in had the Agreements been properly performed and had the Mining and Exploration Licenses not been illegally invalidated496 The Claimants rely, in support, on Articles 227, 229, 497.1 and 498.2 of the 2002 Civil Code and Article 16.14 of the Constitution497\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 417-420; Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 23.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 416, referring to Exhibits CLA-26 (art. 16.14), CLA-117 (art. 497.1); Claimants\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 92.\n\n254.\n\nAs for the standard of compensation for Mongolia\u2019s illegal expropriation of the Claimants\u2019 investment in breach of the ECT, the Foreign Investment Law and the Founding Agreement, the Claimants submit that it is to be found in the general principles of damages under customary international law.498 This is because neither the ECT nor Mongolian law provide a standard for assessing compensation for unlawful expropriation499\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 424.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 423.\n\n255.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the applicable customary international law standard of compensation for unlawful expropriation, set out in the *Case concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w*  ***(\"Chorz\u00f3w Factory\")*** and confirmed by the Draft Articles of the International Law Commission on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts **(\"ILC Articles\"),** is that the Tribunal should aim to put the claimant in the position it would have been in had the investment not been expropriated.500\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 425-426, referring to *Case concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germany v.

Neither international nor Mongolian law require compensation to be limited to the actual investment.529 As for the Claimants\u2019 estimate of costs expended on the Dornod Project,530 Mr. Edey\u2019s evaluation of USD 50 million is conservative and consistent with the Claimants\u2019 prior statements.531 The evaluation is based on audited financial statements, which represents the most widely accepted evidence of expenditures linked to investments.532\n\nReply, \u00b6 400.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 402-409;

Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 222-244; Respondents\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 97.\n\n267.\n\nShould the Tribunal determine that damages are due to the Claimants, these damages should be limited to the amount that the Claimants actually invested in the Dornod Project - that is, **USD 16.7 million.**540\n\nRespondents\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 98, 102, 116; Respondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 119.\n\n268.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondents argue that the Claimants have exaggerated the amount they claim to have invested by including: amounts made by Mr. Mays and other predecessors in interest; USD 1.7 million for foreign exchange losses that were not realized; USD 11.1 million for stock-based compensation for management; USD 11.9 million for general corporate expenses (even though Khan pursued other projects); USD 1.6 for a failed attempt to acquire Western Prospector;541 and legal fees and settlements arising from litigation unrelated to the Dornod Project.542\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 399; Rejoinder, \u00b6 254; Respondents\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 99.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 255.\n\n269.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondents argue that the value of the Claimants\u2019 investment should be calculated by reference to the share price of Khan Canada as at the Valuation Date, which, according to the Respondents\u2019 expert Mr. John Lagerberg, would amount to **between USD 13.4 and USD 18.6 million.543** In support of this valuation, the Respondents note that CNNC\u2019s USD 39 million offer \"was deemed by Khan itself to be a good offer for the business, and that secondly it was at an inflated, as opposed to a fair market value.\"544\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 470; Respondents\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 103-107; Respondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 120-126.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 57.\n\n270.\n\nThe Respondents argue that, as on the Valuation Date, Khan Canada, a publicly-traded company, held all of the Claimants\u2019 interests, the Claimants\u2019 claim cannot exceed the value of this company.545 And, as stated in *RosInvestCo v. Russia,*546 the best evidence of fair value for a publicly-traded company is its quoted share price in an active market.547 The Claimants\u2019 argument that the share value of Khan Canada as it was in 2007 - two years before the alleged expropriation - should be used is without a legal548 or factual549 basis, designed to inflate damages by profiting from the \"uranium bubble\" of 2007,550 and contrary to the value of the Claimants\u2019 expenditures.551 At the hearing, comparing Khan Canada\u2019s share price against peer group prices, the Respondents\u2019 expert Behre Dolbear observed that the 2007 \"dip in Khan\u2019s price purportedly caused by the actions of the Mongolian government [follows] that same drop in the peer group prices that weren\u2019t affected by the Mongolian government.\"552\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 443.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 262-263, referring to Exhibit RL-156 (\u00b6 675).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 444.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 267-277;

Respondents\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 129.\n\n274.\n\nThe Respondents submit that, in any event, the Claimants\u2019 application of the DCF method is flawed, because it does not properly reflect the specific political, business and execution risks of Khan Canada\u2019s ability to finance and develop the Dornod Project,566 relies on tax incentive calculations based on long-abolished Mongolian foreign investment laws, uses a 19-year forecast for the price of uranium (despite the limited certainty of uranium price forecasting beyond three years), and assumes a joint operation of the Main Property and the Additional Property with the adjacent Gurvanbulag mine owned by Western Prospector, which had rejected the Claimants\u2019 merger offer in 2008.567 As put by Respondents\u2019 expert John Lagerberg, the DCF method distorts Khan Canada\u2019s economic value because \"[t]he market would give you credit if you are about to get your hands on [financing] more than if that cash is many years and many hurdles away.\"568 Should the Tribunal, contrary to Respondents\u2019 submissions, decide to apply the DCF method, it should rely on Mr. Lagerberg\u2019s DCF calculation of USD 29.1 million.569\n\nRespondents\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 60.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 392-393;

THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS ON LIABILITY**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nThe Claimants in this arbitration have brought their claims against the Respondents on multiple legal bases, which are listed at paragraphs 105-106 above. The Tribunal has considered the Parties\u2019 arguments in relation to each of the legal bases invoked by the Claimants in full. However, for the purposes of this award, the Tribunal will address only those legal bases and arguments that are necessary to reach the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on liability and damages.\n\n**A. The Alleged Unity of Investment**\n--------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Tribunal first addresses the question of the alleged \"unity of investment,\" that is, the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Mining and Exploration Licenses are to be viewed as a single investment, such that the impairment of rights conferred under one License would also constitute an impairment of rights under the other License.\n\n289.\n\nWhether there was a \"unity of investment\" matters for the purposes of determining liability and damages. For example, the Claimants have argued that, if the Mining and Exploration Licenses are viewed as one investment, then, although the Exploration License is held by Khan Mongolia, an entity that is not a party to the Founding Agreement, it would suffice for the Claimants to demonstrate that the Respondents breached Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement to establish liability in respect of both licenses.597 In addition, if liability is found and the Mining and Exploration Licenses are viewed as one investment, then damages will have to be assessed on the basis of the value of a single Dornod Project comprising both licenses.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 176-181, 368-369; Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, pp. 16-17.\n\n290.\n\nThe Claimants submit that their intention to merge the Mining and Exploration Licenses and the informal discussions held in that regard with the partners to the CAUC joint venture suffice to connect the two Licenses for the purposes of this arbitration. The Claimants assert that the joint venture would not have been viable without the Additional Property covered by the Exploration License.598 Conversely, the Respondents contend that since the Claimants took no steps to merge the Mining and Exploration Licenses, the Tribunal should not treat the Exploration License as part of the CAUC joint venture.599\n\n*See* paragraphs 130-136 above.\n\n*See* paragraphs 137-143 above.\n\n291.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Mining and Exploration Licenses must be treated separately. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that, \"by all accounts, Khan Canada (through Khan Mongolia) acquired the Exploration License,\" though Khan Mongolia was not a party to the CAUC joint venture.600 It is also undisputed that the Exploration License was never formally merged with the Mining License, or transferred to the partners of the CAUC joint venture.601 There is no evidence that the Claimants made any formal proposals or took any active steps in this regard. Although, as the Claimants\u2019 assert, Khan may have intended to merge the two licenses and informal discussions regarding a potential merger may have taken place,602 the Tribunal must take the situation as it was at the time of the Respondents\u2019 allegedly wrongful acts, which is that the Mining and Exploration Licenses were not in fact merged. Accordingly, there is no legal basis upon which the Tribunal could treat the Exploration License as being part of the CAUC joint venture.\n\nAward on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 337.\n\n*See* Memorial, \u00b6 48; Statement of Defence, \u00b6 178; Respondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 15; Respondents\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 15.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Brief, p. 6.\n\n292.\n\nHaving found that there was no \"unity of investment,\" the Tribunal must consider separately whether the Respondents breached their obligations toward (i) Khan Canada and CAUC Holding in relation to the Mining License, and (ii) Khan Netherlands in relation to the Exploration License. In the event of a finding of liability, the Tribunal will also have to assess the value of the Claimants\u2019 investments in Mongolia as they stood as at the Valuation Date.\n\n**B. FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW BREACHES AND LIABILITY TOWARD ALL THREE CLAIMANTS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question of the Respondents\u2019 liability. In particular, in the sections below, the Tribunal considers whether the Respondents breached their obligations under Articles 8.2 and 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law.\n\n294.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that a finding that the Respondents breached Articles 8.2 or 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law in relation to each of the Mining License and the Exploration License, as well as in relation to any related contractual rights held under the Agreements, would suffice to establish the Respondents\u2019 liability toward all three Claimants.\n\n295.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that a breach by Mongolia of any provision of the Foreign Investment Law would constitute a breach of the ECT\u2019s so-called \"umbrella\" clause, Article 10(1):\n\nThe Claimants submit that the terms \"any obligations\" [in Article 10(1) of the ECT] encompass the statutory obligations of the host state and in this case, Mongolia\u2019s obligations under the Foreign Investment Law. Given the ordinary meaning of the term \"any\" and the fact that the Respondents have not submitted any arguments or authorities to the contrary, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of Article 10(1) of the ECT. It follows that a breach by Mongolia of any obligations it may have under the Foreign Investment Law would constitute a breach of the provisions of Part III of the Treaty.603\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 438.\n\n296.\n\nAccordingly, a finding that the Respondents breached Articles 8.2 or 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law in relation to the Mining and Exploration Licenses would establish that the Respondents breached their obligations toward CAUC Holding and Khan Canada under the Foreign Investment Law, and that Mongolia breached its obligations toward Khan Netherlands under the ECT through operation of the umbrella clause.\n\n**C. Did the Respondents Breach Articles 8.2 or 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Did the Claimants have an investment within the meaning of the Foreign Investment Law?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nArticles 8.2 and 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law provide:\n\n(2) Foreign investment within the territory of Mongolia shall not be unlawfully expropriated.\n\n(3) Investments of foreign investors may be expropriated only for public purposes or interests and only in accordance with due process of law on a non-discriminatory basis and on payment of full compensation.\n\n298.\n\nOn their face, these provisions protect \"foreign investment\" and the \"investment of foreign investors\" against certain types of expropriation.\n\n299.\n\nArticle 3.1 of the Foreign Investment Law defines \"foreign investment\" as \"every type of tangible and intangible property which is invested in Mongolia by a foreign investor for the purpose of establishing a business entity within the territory of Mongolia or cooperating with a Mongolian business entity.\"604 Article 6 of the Foreign Investment Law outlines the \"forms of foreign investment,\" which include \"acquiring rights under the laws, concession and product sharing contract to exploit and process natural resources\"605 and \"concluding a contract on marketing and management.\"606\n\nForeign Investment Law of Mongolia, art. 3.1, Exhibit CLA-8. *See also* First Tsogt Report, \u00b6 67.\n\nForeign Investment Law of Mongolia, art. 6.4, Exhibit CLA-8.\n\nForeign Investment Law of Mongolia, art. 6.5, Exhibit CLA-8.\n\n300.\n\nIt appears from these provisions that the Claimants\u2019 rights in the Mining and Exploration Licenses, as well as their contractual rights stemming from the Agreements, are protected as \"foreign investment\" under the Foreign Investment Law only if they constitute \"tangible and intangible property\" of the Claimants. This is a controversial question between the Parties, as the Respondents contend that rights held under mining exploration and exploitation licenses do not constitute a form of property under Mongolian law.607\n\n*See* paragraphs 123-124 above.\n\n301.\n\nThe *Commentaries* on the Constitution define \"property in its broad meaning\" as \"the relations between people for the purposes of acquiring individual material wealth, as well as producing and distributing it; and property rights arise from these relationships [...].\"608 The 2002 Civil Code, in turn, defines \"property\" as \"tangible assets, and intellectual values, which are intangible property, as well as rights earned by means not prohibited by law or not conflicting with commonly accepted behavioral moral norms [...].\"609 The Code goes on to define \"intangible property\" as \"[r]ights and claims that bring profit to their owner or that entitle to demand from others [...].\"610\n\nExhibit RL-59, as translated at Reply, \u00b6 138.\n\n2002 Civil Code, art. 83.1, Exhibit CLA-117.\n\n2002 Civil Code, art. 84.5, Exhibit CLA-117; Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 23.\n\n302.\n\nThe plain text of these provisions suggests that Mongolian law is consistent with the general notion that rights under licenses (as well as contractual rights) to exploit natural resources constitute intangible property.\n\n303.\n\nIn support of their argument that license rights are not property, the Respondents argue that\n\n(i) the 2002 Civil Code does not apply to relationships of administrative subordination, and that\n\n(ii) licenses such as the Mining and Exploration Licenses cannot be transferred or pledged freely. The Respondents\u2019 expert, Mr. Bayar, cites a decision of the Mongolian Supreme Court, *Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom,* for the proposition that \"[a] mining license [...] is possessed but not owned by any entity, and therefore there is no legal ground to consider such mining licence to be a property right which is transferable to the ownership of others.\"611\n\nSecond Bayar Report, \u00b6 44, *quoting* Mongolian Supreme Court, *Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom* (March 20, 2012), Exhibit RL-173.\n\n304.\n\nOn the first point, the Respondents\u2019 argument cannot be sustained. Article 1.2 of the 2002 Civil Code states that it \"shall not apply to the property relations [...] arising from the administrative subordination of one person to another.\"612 This provision necessitates a conclusion that property relations may arise from situations of administrative subordination, even though the Code itself may not apply. The Tribunal cannot extrapolate from this provision that licenses and the rights conferred thereunder are not the \"property\" of license holders in a general sense.\n\n2002 Civil Code, art. 1.2, Exhibit RL-172.\n\n305.\n\nOn the second point, the Tribunal finds that the Mining and Exploration Licenses can be pledged and transferred under Mongolian law.613 The Mining License was issued under the 1995 Minerals Law, Article 14.2 of which provides that mining licenses are fully transferable with the consent of the State:\n\nIf Parties wish to transfer or take over a licence or to amend the rights and obligations established under it (whether in whole or in part) they shall submit an application, and the transferee of the licence or rights shall confirm and notify in writing that he or she can observe the obligations. The body which previously granted the licence shall give its decision in respect of the transfer of the licence or right(s) within 60 days of the date of receipt of the application and notification.614\n\n2006 Minerals Law, arts. 49, 51-52, Exhibit CLA-118.\n\n1997 Minerals Law, art. 14.2, Exhibit RL-50. *See* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 22.\n\n306.\n\nThe Exploration License was issued under the 1997 Minerals Law, Article 12.3 of which similarly states that the holder of an exploration license holds \"the right to transfer or pledge all or part of an exploration license in accordance with the terms and conditions of this law.\"615 The Exploration License also confers \"the exclusive right to obtain a mining license for any part of an exploration area upon fulfilling the terms and conditions of this law.\"616\n\n1997 Minerals Law, art. 12.3, Exhibit CLA-140 (emphasis added). *See* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 33.\n\n1997 Minerals Law, art. 17.2, Exhibit CLA-17.2. *See* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 35.\n\n307.\n\nFurther, *Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom* does not provide a basis on which to depart from the understanding of license rights as intangible property. The Respondents cite this case to support their broader argument that, because Mongolian law places restrictions on the transfer and pledging of minerals licenses, licenses may not be transferred freely and, therefore, may not be considered \"property.\"617 However, the Tribunal does not agree with the Respondents\u2019 conclusion. Generally, states may place limitations and restrictions on property transactions. The presence of such limitations on the disposal of property does not mean that the rights in question are not \"property.\" In *Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom,* the Supreme Court held that Article 51.1 of the 1996 Minerals Law allows \"that a holder of a mining licence or an exploration licence may pledge its licence to a bank or a non-banking financial institution together with the related documents such as the exploration work results, geological information and feasibility study reports, and assets which are permitted to pledge by law.\"618 The Court summarized that the 1996 Minerals Law \"provide [s] that a licence alone shall not be a pledge item.\"619 The Court found that \"the only possibility to pledge a minerals license\" was a limited one, and there are circumstances in which a \"mining licence holder has grounds to deem the pledge agreement illegal and void when the licence is pledged along and to persons other than banks or a non-banking financial institu[tion] [,..].\"620 Nonetheless, the existence of this limitation on pledging does not lead the Tribunal to conclude that such licenses are not property, even though the Respondents take out of context a quotation from the decision and present it as a hard rule.621 Indeed, *Gobi Shoo* holds that a mining license may be pledged to a bank or other financial institution together with \"related documents.\"622 The Tribunal is not convinced that it should depart from the general notion of license rights being intangible property.\n\n*See* Second Bayar Report, \u00b6\u00b6 39-51; Respondents\u2019 Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 183-189.\n\nMongolian Supreme Court, *Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom* (20 March 2012), p. 1, Exhibit RL-173.\n\nMongolian Supreme Court, *Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom* (20 March 2012), p. 1, Exhibit RL-173.\n\nMongolian Supreme Court, *Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom* (20 March 2012), pp. 1-2, Exhibit RL-173.\n\nThe Respondents\u2019 legal expert quotes from the decision: \"A mining licence, however, is possessed but not owned by any entity, and therefore there is no legal ground to consider such mining licence to be a property right which is transferable to the ownership of others.\" Second Bayar Report, \u00b6 44, quoting Mongolian Supreme Court, *Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom* (20 March 2012), p. 1, Exhibit RL-173. However, upon considering the entire decision, it becomes clear that a minerals licence may be pledged to a bank or financial institution when it is pledged together with \"related documents.\" Mongolian Supreme Court, *Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom* (20 March 2012), p. 1, Exhibit RL-173.\n\nMongolian Supreme Court, *Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom* (20 March 2012), p. 1, Exhibit RL-173.\n\n308.\n\nThus, the Tribunal is satisfied that the rights under the Mining and Exploration Licenses and stemming from the Agreements constitute intangible property under Mongolian law. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that these rights are a protected investment under the Foreign Investment Law.\n\n**2. Were the Claimants deprived of their investment?**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nThe next question for the Tribunal is whether the Claimants were deprived of their investment by the Respondents\u2019 actions. The Claimants assert that the correct standard to be applied here is that of \"substantial deprivation.\"623 The Respondents do not dispute this.624\n\n*See* Memorial, \u00b6 188; Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, pp. 2-3.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 204, n. 244, quoting *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal SA. v. The Argentine Republic, and A WG Group v. The Argentine Republic, Decision on Liability,* 30 July 2010, \u00b6 145, Exhibit RL-104 (\"An indirect expropriation requires a substantial deprivation of an investment\").\n\n310.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimants were substantially deprived of their rights under both the Mining License and the Exploration License through the combined effect of the supposedly temporary suspension of the two licenses by Order No. 141 and the Temporary Invalidation Notices and the NEA\u2019s subsequent failure to re-register them. The fact that Mongolia did not intend to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses is supported by (i) the issuance of the Permanent Invalidation Notices on 9 April 2010; (ii) the NEA\u2019s 12 November 2010 declaration in the Mongolian press that \"the renewal of special permits by these companies is not a possibility\";625 and (iii) the issuance on 15 December 2010 of Notices Nos. 4/1401 and 4/102, stating that the Mining and Exploration Licenses had \"not been reinstated since your company has not satisfied the conditions and requirements of the law and has not pursued relevant laws and regulations in your operation.\"626\n\nDeclaration published in Mongolian National Post (12 November 2010), Exhibit C-7. *See* Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6 45.\n\nNotifications 4/1401 and 4/1402, 15 December 2010, Exhibits C-8, C-9.\n\n311.\n\nAdditionally, the loss of their rights under the Mining License deprived CAUC Holding and Khan Canada of their rights and benefits under the Agreements. The preamble of the Minerals Agreement makes clear that the Mining License was necessary for Khan to realize its benefits under the Agreements, since the CAUC joint venture was established \"to mine and process uranium ore as well as other minerals [...] in the area of the Dornod deposit in northeastern Mongolia for the benefit of the Parties.\"627 The Respondents had a number of obligations under the Agreements, and the invalidation and failure to re-register the Mining License made the execution of those contractual obligations impossible.628 Without the Mining License, CAUC Holding\u2019s (and through it, Khan Canada\u2019s) contractual rights under the Agreements were essentially worthless.\n\nJoint Venture Agreement, Preamble, Exhibit C-17A.\n\nAs Claimants noted in their Pre-Hearing Brief (\u00b6 39), the Agreements are clear about the obligations of Mongolia: to \"guarantee [...] issuance of a license permitting development of [Deposit No. 2] and [Deposit No. 7]\"; to guarantee that \"[n]o area subject to a license or mineral title issued pursuant to this Agreement may later be designated by the Mongolian Party as opened to competitive bidding as long as this Agreement is in effect, unless such area has been returned to the Government\"; and to \"contribute[] the right to utilize [Deposit No. 7] [to CAUC]\" when \"uranium may be mined and produced from [Deposit No. 7] economically [...].\" Minerals Agreement, arts. 1.1, 4.3, 5.4, respectively, Exhibit C-17A. *See also* Founding Agreement, art. 3.6, Exhibit C-16A (\"Property of the Company will not be subject to requisition or confiscation\").\n\n312.\n\nTherefore, it does not matter that the Agreements were not formally terminated. Without the Mining License, the Agreements could not proceed. Thus, not only were the three Claimants deprived of their rights under the Mining and Exploration Licenses, but CAUC Holding (and through it, Khan Canada) was deprived of the benefit of its contractual rights under the Agreements.\n\n**3. Was this deprivation of property a** ***khuraakh*** **or a** ***daichlakh?***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nWhile in their English translations Articles 8.2 and 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law both refer to property being \"expropriated,\" in the Mongolian original two different words are used in these provisions to refer to the notion of expropriation. Article 8.2 uses the word *\"khuraakh,\"* while Article 8.3 refers to *\"daichlakh\"629* According to the Claimants\u2019 legal expert, Mr. Tsogt, these two terms refer to two distinct situations in which a taking of property can be carried out under colour of authority under Mongolian law.630\n\n*See* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 65 and 71, n. 95.\n\n*See* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 65, 69, 71.\n\n314.\n\nMr. Tsogt explains that *khuraakh* \"refers to a situation in which the law authorizes the State to deprive an owner of its property due to the property owner\u2019s breaches of law, or its use of the property in a manner that endangers the interests of third parties.\"631 As put by the Respondents\u2019 legal expert, Mr. Bayar, *khuraakh* is \"a seizure of property by authority of law as a penalty for unlawful conduct by a person or entity.\"632 A *khuraakh* may be carried out without payment of compensation.633*Daichlakh,* by contrast, \"refers to a taking of property or other invalidation of property rights by the State under circumstances where that action is necessary in order to satisfy an important public need\"634 and must be accompanied by the payment of compensation.635 Both a *khuraakh* and a *daichlakh* can be legal or illegal.636\n\nThird Tsogt Report, \u00b6 38.\n\nFirst Bayar Report, \u00b6 33 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*See* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 68.\n\nSecond Tsogt Report, \u00b6 71.\n\nFIL, art. 8.3, Authority CLA-8; Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 71.\n\nSecond Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 67, 71.\n\n315.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Mongolian authorities explicitly justified their refusal to reregister the Mining and Exploration Licenses by invoking alleged breaches of Mongolian law by the Claimants. The Permanent Invalidation Notices informed Khan Mongolia and CAUC that the \"license [s] that used to be owned by [them] [were] made invalid on groundings that [they] ha[d] not undertaken any measures to remove violations of the laws and regulations up until now.\"637 The NEA\u2019s Notices 4/1401 and 4/1402 of 15 December 2010 informed Khan Mongolia and CAUC that their \"license[s] ha[d] not been reinstated since [they] ha[d] not satisfied the conditions and requirements of the law and ha[d] not pursued relevant laws and regulations in [their] operation.638 In a public declaration, the Mongolian Government stated that it had not renewed the Mining and Exploration Licenses \"due to the fact that [the license holders] ha[d] repeatedly broken the laws on Mongolian Mineral Resources, the Underground Land usage, the Land of Especially Protected Areas, the Special Permit on Company Operations, and ha[d] not corrected these infractions within the time frame allotted by the law.\"639 The NEA argued before the Administrative Court that it could not re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses because Khan had failed to correct its breaches of Mongolian law.640 In these proceedings, the Respondents also argued that the Mining and Exploration Licenses could not be re-registered because the Claimants did not remedy their breaches of Mongolian law.641\n\nNEA Statement No. 8/361 (9 April 2010), Exhibit C-5; NEA Statement No. 8/360 (9 April 2010), Exhibit C-6.\n\nNotifications 4/1401 and 4/1402, 15 December 2010, Exhibits C-8, C-9.\n\n\"Declaration,\" National Post, 12 November 2010, Exhibit C-7.\n\n\"Taking into consideration the fact that until the present date Khan Resources LLC failed to correct breaches in above, re-registration and re-issuing of exploration license 9282X shall be considered as having no legal grounds.\" Resolution No. 340, Administrative Court of the Capital City, *Khan Resources LLC v. Nuclear Energy Agency* (2 August 2010), Exhibit C-13 (p. 5).\n\n*See* paragraphs 154-63, 205 above.\n\n316.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondents did not pay (nor appeared to intend to pay) compensation to the Claimants.\n\n317.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the invalidation and failure to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses must be analysed as a *khuraakh* under Mongolian law.\n\n**4. Was the** ***khuraakh*** **lawful?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nHaving established that the invalidation of the licenses was a *khuraakh,* the Tribunal must consider whether this *khuraakh* was lawful or unlawful. Article 8.2 of the Foreign Investment Law only prohibits unlawful *khuraakh,* that is, according to Mr. Tsogt, a \"situation where property rights are invalidated under color of authority but not in accordance with due authorization or process of law.\"642 In order for a *khuraakh* to be lawful, \"the law must provide a basis to consider that the owner has forfeited its rights and, furthermore, the correct legal process must be followed in the execution of this law. If either of these requirements is not complied with, the confiscation will be considered illegal.\"643 It thus appears that the requirement of lawfulness has a substantive component (the penalty must be imposed on a valid legal basis) as well as a procedural component (the penalty must be imposed in accordance with due process of law).\n\nSecond Tsogt Report, \u00b6 69.\n\nSecond Tsogt Report, \u00b6 69.\n\n*(i) Was there a valid legal basis for the invalidation and failure to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nAs described above, the Respondents invalidated and then refused to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses on the ground of the Claimants\u2019 alleged breaches of Mongolian law. However, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Respondents were not able to point to any breaches of Mongolian law that would justify the decisions to invalidate and not re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses.\n\n320.\n\nThe April 2009, July 2009, and March 2010 SSIA Reports are the only documents in which the alleged breaches of Mongolian law are detailed. As seen from the citations set out in paragraph 315 above, later documents related to the invalidation and failure to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses only referred to the Claimants\u2019 general failure to remedy violations of Mongolian law of which they had previously been notified.\n\n321.\n\nWith regard to the April 2009 Report, it is worth noting at the outset that the Claimants assert that they saw it for the first time in this arbitration.644 As the Respondents have not been able to show otherwise, this Report must be approached with caution. This Report lists five violations of Mongolian law.645 Two out of the five violations are mentioned again in the July 2009 SSIA Report,646 which the Claimants acknowledge receiving at the time. For this reason, the Tribunal considers the three unique violations identified in the April 2009 SSIA Report here, while the other two violations are discussed in the context of the July 2009 SSIA Report below.\n\nThird Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 202-3.\n\n*See* paragraph 77 above, n. 72, referring to April 2009 SSIA Report, Exhibit R-62.\n\nThese two violations regarded (1) Article 45.1 of the Subsoil Law and Article 5.6 of the 2006 Minerals Law, relating to the trading of shares and the publication of information regarding Mongolian mineral reserves on the Toronto Stock Exchange; and (2) Article 5.4 of the 2006 Minerals Law, due to a failure to \"enter into a mining agreement with the MRAM.\" Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 88-93, referring to Exhibit R-62.\n\n322.\n\nFirst, in the April 2009 Report, the SSIA alleged that Khan was in violation of Article 19.2.3 of the 2006 Minerals Law, due to an overlap between the Additional Property (covered by the Exploration License) and the Yakhi Lake Special Protected Area, a reserve set aside for grazing animals.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that this is a \"hypothetical \u2018violation\u2019 lacking all credibility.\"647 Early maps of the Additional Property show it abutting, but not touching the nearby Yakhi Lake Special Protected Area.648 The boundaries of the reserve area were imprecise from the beginning.649 Further, Khan worked with Government officials to remedy the potential overlap, removing the area from its license conversion application after consultation with the Office of Geology, Mining and Cadastre.650 Given the fact that the boundary coordinates of the protected area were unclear, and that Khan made a good faith attempt to remedy the potential violation, the Tribunal does not see how this alleged violation could have justified the invalidation and failure to re-register the Exploration License.\n\nReply, \u00b6 291.\n\nHrayr Agnerian, Technical Report on the Dornod Uranium Project, 27 September 2007, p. 48, Exhibit C-151; Dornod Uranium Project Pre-feasibility Study Report, 7 August 2007, Exhibit C-60.\n\n*See* Boundaries of Toson Khulstai, Khar Yamaat, Yakh Lake Natural Reserve Areas, Attachment of the Resolution No. 28, 9 April 1998, Exhibit C-412.\n\nSecond Arsenault Witness Statement, \u00b6 126; Letter No. 07/07/09 from Khan Resources to the MRAM, 17 July 2009, Exhibit C-84.\n\n324.\n\nSecond, the SSIA alleged that CAUC had violated the Radiation Protection and Safety Law, as had previously been noted during the 2005 and 2006 SSIA inspections. The Tribunal notes that Khan took steps to remedy this alleged violation, including by purchasing a monitoring tool and protective clothing for employees, and creating a waste management plan.651\n\n*See* Second Arsenault Witness Statement, \u00b6 143-5.\n\n325.\n\nThird, the April 2009 SSIA Report mentioned a violation of Article 33.1 of the Law on Special Protected Areas, due to the storage of radioactive materials in a protected area. The alleged violation concerned the manner in which Khan was storing radioactive drill cores. However, during a site visit in December 2008 by inspectors from the SSIA and the Nuclear Energy Commission, no violations were noted. An inspector from the SSIA even praised Khan for being \"a good example for other companies undertaking radioactive mineral exploration and development activity,\" and an inspector with the Nuclear Energy Commission noted that \"[t]he storage building complies fully with the regulations of Mongolia on radiation protection and safety requirements [...] \"652 The Chairman of the NEA followed up by writing to Khan that \"the storage of cores containing uranium complies with the radiation protection and safety standards.\"653 Given this strong praise only months before the April 2009 inspection, the Tribunal finds that Khan did not violate the law in its storage of the drill core.\n\nMeeting Minutes, 12 December 2008, Exhibit C-414.\n\nLetter No. 197 from NEC to Khan Resources, 29 December 2008, Exhibit C-422.\n\n326.\n\nIn the July 2009 Report, the SSIA first alleged that CAUC had \"failed to submit the exploration results and work reports to the Mineral Council for its consideration\" and had not \"register[ed] the reserves of the deposit with the State Registry of Mineral Resources.\"654 The 1995 and 2006 Minerals Laws require license holders to submit a reserve report and a report on the results of exploration efforts.655\n\nSSIA Report No. 08/01/1699, 10 July 2009, Exhibit R-9.\n\n1995 Minerals Law, art. 27, Authority RL-50; 2006 Minerals Law, arts. 48.3, 48.7.2, Authority CLA-118. *See* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 149.\n\n327.\n\nThe Law on Subsoil also requires that \"[r]eserves of mineral resources, deposits and occurrences shall be registered with the central national registry.\"656 However, the Law on Subsoil puts the ultimate burden of reserve registration on the State, as it requires that \"[t]he state central administrative authority in charge of geology and mining [the MRAM] shall monitor compliance with the following regulations and requirements, and shall take actions to eliminate and prevent violations.\"657\n\n1989 Law on Subsoil, art. 45.1, Authority CLA-I26a. *See* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 152.\n\n1989 Law on Subsoil, art. 53.1, Authority CLA-I26a.\n\n328.\n\nAs at October 2007, the Claimants\u2019 reserves were validly registered, as demonstrated by the MRAM\u2019s 18 October 2007 letter indicating that \"[t]he reserves of Dornod uranium deposit are registered under No. 0881 in the State Integrated Database.\"658\n\nLetter No. 141, the MRAM to Khan Resources, 18 October 2007, Exhibit C-123.\n\n329.\n\nIn 2008, Khan submitted to the MRAM an updated reserve re-registration submission that reflected a \"new estimate of mineral resources and mineral reserves.\"659 The fact that this new estimate was not ultimately registered appears to have been due primarily to the inaction of the Mongolian authorities.\n\nLetter No. 59/08 from Khan Resources to MRPA, 29 August 2008, Exhibit C-64.\n\n330.\n\nThe Parties agree that, before the licensing agency may register a reserve, a Team of Experts must be appointed to accept and review the reserves report submitted by the applicant. Next, the Minerals Council must be convened and must review and issue a decision on the conclusion put forth by the Team of Experts. Based on the decision of the Minerals Council, the MRAM must then register the reserves in the State Integrated Registry, or else will deny such registration.660 In this case, although Khan submitted its updated reserve re-registration submission in August 2008, a Team of Experts was not appointed to review the submission until October 2009,661 after the Mining License had been temporarily suspended,662 the NEL and LPCNEL had been passed,663 and Mongolia and Russia had agreed on a separate joint venture that would exploit the Dornod deposit.664 After the Team of Experts\u2019 recommendation was finally issued, the Claimants made a diligent effort have the Minerals Council consider the re-registration of reserves, but in spite of such effort they were unsuccessful.665 When the Minerals Council finally scheduled a meeting for January 2010, the meeting was cancelled one hour before it was set to begin,666 and no further meeting was ever scheduled, in spite of multiple requests.667\n\nThird Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 165-6; Second Bayar Report, \u00b6\u00b6 78-83.\n\nLetter No. 1/2790 from the MRAM to Khan Resources, 9 October 2009, Exhibit C-134.\n\n*See* SSIA Report No. 08/01/1699, 10 July 2009, Exhibit R-9.\n\nLaw of Mongolia on Nuclear Energy, 16 July 2009, Exhibit R-ll; Law of Mongolia on Procedures on Compliance of the Nuclear Energy Law, 16 July 2009, Authority CLA-142.\n\n*See e.g.* Russia, Mongolia form Dornod Uranium Joint Venture, Reuters, 25 August 2009, Exhibit C-81.\n\n*See* Arsenault Witness Statement, \u00b6 85, citing Letter No. 59/08 from Khan Resources to the MRAM, 29 August 2008, Exhibit C-64; Letter No. 12/07/09 from Khan Resources to Ministry for Mineral Resources and Energy, 29 July 2009, Exhibit C-132; Letter No. 14/09 from CAUC to the Ministry for Mineral Resources and Energy, 29 July 2009, Exhibit C-133. *See also* CAUC Meeting Minutes, 16-17 April 2009, pp. 3-4, Exhibit C-409; Letter No. 33/09 from CAUC to SSIA, 24 December 2009, Exhibit C-395; Letter No. 08/01/09 from Khan Resources to the MRAM, 28 January 2009, Exhibit C-394; Letter No. 06/01/09 from Khan Resources to the MRAM, 22 January 2009, Exhibit C-3 93; Meeting Minutes, Khan Resources, 17 September 2007, Exhibit C-380.\n\nLetter No. 25/10 from CAUC to the MRAM, 22 July 2010, Exhibit C-140; Second Arsenault Witness Statement, \u00b6 112; Second Jamsrandorj Witness Statement, \u00b6 32.\n\n*See e.g.* Letter No. 21/10 from CAUC to the MRAM, 14 April 2010, Exhibit C-138; Letter No. 14/04/10 from Khan Resources to the MRAM, 14 April 2010, Exhibit C-139; Letter No. 25/10 from CAUC to the MRAM, 22 July 2010, Exhibit C-140.\n\n331.\n\nFurther, though the Respondents argue that Khan Mongolia\u2019s report was not re-registered because it contained \"deficiencies\" and it had undertaken \"insufficient\" work on exploration,668 the Claimants have shown that Khan made an updated reserves submission to remedy those alleged deficiencies \"in accordance with the experts\u2019 conclusions, and, in order to have it discussed at the Mineral Resources Professional Council (MRPC) and to have it in the state register [,..].\"669 The Minerals Council and Team of Experts never requested that Khan revise that submission.\n\n*See* Respondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 29, referring to Letter No. 1/3882 from the MRAM to the Chairman of the NEA, p. 9, Exhibit C-137.\n\nLetter No. 04/01/10 from Khan Resources to MRPC, 19 January 2010, Exhibit C-25OA.\n\n332.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal notes that what were characterized as \"deficiencies\" by the Respondents were called \"recommendations\" in the conclusion of the Team of Experts.670 The Claimants argue that these deficiencies were more akin to requests for technical clarification that are ordinarily requested by the Team of Experts.671 The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants on this point.\n\n*See* Integrated Conclusion of the Experts on the Reserve, p. 10, Exhibit C-137.\n\nSecond Arsenault Witness Statement, \u00b6 109.\n\n333.\n\nBoth Parties\u2019 experts agree that \"if the Minerals Council makes a determination that an applicant or a private company has submitted correct information about the reserves,\" then the reserves \"will be registered.\"672 The Tribunal observes that, even if there originally had been deficiencies, the MRAM should have registered the reserves once those deficiencies had been corrected.\n\nBayar, Transcript 699:25 to 700:6, 13-18. See also Tsogt, Transcript 607:14-25.\n\n334.\n\nFurther, even if the Claimants had failed to register reserves, the Mining and Exploration Licenses should not have been revoked on that basis. The 1995 and 2006 Minerals Laws carry the penalty of a fine for failing to submit work reports and reserve estimates.673 The Law on Subsoil provides no particular penalty for a failure to register.674 Accordingly, the Tribunal sees no basis in law for the Government to depart from the normal sanction of a fine for failure to register reserves.\n\n1995 Minerals Law, art. 56.1.2, Authority RL-50; 2006 Minerals Law, art. 66.1.2, Authority CLA-118. *See also* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 151.\n\n*See* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 152.\n\n335.\n\nSecond, the SSIA contended that CAUC did not \"enter into a mining agreement with MRAM.\"675 However, Article 5.4 of the 2006 Minerals Law, which the SSIA cited in its report, concerns state participation in a mining joint venture,676 and the Tribunal notes that, at the time of the report, the Claimants had already entered into a mining agreement with Mongolia through the Minerals Agreement and the Founding Agreement.677 The Tribunal finds that the Claimants were not in breach of Article 5.4 at the time of the July 2009 SSIA report or thereafter. Moreover, the 2006 Minerals Law does not give the SSIA the authority to monitor mining agreements, and does not prescribe any particular sanction for failure to \"enter into a mining agreement with MRAM,\" much less a harsh penalty such as revocation of a license.678\n\nSSIA Report No. 08/01/1699, 10 July 2009, Exhibit R-9.\n\n2006 Minerals Law, art. 5.4, Authority CLA-118.\n\n*See* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 157.\n\n*See* Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 158.\n\n336.\n\nThird, the SSIA cited as a breach the fact that Khan Canada \"offered [its] shares for the public at the [Toronto] stock exchange.\"679 However, the provision of law cited by the SSIA does not prohibit such activity. Article 5.6 of the 2006 Minerals Law states that \"[a] legal person holding a mining license for a mineral deposit of strategic importance shall trade no less than 10 percent of its shares on the Mongolian Stock Exchange.\"680 The Tribunal finds that this provision would not have prohibited Khan Canada from offering shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In fact, as observed by the Claimants\u2019 witness Mr. Arsenault, if the Respondents were correct, other major mining companies in Mongolia also would have their licenses suspended, as many of them have parent companies that trade shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.681 The Respondents are incorrect on this point.\n\nSSIA Report No. 08/01/1699, 10 July 2009, Exhibit R-9.\n\n2006 Minerals Law, art. 5.6, Authority CLA-118a.\n\nSecond Arsenault Witness Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 138-40.\n\n337.\n\nEven Mongolia, it seems, recognized that the alleged breaches had been remedied. On 11 January 2010, CAUC reached an administrative settlement with the MRAM, and on 12 January 2010, the MRAM noted in a letter to the Administrative Court that \"according to the conclusion of the experts appointed by the order of the Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy, the condition to eliminate the violations stated on the conclusion No. 08/01/1699 of 10 July 2009 of the inspector of the State Specialized Inspection Authority has been created.\"682\n\nLetter, the MRAM to Capital City Administrative Court (12 January 2010), Exhibit C-233.\n\n338.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the Administrative Court held that the violations listed in the July 2009 SSIA Report were not legitimate grounds on which to deny re-registration.683\n\nSecond Tsogt Report, \u00b6 178. The Administrative Court held, regarding CAUC\u2019s claim: \"The argument regarding the suspension of CAUC\u2019s license, which is based on the SSIA conclusions, is not legitimate grounds to not re-register Mining License 237A.\" Decision No. 325 of the Administrative Court of the First Instance (19 July 2010), Exhibit R-25 (p. 13). For related resolutions of the Mongolian courts, *see* Resolution No. 340 (2 August 2010), issued by the Administrative Court of the Capital City in the matter of *Khan Resources LL v. Nuclear Energy Agency,* Exhibit C-13; Resolution No. 374 (13 October 2010), issued by the Administrative Appellate Court of Mongolia in the matter of *Central Asian Uranium Company LLC v. Nuclear Energy Agency,* Exhibit C-14.\n\n339.\n\nThe SSIA carried out another inspection in 2010, resulting in the March 2010 SSIA Report.684 Some of the violations in the March 2010 Report mirrored those of the July 2009 Report, including an allegation that CAUC had failed to register reserves.685 The March 2010 SSIA Report also included allegations that CAUC violated terms of the Agreements.686 However, the Claimants\u2019 legal expert notes that the 2006 Minerals Law does not grant the SSIA authority to control or monitor mining agreements.687 The Respondents\u2019 expert cites Articles 11 and 66.1 of the Law of Mongolia on State and Local Property for the proposition that a member of the SPC has \"a clear basis [...] to monitor questions such as changes in shareholding structure and compliance with contractual obligations in the case of an enterprise involving Mongolian State ownership.\"688 Yet, even if this is so under Mongolian law, it has not been demonstrated that the penalty for a violation related to contractual compliance would be the invalidation of a license.\n\nMarch 2010 Report, SSIA, 15 March 2010, Exhibit C-94.\n\nMarch 2010 Report, SSIA, 15 March 2010, \u00b6 5.3, Exhibit C-94.\n\nMarch 2010 Report, SSIA, 15 March 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 5.1-5.2, Exhibit C-94.\n\nSecond Tsogt Report, \u00b6 158.\n\nSecond Bayar Report, \u00b6 126, referring to Law on State and Local Government Property, Articles 11 and 66.1, Exhibit CLA-44.\n\n340.\n\nIn addition, the weakness of the Respondents\u2019 argument regarding the alleged breaches of Mongolian law strongly suggests that imposing a penalty on the Claimants for such breaches was not the Respondents\u2019 real motivation in invalidating and refusing to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses. Other evidence presented by the Claimants, and in particular the timing of the SSIA inspections, reports and the various invalidation notices, indicates that the Government was in fact motivated by the prospect of developing the Dornod deposits at greater profit with a Russian partner.\n\n341.\n\nIn January 2009, before the 2009 SSIA inspection, the Mongolian Prime Minister and the General Director of RosAtom met and planned a joint venture for the exploitation of uranium between Russia and Mongolia.689 In March 2009, just one week after Khan announced that the Dornod Project was economically feasible, the Prime Ministers of Mongolia and Russia met and \"established a cooperation agreement\" between the NEA and RosAtom.690 Soon after, in April 2009, the SSIA conducted its inspection of Khan. In August 2009, then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev visited Mongolia and, as reported in the media, formed a joint venture between Russia and Mongolia that would \"exploit the Dornod uranium deposit.\"691 In March 2010, the RosAtom General Director sent a letter to the NEA Chairman, thanking the NEA for rejecting the 2010 MOU and asking how it intended to establish the \"Dornod Uranum joint venture\" given that ARMZ had failed in its hostile takeover of Khan Canada. One week later, the SSIA found additional alleged violations after another inspection of Khan. By January 2011. in the context of burgeoning agreements with Russia, Mongolian officials were making statements in the press regarding the untrustworthiness of Khan, as well as alleging that Khan did not hold any licenses.692 Finally, there were press releases that indicated closer cooperation with Russia on the Dornod Project, including commentary from the mining industry that supported this conclusion.693\n\n\"BBC hosted delegations of Russian and Mongolian governments\" (28 January 2009), Exhibit C-79; Reply, \u00b6I7O.\n\nInterview by Prime Minister Bayar, *Century News* (19 March 2009), Exhibit C-181.\n\n\"Russia, Mongolia Form Dornod Uranium Joint Venture,\" Reuters, 25 August 2009, Exhibit C-81. See also \"Russian President Signs China-Style Energy Deals with Mongolia, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 25 August 2009, Exhibit C-80.\n\n*See e.g.* \"S. Enkhbat: Russian Accepted the Proposal of Mongolia Due to the Firm Position of the Prime Minister,\" Political Survey (4 January 2011), Exhibit C-101 (\"They [Khan] viewed Mongolia as a worst country that is weaker than the African countries. It could be inappropriate to say a bad word such as a swindler. Generally, they are very much cheaters\").\n\n*See e.g.* Exhibits C-198, C-245, C-483, C-496.\n\n342.\n\nIt is worth noting that the appointment of the Team of Experts, an essential step in the process for the re-registration of minerals reserves, was not appointed to review Khan\u2019s reserves reestimation submission until October 2009. By this point, as explained above, Mongolia had already made an agreement with Russia on a joint venture that would exploit the Dornod reserves. The Team of Experts\u2019 appointment also came after the SSIA purported to temporarily suspend the Mining License on 10 July 2OO9.694 The Tribunal observes that this confluence of dates is not merely coincidental, as it reflects the fact that Mongolia had decided to cooperate with the Russians on the Dornod deposit rather than to re-register the Claimants\u2019 reserves.\n\nSSIA Report No. 08/01/1699, 10 July 2009, Exhibit R-9.\n\n*(ii) Does alleged bad faith on the part of the Claimants justify the actions of the* *Respondents?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nThe Respondents have invoked the Claimants\u2019 alleged bad faith as an affirmative defence. Specifically, the Respondents assert that the Claimants made little to no tangible progress on the Dornod Project over a number of years, simply relying on data provided by Priargunsky to inform its technical filings and reserves estimates.695\n\n*See* paragraph 62 above.\n\n344.\n\nThe facts do not support the Respondents\u2019 argument and it therefore cannot succeed as an affirmative defence.\n\n345.\n\nThe factual record shows that progress was being made and that, until Mongolia\u2019s apparent decision to replace Khan by a Russian partner, there did not appear to be any concern regarding the rate of progress. As noted by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction, \"the studies and reports produced by the Claimants are tangible proof that progress was being made on the project.\"696 Most notably, the Claimants produced a DFS, which indicated that the Dornod Project was viable and could yield significant profits.697\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 337.\n\n*See* paragraph 60 above.\n\n346.\n\nMonAtom itself was aware of this progress. According to the minutes of a CAUC meeting in 2009, \"Khan Resources stated it had completed its commitments as per the original Founding Agreement,\" and \"Monatom acknowledged that, with the completion of these activities, and the recent changes brought forward by the GOM, it was timely to review the operational requirements of CAUC to move forward into production with a proper sharing of responsibilities.\"698\n\n*See* Minutes of the 13th Meeting of the Management Committee of CAUC (26 August 2009), Exhibit C-38 (p. 4).\n\n347.\n\nFurther, it is clear that the Claimants kept the Government informed of their activities. In addition to communication by people \"on the ground,\"699 the Claimants submitted annual reports to the Government describing the operations of the past year.700 As such, the Respondents cannot credibly claim that the Claimants failed to keep them informed.\n\n*See* testimony of Mr. Edey, Transcript (12 November 2013), 346:25 to 347:2.\n\n*See* testimony of Mr. Arsenault, Transcript (13 November 2013), 497:12-18.\n\n348.\n\nAs for the Respondents\u2019 claim that the Claimants attempted to surreptitiously deprive the other members of the CAUC joint venture of the benefits of the Exploration License, the Respondents have provided no evidence to support this assertion.\n\n*(iii) Was the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses carried out in accordance with due process of law?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Parties disagree on (1) whether the MRAM or the NEA was the proper licensing agency to make the final decision on re-registration of the Mining and Exploration Licenses under the NEL, and (2) whether certain NEL provisions apply to the decision-making procedure on reregistration. As will be seen below, the Tribunal need not resolve these disagreements here.\n\n350.\n\nIn short, the Tribunal finds that, after the temporary suspension of all minerals licenses in Mongolia through operation of Order No. 141, the relevant Mongolian licensing agency, whether the MRAM or the NEA, was obliged to re-register the licenses of all license holders who complied with the re-registration requirements set out in Attachment No. 1 to Order No. 120. A failure to re-register the license of a license holder whose application was compliant with Order No. 120, such as occurred in respect of the Mining and Exploration Licenses, thus constituted a breach of due process. Additionally, the relevant Mongolian licensing agency was under an obligation, at the very least, to issue a decision regarding re-registration. No such decision was issued in this case.\n\n351.\n\nThe Parties agree that Order No. 141 was issued to implement the LPCNEL.701 Article 1 of the LPCNEL required that \"[t]he exploration and mining licenses of Radioactive Minerals issued before the date the Nuclear Energy Law comes into force shall be newly registered according to the conditions and procedures specified in this Law on or before November 15, 2009.\"702 Article 2 required a license holder to \"submit an application to renew the registration of its license to the State Administrative body in charge of the nuclear energy issues and the licenses shall be registered and newly issued according to the Article 1 of this Law if it meets the conditions and requirements specified in the Nuclear Energy Law.\"703\n\nThird Tsogt Report, \u00b6 183; First Bayar Report, \u00b6 77.\n\nLPCNEL, art. 1, 16 July 2009, CLA-142.\n\nLPCNEL, art. 2, 16 July 2009, CLA-142.\n\n352.\n\nThe Parties disagree, however, about whether the NEL applied retroactively to licenses registered under prior minerals laws. The Respondents argue that the NEL governed the procedure for the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses.704 However, the licenses were not originally registered under the NEL, and, as the Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Tsogt, notes, it is not clear that the NEL was intended \"to regulate legal situations that came into existence prior to its entry into force [15 August 2009], or that make reference to the rights of minerals license holders acquired or maintained under other Mongolian laws.\"705 For this reason, Mr. Tsogt, suggests that the NEL \"did not purport to apply retroactively.\"706 The Respondents\u2019 expert, Mr. Bayar, disagrees, arguing that there is no temporal limitation in the NEL and pointing out that other changes to mineral legislation had been applied to the Mining and Exploration Licenses in the past.707\n\n*See* paragraphs 202-205 above.\n\nSecond Tsogt Report, \u00b6 100.\n\nThird Tsogt Report, \u00b6 174; Second Tsogt Report, \u00b6 122-29.\n\nSecond Bayar Report, \u00b6 90-1.\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Mr. Tsogt that the NEL does not apply retroactively to licenses registered under other minerals laws. The NEL regime applies to licenses registered under that law, and a license would need to be newly registered under the NEL for that regime to apply. In other words, the relevant Mongolian authority would have been in a position to invalidate the Mining and Exploration Licenses on the basis of a breach of the NEL only once the licenses had been initially registered under that law.\n\n354.\n\nUltimately, it is Order No. 120 that specifies the requirements for re-registration. Order No. 120 assumes this procedural authority because Order No. 141, which purported to invalidate the Mining and Exploration Licenses, required the NEA to follow Order No. 120.\n\n355.\n\nMr. Bayar states that the Mining and Exploration Licenses were invalidated according to Order No. 141, noting also that the Administrative Appellate Court found the Order to be valid.708 Thus, the Tribunal notes that the Respondents accept the authority of Order No. 141. Mr. Tsogt also appears to believe that Order No. 141 is the proper decree to look toward in determining whether due process was followed. Mr. Tsogt adds that, if Mr. Bayar \"accepts that Order No. 141 was the basis for the NEA to temporarily revoke the Licenses, he must also accept that the NEA should have followed the procedure for re-registration established in Order No. 141.\"709\n\nFirst Bayar Report, \u00b6 114, referring to Notifications 4/1401 and 4/1402, Exhibits C-8 and C-9.\n\nThird Tsogt Report, \u00b6 197.\n\n356.\n\nWith the Parties in agreement on the significance of Order No. 141, the Tribunal has examined the requirements of this Order, and it agrees with Mr. Tsogt that it required the NEA to follow the re-registration process set forth in Order No. 120.710 The Tribunal also agrees with Mr. Tsogt that, with regard to the revocation of the licenses, Order No. 141 was intended as a temporary measure, since Article 2 of the LPCNEL required that \"the licenses shall be registered and newly issued according to the Article 1 of this Law if it meets the conditions and requirements specified in the Nuclear Energy Law.\"711 No license was to be permanently invalidated until the re-registration application had been reviewed by the relevant licensing agency\u2014whether the MRAM or the NEA\u2014and the NEA had issued an official decision.\n\n*See* Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6 194. \"[B]efore the Nuclear Energy Law takes effect, Bayarbaysgalan T., head of the Licensing Department, is instructed to re-register exploration and exploitation licences of radioactive minerals in accordance with the conditions and procedures set forth in the Nuclear Energy Law and Temporary Procedures on Re-registering and Issuing Radioactive Minerals Licences as adopted by the Chairman\u2019s Decree no. 120 of Nuclear Energy Agency, dated 20 August 2009, on or before 15 November 2009.\" Order No. 141, art. 2, Exhibit R-12.\n\nLPCNEL, art. 2, 16 July 2009, CLA-142. Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 187, 193.\n\n357.\n\nThe process for re-registration is described in Articles 3.1 through 4.1 of Attachment No. 1 to Order No. 120.712 Article 4.1 of Attachment No. 1 specifies that \"[t]he Licensing Department shall examine the application requesting to renew the registration of exploration and mining license in conformity with the clause 3.1 of this instruction and shall re-issue the license if the application has met the conditions specified in the clauses 18.2, 18.3, 18.5 and 18.6 of the Nuclear Energy Law.\"713 Article 3.1 specifies two \"activities\" that the NEA must undertake in the review of applications: \"[e]xamin[ing] whether the applicant [...] has completed documents\" that meet certain conditions and \"[e]xamining whether the applicant [...] has paid exploration and mining license fees and royalty [,..].\"714 The NEL Articles 18.2, 18.3, 18.5 and 18.6 reference Articles 17.2 and 17.3, and, read together, the NEL articles referred to in Article 4.1 of Attachment No. 1 require that an applicant possess, *inter alia,* financial and operational ability, technological capability, and industry experience.715 Together, these provisions in Attachment No. 1 constitute the applicable criteria for re-registration of the Mining and Exploration Licenses.\n\nAttachment No. 1 to Order No. 120, Exhibit C-95. *See also* Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 195-6.\n\nAttachment No. 1 to Order No. 120, art. 4.1, Exhibit C-95.\n\nAttachment No. 1 to Order No. 120, art. 3.1, clauses 3.1.1-3.1.2, Exhibit C-95.\n\nNuclear Energy Law, arts. 17-18, Exhibit R-ll.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no legally significant reason why the Claimants would not have fulfilled the above application requirements. As argued at length by the Claimants, Khan Mongolia and CAUC possessed significant resources, capabilities, and expertise.716 A company of this level of capability should have no difficulty complying with the relevant NEL requirements. Nor did any of the Mongolian authorities rely on any purported failure by the Claimants to comply with the relevant NEL requirements.\n\n*See* paragraphs 57-61 above.\n\n359.\n\nMr. Bayar admitted at the hearing that \"[i]t is written in [...] Order No. 141, the Chairman of the NEA says to re-register,\" such that \"Order No. 141 required all the licenses covered by that order to be re-registered.\"717 The Tribunal therefore finds that the licensing agency\u2014whether properly the MRAM or the NEA\u2014should have re-registered the Mining and Exploration Licenses pursuant to the process set forth in Attachment No. 1 of Order No. 120 and its failure to do so constituted a breach of due process.\n\nBayar, Transcript 691:6-21.\n\n360.\n\nThe Respondents contend, however, that re-registration could be refused on the basis of Article 26.1 of the NEL. Their legal expert, Mr. Bayar, connects Attachment No. 1 to Article 26.1 of the NEL.718 First, Mr. Bayar points out that Article 7.2 of Attachment No. 1, which states that \"[t]he Licensing Department shall invalidate the license on the grounding of the clause 26.2 of the Article 26 of the Nuclear Energy Law,\" refers to Article 26.2 of the NEL. Next, Mr. Bayar connects Article 26.2 of the NEL to Article 26.1 of the NEL by noting that Article 26.2.1 cross-refers to Article 26.1.719 By so doing, Mr. Bayar suggests that the procedure set out in Attachment No. 1 incorporates by reference the four grounds of invalidation prescribed in Article 26.1, and, notably, the following ground: \"[f]ailure to comply with the requirement to eliminate violations during the period of suspension of a license.\" For Mr. Bayar, this connection between Article 26.1 of the NEL and Attachment No. 1 would justify the NEA\u2019s failure to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses: \"As the existence of these grounds would justify the revocation of a license, they must justify a decision not to re-register a license. Otherwise, the NEA would be in a position where it would re-register a license and then be required to de-register it straight away.\"720\n\nThird Bayar Report, \u00b6 198.\n\nSecond Bayar Report, \u00b6 104-5, referring to Attachment No. 1 to Order No. 120, art. 7.2, Exhibit C-95; Nuclear Energy Law, arts. 26.1-26.2, ExhibitR-11.\n\nSecond Bayar Report, \u00b6 102.\n\n361.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees. Article 26.1 concerns the invalidation of licenses under the NEL. It is not a part of the re-registration procedure. As discussed above, the Mining and Exploration Licenses were registered under the prior minerals laws. To be invalidated based on the conditions described in Article 26.1 of the NEL, they would have needed to first be registered under that new law. This re-registration never occurred.\n\n362.\n\nThe Tribunal notes here that, even if Article 26.1 of the NEL were a valid part of the reregistration procedure, the NEA would not have been justified in failing to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses on the grounds of non-compliance with this provision. As stated at paragraphs 319-342 above, the violations relied on by the Respondents did not justify the invalidation and failure to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses.\n\n363.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal notes that Attachment No. 1 to Order No. 120 requires the Chairman of the NEA to notify applicants of the NEA\u2019s decision on re-registration.721 According to Mr. Bayar\u2019s second expert report, such notice was completed by the NEA\u2019s Notices 4/1401 and 4/1402, which stated that the Claimants\u2019 Licenses \"ha[d] not been reinstated since your company has not satisfied the conditions and requirements of the law and has not pursued relevant laws and regulations in your operation.\"722 In contrast, Mr. Tsogt explained that Notices 4/1401 and 4/1402 do not actually include the decision on re-registration itself, and moreover, they give no legal bases for rejecting the application to re-register and, thus, are not decisions pursuant to Attachment No. 1 of Order No. 120.723\n\n*See* Attachment No. 1 of Order No. 120, arts. 4.3, 4.4.3, and 4.4.4, Exhibit C-95.\n\nSecond Bayar Report, \u00b6 109, referring to Notifications 4/1401 and 4/1402, Exhibits C-8, C-9.\n\nThird Tsogt Report, \u00b6 201.\n\n364.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Notices 4/1401 and 4/1402 failed to provide the Claimants with the decision that the NEA was required to provide pursuant to Attachment No. 1 of Order No. 120. As Mr. Bayar admitted during the hearing, Notices 4/1401 and 4/1402 were not decisions on reregistration: \"If you are asking if the decision was made on re-registration, I will reply no, it is not a decision on re-registration. [...] Perhaps the decision was made, but this letter is not a legal document on par with a decision, it\u2019s not a decision made pursuant to the Mongolian laws and regulations.\"724 The Respondents have not put forward any other document that could plausibly constitute a decision on re-registration. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Government never provided such a decision. This failure to provide a final decision constituted a breach of due process.\n\n*See* Transcript (14 November 2013), 667:5-18, 680:22 to 681:6.\n\n365.\n\nIn addition to the two aforementioned breaches of due process, the Tribunal also notes that the NEA did not appear to possess the authority to invalidate licenses issued under prior minerals laws.725 Under prior minerals laws, that authority was legally vested in the MRAM.726 The LPCNEL gives the NEA the authority to determine whether licenses issued under prior mineral laws would be re-registered under the NEL, but it does not appear to give the NEA the authority to invalidate those same licenses.727 If the NEA did not possess the authority to invalidate, through Order No. 141, all mineral licenses issued under prior minerals laws, this *ultra vires* action would mean that Order No. 141 itself did not conform with the LPCNEL.\n\n*See* NEA Notification No. 447 (8 October 2009), Exhibit C-2; NEA Notification No. 448 (8 October 2009), Exhibit C-3.\n\nSecond Tsogt Report, \u00b6 154.\n\nOrder No. 141, art. 1, Exhibit R-12.\n\n**D. Conclusion on Liability**\n------------------------------\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Respondents breached their obligations toward the Claimants under Article 8.2 of the Foreign Investment Law in relation to both the Mining and Exploration Licenses. This breach of Article 8.2 of the Foreign Investment Law also means that the Respondents are liable toward Khan Netherlands under the ECT through operation of the umbrella clause, Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n**X. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS ON QUANTUM**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n367.\n\nThe Tribunal will now determine the damages caused to the Claimants by the Respondents\u2019 breach of the Foreign Investment Law and the ECT.\n\n**A. Principles to be Applied**\n-------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nThe starting point of any quantum analysis is to identify the principles to be applied when assessing damages. In the present case, the liability of the Respondents having been established under the Foreign Investment Law - a Mongolian statute - and the ECT - an international treaty - the relevant damages principles are to be derived from these two instruments, as well as both Mongolian and customary international law.\n\n369.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the customary international law principles set out in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case apply, as neither the ECT nor Mongolian law set out a specific standard of compensation for illegal expropriation.728 The Respondents also refer to the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 412-414, 424.\n\n370.\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory* establishes that the purpose of compensation under international law is to \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"729 The Claimants alternatively describe this standard as \"address[ing] a hypothetical future situation that would have existed, in all probability, but for the illegal conduct\"730 and assert that, in this case, it amounts to \"fair market value.\"731\n\n*Case concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germany v. Poland), Jurisdiction, Judgment, 26 July 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 9, Exhibit CLA-173 (p. 47).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 91 (emphasis by the Claimants).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 91.\n\n371.\n\nIn addition, the Respondents refer to Article 8(4) of the Foreign Investment Law, which provides that \"the amount of compensation shall be determined by the value of the expropriated assets at the time of expropriation or public notice of expropriation.\"732 This is essentially also a \"fair market value\" standard.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 393-394.\n\n372.\n\nAs noted by the Respondents, \"fair market value\" is defined by the World Bank as:\n\nAn amount that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing seller after taking into account the nature of the investment, the circumstances in which it would operate in the future and its specific characteristics, including the period in which it has been in existence, the proportion of tangible assets in the total investment and other relevant factors pertinent to the specific circumstances of each case.733\n\n*See* Respondents\u2019 Statement of Defence, \u00b6 446.\n\n373.\n\nAs will be seen below, the Parties disagree on the most appropriate methodology to be used to assess the fair market value of the Claimants\u2019 investment in the present case.734\n\nIn addition to the question of compensation for illegal expropriation, the Claimants also state that the 2002 Civil Code creates an obligation by a person who causes damages to compensate for such damages (Article 497.1), including for lost income (Articles 227 and 229). The Claimants summarise Mongolian laws on compensation as aiming to \"put Claimants in a position they would have been in if the Agreements had properly been performed and the [Mining and Exploration] [L]icenses had not been illegally invalidated.\" Claimants\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 92; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 416, 419, referring to 2002 Civil Code, Exhibit CLA-117. The Respondents state that only \"inevitable\" lost income may be awarded under Article 227 of the 2002 Civil Code and that their legal expert, Mr. Bayar, explained that this would require a history of profit to be demonstrated. Statement of Defence, \u00b6 396, referring to First Bayar Report, \u00b6 134.\n\n374.\n\nThe Claimants advocate a Valuation Date of 1 July 2009, which is at the end of the quarter during which the DFS was issued, nine days before the Mining License was first suspended, and 44 days before the NEL was enacted.735 The Respondents do not dispute this suggested date.736\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 23.\n\n*See* Respondents\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 103.\n\n375.\n\nThe burden of proof falls on the Claimants to show that they have suffered the loss they claim. The standard of proof required is the balance of probabilities. This, of course, means that damages cannot be speculative or uncertain. However, scientific certainty is not required and it is widely acknowledged by investment treaty tribunals and publicists that the assessment of damages is often a difficult exercise and will usually involve some degree of estimation and the weighing of competing (but equally legitimate) facts, valuation methods and opinions, which does not of itself mean that the burden of proof has not been satisfied.\n\n**B. Causation**\n----------------\n\n376.\n\nThe Respondents have suggested that causation between the violations of international and Mongolian law and any loss has not been proven in the present case because there is no evidence that the Claimants could have taken the mine into profitability. Consequently, the Respondents argue that the Claimants\u2019 investment had no value and no damages should be awarded (or, at most, compensation should be limited to the investment already made by the Claimants).737\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 354; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 233, 259.\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree. While there may have been a number of uncertainties that needed to be overcome by the Claimants before the mine could come into production - as discussed below - the fact that the Dornod Project itself had a considerable inherent value as at the Valuation Date is clear from the DFS. The Claimants\u2019 investment in the Dornod Project therefore also had value, as acknowledged by the Respondents when they stated that \"[t]he Claimants had always sold off their interests after carrying out exploration in the past, and the reality is that [they] expected to do the same here.\"738\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 240.\n\n378.\n\nThe Claimants clearly would have realised value from selling their interest in the Dornod Project to a willing buyer. As noted above, this reflects the definition of fair market value -what a willing buyer would have paid the Claimants for the mine on the Valuation Date. Moreover, the Claimants have provided examples of other companies in similar situations that have taken similar projects through to production and therefore the Tribunal accepts that this may well have occurred in the present case. In any case, whether Khan would have sold the mine or developed it to production is not the issue at hand. The issue is what the mine\u2019s market value was on the Valuation Date - prior to the Respondents\u2019 breaches.\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider the fact that the Exploration License over the Additional Property had not yet been converted into a mining license to be a causation issue, as suggested by the Respondents. It is clear that, under Mongolian law, a mining license will be granted provided the requisite conditions are met. The evidence in the record demonstrates that the requisite conditions *were* being met.739 The Tribunal finds that Khan Mongolia was taking the relevant steps and that, had the Mongolian Government not decided to abandon the project in favour of working with Russian partners, a mining license over the Additional Property would likely have been granted in due course.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants\u2019 legal expert, Mr. Tsogt, that the conditions for the conversion of an exploration license into a mining license were that the applicant: (i) hold an exploration license; (ii) be a legal person formed and operating under the laws of Mongolia; (iii) pay the applicable annual fee; and (iv) submit a final report on the results of the exploration work, including an estimate of the ore reserve. *See* Second Tsogt Report \u00b6\u00b6 35-48, referring to 2007 Minerals Law, Exhibit CLA-140, arts. 10.2, 12.2, 17.1, 17.2, 18, 22, 24, 25.1, 39; *see also* Third Tsogt Report, \u00b6\u00b6 118-124. Conditions (i), (ii), (ii) were met. *See* Certificate of Registration of Khan Mongolia, 7 May 2003, Exhibit C-234; Certificate of Registration for Khan Mongolia, 12 October 2006, endorsement of 29 May 2012, Exhibit C-235; Certificate of Mineral Exploration License, 19 December 2006, endorsements, Exhibit R-6. As for condition (iv), Khan Mongolia took the requisite steps to register the ore reserves. As described in paragraphs 329-334 above, the registration did not take place due to the inaction of the Government.\n\n380.\n\nSimilarly, the fact that licenses over the Main Property and the Additional Property were held separately at the time does not mean that the venture had no value. If the two properties needed to be mined together to be economic (as both Parties agree),740 a willing buyer would clearly have wished to purchase both properties. The fact that no formal merger had taken place by July 2009 does not prevent a valuation being undertaken of the Claimants\u2019 overall investment in Mongolia (although, as discussed below, it is a factor when considering which methodology may be appropriate for valuating the project).\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 378-379; Reply, \u00b6 380.\n\n381.\n\nThe other issues raised by the Respondents as going to \"causation\" *(e.g.,* whether financing would have been raised or whether a new joint venture agreement was needed) are relevant to assessing the correct methodology, but do not demonstrate that the Dornod Project had no intrinsic market value as at the Valuation Date. The Tribunal takes these factors into account below.\n\n382.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal finds that, in the light of the DFS, the Respondents\u2019 primary position that Khan\u2019s investment in the Dornod Project was of no value at all is untenable.\n\n**C. Ownership Percentage**\n---------------------------\n\n383.\n\nBefore considering the methodology for calculating damages and the specific amount of any loss suffered by the Claimants, it is pertinent to clarify the percentage of the Claimants\u2019 interest in the Dornod Project for the loss of which compensation is due.\n\n384.\n\nAs at the Valuation Date, Khan Canada and CAUC Holding owned 58 percent of CAUC (which held the Mining Licence over the Main Property), while Khan Netherlands owned 75 percent of Khan Mongolia (which held the Exploration Licence over the Additional Property), with the remaining 25 percent being held by Khan Bermuda (and, through it, by Khan Canada).\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 expert, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Alberro (of BRG), assumed that this meant that the Claimants held 58 percent of the interest in the resources of the Main Property and 100 percent in the resources of the Additional Property, and, based on the resources available in each property, concluded that the Claimants had an interest in 68 percent of the total resources found in the two properties.741 The Respondents\u2019 expert, Mr. Lagerberg, provided three alternative calculations, using ownership figures of 58, 62 and 68 percent.742 Mr. Lagerberg arrived at the ownership percentage of 62 on the basis that the Claimants are only entitled to claim damages for 75 percent of the resources of the Additional Property, as this represents Khan Netherlands\u2019 interest (through Khan Mongolia) and therefore the percentage interest subject to an ECT claim. The third figure of 58 percent was based on the assumption that the Claimants\u2019 interest in CAUC would have remained unchanged if the Additional Property had been merged into the CAUC joint venture *(i.e.,* the merger of the two properties would have occurred without any alteration to the shareholding percentages of the three joint venture partners or any other compensation to the Claimants).743\n\nFirst BRG Report, Figure 3 (p. 12).\n\nSecond Lagerberg Report, \u00b6\u00b6 5.39, 9.66.\n\nSecond Lagerberg Report, \u00b6 5.39.\n\n386.\n\nThe damages assessment is being made as at 1 July 2009, before any formal merger had taken place. Given that at the Valuation Date Khan (that is, Khan Canada, CAUC Holding and Khan Netherlands) had an interest in 68 percent of the resources of the two properties, and given that it is impossible to know the percentages that may have been agreed had the properties been formally merged after July 2009, the Tribunal considers that, as a starting point, 68 percent is the appropriate adjustment to apply. Consequently, the Tribunal does not consider Mr. Lagerberg\u2019s third alternative of 58 percent to be appropriate.\n\n387.\n\nThe only remaining issue, therefore, is whether, under the ECT, the Claimants can only recover 75 percent of the value of the Additional Property, being the percentage owned by Khan Netherlands. If so, the overall percentage of the two properties for which the Claimants could seek damages would be reduced to 62 percent.\n\n388.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the ECT provides that the controlling investor is entitled to 100 percent of the damages in relation to the covered investment, even if the remainder of the investment is not owned by an entity covered by the ECT.744 The basis for this argument appears to be that the Exploration License itself would qualify as an investment under the ECT by virtue of being indirectly controlled by Khan Netherlands through its majority shareholding in Khan Mongolia - *i.e.,* the licence is a covered investment, not just the shares in Khan Mongolia.745 This reasoning, however, does not automatically lead to the conclusion - as the Claimants appear to assume - that Khan Netherlands can claim for 100 percent of the loss of an investment in which it only has a 75 percent interest. Principles of reparation in international law, as set out in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory,* are clear that a claimant is entitled to compensation for losses it has actually suffered - not for losses suffered by third parties over which the tribunal has no jurisdiction. Only express wording to the contrary in a treaty could override this fundamental principle. No such wording has been provided in the present circumstances and the Tribunal concludes it has no jurisdiction to award compensation in relation to the 25 percent interest in the licence owned by Khan Bermuda.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 111.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 111.\n\n389.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the correct ownership percentage to adopt is 62 percent (of the value of the Dornod Project).\n\n**D. Methodology to be Applied**\n--------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nThe Tribunal has been presented with three principal methodologies by the Parties: DCF, market comparables and market capitalisation. The Tribunal examines each of the methodologies below, but has ultimately come to the conclusion that - while all of them are valid and widely-used methods for valuing mines - none of these methodologies are wholly satisfactory in the present case. This conclusion is not a reflection on the expert witnesses, all of whom the Tribunal found to be helpful and professional. Ultimately, however, the Tribunal considers that the true value of Khan\u2019s investment is better reflected by the offers made for the mine or for Khan Canada\u2019s shares in and around the relevant period than by the more traditional methodologies advanced by the Parties.\n\n**1. DCF**\n----------\n\n391.\n\nThe Claimants advocated using a DCF method, which they state is appropriate for determining the fair market value of a mine with proven reserves.746 According to the Claimants, once these reserves are known, together with the costs associated with development and production, the market price for the relevant resource can be applied to estimate future earnings with reasonable certainty. It therefore does not matter that the mine has not actually come into full production or is not a functioning \"going concern.\" The Tribunal agrees that, in the case of a mine with proven reserves, the DCF method is often considered an appropriate methodology for calculating fair market value.747\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, p. 24.\n\n*See e.g. Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v, Ecuador,* ICSID Case No ARB/06/I I, Award, 24 September 2012, Exhibit CLA-207.\n\n392.\n\nHowever, in this particular case, there are a number of additional factors and uncertainties which, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, make the use of the DCF method unattractive and speculative. These uncertainties include:\n\n(i) how the Dornod Project would have been financed;\n\n(ii) whether a further strategic partner would have been brought into the business and, if not, whether Khan was capable of bringing the Dornod Project into production itself;\n\n(iii) whether Khan would have taken the Dornod Project through to production or sold it;\n\n(iv) when and how the Additional Property would have been merged into the CAUC joint venture to create a single \"Dornod Project\"; and\n\n(v) the signing of various agreements (an investment agreement and a new joint venture agreement) to finalise the commercial terms of the Dornod Project.\n\n393.\n\nThe combination of these factors does not mean, as the Respondents allege, that the Dornod Project had no value in the Claimants\u2019 hands,748 but it does mean that the level of certainty required for the DCF method to be used has not been attained. In particular, it is far from certain: (i) whether the mine would actually have reached production; (ii) if it did, on what terms the parties would have participated in the venture; and (iii) whether the Claimants would still have been involved in the Dornod Project at all. In this context, the Tribunal finds that the DCF method is inappropriate and that any damages calculated through it would be too speculative.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 103.\n\n**2. Market comparables approach**\n----------------------------------\n\n394.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 valuation expert, Mr. Kevin J. Carter (of Raymond James), used the market comparables approach to determine the value of the Dornod Project on the Valuation Date. He considered both \"trading comparables\" and \"transaction comparables\" to arrive at an overall value of USD 245 million.749\n\nFirst Raymond James Report, p. 16; Second Raymond James Report, p. 26. *See also* Memorial, \u00b6 451; Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, pp. 29-30.\n\n395.\n\nIn his first expert report, to derive a figure based on trading comparables, Mr. Carter reduced an initial list of fifty uranium companies to what he considered to be the ten most comparable companies. He stated that:\n\nThis list was selected based on several criteria including but not limited to, project stage, resource size and quality, technical risks associated with development/operation, and recovery method. In selecting comparable companies, the public companies considered should be comparable in terms of commodity mix, geographic location, operating characteristics, growth prospects, risk profile and size.750\n\nFirst Raymond James Report, p. 12.\n\n396.\n\nMr. Carter also identified seven comparable transactions and noted that:\n\nIdeally, comparable transactions considered would be comparable with the [Dornod] Project in terms of commodity mix, geographic location, operating characteristics, growth prospects, risk profile and size.751\n\nFirst Raymond James Report, p. 12.\n\n397.\n\nThe Respondents accept that market comparables are a valid way of valuing a mine in circumstances where other more reliable data is not available. However, the Respondents state that this methodology is only as good as the comparables chosen and that, in the present case, the comparables are not truly \"comparable\" to the Dornod Project. Therefore, according to the Respondents, Mr. Carter\u2019s conclusions are unreliable.752\n\n*See e.g.* Respondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 101-105.\n\n398.\n\nAlthough Mr. Carter may have used the companies he considered most comparable to Khan, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondents\u2019 damages experts\u2019 criticisms of Mr. Carter\u2019s selection and considers that the companies and transactions chosen are not sufficiently comparable to allow the Tribunal to make a true determination of Khan\u2019s fair market value. Reasons for this conclusion include the following:\n\n(i) CAMECO, Denison Mines Corp., Paladin Energy Ltd., and Uranium One Inc -being large, producing, multi-project companies - are not appropriate comparables for Khan.\n\n(ii) With respect to the remaining six junior mining companies, the differences presented in Table 8.1 of Behre Dolbear\u2019s second report are, taken together, sufficient to cause concern as to the accuracy of any valuation based solely on those comparables.753 These differences were similarly summarised by Mr. Lagerberg at Appendix 2 of his second report.754\n\n(iii) The comparable transactions chosen suffer from similar issues, as the projects concerned were in different locations with different conditions and stages of development, all of which are factors that have a significant effect on value.755 The Tribunal is not convinced that sufficient adjustments were made - or could be made - to account for these differences.\n\n*See also* Second Behre Dolbear Report, \u00b6 43.\n\n*See also* Second Lagerberg Report, \u00b6\u00b6 4.7-4.10.\n\nSecond Lagerberg Report, \u00b6 4.13.\n\n399.\n\nOverall, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondents\u2019 observations that the comparables chosen represent \"companies whose sites are based in different countries, under varying climatic, geographical and regulatory conditions to those experienced by Khan.\"756 This is one of the key reasons why arbitral tribunals are often reluctant to rely on a comparables analysis as the sole or primary method of valuation.757 The difficulty of finding truly comparable companies in the present case makes this method unattractive.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 325.\n\n*See* *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador,* ICSID Case No ARB/06/11, Award, 24 September 2012, Exhibit CLA-207 (\u00b6 787). *See also* *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic,* Award, 27 October 2011, Exhibit CLA-172 (\u00b6 711).\n\n**3. Market capitalization or \"Quoted Market Price\" (\"QMP\") approach**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nThe market capitalization approach advocated by the Respondents on its face has much attraction. The Tribunal accepts that Khan Canada ultimately held the investment that is the subject of this dispute and that it was essentially a \"single-project\" company. The market capitalisation of Khan Canada should, therefore, reflect the market\u2019s *(i.e.,* a willing buyer\u2019s) view of the value of the company and its interest in the Dornod Project. Using this approach, Mr. Lagerberg calculated that Khan Canada\u2019s market capitalisation in April-July 2009 was between USD 14.8 and USD 20.4 million.758 Mr. Lagerberg then discounted this price to reflect the possibility that the part of the Claimants\u2019 investment for which compensation is due includes only a 75 percent interest in the Additional Property and thus arrived at his final estimate of a value between USD 13.4 and USD 18.6 million.759\n\nFirst Lagerberg Report, \u00b6 2.6; Second Lagerberg Report, \u00b6 3.18.\n\nSecond Lagerberg Report, \u00b6\u00b6 3.18-3.19.\n\n401.\n\nAbsent countervailing factors, this should be the simplest and most accurate reflection of the value of the Claimants\u2019 interest in the Dornod Project and is preferable to the approximations and estimations provided by the DCF and market comparables methodologies, which are used in the absence of an accurate valuation. The Tribunal therefore needs to consider whether, in the present case, there were other factors affecting the share price of Khan Canada as at the Valuation Date that would make it an inaccurate reflection of the value of the Dornod Project.\n\n402.\n\nThe Claimants reject a QMP approach. They argue that:\n\nTo properly apply a QMP Approach [...] there are two key requirements: first, the shares must be liquid, and, second, the share price must be analyzed in a period in which it has not been negatively impacted by the complained of measures.760\n\nReply, \u00b6 429 (footnotes omitted).\n\n403.\n\nThus, the Claimants suggest that events prior to July 2009 had created concern within the market and had unduly distressed Khan Canada\u2019s share price such that it was not an accurate indication of the investment\u2019s value. Therefore, the Respondents\u2019 illegal conduct would be taken into account if a valuation date in July 2009 were to be used for this method. In particular, the Claimants suggest that Mongolia\u2019s actions in 2007 had a lasting effect on Khan Canada\u2019s share price. Dr. Alberro observed:\n\nOn August 17 2007, Khan announced it had received a notice from the Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia (the \"Minerals Authority\") advising that the Minerals Authority had determined that the decision to issue Khan\u2019s [Exploration License] was considered invalid. Khan\u2019s share price declined 48% on the announcement with 4.8 million shares trading on that day, more than 10 times the average volume for the preceding 20 days. The market reaction reduced Khan\u2019s market capitalization by Cdn$90.0 million.761\n\nSecond BRG Report, \u00b6 9.\n\n404.\n\nThe Claimants also state that the market in July 2009 was \"illiquid,\" making a QMP approach inappropriate. In the event that a QMP approach is used, the Claimants advocate a valuation date in early August 2007, which, in the Claimants\u2019 view, would ensure that no negative effect of the Government\u2019s temporary invalidation of the licences in 2007 would be included in the valuation.762\n\nReply, \u00b6 435.\n\n405.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined the movements of Khan Canada\u2019s share price and cannot see any permanent impact on it of the temporary invalidation of the licences in August 2007. The Tribunal accepts the Respondents\u2019 position that none of the ECT and Foreign Investment Law violations complained of by the Claimants had occurred prior to 1 July 2009. In principle, therefore, there is no reason to shift the share price two years earlier to August 2007, at which time the short-lived \"uranium bubble\" artificially inflated the value of the Dornod Project.\n\n406.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal that the share price of uranium companies generally fell in late 2007 as the so-called \"uranium bubble\" burst and the global credit crisis began. The movement of Khan Canada\u2019s share price at this time seems consistent with that of other uranium companies. The graph on page 58 of the Rejoinder clearly demonstrates this trend.763\n\n*See also* First Behre Dolbear Report, pp. 13-15.\n\n407.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does have concerns that the QMP approach produces a valuation for the Claimants\u2019 interests in the Dornod Project that bears little or no relation to the inherent value of the project as set out in the DFS.764 This may mean that, when the DFS was released in April 2009, the market was indeed already suspicious of Mongolia\u2019s motives and therefore approached Khan Canada cautiously or that, as argued by the Claimants, the \"illiquid\" nature of the market at the time makes the approach unreliable.\n\nThe DFS provided an independent assessment of the value of the Dornod Project as at April 2009 of USD 275.9 million. Exhibit C-50. The Claimants also note that a valuation by World Growth Mongolia in January 2009 assessed the value as USD 382.9 million. Reply, \u00b6 377, referring to Exhibit C-470.\n\n408.\n\nWhatever the reason, it seems clear from the contemporaneous offers discussed below that a willing buyer in or around the relevant time was willing to pay much more for Khan\u2019s investment than suggested by the Respondents\u2019 QMP approach. The Respondents have not been able to offer any persuasive evidence to explain why their proposed value as at July 2009 (before the expropriation) was lower than the later offers by ARMZ and CNNC in November 2009 and February 2010 (after the expropriation). Faced with this reality, the Tribunal does not consider that the valuation advanced by the Respondents reflects the true market value of the investment. The Tribunal therefore accepts the Claimants\u2019 position that, as of July 2009, the market price of Khan did not reflect the intrinsic value of the Dornod Project.\n\n409.\n\nIn any case, if the Respondents\u2019 contention that the Dornod Project had no value in the Claimants\u2019 hands is put aside, both Parties acknowledge that the minimum that the Claimants would be entitled to receive as compensation for any expropriation is the equivalent of their investment in the Dornod Project to date.765 The Tribunal accepts that the Dornod Project had moved beyond a minimal stage of development, particularly after the release of the DFS. Consequently, a \"sunk investment\" approach is not appropriate. However, such an approach can serve as a \"bottom line\" below which compensation should not fall. Unfortunately, even the costs figure in this arbitration has proved controversial, although it seems to fall somewhere between USD 16.7 and USD 50 million. The fact that the Claimants\u2019 investment is likely to be higher than the market capitalisation calculated by the Respondents means that the QMP approach is of limited use, unless the upper end of the Respondents\u2019 range is used. Although the investment made is the minimum the Claimants should be entitled to recover, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that it is not an accurate method for ascertaining the fair value of a mine,766 and therefore the Tribunal has looked to other information in its possession.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 90 (although the Claimants argue that compensation amounting to investments made would be inappropriate as it would not equate to fair market value). *See also* Respondents\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 98, 103; Statement of Defence, \u00b6 385. The Claimants state that this form of compensation may be appropriate for an \"early stage exploration project.\" Reply, \u00b6 402.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 24.\n\n**E. Value Derived from Offers to Purchase the Dornod Project**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nAs indicated in the previous analysis, the situation that arises here is one of considerable difficulty in establishing a reasonable figure for damages. In arriving at the quantum conclusions set out in this section, the Tribunal has been guided by the following principles and conclusions:\n\n(i) The burden is on the Claimants to prove their loss. Estimating future losses will often involve some level of uncertainty or estimation, but should not be purely speculative.767\n\n(ii) As stated by Judge Greenwood in the ICJ *Case Concerning Ahmadou Sadio Diallo:*\n\n[w]hat is required is not the selection of an arbitrary figure but the application of principles which at least enable the reader of the judgment to discern the factors which led the Court to fix the sum awarded. Moreover, those principles must be capable of being applied in a consistent and coherent manner, so that the amount awarded can be regarded as just, not merely by reference to the facts of this case, but by comparison with other cases.768\n\n(iii) The Parties have agreed that the date of the valuation is 1 July 2009 and that a fair market value approach is appropriate.\n\n(iv) The costs, DCF, market comparables and QMP methods are not appropriate for the reasons set out above.\n\n(v) Having discounted these other methods, the only remaining material on the basis of which the Tribunal might estimate fair market value is the various offers that were made between 2005 and 2010 for the shares in the CAUC joint venture or Khan Canada, as set out in detail in this section.\n\n(vi) When examining this material, the Tribunal is mindful of the comments of Sergey Ripinsky and Kevin Williams in *Damages in International Investment Law :*\n\nValuation can be performed on the basis of past transactions with the evaluated asset itself. Such transactions, whether actually executed or only contemplated by the parties at arm\u2019s length, represent strong evidence of the asset\u2019s [fair market value], provided that no value-affecting factors have interfered between the date of the transaction and the valuation date.769\n\n*Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo),* Compensation, Judgment, 19 June 2012, ICJ Reports 2012, p. 324, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 49; *Lusitania cases,* Opinion, 1 November 1923, Reports of International Arbitral Awards, vol. VII, p. 32 at p. 40.\n\n*Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo),* Declaration of Judge Greenwood appended to Compensation Judgment, 19 June 2012, \u00b6 7.\n\nSergey Ripinsky and Kevin Williams, Damages in International Investment Law (2008), p. 216.\n\n411.\n\nHence, the three offers made to acquire the shares in the Dornod Project during the relevant period are the best information presented to the Tribunal in terms of the real value of the Claimants\u2019 investment. The two most relevant offers time-wise are the offers made in late 2009 and early 2010 by ARMZ and CNNC respectively. ARMZ was already a minority shareholder of Khan Canada and made a hostile takeover bid in November 2009 for the remaining shares at approximately CAD 0.65 per share.770 This resulted in an overall offer of USD 33 million (net-of-cash USD 18.2 million).771 Mr. Lagerberg calculated that this offer included a 44 percent control premium.772\n\nPress Release, \"Khan Board of Directors Recommends Shareholders Reject ARMZ\u2019s Highly Inadequate and Prejudicial Offer,\" 15 December 2009, Exhibit C-202.\n\nFirst Lagerberg Report, \u00b6 5.16; Respondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 105, 124.\n\nFirst Lagerberg Report, \u00b6 5.10.\n\n412.\n\nThe offer made in February 2010 by CNNC was for all shares in Khan Canada. The offer was made at CAD 0.96 per share and, on Mr. Lagerberg\u2019s calculation, included a control premium of around 33 percent.773 The total offer for all shares was USD 53 million (net-of-cash USD 39.1 million).774 Mr. Lagerberg speculated that CNNC\u2019s offer may have been higher due to synergies that the company was hoping to achieve.775 However, the Tribunal has been presented with no evidence or detail as to such synergies. Given that the control premium seems to have been smaller in the CNNC offer, the Tribunal finds no evidence to support a contention that the price was unduly inflated.\n\nDirector\u2019s Circular Recommending Acceptance of CNNC\u2019s Offer, 25 February 2010, Exhibit C-259 (p. ii); First Lagerberg Report, \u00b6 5.10.\n\nFirst Lagerberg Report, \u00b6\u00b6 5.10-5.16; Respondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 105, 124.\n\nFirst Lagerberg Report, \u00b6 5.18.\n\n413.\n\nThe ARMZ offer was rejected by Khan\u2019s shareholders, but the CNNC offer was accepted (although it did not progress due to a failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals from Chinese authorities). Of course, these offers were made after the expropriatory acts had taken place and were thus made in a distressed environment. The fair market value of the investment must therefore be presumed to be higher than the CNNC offer. As stated by the Claimants, these offers provide only \"a very conservative baseline\"776 for the value of the Dornod Project which, when assessed from a willing buyer / willing seller perspective would have been higher.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 95.\n\n414.\n\nThe only other evidence of offers to acquire the Dornod Project is the Government\u2019s offer to sell to Khan Canada its 21 percent shareholding in CAUC in November 2005. This offer is obviously more distant time-wise. It was also made before proven reserves had been confirmed in the DFS. However, it has the advantage of having been made well before there was any hint of the expropriatory acts (including the 2007 temporary invalidation of the licences) and of not being affected by the \"uranium bubble\" of 2007. The offer represented a valuation of Mongolia\u2019s 21 percent shareholding agreed after almost a year of negotiation. The agreed value was USD 31.5 million.777 Dr. Alberro calculated that this translates to an overall value for CAUC of USD 150 million (being USD 31.5 million / 21 percent).778 The Tribunal accepts Dr. Alberro\u2019s explanation that the offer for Mongolia\u2019s CAUC shares was exclusive of the USD 50 million capital cost that Khan had agreed to finance in addition to payment of the sum of USD 31.5 million for the 21 percent interest in CAUC. There is therefore no basis on which to deduct the USD 50 million from the agreed price as suggested by Mr. Lagerberg.779\n\nLetter from Khan Canada to Mr. Sukhbaatar Batbold, 5 November 2004, Exhibit BRG-82.\n\nSecond Alberro Report, \u00b6 58.\n\n*See* Letter from Khan Canada to Mr. Sukhbaatar Batbold, 5 November 2004, Exhibit BRG-82; Second Alberro Report, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60; First Lagerberg Report, \u00b6 3.20.\n\n415.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that the offer of 2005 is conservative because at that time no definitive feasibility study had yet been completed and the long term uranium price was approximately one third (USD 22 per pound) of that in 2009 (USD 65 per pound in the Claimants\u2019 case). However, the Tribunal also accepts that market conditions were less favourable in 2009, which would have affected a prospective buyer\u2019s ability to raise finance and other important factors related to value. A prospective buyer would also face the uncertainties of attempting to merge the Main Property and the Additional Property and of negotiating new agreements with the other joint venture owners (uncertainties which made the DCF model unattractive). Therefore, because there are factors which suggest both better and worse conditions in 2009 for a sale, the Tribunal has decided to make no adjustments to the 2005 figure. Any attempt to adjust the figure up or down to account for other factors would be speculative.\n\n416.\n\nThe 2005 offer provides a value for the CAUC joint venture and therefore the overall value derived from this offer does not include the Claimants\u2019 interest in the Additional Property, which included part of the resources in Deposit No. 2. The Tribunal accepts that the 2005 Mongolia offer suggests that the Additional Property would provide a further USD 50 million of value, equating to an overall value for the two properties of around USD 200 million.780\n\n*See* Reply, \u00b6 377, n. 803.\n\n417.\n\nIn order to estimate the value of the Claimants\u2019 investments in the two properties, the overall value must be divided by the percentage of the resources for which the Claimants are entitled to compensation. As discussed above, the appropriate percentage to represent the Claimants\u2019 investment in the Dornod Project is 62 percent, yielding on the basis of the 2005 offer a value of USD 124 million.\n\n418.\n\nIn this case, all three offers suffer from clear \"value-affecting factors\" and therefore an adjustment would need to be made to reflect the change in value between July 2009 and the date of any given offer. As such, the value of the Dornod Project as at the Valuation Date cannot be determined precisely, but this does not mean a fair value cannot be determined at all. Rather, the Tribunal has used its best efforts to balance these issues and arrive at a damages estimate that it considers reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n419.\n\nHaving examined the offers carefully, the Tribunal considers that the offer that most closely approximates the fair value of the Claimants\u2019 investment as at July 2009 is CNNC\u2019s offer of February 2010, for the following reasons:\n\n(i) The offer is sufficiently close temporally to the Valuation Date for the Tribunal to be satisfied that general market conditions would not have altered so significantly as to considerably affect valuation.\n\n(ii) The value of Khan Canada\u2019s shares improved following the ARMZ offer and, unlike the ARMZ offer, the CNNC offer was not a hostile takeover bid motivated by an apparent desire to further an alternative joint venture between the Russian and the Mongolian Governments.\n\n(iii) The offer was acceptable to Khan Canada\u2019s shareholders.\n\n(iv) By the time CNNC made its offer, the 2010 MOU had been signed between the Claimants and the Mongolian Government, which would suggest that the investment was less distressed than it was when the ARMZ offer was made (although the 2010 MOU was rejected by the NEA before the offer was formally announced to the market).\n\n(v) When the CNNC offer was made, steps were being taken to register the proven reserves.\n\n(vi) The CNNC offer was made by a Chinese investor that had no prior investment in the Dornod Project. CNNC must therefore have been satisfied that it could persuade the Government to re-register the licenses.\n\n420.\n\nClearly, however, despite the efforts of Khan Canada to work with the Mongolian Government to restore the licences, the investment remained in a distressed state. A fair market value as at July 2009 must take into account the actions of the NEA between July 2009 and January 2010, and the valuation must be adjusted to remove the impact of such actions. To do this, the valuation derived from the 2005 offer is informative. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the 2005 offer -which was made almost four years prior to the Valuation Date - is too distant to serve as the basis for assessing fair value in July 2009. Market conditions, both generally and in relation to uranium, altered significantly in the period from 2005 to 2009. However, the value of the Claimants\u2019 investment in 2005 (USD 124 million) and the value of the proven reserves as estimated in the DFS (net present value of USD 276 million, which would result in the Claimants\u2019 investment being valued at USD 171 million) are informative when assessing the adjustment that should be made to the CNNC offer. Both valuations suggest that CNNC would have acquired the investment at a significant discount had its purchase been approved by the relevant Chinese regulatory authorities.\n\n421.\n\nTaking all of the above into account, the Tribunal considers that the fair value of the Claimants\u2019 investment as at July 2009 is USD 80 million. The Tribunal has applied a 100 percent adjustment factor to the CNNC offer to eliminate the effects of the Respondents\u2019 actions post-July 2009. The figure takes into account the considerable challenges and uncertainties that would face a new investor in order to realise the value of the proven reserves at Dornod. It also takes into account the Claimants\u2019 prior investment into the Dornod Project and the fact that considerable further investment would have been needed. The Tribunal considers this figure to provide fair and reasonable compensation to the Claimants for the loss of their investment. It reflects the Tribunal\u2019s best and conscientious effort at assessing the fair value of the Claimants\u2019 investments immediately prior to the Government\u2019s illegal acts.\n\n**F. INTEREST**\n---------------\n\n422.\n\nThe Respondents do not dispute that, if damages are awarded to the Claimants, the Claimants would be entitled to interest on those damages. The Respondents also do not dispute that the minimum standard on which interest should be awarded is at a \"commercially reasonable rate,\"781 the underlying principle being that interest is required to effect \"full reparation\" for the breach and therefore should be applied from the date of expropriation.782\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 460.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 458.\n\n423.\n\nThe Claimants have argued that they have effectively been forced to take an involuntary loan from the Government and that the Respondents\u2019 borrowing rate of 7.14 percent is therefore the appropriate interest rate to apply. The Claimants request interest on a compounding basis.783\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 458, 461; Reply, \u00b6 481.\n\n424.\n\nThe Respondents state that interest should be simple and awarded at a commercial rate of LIBOR or, at most, LIBOR plus 1 or 2 percent. The Respondents note that the Claimants\u2019 approach has been rejected by most ICSID tribunals as not being commercially reasonable.784\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 482; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 402-403; Respondents\u2019 Pre-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 156; Respondents\u2019 First Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 128.\n\n425.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondents that the interest rate requested by the Claimants is too high and that using Mongolia\u2019s borrowing rate is not equivalent to a \"commercially reasonable rate.\" The Tribunal considers that an interest rate based on LIBOR plus a small percentage reflects a commercially reasonable borrowing rate over the relevant period. This view is consistent with recent practice amongst ICSID tribunals and the prevailing scholarly view. It is also consistent with recent practice to compound interest, rather than to award it on a simple basis (as used to be the prevailing view).785\n\n*See e.g. Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v, Ecuador,* ICSID Case No ARB/06/11, Award, 24 September 2012, Exhibit CLA-207; *Wena Elotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award, 8 December 2000, Exhibit RL-125 (\u00b6 129).\n\n426.\n\nTaking the above into account, the Tribunal concludes that a commercially reasonable interest rate would be LIBOR plus 2 percent. The Tribunal therefore orders that interest be calculated at a rate of LIBOR plus 2 percent compounded annually from 1 July 2009 until the date of payment of this Award.\n\n**XI. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS ON COSTS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n427.\n\nAs set out at paragraph 283 above, the Claimants have claimed **USD 13,405,158.50** in costs. This amount is broken down as follows:\n\n(i) Legal costs: USD 6,991,731.82, consisting of legal fees already paid of USD 3,748,171.82, plus a success fee to be paid of USD 3,243,560;\n\n(ii) Expenses incurred by the Claimants\u2019 legal counsel: USD 530,680.20;\n\n(iii) Expert witness costs (fees and travel): USD 1,112,271.96;\n\n(iv) Other arbitration expenses paid by the Claimants, including vendor charges and expenses for duplicating, translating, etc., costs associated with counsel, client and witness travel and paying factual witnesses for their time and expenses: USD 269,315.58. This includes payments to Mr. Arsenault of USD 125,661.05, to Ms. Davis of USD 38,650, and to Dr. Jamsrandorj of USD 20,800;\n\n(v) \"Other costs\" specified as the costs of keeping the Khan companies running while the arbitration was continuing, including the cost of salaries, accounting services, insurance, office expenses and investor relations: USD 4,093,404.12; and\n\n(vi) Costs of the arbitration: USD 407,754.82.786\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, p. 2.\n\n**B. THE UNCITRAL RULES**\n-------------------------\n\n428.\n\nThis arbitration is governed by the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n429.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules states, in relevant part, that:\n\n1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision.\n\n2. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n[...]\n\n430.\n\nArticle 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules states that:\n\n1. The costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.\n\n431.\n\nThe text of UNCITRAL Rules clearly evidences a presumption in relation to the costs of the arbitration that such costs will follow the event, *i.e.,* that the successful party is entitled to recover from the unsuccessful party the costs of the arbitration which the former has incurred. In relation to the costs of legal representation, no such presumption exists and the Tribunal is free to determine the allocation of such costs at its discretion, subject to the requirement that they are reasonable. Of course, the Tribunal\u2019s wide discretion in relation to legal costs includes the discretionary power to order that such costs will also follow the event, *i.e.,* that the amount of the successful party\u2019s legal costs will be recovered from the unsuccessful party.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. Costs of the arbitration**\n-------------------------------\n\n432.\n\nIn relation to the costs of the arbitration, having considered the Parties\u2019 submissions in detail, the Tribunal concludes that there are no extraordinary factors that would cause it to depart from the presumption that costs follow the event. The Claimants were the successful party in the merits phase of the arbitration. There are no countervailing circumstances that suggest that the Claimants should not be compensated for these costs. In particular, the Tribunal does not find that either the Claimants or the Respondents acted inappropriately in their conduct of the arbitration. As such, it is appropriate that costs should follow the event as provided in Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules and that the Claimants should be able to recover their share of the costs of the arbitration as the ultimately successful party.\n\n433.\n\nThe Parties deposited with the PCA a total of EUR 700,000 (EUR 350,000 from each side) for this arbitration. The PCA has determined that the final costs of the arbitration are EUR 634,882.37, including the fees of the arbitral tribunal, which, in accordance with Article 40(2)(a) and Article 41 of the UNCITRAL Rules, are fixed as follows:\n\n(i) Professor David A. R. Williams Q.C. \u2014 EUR 189,006.89;\n\n(ii) Dr. Bernard Hanotiau \u2014 EUR 131,781.13; and\n\n(iii) The Hon. L. Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC \u2014 EUR 126,999.42.\n\n434.\n\nThe PCA\u2019s fees and expenses for registry services amount to EUR 94,481.72.\n\n435.\n\nOther Tribunal costs, including for hearing facilities, court reporters, interpreters, courier expenses, bank costs, communication expenses and supplies, amount to EUR 92,613.21.\n\n436.\n\nAccordingly, the costs of the arbitration, including all items set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (f) of Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules amount to EUR 634,882.37, or USD 710,510.00.\n\n437.\n\nThe Tribunal orders that the Claimants\u2019 share of the costs of the arbitration (being USD 355,255.00) be borne by the Respondents.\n\n438.\n\nThe unexpended balance of the deposit shall be returned to the Parties in accordance with Article 43(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules and Section 6.4 of the Terms of Reference.\n\n**2. Legal and other costs**\n----------------------------\n\n439.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal has wide discretion to decide on how to allocate the legal and other costs incurred by the successful party, if at all.\n\n440.\n\nThe Claimants were largely successful in their claims. Because of this success, the Tribunal, in its discretion, considers that the Claimants should be entitled to recover at least some of their reasonable legal and related costs in the present case.\n\n441.\n\nSpecifically, the Tribunal finds that the costs claimed by the Claimants in relation to expert evidence (USD 1,112,271.96) are reasonable. The Tribunal also finds that the disbursements incurred by the Claimants\u2019 legal counsel (USD 530,680.20) are reasonable. While the Respondents have noted that these disbursements are considerably larger than their own,787 this is not uncommon in an international arbitration where the claimant often produces a much larger amount of documents and is responsible for preparation of materials for the hearing. The Tribunal therefore orders that the Claimants should be entitled to recover from the Respondents these costs, together amounting to USD 1,642,952.16.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Letter to the Tribunal, dated 15 April 2014, p. 3.\n\n442.\n\nThe Claimants have also claimed approximately USD 4 million in other costs related to the costs of keeping Khan Canada and related entities running - such as salaries, insurance, office expenses, investor relations costs etc. - while the arbitration was continuing. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondents that these costs do not fall within any of the categories set out in Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.788 They are, therefore, not recoverable. In particular, the cost of running these companies is not a \"legal and other cost[] incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration,\"789 as suggested by the Claimants.790\n\nRespondents\u2019 Letter to the Tribunal, dated 15 April 2014, p. 1.\n\nArticle 40(2)(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, p. 3.\n\n443.\n\nThe Tribunal also does not consider that the cost of time spent by witnesses in preparing witness statements or preparing and attending the hearing is recoverable under Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Claimants confirmed that three of their factual witnesses (being those no longer employed by Khan entities) were reimbursed for their time in preparing statements and attending the hearing.791 These costs amount to USD 185,111.05. The Tribunal finds that the Claimants are not entitled to reimbursement of these costs.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter to the Tribunal, dated 8 May 2014, p. 2.\n\n444.\n\nOther expenses claimed by the Claimants amount to USD 84,204.53 (being USD 269,315.58 minus USD 185,111.05). The Claimants have stated that these expenses relate to vendor charges, additional duplication costs, translation costs and travel expenses for witnesses, all of which fall within Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.792 The Tribunal therefore orders that the Claimants are entitled to recover these costs, which it finds reasonable, from the Respondents.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, p. 2.\n\n445.\n\nThe final issue concerns the Claimants\u2019 costs of legal representation. This is an issue only because of the success fee arrangement that the Claimants have entered into with their legal representatives. The Tribunal notes that the time spent by counsel for the Claimants (which would have incurred a fee of approximately USD 5.7 million if it had charged at the firm\u2019s normal rates) is reasonable. This is additionally confirmed by the fact that the time for which this amount is being claimed is similar to that spent by counsel for the Respondents.\n\n446.\n\nThe Claimants have confirmed that they will be liable to pay the success fee if a favourable award is rendered. A favourable award was said to \"involve a decision of the Tribunal confirming the liability of Respondents resulting in an award of damages.\"793\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter to the Tribunal, dated 8 May 2014, p. 2.\n\n447.\n\nCounsel for the Claimants has provided a redacted copy of the agreed fee arrangement. On the basis of the information before it, the Tribunal is satisfied that the decisions rendered in this Award will result in the Claimants being liable to pay the success fee to its counsel. Although this is not a fee that has been \"incurred\" to date as required by Article 40(2)(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules, it is a fee that the Claimants have already incurred a legal obligation to pay. The Tribunal thus finds that it is recoverable under this same provision. Moreover, creating a distinction between \"incurred and paid\" fees and fees for which the liability has been incurred seems artificial, given that the Tribunal could, in theory, render a partial award on liability and quantum, followed by a separate costs award that would include the paid success fee. The same conclusion was reached in *Siag v Egypt,794*\n\n*Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award (1 June 2009), \u00b6 604: \"Because of the Claimants\u2019 financial circumstances they had asked, and the Claimants\u2019 counsel had agreed, that the Claimants will pay attorney\u2019s fees only on a successful recovery in this matter. It was argued that since the Claimants were contractually obligated to pay such fees, they should be entitled to an award of fees equal to the value of the time worked by their counsel [even though no fees had yet been paid]\" and \u00b6 625: the tribunal awarded the claimants their legal costs, which it found to be reasonable.\n\n448.\n\nThe Respondents\u2019 primary objection to the success fee was that details of the fee arrangement were not fully disclosed by the Claimants.795 The Respondents did not object to the legality of the fee arrangement or the reasonableness of the arrangement itself. Although the Respondents retained their disclosure objection following the provision of further information by the Claimants - including the provision of a redacted fee agreement letter - the Tribunal, as noted above, considers that sufficient detail and evidence of the success fee arrangement has now been provided by the Claimants. There is therefore no basis on which the Respondents\u2019 continued disclosure objection can be sustained.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Letter to the Tribunal, dated 15 April 2014, p. 1-2.\n\n449.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal orders that the Claimants are entitled to recover legal costs in the amount of USD 6,991,731.82.\n\n450.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal therefore finds and declares that the Claimants are entitled to be paid by the Respondents a total of USD 9,074,143.51, calculated as follows:\n\nArbitration costs USD 355,255.00  \nExpert costs USD 1,112,271.96  \nDisbursements USD 530,680.20  \nOther costs USD 84,204.53  \nLegal costs USD 6,991,731.82\n\nTotal: USD 9,074,143.51\n\n**XII.
