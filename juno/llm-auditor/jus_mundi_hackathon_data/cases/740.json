PROCEEDINGS***\n--------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn September 11, 2002, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received from Mr. R. Doak Bishop a Request for Arbitration under the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\") on behalf of Sempra Energy International (\"Sempra\") against the Argentine Republic. The request relates to disputes with the Argentine Republic regarding measures adopted by the Argentine authorities which, it is argued, have changed the general regulatory framework established for foreign investors in a way which the Claimant asserts severely affects Sempra\u2019s investment in two natural gas distribution companies which together serve seven Argentine provinces. In its request, Sempra invokes the provisions contained in the 1991 treaty between Argentina and the United States concerning the reciprocal encouragement and protection of investment (the \"Bilateral Investment Treaty\" of the \"BIT\").1\n\nTreaty between the United States and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment of 1991, in force since October 20, 1994\n\n2.\n\nOn September 12, 2002, in accordance with Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), the Centre acknowledged receipt of the request and, on September 13, 2002, sent copies thereof to the Argentine Republic and to the Embassy of Argentina in Washington, D.C.\n\n3.\n\nOn October 25, 2002, the Centre asked the Claimant to submit additional information regarding some references in its request for arbitration regarding certain claims before tax authorities and before the Supreme Court of Justice. By communications of October 28 and November 5, 2002, the Claimant gave response to this request.\n\n4.\n\nOn December 6, 2002, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On the same date, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the request and invited them to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n5.\n\nOn March 4, 2003, the Claimant and the Respondent agreed to set up a single Tribunal to hear Sempra\u2019s request for arbitration and another request submitted concurrently by Camuzzi International S.A. (\"Camuzzi\"), also a shareholder in the gas distribution companies. Camuzzi\u2019s request would be decided on separately. The parties also agreed that the Tribunal would comprise one arbitrator appointed jointly by Sempra and Camuzzi, one arbitrator appointed by the Argentine Republic, and a third arbitrator, who would serve as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal, who would be appointed by the Secretary-General of ICSID.\n\n6.\n\nOn 10 March 2003, the Claimant appointed Mr. Marc Lalonde, a Canadian national, as an arbitrator. On April 3, 2003, the Argentine Republic appointed as an arbitrator Dr. Sandra Morelli Rico, a national of Colombia.\n\n7.\n\nAfter consulting with the parties, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID appointed Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a Chilean national, as President of the Arbitral Tribunal. On May 5, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Rules of Procedure for ICSID Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), notified the parties that all the arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal had consequently been deemed to be constituted and the proceedings deemed to begun on that same date. On the same day, in accordance with Rule 25 of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal. Subsequently, by letter of July 1, 2004, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Arbitral Tribunal and the parties that Mr. Flores would be replaced by Mr. Francisco Ceballos Godinez, Counsel, ICSID. Mr. Ceballos Godinez having left ICSID in March 2004, Mr. Gonzalo Flores was reappointed as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nThe first session of the Arbitral Tribunal with the parties was held, as scheduled, on July 3, 2003, at the seat of ICSID in Washington, D.C. At that session the parties stated their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted, in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, declaring that they had no objections whatsoever in this respect.\n\n9.\n\nIn the course of the first session, the parties expressed their agreement regarding various aspects of the proceedings, as recorded in the respective minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. The Arbitral Tribunal, after having consulted with the parties, fixed the following time limits for the written part of the proceedings: The Claimant would file a memorial within ninety (90) days from the date of the first session; the Respondent would then file a counter-memorial within ninety (90) days from its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 memorial; the Claimant would file its reply within 45 (forty-five) days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial; and finally, the Respondent would file a rejoinder within 45 (forty-five) days from its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 reply. It was also agreed that the parties, if they deemed so appropriate, could submit consolidated memorials combining the claims of Sempra and Camuzzi or the arguments of the Argentine Republic regarding both claims.\n\n10.\n\nAt this first session, the Tribunal noted that, according to the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Respondent has the right to raise any objections to jurisdiction no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of its counter-memorial. For the case that the Argentine Republic were to raise objections to jurisdiction, the following schedule was agreed upon: the Claimant would file a counter-memorial on jurisdiction within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s memorial on jurisdiction; the Respondent would then file a reply on the question of jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s countermemorial; and finally, the Claimant would file a rejoinder on jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s reply.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed time limits, the Claimant submitted to the Centre its memorial on the merits, with attached documentation, on September 3, 2003. As agreed, this memorial included both the claims of Sempra and Camuzzi.\n\n12.\n\nOn December 31, 2003, the Respondent filed its memorial with objections to jurisdiction, requesting the Tribunal to declare the dispute outside ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of January 14, 2004, the Tribunal confirmed the suspension of the proceedings on the merits in accordance with Rule 41(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n14.\n\nSubsequently, on March 18, 2004, the Respondent received the Claimant\u2019s countermemorial on jurisdiction, and on May 6, 2004, the Claimant received the Respondent\u2019s reply on jurisdiction. Lastly, on June 1, 2004, the Claimant filed its rejoinder on jurisdiction. All these pleadings were made jointly with the concurrent case in respect of Camuzzi.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal, once it had received the pleadings of each of the parties, considered necessary holding a hearing on jurisdiction, which, with the agreement of the parties, took place in Paris on November 29 and 30, 2004. The Claimant was represented at the hearing by Messrs. R. Doak Bishop and Craig S. Miles (King & Spalding, Houston); Mr. Santiago F. Albarracin was also present on behalf of the Claimant. The Respondent was represented by Drs. Cintia Yaryura and Gisela Makowski and by Dr. Gabriel Bottini, all from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina. This hearing encompassed the parallel cases of Sempra and Camuzzi.\n\n16.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Bishop made an oral presentation to the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant, and so did Mr. Miles; Dr. Cintia Yaryura in turn, made an oral presentation to the Tribunal on behalf of the Respondent, as did Dr. Makowski and Dr. Bottini. The Tribunal then posed questions to the representatives of the parties, in accordance with Rule 32(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n17.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal, having considered the basic facts of the dispute, the ICSID Convention and the BIT, together with the written and oral arguments presented by the representatives of the parties, has decided as follows regarding the question on jurisdiction.\n\n**Participation of the Claimant in the privatization process**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimant in this dispute, like other companies which have submitted requests for arbitration against the Argentine Republic before ICSID, participated in a vast privatization program that the country embarked upon in 1989, which included the gas sector among others. The privatization of this sector was carried out by means of the Gas Law and related instruments.2\n\nLaw 24,076 of 1992 on the privatization of the gas sector and Decree 1738/92 of 1992 on application of the gas law.\n\n19.\n\nSempra owns 43.09% of the share capital of Sodigas Sur S.A. (\"Sodigas Sur\") and Sodigas Pampeana S.A. (\"Sodigas Pampeana\"). For its part, Camuzzi, the company which requested the concurrent arbitration proceedings mentioned above, owns 56.91% of Sodigas Sur and Sodigas Pampeana. The latter two Argentine companies, in turn, hold 90% and 86.09%, respectively, of the shares in Camuzzi Gas del Sur S.A. (\"CGS\") and Camuzzi Gas Pampeana S.A. (\"CGP\"), each of which, in its capacity as \"Licensee\" is a natural gas distribution company. Both CGS and CGP each holds a license granted by the Argentine Republic to both supply and distribute natural gas in seven provinces of that country.\n\n**Origins of the dispute**\n--------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe dispute originated in the suspension of the licensee companies\u2019 tariff increases based on the U.S. producer price index and the subsequent pesification of these tariffs pursuant to Law No. 25561. In addition, the Claimant asserts that subsidies granted have not been reimbursed and that certain taxes and levies that have been introduced by some Argentine provinces, as well as other measures relating to the payment for services, labor restrictions, and the transfer of tax costs, are prejudicial to it. All the foregoing, in the Claimant\u2019s opinion, results in a breach of the guarantees granted by the Argentine Republic pursuant to law and the licenses, and in a violation of the measures of protection to foreign investments provided for under the Treaty.\n\n***B. OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION***\n-----------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has filed objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the grounds that in this case there is no legal dispute, that the measures complained of are not directly related to an investment, that no national of another contracting State has been directly harmed, that the claim is premature, that the Claimant lacks *jus standi,* that the Claimant has not established that it qualifies as an investor, and that the dispute has been submitted to other tribunals.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts that the fact that Article I(a)(ii) of the BIT defines as investments \"a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof...\" is not sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of an ICSID Tribunal. Moreover, in its opinion, the requirements of Article 25(1) of the Convention have to be met regarding the existence of a legal dispute arising directly from the investment and involving a contracting State with the national of another contracting State. It further asserts that for a juridical person incorporated in a State to be considered a national of another contracting State, it must be subject to foreign control in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent has emphasized the fact that the Claimant\u2019s claim is connected with the License and not directly to the investment. If there were a violation, it is argued, it would affect only the licensees\u2014CGS and CGP\u2014but not Sodigas Sur or Sodigas Pampeana, which are only shareholders in the licensees. Nor would domestic companies owned or controlled by Sempra have been affected, which would moreover not meet the requirements of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant is of the view that all the requirements for establishing the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction are fully met: it is a legal dispute between a national of the United States and the Argentine Republic concerning losses that affect the interests it has in the licensee companies; the interests involved constitute an investment defined and protected by the BIT; and the harm and losses at issue amount to a violation of the BIT\u2019s guarantees.\n\n25.\n\nIn order to examine these arguments, the Tribunal first has to determine the law applicable to the decision on jurisdiction, a matter that the parties discussed at the hearing. In the Argentine Republic\u2019s argument, as the parties have not agreed on any applicable law, there is no option but to resort to the second part of Article 42(1) of the Convention, which calls for the application of domestic legislation and international law. In this context, the argument follows, no court of the Argentine Republic would accept a claim of this sort or allow piercing of the corporate veil.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimant is of the view that this provision applies solely to the decision concerning the merits of the dispute, and that for a determination on jurisdiction it is only necessary to apply the Convention and the Treaty.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the conclusion reached in *Azurix* to the effect that Article 42(1) applies to the merits of the dispute and that to reach a determination on jurisdiction only Article 25 of the Convention and the terms of the Treaty must be applied.3\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. the Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on jurisdiction of December 8, 2003, paras. 48-50, 43 *ILM* 262 (2004) (hereinafter *Azurix).*\n\n28.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal will examine now each of the objections presented and the opposing arguments, following for this purpose the same order in which they were presented by the Argentine Republic.\n\n**First Objection: Non- controlling shareholder**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nOpinion of the Parties\n----------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Argentine Republic puts forward as an objection to jurisdiction, first, that Sempra does not meet the nationality requirement established in Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention because, in its capacity as minority shareholder in the companies participating in CGS and CGP, it cannot substitute itself in the latter\u2019s rights. Accordingly, the Respondent affirms, the denationalization referred to in that article does not occur.\n\n30.\n\nReferring to the *Vacuum Salt* case,4 which interpreted and applied the provisions of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention as to the meaning of foreign control, the Respondent argues that what is meant is an \"exclusive\" control which enables at least blocking changes in the company, a circumstance which does not occur in this case. In the light of the background events and situations leading up to the Convention, it is also affirmed that that article must be understood as referring to foreign nationals that have a \"dominant interest\"5 and that, in response to proposals aimed at eliminating the control requirement, some delegations insisted that it be maintained.6 It is further noted that, in the opinion of one author, this concept presumes \"effective control or a dominant position and not merely participation.\"7\n\n*Vacuum Salt Products v. Republic of Ghana* (ICSID Case No. ARB/92/1), Award of February 16, 1994, 9 *ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ12* (1994) (hereinafter *Vacuum Salt).*\n\nDocuments Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, Vol. IV, 1969, p. 48, as cited in the *Memorial on Jurisdiction of the Argentine Republic,* Note 4 (hereinafter *Memorial on Jurisdiction).*\n\nDocuments Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, Vol. IV, 1969, p. 171, as cited in Memorial on Jurisdiction, Note 5.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 18, with reference to Schreuer, Christoph H., *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* Cambridge University Press (2001), p. 315.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimant asserts, to the contrary, that control is not a requirement for the protection of investments in the system of bilateral treaties on this matter, and refers in this connection to the *Lanco8 CMS9 Azurix10* and *Enron11* cases. Neither, it is argued, does the Convention define the concept of foreign control and the *Vacuum Salt* case did not exclude the fact that control could be exercised by minority shareholders if they did in fact wield a substantive influence in the company\u2019s decisions.\n\n*Lanco International, Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6), Preliminary decision on jurisdiction of December 8, 1998, *5 ICSID Rep.* 367 (hereinafter *Lanco).*\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on objections to jurisdiction of July 17, 2003, 42 *ILM1%&* (2003) (hereinafter *CMS).*\n\n*Azurix.*\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on jurisdiction of January 14, 2004, http://www.asil.org/ilib/Emon.pdf (hereinafter *Enron I).*\n\n32.\n\nApart from the question of whether minority or indirect shareholders are entitled to protection under the Treaty, a point that will be analyzed separately, the Claimant argues that in this case Sempra and Camuzzi, the Claimant in the concurrent arbitration proceedings, have both separate and joint control in Sodigas and in the licensees, CGS and CGP. In the specific case of Sempra, its holding of 43.09 % in Sodigas enables it to exercise a \"negative\" control over both Sodigas and the licensees because it can effectively block their decisions; Camuzzi, for its part, can exercise a \"positive\" control.\n\n33.\n\nIt is explained in this context that it was the *Vacuum Salt* case which considered the possibility of a shareholders\u2019 agreement or other modalities through which control could be exercised by means of positive or negative action over the company\u2019s future, concluding that the claimant in that case did not comply with any of these alternatives.\n\n34.\n\nIn the present case, it is also explained, the joint control of the two companies is expressed first in a Shareholders\u2019 Agreement between Sempra and Camuzzi and then in the By-Laws of Sodigas and the licensees. This also means that important resolutions of the Meeting of Shareholders cannot be adopted without the affirmative vote of Sempra and Camuzzi. It is accordingly argued that, in this context, Sempra has a veto power over many resolutions and a substantive influence in the managing of the company.\n\n35.\n\nThe Argentine Republic rejects the theory of joint control, maintaining that neither of the two investors can demonstrate that it controls Sodigas and the licensee companies in the legal sense of forming the companies\u2019 will through effective control or a dominant influence; neither of the investors can make decisions by itself, but must resort to a vote and not even the veto can be considered to imply effective formation of the company\u2019s will. It is also pointed out that this would be even less likely to occur in the case of indirect investors.\n\n36.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s opinion, the theory of joint control leads to the application of two bilateral treaties instead of one, combining the beneficiaries and the respective rules into a single whole, which is incompatible with the consent manifested individually in each treaty and with the personal and material application of each of them.\n\n37.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the requirement laid down in Article 25(2)(b) regarding the existence of an agreement concerning foreign control to enable national companies to act directly vis-\u00e0-vis ICSID is solely an additional option to the one furnished by the first sentence of the article. This option, moreover, is the one that is also authorized by Article VII(8) of the BIT, in terms of which the Argentine Republic accepted that United States investors with interests amounting to control of Argentine companies can resort to it. However, the argument follows, this option in no way affects the right of an investor of that nationality to submit the dispute to ICSID in his own name if, to this end, it meets the requirements of the Convention and of the BIT. The *CMS, Azurix,* and *Enron* cases are again cited in this context.\n\nConsiderations of the Tribunal\n------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe objection to jurisdiction concerning control of a national company raised by the Argentine Republic involves two aspects. The first relates to the scope of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention and whether it establishes an autonomous jurisdiction requirement or one option additional to others. The second aspect, which is definitely a novel approach, refers to the modalities of exercise of control over a company and the alternative of control through a shareholders\u2019 agreement.\n\n39.\n\nThe said article envisages two different situations. The first sentence understands that \"National of another Contracting State\" is \"any juridical person who...has the nationality of a contracting State different from the State that is a party in the dispute...\" The second sentence refers to an additional situation: \"...and the juridical persons who, having...the nationality of the State that is a party in the dispute,... and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for purposes of this Convention.\"\n\n40.\n\nThe structure of the provision leaves no room for doubt. The first situation is that of a company having the nationality of a contracting State different from the one that is a party to the dispute. To the extent that it meets the requirements of the Convention and of the respective Treaty, that company is eligible to resort to ICSID on the basis of its nationality.\n\n41.\n\nThe second situation is different. It relates to a company which has the nationality of the State that is a party to the dispute and which, for that reason, could be prevented from claiming against its own State; in such a case, the foreign control criterion enables it to complain as if it were a company of the nationality of the other contracting Party, insofar as this has been agreed between the States concerned. In addition to the substantive difference between these two situations, its supplementary nature, as the Claimant argues, is clearly marked by the word \"and\" with which the second sentence of the article begins.\n\n42.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimant in fact had an option. It could claim as a national of the United States, the other contracting State, insofar as it meets the requirements laid down in the Convention and the Treaty. Whether or not the definition of investment considers the case of a minority shareholder or an indirect investment is a separate issue that is the subject of another objection to jurisdiction. Sodigas also had the option to complain as a company incorporated in Argentina, if it is established that this company is under foreign control and, through it, the licensee companies too. This option was the subject of an agreement between the parties contained in Article VII(8) of the Treaty. The existence of this possibility does not prevent the investor claiming as such under the terms of the first sentence, if that option is also available.\n\n43.\n\nAt the hearing on jurisdiction held in this case, the Argentine Republic raised the question of why Sempra had not claimed as an Argentine company\u2014presumably Sodigas\u2014if in fact it considered that it had control of that company and thereby met the requirements of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention and of Article VII(8) of the Treaty. The Claimant explained that that option had in fact been considered but the alternative of claiming as a U.S. company was preferred as it would simplify the requirements for registration of the request for arbitration. By letter of February 10, 2005, the Argentine Republic asked the Secretary-General of ICSID to clarify this aspect in so far it concerns discussions allegedly held during the process of registration. After seeking the comments of the Claimant, which were submitted on February 16, 2005, ICSID informed the parties on February 23, 2005 that ICSID only provides general information to the parties and not advice as to the specific legal choices that may be available. The Tribunal finds in this respect that this is an aspect relating to the jurisdiction of the Centre that only the Tribunal can decide and is, consequently, entirely beyond the scope of the functions ICSID Secretary-General. This jurisdictional determination is what the Tribunal will do next.\n\n44.\n\nAt first sight, the Respondent notes, if an option such as the one discussed were to be permitted this would lead to a contradiction since a shareholder could always claim as such under the first sentence of the article, thus rendering the second sentence redundant. But in fact there is no such contradiction. It is conceivable that where various investor companies resort to arbitration, some can do so as shareholders and others as companies of the nationality of the State that is a party to the dispute, on the basis of the various corporate arrangements and control structures. Thus, for example, in the *Lucchetti* case,12 Empresas Lucchetti, S.A., petitioned as a foreign investor, while Lucchetti Per\u00fa, S.A., did so as a company incorporated in Peru and controlled by the same foreign investor, a situation also envisaged in the pertinent treaty.\n\nLucchetti S.A. and Lucchetti Peru, S.A. v. Republic of Peru (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4), Award of February 7, 2005, par. 15, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/lucchetti-award.pdf (hereinafter *Lucchetti)*\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal can then conclude that the option offered by the second sentence of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, as well as by Article VII(8) of the Treaty, provides an additional or different alternative which does not in this case prevent an investor from opting to act under the first sentence of the Convention article if it meets the pertinent requirements.\n\n46.\n\nIn the light of this conclusion, it would appear unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider the second question raised, regarding the manner in which control is exercised, i.e. separately or jointly, since that is not the alternative under which ICSID was accessed. However, it is important to address the concerns and arguments the parties have invoked in this respect.\n\n47.\n\nIt is first necessary to establish that, from the standpoint of corporate law, it is quite normal that various shareholders might control the policies and operations of a company through a shareholders\u2019 agreement, the terms of which are as mandatory as a contract. In this respect, the formation of the corporate will follows the rules of that agreement.\n\n48.\n\nThis was specifically the situation taken into account in *Vacuum Salt,* when the tribunal held:\n\n\"Nowhere in these proceedings is it suggested that Mr. Panagiotopulos, as holder of 20 percent of Vacuum Salt\u2019s shares, either through an alliance with other shareholders, through securing a significant power of decision or managerial influence, or otherwise, was in a position to steer through either positive or negative action, the fortunes of Vacuum Salt.\"13\n\n*Vacuum Salt,* para. 53, as cited in the Reply on Jurisdiction of the Argentine Republic, para. 14 (hereinafter *Reply on Jurisdiction).*\n\n49.\n\nThe possibility of control through an agreement of shareholders or other means is there envisaged, while at the same time the alternative of a form of both positive and negative control is indicated. The arguments invoked in this connection by the Claimant in this case concerning the existence of an agreement of shareholders and the consequent control of the company, positive for Camuzzi and negative through the exercise of the veto for Sempra, do not appear to contradict what is stated in *Vacuum Salt.*\n\n50.\n\nHowever, there is one aspect on which *Vacuum Salt* sheds no light whatsoever. In that case there was no bilateral treaty on protection of investments and the situation was governed entirely by the law of the host country to the investment. This therefore makes it necessary to examine the problem in the light of the existence of such a treaty, as is the case in the present dispute.\n\n51.\n\nThe pertinent question is whether a foreign investor can add to its own participation in a local company an additional percentage belonging to another foreign investor so that their combined weight will thereby achieve the necessary control. Of course, combination of the participation of a foreign investor with that of a local investor should be excluded, since in that case, although the combination could result in control, this would not be foreign control. There would not appear to be any problem if various foreign investors of the same nationality, acting under one and the same treaty, were to make their respective investments in the local company and then organize it by means of an agreement of shareholders.\n\n52.\n\nThe problem arises in the case of foreign investors of different nationalities acting, as in this case, under different treaties. The Argentine Republic is right when it argues that the consent is expressed in each treaty individually, with a different personal and normative import, in such a way that the combination of various participations could result in situations that that consent did not have in mind and might not have intended to include. In such an alternative the control could not be exercised jointly for the purposes of the Convention and of the Treaty and would have to be measured on the basis of the individual intents.\n\n53.\n\nThe assertion of the Claimant to the effect that the shareholders\u2019 nationality is not relevant inasmuch as they are nationals of a State that is a contracting party to the Convention is not convincing. It could, for instance, result in a shareholder protected by a treaty adding his participation to that of another shareholder who is a national of a State that is a party to the Convention but does not have a bilateral treaty with the host State that would protect him.\n\n54.\n\nHowever, if the context of the initial investment or other subsequent acquisitions results in certain foreign investors operating jointly, it is then presumable that their participation has been viewed as a whole, even though they are of different nationalities and are protected by different treaties. In such a case, it would be perfectly feasible for these participations to be combined for purposes of control or to make the whole the beneficiary.\n\n55.\n\nIn the present dispute there are three elements that come together to demonstrate that joint participation was actually the case. Sempra\u2019s participation began in 1996, being added to that that Camuzzi started in 1992; the companies through which the investments were channeled progressively increased their shareholdings in the licensees, both by purchases from other shareholders and from the Argentine government itself, which auctioned blocks of shares up to and including the year 2000; the agreement of shareholders and the companies\u2019 By-Laws reflect the understandings for the administration and management of the operating companies.\n\n56.\n\nAll of this was done jointly by Sempra and Camuzzi, in such a way that when the dispute arose it was already a reality that could not be ignored for jurisdictional purposes. An important evidence to this effect, invoked by the Claimant, is that the Office of the Secretary of Defense of Competition and of Consumers of the Ministry of Economy of the Argentine Republic approved the complex share transaction carried out in 2000 by Sempra and Camuzzi, noting that said transaction meant \"the assumption of control over the enterprises whose shares are being acquired.\"14 This was precisely a case of joint control.\n\nMinistry of Economy, Office of the Secretary for Defense of Competition and the Consumer, Resolution No. 196, September 20, 2000, and Annexed Opinion of the Commission on the Defense of Competition; Exhibit No.2 to the Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n57.\n\nAs already noted, with all the importance this discussion has, it becomes somewhat academic in the light of the fact that the access to ICSID was made on the basis of the first sentence of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention and not on the basis of the requirements concerning control envisaged in the second sentence.\n\n58.\n\nIt follows from the foregoing that the key question is to determine whether the Claimant meets the requirements for acceding to ICSID, an issue that has been discussed by the parties in the light of other objections to the jurisdiction that will be analyzed next.\n\n**Second Objection: Indirect Losses**\n-------------------------------------\n\nOpinion of the Parties\n----------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe second objection to jurisdiction presented by the Argentine Republic is that the Claimant could only validly claim if it could prove that a legal right that it possessed in its capacity as shareholder had been violated, causing it a direct loss. If it were a matter of a mere interest affected as a result of a measure that affects the company in which it is a shareholder, it is then the company that is entitled to claim and not the shareholder. This is the reason why the Convention requires, in this interpretation, that there be a legal dispute and that the measure challenged has a direct effect on the investment.\n\n60.\n\nIn support of this viewpoint the history of the negotiation of the Convention is invoked, in that the requirement of a legal dispute \"had the purpose of encompassing those cases involving differences of opinion with respect to a legal right\" and that the right in question had to arise directly and specifically from the investment.15 None of this occurs, in Respondent\u2019s opinion, in this case as no right of Sempra has been expropriated or treated unjustly and, if there had been such a violation, only the licensees could consider themselves the holders of the right entitling them to claim; Sempra\u2019s claim is based solely on the decrease of the company\u2019s value and how that impacts the proportional part owned by it as a shareholder.\n\nDocuments Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, Vol. IV, 1969, p. 84, 308, as cited in *Memorial on Jurisdiction,* Notes 15 and 20.\n\n61.\n\nThe Argentine Republic also cites the *Methanex* case16 in which there was discussion as to whether the measures disputed specifically targeted the claimant or whether it was rather a complaint about indirect or consequential losses. Moreover, it is further argued, besides rejecting the idea that claims can be made on account of something that merely affects interests, the tribunal pointed out that such alternative could precipitate an endless chain of complaints before arbitration tribunals.\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America,* Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Aug. 7, 2002, http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/12613.pdf\n\n62.\n\nIn this same context the argument also discusses the pleadings of the United States in the *GAMI* case,17 which held that a shareholder can only claim if his rights as such have been violated, and the support given to this viewpoint by customary international law, as expressed in the *Barcelona Traction* case.18 The decision on jurisdiction in *CMS* also recognized such an import, in the Respondent\u2019s opinion, in that it affirmed that a tribunal could not consider measures of a general nature but only those that violate specific obligations entered into with the investor.\n\n*GAMI Investments, Inc. v. United Maxican States,* Brief of the United States of America, June 30, 2003, http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/22212.pdf as cited in *Memorial on Jurisdiction,* Note 9 (hereinafter *GAMI).*\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Limited, Reports,* 1970, p. 4, para. 44, as cited in *Memorial on Jurisdiction,* Note 11.\n\n63.\n\nIn any event, the argument adds, the rights of the investor are defined and delimited by the national law of the host country or, where applicable, derivative claims must be expressly permitted, as is the case under certain conditions in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the Free Trade Agreement between Chile and the United States.19 Without such authorization, the shareholders would be able to acquire priority over any other creditor of the company.\n\nFree Trade Treaty between Chile and the United States, June 6.2003. http://www.direcon.cl/documentos/TLC%20EEUU/version%20completa%20TLCChile%20EEUU.pdf\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s view is radically different. It argues in fact that the dispute brought by Sempra is of a legal nature since it refers to a violation of the obligations contained in the Treaty and the corresponding compensation, noting that the existence of such obligations arises directly from the Treaty and is independent of the fact that the right of the licensees may also have been violated. This is the reason why, in this other opinion, the right protected is that of the investor arising directly from the investment made; neither is it a matter of general measures but of measures that specifically affect these rights.\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimant cites in support of its position the decisions on jurisdiction in the *CMS, Enron* and *Azurix* cases, which it asserts rejected similar arguments by the Argentine Republic in comparable or identical situations. It further argues that the decision in the *Methanex* case has been incorrectly interpreted by the Respondent since that decision required that there be a significant legal connection between the measure and the investment, which was not present in that case but is precisely the situation in the present dispute. Neither is there any evidence for believing there could be an endless chain of indirect claims, as in fact has not happened, nor could there be a double recovery for damages or the rights of creditors become subordinated to shareholders\u2019 claims.\n\n66.\n\nIn addition to the cases and situations discussed by the parties in their written presentations, they had the opportunity to undertake an extensive exchange of opinions at the hearing, including, at the Tribunal\u2019s request, their views on the similarities and differences of this dispute compared with other cases referred to. Some recent decisions on protection of investments were also discussed, as will be noted further below.\n\nConsiderations of the Tribunal\n------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe foregoing discussion involves two main aspects: the existence of a legal dispute and whether, if there is one, it arises directly from the Claimant\u2019s investment.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal has no difficulty in concluding that both elements are clearly present in this case. First, the record shows a marked difference between the parties concerning the nature and extent of their respective rights and expectations and their pretensions. This difference not only concerns the facts but mainly the law, as it is reflected in the Treaty. The actual claim submitted, as will be examined below, arises from the alleged violation of the rights and guarantees that the investor has in the light of the Treaty. The legal nature of this dispute is beyond any doubt.\n\n69.\n\nNext, the dispute arises directly from the investment that the Claimant has made in the companies incorporated in the Argentine Republic for the purpose of channeling the investment to the licensees. In this connection, if one were to conclude anything different, one would be depriving the Treaty of any effect since it was signed with the precise intention of guaranteeing the investments that would be made in the privatization process, by means of the specific modality with which they were made.\n\n70.\n\nAs will also be discussed below, this is the definition of investment that is included in the Treaty, a definition which the Tribunal cannot ignore since, as the tribunal noted in *Azurix,* it sought to facilitate agreement between the parties thereby preventing that the corporate personality of the company might interfere with the protection of the real interests associated with the investment.20\n\n*Azurix,* para. 64.\n\n71.\n\nWhether the measures in dispute can have a general effect, as the Argentine Republic affirms, or an effect that directly affects the investor, as Sempra argues, is an important distinction which flows in part from *CMS,* but which, in any case, is a determination that must be made in connection with the merits and not at the jurisdictional stage. The Tribunal shares the Respondent\u2019s opinion to the effect that setting the value of the currency is a sovereign right, citing in support of this view the decision in *Serbian Loans,21* but if this determination eventually affects a legally enforceable commitment it is not unrelated to the jurisdiction of an arbitration tribunal to which a dispute on the subject matter is brought. However, from there to argue, as the Respondent does, that hearing the dispute violates the principle of self-determination and a rule of *jus cogens,* as recognized in the *Western Sahara* case,22 there is a considerable distance.\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice, *Serbian Loans,* Series A. No. 20, 1929.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Advisory Opinion Concerning Western Sahara, Reports,* 1975, p. 12.\n\n72.\n\nNotwithstanding that some of the cases cited by the parties will be discussed when considering certain meanings of international law that have been disputed, it is necessary to clearly state the Tribunal\u2019s understanding in two recent cases which have been the subject of intense debate by the parties, both in their written presentations and at the hearing.\n\n73.\n\nThe first of these is the *Methanex case.* The Argentine Republic rightly argues that the views put forward by the parties in that case are very similar to those disputed here. The Claimant asserted that its rights had been affected by the measures taken, while the Respondent was of the view that measures that affected the company could not be actionable by the shareholders who had no more than a mere interest. However, it is also true that the tribunal sought to determine whether there was a significant connection between the measures and the investment.\n\n74.\n\nThat connection, it was concluded, was not there in the case of *Methanex* since the Claimant did not even produce the component that was regulated by the measures questioned. However, that connection does exist in the present case since the investment was made to carry out the specific economic activity involved in the privatization project, in addition to the fact that in doing so contracts leading to the issuance of a license were signed with the State.\n\n75.\n\nThe second case that the parties have discussed in this connection is *GAMI.* Here too, the parties disputed the right of action of a shareholder (GAMI) about a loss deriving from damage to the company in which it had invested (GAM). In this case the tribunal held:\n\n\"The fact that a host state does not explicitly interfere with share ownership is not decisive. The issue is rather whether a breach of NAFTA leads with sufficient directness to loss or damage in respect of a given investment.\n\nWhether GAM can establish such a prejudice is a matter to be examined on the merits. Uncertainty in this regard is not an obstacle to jurisdiction.\"23\n\n*Garni,* Final award of November 15, 2004, http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/38789.pdf para. 33.\n\n76.\n\nThis Tribunal shares that conclusion, particularly to the extent that the treaty on which the protection or guarantee claimed is based provides for the possibility of a shareholder to resort to arbitration concerning the investment made, which is precisely the case in the present dispute where direct or indirect ownership are considered and a broad definition of investment is adopted. The conclusion in the *Mondev* case,24 where problems of action for derivative damages are also discussed, is based on the same concept.25\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Final award of October 11, 202, 6 *ICSID Rep.* 192 (2004).\n\n*Enron Corporation y Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Jurisdiction (additional claim) of August 2, 2004, paras. 33-36 (hereinafter *Enron II).*\n\n77.\n\nThe argument made by the Argentine Republic and which is also reflected in *Methanex,* to the effect that if the right of shareholders to claim when only their interests are affected is recognized it could lead to an unlimited chain of claims, is theoretically correct. However, in practice any claim for derivative damages will be limited by the arbitration clause. As noted in connection with this argument by the tribunal in *Enron'.*\n\n\"...the answer lies in establishing the extent of the consent to arbitration of the host State. If consent has been given in respect of an investor and an investment, it can be reasonably concluded that the claims brought by such investor are admissible under the treaty. If the consent cannot be considered as extending to another investor or investment, these other claims should then be considered inadmissible as being only remotely connected with the affected company and the scope of the legal system protecting that investment.\"26\n\n*Enron I,* para. 52.\n\n78.\n\nMoreover, the fact must be noted that if the investor has rights protected under a treaty their violation will not result in merely affecting its interests but will affect a specific right of that protected investor.\n\n79.\n\nThe objection to jurisdiction made by the Argentine Republic on grounds of the indirect nature of the damage does not find support in the light of the facts of this case and of the applicable law. However, the objection concerning the *jus standi* of the Claimant must still be examined.\n\n**Third Objection: Lack of** ***jus standi***\n---------------------------------------------\n\nOpinion of the Parties\n----------------------\n\n80.\n\nIn close connection with the issues discussed above, the Argentine Republic raises an additional objection to jurisdiction based on the view that the Claimant lacks *jus standi* to claim in this case. The Respondent argues that although companies qualify as investments under the terms of the Treaty, such companies must be directly or indirectly owned or else be controlled by a national or a company having the nationality of the other State party to the dispute. In the opinion of the Argentine Republic, Sempra does not own or control any national company having links with the licensees.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimant argues that its claim was not made in respect of the rights the licensees might have but rather in its own name, a right provided for under the Treaty, in particular Article I(l)(a). It also argues that this is in any case a question to be discussed in connection with the merits and not at the jurisdictional stage; as such, it must be decided in the light of the Convention, the Treaty and international law.\n\n82.\n\nThis issue is also inextricably bound up with the question now often faced by international arbitration tribunals in terms of drawing a distinction between disputes arising from the violation of a treaty on investment protection and those that are of a purely contractual nature.\n\n83.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, Sempra cannot argue that it has a genuine claim of its own in the light of the Treaty entitling it to bring an action before ICSID since, if it has suffered harm this is purely of a contractual nature and should therefore be a matter of claim and action by the licensee companies.\n\n84.\n\nFor the Argentine Republic this is the import of the decision of the International Court of Justice in the *ELSI* case,27 where the Court concluded that compliance with national law is different from compliance with the provisions of a treaty. In the Argentine Republic\u2019s opinion, this is also the import of the decision of the Annulment Committee in *Vivendi,* where it was concluded that if the claim was of a contractual nature it would give effect to the choice-of-forum clause included in that contract.28\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Elettronica Sicula S. p. A. (ELSI), Reports,* 1989, p. 15.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee of July 3, 2002, 19 *ICSID Rev.\u2014 FILJ* 89 (2004), p\u00e1r. 98 (hereinafter *Aguas).*\n\n85.\n\nThe *SGS v. Pakistan* case29 was also based, the argument follows, on the distinction between contract and treaty claims, even when it was established that a contract-based claim could at the same time be one under the treaty; on the other hand, in the decision on annulment in *Vivendi* the two concepts were separated in establishing that the rules must be independent in one and the other case and originate in different facts.\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of August 6, 2003, 18 *ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ* 301 (2003) (hereinafter *SGS v. Pakistan).*\n\n86.\n\nIn the present case, according to the Argentine Republic\u2019s argument, the entire basis of the claim is its contract-related nature since the property affected has to be defined by the law of the State host to the investment, the alleged facts are not in any way connected with the Claimant and the remedy sought is the performance of the licensees\u2019 contract. Hence, in that opinion, there is no claim under the Treaty that the Tribunal could validly hear.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant, as already noted, argues that its claim is not based on rights that the licensees might have but on its own rights under the Treaty; the right to bring action under the Treaty is independent of the fact that there could also be elements of national law or parallel causes of action.\n\n88.\n\nIn the opinion of this other party, this would be the real meaning of the decision on annulment in *Vivendi* when the Committee holds that the violation of a treaty and a contract are different matters which must be determined by international law in the case of the former and by contract law in the latter.30 Successive decisions by ICSID tribunals have, it is asserted, also affirmed the right of shareholders to claim under the protection accorded them by the respective treaty, including *Maffezini31 Goetz32 AAPL33 Genin34 CMS, Azurix, Enron* and *GAMI,* among others.\n\n*Aguas,* para. 50.\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v.

Republic of Burundi* (ICSID Case No. ARB/95/3), Award of the Tribunal of February 10, 1999, *15 ICSID Rev.\u2014* FILJ 457 (2000) (hereinafter *Goetz).*\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Limited v.

Republic of Estonia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2), Award of the Tribunal of June 25, 2001, *II ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 395* (hereinafter Genin).\n\n89.\n\nIt is further argued that in the *Barcelona Traction* case the decision did not rule on the existence of shareholders\u2019 rights in international law and their protection, but on the situation arising from national law and in connection with the specific topic of diplomatic protection and the harm that the State of nationality of the shareholders might have suffered; rather, on the contrary, the decision expressly recognized the different situation that arose in international law with regard to protection of investments.\n\nConsiderations of the Tribunal\n------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe three objections to jurisdiction that have been discussed have in common the argument that the Tribunal could not hear the claims of investors who did not control the licensees and had not suffered any direct losses but only indirect and derivative effects, and that the right belongs to the licensees under a contract and not to their shareholders under international law. On the basis of these considerations the view is taken that the Claimant lacks *jus standi.*\n\n91.\n\nWithout prejudice to what has already been noted with regard to the first two objections, they must all be analyzed in the light of the specific provisions of the Treaty. The essential issues the Tribunal must decide are, first, whether the provisions of the Treaty do or do not allow for the claim of an investor who is not a majority shareholder and, second, whether the cause of action lies in the Treaty, the contract, or both.\n\n92.\n\nThe relevant provision is that of Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty:\n\n\"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes without limitation:\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;\n\n93.\n\nThere is no question that this is a broad definition, as its intent is to extend comprehensive protection to investors. Quite a few arbitration tribunals, acting under both the ICSID and the UNCITRAL rules, have recognized this import in the context of the same treaty and have concluded that, in the light of the very terms of the provision, it encompasses not only the majority shareholders but also the minority ones, whether they control the company or not. As the tribunal explained in the *Goetz* case, the authority to act granted to shareholders by the treaties on investments seeks protection for the real investors. In the *Enron* case the tribunal concluded that:\n\n\"The Tribunal must accordingly conclude that under the provisions of the Bilateral Investment Treaty, broad as they are, claims made by investors that are not in the majority or in the control of the affected corporation when claiming for violations of their rights under such treaty are admissible.\"35\n\n*Enron I,* para. 49.\n\n94.\n\nThe same conclusion has been shared by the tribunals in *CMS* and *Enron (Additional* *Claim),* among various others. This Tribunal has no reason not to concur with that conclusion, even though some of the elements of fact in each dispute may differ in some respects. If the purpose of the Treaty and the terms of its provisions have the scope the parties negotiated and accepted, they could not now, as has been noted, be ignored by the Tribunal since that would devoid the Treaty of all useful effect.\n\n95.\n\nThe second aspect the Tribunal must clarify is whether the Claimant\u2019s plea is founded on a contract, in a treaty, or both. Since the time this distinction was made in the *Lanco* case, the discussion of the matter has been significantly advanced. A claim can have a purely contractual origin and refer to a right that does not qualify as an investment, in which case there will be no jurisdiction, as was the case in *Joy36* but it can also originate solely in the violation of a provision of the treaty independently from domestic law or, as is more frequently the case, originate in a violation of a contractual obligation that at the same time amounts to a violation of the guarantees of the treaty. In these other cases there will be no obstacle to the exercise of jurisdiction.\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11), Decision on jurisdiction of August 6, 2004, http://www.asil.org/ilib/JoyMining Egypt.pdf\n\n96.\n\nThe latter is the criterion followed by several recent decisions on jurisdiction, particularly those on annulment in *Vivendi* and *Wena37* and the decision in *SGS v. Pakistan.* Another approach has been that of *SGS v. Philippines*,38 in which it was considered necessary first to have a contract-related aspect of the claim heard by a national court and to retain ultimate jurisdiction over those aspects connected with the treaty.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4) Decision of the Tribunal on Annulment of February 5, 2002, *6 ICSID Rep.* 129 (2004) (hereinafter *Wena).*\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA. v. Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of January 29, 2004, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/SGSvPhil-final.pdf (hereinafter *SGS v. Philippines)*\n\n97.\n\nThis issue was well described by the Annulment Committee in *Vivendi* when it concluded:\n\n\"The claim was not simply reducible to so many civil or administrative law claims concerning so many individual acts alleged to violate the Concession Contract or the administrative law of Argentina. It was open to Claimants to claim, and they did claim, that these acts taken together, or some of them, amounted to a breach of articles 3 and/or 5 of the BIT.\"39\n\n*Aguas,* para. 112.\n\n98.\n\nOn the basis of this criterion, the choice of a local forum for contractual purposes was also considered compatible with election of arbitration for purposes of the treaty,40 as will be discussed further below.\n\n*Wena.*\n\n99.\n\nNotwithstanding the differences of fact that distinguish these cases from others, the Tribunal sees no grounds to depart from this conceptual reasoning in that it arises from the very system of protection agreed to by the parties. The Tribunal must accordingly determine whether Sempra\u2019s claim belongs solely to the contract-related claim category, as the Argentine Republic asserts, or is based additionally or exclusively on the provisions of the Treaty, as the Claimant argues.\n\n100.\n\nWhile the specific nature of each claim can only be assessed by examining the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal notes at this stage that the dispute arises from how the violation of contractual commitments with the licensees, expressed in the license and other acts, impacts the rights the investor claims to have in the light of the provisions of the Treaty and the guarantees on the basis of which it made the protected investment.\n\n101.\n\nThe claim is accordingly founded on both the contract and the Treaty, independently of the fact that purely contractual questions having no effect on the provisions of the Treaty can be subject to legal action available under the domestic law of the Argentine Republic. Neither here does the Tribunal have any reason to depart from this approach. The fact that the Treaty also includes the specific guarantee of a general \"umbrella clause\", such as that of Article II(2)(c), involving the obligation to observe contractual commitments concerning the investment, creates an even closer link between the contract, the context of the investment and the Treaty.\n\n102.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has rightly expressed its concern about the fact that this approach could lead to double recovery for the same harm, one as a result of domestic contract-based action and the other as the outcome of an international arbitral award. The Respondent also draws attention to the fact that in the *GAMI* case, in the light of the NAFTA provisions all compensation must benefit the company and not the shareholder. This is a real problem that needs to be discussed in due course, but again it is an issue belonging to the merits of the dispute. In any event, international law and decisions offer numerous mechanisms for preventing the possibility of double recovery.\n\n**Fourth Objection: Renegotiation in progress**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOpinion of the Parties\n----------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Argentine Republic also objects to jurisdiction on the ground that the claim is not mature since the matter is still subject to a renegotiation process between the licensees and the Government. It is also claimed that what is at issue is a loss permanently fluctuating and therefore undetermined.\n\n104.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, if jurisdiction is affirmed it would result in an asymmetry and unequal treatment between the company and its foreign shareholders. In so far the latter would be able to claim for measures that affect the company, they ought also to accept that acts of the company benefiting the investors should be duly taken into account. Notwithstanding that the company is divested of rights in order to benefit foreign investors, the Respondent further argues, it is not accepted that these should have obligations concerning the conduct and actions of the domestic company.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the renegotiation process has not led to any solution whatsoever and is in fact paralyzed; it cannot therefore have any influence on the question of jurisdiction to resolve the dispute. It also argues that, in any event, this is an issue of admissibility which has to be decided on the merits of the dispute.\n\n106.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant argues that the losses are quantifiable and can be proved, but that is also something to be considered when examining the merits of the dispute.\n\nConsiderations of the Tribunal\n------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThis objection to jurisdiction raises four separate questions.\n\n108.\n\nThe first relates to the renegotiation process. As the tribunal held in *CMS,* it is not the task of an arbitral tribunal to take views on renegotiation proceedings which pertain exclusively to the parties.41 Whether or not this renegotiation is successful will be apparent from its specific outcomes, but the Tribunal should not defer proceedings on this count.\n\n*CMS,* para. 86.\n\n109.\n\nThe second question is the one relating to the meaning of admissibility. This aspect was also considered by the tribunal in *Enron* when holding that acceptance of an objection to admissibility would normally result in rejection of the claim on the merits.42 When this becomes evident in the jurisdiction phase it will be possible to resolve it at that point, but this is definitely not the case in the context of this dispute.\n\n*Enron I,* para. 33\n\n110.\n\nThe third question raised relates to the determination and quantification of the losses. This is also a question belonging to the merits of the claim and it is in that context that the eventual losses suffered will have to be identified and proved.\n\n111.\n\nThe fourth question refers to the asymmetry and unequal treatment the Argentine Republic asserts would occur. It is quite evident that in the context of a system of investment protection under international law, only the beneficiaries of such protection can resort to it. This was the intention of the Treaty and is also the situation in international law as it enables specific parties to take action in the light of its rules and mechanisms. Whether this protection can or should be extended to national investors is an alternative which only the evolution of international law and/or domestic law will be able to determine, but it is not what the parties to the Treaty intended.43\n\n*CMS,* para. 86.\n\n112.\n\nThe protected foreign investors clearly can claim on account of measures that affect the company to the extent that this is possible under the terms of the respective treaty, as is the case in this instance. This is entirely different from the intra-company relations to which the argument mentioned also appears to refer. To the extent that the acts of the company benefit the foreign investors, there is no reason why such benefits should not be taken into account at the appropriate time. Similarly, the investors will always have obligations vis-\u00e0-vis the company, and these will not change as a result of a claim under international law. Moreover, a shareholder may be even entitled to sue the directors or managers for acts of the company that cause him harm.\n\n113.\n\nIn the light of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that this objection is not pertinent.\n\n**Fifth Objection: Lack of evidence on the status of investor**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpinion of the Parties\n----------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Argentine Republic also objects to jurisdiction on the argument that Sempra has not established or proven its condition of investor with the pertinent corporate documents. The Claimant asserts it has provided all necessary documentation relating to the company structure confirming its status as an investor protected under the Treaty.\n\nConsiderations of the Tribunal\n------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined the documentation submitted and has no reason to believe that the Claimant does not qualify as an investor. Moreover, a most detailed examination of the company structure of Sempra, and also of that of Camuzzi, was made by the Argentine authorities themselves in the context of the protection of competition, as will be discussed further below. Accordingly, this objection cannot be retained.\n\n**Sixth Objection: The dispute has been submitted to national courts**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpinion of the Parties\n----------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Argentine Republic further objects to jurisdiction on the ground that the Claimant is prevented from taking action in this forum as a result of the forum selection clause of the license, which provides only for action before domestic courts; it is also argued that since the dispute has been submitted to the national courts of Argentina, the option under the principle *electa una via* (\"fork-in-the-road\") provided for in the Treaty has in fact been exercised.\n\n117.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s opinion, the choice of forum clauses in the licenses do not prevent disputes arising from treaty breaches being submitted for arbitration by ICSID, since the different forums have different scopes and objectives. Various decisions adopted by arbitral tribunals are cited in support of this opinion, in particular the decision of the tribunal in the *Lanco* case44 and those of the Annulment Committees in *Vivendi45* and *Wena46* among others.\n\n*Lanco,* paras. 39-40.\n\n*Aguas,* para. 101.\n\n*Wena,* para. 31.\n\n118.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that this dispute has not been submitted to the national courts and that the licensees have expressly refused to participate in proceedings regarding adjustment of tariffs and the actions of the Ombudsman. It is also argued that, in any case, no dispute about shareholders\u2019 rights under the Treaty has been submitted to said courts, nor has the Respondent identified any court in this context.\n\n119.\n\nIt is further asserted by the Claimant that decisions of ICSID tribunals have emphasized the difference between disputes of a commercial nature which do not involve provisions of the treaty, which can be submitted to the national courts in accordance with the respective contracts, and disputes which do impinge upon the guarantees provided under the treaty concerned, and which can be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the mechanisms laid down in that treaty.47\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, pp. 57-58, with special reference to *Genin and Azurix.*\n\nConsiderations of the Tribunal\n------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nDiscussion of the meaning of forum selection clauses in a contract is already a common feature of many disputes brought to arbitration. This is a direct consequence of the difference between a contract-based and a treaty-based claim, as noted.\n\n121.\n\nThe conclusion reached in this respect by the Annulment Committee in *Vivendi* is meaningful:\n\n\"[W]here \"the fundamental basis of a claim\" is a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state or one of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard.\"48\n\n*Aguas,* para. 101.\n\n122.\n\nThis Tribunal, like others that have considered this issue before, sees no reason to conclude otherwise. Moreover, by admitting the distinction between a contract-based and a treaty-based claim, the choice of forum is, as noted, a consequence of it that as such cannot affect the essence of the distinction.\n\n123.\n\nJust as a dispute that is purely contract-related will have to be brought before the forum envisaged in the contract, so too a dispute relating to the interpretation of a treaty can be submitted to the mechanisms of that treaty. If the contrary were true, the contract would nullify the provisions of the treaty. The Government of Chile, for example, refrained from putting forward objections to jurisdiction in the *MTD* case despite the fact that the contract specified the choice of a local forum, as it rightly understood that to the extent there was an alleged violation of the pertinent treaty that clause would not affect arbitral jurisdiction.49\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile SA. v. Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Award of May 25, 2004, http://www.asil.org/ilib/MTDvChile.pdf, para. 90.\n\n124.\n\nThe parties have discussed in this case other recent arbitral decisions which have considered the distinction between a dispute originating in a contract and one arising from a treaty, and its connection with the choice of forum, in particular *SGS* v. *Pakistan, SGS* v. *Philippines* and *Generation Ukraine50* Notwithstanding the different meaning that each party attributes to those decisions, the Tribunal notes that none contradicts the basic principle that a dispute can originate in a contract and simultaneously have an effect on a treaty, or the principle that a contract-related dispute can be submitted to the local forum and one under the treaty to the arbitral tribunal.\n\n*Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9), Award of September 16, 2003, http://www.asil.org/ilm/Ukraine.pdf (hereinafter *Generation Ukraine).*\n\n125.\n\nIn point of fact, in *SGS v. Pakistan* the dispute involved proceedings in various national courts and the arbitral forum specified in the treaty, with the tribunal concluding that it had jurisdiction over those contract-related aspects of the dispute that at the same time involved a violation of the treaty, but not over those that had no connection with the standards of protection set by the treaty in question.51 Similarly, in *Generation Ukraine* the tribunal confirmed its competence to consider the claims that related to the treaty and noted that technical aspects of the dispute should be submitted to the national courts as provided in the contract; the latter could be eventually transformed into a treaty claim in case of denial of justice.52\n\n*SGS v. Pakistan,* para. 162.\n\n*Generation Ukraine,* para.20.33.\n\n126.\n\nEven *SGS v Philippines,* which has prompted so much discussion, does not depart from the essential principle that those aspects of the dispute originating in the treaty can be submitted to the arbitral forum, even though the tribunal required that a contract-related component of that dispute concerning the precise amount of the amount due under the contract had to be resolved first by the domestic court.53\n\n*SGS v. Philippines,* para. 128.\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that in the present case submission of the dispute to a national court has not been established and, as far as a dispute under the Treaty is concerned, it has solely been submitted to this Tribunal. The principle *electa una via* does not show that an option in favor of local jurisdiction has been made; rather to the contrary, it shows opting for arbitral jurisdiction.\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that this objection cannot be retained.\n\n**The meaning and extent of international law**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nOpinion of the Parties\n----------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe parties have also discussed in the context of this dispute the meaning and extent of international law and the role of arbitral tribunals in the interpretation of treaties. This question was first raised in the Reply of the Argentine Republic and addressed by the Claimant in its Rejoinder. It was also discussed in the hearing.\n\n130.\n\nThe Argentine Republic argues in this connection that the consent given in ratifying the Convention does not mean that Argentina has consented to submitting a dispute to ICSID, for which an express commitment in writing is required. It is argued that while the investors are the addressees and beneficiaries of the system, the Treaty has been signed between States and must be interpreted in the light of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n131.\n\nResorting to general criteria of legal interpretation and the rules of the Vienna Convention, the Respondent believes that such interpretation must be based on the intention of the parties and that States signatories to the treaty are the best qualified to do so. In that view, interpretation is not the task of arbitral tribunals and the case law to this effect should be ignored. That function of States is connected to the principle that unilateral State acts can create legal obligations.54\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Nuclear Tests Case, Reports,* 1974, p. 253.\n\n132.\n\nRelying on those concepts, the Respondent believes that the relevant interpretation of the Treaty or equivalent provisions is that given by the representatives of the United States in the *GAMI, Methanex* and *Mondev* cases. Respondent also argues that intention cannot be established by means of the opinion of writers or other unofficial acts.\n\n133.\n\nThe Respondent is particularly critical of the decision in *Enron,55* considering that an alleged invitation to participate in the investment was confused with the required consent, as it was understood that the invitation had been made by the Argentine Government and because the bidding was national and not international. In the case of Sempra, it is further argued, this invitation could not have taken place as it was not issued either in the case of Camuzzi\n\nReply on Jurisdiction of Argentina, p. 48, with reference to *Enron I.*\n\n134.\n\nNothing in this argument, it is also asserted, is related to a question of diplomatic protection, also discussed in *Enron* when holding that, if the system is guided by the declarations of a State, reversion to the stage of diplomatic protection would inevitably follow. The Argentine Republic explains the differences between diplomatic protection and the system of investment protection, pointing out that even though, in the latter case, States may make different rules as to how a dispute arises and is dealt with, this does not mean that they have moved away from the standards of protection and rules of procedure.\n\n135.\n\nBoth *Enron* and *CMS* are also criticized for having apparently considered that the large number of investment-protection treaties and the **lex specialis** contained in them have become the general rule in connection with international claims.56 In the Respondent\u2019s opinion, a kind of induction process which raises the **lex specialis** to the level of customary international law cannot be justified.\n\n*CMS,* para. 48.\n\n136.\n\nThe relevant interpretation, the argument follows, is that which arises from the intention of the State expressed in the provisions of some treaties and omitted from the provisions of other treaties signed by the same State; this comparative exercise makes it possible to establish the value of silence vis-\u00e0-vis that of words, arguing that if a treaty includes a certain provision but a subsequent or simultaneous treaty does not, this constitutes a presumption that the recognition of the rights concerned is not intended\n\n137.\n\nThe Claimant is of the view that the interpretation of treaties cannot disregard the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose, as provided in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention and customary law. The intention of the parties, it is asserted, is not a principal or supplementary means of interpretation, even less so when one is attempting to apply the interpretation the United States has given to a provision of NAFTA to a separate treaty on investment protection.\n\n138.\n\nThe intention expressed by the negotiators of the program of bilateral treaties, which the Claimant cites in detail, would appear to indicate that the United States does not share the intention attributed to it by the Argentine Republic in this matter. Moreover, it is argued that the United States\u2019 interpretation in these NAFTA cases has been systematically rejected by the respective tribunals. Neither, it is also argued, does United States law play any role in the matter.\n\nConsiderations of the Tribunal\n------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Argentine Republic that the consent expressed in ratifying the Convention is not the consent required by the Convention for bringing a claim before ICSID; this indeed requires a separate declaration by means of a treaty or other acts making such consent unequivocally clear.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, cannot disregard the fact that the Argentine Republic signed the Treaty with the United States. This instrument embodies the expression of consent for resorting to arbitration should a dispute arise between the investor and the State with respect to the guarantees ensured under the Treaty. If what the Respondent is arguing is that an ad-hoc agreement between the investor and the State is needed to submit a specific dispute to arbitration, then this is a mistaken understanding. The Treaty is self-sufficient for this purpose and the option of resorting to dispute resolution is exercised by the investor by the simple fact of expressing its own consent. The concept of an arbitration clause (\"compromis\") additional to the agreement on arbitration, which was in favor at some point in private arbitration, is not envisaged in the Treaty and is no longer of great use.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with the Respondent that the rules for a correct interpretation are those of the Vienna Convention, which are also those that were followed in customary international law.57 The relevant provision is that of Article 31 of the Convention, providing that \"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"58\n\nMcNair: *The Law of Treaties,* 1961, 364-382.\n\nErnesto de la Guardia: *Derecho de los Tratados Internacionales,* 1997, 216-230.\n\n142.\n\nThis being the principal means of interpretation, it is the one that must be applied by the Tribunal. It has already been noted that the terms of the Treaty opted for the alternatives discussed, making it unnecessary to resort to supplementary means. But even if that were necessary, the negotiating history of the Treaty does not show that the intention asserted today by the Argentine Republic was that this country and the United States had in signing the Treaty. Rather to the contrary, the clear intention was to provide full protection for investors. A sizeable number of treaties were concluded by the Argentine Republic with the specific intent of encouraging the interest of foreign investors in the privatization program. To this end is that the terms of the Treaty discussed above were included.\n\n143.\n\nArticle 31 also makes it possible, if necessary, to take into account subsequent agreements or practices followed by the parties to a treaty with respect to its interpretation or application. The parties to NAFTA are certainly not the same as those to the Treaty. This would make it difficult to extend the interpretation that one party makes of a treaty to that which another party makes of a different treaty.\n\n144.\n\nNevertheless, as the tribunal held in *Enron59* it could be possible that the interpretation of a bilateral treaty between two parties in connection with the text of another treaty between different parties might be the same, unless a different intention is expressed. This was the approach followed by the tribunal in *Maffezini,* where for the correct interpretation of the treaty between the Argentine Republic and Spain the tribunal took into account the policy that the latter country had followed in concluding numerous bilateral treaties to protect Spanish investors abroad and the terms of those treaties.\n\n*Enron I,* para. 47.\n\n145.\n\nWhat the United States has affirmed in the discussion of the NAFTA cases noted has a relative value, as in any event that interpretation would have to find some support in the context of the Treaty or its background. However, as also noted, that background in this case points in a different direction, not allowing to identify the approach to interpretation of one ambit with that of the other. The fact that the competent tribunals have also rejected that interpretation is not irrelevant. Neither is the opinion of those who were responsible for the drafting and negotiation of a State\u2019s bilateral treaties irrelevant, in that it serves, precisely, to establish the original intention.\n\n146.\n\nThe fact that international law recognizes unilateral acts as a source of obligations is separate from the discussion in the matter of this dispute, since the essential requirement for that to happen is that there be the intention to create an obligation. The Tribunal cannot presume that intention if it is not expressly stated. Counsel representing the State in arbitration proceedings have the duty to put forward all the arguments they deem appropriate to defend their position, but a tribunal could not presume that each of those arguments constitutes the expression of a unilateral act that obligates the State. This intention was expressly stated, for example, in the case of the *Filetage a l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du Golfe de Saint-Laurent* and was recognized as such by the tribunal.60\n\nDiff\u00e9rend Concernant le Filetage \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du Golfe de Saint-Laurent (Canada-France), Award of July 17, 1986, Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Droit International Public, 1986/3, 713-786, p. 756.\n\n147.\n\nNotwithstanding the Argentine Republic\u2019s opinion to the contrary, interpretation is not the exclusive task of States. It is also the duty of tribunals called upon to settle a dispute, particularly when the question is to interpret the meaning of the terms used in a treaty. This is precisely the role of judicial decisions as a source of international law in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, to which the Respondent refers.\n\n148.\n\nIt is not the task of this Tribunal to consider the criticism of decisions of other tribunals, which may or not be justified, but it is necessary to discuss some aspects of that criticism which have a bearing on this case.\n\n149.\n\nThe first of these aspects is whether Sempra was or was not invited to participate in the privatization process. While the information provided indicates that Sempra did not make its investment until 1996, the fact of the matter is that the Treaty was in effect for all who wished to participate in the process, without any time limit. Moreover, officials of the Argentine Republic were not unaware of this investment.\n\n150.\n\nThe second aspect is the one connected with diplomatic protection. The Tribunal agrees with the Argentine Republic that diplomatic protection involves concepts and mechanisms that are very different from those available in the system of international investment protection. The latter has devised a mechanism that is separate from the role of the State of the investor\u2019s nationality, but not from that of the State host to the investment, which will have to participate in cases where a dispute arises with the investor.\n\n151.\n\nFor the same reason that diplomatic protection is inappropriate under the bilateral treaty system, neither can this system rely on approaches arising from that traditional mechanism, in particular those of the *Barcelona Traction* case. As the tribunal points out in *GAMT.*\n\n\"The Tribunal however does not accept that *Barcelona Traction* established a rule that must be extended beyond the issue of the right of espousal by diplomatic protection. The ICJ itself accepted in *ELSI* that US shareholders of an Italian corporate entity could seise the international jurisdiction when seeking to hold Italy liable for alleged violation of a treaty by way of measures *imposed on that entity\"61*\n\nGarni, para. 30, emphases in original, notes omitted.\n\n152.\n\nThis is the reason why today it could not be asserted in the light of the evolution of international law, that shareholders that qualify as protected investors within the scope of the system for protecting foreign investors are prevented from claiming their rights, even when the harm has been inflicted on the company in which they participate. The International Court of Justice itself did not fail to consider this point in *Barcelona Traction* in the light of what was then the emerging system for protecting investors under the Convention.\n\n153.\n\nAs the tribunal in *LG&E* also noted, whatever may have been the merits of *Barcelona Traction,* that case was concerned solely with the diplomatic protection of nationals by their State, while the case here disputed concerns the contemporary concept of direct access for investors to dispute resolution by means of arbitration between investors and the State.62\n\nLG&E Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, y LG&E International Inc. v. Rep\u00fablica Argentina (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), para. 52 (hereinafter LG&E).\n\n154.\n\nThe fact that, as the Respondent notes, in *ELSI* the shareholders held 100 percent of the shares and total control of the company, in addition to the fact that a bankruptcy situation was involved, neither of which apply in this case, does not change the principle at issue which is that shareholders can claim on their own. If, moreover, the treaties provide similar rights to shareholders having indirect ownership or control, or who are not majority shareholders, this does not alter that principle either. This was also the criterion applied by the tribunal in *LG&E63*\n\nLG&E, para. 50.\n\n155.\n\nAs noted, the parties have also discussed the importance of *Vacuum Salt* in this context because the investor in that case did not have control of the company and could not therefore claim under the Convention. However, as the tribunal in *Enron* noted, in *Vacuum Salt* there were two situations entirely different from those of *Enron* and this case: the company was entirely subject to Ghanaian legislation, without there being even a foreign-investment contract, and, even more important, there was no bilateral treaty to protect the investment.64 The latter is precisely what makes the difference in this case.\n\nEnron II, paras. 43-45.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal must, finally, refer to the question raised to the effect that *lex specialis* cannot be considered as leading to a rule of customary law. First, the Tribunal must note that there is no obstacle in international law to the expression of the will of States through treaties being at the same time an expression of practice and of the *opinion juris* necessary for the birth of a customary rule if the conditions for it are met.65\n\nJulio A. Barberis: \"R\u00e9flexions sur la coutume internationale,\" Annuaire Fran\u00e7ais de Droit International, Vol. XXXVI, 1990, 9-46.\n\n157.\n\nIn *CMS,* the tribunal held that the system of treaties on protection gives rise to a *lex specialis* which \"....can now be considered the general rule, certainly in respect of foreign investments and international claims...,\"66 However, this does not necessarily mean that it refers to the emergence of a customary rule. The general rule is evidenced by the fact that practically all disputes relating to foreign investments are today submitted to arbitration by resorting to the mechanisms of that *lex specialis,* as expressed by means of bilateral or multilateral treaties or other agreements. Only in very exceptional instances do the affected parties resort to diplomatic protection; the latter cannot then be considered the general rule in the system of international law presently governing the matter, but as a residual mechanism available when the affected individual has no direct channel to claim on its own right.\n\nCMS, para. 48.\n\n***C. DECISION***\n-----------------\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal hereby decides that this dispute falls within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal. The Tribunal has accordingly issued the Order necessary for continuation of the proceedings, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(4).\n\nIt is so decided."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2007-09-28T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Partial Dissenting Opinion of Mr. Marc Lalonde (Award)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2007-09-18T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Partial Dissenting Opinion of Mr. Marc Lalonde (Award)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have signed the Final Award in this case with my two colleagues. As noted in the section of the Award on interest, the decision to award interest only up to the date of the Final Award was adopted by a majority only.\n\nI respectfully disagree with my distinguished colleagues on this issue, as I believe that interest should run until full payment of the compensation awarded.\n\nIt is true that in its Consolidated Memorial, the Claimant states (at paragraph 526) that \" *Pre-award interest in this case should be compounded quarterly through the date of the award\".* Similar statements are found at paragraph 723 of the Reply (\" *All damages amount will need to brought forward to US dollars as of the date of the award\")* and paragraph 103 of the Post-Hearing Brief as well as in the Closing Statement of the Claimant. The Claimant suggests, in that case, that a compounded interest rate of 8% would be appropriate (Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 103).\n\nIt is essential to note that this request is made in the context of a request in the body of the various submissions for an actualization of the damages to the date of the award. The Tribunal has refused to proceed to such an actualization and has preferred to establish the total damages as at December 31, 2001.\n\nIt is equally essential to note that nowhere in the ***petitum*** of any of the Claimant's submissions do we find any limitation of time as to the running of interest or any suggested rate. Thus, the ***petitum*** at paragraph 537.7 of the Memorial reads: *\"An order that the Argentine Republic compensate Camuzzi and Sempra for all damages they have suffered, plus interest compounded quarterly\"* and, at paragraph 732.2 of the Reply, one reads: \" *An order that the Argentine Republic compensate Claimants for all damages they have suffered, plus interest compounded quarterly.\"* Again, the ***petitum*** itself makes no reference to a time limit or to a particular rate; these matters are clearly left to the discretion of the Tribunal.\n\nI cannot agree that one can take an argument made in the body of briefs for a particular purpose (the actualization of damages) and transpose that argument into the *petitum* which makes a very different request (with no time limitation, nor any specific rate of interest).\n\nActing on the *petitum*, I would have granted the Claimant interest at the rate mentioned in the Decision and Award, beginning January 1, 2002 and running until full payment of the compensation awarded, interest being compounded semi-annually. Acting otherwise, in my humble view, is ignoring the basic characteristic of interest which is the recognition of the time value of money and of the lost opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return. In addition, it is giving a strong incentive to the party at fault to delay indefinitely and with impunity the payment of the sums due. The arbitral system should not encourage that kind of behavior."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\nTHE TRIBUNAL\n\nComposed as above,\n\nAfter deliberation,\n\nMakes the following Award:\n\n**A.

In rendering its Award, the Tribunal has taken into account all pleadings, documents and testimony in this case insofar as it considered them relevant.\n\n**B. Summary of the Procedure**\n-------------------------------\n\n*1. Procedure Leading to the Decision on Jurisdiction*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn September 11, 2002, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) received from Sempra a Request for Arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the Convention) against Argentina. The Request concerned Sempra\u2019s investment in two natural gas distribution companies, together serving seven Argentine provinces, and a number of measures adopted by the Argentine Republic which, in the Claimant\u2019s view, modified the general regulatory framework established for foreign investors under which Sempra made its investment.\n\n5.\n\nSempra invoked in its request the provisions of the 1991 bilateral investment treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic (hereinafter the \"Argentina-U.S. bilateral investment treaty\" or \"the BIT\").1\n\nTreaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments, signed on November 14, 1991, which entered into force on October 20, 1994.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 12, 2002, in accordance with Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request and, on September 13, 2002, sent copies thereof to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of October 25, 2002, the Centre asked Sempra to provide additional information in connection with references made in the Request to claims being disputed before fiscal agencies and the Argentine Federal Supreme Court. Sempra responded by letters dated October 28 and November 5, 2002.\n\n8.\n\nOn December 6, 2002, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On the same date, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n9.\n\nOn March 4, 2003, the parties agreed to constitute a single tribunal to hear Sempra\u2019s claims together with another request for arbitration submitted by Camuzzi International S.A. (\"Camuzzi\"),2 also a shareholder in the gas distribution companies in which Sempra had invested. The proceeding instituted by Camuzzi has been suspended by agreement of the parties thereto, communicated to the Centre on June 7, 2007 and approved by the Tribunal on June 21, 2007. The parties also agreed that this tribunal would comprise one arbitrator appointed jointly by Sempra and Camuzzi, one arbitrator appointed by the Argentine Republic, and a third arbitrator, who would serve as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal, who would be appointed by the Secretary-General of ICSID.\n\nCamuzzi\u2019s Request for Arbitration was registered by the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID on February 27, 2003 as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/2.\n\n10.\n\nOn March 10, 2003, Sempra appointed The Honorable Marc Lalonde P.C., O.C., Q.C, a Canadian national, as an arbitrator. By letter dated April 3, 2003, Argentina appointed Dr. Sandra Morelli Rico, a Colombian national as an arbitrator. After consultation with the parties, Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuna, a national of Chile, was appointed as President of the Arbitral Tribunal by the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID.\n\n11.\n\nOn May 5, 2002, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that therefore the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to begun on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal with the parties was held on July 3, 2003, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. At the session the parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect.\n\n13.\n\nDuring the first session, the parties agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. Also during the first session, the Tribunal, after ascertaining the views of the parties on the matter, fixed the following time limits for the written phase of the proceedings: Claimant would file a memorial within ninety (90) days from the date of the first session; Respondent would file a counter-memorial within ninety (90) days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s memorial; Claimant would file a reply within forty-five (45) days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial; and Respondent would file a rejoinder within forty-five (45) days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s reply.\n\n14.\n\nDuring the first session, the Tribunal noted that, in accordance with the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Respondent had the right to raise any objections to jurisdiction it may have no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of its counter-memorial. For the case that Argentina were to raise objections to jurisdiction, a further schedule was agreed upon: Claimant would file a countermemorial on jurisdiction within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s memorial on jurisdiction; Respondent would file a reply on jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s counter-memorial; and finally, Claimant would file a rejoinder on jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s reply.\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed time limits, the Claimant submitted to the Centre a memorial on the merits, with accompanying documentation, on September 3, 2003. As agreed, the memorial comprised both the claims of Sempra and Camuzzi.\n\n16.\n\nOn December 31, 2003, the Respondent filed a memorial with objections to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the competence of the Tribunal. By letter of January 14, 2004, the Tribunal confirmed the suspension of the proceedings on the merits in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(3).\n\n17.\n\nRespondent received a copy of the Claimant\u2019s counter-memorial on jurisdiction and accompanying documentation on March 18, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the Claimant received a copy of the Respondent\u2019s reply on jurisdiction, with accompanying documentation. On June 3, 2004, the Respondent received a copy of the Claimant\u2019s rejoinder on jurisdiction, with accompanying documentation. All these pleadings were made jointly with the concurrent case in respect of Camuzzi.\n\n18.\n\nOn July 1, 2004, Mr. Francisco Ceballos, ICSID, replaced Mr. Gonzalo Flores as Secretary of the Tribunal. Mr. Ceballos having left ICSID in March 2005, Mr. Flores was reappointed as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal, having reviewed the parties\u2019 pleadings on jurisdiction, considered necessary holding a hearing, which, with the agreement of the parties, took place in Paris on November 29 and 30, 2004. The Claimant was represented at the hearing by Messrs. R. Doak Bishop and Craig S. Miles (King & Spalding LLP, Houston). Mr. Santiago F. Albarracin was also present on behalf of Sempra. The Argentine Republic was represented by Ms. Cintia Yaryura, Ms. Gisela Makowski and Mr. Gabriel Bottini, from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina. The hearing encompassed the parallel cases of Sempra and Camuzzi.\n\n20.\n\nDuring the hearing, Messrs. Bishop and Miles addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant. Ms. Yaryura, Ms. Makowski and Mr. Bottini addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Respondent. The Tribunal posed questions to the representatives of the parties, in accordance with Rule 32(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n21.\n\nOn May 11, 2005, the Tribunal, after due deliberation, issued its unanimous Decision on the Objections to Jurisdiction raised by the Argentine Republic. In its Decision, which forms part of this Award, the Tribunal rejected all of the Respondent\u2019s objections, concluding that the dispute fell within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal, in accordance with the ICSID Convention.\n\n22.\n\nCertified copies of the Tribunal\u2019s decision were distributed to the parties by the Secretary of the Tribunal. A copy of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction is attached to the present Award as an integral part of such.\n\n2. *Procedure Leading to the Award on the Merits*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nOn May 11, 2005, the Tribunal, following its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, issued, in accordance with Rules 19 and 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules of the Centre, Procedural Order No. 1 on the continuation of the proceeding on the merits. In that Procedural Order the Tribunal referred to the time table fixed during the July 3, 2003 first session of the Tribunal with the parties, directing the parties to file their remaining written pleadings on the merits of the dispute, as follows: Respondent to file a counter-memorial on the merits within forty-five (45) days from the date of the Order; Claimant to file a reply on the merits within forty-five (45) days from its receipt of Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial; Respondent to file a rejoinder on the merits within forty-five (45) days from its receipt of Claimant\u2019s reply.\n\n24.\n\nThe Order further contemplated that the Tribunal would shortly propose a date for a hearing on the merits.\n\n25.\n\nOn May 12, 2005, the Argentine Republic requested an extension for the filing of its counter-memorial on the merits of at least 60 days. By letter dated May 18, 2005, Claimant opposed to this request. The Tribunal, after careful consideration of the parties\u2019 positions in this regard, by letter from the Secretary of the Tribunal dated June 2, 2005, granted Argentina a 45-day extension for the filing of its counter-memorial on the merits. By same letter, the Tribunal informed the Claimant that if it wished to avail of a similar extension for the filing of its reply on the merits, the Tribunal would be prepared to consider such request.\n\n26.\n\nOn August 1, 2005, the Respondent filed its counter-memorial on the merits.\n\n27.\n\nOn August 2, 2005, the Tribunal, having consulted with the parties, fixed a date for the hearing on the merits.\n\n28.\n\nOn September 28, 2005, the Claimant filed its reply on the merits.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter dated October 24, 2005, the Argentine Republic requested the production of certain documents by the Claimant and requested that the time limit for the filing of its rejoinder on the merits begin to run upon receipt of said documents.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated October 28, 2005, the Claimant submitted observations to Argentina\u2019s request for production of documents.\n\n31.\n\nBy letter from the Secretary of the Tribunal dated November 2, 2005, the Tribunal informed the parties of its decision on (a) Argentina\u2019s request for production of documents; and (b) Argentina\u2019s request for a recalculation of the time limit for the filing of its rejoinder on the merits. In its decision, the Tribunal also addressed a request by the Argentine Republic, included in its counter-memorial on the merits, to exclude the testimony of three witnesses enclosed with Claimant\u2019 memorial and reply on the merits. This decision provides as pertinent:\n\n\"The Tribunal has carefully considered the Argentine Republic\u2019s requests and the Claimants\u2019 objections thereof. After due deliberation, the Tribunal has decided as follows:\n\n[...]\n\n(5) In regard to Argentina\u2019s request for the exclusion of the testimonies of Messrs. Perkins, Mairal and Peacock, the Tribunal, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 34, decides to admit the witnesses\u2019 statements filed by the Claimants. The Argentine Republic will have the opportunity to cross-examine these witnesses during the hearing on the merits. The Tribunal will inform the parties shortly on the manner in which cross examination will be conducted. This decision does not prejudge the question of the probative value of such testimonies, which will be determined by the Tribunal in due time.\"\n\n32.\n\nBy letter dated November 10, 2005, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed the parties\u2019 agreement to hold the hearing on the merits in this case in Santiago de Chile.\n\n33.\n\nOn December 5, 2005, the Argentine Republic filed its rejoinder on the merits.\n\n34.\n\nOn December 22, 2005, the Claimant filed a request for provisional measures regarding the oral testimony of two of its witnesses.\n\n35.\n\nOn December 29, 2005, the Argentine Republic filed, upon the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, observations to the Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures.\n\n36.\n\nOn January 16, 2006, the Claimant raised a number of challenges to the document entitled \"Evaluaci\u00f3n empresas Camuzzi Gas Pampeana S.A. y Camuzzi Gas del Sur S.A.\" submitted by Argentina on December 13, 2005, and requested further documentation from the Respondent.\n\n37.\n\nOn January 16, 2006, the Tribunal, through letter from the Secretary, informed the parties of its decision on the Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures of December 22, 2005, as follows:\n\n1. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the Claimants\u2019 request of December 22, 2005, including the attached documentation (i.e. injunction rendered on November 24, 2005 by the Federal District Court in Civil and Commercial Matters No. 8 of the Argentine Republic, regarding the provision of witness statements by Mr. Patricio Carlos Perkins in this and other ICSID proceedings).\n\n2. The Tribunal has taken note that the above referred injunction specifically states that Mr. Perkins should:\n\n\u2018refrain from making written statements or giving testimony at hearings in cases filed against the Argentine Republic before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), or regarding any other dispute which, directly or indirectly, results in the disclosure of data, information, investigation, conclusion, recommendation or report included within the scope of the confidentiality obligation set forth in clause 11.2 of the Consulting Agreement entered into between YPF, acting on behalf of the *Subsecretar\u00eda de Combustibles* and the firm \"Patricio C. Perkins y Asociados S.A. and/or related to his position as Executive Director regarding the privatization of Gas del Estado.\u2019(Translation into English provided by counsel for the Claimants on December 29, 2005).\n\n3. The Tribunal has also carefully reviewed the Argentine Republic\u2019s observations on this matter of December 29, 2005. The Tribunal notes that Argentina has stated for the record:\n\na. That Mr. Perkins was duly notified of the injunction, that he accepted such notice and that he did not raise any objection at the time of the notice;\n\nb. That the injunction seeks compliance with the obligations set forth in a confidentiality contract concluded by Mr. Perkins and the Argentine Government, which remain valid today;\n\nc. That the Argentine Republic has opposed to Mr. Perkins\u2019 testimony from the outset of these proceedings;\n\nd. That any reference to Mr. Mahal\u2019s testimony are speculative; and\n\ne. That Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention could not apply to the relationship between Mr. Perkins and the Argentine Republic.\n\n4. The Tribunal notes that, by letter of January 6, 2006, the Argentine Republic indicated its desire to cross-examine Mr. Hector Mairal during the forthcoming hearing on the merits. The Tribunal thus understands that the Argentine Republic will avoid any conduct that may impair Mr. Mahal\u2019s ability to provide oral testimony in these proceedings;\n\n5. The Tribunal notes that, under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention, witnesses shall enjoy immunity from legal process with respect to acts performed by them in the proceedings irrespectively of their nationality;\n\n6. The Tribunal also notes that, pursuant to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, consent of the parties to arbitration shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy;\n\n7. Finally, the Tribunal notes, in accordance with, ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(3) the parties shall cooperate with the Tribunal in the production of the evidence;\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal has accordingly decided to adopt the following Order:\n\n1. Mr. Perkins\u2019 written statement is admissible;\n\n2. The Argentine Republic shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure full compliance with the ICSID provisions referred to above;\n\n3. In particular, the Argentine Republic shall refrain from any conduct or omission that may, in any way, impair Mr. Perkins\u2019 ability to provide oral testimony in these proceedings;\n\n4. The compliance with this Order shall be assessed by the Tribunal in due course.\"\n\n38.\n\nBy letter dated January 17, 2006, the Claimant informed the Tribunal its decision to withdraw the testimony of two of its witnesses.\n\n39.\n\nBy further letter of January 30, 2006, the Tribunal also informed the parties of its decisions on the series of issues raised by them in the correspondence exchanged from January 23 through 26, 2006, as follows:\n\n\"I write on instructions of the President of the Tribunal in connection with the parties\u2019 recent exchange of correspondence regarding the arrangements for the forthcoming hearing on the merits in the present case.\n\nThe Tribunal, having reviewed the Argentine Republic\u2019s letter of January 23, 25 and 26, 2006 and Claimants\u2019 letter of January 23, 24 and 26, 2006, has decided as follows:\n\ni. The testimony of Professor Diego J. Dzodan is admissible, as the Tribunal wishes to have all the information pertinent to issues of valuation;\n\nii. Because of the late filing of Professor\u2019s Dzodan expert report, Claimants\u2019 request to examine the expert Abdala and/or Spiller for one hour after the Respondent\u2019s experts, including Professor Dzodan, is admitted;\n\niii. The Tribunal wishes to invite the parties to include in any post-hearing brief they may agree to produce, a brief final discussion of valuation issues;\n\n[...]\n\nvi. Production by the parties of witness or expert transcripts made at other hearings is not admissible as contrary to the principle of confidentiality of proceedings.\"\n\n40.\n\nThe hearing on the merits was held, as scheduled, from Monday, February 6 through Tuesday February 20, 2005, in Santiago de Chile. Present at the hearing were:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal:*\n\nProf. Francisco Orrego Vicuna, President\n\nThe Hon.

Messrs. Bishop, Coriell and Miles addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant. Messrs. Guglielmino and Barraguirre addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Argentine Republic.\n\n44.\n\nBy letter dated February 15, 2006, the Tribunal informed the parties of its decision on a number of matters raised during the February 6-14 hearing, as follows.\n\n\"I write on instructions of the President of the Tribunal as a follow-up to the hearing on the merits in the above proceedings, held in Santiago, Chile on February 6 through 14, 2006.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of Messrs. Patricio Carlos Perkins\u2019, Ra\u00fal D. Bertero\u2019s and Juan Carlos Fassi\u2019s nonattendance of the hearing. The Tribunal has also taken note of Mr. Bertero\u2019s letter dated February 3, 2006, accompanied by counsel for the Claimants during the hearing and of Mr. Fassi\u2019s letter dated February 8, 2006, accompanied by the Argentine Republic during the hearing.\n\nIn this connection and as anticipated during the hearing, the Tribunal, having heard from the parties and after due deliberations, has decided as follows:\n\ni. Notwithstanding Messrs. Bertero\u2019s and Perkins\u2019 absences, their written testimony is admitted, as their absence is due to circumstances beyond their control;\n\nii. In the case of Mr. Fassi, his written expert testimony (the P.A. Consulting Group report) is also admitted, as the Tribunal considers this expert testimony necessary to have a full view of the parties\u2019 position on valuation of damages.\n\nAt the closing of the hearing, the Argentine Republic asked the Tribunal to dismiss the testimony of Mr. Santiago Albarracin and the expert testimony of Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez. As agreed by the parties, Argentina will submit its arguments in support of this request by Tuesday, February 21, 2006, and Claimants will file their response by Tuesday, February 28, 2006.\n\nAlso, in accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement, post hearing briefs will be filed, simultaneously, by the parties on Monday, April 3, 2006. The post hearing briefs will not exceed 35 pages.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has taken note of the parties\u2019 *Agreement on the Discontinuance of the Treatment of Certain Claims* of February 3, 2006, accompanied by the parties during the hearing. In light of this agreement, the Tax Claims described in Chapter VI, Section F of the Claimants\u2019 Consolidated Memorial on the Merits are discontinued in the terms described in the *Agreement.* The Award will also take note of this discontinuance in due course.\"\n\n45.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019 instructions, the Argentine Republic submitted its arguments on its request to dismiss the testimony of Mr. Santiago Albarracin and the expert testimony of Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez on February 21, 2006. Claimant filed, as directed by the Tribunal, its response on February 28, 2006.\n\n46.\n\nOn April 3, 2006 the parties filed their post-hearing briefs.\n\n47.\n\nBy letter of April 3, 2006, the Tribunal informed the parties of its decision regarding Argentina\u2019s request for the dismissal of the testimony of Mr. Santiago Albarracin and of the expert testimony of Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez. By same letter, the Tribunal informed the parties of its decision to retain independent expert advice so as to better understand the underlying assumptions and methodology relied upon in the valuation reports offered by the parties\u2019 experts. The Tribunal\u2019s decision in this regard follows:\n\n\"I write to you, on instruction from the President of the Tribunal, in connection with some pending matters in the above proceedings:\n\ni. In regard to the testimony of Dr. Santiago Albarracin and the expert testimony of Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez:\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed the parties\u2019 arguments on this matter, set forth in their letters of February 21, 2006 (Respondent) and February 28, 2006 (Claimants). After due deliberation, and in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 34, the Tribunal has decided as follows:\n\n(a) Dr. Santiago Albarracin was presented as a factual witness by the Claimants. As such, Dr. Albarracin provided written testimony of what he considered to be true facts. In his oral testimony, Dr. Albarracin added understandings and qualifications to his recollection of the facts. The Tribunal, considering the capacity in which Dr. Albarracin has testified, has decided to admit his testimony only insofar as it refers to facts he claims to have witnessed. The Tribunal will disregard all the qualifications and understandings made by Dr. Albarracin during his oral testimony, as they exceed the scope of the testimony he was called to provide;\n\n(b) The Tribunal has also decided to admit Prof. Jos\u00e9 Alvarez\u2019 expert testimony. The Respondent\u2019s arguments have not persuaded the Tribunal that there is a legal impediment for Prof. Alvarez to provide expert testimony in these proceedings.\"\n\n48.\n\nBy letter dated June 29, 2006, on instructions from the President of the Tribunal, the Secretary sent to the parties a list of the documents in the record provided to the independent evaluation expert for the preparation of his report.\n\n49.\n\nOn July 25, 2006, the Secretariat transmitted to the parties a *Preliminary Methodological Report* prepared by the independent evaluation expert. By that same letter the Tribunal invited the parties to file their observations on the preliminary report by August 16, 2006. By letter dated July 25, 2006, the Argentine Republic asked for a 30-day extension for the filing of its observations on the preliminary report. Claimants opposed such request by letter dated July 26, 2006.\n\n50.\n\nOn October 30, 2006, the Secretary, on instructions from the President of the Tribunal, transmitted to the parties a copy of the independent evaluation expert\u2019s final report. By same letter, the parties were invited to submit observations by November 14, 2006.\n\n51.\n\nOn November 2, 2006, the Secretary, on instructions from the President of the Tribunal, transmitted to the parties a copy of a revised final report by the independent evaluation expert. By same letter, the Tribunal extended the deadline for the parties\u2019 observations to November 17, 2006.\n\n52.\n\nBy letter dated December 12, 2006, the Tribunal requested the parties to submit additional information regarding the tariff base being considered by Argentina\u2019s Ente Nacional Regulador del Gas (ENARGAS) by the end of 2001 (Second Quinquennial Tariff Review of RQT II). Claimant filed the requested information on December 18, 2006. On that same date, the Argentine Republic\u2019s representatives informed the Tribunal that it had asked ENARGAS for the requested information and that it would provide it to the Tribunal upon receipt. The documents were received by the Centre on December 28, 2006, and shortly thereafter transmitted to the Tribunal and the Claimant.\n\n53.\n\nOn February 9, 2007, the Argentine Republic submitted to the Secretariat copies of a decision on liability issued in another pending ICSID case.3 The Claimant opposed to this submission by letter dated February 22, 2007. On February 28, 2007, the Tribunal informed the parties on its decision on this matter as follows:\n\n\"I write to you, on instructions from the President of the Tribunal, in connection with the Argentine Republic\u2019s letter dated February 9, 2007 and counsel for the Claimants\u2019 response thereof dated February 22, 2007.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the parties\u2019 submissions above and, after due deliberation, has decided, in accordance with Rule 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, not to admit the documents enclosed with Argentina\u2019s February 9, 2007 letter. The Tribunal will also disregard Claimants\u2019 observations included in their February 22, 2007 letter that go beyond the question of the admissibility of Argentina\u2019s submission.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the parties\u2019 wish and right to fully present their cases. The Tribunal also understands its duty to conduct the proceedings in an orderly and efficient manner. The Tribunal is confident that the parties in these proceedings have been given plenty of opportunities to fully present their arguments on each issue in dispute. Accepting Argentina\u2019s non-invited submission at this late stage of the proceedings would open the door for a never ending exchange of arguments, unduly burdening both parties.\n\nHaving reached its conclusion for the reasons set above, the Tribunal does not consider necessary to review the relevance of the decision enclosed with Argentina\u2019s submission, which was rendered by a different tribunal, over a distinctive set of facts and in view of a likely different set of arguments and evidence.\n\nThe parties are invited to refrain from filing any further non-invited submission in these proceedings.\"\n\nLG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1); Decision on Liability of October 3, 2006.\n\n54.\n\nBy letter dated March 8, 2007, the Argentine Republic proposed the disqualification of the President of the Tribunal. In its letter, Argentina made reference to the February 28, 2007 decision of the Tribunal rejecting its submission of the decision on liability issued in the *LG&E* case. In its letter, Argentina also requested the President of the Tribunal to indicate which of his coarbitrators have joined him in this decision.\n\n55.\n\nBy letter dated March 12, 2007, the Claimant objected to the Argentine Republic\u2019s disqualification of the President of the Tribunal.\n\n56.\n\nBy letter dated March 13, 2007, the President of the Tribunal declined Argentina\u2019s request, referring to ICSID Arbitration Rule 15(1).\n\n57.\n\nBy letter dated March 16, 2007, the Argentine Republic proposed the disqualification of all Members of the Tribunal in accordance to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n58.\n\nBy letter of March 22, 2007, the Secretary of the Tribunal invited the Members of the Tribunal to provide explanations regarding the disqualification proposal, as envisaged in ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). By same letter, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed the suspension of the proceedings pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n59.\n\nProfessor Francisco Orrego-Vicu\u00f1a and Mr. Marc Lalonde furnished explanations by respective letters dated March 23, 2007. Dr. Sandra Morelli furnished explanations by letter dated March 26, 2007. Copies of these letters were circulated by the Secretary of the Tribunal to the parties on April 4, 2007.\n\n60.\n\nBy letter dated April 12, 2007, Argentina submitted observations to the communications of the Members of the Tribunal. Claimants submitted observations on April 19, 2007.\n\n61.\n\nBy letter of May 2, 2007 Argentina, forwarded to the Tribunal the agreement between UNIREN and Camuzzi titled \"Acta Acuerdo de Adecuaci\u00f3n del Contrato de Licencia de Distribuci\u00f3n de Gas Natural.\"\n\n62.\n\nBy letter dated May 4, 2007, the Argentine Republic requested the Arbitral Tribunal to review the Claimants\u2019 witness testimony of Mrs. Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Alcolumbre which disputes the veracity of the testimony of Mr. George Michael Morgan.\n\n63.\n\nOn May 15, 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID wrote to the Members of the Tribunal requesting them to confirm her understanding that the Tribunal, like other ICSID tribunals, gives due consideration to published decisions, in particular, the Decision of Liability issued in ICSID Case No. ARB/02/01 (LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic).\n\n64.\n\nOn May 16, 2007, the President of the Tribunal, on behalf of the Tribunal, confirmed that the Decision on Liability has been considered by the Tribunal in its deliberations.\n\n65.\n\nBy letter dated May 18, 2007, the Argentine Republic submitted observations to the Tribunal\u2019s letter of May 16, 2007.\n\n66.\n\nBy letter of June 5, 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties that the Chairman of ICSID Administrative Council had rejected the Respondent\u2019s proposal to disqualify the Members of the Tribunal. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 9(6) the proceedings were resumed on this date.\n\n67.\n\nOn June 21, 2007, the proceeding between Camuzzi International S.A. and the Argentine Republic was suspended until January 31, 2008, following an agreement of the parties.\n\n68.\n\nBy letter of June 22, 2007, Sempra Energy International clarifies its definition of \"interest.\"\n\n69.\n\nBy letter dated June 25, 2007, Argentina submitted a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Abraham D. Sofaer by the U.S. State Department dated September 15, 2006, regarding the U.S. position on the interpretation of certain provisions in the U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaties.\n\n70.\n\nBy letter of July 2, 2007, Claimant objected to the submission of the State Department letter. With a letter of the same day Argentina commented on Claimant\u2019s letter of June 22, 2007.\n\n71.\n\nBy letter dated July 6, 2007, Claimant asked the Tribunal to declare inadmissible Respondent\u2019s submission of Ms. Alcolumbre\u2019s labor lawsuit documents and the submission on the merits.\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal continuously deliberated by correspondence, meeting for this same purpose on a number of occasions. Throughout the proceedings, the parties\u2019 numerous procedural applications were promptly and unanimously decided by the Tribunal.\n\n*3. Declaration of Closure of the Proceeding*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1) requires that when the presentation of the case by the Parties is complete, the proceeding shall be declared closed.\n\n74.\n\nHaving reviewed all of the presentations by the parties, the Tribunal, came to the conclusion that there was no request by a Party or any reason to reopen the proceeding, as is possible under ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(2).\n\n75.\n\nAccordingly, by letter dated July 19, 2007, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**C. Considerations**\n---------------------\n\n76.\n\nA number of awards issued by ICSID tribunals have dealt with many issues concerning the measures adopted by the Respondent which have also been brought before this Tribunal. In some instances, counsel for each side has been the same as in previous cases and memorials have been written in similar or identical language. Members of this Tribunal have also sat in other such cases. On occasion, the wording used in the paragraphs that follow resembles that of prior awards, particularly insofar as it concerns the explanation of the positions of the parties and some of the considerations relating thereto. The Tribunal, however, has examined every single argument and petition on the basis of their merits in this proceeding.\n\n*The Stamp Tax Claim* (Discontinuance)\n--------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nClaimant included in paragraph VI of its memorial on the merits (labeled \"The Investment Dispute\") a section named \"Imposition of Illegal Taxes,\" concerning claims related to stamp taxes, provincial gross sales taxes and municipal taxes for the occupation of public domain (\"the Tax Claims\").\n\n78.\n\nDuring the hearing on the merits of February 6-14, 2006, the parties agreed to discontinue the proceedings concerning the Tax Claims.\n\n79.\n\nOn February 15, 2006, at the end of the hearing on the merits, after having heard the position of the parties, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order on Discontinuance of the Stamp Tax Claims embodying the parties\u2019 agreement on the discontinuance, without prejudice to the merits of the proceeding of the stamp Tax Claims.\n\n80.\n\nThe Procedural Order decides as follows:\n\n*[...] the Tribunal has taken note of the parties\u2019* Agreement on the Discontinuance of the Treatment of Certain Claims *of February 3, 2006, accompanied by the parties during the hearing. In light of this agreement, the Tax Claims described in Chapter VI, Section F of the Claimants\u2019 Consolidated Memorial on the Merits are discontinued in the terms described in the Agreement. The Award will also take note of this discontinuance in due course.*\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms in this Award the discontinuance of such Stamp Tax Claim in the terms of the Agreement noted.\n\n*The regulatory framework of Argentina\u2019s Privatization Program*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nArgentina\u2019s privatization program began in 1989 and developed gradually through the adoption of its basic governing legal and regulatory framework. One such basic instrument, introduced in 1991, was the Convertibility Law4 which provided for the convertibility of the Argentine currency and, by means of its implementing Decree (Decree 2128/91), fixed the Argentine peso at par with the United States dollar. Various other measures were directed at opening the economy to foreign trade and investment.\n\nLaw 23,928 of 1991 also known as the Convertibility Law\n\n83.\n\nA second set of rules that is relevant specifically to the privatization of the gas industry, with which the present dispute is concerned, was introduced in 1992 by the Gas Law (Law 24,076) and the implementing regulations embodied in the Gas Decree (Decree 1738/92). Under this regulatory framework, gas transportation was separated from distribution and eight companies were established to conduct distribution activities. This dispute concerns the investment of Sempra International (\"Sempra\") in two companies, Sodigas Pampeana S. A. (\"Sodigas Pampeana\") and Sodigas Sur S. A. (\"Sodigas Sur\"), which in turn are the owners of two such distribution companies, Camuzzi Gas Pampeana (\"CGP\") and Camuzzi Gas del Sur (\"CGS\"), which obtained licenses as a result of the privatization effort.\n\n84.\n\nA third set of rules relevant to this dispute is the Standard Gas Transportation License or \"Model Licence\" approved by Decree 2255/92. This includes the applicable Basic Rules. An \"Information Memorandum\" concerning the privatization of Gas del Estado, the former State-owned transportation and distribution company, together with a \"Pliego\" explaining the bidding rules and the pertinent legal and contractual arrangements, were provided to prospective investors in order to organize the bidding process. The parties dispute the legal significance of these information materials.\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimant explains that in making the decision to invest in CGS and CGP, it relied specifically on the conditions offered by these various legislative and regulatory enactments. The Claimant asserts that these conditions included: (i) a license for a term of 35 years, with a possible 10-year extension; (ii) the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars and their semiannual adjustment according to changes in the U.S. Producer Price Index (\"PPI\"); (iii) a commitment that there would be no price freeze applicable to the tariff system and, if one was imposed, that the licensee had a right to compensation; (iv) the commitment that the license would not be amended by the Government, in full or in part, except with the prior consent of the licensee; (v) a commitment not to withdraw the license except in case of specific breaches listed; and (vi) the principle of indifference in respect of subsidies granted by the Government so that the distributor\u2019s income would not be altered.\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that all of the above were in turn related to the setting of gas tariffs at a level that would ensure that operators received revenues sufficient to cover all reasonable costs, taxes and depreciation, as well as a reasonable profit. In this context, the Claimant asserts, the Government of Argentina made additional representations concerning the immediate and automatic adjustment of tariffs in case the parity between the dollar and the peso experienced a variation, the use of the New York exchange rate for adjustments, and the passing through to consumers of all cost variations resulting from changes in tax provisions. It is further argued that these rights resulted in an allocation of risk with respect to currency fluctuations or devaluation that protected the Licensees from such risks.\n\n87.\n\nThe Government has a different understanding of the meaning and extent of these various elements of the legal and regulatory framework, as will be discussed further below.\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s investment in CGP and CGS*\n------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimant explains that it indirectly owns 43.09% of the shares of Sodigas Sur and Sodigas Pampeana, which in turn, respectively, own 90% and 86.09% of the distribution licensees CGS and CGP. The investment began in April 1996 when the Claimant acquired a 12.5% interest in Sodigas Pampeana and Sodigas Sur from Citicorp Equity Investment for the amount of U.S. $ 48.5 million.\n\n89.\n\nThis participation was increased in March 1998 when the Claimant acquired an additional 9% interest in the Licensees from the Argentine company LomaNegra for an amount of U.S. $ 42.4 million, thus totalling an interest of 21,545%.\n\n90.\n\nOwnership was further increased in October 2000 when the Claimant acquired shares in the Licensees for U.S. $ 159.4 million from Consolidated Natural Gas, thus doubling its participation to a total of 43.09%. Also in October 2000 Sodigas Pampeana acquired in auction from the Government of Argentina an additional 6.35% interest in CGP, totalling a 77.21% interest. On October 11, 2000, Camuzzi Argentina transferred to Sodigas Pampeana an 8.88% direct interest in CGP, which increased Sodigas Pampeana\u2019s interest in CGP to the current 86.09%.\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimant also made in July 1999 a pro-rata share equity contribution of U.S. $ 32.3 million which was used to pay existing Sodigas Mid-Term Notes.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that its total investment amounts to U.S. $ 350 million, corresponding to U.S.$114 million for Sodigas Sur, U.S.$180 million for Sodigas Pampeana and U.S.$56 million loaned by Sempra to CGP and CGS. The Government of Argentina questions the real amount involved in the investment and its actual dates, a matter that the Tribunal will consider to the extent relevant in the context of valuation.\n\n*The measures complained of*\n----------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimant argues that a number of measures adopted by the Government of Argentina in the period 2000-2002 and thereafter have resulted in the permanent abrogation and repudiation of most of the rights it had under the regulatory framework and the License, and that these rights will not be restored. The Claimant asserts that this is particularly so in the case of the measures prohibiting PPI adjustments of tariffs, the derogation of the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars, the unilateral modification of the License by the Government without payment of compensation, and the failure to reimburse subsidies owed.\n\n*The legal claims*\n------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s main argument in this case is that the various measures complained of have been adopted and implemented in violation of specific commitments made to the investors, and of the contractual obligations which the Government undertook under the Licenses, all in a manner contrary to the applicable legal and regulatory framework and the specific guarantees provided under the Argentina-U.S. bilateral investment treaty. All such commitments and guarantees were determinative of the decision to invest in CGS and CGP, the Claimant further asserts.\n\n95.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the wrongful expropriation of the investment has followed from the above abrogation in the forms of direct and indirect, or creeping, expropriation. It is also claimed that fair and equitable treatment and legitimate expectations have been violated, arbitrariness and discrimination have characterized the measures adopted, full protection and security have not been provided to the investor, and the Treaty \"umbrella clause\" has been breached. It follows, according to the Claimant, that all of the guarantees provided under Article IV of the Treaty have been breached.\n\n*The legal defenses*\n--------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe legal defense of the Republic of Argentina is based principally on the arguments that the legal and regulatory framework governing the privatization provided only for the licensees\u2019 right to a fair and reasonable tariff, and that the right to the calculation of the tariffs in U.S. dollars was a feature that could last only so long as the Convertibility Law was in force, but not if this law was abandoned.\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that if the investors relied on the information conveyed by private consulting firms, such as that contained in the Information Memorandum, this cannot be attributed to the Government, which has expressly disclaimed any responsibility for such information.\n\n98.\n\nIn the Government\u2019s view, the legal and regulatory framework of Argentina has been strictly enforced through the adoption of the measures in question, and none of it involves a breach of the Licenses or the Treaty. Moreover, the Government maintains that its responsibility is excluded both under its legislation and jurisprudence on emergency, and also by the rules of international law governing the state of necessity, whether customary or contained in the Treaty.\n\n99.\n\nThe legal claims put forth by the Claimant, and the defenses opposed by the Respondent, will be examined in the necessary detail further below in connection with each of the specific measures complained of, and in the context of the applicable law.\n\n*The first claim: PPI adjustment of tariffs*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n*1. The facts of the claim*\n---------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the tariff system established under the regulatory framework and the License operated relatively smoothly. By the end of that decade, however, the situation began to change as economic, social and political difficulties in the Republic of Argentina became gradually evident. It is in this last context that Government officials met with industry representatives in late 1999 and early 2000 to discuss the suspension of tariff increases. As a result, an agreement was signed on January 10, 2000, postponing for six months the PPI adjustment due on January 1, 2000 and providing for the recovery of the deferred increase with interest for the period from July 1, 2000 to April 30, 2001.5\n\nEnargas Resolutions 1472/00 for CGS and 1473/00 for CGP.\n\n101.\n\nThis agreement, however, would not last long. Within a few months, the Government had insisted that tariffs be frozen altogether for a two-year period. As a result, a second suspension agreement intervened on July 17, 2000, suspending PPI adjustments from July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2002. It further provided that the differences would be placed in an interesting-bearing stabilization fund, and that tariff increases would resume at the end of the suspension period, including with respect to the recovery of the deficits originating in these arrangements (Decree 669/00). The Government expressly stated in this last decree that investments connected to the privatization process were protected by the legislation in force, and especially by the bilateral investment treaties signed by the Government. It should be noted that while the Government considers the above-mentioned agreements to be the outcome of genuine consent by the Parties, the Claimant asserts that they were pressured by the Government into giving consent, and that the motivation behind these measures was political.\n\n102.\n\nNot long after the second agreement was reached, a judicial injunction was requested by the Argentine Ombudsman (\"Defensor del Pueblo de la Naci\u00f3n\") against Decree 669/00 on the ground that it was both unconstitutional and contrary to Argentine law. The injunction was granted on August 18, 2000, suspending this decree pending a ruling on the legality of the PPI adjustment mechanism. The injunction was appealed by both the Government regulatory agency for the gas sector (ENARGAS) and the Ministry of Economy, on the ground that it would upset the economic balance of the license and alter the system of tariffs established in U.S. dollars and their PPI adjustment. Both appellants described the injunction as \"arbitrary\" and a \"true legal outrage.\" The appeal was, however, rejected on October 5, 2000.\n\n103.\n\nOn the basis of this injunction, ENARGAS directed the licensees to suspend all PPI adjustments. It has also rejected all requests for adjustment made since then. This includes the PPI adjustment under the first agreement noted. As a result, no such adjustments have been made since 1999.\n\n2 *The Claimant\u2019s arguments*\n----------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimant explains that the PPI adjustment was an essential guarantee under Article 41 of the Gas Law that was directed at preventing any erosion of tariffs in U.S. dollars, and at establishing an incentive for attracting long-term dollar financing.\n\n105.\n\nIn fact, the Claimant argues in this respect that Article 41 of the Gas Decree provided for the adjustment of tariffs \"in accordance with a formula based on international market indicators,\" a guarantee that was confirmed by the Basic Rules which, as explained in the Information Memorandum also invoked by the Claimant, was specifically related to the PPI. The Claimant asserts that it is a vested right and was so recognized under Decree 669/00 noted above in describing this adjustment as a \"legitimately acquired right.\"\n\n*3. The Respondent\u2019s arguments*\n-------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Government has a different view about the meaning of this measure. The Respondent explains that the PPI adjustment no longer made sense in 2000 when the Argentine economy entered into recession and deflation, with lower costs and prices, and U.S. inflation became considerably higher than that of Argentina, thus making the PPI an unreasonable mechanism that would only lead to tariff increases at a time when the economy was experiencing serious difficulties and, later, when it ended up in a major crisis. Indexation of tariffs was, the Respondent maintains, meant only to reflect the change in the value of goods and services, as had been expressly envisaged in Article 41 of the Gas Law. This is what in the Respondent\u2019s view justifies the need for the agreements made with the licensees, and together with the interests of consumers was also the issue considered by the judge granting the injunction. In any event, it is asserted, the Government in suspending this adjustment was only complying with a binding judicial decision, even if did not agree with its terms.\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondent also argues in this connection that as the purpose of the PPI adjustment was simply to reflect the evolution of cost changes, it cannot be understood as a guarantee to ensure a given value of tariffs in U.S. dollars. The Respondent takes the view, contrary to that of the Claimant, that the costs envisaged include operational costs which are a part of the concept of fair and reasonable tariffs according to the Gas Law.\n\n108.\n\nIn any event, it is also maintained by the Respondent that the suspension of the adjustment was first agreed with the licensees and next ordered by the judicial injunction of August 2000. It is also maintained that the fact that the Government appealed the injunction with arguments shared by the Claimant does not mean that the Government should at present ignore the decisions of the Argentine judiciary in dismissing the appeal, in contravention of its duty under the Argentine Constitution and administrative law.\n\n*4. Additional discussions about the ENARGAS resolutions*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe parties have also contested the meaning of the ENARGAS Resolution that ordered the observance of the judicial injunction of August 2000 (Resolution 3480/00). In the Claimant\u2019s view, the Resolution went beyond the judicial suspension, which referred only to the adjustments embodied in the second agreement (i.e., those due as from July 1, 2000), and not also to what had been agreed for the first semester in the first agreement. On these bases, the Claimant requested the reconsideration of the ENARGAS Resolution, but this request was denied. The Respondent explains that the Resolution in question established only that the injunction should be observed and the tariffs managed accordingly.\n\n*5. The Tribunal\u2019s findings on the first claim*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal observes at the outset that it is correct to argue that Article 41 of the Gas Law, while providing for the adjustment of tariffs in accordance with a formula based on international market indicators, also related this formula to the change in value of goods and services. The formula was not defined under the Law, however. This task was left to the Basic Rules of the License, which provided in this respect that tariffs were to be adjusted semi-annually in accordance with the PPI. This was the information also conveyed to investors by the Information Memorandum.\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that the Government shared this understanding at the time and indeed for almost a whole decade. This explains Decree 669/00, which dealt specifically with this mechanism and referred to the adjustment under it as a \"legitimately acquired right\", thereby expressing an unequivocal recognition of the existence of such a right.\n\n112.\n\nIt may also be noted that when the Chilean gas carrier *Colbun* pretended to pay in pesos for billings under export contracts on the ground that the PPI had been eliminated, and the case was taken to court, the view taken by ENARGAS and adopted by the Court of Appeals in that case affirmed that U.S. dollar-denominated tariffs and the PPI adjustment remained unaffected in respect of export contracts, and thus that such a right was quite independent of the question of costs and even of the Convertibility Law, which by that time had been derogated.6\n\nENARGAS response and Court of Appeals decision of May 27, 2005 in *Colbun S. A. v. Ente Regulador del Gas,* both as introduced by the Claimant in cross-examination of the Respondent\u2019s expert Dr. Gabriel Bouzat.\n\n113.\n\nEven if the Information Memorandum was in fact prepared by private consultants and the Government expressly disclaimed responsibility for it, and even if there had been some error in this respect, what is unlikely in the case of highly prestigious consulting firms engaged by the Government to explain the privatization plan to prospective foreign investors, such errors would have passed unnoticed by competent government officials. Moreover, the Government would in such a situation have been duty-bound to issue a clarification to avoid the engendering of a false legitimate expectation. No such clarification was ever issued. It is thus the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the licensees had a right to enjoy the PPI adjustment under both the regulatory framework and the License.\n\n114.\n\nThis is not to deny the Government\u2019s sovereign authority to change its mind, as in fact it later did. Its rationale might have been perfectly reasonable in the light of changing economic conditions in the country, a matter which is not for the Tribunal to judge. But even to achieve this end, the Government had other mechanisms available under the License and the regulatory framework, including the quinquennial tariff revision (Revision Quinquenal de Tarifas or RQT). Mr. Patricio Carlos Perkins, a witness for the Claimant who had important responsibilities during the privatization process and in the preparation of the License, has explained that under \"a price cap regime, between every periodic tariff review, tariffs are solely adjusted based on automatic indexes... to assure the regulated company that the value of tariffs remain constant in real terms.\"7 One such revision had already taken place (\"RQT I\") and another was begun to govern the tariffs precisely as from 2002 (\"RQT II\"), but this latter procedure was never finalized. If the Government decided to take a different route, this cannot be to the detriment of investors\u2019 rights.\n\nAdditional Witness Statement of Mr. Patricio Carlos Perkins of May 2005, par 23.\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal understands the meaning of the ENARGAS Resolution in the context of the related judicial injunction of PPI adjustments and this latter action\u2019s object. While the Claimant is right to point out that the injunction did not refer to adjustments relating to the first agreement, it is clear that the injunction in question sought to suspend the increase of tariffs in general. ENARGAS cannot be faulted for having so understood it. It must be kept in mind that the first agreement\u2019s undertakings would have also begun to materialize during the second semester of 2000, the period with which the injunction was concerned.\n\n*The second claim: \"Pesification of tariffs \" under the Emergency Law*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. The facts of the claim*\n---------------------------\n\n116.\n\nOn January 6, 2002 the Government enacted Law No. 25,561, also known as the \"Emergency Law.\" The essence of the Law\u2019s purpose was the elimination of the right to calculate tariffs in U.S. dollars, and the conversion of tariffs to pesos at the fixed rate of exchange of one dollar to one peso. The Law further authorized the Government to devalue the peso, which a few days later was fixed at a new exchange rate of 1.40 pesos per dollar. A month later, this rate was replaced by a floating exchange rate system.\n\n*2. The Claimant\u2019s arguments*\n-----------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that of the several tariff-related guarantees mentioned above, the one concerning the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars is paramount and was abrogated by the Emergency Law. The Claimant maintains that this guarantee against currency fluctuations was the central and essential protection offered to attract foreign investors to the privatization process. The Claimant further asserts that its claim is unrelated to the issue of devaluation, and is likewise unrelated to questions arising under the Convertibility Law, as the Respondent argues. The Claimant instead bases its claim on the alleged breach of guarantees made available to investors in order to keep them clear of the extreme fluctuations that had historically characterized the Argentine economy.\n\n118.\n\nIn support of this view, the Claimant invokes in particular Article 41 of the Gas Decree, which provides that \"Transportation and Distribution Tariffs shall be calculated in Dollars.\" Similarly, Article 9.2 of the Basic Rules indicates that the \"tariff has been calculated in US dollars.\" The tariff would then be expressed in pesos at the time of billing. The Claimant further contends that this understanding is confirmed by the minutes of a Privatization Committee meeting held on October 2, 1992, which state in connection with Article 9.2 of the Basic Rules that it \"makes sufficiently clear that the tariffs are in dollars and that they are expressed in convertible pesos, and, therefore, in case of an eventual amendment to the Convertibility Law, they should be automatically re-expressed at the modified parity.\" In the view of the Privatization Committee, this understanding made it unnecessary to include additional rules in the License concerning this guarantee.\n\n119.\n\nThe Claimant further invokes a number of provisions in confirmation of this understanding, among which is the wording of Annex F of the Pliego, to the effect that tariffs \"shall be adjusted immediately and automatically in the event that parity varies,\" and thus that the \"quantity of Argentine currency necessary to acquire a US dollar in the New York market shall be applied.\"\n\n120.\n\nThe Claimant also invokes in support of its argument the opinion of several witnesses and legal experts. For example, Mr. Philip Dexter Peacock states in this context that the \"assets simply could not be marketed unless tariffs were to be calculated in U. S. dollars,\" particularly because of the high risk of inflation in Argentina at the time of the privatization, and also due to the experience of the preceding years.8 Although the Convertibility Law was in force at the time these arrangements were made, it was not in the view of Professor Hector Mairal relevant to the existence of the Licensees\u2019 rights to calculate tariffs in US dollars since that law concerned only the question of \"peso holders to change their pesos into dollars, but not with the exchange rate between the peso and the dollar\"9 Mr. Perkins\u2019s witness statement in this respect will be considered further below.\n\nWitness Statement of Philip Dexter Peacock of June 21.2003 Cl. Exh. 7B, paras. 14-15.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Professor Elector A. Mairal of September 14, 2005, Cl. Exh 188, para. 34.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimant also maintains that while the Government has recognized the difficulties many companies are going through, and on occasion has been willing to authorize small emergency adjustments, these have been systematically blocked by court injunctions. The Tribunal must note in connection with this argument that the licensees in this case have reached in 2007 an agreement with the Government as to certain tariff adjustments which the Tribunal will examine further below. The Bill on National Public Utilities, introduced by the Government in Congress in 2004, has in the Claimant\u2019s view also been a cause of concern because, if approved, it would result in the final and complete abandonment of the regulatory system and the conditions governing the licenses. The Claimant also argues that a trusteeship arrangement established for the expansion of the gas transportation network does not benefit the existing licensees despite the inclusion of a tariff adjustment. To the contrary, the Claimant asserts, the new scheme benefits only new investors.\n\n*3. The Respondent\u2019s arguments*\n-------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Government attaches an entirely different meaning to the developments outlined above. It first explains that the crisis that erupted in full force in late 2001 has been among the most severe in world economic history, with dramatic consequences in social well-being and increased poverty, deep recession, deflation and unemployment, all of it leading to catastrophic political events and institutional collapse. The Respondent further explains that in this context, the Government had no other option than to enact the Emergency Law and abandon the convertibility regime. The Respondent points out that the pesification of contracts and financial obligations that followed was applied to the Argentine economic system as a whole and did not particularly target foreign investors in utility companies.\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent believes that the essential provision governing this issue is embodied in Article 2 of the Gas Law, which provides that tariffs shall be fair and reasonable. This concept is also included in Article 2(6) of the Gas Decree in terms of the obligations which ENARGAS must ensure. The concept of a fair and reasonable tariff is connected, in the view of the Government, to the objectives of covering operating costs, taxes and depreciation, and earning a reasonable income, all within the framework of an efficient operation providing satisfactory service at the least possible cost and a return similar to other activities of comparable risk.\n\n124.\n\nIn this context, the Respondent contends that the reference made to the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars, and the related PPI adjustment, could only be understood as being inextricably related to the Convertibility Law in that they were established in the normative framework governing the privatization of the gas industry. This is confirmed, the argument follows, by the express reference of Article 41 of the Gas Decree to the fact that tariffs shall be expressed in pesos convertible under the Convertibility Law, and taking into account the parity established in Article 3 of the Regulatory Decree of the Convertibility Law (Decree No. 2,128/91), namely the one-to-one parity between the peso and the dollar. The Respondent finds further confirmation of this link to the Convertibility Law in Article 9.2 of the License, which also referred to Article 3 of the Regulatory Decree of the Convertibility Law and its eventual modifications.\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent asserts, moreover, that the mechanism envisaged only the possibility of a modification of the peso-dollar relationship under the Convertibility Law, but not a situation in which the Convertibility Law was altogether abandoned. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the modification of the parity under the Convertibility Law is different from the abandonment of the Law. The Respondent believes that in the latter scenario, the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars no longer made any sense, and explains that this was also the understanding of the Privatization Committee, which recorded in its minutes of July 17, 1992 that the parity should be adjusted in accordance with the New York market and that \"the proposed adjustment is not based on the present exchange rate, but on the convertibility exchange rate.\" The Committee concluded that \"as long as Argentina does not abandon the convertibility regime no adjustment of tariffs shall take place under this concept.\"10\n\nMinutes of the Privatization Committee, July 17, 1992, Exhibit 43 to Argentine\u2019s counter memorial.\n\n126.\n\nThe Respondent also reads the above-referenced minutes of the Privatization Committee of October 2, 1992 as expressly conditioning upon the Convertibility Law the adjustment of tariffs in case of modification of the parity. The Respondent argues that this is so particularly because the Committee, in concluding that the License offered a sufficient guarantee in this respect, rejected a proposal by Mr. Perkins that would have provided for adjustment in case convertibility was abandoned. The Respondent further maintains that the Gas Decree makes no mention at all of the possibility of the Convertibility Law\u2019s abandonment.\n\n127.\n\nAlthough the above-noted Annex F of the Pliego seems to convey a broader conception of tariff adjustment in case of parity modification, the Respondent points out that this Annex was held to be merely descriptive. The Respondent ascribes this same quality to the Information Memorandum, on which the Claimant also relies. The Respondent explains that this latter document is non-binding and was not prepared by the Government, which expressly disclaimed any responsibility for it.11 It is further observed that in any event the Memorandum was prepared before the regulatory framework was enacted.\n\nLegal Opinion of Mr. Gabriel Bouzat and Mr. Carlos F. Rosenkrantz, Rebuttal Opinion, paras. 20-23 filed with Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder. See also Argentina\u2019s counter memorial at para. 172-173.\n\n*4. Discussion of the historical experience*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe parties\u2019 views of this specific claim have also differed significantly in respect of their arguments concerning the historical experience of the privatization of ENTEL, the national telecommunications company. The Respondent asserts that this privatization confirms that the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars was inextricably related to the Convertibility Law.\n\n129.\n\nENTEL was privatized under the Law on the Reform of the State, albeit before the Convertibility Law was enacted. Tariffs had originally been set in \"Australes,\" the Argentine currency at the time, and adjusted in accordance with the Consumer Price Index of Argentina (IPC). The Respondent explains that because the Convertibility Law froze tariffs and adjustments in pesos, the parties agreed to express tariffs in U.S. dollars and to adjust them on the basis of PPI variations. This was, however, done without specific reference to the Convertibility Law, unlike in the cases of CGS and CGP. The Respondent finds this evolving framework to be evidence that no exchange rate assurance was given. Consequently, in the Respondent\u2019s view, the devaluation risk was not eliminated or shifted to the Government, as argued by the Claimant, and the Respondent received no compensation for any such currency risk.12\n\nArgentina\u2019s counter memorial, p. 65.\n\n130.\n\nThe Claimant draws the opposite conclusion about this historical experience. It first explains that even before any changes were made, the ENTEL tariffs included a U.S. dollar component to temper devaluation effects that was automatically triggered if certain ratios were met. The Claimant next maintains that the changes introduced after the Convertibility Law was enacted, were made precisely to ensure that no adverse effects would ensue for the investors, and thus to provide incentives for new investments.\n\n131.\n\nThe Claimant finds additional confirmation of the lack of relation between the system and the Convertibility Law in the fact that the tariffs calculated in U.S. dollars were to be billed in pesos at the exchange rate applicable at the time of billing. The Claimant also explains that underwriting arrangements made with banks, and the placement of the remaining shares of the telecommunications company in the New York and Buenos Aires markets, resulted in additional benefits to the Government that would not have been possible had the risk of currency fluctuation not been eliminated under the tariff system.\n\n*5. The discussion about country risk*\n--------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nAnother issue dividing the parties is whether tariffs were higher because they included a premium for the risk that convertibility might be abandoned at some point in the future. The Respondent equates this \"convertibility risk\" with country risk or default risk, and argues that if the licensees were guaranteed that U.S. dollar tariffs would be converted to pesos at the prevailing exchange rate, they would be obtaining a double benefit since the tariffs were already set higher to offset this risk.13\n\nLegal Opinion by Experts Mr. Gabriel Bouzat and Mr. Carlos F. Rosenkrantz, Second Legal Opinion, paras. 32-35.\n\n133.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the establishment of the original tariffs took into consideration the debt bonds of the Argentine Republic (Bonex 1989), and resulted in a higher debt cost of 9.50%. RQT I also considered a 6.47% country risk, while RQT II envisaged a figure of 7.40% on this basis, with all of it leading to additional return over the invested capital. The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that RQT I was finalized and implemented while RQT II was in an advanced stage of preparation but did not materialize as a result of the emergency measures. The Respondent concludes from this that the Claimant cannot pretend at one time to charge higher tariffs for a risk, and later, if the risk actually materializes, argue that it should not bear such a risk.\n\n134.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that such an argument is wrong because country risk relates only to a default on sovereign debt, which is conceptually different from the risk concerning \"pesification\" and the freezing of tariffs. The latter was, in the Claimant\u2019s view, allocated to the Government through the License and the envisaged tariff system, for which the investors, not the Government, paid more for shares benefiting from this guarantee.\n\n*6. The Constitutional debate*\n------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe Respondent asserts on this distinct issue that gas distribution licenses entail a relationship governed by public law, which must take into account not only the interest of the parties concerned but also the public interest. To calculate tariffs in U.S. dollars independently of the Convertibility Law would in the Respondent\u2019s view be unconstitutional since it would be contrary to reasonableness, the Constitution and the Gas Law. In the view of a witness for the Respondent, were rates to have been denominated in U.S. dollars at a parity different from that of the Convertibility Law, \"the exchange risk would have eventually passed on to the users, who are the least prepared to face the financial issues of the utility providers.\"14 In any event, the Respondent maintains that it would be contrary to the Argentine legal system to keep tariffs in U.S. dollars in the context of a floating rate system.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Cristian Folgar of July 2005, para. 48.\n\n136.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s opposing view, the basic constitutional principle relevant to the situation is instead the respect of private property. The Claimant contends that this cannot be ignored by the Government after it enacted the rights and guarantees offered to investors pursuant to its own regulatory powers. It is additionally argued that a fundamental principle of the legal system is that if the economic equation of a contract is not respected, the resulting losses must be compensated.\n\n7. *Discussion about an incomplete regulatory framework*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nStill one other issue divides the opinion of the parties in connection with the meaning of the tariff system. In the Respondent\u2019s view, because the regulatory framework was incomplete and did not foresee what should be done in case the Convertibility Law was abandoned, it falls upon the Government to adapt the licenses to the new situation. The Respondent explains that this was done by means of the pesification of the whole economy, the dollarization of export-related tariffs, and the renegotiation of contracts and licenses.15\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Cristian Folgar of July 2005, para. 40 *et seq.*\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that this adaptation is the duty of the Government in respect of a public utility service, and that such regulatory powers are exercised in a discretionary manner, as is accepted practice in economic theory and judicial decisions in both Argentina and other countries, particularly in respect of adaptation necessitated by a major economic crisis. The Respondent also invokes Supreme Court decisions in Argentina to the effect that there is no right to normative stability since no one is entitled to the maintenance of any law or regulation, and that the amendment of norms by other norms cannot be considered as being contrary to a right under the Constitution.\n\n139.\n\nThe Claimant contends in opposition that the regulatory framework cannot be considered incomplete because all of the assurances given were specifically related to the possibility that the Convertibility Law might be abandoned in the future. The only purpose of the Emergency Law in this context, it is maintained, was to unilaterally change the tariff system and its related aspects. Moreover, the Claimant argues, none of the mechanisms provided under the License to undertake a tariff revision were employed.\n\n140.\n\nThe Claimant also points out that the Argentine legislation itself provides all necessary guarantees in terms of fundamental safeguards of acquired rights and legitimate expectations, as has been repeatedly held by the Argentine Supreme Court. It is further argued that even the regulatory powers of governments which are recognized in cases of changed circumstances are limited and subject to specific conditions, and do not reach into questions of compensation and financial advantages. Least of all, the argument goes, do they alter the economic balance of the contract. The Claimant further asserts that it was precisely in order to provide for a clear limit to these powers that the Government included in the License the guarantee that it could only be amended with the consent of the parties, and that it could not be terminated except in very specific situations.\n\n*8. The Tribunal\u2019s findings on the US dollar calculation of tariffs*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant\u2019s arguments about the existence of a right to the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars are persuasive. This conclusion is based first on the examination of the legal and regulatory framework. If the Gas Law, Gas Decree and Basic Rules of the License all unequivocally refer to the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars, and if such feature was also explained in the same terms by the Information Memorandum, there cannot be any doubt that this is the central feature governing the tariff regime.\n\n142.\n\nGiven the emphasis that this regulatory framework placed on the stability of the tariff structure, it is not surprising that the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars, as well as the PPI adjustment, were assigned a significant role therein. While the possibility of devaluation intervening at some time was not ignored, it was hardly addressed from the viewpoint of stability being the principal aim or, as will be explained, from that of the problem being corrected by means of the automatic adjustment of tariffs to the new exchange rate level.\n\n143.\n\nThe Respondent has devoted particular attention to the link which it alleges exists between these clauses and the Convertibility Law. As previously noted, the Respondent believes that if tariffs were set in U.S. dollars independently of the terms of the Convertibility Law, this would result in a situation contrary to the Constitution. Sophisticated investors and their lawyers, it is further asserted, could not have relied solely on the information conveyed by unofficial documents, such as the Information Memorandum or Annex F of the Pliego, which were issued with an express disclaimer of Government responsibility for their content. A legal expert for the Respondent, asked at the hearing whether the Convertibility Law implied assurances in terms of the exchange rate, answered: \"No, there were no assurances in terms of the exchange rate.\"16 This expert and another also stated in their written opinion that the reply to the question of an exchange rate guarantee must be \"firmly negative.\"17\n\nExpert Statement of Mr. Gabriel Bouzat, Elearing Transcript, Vol. 4, February 9, 2006, pp. 707-708.\n\nLegal Opinion of Mr. Gabriel Bouzat and Mr. Carlos F. Rosenkrantz, Second Legal Opinion, para. 16.\n\n144.\n\nThe Respondent is correct in pointing out that the Gas Law provides that tariffs calculated in U.S. dollars shall be expressed in pesos convertible under the Convertibility Law, and that reference is made to the need to take into account the parity established under Decree 2128/91, which regulated the convertibility regime.\n\n145.\n\nThese provisions are not, however, inconsistent with a guarantee as to the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars. Convertibility, as the Claimant has argued in reliance upon the above-noted opinion of Professor Mairal, is of a different nature than the matter of a given parity or exchange rate. This is because convertibility relates simply to the right to buy a certain foreign currency with local currency. This view is shared by legal experts for the Respondent.18 It is the exchange rate that will determine how much local currency you will need to buy a unit of the foreign one. Because the Convertibility regime was aiming at the stabilization of the Argentine economy following a period of galloping inflation and continued devaluation of the currency, it chose to do the two things at the same time. It first confirmed the right to convertibility of the currency, which has remained unaffected. It simultaneously pegged the peso to the U.S. dollar at the one-to-one parity, while also prohibiting indexation in pesos. This fixed parity is the one no longer available following the peso\u2019s devaluation and the adoption of a floating rate system.\n\nLegal Opinion by Mr. Gabriel Bouzat and Mr. Carlos F. Rosenkrantz, Rebuttal Opinion, para. 54.\n\n146.\n\nThis difference is reflected in the regulatory framework with which the Tribunal is concerned. The Gas Law indeed made a link to the first aspect by referring to pesos convertible under the Convertibility Law. The reference of the License to a given parity established under the convertibility decree was more qualified, however. In fact, Clause 9.2 of the License takes into account the fact that the parity and the ratio could be amended in the future, as it expressly refers to the eventual modifications of convertibility through Decree 2128/91. Further references of the Pliego to the New York market exchange rate must be understood in the same context.\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal must also note that the standing of the Pliego is not extraneous to the investors\u2019 understanding. While not an official document, it was reviewed by government agencies, and there appears to have been a shared understanding about its meaning at the time. The witness statement of Mr. Peacock explains that the Pliegos were certainly carefully reviewed by Sindicatura General de Empresas P\u00fablicas (SIGEP), the government agency responsible for the surveillance and auditing of State-owned enterprises. He further explains the process of their preparation:\n\n\"Those of us who produced them were schooled in the U.S. system mandated by the Securities Act of 1933, and we undertook the drafting of the representations contained in the Pliegos with the same seriousness as we would have if we had been drafting a \u201933 Act prospectus. I myself considered that the Argentine Government was bound by the representations it made to prospective purchasers in the Pliegos, and I believe every person involved in the process, including especially the Argentines, believed so too.\"19\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Philip Dexter Peacock of June 21.2003, para. 32.\n\n148.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal is mindful of the economic context in which convertibility and the ensuing privatization were introduced. Precisely because these measures were preceded by a long period of economic turmoil, investors would not be attracted to participate in the privatization process unless specific assurances were given in respect of the stability of their arrangements. These were the specific guarantees envisaged in the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars, their conversion at the time of billing into pesos at the prevailing exchange rate and its PPI adjustment, and other stabilization mechanisms found in the contractual arrangements. Mr. George Michael Morgan, a witness for the Claimant explained that the \"assurances that we were given were in the absence of a specific convertibility scheme.\"20\n\nTestimony of Mr. George Michael Morgan, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 1, February 6, 2006, para. 184.\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent requested the Tribunal on June 29, 2007 to exclude the witness testimony of Mr. George Michael Morgan on the ground that another prospective witness for the Claimant, Ms. Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Alcolumbre, had brought to the Respondent\u2019s attention a complaint that she had been pressured by officials of the Claimant company to provide a witness statement not in accordance with the truth, concerning in particular financial matters relating to this case, and having refused to do so her testimony was replaced by that of Mr. Morgan as her employment was terminated. Ms. Alcolumbre also began judicial proceedings against the Claimant in Argentina on such employment matters. The Claimant explained that Ms. Alcolumbre had been withdrawn as a witness on January 17, 2006, before the hearing, and that her complaints were directed to obtain better compensation after her dismissal. The Claimant also provided explanations on the substance of the financial questions complained of.\n\n150.\n\nWhile the jurisdiction to hear the complaints by Ms. Alcolumbre is with the Argentine courts, this Tribunal has considered the request for excluding the witness statement of Mr. Morgan. The Tribunal does not believe that there is ground to exclude such testimony, first because the allegations against the witness need to be proven, and this again will be done before the courts to the extent related to her dismissal, and next because the issues on which Mr. Morgan has testified are also addressed by other witness statements and material in the record. Such testimony, while illustrative of the Claimant\u2019s view, is thus not determinative of the conclusions of the Tribunal.\n\n151.\n\nThe distinction drawn by the Respondent between the modification of the convertibility regime and its abandonment is unpersuasive. Guarantees and stabilization are meant to operate specifically when problems arise, not when business continues as usual. The tariff regime approved was devised as a permanent feature of the privatization, not a transitory one. If a temporary duration was actually intended, it should have been clearly indicated to prospective investors. Again, however, nothing of the sort was done. The regulatory and contractual arrangements were thus not incomplete, as has been argued. If such were the case, it would certainly not have passed unnoticed by competent officials, businessmen and lawyers.\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal must observe that the Privatization Committee\u2019s discussion of the matter was at times confusing. The Respondent has, as noted above, invoked in its favor the minutes of the Privatization Committee of July 17, 1992, which a few weeks after the enactment of the Gas Law made reference to the adjustment of tariffs, not at the actual exchange rate, but at the convertibility rate. They further stated that unless convertibility was abandoned there should be no adjustments on this basis. The minutes made additional references to the adjustment of parity in the New York market and to an understanding of the Committee to the effect that licensees should be assured of adjustment according to a realistic exchange rate if convertibility was abandoned.\n\n153.\n\nWhile these minutes could be read as allowing for adjustment under the convertibility regime rather than upon its abandonment, a different reading is also possible. In fact, the Committee was discussing two different kinds of adjustment. It first discussed the notion of an automatic adjustment undertaken in accordance with the variation of cost structure expressed in pesos, but this was ruled out since it meant an indexation forbidden under the Convertibility Law. It is in relation to this cost adjustment that reference was made to the convertibility exchange rate. Reference was also made to the view that no adjustments should take place on this basis unless convertibility was abandoned, and if such were the case, a realistic exchange rate should then be found for the adjustment.\n\n154.\n\nAt the same time, the Committee discussed an adjustment related to the parity and its eventual modifications. This was the one that the regulatory framework and the License eventually included in their terms. This is the kind of adjustment that would follow the New York market exchange rate, and was expressly referred to as the \"adjustment for parity.\" This was what the Committee later addressed in the minutes of October 2, 1992, which were invoked by the Claimant in support of its own view. The Committee was recorded in the minutes as deciding to reject a proposal referring expressly to the abandonment of the convertibility regime, on the ground that Clause 9.2 of the License embodied a sufficient guarantee in connection with the adjustment at the modified exchange rate.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal also wishes to consider on this point the witness statement of Mr. Perkins who, as previously noted, was a key official in the privatization process and the author of the initiative that the Committee addressed on October 2, 1992. In referring to the approach followed by the Government officials at the time, Mr. Perkins explains that since indexation in pesos was prohibited under the Convertibility Law, assurances of U.S. dollar-denominated tariffs had become crucial to attract potential bidders, but that there were different views as to how to express this criterion. Some officials, like the witness himself, pressed for a clear reference to U.S. dollar tariff rates, while others considered that the reference to the Convertibility Law and its Decrees was sufficiently clear to this effect.21 In the end, there was a compromise decision reached in the Privatization Committee to denominate tariffs in dollars and express them in local currency at the rate prevailing on the billing date. Mr. Perkins explains this decision as follows:\n\n\"The guarantee that tariffs would be calculated in US Dollars was a matter of significant discussion within the Privatization Committee.... After significant discussion, it was eventually decided that including an express provision for a tariff adjustment in the event of a modification of the dollar-peso parity was redundant in view of the provisions of Section 9.2 of the draft License.\"22\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Patricio Carlos Perkins of June 2, 2003, paras. 288-290.\n\nAdditional Witness statement of Mr. Patricio Carlos Perkins of May 2005, para. 16.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal would have wished that Mr. Perkins had been examined and cross-examined on this and other aspects of his testimony, and also that questions had been put to him. His participation in the hearing on the merits was, however, regrettably prevented by an injunction issued by an Argentine judge on November 24, 2005 at the request of the Government. In the Respondent\u2019s view, there had been contractual relations between the Government and Mr. Perkins that made his statement in this and other arbitrations inadmissible. The Tribunal draws no inference from this situation, but did decide that the witness\u2019s written statement was admissible and that Mr. Perkins enjoyed and continues to enjoy the immunities provided under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention.23\n\nLetter from the Centre to the parties dated January 16, 2006.\n\n157.\n\nThe Respondent also objected on similar grounds to the statements of Mr. Peacock and the opinions of Professor Mairal, but these challenges did not ultimately prevent their admissibility or presentation before the Tribunal.\n\n158.\n\nIn the light of the above discussion, the Tribunal cannot conclude that there was an incomplete regulatory framework in respect of this matter, as the Respondent has argued. The Tribunal would reach the same conclusion independently of Mr. Perkins\u2019 witness statement. In fact, the dollar-denominated tariff was expressly included in the regulatory regime and the Licenses as an additional safeguard, as described by Mr. Perkins: \"In agreeing to the language of Section 9.2 of the License, all involved recognized that the express provision for U.S. Dollar-denominated tariffs was an additional guarantee that would protect the Licensees in the face of an eventual modification of the Convertibility Law and devaluation in the local currency, such as the one that occurred following the Emergency Law in January 2002. \"24 This guarantee, in the view of Professor Mairal, is \"unconditional and has no limitations to it.\"25 Such an allocation of risk is also quite evidently different from the operation of the country risk premium, as will be discussed further below.\n\nAdditional Witness statement of Mr. Patricio Carlos Perkins of May 2005, par. 17\n\nExpert Statement of Professor H\u00e9ctor A. Mairal, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 4, February 9, 2006, p. 640; Claimant\u2019s Post Hearing brief of April 3, 2006, para. 5.\n\n159.\n\nIt has also been explained by another witness that if anyone at the time had expressed the thought that the tariff system was dependent on the continuing existence of the Convertibility Law and the fixed exchange rate,\n\n\"we would have advised that such a contorted construction renders the guarantee useless. The idea that a future Argentine legislature could rescind the guarantee simply by repealing the Convertibility Law makes the guaranty illusory, and the privatization would not have proceeded as it did. Every description of the dollarized tariffs in the privatization documents points to an entirely contrary interpretation.\"26\n\nAdditional Witness statement of Mr. Philip Dexter Peacock of September 16, 2005, para.6.\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal is likewise persuaded by the argument that if the tariff system had not intended to provide for a right to calculate tariffs in U.S. dollars in case of devaluation or currency fluctuation, or ultimately of the abandonment of the Convertibility Law, it would have been futile to resort to such a denomination because a peso-denominated tariff would have accomplished exactly the same result. A further confirmation of this view is found in Article 8 of the Emergency Law, which put an end to the right to U.S. dollar-denominated tariffs. Professor Mairal has explained in this connection that if:\n\n\"Also if the end of convertibility brought about by Law 25,561 would have been enough to end the Licensee rights to dollar-based tariffs, section 8 of Law 25,561 would have been unnecessary. As enacted, said section 8 clearly terminates -as from the date of enactment of the law- a pre-existing right that -had section 8 not been included-would have remained unaffected by the end of the convertibility.\"27\n\nSecond Expert Report of Professor El\u00e9ctor A. Mairal of September 14, 2005, Cl. Exh 188, paras. 37-38.\n\n161.\n\nIn support of its view that the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars is inextricably linked to the Convertibility Law, the Respondent, as already noted, has invoked *inter alia* arguments concerning the historical experience surrounding the privatization of ENTEL. The conclusions which the Tribunal draws from that experience are not quite the same as those of the Respondent.\n\n162.\n\nTo begin with, it is an undisputed fact that because the Convertibility Law froze indexation in pesos and adopted other currency stabilization measures, the terms of the original ENTEL privatization were no longer viable and had to be adapted to the new economic policy. All the changes introduced were done in agreement with the licensee, which makes for an entirely different situation from the present one with the exception of the changes introduced by the 2007 Memoranda of Understanding. The ultimate meaning of a consented agreement was, as argued by the Claimant, to avoid adverse economic consequences for the licensees arising from the changed regulatory measures. This is also a proposition that is different from the present one, with the exception indicated.\n\n163.\n\nWithout prejudice to the Claimant\u2019s argument that the original tariff structure included a U.S. dollar component and other stable value references, the fact that the new ENTEL agreement provided for U.S. dollar-calculated tariffs without reference to the Convertibility Law, far from proving that those tariffs were later inseparable from that law, as the Respondent alleges was also the case with the gas tariffs, rather proves the contrary. If tariffs were calculated in U.S. dollars and converted into pesos without reference to the Convertibility Law in the case of ENTEL, this can well be read as a confirmation of the conclusion that the reference to the Convertibility Law in later arrangements was not a guarantee conditioned to a given parity. On the other hand, the fact that ENTEL\u2019s tariff was unrelated to the Convertibility Law did not spare this company from the consequences of the Emergency Law and related measures.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal is no more persuaded by the argument concerning the country risk premium. That such a premium was considered in the tariff structure and RQT I is undisputed. The issue is whether this premium and the guarantee of tariff adjustment in the case of a tariff freeze and pesification are compatible, or whether they should instead be considered as a kind of \"double dipping\" by the Claimant.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes in this respect that country risk or default risk is related exclusively to the risk of a given country\u2019s default on its foreign debt and, as such, relates to the question of the investment\u2019s financial structure. This makes borrowing more costly and is compensated by means of an additional premium. The guarantee concerning the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars addresses a different kind of risk and responds to a different rationale since it concerns the level of income and revenues of a company as reflected in the tariff system and its eventual adjustments. While these risks can be to some degree interlinked, for example by country risk increasing if the guarantees concerning the tariff system are altered, they operate independently from each other and are subject to different safeguards.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful of the arguments advanced by the parties in connection with the role of the Constitution in this dispute. The Tribunal will consider issues arising under the Constitution and the law in connection with this dispute further below. It must at this point be noted, however, that besides the invocation of different Argentine Supreme Court decisions by both parties in support of their respective views, particular attention has been devoted to the **Maruba** case, which was concerned with the issue of a reduction in tariffs for port-towing services.28 The Respondent invokes this decision to show that there was no entitlement to the original tariff, but only to a reasonable rate of return. The Claimant, meanwhile, distinguishes **Maruba** on the basis that the tariff system was different, was not established by contract, and contained no provisions for its amendment. The Claimant further points out that the Supreme Court held that while the tariff could vary during the concession period, the concessionaire had a right to receive compensation if the new prices altered the economic equation of the concession.\n\n*Maruba Empresa de Navegaci\u00f3n Mar\u00edtima c. Ministerio de Obras y Servicios P\u00fablicos,* Fallos 321:1784, issued on June 30th, 1998, Argentina's Legal Auth. 17.\n\n167.\n\nThe observance of contracts, and the guarantees they embody, cannot be considered inconsistent with a long-standing Constitution such as that of the Argentine Republic. Quite to the contrary, the Argentine Constitution has enshrined the rule of law and guaranteed both the rights enjoyed by citizens and those of others who develop their business in that country. Prominent among these aspects are the right to property and limits placed upon the regulatory powers of the State. The Respondent has rightly noted that licenses and concessions do not depend exclusively on the rules governing private contracts because they have an important administrative component that reflects the nature of a public service. However, neither is this administrative law dimension in any way incompatible with the observance of contracts in the Argentine legal framework. This will be discussed further below.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusion in respect of this claim does not mean that it ignores economic reality or the crisis that has recently affected Argentina. It is perfectly possible that economic conditions can change, as they in fact dramatically did. These changes can have a profound effect on the economic balance of contracts and licenses. In this context, the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Gas Law was concerned principally with a fair and reasonable tariff is not wrong. The regulatory framework provided for specific adjustment mechanisms, particularly if tariffs ceased to be fair and reasonable. These included tariff reviews on a periodic basis and even the possibility of an extraordinary review. The issue then is not whether contracts should remain frozen forever, but whether they can be adjusted to such changing realities in an orderly manner, as is provided under the regulatory framework and the contract itself. Such methods include the negotiated modification of the license, the alternative being that such change will be accomplished by unilateral action of the Government.\n\n169.\n\nThe real problem underlying the claims is that the latter option was taken unreservedly. Broad as the regulatory authority of States and governments might be at present, it can only be exercised within the confines of the law and when duly taking into account the rights of individuals. It will be seen further below that the Argentine legislation and the decisions of that country\u2019s courts have carefully set out the limits of government regulatory power in the light of a long experience of economic crisis and emergency intervention.\n\n*The third claim: The breach of the License\u2019s stability clauses*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Claimant has also argued that the measures adopted by the Respondent resulted in other breaches of the License which concerned some basic guarantees about the stability of this instrument. This claim refers in particular to Clause 9.8, which prohibits the freezing, administration or control of prices, and provides that if prices are lower than the level resulting from the tariff because of controls, the Licensee shall be entitled to compensation for the difference. The claim further refers to Clause 18.2 of the License, under the terms of which the Licensor shall not amend the Basic Rules of the License, in whole or in part, without the written consent of the Licensee.\n\n171.\n\nThis claim relates to the discussion about the question of contractual rights and the meaning of the umbrella clause under the Treaty, which will be examined further below.\n\n172.\n\nThere is, however, an argument of the Respondent that the Tribunal must address at this point. The Respondent asserts that the prohibition of Clause 18.2 refers to the License not being modifiable by the Licensor. Since the Licensor is the Executive Branch of the Government, the Respondent contends that any measures or effects arising from congressional action, such as the Emergency Law, or from judicial decisions, such as the PPI injunction, are not adopted by the Licensor and hence not envisaged in the prohibition on unilateral modification.29 In support of this view, the Respondent relies on Clause 18.3 of the License, which refers to the event in which a given clause of the license is declared invalid or unenforceable by judicial decision. The Respondent further relies on this clause as establishing that every license clause is valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 409-415; Respondent\u2019s Post Hearing, paras. 36-40.\n\n173.\n\nThere can be no doubt that a judicial decision can declare a given provision invalid, just as a law can alter the operation of a contract. The issue here is different, however. First, the provisions of Clause 18.3 relate to situations in which given individual clauses of a license are affected, and in addressing this question ensure that other provisions of the license will remain unaffected through the principle of \"divisibility.\" It does not, however, envisage derogation from the contract or its abandonment. Second, and more important, the issue here does not concern the powers of the State to adjudicate or legislate. It only concerns the question of whether, if contracts to which the State is a party are affected due to executive, judicial or legislative action, any damage to the other party will have to be compensated under the very provisions of the contract or, in this case, under the Treaty. If contract rights were held at the mercy of the Executive or other branches of the State, the rule of law would be seriously in jeopardy. This view is not quite likely to be accepted in an arbitration that is governed at least in part by international law.\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal must also observe that Clause 18.2 of the License, in prohibiting the License\u2019s unilateral modification, makes special reference to the fact that even if an authorized modification under the Service and Tariff Regulations results in a favorable or unfavorable alteration of the existing economic and financial balance, the Licensee will have the right to request a pertinent adjustment of the tariff. It is that economic balance which the whole tariff regime purported to ensure.\n\n*The fourth claim: Failure to reimburse subsidies*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. The Claimant\u2019s arguments*\n-----------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe fourth claim before this Tribunal concerns the alleged failure of the Government to reimburse the subsidies set for residential customers in Patagonia. The Claimant explains that these subsidies ranged from 34% to 87% according to the area, and amounted to 54% of the annual income of CGS. The Claimant further explains that subsidies accounted for 38% of the annual revenues of CGS.\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that these subsidies are governed by the \"Principle of Indifference\" described by Article 48 of Decree 1738/92 as one whereby the distributors\u2019 \"income is not altered, nor must they bear financial costs, or have their regular flow of money collections... modified for such cause.\" The Decree also allows for compensation of the reduced income, or increase in financial costs, caused by subsidies during the fiscal year in which they arise.30 The principle of neutrality has also been explained in the terms that \"the Licensee cannot win as a result of the subsidies, nor can he lose money as a result of the subsidies.\"31 The Claimant argues in this respect that while the Government has recognized its obligations to reimburse subsidies, it has consistently failed to pay Licensees in a timely manner. Various court injunctions were also issued so as to prevent the companies from charging the full tariff in cases of failure to reimburse the subsidies, as was allowed under Section 20.1 of the License.\n\nDecreto 1738/92 -Apru\u00e9base la Reglamentaci\u00f3n de la Ley N. 24,076 que regula la actividad de transporte y distribuci\u00f3n de gas natural como servicio p\u00fablico nacional, September 18, 1992.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Walter Kunz, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 3, February 8, 2006, pp. 530-531.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimant explains that an Agreement reached on December 12, 2001 (\"Subsidies Agreement\") to regularize the payment of AR$ 108,151,227.73 (including principal of AR$75,172,807.88 and interest of AR$32,978,419.85) was never approved, and that the schedule of payments was not observed. The Claimant further asserts that a Trust Fund established to compensate the Licensees as from May 2002 (Decree No. 786/02) was not properly implemented since its assets would not be recognized as separate and intangible, and could accordingly be diverted to other budgetary allocations. The Claimant contends that the Respondent owes subsidies accrued before October 2001, other subsidies accrued in the period October-December 2001, yet other subsidies corresponding to the period January-April 2002, and other payments due under the Trust Fund. Moreover, the Claimant puts forward its view that as subsidies were an integral part of the tariff, and because the tariff was calculated in U.S. dollars, the subsidies owed should be calculated in this last currency before devaluation of the AR peso took place, that is on a one-to-one basis.\n\n2. *The Respondent\u2019s arguments*\n-------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent has a different understanding about the role of subsidies in this dispute. It explains that while subsidies were at first paid directly by the Government to the Licensees, since 1994 yearly budget credits have been transferred to the provinces for the payment of such subsidies, and the Trust Fund was established to regularize their payment as from March 2002. Budget transfers to the provinces were temporarily suspended during 2001 when Argentina\u2019s budgetary problems became acute, but the Government attempted to regularize even this by means of the Subsidies Agreement already noted. This Agreement was in the Respondent\u2019s view never formally approved by the required administrative acts, and hence does not entail any binding obligation.\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that with the approval of the 2002 budget law (Law 25,565), not only was the Trust Fund established to handle future payments, but specific schedules for the payment in installments of past subsidies owed were also approved to begin in 2003. The 2005 budget included other measures for the regularization of payments for the period October-December 2001. It is also explained that the amendments introduced through the Trust Fund\u2019s implementation were aimed at strengthening rather than weakening the availability of funds. The Respondent explains that the end result is that CGS and CGP have received more than AR$330 million in subsidies since December 2001, and that the situation is now entirely normal, to the point that there is at present a claim by CGS before the Ministry of Economy for only 3% in unpaid subsidies.32 In the Respondent\u2019s view, subsidies have been always established in pesos, and so any payment due is to be calculated in that currency and not in U.S. dollars, as is argued by the Claimant.\n\nWitness Statement of Messrs. Nachon, Vera, Labadie, Kunz, filed with Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 25-30.\n\n*3. The Tribunal\u2019s findings about the subsidies claim*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe claim about subsidies has two aspects, and the Tribunal will consider each separately. There is first the question of a right to the subsidies, and particularly whether they are established in AR pesos, as argued by the Respondent, or in U.S. dollars, as argued by the Claimant. This question will be examined now. Thereafter, the Tribunal will examine the second question, which concerns the amounts owed, if any, and whether they are being paid or not. This shall be discussed in the context of valuation issues and related matters.\n\n181.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Claimant is entitled to the payment of subsidies accorded by the Government to residents of some defined provinces. This issue is not questioned by the Respondent. This was the policy followed by ENARGAS from the outset.33 The regulatory framework allows for the granting of subsidies, and the License guaranteed in Clause 20.2 that if the Licensees were not reimbursed within 15 days, they would be authorized to apply full tariff rates. As noted above, the subsidies are governed by the \"principle of indifference\" in the light of Article 48 of Decree No. 1738/92. The neutrality of subsidies is explained by Mr. Perkins as meaning that the \"financial burden of any subsidies was to be bome solely by the Government.\"34\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Philip Dexter Peacock of June 21, 2003, Cl. Exhibit 7B, para. 28.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Patricio Carlos Perkins of June 2, 2003, Exhibit 7A, para. 251.\n\n182.\n\nThe question left for the Tribunal to decide at this point is whether such subsidies were owed in AR pesos or U.S. dollars. The Claimant has argued that subsidies were an integral part of the tariff, and that as such they are due in U.S. dollars like the tariff itself. The Claimant\u2019s witness Mr. Albarracin has explained that the \"nature of the subsidy and the tariff are the same... The amounts are calculated in dollars expressed in pesos.\"35 Financial experts for the Claimant have also made the same point in respect of valuation because what matters in their view is the \"true value of the money at the moment the obligation was due.\"36\n\nTestimony of Mr. Santiago Albarracin, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 2, February 7, 2006, pp. 267-268; Claimant\u2019s Post Hearing brief of April 3, 2006, para. 19.\n\nExpert Statement of Mr. Manuel Abdala, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 5, February 10, 2006, p. 918; Claimant\u2019s Post Hearing brief of April 3, 2006, para. 85; LECG Supplemental Report of September 20, 2005, para. 102.\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent argues to the contrary that subsidies have always been established, billed and collected in pesos. Asked by the Tribunal how subsidies were in practice collected, witness for the Claimant Mr. Martin Juan Blaquier explained that \"the system produces a bill for the customer in pesos, and a sworn statement in pesos that is the first process that goes to ENARGAS.\"37 Another witness for the Claimant likewise expressed the view that at the time the Agreement was entered into, \"it was in pesos.\"38 This view was followed by various demands for clarification at the hearing, the answers to which were none too clear.39 More explicit yet was a witness for the Respondent, who explained that the subsidy is a result of a budget allocation which by law is set up in pesos, as the \"nature of the subsidy is to discount the amount to be paid by the end user... is already set up in pesos.\"40\n\nTestimony of Mr. Martin Juan Blaquier, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 7, February 13, 2006, pp. 1375-1376.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Santiago Albarracin, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 2, February 7, 2006, p. 250.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Santiago Albarracin, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 2, February 7, 2006, pp. 250-251,253-256.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Walter Kunz, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 3, February 8, 2006, pp. 507-508.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondent\u2019s argument that the subsidies were payable in Argentine pesos. To begin with, there is a question concerning the practical operation of the subsidy. Once the tariff was calculated in U.S. dollars at any given point in time, it was expressly provided that it would be converted into pesos for billing purposes. At that time, the tariff departed from its U.S. dollar denomination and became due in pesos. Billing was made in pesos, and sums owed were collected in pesos. The role of the subsidy is that the Government picks up a part of the bill and reimburses the distributor for that part, the other part being paid by the customer. It was never envisaged that the customer should pay the equivalent in U.S. dollars. Neither was it ever envisaged that the Government should do so for its part of the bill. If it were intended to be otherwise, it would have had to be expressly provided, which was certainly not the case.\n\n185.\n\nEven with the subsidies being payable in pesos, there was a clear obligation on the part of the Government to pay them on time. If this was not done within a period of fifteen days, as noted, the License allowed the Claimant to charge the customer the full tariff. This was the natural consequence of the principle of indifference noted above. The Subsidies Agreement made on December 12, 2001 was made in pesos,41 but it included payment of part of the subsidies owed in U.S. dollars and the option to accept U.S. dollar denominated government bonds since pegging was still in force at the time. Had the Government paid the subsidies when they were due, the value of such payment, even counted in pesos, would have been quite different from the value after devaluation. The Tribunal believes in the light of the License provisions that the Claimant cannot be made to bear the consequences of the Government\u2019s fall into arrears. The conclusion that follows is that the value of the pesos owed is necessarily to be established as that at December 2001.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Walter Kunz, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 3, February 8, 2006, p. 521.\n\n186.\n\nThe amount owed through October 31, 2001 was established in the Subsidies Agreement of December 12, 2001 (AR$108,151,277.73). Additional amounts for the months of November and December 2001 accrued later, which the Claimant puts at AR$17.3 million, a figure that the Tribunal will correct in view that it also covered the month of September 2001.\n\n187.\n\nWhile both parties have argued, for different purposes, that the Agreement was not ratified by the pertinent administrative act, the Tribunal can only conclude that such an agreement genuinely embodied a firm commitment of both parties. If no necessary follow-up was undertaken, this was most likely the result of the administrative nightmare into which the Government was plunged when the crisis erupted in full strength a few days later. In fact, a witness for the Claimant confirmed in answer to a question from the Tribunal that the Agreement had been signed by company representatives as well as by Ministers Cavallo and Bastos, who \"were Ministers at the time in Argentina.\"42 In answer to another question from the Tribunal, Counsel for the Respondent explained that the pertinent Executive Order of the President, which in the Respondent\u2019s view was the necessary administrative act of approval, was apparently not issued because \"we are talking about... 10 days before the President was overthrown, so... \"43\n\nTestimony of Mr. Martin Juan Blaquier, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 7, February 13, 2006, p. 1360.\n\nRemarks of Mr. Gabriel Bottini, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 7, February 13, 2006, pp. 1366-1367.\n\n188.\n\nIn the light of the principle of indifference explained above and the fact that Argentina recognized the amount of subsidies as owing before December 31, 2001, the Tribunal concludes that any amount owed for the period terminating on December 31, 2001, in spite that it might have been expressed in pesos, must be compensated at the parity exchange value which the peso had in December 2001 as otherwise the Claimant would be put at great disadvantage.\n\n*The fifth claim: Interference with the collection of bills and related matters*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. The Claimant\u2019s arguments*\n-----------------------------\n\n189.\n\nOn actions taken by the National Ombudsman, federal courts in Argentina issued preliminary measures directing the gas companies and other utilities to reschedule the date for payment of all bills due after December 31, 2001. This is a matter which the Claimant brings to this Tribunal. The Claimant similarly argues that other injunctions prevented the Licensees from interrupting service in case of non-payment of bills, and that these decisions, while later reversed, resulted nonetheless in the prevention of the companies\u2019 exercise of a right and led to what the Claimant believes was a judicial encouragement of default.\n\n190.\n\nOther complaints brought by the Claimant concern the ENARGAS policy of rejecting requests for suspension of service to sub-distributors in arrears, the imposition by law of employee severance restrictions that resulted in added costs, and the regulatory agency\u2019s refusal to allow the passing-through to tariffs of most or any costs associated with the purchase and transportation of natural gas or the payment of easements to surface owners.\n\n*2. The Respondent\u2019s arguments*\n-------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondent contends that none of these claims has any merit, as court measures rescheduling the due dates of bills were only one-time decisions, limited to a duration of 20 days that caused no damage and led the Supreme Court to reject the Licensees\u2019 complaints. Other court injunctions were equally exceptional, the Respondent maintains, as they were later reversed and in any event had arisen in the context of specific lawsuits concerning work stoppage that were soon settled.\n\n192.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts that the provisions of the Emergency Law prohibiting the lay-off of workers responded to the social and employment conditions produced by the crisis, and were upheld by the Supreme Court. While these measures are still in force, they have not impeded the severance of employees. They have only required the payment of additional compensation, which has been gradually reduced as employment conditions have improved.44 In the Respondent\u2019s view, pass-through costs can only be adjusted under the regulatory framework on the occasion of the periodic five-year tariff review, or else in the light of an extraordinary review, neither of which was the case with the Claimant\u2019s applications to ENARGAS. In any event, it is also explained that the economic balance of the licenses has not been altered by these costs. The Respondent additionally argues that the license clauses allowing for the passthrough of costs associated with the use of the public domain are not applicable to easements.\n\nDr. Graciela Vilas\u2019 First Legal Opinion, filed with Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 31-34.\n\n*3. The Tribunal\u2019s findings*\n----------------------------\n\n193.\n\nApart from factually explaining the measures taken concerning these matters and their circumstances, the parties have only briefly elaborated on the legal arguments and defenses supporting their respective positions. The Tribunal is nevertheless satisfied that some of the measures taken, such as the extension of the payment deadline or suspensions ordered in connection with a work stoppage, were applied for very limited periods of time, related to the circumstances of the moment, and do not entail demonstrable damages beyond or additional to the effects that the crisis had on the Licensees, which will be considered as a whole.\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied that the restrictions concerning the severance of employees apply to the economy as a whole and were not aimed at the Licensees in particular. As the Respondent has explained, these measures did not involve a prohibition on labor lay-offs, but only increased the pertinent compensation to be paid. This obligation has, moreover, been eased as conditions have improved. Here again, whatever the effects these measures had, they are part of the overall impact of the crisis on the business, which will also fall to be considered as a whole.\n\n195.\n\nIn accordance with the above, the Tribunal does not find merit in such peripheral claims, and will not consider these aspects separately from the Claimant\u2019s overall claim for compensation.\n\n196.\n\nQuestions concerning the passing through to tariffs of certain costs have also been raised in connection with easements. To the extent that there might be damages in connection with this claim, they are equally to be considered in the context of the overall claim for compensation and not as a separate item.\n\n*Damages claimed*\n-----------------\n\n197.\n\nAs a consequence of the measures described above, the Claimant alleges that damage was caused to two major areas of its business. It first argues that the Licensees were unable to secure international credit, and that in order to avoid default, the Claimant loaned the Licensees U.S.$56,017,000 by the end of 2001. The Claimant next argues that the Licensees were rendered unable to pay gas producers, and thus made vulnerable to numerous lawsuits for unpaid debt.\n\n198.\n\nIn its closing statement, the Claimant explains that, including damage to equity value and debt, unpaid subsidies and historical PPI damage, its share of the damages suffered amounts to U.S.$209.3 million. The precise amounts will be considered in the section on Remedies.\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimant\u2019s estimates, arguing first that the price originally paid for CGS and CGP was lower than that claimed in the present case, particularly because part of this price was paid in government debt instruments that were valued higher than the market price. The Respondent further contends that the loans made to the Licensees in late 2001 responded to their financial policies, and that the risks which they took cannot be attributed to the Government. Neither, in the Respondent\u2019s view, can the decision of the Licensees to take debt abroad in dollars or other currencies be so attributed, given that the Government is not a financial insurer. The Tribunal accepted the Respondent\u2019s request for the Claimant to produce a number of financial statements and documents on which its claim is based.\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondent additionally objected to the expert valuation of the Licensees produced by the Claimant, and requested further information on cash flows. The Respondent also for its part produced expert reports concluding that the Licensees had obtained a reasonable return on their capital, which under one \"project finance\" methodology is estimated at US$120,000,000 as of 2005. The Respondent particularly objects to the Claimant\u2019s argument that there is a principle of international law requiring full compensation to be paid. In the Respondent\u2019s view, if any valuation is to be required, this must be done in terms of the stock\u2019s value. The Claimant considers this method inappropriate, however, since CGS is not traded on any stock market, and since CGP\u2019s very limited stock trading is extremely illiquid and any large sale of its shares would substantially affect the market price.\n\n201.\n\nThe parties\u2019 discussion of the relevant aspects of the technical reports and conclusions will be considered further below in the context of valuation.\n\n*Regulatory and financial issues and defenses*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nIn addition to the parties\u2019 specific arguments in respect of each of the claims explained above, they have also discussed a number of important questions touching on economic and financial matters that are closely related to the regulatory framework governing the investment. These issues and defenses will be examined next, without prejudice to the pertinent items that will be discussed in connection with valuation issues further below.\n\n*1. The valuation date*\n-----------------------\n\n203.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Claimant had significantly increased its investment in CGS and CGP in October 2000, after the PPI adjustment injunction had been issued, the Tribunal raised at the hearing on the merits the question of the date which the Claimant was asserting as the relevant one in respect of the alleged expropriation acts. If this date was the day prior to the PPI injunction in August 2000, *i.e.,* August 17, 2000, it raised questions about why the company had decided to increase its investment shortly afterwards, and how this increase should be treated for the purpose of valuation. If, on the other hand, the date was one prior to the enactment of the Emergency Law in January 2002, it raised a different question, namely about whether the injunction was in fact considered an act of expropriation.\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimant has clarified that it is requesting that the expropriation date be set at December 31, 2001, a few days before the enactment of the Emergency Law. This is because that measure was the one which gave rise to the central claim in this arbitration.45 In Professor Reisman\u2019s view, this choice by the Claimant is entitled to some deference,46 and the Claimant further argues that such deference was paid by the Tribunal in *CMS.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-hearing Brief, para. 90.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor W. Michael Reisman, Elearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006, p.1055; see also Opinion of Professor W. Michael Reisman of July 25, 2003, paras 146-157.\n\n205.\n\nA witness for the Claimant also stated at the hearing on the merits that the decision to increase the investment in October 2000 was explained by the view at the time that there was no indication on the part of the Government that the investor\u2019s rights could be affected, and also by the fact that both the Government and ENARGAS had appealed the injunction.47 Professor Reisman has likewise explained that the injunction could be regarded as a first small step that only with the benefit of hindsight could be seen as an indirect expropriation ultimately leading to the Emergency Law.48\n\nTestimony of Mr. George Michael Morgan, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 1, February 6, 2006, pp. 203-205.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor W. Michael Reisman, Elearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006, pp.1054-1055.\n\n206.\n\nThe Claimant concludes on this basis that the injunction was at first considered a temporary deferral that would be fully compensated in the short-term. The Claimant also contends that even if the Tribunal were to choose August 17, 2000 as the valuation date, this should not affect the treatment of the investment done in October 2000 because, for the reasons already explained, there was no expectation at the time that the suspension would lead to a deprivation of rights and failure of compensation.\n\n207.\n\nThe Respondent has noted the Claimant\u2019s apparent contradiction in alleging expropriation with respect to the injunction of August 2000 and yet increasing the investment a few weeks later. The Respondent has, however, quite naturally not offered a valuation date in this context because in its view there has been no expropriation and no compensation is due.\n\n208.\n\nOne can be puzzled by the fact that an experienced investor would have taken a decision to increase its equity participation at a time when trouble was around the comer. This decision in fact prompted questions and explanations before the investor\u2019s governing board.49 Yet, considering the fact that both the Government and ENARGAS were fully supporting the rights of the Licensees, as became apparent in the appeals brief when it explained in detail the rights the Licensees had under the regulatory framework and the License, the explanation given by the Claimant is plausible. While the events at the time could give rise to concern, the real warning signals had not yet appeared, and both the Government and the Licensees were confident that the situation could be managed.\n\nTestimony of Mr. George Michael Morgan, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 1, February 6, 2006, pp. 204-205.\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal will accordingly use December 31, 2001 as the proper valuation date. This is not because it believes that the Claimant\u2019s argument should be given any deference, but simply because the explanation given shows that there was an investment decision made in good faith. Neither does the Tribunal share the interpretation which the Claimant has given to **CMS** with regard to the payment of certain deference in the choice of a valuation date. It is apparent that in **CMS** no acts or decisions taken by the claimant after the injunction raised any doubt about the date which triggered the events complained of.\n\n210.\n\nThe determination of the Tribunal as to the valuation date has two implications for the Claimant\u2019s pleas, one being positive and the other negative. The positive implication is that the investment made in October 2000 must be treated as part of the protected equity affected by the complained-of measures as from the valuation date. The negative implication for such pleas is that it raises questions about the situation of the inter-company loans made in December 2001. This last matter will be discussed next.\n\n*2. The inter-company loans*\n----------------------------\n\n211.\n\nIt has been noted above that the Claimant is arguing that the investment includes a loan for US$56 million that it made to CGS and CGP in December 2001, for which the Claimant should also be compensated. The Respondent believes that this loan responded to financial decisions made by the Claimant that are not to be attributed to anyone else, and for which the Government is not responsible.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal must first take into consideration the context in which this loan was made. The Licensees had first obtained international financing by issuing Commercial Paper for six months. This was followed by a Floating Rate Note due in December 1996. When the Note became due, CGS and CGP issued negotiable instruments (\"Obligaciones Negociables\") under a Medium-Term Note Program that came due in December 2001. The Claimant explains that these instruments were not convertible into shares.\n\n213.\n\nWhen the Licensees attempted to secure financing in order to cancel the notes due in December 2001, they found that it was no longer possible to do so because, as witness Mr. Blaquier explains, \"[a]t that time, financial markets were for all purposes closed to Argentine companies.\"50 In order to avoid default, the Claimant made the presently discussed loan as it was felt that, from the investor\u2019s point of view, \"a default from the Licensees on their bonds would have resulted in a severe negative impact on shareholders\u2019 values and, therefore, the decision to lend was a reasonable financial decision.\"51\n\nSupplemental Witness Statement of Mr. Martin Juan Blaquier, filed with Claimant\u2019s Reply Memorial, para. 7.\n\nSupplemental Witness Statement of Mr. George Michael Morgan, filed with Claimants\u2019 Reply Memorial, para. 14.\n\n214.\n\nUnder the broad definition of investment contained in the Treaty, loans are generally to be considered as a protected investment. The Tribunal has carefully considered whether in the light of the *Joy Mining* case,52 in which a distinction was drawn between a purely commercial operation and an investment, there could here be a situation in which the loans might, as argued by the Respondent, be considered a commercial operation not different from those normally made by financial institutions, and which would result in the loans not qualifying as a part of the investment. Despite the fact that the commercial papers, notes, bonds and negotiable instruments, as the instruments have been variously described, are not different from any other issuance of obligations, they were still made by a qualifying investor as a substitute for financial obligations previously undertaken in the context of the financing of the same investment. Such loans were in fact part of the investment\u2019s continuing financing arrangements, and were interposed at a moment when only the investor was available to make them.\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11), Award of August 6, 2004.\n\n215.\n\nWhile a witness for the Claimant described this operation as one in which \"[t]he only contribution that the partners made was an amount to pay the bond that was to mature,\"53 it was a normal business move by the investor in a situation where additional financing was necessary to keep a company out of default. To the extent that the loans were made in connection with a legitimate business purpose, as they in fact were, there is no reason to exclude them from the protected investment.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Martin Juan Blaquier, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 7, February 13, 2006, p. 1362.\n\n216.\n\nWhile the question of the reasonableness of leverage has been discussed at various points in the pleadings, including with respect to the loans made to the Licensees, the issue does not appear to be any different in the presently discussed context. As noted above, the loans were made in substitution for an investment financing scheme that had been ongoing from the beginning, and which had not met with any objection from the regulatory authority. The Tribunal sees no reason why they should not now be considered equally reasonable.\n\n*3. Regulated and non-regulated business*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe parties have also discussed whether the existence of a non-regulated sector of the Licensees\u2019 business that was particularly involved in the production and marketing of LPG, ethane and raw gasoline should have any influence on the valuation of the companies, and also on the discussion about whether they benefited from devaluation in view of the improved results of this side of the business.\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that the two sides of the business are entirely separate both legally and financially. This has been the consistent understanding of the Respondent and its regulatory bodies from the outset. The bad results in one area of the business cannot be set off against the good results in the other. Avoidance of crosssubsidization is the right economic principle applied by many companies that have various sectors of activity within their overall business. The success of the non-regulated business should not subsidize the losses of the regulated business, and this is to be the criterion that shall guide the eventual determination of compensation. Furthermore, any such determination shall relate only to the measures adopted in respect of the regulated sector of the business.\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the regulated and non-regulated sectors of CGS and CGP are to be kept separate and independent for the purposes of this claim.\n\n*4. The issue of renegotiations*\n--------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nThe Emergency Law directed the Government to begin a renegotiation process for public utility contracts affected by the measures indicated. While the rights of licensees were expressly safeguarded under the arrangements originally set up for the process, the Government gradually conditioned the right to participate on the abandonment of all claims before local courts or arbitral tribunals. Various bodies in charge of renegotiation have been set up over time, and the deadlines have been regularly extended, with the last extension bringing the deadline to the end of 2007.\n\n221.\n\nThe renegotiation process has not made much progress in the gas transportation and distribution industry as a whole, but it has advanced in respect of some contracts. One such contract was entered into with a gas provider and was finalized in July 2005 but is still pending legislative and executive approval (i.e., GASBAN).54 As noted above, two other agreements signed in 2007 involve the Licensees in this claim, although as it will be explained the investor concerned in this claim has challenged the process followed.55 The process of renegotiation has also been successfully completed in connection with the contracts of gas producers and in some other sectors of the economy.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Jorge Gustavo Simeonoff, filed with Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para.64.\n\nActa Acuerdo Adecuaci\u00f3n del Contrato de Licencia de Distribuci\u00f3n de Gas Natural between the Argentine Republic and CGS and CGP, respectively, of April 26, 2007 (Cited as Agreements, Memorandums of Understanding or MOU).\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimant explains in this respect that the failure of the renegotiation process as far as its interests are concerned is due partly to the fact that the tariff adjustment proposed by the Government has been well below the minimum required by the industry, and partly to the fact that none of the rights existing under the License would be reestablished and no compensation would be paid for the losses incurred thus far. The Claimant further asserts that it is required to withdraw its legal actions and make the Government whole for any adverse decision.\n\n223.\n\nThe Government for its part maintains that the renegotiation process is gradually advancing, and that out of 64 contracts subject to renegotiation, 37 agreements have been successfully completed, including those noted in the gas transportation sector.56 It is further asserted that international claims have been an obstacle to the more expedient progress of negotiation. According to the Respondent, CGS also participates in various expansion projects, all of which result in benefits to the company.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Jorge Gustavo Simeonoff, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 2, February 7, 2006, pp. 279-282, and Witness Statement of Mr. Jorge Gustavo Simeonoff, filed with Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 64 and 127.\n\n224.\n\nAs indicated above, the Respondent signed Memoranda of Understanding on April 26, 2007 with both Licensees concerned in this case, CGS and CGP. Under these agreements a 25% tariff adjustment will take place as from January 1, 2008 for one company and from July 1, 2007 for the other. Neither shall exceed an average tariff increase of 15%. In addition, a 2% increase shall be allocated to infrastructure improvement. The agreements also envisage the suspension and discontinuance of judicial or arbitral claims.\n\n225.\n\nOn the basis of this development, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal on June 29, 2007 putting forth the view that the agreements made the claim in this case inadmissible as the Licensees had accepted a new tariff regime and the investor did not have any separate claim of its own. This view was opposed by the Claimant on the argument that it had not accepted the agreements in question and that these bound only Camuzzi, the claimant in a separate proceeding which was also an indirect investor in CGS and CGP. The Claimant also explained that it had initiated legal proceedings against Camuzzi in Argentina for breach of a shareholders agreement.\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal shall not pass judgment on the features of a renegotiation between the Licensees and the Government of Argentina, least between the shareholders, but it is bound to take note that the Licensees agreed to new contractual terms with the Government and that these cover the period running from January 6, 2002 until the end of the License. The Tribunal must also take note of the fact that the Claimant in this case has expressly disavowed its acceptance of the agreements. The issue for the Tribunal is then to decide whether the Claimant is bound by the agreements to which a separate investor has consented. Whether this consent was given in accordance with corporate arrangements and required majorities is something to be decided by the Argentine courts. Yet, the Tribunal must take into consideration the effect of such agreements on the Claimant\u2019s interests in the Licensees.\n\n227.\n\nAfter considering this matter and the arguments of the parties, the Tribunal has reached two conclusions. The first is that as the Claimant is still an investor whose interests are protected by the Treaty, it cannot be bound by an agreement between different entities to the extent that those interests have not been adequately satisfied. The agreements are to this effect *res inter alios acta.* The agreements envisage that corporate majorities involving both majority and minority shareholders are necessary to express the required consent. The interests of the Claimant in its investment in the Licensees are still affected by the measures complained of and it is to be regarded as entitled to pursue his grievances in this arbitration. Consequently, there is no ground to justify a decision of inadmissibility of the claim in this context.\n\n228.\n\nThe second conclusion is that, in spite of the above holding, the agreements do have consequences for the Claimant in view of the fact that there are objective outcomes that benefit the Licensees to an extent. The first concerns the question of double dipping, in that the agreements envisage an obligation for the parties to them to keep the Respondent free from any adverse implications of compensation that could be obtained by the Claimant in an arbitral or other forum. The second consequence is that objectively the agreements will improve the business of the Licensees and to that extent the Claimant will also benefit as a shareholder. Both consequences will be examined separately, one in the context of the argument of double dipping and the other in the context of valuation.\n\n*5. The Trust Fund*\n-------------------\n\n229.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that both the Claimant\u2019s participation in the \"Agreement for the Expansion of the Andean Line,\"57 to which CGS is a party, and the related establishment of a Trust Fund to expand the gas transportation and distribution system, are further evidence that tariffs are being adjusted to the benefit of the Licensees\u2019 operations and business. A separate Trust Fund Agreement concerning the expansion of distribution systems and carriage capacity in Tierra del Fuego has also been described as particularly benefiting CGS.58 The Claimant opposes these assertions.\n\nConvenio entre la Unidad de renegociaci\u00f3n y an\u00e1lisis de contratos de servicios p\u00fablicos, la Empresa Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. y la empresa Camuzzi Gas del Sur S.A., para la ampliaci\u00f3n del sistema del gasoducto cordillerano of February 27, 2004, Annex RA 169.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Cristian Folgar, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 3, February 8, 2006, pp. 581-582.\n\n230.\n\nAgain, this is not a matter for the Tribunal to consider. Agreements between the parties about matters not involving the Licenses cannot be interpreted as changing any rights or obligations established under the Licenses. At most, such agreements offer insights into the organization of certain aspects of the business after the emergency.\n\n*The law applicable to a finding of liability*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe parties have disagreed about the law applicable to this dispute under Article 42(1) of the Convention. This article provides that the Tribunal *\"shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable. \"*\n\n232.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the parties have chosen the Treaty as the *lex specialis* applicable in this case under the first sentence of this Article. Other rules of international law not inconsistent with the Treaty are, according to the Claimant, likewise applicable in the light of the second sentence of the same Article. These include rules on the interpretation of treaties and customary rules that provide for a minimum standard of treatment for covered investments. The Claimant asserts, moreover, that domestic law is relevant only in the context of factual matters, such as the nature of the assurances made to the investor. In the opinion of a legal expert introduced by the Claimant, such assurances acquired international legal force by virtue of the Treaty, and therefore to \"regard Argentine law rather than the *lex specialis* of the BITs... would be to eviscerate the fundamental objectives of the States parties to the BITs.\"59\n\nExpert Opinion of Professor W. Michael Reisman of July 25, 2003, pars 59, 60.\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondent for its part believes that Article 42 has an entirely different meaning. In the Respondent\u2019s view, domestic law is not confined in scope of application to factual matters, but also has a substantive role in defining the rights of the investor, particularly where property rights are involved in the dispute. These rights are allegedly not defined by international law, but by the local law to which the investor has voluntarily submitted. In support of this view, the Respondent invokes in particular Clause 18.3 of Annex 1 of the Licenses, which provides that \"[e]ach and every provision of this License shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law.\"60 It is maintained that this law is contained in the Constitution, the Gas Law, the Gas Decree and the License itself. The Respondent also argues that when parties have agreed on a forum-selection clause giving jurisdiction to a domestic court, this choice cannot later be ignored by an international tribunal.\n\nExecutive Order 2255/92, Exhibit \"B\", Distribution License, Subexhibit I, Basic Rules.\n\n234.\n\nThe Respondent further explains that this approach does not exclude the application of either the Treaty, for example in defining which investors are covered under its provisions, or general international law, which provides for rules on the treatment of investments. In any event, the Respondent asserts that any finding of international responsibility would require the Claimant to prove that a specific breach of the Treaty has taken place, and that this has not been done in the present case.\n\n235.\n\nThe parties\u2019 discussion concerning Article 42(1) of the Convention appears to be theoretical to some extent since this Article provides for a variety of sources to play simultaneous roles. Indeed, the Respondent is right to argue that domestic law is not confined in scope of application to the determination of factual questions. It indeed has a broader role, as is evident from the pleadings and arguments of the parties to this very case. The License is itself governed by the legal order of the Argentine Republic, and it must be interpreted in its light.61\n\nLicense, Clause 16.1 on governing law.\n\n236.\n\nSo too, the Claimant is right in arguing for the prominent role of international law. In fact, the Treaty, international conventions and customary law have been invoked by the parties in respect of a number of matters. While writers and decisions have on occasion tended to consider domestic law and international law as mutually incompatible in their application, this is far from actually being the case. Both have a role to perform in the resolution of the dispute, as has been recognized.62\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt, Ad Hoc* Committee Decision on Application for Annulment of February 5, 2002, 41 *ILM* 933 (2002), at 941; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. the Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of May 12, 2005.\n\n237.\n\nThe legal order of the Argentine Republic, in keeping with those of many other modem States, provides for a prominent role to be played by international law under both Articles 27 and 31 of the Constitution. Treaties are recognized as \"the supreme law of the Nation.\" It follows that in case of a conflict between a rule of domestic law and a rule embodied in a treaty, it is international law that will prevail. This is also the solution provided by Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which establishes that a State \"may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.\"\n\n238.\n\nIn examining the Claimant\u2019s allegation that Argentina has incurred a liability in consequence of its adopted measures, and the Respondent\u2019s defense that no such consequence arises under the law, the Tribunal finds that there is generally no inconsistency between the Argentine law and international law insofar as the basic principles governing the matter are concerned. Problems arise only in respect of some specific issues that will be noted in due course. To the extent that there is any inconsistency between Argentine law and the treaties in force, however, international law will prevail, as is established under both the Argentine Constitution and Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n239.\n\nThe parties have given particular attention in their arguments to the meaning in this context of the *Tecmed* decision.63 The Claimant believes that this award reached the right conclusion, namely that an \"Act of State must be characterized as internationally wrongful if it constitutes a breach of an international obligation, even if the act does not contravene the State\u2019s internal law...\" The Respondent, however, distinguishes that case because under the relevant investment promotion treaty, unlike the Treaty applicable to this case, domestic law has a different role, and also because the *Tecmed,* tribunal considered the relevant Mexican law to determine whether the treatment required had actually been afforded. The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent is right in asserting that the *Tecmed* award relates to an entirely different legal context, and that it does not provide helpful guidance in respect of the present dispute.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States,* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award of May 29, 2003.\n\n240.\n\nIn accordance with the above considerations, the Tribunal will consider both Argentine law and international law to the extent each is relevant to a determination on liability.\n\n*The stability of the License under the Argentine Constitution and contract law*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded above that various rights which the Claimant held under the License have ceased to be observed as a result of the measures complained of. It is now necessary to examine the Argentine law governing contracts in order to determine whether liability exists under the domestic legal order. The Respondent has in this context again raised the objection that to the extent they exist, such rights belong to CGS and CGP as the Licensees, and not to the Claimant. The Tribunal has already decided this question in the Decision on Jurisdiction, however, and shall not discuss it again here.\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined above the aspects of the parties\u2019 discussion dealing with the constitutional implications of a right to calculate tariffs in U.S. dollars, and has concluded that there is no inconsistency between such a right and the provisions of the Constitution. The basic principles enshrined by the Argentine Constitution are also pertinent to the discussion on liability. Indeed, Article 17 of the Constitution establishes the basic principle that the \"right to property is inviolable and that no inhabitant of the Nation can be deprived of it except by a judicial decision founded in the law.\" The Constitution further provides at Article 28 that \"the principles, guarantees, and rights recognized in the preceding articles shall not be altered by the laws regulating their exercise.\" Consistent with these provisions, Article 1197 of the Civil Code mandates that contractual rules must be observed as the law between the parties. The stability of rights and contracts is thus clearly a central feature of the applicable domestic law.\n\n243.\n\nThis is not to say that contractual obligations must never be changed, irrespective of the circumstances. Article 1198 of the Civil Code addresses cases in which extraordinary and unforeseeable events can allow a party to a contract to request its termination for having become excessively onerous. It thereby recognizes the theory of \"imprevisi\u00f3n\" and the seeking of a rebalancing of contractual benefits. *Force majeure* and unjust enrichment are additional mechanisms that allow for the renegotiation and rebalancing of contractual obligations.\n\n244.\n\nThe Tribunal observes in this context that the award of the Tribunal in *CMS* identified the *Gaz de Bordeaux* decision as the source of the theory of \"imprevisi\u00f3n\" in administrative law,64 as an expression of the common understanding about general principles of law that are found in most legal systems, particularly those of the civil law tradition.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. the Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case N. ARB/01/8, Award of May 12, 2005, para. 224.\n\n245.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s legal experts have concluded in this case that, as a result of the aforementioned jurisprudential developments, the theory of \"imprevisi\u00f3n\" has been incorporated into Argentine law.65 A legal expert for the Claimant reaches the same conclusion, with the understanding that the theory was accepted in Argentine jurisprudence even before *Gaz de Bordeaux66*\n\nLegal Opinion of Mr. Gabriel Bouzat and Mr. Carlos F. Rosenkrantz, Second Legal Opinion filed with Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial, paras. 131-132.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor H\u00e9ctor A. Mairal, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 4, February 9, 2006, p. 699.\n\n246.\n\nIt must further be kept in mind that, insofar as the theory of \"imprevisi\u00f3n\" is expressed in the concept of *force majeure,* this other concept requires, under Article 23 of the Articles on State Responsibility, that the situation involve the occurrence of an irresistible force, beyond the control of the State, making it materially impossible under the circumstances to perform the obligation. In the commentary to this article, it is stated that \"[/]orce *majeure* does not include circumstances in which performance of an obligation has become more difficult, for example due to some political or economic crisis\"67.\n\nJames Crawford, *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries,* (ed., Cambridge University Press) (2002), p. 171.\n\n*Emergency as a defense under Argentine jurisprudence*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Respondent has relied significantly on the argument that, under Argentine law, a state of emergency justifies the legal standing of the measures adopted. The Respondent\u2019s view allegedly finds support in the various aforementioned legal concepts allowing for the rebalancing of contracts. The courts of Argentina have on various occasions addressed recurring emergency situations, declared by Congress, by conditioning their legal recognition on very precise terms.68 This jurisprudential definition acquires particular significance in the light of the fact that, as explained by the legal expert Professor Mairal, the Argentine Constitution does not \"expand the powers of Congress in the case of emergencies.\"69 The Argentine Supreme Court has for its part held in connection with the Emergency Law presently in force that\n\n\"it is not useless to remind, as the Tribunal has done for long, that restrictions imposed by the State on the normal exercise of patrimonial rights must be reasonable, limited in time, and constitute a remedy and not a mutation in the substance or essence of the right acquired by judicial decision or contract... \"70\n\nSee the jurisprudence cited in *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. the Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of May 12, 2005, footnote 91.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Professor H\u00e9ctor H\u00e9ctor A. Mairal of September 14, 2005, Cl. Exh 188, para. 63.\n\nArgentine Supreme Court, Judgment in the case *\"Provincia de San Luis c. P. E. N. -Ley 25561, Dto. 1570/01 y 214/02 s/amparo) \",* March 5, 2003.\n\n248.\n\nIt is against this background that the Tribunal must examine the effects of the emergency measures enacted in 2002 on the obligations and commitments defined in the License. The License is of course not an ordinary contract since it involves the operation of a public service under the regulatory authority of the State. Even in this context, however, the licensees enjoy specific rights which are subject to protection under the Constitution, relevant law and the provisions of the contract. As noted above, however strong the regulatory powers of the State might be, they are yet governed by the law and the State\u2019s obligation to protect the rights acquired by individuals.\n\n*1. First requirement: Temporality*\n-----------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal can well understand the need to adopt emergency measures in the midst of the major crisis that has been noted. Yet, invocation of an \"emergency\" is not enough *per se* to exempt these measures from liability in the light of the applicable law. A first question that must be examined in this respect is whether the measures adopted are temporal or permanent in nature. This is a matter on which the parties\u2019 views differ. The Respondent has repeatedly emphasized both the temporal nature of the emergency measures and the fact that the Emergency Law expires on a precise date. This ending date has been extended, it is argued, so as to ensure the orderly settlement of complex, outstanding problems. The fact is, however, that the expiry date has been extended year after year, so that the Emergency Law is presently scheduled to end on December 31, 2007. This is the situation that has given rise to the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Emergency Law has in reality been turned into a permanent feature of the Argentine economy.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this to be a rather disquieting situation because in actual fact the crisis is largely over, even if aftershocks might quite naturally still be felt for some time. Experts and tribunals have considered different dates as the ending point of the crisis, ranging from mid-200371 to the end of 2004 or even early 2005.72 A witness for the Respondent states that while the economy started to recover in 2003, \"it is only in 2004 when we see a very important recovery,\"73 including an increasing flow of foreign direct investment comparable in level to that of the 1990\u2019s.74\n\nExpert Statement of Professor Sebastian Edwards, Elearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006, p. 1160.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. the Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), award of May 12, 2005.\n\nExpert Statement of Mr. Daniel Chudnovsky, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 4, February 9, 2006, p. 771.\n\nExpert Report of Mr. Daniel Chudnovsky, filed with Respondent Rejoinder, para. 34.\n\n251.\n\nIn any event, it is not presently disputed that the crisis is over, and the strong performance of the Argentine economy evidences this conclusion unequivocally. In point of fact, the Argentine Gross Domestic Product grew 35.5% in the period 2003-2006, with an average growth of 8.8%.75 The continued extension of the emergency legislation would thus not seem to be quite justified by the facts.\n\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, *Statistics Yearbook of Latin America and the Caribbean 2006,* Economic Statistics, Table 2.1.1.1; see also Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 338\n\n252.\n\nThe requirement of temporality is also not met by the Respondent\u2019s policy not to allow for PPI adjustments or the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars, on the ground that there is still an ongoing crisis. When questioned about these issues at the hearing, a witness for the Respondent replied that the answer to PPI adjustment was \"no,\" and that the one to the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars was likewise \"[n]o. The tariffs resulting from the renegotiation process are in pesos.\"76\n\nTestimony of Mr. Jorge Gustavo Simeonoff, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 2, February 7, 2006, p. 335.\n\n2. *Second requirement: No essential mutation of rights*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nA second requirement which the courts have imposed for the establishment of the emergency measures\u2019 legal validity is that the restrictions imposed must provide a remedy while not also resulting in the mutation of the substance or essence of the rights acquired under a contract. Counsel for the Respondent, however, has advanced an interpretation that appears to be inconsistent with this requirement, namely that the Emergency Law meant \"basically the granting of a death certificate\" for the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars, as the Argentine currency had already been devalued in international markets.77 So too, a witness for the Respondent stated at the hearing that the Government made the \"great mistake... to keep the Convertibility Law in effect as a long-term plan since it should have been a short-term resource to solve a specific problem; namely, serious hyperinflation, serious problems in the eighties and nineties.\"78\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Statement, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 8, February 14, 2006, p. 1497; see also Testimony of Mr. Jorge Gustavo Simeonoff, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 2, February 7, 2006, pp. 335-336; Claimant\u2019s Post Hearing brief of April 3, 2006, para. 14.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Eduardo Ratti, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 3, February 8, 2006, pp. 490-491.\n\n254.\n\nThe decision to do away with this policy, while within the prerogative of the Government, means in reality that the rights granted under the License shall be permanently eliminated, at least insofar as the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars and their PPI adjustment are concerned. Licensees might of course accept the terms of a new tariff regime in the context of a renegotiated contract. In such a case, the mutation would be validated by the agreement of the parties. The natural outcome of the operation of \"emergency\" is not, however, a legal exemption from liability.\n\n*3. Third requirement: Reasonableness*\n--------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nA third requirement the courts have indicated is that restrictions imposed under the emergency must be reasonable. The discussion concerning the tariff regime which the Tribunal has outlined above reveals profound disagreement between the parties as to what is to be regarded as a just and reasonable tariff. While the Claimant believes that a tariff frozen for nearly seven years and kept unadjusted for nine years cannot in any way be considered reasonable, the Respondent contends that this was the only measure possible in the context of crisis and deflation, and that it is thus eminently reasonable.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal can only note in this respect that both the Government and the licensees of public services have repeatedly indicated that there is an inescapable need to attend to tariff adjustments and thereby ensure both the continued operation of the companies and the necessary supply of energy and other services. The very emphasis which the Respondent has placed on the question of renegotiation and the Agreements reached with the Licensees as to certain tariff adjustments are further evidence of this recognition. It follows that the prolongation of emergency measures for such a long period without the reestablishment or rebalancing of the License\u2019s benefits cannot be regarded as satisfying the legal requirement of reasonableness.\n\n*4. Unilateral determinations and adjustment by consent*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThere is still one other aspect of the matter that does not help the Respondent\u2019s argument about the consistency of the emergency measures with the domestic legal order. If changes indeed become necessary, they cannot be unilaterally adopted by the Government or its regulators, however competent they may be. This conclusion is supported by the view of a witness for the Respondent, who testified that because the crisis did not entail a merely circumstantial alteration of costs, but rather profound implications for contracts and licenses, \"a negotiation between the State and the concessionaires, not just the mere intervention of regulatory entities, was justified by the crisis\"79.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Eduardo Ratti, filed with Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial, Spanish version, para. 31.\n\n258.\n\nThe decision to adjust contracts has either to be taken jointly by the parties, as in a successful renegotiation, or requested from a judge, as is provided for in Article 1198 of the Civil Code. In any event, this decision is subject to judicial control even when the relevant regulatory authority is entailed in a license. It so happens, however, that the domestic judicial control of the emergency decisions has been mostly adverse to the Respondent\u2019s claimed justification, as in the *Provincia de San Luis* case noted above.\n\n259.\n\nIt must also be noted that the licenses have carefully provided for a detailed adjustment mechanism so that tariffs are revised periodically in order to take into account the true conditions of the industry. This shows that the question of an eventual rebalancing of benefits was not ignored. The semi-annual PPI adjustment, an efficiency-related adjustment following the first quinquennial review, and an investment-related adjustment likewise applicable after this review were some of the mechanisms envisaged to reflect the changes in the value of goods and services for the operator. The five-year review was another such mechanism, as was the possibility, provided for by the License, of an extraordinary review to correct tariffs considered to be inadequate, discriminatory or preferential. This review could be initiated either by ENARGAS or the licensees.\n\n260.\n\nAll such mechanisms could equally have resulted in either an increase or reduction in tariffs. The interests of consumers could also have been addressed and protected by these mechanisms, particularly if the tariffs became unrealistic and excessive in the context of a changed economic environment. Such changes would also have met the Government\u2019s obligation under the License not to amend the License without the agreement of the licensees. Yet, the Government chose not to use the alternatives provided under the License, and resorted instead to the unilateral determination reached under the emergency measures. The 2007 Agreements reached by the Government with the Licensees in part seeks to correct this imbalance.\n\n261.\n\nEven assuming that the implementation of any such mechanism would have taken some time, and that the Government needed to react quickly in confronting an emergency situation, which is a perfectly understandable concern, such measures could have been undertaken pursuant to a limited time schedule while reviews were carried out. It is the Government\u2019s unilateral determination, taken outside the appropriate regulatory system, and not the License corrections required, which resulted ultimately in the inconsistency of the measures taken with the domestic legal order.\n\n*The stability of licenses under Argentine administrative law*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe Respondent has correctly argued that a situation involving the regulatory powers of the State and licenses concerning public services cannot be examined only from the point of view of private contracts, but also requires that principles arising from Argentine administrative law and jurisprudence be taken into consideration. This the Tribunal will examine next.\n\n263.\n\nOn the basis of Articles 14 and 17 of the Constitution, the Argentine Supreme Court has broadly interpreted the meaning of the right to property, so that \"every right that has a value recognized as such under the law, whether it originates in private law relations or is bom from administrative acts (subjective rights of public or private nature), is comprised within the constitutional concept of property, on the condition that the holder of this right to property has a right of action against anyone attempting to interfere with its use, even if it is the State itself.\"80\n\n*Bustos, Alberto Roque y otros c/ Estado Nacional y otros s/ amparo,* Corte Suprema de Justicia de la Naci\u00f3n, October 26, 2004.\n\n264.\n\nWhile it is true that such rights are not absolute, and that in certain circumstances they must yield to the public interest, it is nevertheless true that in such a case the State is obliged to compensate the owner affected or limited in the exercise of its right. This is the very principle embodied in Article 2511 of the Civil Code in respect of expropriation.\n\n265.\n\nThe opinions of learned authors equally impose very specific conditions on the operation of the doctrine of the \"fait du prince\" that is applicable to administrative acts which would alter the contractual relationship to the detriment of the other party. Among such conditions is the requirement that an administrative act be of a general nature and attributable to the public authority, that it would alter the economic balance of the contract, and that it was unforeseeable at the time of the contract\u2019s execution. All of these lead to a right to compensation for the affected party.\n\n266.\n\nAs the expert report of Professor Mairal concludes in this matter, the measures presently in question were adopted by the Respondent\u2019s Government, while the Respondent was also a party to the contract with the licensees, and were unforeseeable at the time the Licenses were approved. There is also a direct causal relationship between the act and the damage suffered by the other party, all of it fundamentally altering the economic equation of the contract and thereby leading to the inescapable conclusion that compensation must be paid.81\n\nExpert Statement of Professor H\u00e9ctor A. Mairal, filed with Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the merit, p. 46.\n\n267.\n\nThe same conclusion is reached by Professor Mairal when examining the attribution of liability in the light of acts that breach the principle of equality in public obligations established under Article 16 of the Argentine Constitution, which would not permit a situation in which the licensees bore the entire cost of measures directed at preventing the sudden increase in gas tariffs.82\n\nExpert Statement of Professor El\u00e9ctor A. Mairal, filed with Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the merit, p. 47.\n\n*Liability under Argentine law*\n-------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s inescapable conclusion is that in considering the claims solely from the point of view of the Argentine legislation as the law applicable to the dispute, the obligations and commitments which the Argentine Republic owed in relation to the License were not observed. Whether the question is examined from the point of view of the Constitution, the Civil Code or Argentine administrative law, the conclusion is no different. Liability is the consequence of such a breach, and there is no legal excuse under the legislation that could justify the Government\u2019s non-compliance since the very conditions set out by the legislation and the decisions of courts have not been met. As will be examined further below, these conclusions are no different from those that could be reached under the Treaty and international law.\n\n269.\n\nAll the same, the Tribunal bears in mind that there was indeed a major crisis. While these unfortunate events do not in themselves amount to a legal excuse, neither would it be reasonable for the Claimant to believe it remains wholly unaffected by them. The economic balance of the License was clearly affected by the crisis, and just as it is unreasonable for the licensees to bear the entire burden of such a changed reality, neither would it be reasonable for them to believe that nothing has happened in Argentina since the License was approved. This is a point which the Tribunal will duly take into account when considering the compensation that follows upon this finding of liability and how the crisis period shall influence its determination.\n\n*The discussion of liability under the Treaty*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal must now examine the question of whether the breach of the License and its regulatory regime, in addition to its meaning under Argentine legislation, also results in a breach of the Treaty guarantees.\n\n*1. The claim of expropriation*\n-------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe principal claim made in this arbitration is that the measures adopted since early 2000, and particularly those taken in 2002 pursuant to the Emergency Law, have both directly and indirectly expropriated the Claimant\u2019s investment in a manner contrary to the protection granted under Article IV of the Treaty. The Claimant argues that its investment comprises the equity in CGS and CGP, and also the specific contractual rights arising from the License regime. The Claimant maintains that its deprivation is permanent rather than merely ephemeral, and that no prompt, adequate and effective compensation has been paid. In the Claimant\u2019s view, compensation must be paid irrespective of the purpose of the measures taken.83\n\n*Compania del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S. A. v. Republic of Costa Rica,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Final Award of February 17, 2000, 15 ICSID Review\u2014FILJ 169 (2000), paras. 71, 72.\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the effects of the measures taken by the Government have been to significantly reduce the licensees\u2019 revenues, withhold owed subsidies, restrict the severance of employees to control costs, permanently repudiate vested legal rights, require the continuing provision of service regardless of unilateral changes made to the regime, subject the licensees to a coerced renegotiation process, and exclude the licensees from tariff adjustments if they seek to enforce their legal rights.\n\n273.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent\u2019s measures resulted in the direct expropriation of the rights conferred on it by law and contract, in that all of these rights have been repudiated by the Emergency Law. The Claimant argues that since a claim for direct expropriation was not pleaded or addressed in *CMS,* the fact that in that case it was held that no expropriation had taken place is irrelevant to the resolution of the instant dispute, in which direct expropriation has allegedly occurred. The Claimant further argues that in *CMS* no question of expropriation of vested contractual and legal rights was pleaded. The Claimant invokes in support of its argument an OPIC \"Memorandum of Determinations\" of August 2, 2005 concerning an insurance claim brought by Enron in a similar dispute with Argentina, and concluding that \"[\u00a1International arbitral tribunals have recognized that rights under contracts are property subject to expropriation.\"84\n\nOPIC Memorandum of Determinations; Expropriation Claim of Ponderosa Assets, L.P.; Argentina, Contract of Insurance No. D733, August 5, 2005; *Enron Corp, and Ponderosa Assets, L. P. v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Award of May 22, 2007, para. 235.\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that the measures in question are \"tantamount to expropriation,\" and thus constitute an indirect or creeping expropriation unfolding over time and resulting in a cumulative substantial destruction of the investment\u2019s value. This kind of measure, the Claimant asserts, not only pertains to the day-to-day management and control of the investment, as was discussed in *CMS,* but also includes various forms of regulatory action resulting in the abrogation and repudiation of stabilization rights granted in the Licenses, just as the measures resulted in an interference with legitimate expectation, the assurances offered to induce the investment, and the capacity for rational decision-making on behalf of the business.\n\n275.\n\nThe Respondent argues as a preliminary point that the only rights which the Claimant could invoke in the context of expropriation are those relating to its condition as shareholder. The Respondent contends that the Claimant cannot lay claim to contractual or other rights since these pertain exclusively to the licensees.\n\n276.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the claims of direct and indirect expropriation on the basis of several tests that, in its view, are accepted in arbitral and judicial decisions as well as in the literature on expropriation. It first invokes the test of redistribution, arguing that there has been no transfer of property rights to the benefit of the Government or consumers. The Respondent asserts that there is no expropriation without redistribution.85 The Respondent further argues that temporary measures, particularly emergency measures, do not qualify as expropriation as they do not entail a permanent deprivation of earnings or corporate rights, and as no such effects can be shown in the present dispute. The Respondent further contends that: (i) a substantial deprivation of fundamental property rights must be established, and that no such deprivation has taken place or been proven in this case; (ii) losses must be significant, and that the Claimant instead continues to benefit from earnings; (iii) the value of the investment would have been further reduced had the measures not been adopted; and (iv) a mere contract violation cannot be turned into a Treaty claim.\n\n*Ronald S. Lauder v. The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL Arbitration Proceeding, Final Award of September 3, 2001, available at http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/LauderAward.pdf, cited in Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial, para. 330.\n\n277.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent argues that the purpose of the measures is relevant to the determination of an expropriation claim, particularly if such measures are adopted under the police power of the State and are proportional to the requirements of public interest. Moreover, the Respondent maintains, the Treaty does not protect legitimate expectations, but rather only specific rights. The Respondent argues that in this case none of the measures questioned can be assimilated to those deemed in other cases to be inconsistent with the guarantees offered to induce investment, or amounts to a destruction of the capacity for rational decision-making. It is also asserted that a legitimate expectation cannot in any event arise from mere road shows or information materials not attributable to the Government.\n\n278.\n\nThe Tribunal is again grateful to the parties\u2019 counsel for having undertaken a detailed explanation of their respective views on the issue of expropriation, and for invoking in support of their arguments a wealth of decisions, scholarly opinions and other authorities that allow the Tribunal to understand the parties\u2019 arguments in all their aspects and differences.\n\n279.\n\nThe first question which the Tribunal must consider is that concerning the protected investment. The parties do not dispute that equity is a protected investment under the Treaty, but they differ on whether the Claimant has other rights, particularly those of a legal or contractual nature. As the Tribunal explained in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Treaty definition of investment is quite broad, with the equity investment being in this context the vehicle through which a complex business relationship is developed. The investment can also be affected in other ways by the measures in question. This is the case, for example, with the measures affecting the tariff regime envisaged in the License, which is the key factor determining the success or failure of the equity investment in CGS and CGP. The expropriation claim can therefore refer to those elements of the investment that are inextricably linked to the legal and contractual framework that governs the operation of the business.\n\n280.\n\nThis discussion turns out in any event to be rather academic in view of the Tribunal having been persuaded by the merits of the Respondent\u2019s argument on expropriation. The Tribunal does not in fact believe that there can be a direct form of expropriation if at least some essential component of the property right has not been transferred to a different beneficiary, in particular the State. In this case, it can be argued that economic benefits may have to some extent been transferred from the industry to consumers, or from the industry to another industrial sector, and that this will ultimately benefit society and the State as a whole. This does not, however, amount to an effect upon a legal element of the property held, such as title to property.\n\n281.\n\nIt is quite true, as argued by the Claimant, that interference with contractual rights can in certain circumstances amount to an expropriation. Yet, in the instant case the Tribunal is not persuaded that such has been the result of the measures taken. In spite of all the difficulties which the Licensees and the investors have experienced, and which have doubtlessly affected rational management,86 they are still the rightful owners of the companies and their business. No one else has or could lawfully claim any such right. While the noted adverse effects can give rise to compensation, they cannot do so in connection with direct expropriation. The same is true with respect to the breach of stability clauses under the contract which, while potentially resulting in damage, is to be protected against and eventually compensated under a separate Treaty guarantee rather than under the heading of expropriation.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Martin Juan Blaquier of June 30, 2003, Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 7E, para. 40.\n\n282.\n\nIt is at this point that the intention to expropriate becomes relevant, and the parties have discussed this matter with clear attention. The Tribunal is persuaded that while many damages can be inflicted unintentionally, and as such will be entitled to compensation if liability is found to exist, a transfer of property and ownership requires positive intent. This is not a question of formality, but rather one of establishing a causal link between the measure in question and the title to property.\n\n283.\n\nThe question of indirect or creeping expropriation requires a more complex assessment. The Tribunal has no doubt about the fact that such expropriation can arise from many kinds of measures, and that these have to be assessed by their cumulative effects. Yet, in this case, the Tribunal is not convinced that such has happened either.\n\n284.\n\nThe Respondent has invoked, among other authorities, the list of measures considered in the *Pope & Talbot* case as being tantamount to expropriation. These are, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, representative of the legal standard required to make a determination on alleged indirect expropriation. Substantial deprivation results under this list from depriving the investor of control over the investment, managing the day-to-day operations of the company, arresting and detaining company officials or employees, supervising the work of officials, interfering in administration, impeding the distribution of dividends, interfering in the appointment of officials or managers, or depriving the company of its property or control in whole or in part.87 The list of measures could be expanded significantly in the light of the findings of many other tribunals,88 but would still have to meet the standard of having as a result a substantial deprivation of rights.\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada,* Interim Award of June 26, 2000, para. 100.\n\nCampbell McLachlan, L. Shore and M. Weiniger: International Investment Arbitration. Substantive Principles. 2007, 298-309.\n\n285.\n\nMany of the measures discussed in the instant case have had a very adverse effect on the conduct of the business concerned. This is, however, again a question that the Treaty addresses in the context of other safeguards for protecting the investor. A finding of indirect expropriation would require more than adverse effects. It would require that the investor no longer be in control of its business operation, or that the value of the business have been virtually annihilated. This is not the case in the present dispute.\n\n286.\n\nThe Tribunal must accordingly conclude that the Government did not breach the standard of protection established in Article IV(1) of the Treaty by adopting the measures complained of. This holding is without prejudice to the other findings which the Tribunal will make below in connection with these measures.\n\n287.\n\nThe question of devaluation has also been discussed by the parties in the context of its influence on a determination of expropriation. Each party has done so particularly in the light of the meaning it respectively attaches to the *Himpurna* case.89 As the Tribunal has explained above, however, this is not a dispute about devaluation, nor has such been claimed. The dispute is instead about an alleged breach of rights under the regulatory framework and the License. The devaluation discussion thus does not alter the Tribunal\u2019s determination about expropriation.\n\n*Himpurna California Energy Ltd. v. Republic of Indonesia,* May 4, 1999.\n\n288.\n\nLegitimate expectation is also an issue which the parties have discussed, and is subject to protection under broadly conceived treaty standards and international law. This does not mean, however, that this right will operate to make the test for indirect expropriation less stringent.\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that the Government also had many expectations in respect of the investment that were not met or were otherwise frustrated. Apart from the question of investment risk, it is alleged that there was, *inter alia,* the expectation that the investor would bear any losses resulting from its activity, work diligently and in good faith, not claim extraordinary earnings exceeding by far fair and reasonable tariffs, resort to local courts for dispute settlement, dutifully observe contract commitments, and respect the regulatory framework. The Tribunal notes that to the extent that any such issues would be within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to decide, and could have resulted in breaches of the Treaty, the Respondent would be entitled to raise a counterclaim. While this right has been resorted to by Respondent States only to a limited extent in cases submitted to ICSID tribunals, nothing prevents its exercise in the light of Article 46 of the Convention and Rule 40 of the Arbitration Rules. This right was not exercised in the present case.\n\n*2. The claim concerning the standard of fair and equitable treatment*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nThe Claimant has argued that, in addition to effecting an expropriation, the Respondent has in various ways breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment established under Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty, including by failing to act in good faith, frustrating the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations, unreasonably interfering with the investor\u2019s property rights, violating and repudiating assurances and representations offered to attract foreign investment, altering the legal and business environment upon which the Claimant had relied in making the investment, failing to provide a stable and predictable legal environment, and abusing its rights.\n\n291.\n\nThe Claimant explains that while this particular standard originates in the obligation of good faith under international law, it has gradually acquired a specific meaning in the light of decisions and treaties, and requires, *inter alia,* a treatment compatible with the expectations of foreign investors,90 the observance of arrangements on which the investor has relied in making the investment,91 and the maintenance of a stable legal and business framework.92\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States*, (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award of May 29, 2003, 43 *ILM* 133 (2004), para. 115.\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. v.

The Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA Case No. UN3467, Final Award of July 1, 2004, http://www.asil.org/ilib/OEPC-Ecuador.pdf, para. 183.\n\n292.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s argument on this point is based on the premise that fair and equitable treatment is a standard indistinguishable from the customary international minimum standard, and that it is not for tribunals to set out its meaning and even less to legislate on the matter. The Respondent asserts that this view is confirmed by the practice of a number of governments, NAFTA and ICSID decisions, and opinions of learned writers.\n\n293.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, what has been criticized by recent decisions is a kind of conduct that evidences either inconsistency in State action,93 radical and arbitrary modification of the regulatory framework,94 or endless normative changes to the detriment of the investor\u2019s business as decided in the *OEPC* case cited. None of these, the Respondent\u2019s argument follows, is present in the instant case since the measures adopted were eminently reasonable in the light of the economic crisis described above, and of the changes in the economic conditions of the country.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Award of May 25, 2004, http://www.asil.org/ilib/MTDvChile.pdf, para. 164.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States,* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award of May 29, 2003, 43 ILM 133 (2004), para. 154\n\n294.\n\nThe Respondent maintains in particular that devaluation was the result of market decisions, and that the consistent decisions of courts in other crises have reaffirmed the constitutionality of such a measure, most notably in the context of the Great Depression in the U.S. The *Thunderbird v. Mexico* decision95 has also been invoked by the Respondent in support of its view that the standard of fair and equitable treatment does not include the protection of legitimate expectations, and it is no different from the international minimum standard.96\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States,* Award of January 26, 2006, http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2006/itn\\_award.pdf, para. 147.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post Hearing Brief, para. 100.\n\n295.\n\nAgain, counsel for the parties have competently discussed their respective views and arguments in great detail, with particular reference made to the many past and contemporary decisions that have purported to clarify the standard of treatment required under international law generally and bilateral investment treaties in particular.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the Respondent to be right in arguing that fair and equitable treatment is a standard that is none too clear and precise. This is because international law is itself not too clear or precise as concerns the treatment due to foreign citizens, traders and investors. This is the case because the pertinent standards have gradually evolved over the centuries. Customary international law, treaties of friendship, commerce and navigation, and more recently bilateral investment treaties, have all contributed to this development.97 Not even in the case of rules which appear to have coalesced, such as denial of justice, is there today much certainty.\n\nStephen Vasciannie: \"The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Investment Law and Practice,\" British Yearbook of International Law, (1999), vol. 70, p. 100.\n\n297.\n\nThe evolution that has taken place is for the most part the outcome of a case-by-case determination by courts and tribunals, as is evidenced by many investment treaty and NAFTA decisions, including the *Tecmed, OEPC* and *Pope & Talbot* cases cited. This shows that, as with the international minimum standard, there has been a fragmentary and gradual development. However, it has been rightly commented that essentially \"the purpose of the clause as used in BIT practice is to fill gaps which may be left by the more specific standards, in order to obtain the level of investor protection intended by the treaties.\"98 The principle of good faith is thus relied on as the common guiding beacon that will orient the understanding and interpretation of obligations, just as happens under civil codes.99\n\nRudolf Dolzer: \"Fair and Equitable Treatment: a Key Standard in Investment Treaties\", The International Lawyer, 2005, Vol. 39, No. 1, 87-106, at p. 90\n\n*Ibid,* at 91.\n\n298.\n\nThe essence of the protection sought was well explained in *Tecmed,* where the tribunal held in the light of the good faith requirement that under international law, the foreign investment must be treated in a manner such that it \"will not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by foreign investor to make the investment.\"100 This requirement becomes particularly meaningful when the investment has been attracted and induced by means of assurances and representations, as has been established in the jurisprudence that the Claimant has invoked.101 The recent *Thunderbird* case does not alter at all the meaning of this protection in the context of fair and equitable treatment. This is so first because it reaffirms the relevance of the standard in question, and next, most importantly, because it finally decided the issue with respect to a question arising from a misrepresentation made by the Claimant to the Mexican Government that precisely violated the principle of good faith which is at the heart of the concept of fair and equitable treatment.102\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States,* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award of May 29, 2003, para. 154.\n\n*Embassy Limousines & Services v. European Parliament,* [1998] ECR 11-4239, para. 8, cited in Claimant\u2019s Memorial footnote 708.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post Hearing brief of April 3, 2006, para. 47.\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent has distinguished a number of recent cases in which the principle of fair and equitable treatment has been upheld, particularly the *Tecmed, MTD* and *OEPC* cases. This is correct given that the circumstances of individual cases are almost invariably different. There remains, however, a requirement of good faith that permeates the whole approach to the protection granted under treaties and contracts. Even if the standard were restricted to a question of reasonableness and proportionality not entailing objective liability, as the Respondent argues in the light of *Tecmed,* there are nevertheless expectations arising from promises that must be respected when relied upon by the beneficiary.\n\n300.\n\nIt follows that it would be wrong to believe that fair and equitable treatment is a kind of peripheral requirement. To the contrary, it ensures that even where there is no clear justification for making a finding of expropriation, as in the present case, there is still a standard which serves the purpose of justice and can of itself redress damage that is unlawful and that would otherwise pass unattended. Whether this result is achieved by the application of one or several standards is a determination to be made in the light of the facts of each dispute. What counts is that in the end the stability of the law and the observance of legal obligations are assured, thereby safeguarding the very object and purpose of the protection sought by the treaty.\n\n301.\n\nIt must also be kept in mind that on occasion the line separating the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard from an indirect expropriation can be very thin, particularly if the breach of the former standard is massive and long-lasting. In case of doubt, however, judicial prudence and deference to State functions are better served by opting for a determination in the light of the fair and equitable treatment standard. This also explains why the compensation granted to redress the wrong done might not be too different on either side of the line.\n\n302.\n\nIt might well be that in some circumstances in which the international minimum standard is sufficiently elaborate and clear, the standard of fair and equitable treatment might be equated with it. But in other cases, it might as well be the opposite, so that the fair and equitable treatment standard will be more precise than its customary international law forefathers. On many occasions, the issue will not even be whether the fair and equitable treatment standard is different or more demanding than the customary standard, but only whether it is more specific, less generic and spelled out in a contemporary fashion so that its application is more appropriate to the case under consideration. This does not exclude the possibility that the fair and equitable treatment standard imposed under a treaty can also eventually require a treatment additional to or beyond that of customary law. Such does not appear to be the case with the present dispute, however. The very fact that recent interpretations of investment treaties have purported to change the meaning or extent of the standard only confirms that, those specific instruments aside, the standard is or might be a broader one.\n\n303.\n\nThe measures in question in this case have beyond any doubt substantially changed the legal and business framework under which the investment was decided and implemented. Where there was business certainty and stability, there is now the opposite.103 The tariff regime speaks for itself in this respect. A long-term business outlook has been transformed into a day-to-day discussion about what is next to come. The guarantees given are no longer available. The Respondent might be right in distinguishing this case from the situations that recent decisions had in view, but this does not mean that the present conditions are consistent with the meaning of the protection granted under the Treaty.\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability of October 3, 2006, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/pdf/ARB021LGE-Decision-on-Liability-en.pdf. paras. 124, 125.\n\n304.\n\nEven assuming that the Respondent was guided by the best of intentions, what the Tribunal has no reason to doubt, there has here been an objective breach of the fair and equitable treatment due under the Treaty. The Tribunal thus holds that the standard established by Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty has not been observed, to the detriment of the Claimant\u2019s rights.\n\n*3. The claim concerning the alleged breach of the umbrella clause*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nThe Claimant has also brought to this Tribunal a claim about an alleged breach of the observance of the obligations into which the Respondent entered with regard to the investment in the light of the \"umbrella clause\" of Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty. This aspect of the claim is built on the premise that the envisaged protection is an expression of the obligation to observe the principle *pacta sunt servanda.* The Claimant cites in this context the view of Judge Higgins to the effect that this principle and its related acquired rights \"emphasize the protection that the private party has been given against either a later change of mind by the State or against the exercise of the State\u2019s regulatory powers.\"104\n\nR. Higgins, *The Taking of Property by the State: Recent Developments in International Law,* 176 Recueil des Cours 267, 347 (1982), as cited in Claimants\u2019 Consolidated Memorial on the merits, para. 444, footnote. 721.\n\n306.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the umbrella clause applies to obligations arising from a contract or from broader undertakings contained in the State\u2019s own law, and that the Respondent\u2019s measures breached every commitment made in the Gas Law, the Gas Decree and the License. The Claimant makes particular reference to the tariff regime and the Government\u2019s commitment not to amend the License without the consent of CGS or CGP, respectively.\n\n307.\n\nThe Respondent opposes this claim, arguing that under customary law violations of contracts cannot be equated with a treaty breach and consequently do not engage the international responsibility of the State.105 The Respondent further contends that, as held in *SGS v. Pakistan,* contract claims do not qualify as BIT claims.106 The Respondent also maintains that the tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines,* while disagreeing with some aspects of the *Pakistan* decision, still held that the umbrella clause comprises only obligations undertaken with respect to a specific investment, and thus that the clause does not extend to ordinary contractual breaches, which must instead be taken to the contract forum.\n\n*Noble Ventures, Inc. v.

Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment of July 3, 2002, para. 96.\n\n308.\n\nIn any event, according to the Respondent, since the commitments were made in respect of the Licensees they cannot be invoked by the Claimant, and the License does not qualify as an investment agreement. The Respondent invokes the *Noble Ventures v. Romania* decision insofar as it would limit the application of the umbrella clause to investment contracts which do not include a license.107 The Claimant opposes such an interpretation, finding instead that *Noble Ventures* referred to contracts made with regard to an investment.108 The Award in the *Encana* case109 has also been invoked by the Respondent as rejecting the view that a Claimant can rely on a contract to which the State and a local corporation in which the Claimant has invested are parties.110\n\nRespondent\u2019s Opening Statement, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 1, February 6, 2006, para. 160.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post Hearing brief of April 3, 2006, para. 50.\n\n*EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA Case No. UN3481, UNCITRAL, Award, of February 3, 2006.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post Hearing brief, para. 112.\n\n309.\n\nVarious recent decisions have dealt with the meaning and extent of the \"umbrella clause\", and the mystery surrounding the matter seems to be gradually lessening.111 The parties are in agreement that a contractual breach does not necessarily result in a Treaty breach unless it simultaneously violates a right or obligation protected under the Treaty. The difference between the parties arises rather from the view of one party that no breach of the License has occurred, or that, if the contrary is the case, the License is not an investment agreement made with the Claimant. The other party\u2019s view is that the violations of the License are manifest and not ordinary contractual breaches. Instead, they allegedly entail the violation of Treaty rights and obligations, and consequently trigger the operation of the umbrella clause.\n\n*Fedax NV v. Venezuela,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3), final award of March 9, 1998, *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case ARB/01/3), Award of May 22, 2007, paras. 275-276.\n\n310.\n\nThe Tribunal fully shares the view that ordinary commercial breaches of a contract are not the same as Treaty breaches, as was well explained by the tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines* when distinguishing a contractual dispute over payment from a Treaty dispute. So too, the Tribunal can only agree with the view adopted in *SGS v. Pakistan* that such a distinction is necessary so as to avoid an indefinite and unjustified extension of the umbrella clause. The decisions dealing with the issue of the umbrella clause and the role of contracts in a Treaty context have all distinguished breaches of contract from Treaty breaches on the basis of whether the breach has arisen from the conduct of an ordinary contract party, or rather involves a kind of conduct that only a sovereign State function or power could effect.112\n\n*Impregilo S.pA. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3), Decision on Jurisdiction of April 22, 2005, para. 260.\n\n311.\n\nIn many cases, it might be difficult to draw this distinction, as not every kind of conduct can be clearly ascribed to one or the other type. The measures discussed before this Tribunal are not, however, mere ordinary contractual breaches of a commercial nature. They are instead the outcome of major legal and regulatory changes introduced by the State, and give expression to a change of policy that is evidently not what was envisaged in the License and legal framework governing the privatization and the investments made in its context. Only the State, and not an ordinary contract party, can decide that such sweeping changes will operate as part of the public function. Contractual breaches made in this context are far from ordinary, and may in themselves be a source of Treaty violations if they affect a right protected under the Treaty.\n\n312.\n\nEven if the umbrella clause is considered in the light of the limited understanding provided for it by the *SGS v. Philippines* tribunal, to wit that it extends only to obligations undertaken with respect to a specific investment agreement and its related aspects, the clause applies in this case. Jurisdictional aspects aside, the License is the ultimate expression of a series of complex investment arrangements made with the specific intention of channeling the influx of capital into newly privatized companies. Such a network was required under the law and the regulations, and it is therefore impossible to argue now the separation of the License from the investments made in the resulting process.\n\n313.\n\nSpecific obligations undertaken not to freeze the tariffs or subject them to price controls, to compensate for any resulting differences if such actions were in fact taken, and not to amend the License without the licensee\u2019s consent are among the obligations that typically come under the protection of the umbrella clause. There are other obligations contained in the License and the law that could also eventually fall under the protection of the umbrella clause, such as those concerning detailed aspects of the tariff regime. As some of these relate more closely to the breach of fair and equitable treatment, they have been considered above.\n\n314.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that the breach of the aforementioned obligations undertaken in respect of the investment have resulted in a breach of the protection provided by the umbrella clause of Article II(2)(c).\n\n*4. The claim about arbitrariness and discrimination*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that there has also been a breach of Article II(2)(b) of the Treaty because the measures adopted are both arbitrary and discriminatory. The claim of arbitrariness is based on the argument that such measures destroyed the Claimant\u2019s rights and reasonable expectations, lacked proportionality, and were in violation of the law. The claim of discrimination for its part relies on the Claimant\u2019s view that the measures fell disproportionately on the largely foreign-owned gas sector.\n\n316.\n\nThe Respondent opposes this claim, asserting that the measures were consistent with the law and aimed at the continuing operation of the companies and the maintenance of their income and earnings, while at the same time being reasonable and proportionate to the purpose sought. In any event, the Respondent maintains, there was no intention to breach the rule of law or affect judicial propriety, with such intent being an element required by numerous judicial and arbitral decisions.\n\n317.\n\nNeither has there been any discrimination, the Respondent contends, because the regulated gas sector is very different from other sectors operating in a competitive market, such as banking, and because the entities involved are far from being in a similar or even comparable situation. In the Respondent\u2019s view, there cannot be discrimination if actors are treated differently in the light of each individual\u2019s or sector\u2019s requirements. Least of all has there been any capricious, irrational or absurdly differential treatment of the Claimant, who is not even among those who have suffered the most severe consequences of the measures adopted.\n\n318.\n\nAfter examining the detailed arguments of the parties and their supporting authorities and decisions, the Tribunal remains unpersuaded by the Claimant\u2019s view that there is here arbitrariness or discrimination. The measures adopted might have been good or bad, but this is not a matter which is for the Tribunal\u2019s to judge. As the Tribunal has already concluded, they were inconsistent with the domestic and Treaty frameworks. They were not, however, arbitrary in that they responded to what the Government believed and understood to be the best response to the unfolding crisis. Irrespective of the question of intent, a finding of arbitrariness requires that some important measure of impropriety be manifest. This is not found in a process which, although far from desirable, is nonetheless not entirely surprising in the context in which it took place.\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal reaches a similar conclusion in respect of the alleged discrimination. There are quite naturally important differences between the various affected sectors, so it is not surprising that different solutions might have been or are being sought for each. It could not be said, however, that any such sector has been particularly singled out either to have applied to it measures harsher than in respect of others, or conversely to be provided with a more beneficial remedy to the detriment of another. The Tribunal does not find that there has been any capricious, irrational or absurd differentiation in the treatment accorded to the Claimant as compared to other entities or sectors.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Respondent has not breached the duty of protection established under Article II(2)(b) of the Treaty.\n\n*5. The claim concerning the alleged failure to give full protection and security*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nLastly, the Claimant argues that there has been a failure to give full protection and security to its investment, as is required under Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty. The Claimant relies in this regard on the broader interpretation of this requirement made particularly in *CME,* in which the standard was deemed applicable not just to physical security but also to the legal protection of the investment.\n\n322.\n\nThe Respondent believes differently, arguing first that the standard relates only to physical protection and security, as is evidenced in *AAPL* and *AMT,* in which installations were destroyed. The Respondent next asserts that the support of *CME* does not mean that the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of the standard is the one accepted under international law, particularly as it was contemporaneously contradicted by the opposite conclusion in *Lauder.*\n\n323.\n\nThere is no doubt that historically this particular standard has been developed in the context of physical protection and the security of a company\u2019s officials, employees and facilities. The Tribunal cannot exclude as a matter of principle the possibility that there might be cases in which a broader interpretation could be justified. Such situations would, however, no doubt constitute specific exceptions to the operation of the traditional understanding of the principle. If such an exception were justified, then the situation would become difficult to distinguish from that resulting in a breach of fair and equitable treatment, and even from some form of expropriation.\n\n324.\n\nIn this case, there has been no allegation of a failure to give full protection and security to officials, employees or installations. The general argument made about a possible lack of protection and security in the broader ambit of the legal and political system has in no way been proven or even adequately developed. The Tribunal accordingly rejects this claim and finds that no breach of Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty has taken place.\n\n*The alternative plea of emergency*\n-----------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nIn case the Tribunal found that a breach of the Treaty had taken place, the Government has pleaded in the alternative an exemption from liability in the light of a national emergency or state of necessity under domestic law, general international law and the Treaty, all based on the severity of the crisis that has affected the country since 2000.\n\n326.\n\nThe Respondent has explained in detail the severity that characterized the crisis affecting the country, which in its view threatened the very existence of the State and its independence. The Respondent asserts in particular that the significant decreases in the Argentine Gross Domestic Product, consumption and investment during the crisis period, together with deflation and the reduction in value of Argentine corporations, resulted in widespread unemployment and poverty, with dramatic consequences for health, nutrition and social policy. Public institutions were also no longer functioning. A witness for the Respondent describes the crisis as \"a combination of political, economic, financial, institutional, fiscal circumstances that coalesced.\"113\n\nTestimony of Mr. Eduardo Ratti, Elearing Transcript, Vol. 3, February 8, 2006, pp. 442-445.\n\n327.\n\nWith a view to overcoming such difficulties, there was an urgent need to resort to emergency, described by the Respondent as a severe form of necessity, and which materialized in the 2002 Emergency Law. The Respondent explains in this respect that the Emergency Law was not the cause of the unfolding economic emergency, but rather the normative consequence of a situation that had become manifest in world financial markets. The Respondent maintains that the measures adopted were the remedy recommended by distinguished economists and led to the gradual recovery that is noticeable at present.\n\n*1. Necessity and emergency under the Argentine Constitution*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the Argentine Constitution provides for various kinds of emergency measures, including most prominently those for dealing with economic emergencies such as the one declared by Congress in this case. The Respondent contends that as a public act, such a declaration benefits from a presumption of legality, albeit subject to constitutional control by the judiciary. According to the Respondent, the emergency legislation meets the requirements laid down by judicial decisions to the extent that there exists a state of necessity, the rules are aimed at attending to a public interest, the remedy introduced is proportional to the emergency, and its time frame is reasonable and related to the causes of the emergency. So too, in the view of the Respondent, the measures enacted by the Government when acting on powers delegated by Congress observe the legal requirements of emergency as provided under the Constitution.\n\n329.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent has not demonstrated that the degree of threat required to invoke the defense of necessity has been met, particularly since the existence of the State has not been imperiled as if it faced a military threat. Nor, according to the Claimant, has it been demonstrated that the derogation from the specific guarantees and disputed obligations was justified.\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined above the circumstances of the measures complained of in the context of the Argentine legislation. While there can be no doubt that \"emergency\" has been continuously invoked and recognized in Argentina, it is precisely for this reason that the courts have been careful in stating the conditions under which emergency may be exercised and legally validated. The case of *Peralta* is well known for having set out the limits of emergency legislation with regard to both the temporal effects of the measures taken and the obligation not to alter the substance of contracts.114 During the hearing, the *Bourdieu* case was discussed in the context of the recognition that concessions and other contracts with the State entail \"ownership rights\" protected under the Constitution.115 In the context of the present emergency, the Tribunal is mindful of the specific requirements laid down in *Provincia de San Luis,* and these, as has been concluded above, have not been met by the emergency legislation. It follows that the very constitutional provisions which were subject to judicial control and which led to the definition of those conditions cannot be invoked to preclude a finding of wrongfulness as to the measures adopted if they do not comply with the conditions indicated.\n\n*Peralta v. Estado Nacional,* CSJN 313 Fallos 1513 (1990), cited in the Second Expert Report of Professor H\u00e9ctor A. Mairal of September 14, 2005, Cl. Exh 188, paras. 91-96.\n\nExamination by Mr. Roberto Aguirre Luzi, Elearing Transcript, Vol. 3, February 8, 2006, pp. 465-466; see also Supreme Court in *Bourdieu v. Municipalidad de la Capital,* 145 Fallos 307, 327(1925), cited in the Second Expert Report of Professor H\u00e9ctor A. Mairal of September 14, 2005, Cl. Exh 188, para. 62, footnote 38.\n\n331.\n\nThe discussion about institutional survival and preservation of the constitutional order has also been related to the provisions of the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights, to which Argentina is a party. At the hearing, Counsel for the Respondent put the following question to a legal expert: \"[W]ould Argentina have been compelled because of the Inter-American Convention to maintain its constitutional order towards the end of 2001, 2002, and afterwards?\"116 The answer from Professor Reisman was \"[y]es.\"117\n\nRemarks of Mr. Gabriel Bottini, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11.2006, pp. 1021-1022.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor W. Michael Reisman, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006, p. 1022.\n\n332.\n\nThis debate raises the complex relationship between investment treaties, emergency and the human rights of both citizens and property owners. Yet, the real issue in the instant case is whether the constitutional order and the survival of the State were imperiled by the crisis, or instead whether the Government still had many tools at its disposal to cope with the situation. The Tribunal believes that the constitutional order was not on the verge of collapse, as evidenced by, among many examples, the orderly constitutional transition that carried the country through five different Presidencies in a few days\u2019 time, followed by elections and the reestablishment of public order. Even if emergency legislation became necessary in this context, legitimately acquired rights could still have been accommodated by means of temporary measures and renegotiation.\n\n*2. The plea of state of necessity under customary international law*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nThe Respondent maintains in this respect that the concept of \"state of necessity\" has consolidated itself under international law so as to foreclose any wrongfulness on the part of measures adopted in its context and to exempt the State from international responsibility. The *Neptunus* case and the *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* judgment, as well as Article 25 of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility, are invoked in support of this conclusion.\n\n334.\n\nThe Respondent argues in particular that it has not contributed to the state of necessity since most of the relevant factors were exogenous, the measures adopted were the only means to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril because otherwise the situation would have gone out of control, no essential interest of other States benefiting from the obligation or of the international community as a whole have been seriously impaired, and the Claimant, CGS and CGP have not been treated differently from other investors in this sector.\n\n335.\n\nIn answering the Claimant\u2019s arguments, the Respondent distinguishes the *Himpurna* case from its own situation on the ground that in that case the State company PLN had expressly waived in the contract the possibility of invoking *force majeure* in justification of non-performance, and that the alleged events were not proven. This, in the Respondent\u2019s view, explains the tribunal\u2019s decision not to admit economic emergency. So too, the Respondent distinguishes *Socobelge,* in which the financial situation of Greece never came to be considered by the Permanent Court of International Justice.\n\n336.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes in particular the view of experts that Argentina had no other option than to undertake the pesification of its contractual relations since every other remedy was unviable.118 Furthermore, as already noted, it is argued that Argentina did not contribute to the situation of necessity because the main difficulties originated in external shocks, including the Asian and Russian crises, devaluation in Brazil, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. An expert for Argentina concludes that the option of dollarization at the old parity in order to avoid depreciation \"was altogether undesirable and most likely unfeasible.\"119\n\nFirst Expert Report of Professor Nouriel Roubini of July 13, 2005, para. 37 *et seq.*\n\nSecond Expert Report of Professor Nouriel Roubini of November 28, 2005, par 58.\n\n337.\n\nFollowing the *Gould* case, the Respondent concludes that in view of the existence of a state of necessity, any damage caused is not attributable to the State as it originates in \"social and economic forces beyond the power of the state to control through the exercise of due diligence.\"120 Compensation is thus not due, in the Respondent\u2019s view.\n\n*Gould. Marketing Inc., as succesor to Hoffman Export Corporation v. Ministry of National Defense of Iran,* 3 IRAN-US C.T.R. 147 (AL RA 202), cited in Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, footnote 213.\n\n338.\n\nWhile the Claimant shares the Respondent\u2019s view that Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility reflects customary international law in this matter, it believes that the Respondent has not met the requirements for the preclusion of a wrongfulness finding under that Article. Specifically, the Claimant maintains that Argentina has not demonstrated that it was threatened by a grave and imminent peril, that the measures adopted were the only way to safeguard against that peril, that the obligation in question does not exclude the defense of necessity, and that the Government did not contribute to the state of necessity. The Claimant relies upon *Himpurna* and *Socobelge* in support of these assertions.\n\n339.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s assertion, the crisis finds its origins in endogenous factors which, in the view of another expert, are almost entirely the result of Argentina\u2019s own policy failures,121 particularly the failure to implement structural reforms in the 1990\u2019s to ensure fiscal discipline, labor market flexibility, open foreign trade and the maintenance of the currency board\u2019s credibility. The Claimant further argues that options other than pesification were available, and thus that pesification was not the only way to address the crisis. The Claimant also points out that among the options discussed were the structural reforms earlier noted, the agreed restructuring of Argentina\u2019s debt, dollarization, and devaluation without pesification. The expert explained that such alternative plans have worked in other countries, such as Uruguay.\n\nExpert Report of Professor Sebastian Edwards of September 13, 2005, Claimant\u2019s Reply memorial, Exhibit 183, paras. 33-59\n\n340.\n\nAsked by the Tribunal about the various alternatives available to Argentina in the crisis, the Claimant\u2019s expert stated that, in his view, there was still time in 2000 and 2001 to implement the appropriate policies to sustain the currency board, and that this was the first best option. Because this was not done, dollarization was preferable to devaluation in the expert\u2019s view, and even in the case of devaluation there was no need to undertake a costly pesification of contracts.122\n\nExpert Statement of Professor Sebastian Edwards, Elearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006,pp.1211-1215.\n\n341.\n\nThe expert opinion of Professor Sebasti\u00e1n Edwards can be summarized as reaching the following main conclusions: (i) Argentina itself primarily caused its economic crisis by making policy mistakes prior to 2001, and also through a series of additional mistakes in 2001; (ii) external shocks played a limited role in the Argentine economic crisis; (iii) the country had a number of options available to it throughout the 1990\u2019s, and also during 2000 and 2001; and (iv) even after devaluation, Argentina did not have to pesify.123\n\nExpert Report of Professor Sebastian Edwards of September 13, 2005, Claimant\u2019s Reply memorial, Exhibit 183, paras. 129-139.\n\n342.\n\nA rebuttal opinion by Professor Nouriel Roubini was introduced by the Respondent in opposition to the Claimant\u2019s views and its expert\u2019s analysis.124 Professor Roubini has also explained in other reports that at least some domestic factors contributed to the collapse of the currency board, most notably structural rigidities in the economy, fiscal deficits and debt accumulation. In Professor Roubini\u2019s view, however, the crisis was triggered mostly by external shocks.125\n\nSecond Expert Report of Professor Nouriel Roubini of November 28, 2005, para. 11 *et seq.*\n\nFirst Expert Report of Professor Nouriel Roubini of July 13, 2005, paras. 16-20.\n\n343.\n\nThe conclusion which the Claimant reaches is that even in the case of a state of necessity, the preclusion of wrongfulness is established without prejudice to: (i) the requirement of compliance with the obligation concerned if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists; and (ii) the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the measures adopted. This is allegedly in accordance with Article 27 of the Articles on State Responsibility, as it does not allow for the permanent repudiation of rights or necessary compensation.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the parties\u2019 understanding of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility as reflecting the state of customary international law on the matter. This is not to say that the Articles are a treaty or even themselves a part of customary law. They are simply the learned and systematic expression of the law on state of necessity developed by courts, tribunals and other sources over a long period of time. Article 25 states:\n\n*1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:*\n\n*(a) Is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and*\n\n*(b) Does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.*\n\n*2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:*\n\n*(a) The international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or*\n\n*(b) The State has contributed to the situation of necessity.*\n\n345.\n\nThere is no disagreement either about the fact that a state of necessity is a most exceptional remedy that is subject to very strict conditions because otherwise it would open the door to States to elude compliance with any international obligation. Article 25 accordingly begins by cautioning that the state of necessity \"may not be invoked\" unless such conditions are met. Whether in fact the Respondent\u2019s invocation of a state of necessity meets those conditions is the difficult task that the Tribunal must now undertake.\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined with particular attention the recent decision on liability126 and subsequent award on damages127 in the *LG&E* case as they have dealt with mostly identical questions concerning emergency and state of necessity. The decision on liability has been contrasted with the finding of the Tribunal in *CMS.128* While two arbitrators sitting in the present case were also members of the tribunal in the ***CMS*** case the matter has been examined anew. This Tribunal must note, first, that in addition to differences in the legal interpretation of the Treaty in this context, an important question that distinguishes the **LG&E** decision on liability from *CMS,* and for that matter also from the recent award in *Enron,129* lies in the assessment of the facts. While the ***CMS*** and **Enron** tribunals have not been persuaded by the severity of the Argentine crisis as a factor capable of triggering the state of necessity, **LG&E** has considered the situation in a different light and justified the invocation of emergency and necessity, albeit for a limited period of time. This Tribunal, however, is not any more persuaded than the ***CMS*** and **Enron** tribunals about the crisis justifying the operation of emergency and necessity, although it also readily accepts that the changed economic conditions have an influence on the questions of valuation and compensation, as will be examined further below.\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability of October 3, 2006.\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Award, July 25, 2007.\n\nMathieu Raux: \"La reconnaissance de l\u2019\u00e9tat de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 dans la derni\u00e8re sentence relative au contentieux argentin: LG&E c/Argentine\", *Gazette duPalais,* 13-14 D\u00e9cembre 2006, 56-60.\n\n*Enron Corp, and Ponderosa Assets, L. P. v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case ARB/01/3), Award of May 22, 2007.\n\n347.\n\nThe first condition which Article 25 sets out is that the act in question must be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. The Tribunal must accordingly establish whether the Argentine crisis qualified as one affecting an essential interest of the State. The opinions of experts are sharply divided on this issue. They range from those that consider the crisis as having had gargantuan and catastrophic proportions, to those that believe that it was no different from many other contemporary crisis situations around the world.\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that there was a severe crisis, and that in such a context it was unlikely that business could have continued as usual. Yet, the argument that such a situation compromised the very existence of the State and its independence, and thereby qualified as one involving an essential State interest, is not convincing. Questions of public order and social unrest could have been handled, as in fact they were, just as questions of political stabilization were handled under the constitutional arrangements in force.\n\n349.\n\nThis issue is in turn connected with the alleged existence of a grave and imminent peril that could threaten the essential interest. While the Government had a duty to prevent a worsening of the situation, and could not simply leave events to follow their own course, there is no convincing evidence that events were actually out of control or had become unmanageable.\n\n350.\n\nIt is thus quite evident that measures had to be adopted to offset the unfolding crisis, but whether the measures taken under the Emergency Law were the \"only way\" to achieve this result, and whether no other alternative was available, are questions on which the parties and their experts are profoundly divided, as noted above. A rather sad global comparison of experiences in the handling of economic crises shows that there are always many approaches to addressing and resolving such critical events. It is therefore difficult to justify the position that only one of them was available in the Argentine case.\n\n351.\n\nWhile one or the other party would like the Tribunal to point out which alternative was recommendable, it is not the task of the Tribunal to substitute its view for the Government\u2019s choice between economic options. It is instead the Tribunal\u2019s duty only to determine whether the choice made was the only one available, and this does not appear to have been the case.\n\n352.\n\nArticle 25 next requires that the measures in question do not seriously impair the interests of a State or States toward which the obligations exist, or of the international community as a whole. The interest of the international community does not appear to be in any way impaired in this context, as it is an interest of a general kind. That of other States will be discussed below in connection with the Treaty obligations. At that point, it will also be discussed whether the Treaty excludes necessity, this being another condition peremptorily laid down by the Article.\n\n353.\n\nA further condition that Article 25 imposes is that the State cannot invoke necessity if it has contributed to the situation giving rise to a state of necessity. This is of course the expression of a general principle of law devised to prevent a party from taking legal advantage of its own fault. In spite of the parties\u2019 respective claims that the factors precipitating the crisis were either endogenous or exogenous, the truth seems to be somewhere in the middle, with both kinds of factors having intervened. This mix has in fact come to be generally recognized by experts, officials and international agencies.\n\n354.\n\nThis means that there has to some extent been a substantial contribution of the State to the situation giving rise to the state of necessity, and that it therefore cannot be claimed that the burden falls entirely on exogenous factors. This state of affairs has not been the making of a particular administration, given that it was a problem which had been compounding its effects for a decade. Still, the State must answer for it as a whole.\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal must note in addition that, as held in the *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* decision with reference to the work of the International Law Commission, the various conditions discussed above must be cumulatively met. This brings the standard governing the invocation of necessity to a still higher echelon. In the light of the various elements examined above, the Tribunal concludes that the requirements for a state of necessity under customary international law have not been fully met in this case.\n\n*3. The plea of necessity under Article IV (3) of the Treaty*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nThe Respondent also justifies the invocation of necessity under the terms of Article IV(3) of the Treaty. This Article provides:\n\n*3. Nationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall he accorded treatment by such other Party no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the more favorable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.*\n\n357.\n\nThe Respondent, following the holding in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* that the essential interest of the State cannot be reduced to questions of the State\u2019s existence, but rather extends to other matters such as a grave danger to ecological preservation,130 asserts that the fact that human life was endangered in the crisis under discussion justifies *a fortiori* the inclusion of this type of event under the terms of Article IV (3). The Respondent accordingly concludes that the invocation of necessity is not excluded by Article IV(3), so that the similar requirement envisaged by Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility is also met.\n\n*Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary/Slovakia), International Court of Justice, Judgment of September 25, 1997, para. 53.\n\n358.\n\nThe Respondent additionally relies in this regard on the expert report of Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter and Professor William Burke-White, who conclude that the measures adopted by Argentina are fully consistent with the terms of Article IV(3).131\n\nFirst Expert Opinion of Dean Slaughter and Professor Burke-White of July 19, 2005, paras. 85-86. See also Respondent\u2019s Counter-memorial, paras. 652-653.\n\n359.\n\nThe Claimant opposes this asserted justification on the ground that Article IV(3), far from reducing Argentina\u2019s obligations, adds to them by requiring national treatment and most favored nation treatment of the investors, as compared to the treatment given other companies in the light of the measures adopted to offset any losses. It is also argued that the decisions in *AMT* and *AAPL* upheld the liability of the host State despite situations of war and civil disturbance that were invoked under the provisions of the respectively applicable treaties.\n\n360.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, Article IV(3) applies only to measures adopted in response to a loss, such as those respecting compensation, and not to the measures that caused the loss. Moreover, the covered measures allegedly cannot apply to economic emergencies, but instead only to \"war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events.\" In any event, the Claimant concludes, this Article does not exempt Argentina from liability and the duty to pay compensation.\n\n361.\n\nThe Claimant relies upon the expert opinion of Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez in support of its arguments. Professor Alvarez has concluded that the Article in question provides additional assurances to foreign investors and is not \"a further exception permitting derogations from the treaty.\"132\n\nExpert Opinion of Professor Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez, September 12, 2005, para. 75.\n\n362.\n\nThe Tribunal must note that the only purpose of Article IV (3) is to provide for a minimum level of treatment for foreign investments that suffer losses in the host country by the simultaneous interplay of national and most favored nation treatments, and then only in respect of measures which the State \"adopts in relation to such losses,\" *i.e.,* corrective or compensatory measures.\n\n363.\n\nWhile there is no reason to exclude from this Article\u2019s scope economic emergency measures taken in circumstances of particular gravity, allowing for such inclusion would still not allow derogation from Treaty rights since the Article refers to a different matter. Even less so can the Article be read as a general escape clause from treaty obligations. It consequently does not result in the exclusion of wrongfulness, liability and eventual compensation. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that a state of necessity cannot be justified under this Article pursuant to the terms in which the Respondent has invoked it.\n\n*4. The plea of necessity under Article XI of the Treaty*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe discussion of Article XI of the Treaty has been particularly complex in this proceeding given the richness of the parties\u2019 arguments and the wealth of authorities and materials brought to the attention of the Tribunal. The Tribunal is once again grateful to the parties\u2019 counsel and to the experts who have written learned opinions. In particular, the Tribunal would like to recognize the contributions of Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter, Professor William Burke-White and Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez in this regard.\n\n365.\n\nArticle XI of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\n*This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfdlment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.*\n\n366.\n\nThe Respondent, relying on the opinion of Dean Slaughter and Professor Burke-White, asserts that public order and national security exceptions have to be interpreted broadly in the context of this Article so as to include considerations of economic security and political stability. Moreover, the Respondent\u2019s experts understand this Article to be self-judging insofar as each party will be the sole judge of when the situation requires measures of the kind envisaged by the Article, subject only to a determination of good faith by tribunals that might be called upon to settle a dispute on this point.133 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the gravity of the crisis that it faced amply justified resorting to such measures, which can only be considered as having been adopted in good faith.\n\nExpert Opinion of Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter and Professor William Burke-White of July 19, 2005, paras. 43-46.\n\n367.\n\nThe Respondent also explains that in applying this Article, Argentina has been able to maintain public order, protect its essential security interests and recompose with great difficulty its relations with the international economic system, all the while treating foreign investors like any other investor. The expert opinion of Dean Slaughter and Professor Burke-White emphasizes the view that measures can be adopted under Article XI to protect economic security and political stability, as well as classical military security.134\n\nExpert Opinion of Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter and Professor William Burke-White of July 19, 2005, paras. 47-55.\n\n368.\n\nThe Respondent assigns particular significance to the self-judging character of this Article, which the Respondent maintains has been reaffirmed by the interpretation given to the Article by the U.S. in a number of bilateral investment treaties and statements before Congress. The experts for the Respondent assert that \"[t]he U.S.-Argentina Bilateral Investment Treaty specifically allows the two states Parties to take measures that would otherwise be inconsistent with their treaty obligations when public order or national security is threatened.\"135\n\nExpert Opinion of Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter and Professor William Burke-White of July 19, 2005, para. 14.\n\n369.\n\nThe Claimant does not share this understanding, and neither does Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez. It is first argued that Article XI is not self-judging, and that judicial review is not limited to a good-faith determination, but instead has to examine the facts and whether they qualify under the requirements of a state of necessity. It is also maintained that a self-judging clause is an extraordinary exception that has to be clearly stated, as has been done in Article XXI of the GATT and confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the *Nicaragua* case in rejecting an argument of the U.S. similar to the one advanced here by Argentina. The Claimant notes that while such a clause has been expressly included in some bilateral investment treaties, most notably the U.S.-Russia BIT Protocol, nothing of the sort was done in the Treaty applicable here.\n\n370.\n\nProfessor Alvarez has summarized the conclusions of his expert opinion on the meaning of Article XI as being that this essential security and public order clause: \"(1) is not self-judging; (2) does not apply to \u2018economic emergencies\u2019, except in the most extraordinary and so far unprecedented circumstances; and (3) even when it does apply (for example, in the event of war or insurrection), is not the equivalent of a \u2018denial of benefits\u2019 or termination clause in a treaty, and so does not negate state responsibility to pay compensation for actions that harm investors.\"136\n\nExpert Opinion of Professor Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez September 12, 2005, para. 8.\n\n371.\n\nThe Claimant does not believe that exchanges undertaken between the U.S. Government and Congress in different contexts and to a very limited extent could be taken to mean that a self-judging interpretation was intended for the Treaty here applied.137 In fact, it is asserted that the opposite is true because the U.S. Government explained at the time that the Treaty \"contains an absolute right to international arbitration of investment disputes.\"138\n\nExpert Opinion of Professor Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez, September 12, 2005, para. 41.\n\nLetter of Submittal of the U.S. BIT, Januaryl3, 1993, Claimants' Exhibit 274\n\n372.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that Article XI does not in any event apply to economic emergencies, but rather only to internal security, just as international peace and security have been interpreted to mean the obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. Nor does the Claimant believe that Article XI relieves Argentina from the duty to pay compensation. A self-judging interpretation, the Claimant concludes, would result in the creation of a broad and sweeping exception to the obligations established under the Treaty, and would eviscerate the very object and purpose of this kind of treaty.139\n\nExpert Opinion of Professor Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez, September 12, 2005, para. 64.\n\n373.\n\nIn weighing this discussion, the Tribunal must first note that the object and purpose of the Treaty is, as a general proposition, for it to be applicable in situations of economic difficulty and hardship that require the protection of the internationally guaranteed rights of its beneficiaries. To this extent, any interpretation resulting in an escape route from the defined obligations cannot be easily reconciled with that object and purpose. Accordingly, a restrictive interpretation of any such alternative is mandatory.\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that there is nothing that would prevent an interpretation allowing for the inclusion of economic emergency in the context of Article XI. Essential security interests can eventually encompass situations other than the traditional military threats for which the institution found its origins in customary law. However, to conclude that such a determination is self-judging would definitely be inconsistent with the object and purpose noted. In fact, the Treaty would be deprived of any substantive meaning.\n\n375.\n\nIn addition, in view of the fact that the Treaty does not define what is to be understood by an \"essential security interest,\" the requirements for a state of necessity under customary international law, as outlined above in connection with their expression in Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, become relevant to the matter of establishing whether the necessary conditions have been met for its invocation under the Treaty. Different might have been the case if the Treaty had defined this concept and the conditions for its exercise, but this was not the case.\n\n376.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in the view of Dean Slaughter and Professor Burke-White, which the Respondent shares, the *CMS* award was mistaken in that it discussed Article XI in connection with necessity under customary law.140 This Tribunal believes, however, that the Treaty provision is inseparable from the customary law standard insofar as the definition of necessity and the conditions for its operation are concerned, given that it is under customary law that such elements have been defined. Similarly, the Treaty does not contain a definition concerning either the maintenance of international peace and security, or the conditions for its operation. Reference is instead made to the Charter of the United Nations in Article 6 of the Protocol to the Treaty.\n\nExpert Opinion of Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter and Professor William Burke-White of July 19, 2005, paras. 65-66, 68-72.\n\n377.\n\nThe expert opinion of Dean Slaughter and Professor Burke-White expresses the view that the treaty regime is different and separate from customary law as it is *lex* *specialis.*141 As Professor Burke-White explained at the hearing, the consequence of this approach is that while Article XI requires only a good faith determination, under customary law the whole panoply of requirements laid down in Article 25 of the Articles comes into play.142 Moreover, Professor Burke-White stated that the U.S. and Argentina had \"decided to accord investors greater protection than they would receive under customary international law, but simultaneously to guarantee to states, the States Parties greater protection to deal with threats to their national security.\"143\n\nExpert Opinion of Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter and Professor William Burke-White of July 19, 2005, para. 6.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor William Burke-White, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006, pp.1072-1073.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor William Burke-White, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006, p. 1068.\n\n378.\n\nIt is no doubt correct to conclude that a treaty regime specifically dealing with a given matter will prevail over more general rules of customary law. The problem here, however, is that the Treaty itself did not deal with the legal elements necessary for the legitimate invocation of a state of necessity. The rule governing such questions will thus be found under customary law. As concluded above, such requirements and conditions have not been fully met in this case. Moreover, the view of the Respondent\u2019s legal expert, as expressed at the hearing, contradicts the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Treaty standards are not more favorable than those of customary law, and at the most should be equated with the international minimum standard. The Tribunal does not believe that the intention of the parties can be described in the terms which the expert has used, as there is no indication that such was the case. Nor does the Tribunal believe that because Article XI did not make an express reference to customary law, this source of rights and obligations becomes inapplicable. International law is not a fragmented body of law as far as basic principles are concerned and necessity is no doubt one such basic principle.\n\n379.\n\nAs explained by Dean Slaughter, the U.S. position has been gradually evolving towards support for self-judging clauses in respect of national security interests, and some bilateral investment treaties reflect this change, albeit not all of them. Yet, this does not necessarily result in the conclusion that such was the intention of the parties in respect of the Treaty under consideration. Truly exceptional and extraordinary clauses, such as a self-judging provision, must be expressly drafted to reflect that intent, as otherwise there can well be a presumption that they do not have such meaning in view of their exceptional nature.\n\n380.\n\nIn the case of the Treaty, nothing was said in respect of a self-judging character, and the elements invoked in support of this view originate for the most part in U.S. Congressional discussions concerning broader issues, or in indirect interpretations arising mainly with respect to the eventual application of model investment treaties used by the U.S.144 The Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief has listed a number of discussions and statements which relate to the issue of a self-judging interpretation,145 but these items are contextual and do not specifically address the case of the Treaty in question.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor William Burke-White, Elearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006, pp. 1058-1062.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post Hearing Brief, para. 124.\n\n381.\n\nProfessor Burke-White also stated at the hearing that, in his understanding, the letter submitting the Treaty to the Argentine Congress did not say \"anything about it being self-judging, nor anything about it being non self-judging... this document does not speak to that issue.\"146 This expert also explained that while he had no evidence about the internal discussions within the Argentine Government as to the intent of the Treaty, there was such evidence in respect of the intent of the U.S. Government, and that given the \"reciprocal nature of the Treaty... the intent... would be for a self-judging interpretation of Article XI.\"147 This is, however, again a contextual interpretation that does not appear to meet the stricter requirements of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties in respect of treaty interpretation in the light of its context, or the resort to supplementary means of interpretation.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor William Burke-White, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006, p. 1100.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor William Burke-White, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006, at pp. 1101-1102.\n\n382.\n\nMore to the point is a letter sent by an official of the United States Department of State on September 15, 2006 to a former official asked to testily in the context of a different arbitration, which the Respondent brought to the attention of the Tribunal on June 25, 2007. In this letter, it is stated that \"notwithstanding the decision of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case, the position of the U. S. Government is that the essential security language in our FCN treaties and Bilateral Investment Treaties is self-judging, *i.e.,* only the party itself is competent to determine what is in its own essential security interests.\" The Respondent is of the view that this confirms the interpretation given by it of the Treaty in this case. The Claimant, however, has opposed this understanding on the argument that the letter refers to an interpretation supposedly adopted as from 2006 and that in any event it does not refer to the Treaty with Argentina nor does it preclude liability or compensation.\n\n383.\n\nThe discussion noted above concerning the GATT and the *Nicaragua* decision, just like the *Oil Platforms* case, confirms that the language of a provision has to be very precise for it to lead to a conclusion about its self-judging nature. In those decisions, the fact that the language was not express turned out to be crucial to the rejection of arguments favoring a self-judging interpretation. So too, the International Court of Justice held in the *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* case, when referring to the conditions defined by the International Law Commission, that \"the State concerned is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met.\"148\n\n*Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary/ Slovakia),Judgment of 25 September 1997, ICJ Reports/1997), paras. 51-52.\n\n384.\n\nThe Tribunal must also note that not even in the context of GATT Article XXI is the issue considered to be settled in favor of a self-judging interpretation, and the very fact that such article has not been excluded from dispute settlement is indicative of its non-self-judging nature.149\n\nM. Matsushita, T. J. Schoenbaum and P. Mavroidis: *The World Trade Organization,* 2006, at 594-598.\n\n385.\n\nThe same holds true of the U. S. Department of State letter referred to above in that it does not address any specific treaty, least that with Argentina. Furthermore, the fact that arbitration is the compulsory dispute settlement mechanism established in the Treaty in question, like with GATT/WTO, could be rather indicative of the non self-judging nature of the essential security interest clause. Not even if this is the interpretation given to the clause today by the United States would this necessarily mean that such an interpretation governs the Treaty. The view of one State does not make international law, even less so when such a view is ascertained only by indirect means of interpretation or in a rather remote or general way as far as the very Treaty at issue is concerned. What is relevant is the intention which both parties had in signing the Treaty, and this does not confirm the self-judging interpretation.\n\n386.\n\nMoreover, even if this interpretation were shared today by both parties to the Treaty, it still would not result in a change of its terms. States are of course free to amend the Treaty by consenting to another text, but this would not affect rights acquired under the Treaty by investors or other beneficiaries. In fact, Article XIV of the Treaty provides that in case of termination, the investment will continue to be protected under its provisions \"for a further period of ten years.\" So too, with reference to rights protected under the Energy Charter Treaty, the tribunal in *Plama* has held that any denial of advantages to which an investor might have rights \"should not have retrospective effect,\" as such a situation would result in making legitimate expectations false at a much later date.150\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24), Decision on Jurisdiction of February 8, 2005 para. 162.\n\n387.\n\nAs an English court has recently held in respect of a claim of non-justiciability relating to a State challenge to the *OEPC* award, the fact that a treaty is concluded between States cannot allow the derogation of rights that belong to private parties. In that case, the issue concerned dispute settlement, and as a consequence the doctrine of non-justiciability was held not to apply.151\n\n*Republic of Ecuador v. Occidental Exploration and Production Corporation,* English Commercial Court, Case No: 2004 FOLIO 656, judgment given on April 29, 2005, para. 85.\n\n388.\n\nIn the light of this discussion, the Tribunal concludes that Article XI is not self-judging and that judicial review is not limited in its respect to an examination of whether its invocation, or the measures adopted, were taken in good faith. The judicial control must be a substantive one, and concerned with whether the requirements under customary law or the Treaty have been met and can thereby preclude wrongfulness. Since the Tribunal has found above that the crisis invoked does not meet the customary law requirements of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, it concludes that necessity or emergency is not conducive in this case to the preclusion of wrongfulness, and that there is no need to undertake a further judicial review under Article XI given that this Article does not set out conditions different from customary law in such regard.\n\n389.\n\nA judicial determination as to compliance with the requirements of international law in this matter should not be understood as suggesting that arbitral tribunals wish to substitute their views for the functions of sovereign States. Such a ruling instead simply responds to the Tribunal\u2019s duty that, in applying international law, it cannot fail to give effect to legal commitments that are binding on the parties, and must interpret the rules accordingly unless a derogation of those commitments has been expressly agreed to.\n\n390.\n\nThe Tribunal explained above that it would consider the requirement of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, to the effect that the act in question not seriously impair an essential interest of the State towards which the obligation exists in the context of the Treaty obligations. In the light of the discussion above about changing interpretations, it does not appear that the Government\u2019s invocation of Article XI or of a state of necessity generally would be taken by the other party to mean that such impairment arises.\n\n391.\n\nBe that as it may, in the context of investment treaties there is still the need to take into consideration the interests of the private entities who are the ultimate beneficiaries of those obligations, as was explained by the English court in the *OEPC* case noted above. The essential interest of the Claimant would certainly be seriously impaired by the operation of Article XI or a state of necessity in this case.\n\n*5. Temporality and Compensation*\n---------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nThere are still two other aspects of the \"state of necessity\" which the Tribunal needs to discuss. There is first the question posed by necessity being a temporal condition and, as expressed in Article 27 of the Articles on State Responsibility, its invocation being without prejudice to \"(a) compliance with the obligation in question, if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists.\" This premise does not seem to be disputed by the parties, although the continuing extension of the emergency, discussed above, does not seem to be easily reconciled with the requirement of temporality. This in turn results in uncertainty as to what will be the legal consequences of the Emergency Law\u2019s conclusion.\n\n393.\n\nThe second question is posed by the fact that Article 27 also provides that necessity is without prejudice to \"(b) the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question.\" This other premise has been much debated by the parties, as noted above. The Respondent does not share this premise because the record shows that there would eventually be no compensation for past losses or adverse effects originating in the emergency measures, either in the context of the renegotiations undertaken or otherwise. As put by the Respondent\u2019s witness Mr. Simeonoff, \"[t]he answer is a single one. The Argentine State will not recognize any compensation for damages.\"152\n\nTestimony of Mr. Jorge Gustavo Simeonoff, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 2, February 7, 2006, p. 336.\n\n394.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s view appears to be based on the understanding that Article 27 would require compensation only for the damage arising after the emergency is over, and not for that taking place during the emergency period. Although that Article does not specify the circumstances in which compensation should be payable because of the range of possible scenarios, it has also been considered that this is a matter to be agreed with the affected party.153 The Article thus does not exclude the possibility of an eventual compensation for past events. The 2007 agreements between the Respondent and the Licensees appear to confirm this interpretation insofar as they cover, as noted, the period running from January 6, 2002 until the end of the License. This could mean that the tariff adjustment scheduled to begin on January 1, 2008 has been conceived as including past damages.\n\nJames Crawford: *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries,* (ed., Cambridge University Press) (2002), p. 190.\n\n395.\n\nThe question of compensation has been discussed at various points by the parties in the context of an eventual issue of double recovery resulting from, on the one hand, the compensation which the investor would receive as a result of arbitration and, on the other hand, the compensation which the company would receive in the context of a renegotiated adjustment of tariffs or some other mechanism. The Tribunal believes that this is actually not likely to since Government negotiators will make sure that any recovery obtained from one source is not duplicated by means of a separate recovery from another source. In answer to a question from the Tribunal with respect to the multiple possible sources of recovery, a company executive appearing as a witness for the Claimant explained at the hearing that \"these two sources are mutually exclusive, and I don\u2019t think there is any possibility for a double compensation to exist.\"154 This interpretation proved to be correct as the 2007 agreements with the Licensees, as explained, expressly envisage that the Respondent shall be kept free of any adverse consequences arising from compensation that the Claimant might obtain in this arbitration or other proceedings.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Martin Juan Blanquier, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 7, February 13, 2006, pp. 1367-1370.\n\n396.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that this discussion is related to the broader issue of whether crisis conditions should result in the lowering of standards set under treaties and investment law, to the benefit of the State. The question was extensively discussed at the hearing in connection with the expert statement of Professor W. Michael Reisman, who in the Respondent\u2019s understanding had minimized the importance of the crisis context for the operation of investment law standards, and who was criticized for it.155 The Respondent emphasized its view by showing a video on the Argentine crisis in 2001-2002. Professor Reisman explained in the context of this discussion that\n\n\"of course governments in these circumstances must take measures to restore public order, but from the investment *law* standpoint - and this is for the future of all investments - international investment law says you may do it, but you must pay compensation. If exceptions are made for like these or other circumstances, the entire purpose of modem investment law, which is to accelerate the movement of private funds into developing countries for development purposes, will be frustrated.\"156\n\nRemarks of Dr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006, pp. 1000-1009.\n\nExpert Statement of Professor W. Michael Reisman, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 6, February 11, 2006, p. 1007.\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal does not believe that the issue here is one of lowering the standards of protection set under the Treaty or the law. This being said, however, the manner in which the law has to be applied cannot ignore the realities resulting from a crisis situation, including how a crisis affects the normal functioning of any given society. This is the measure of justice that the Tribunal is bound to respect. The Tribunal will accordingly take into account the crisis conditions affecting Argentina when determining the compensation due for the liability found in connection with the breach of the Treaty standards.\n\n**D. Remedies**\n---------------\n\n398.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded above that the Respondent breached in this case Article 112(a) and (c) of the Treaty relating to fair and equitable treatment and the respect of obligations with regard to investments. There remains for the Tribunal to determine the compensation to be paid to the Claimant as a result of such breaches.\n\n399.\n\nIn this task, the Tribunal analyzed the reports and testimonies presented by the experts retained by each side, Dr. Manuel A. Abdala and Dr. Pablo T. Spiller of LECG, LLC (hereafter \"LECG\") for the Claimant, and Professor Diego J. Dzodan of the Universidad Torcuato Di Telia, for the Respondent. The Respondent also submitted a valuation report prepared by Mr. Juan Carlos Fassi, Director of PA Consulting Services S.A. and dated December 5, 2005. This report was supplemented by a letter of January 19, 2006 from Mr. Fassi providing answers to questions raised by the Claimant. During the course of the hearing on the merits, the Tribunal was informed, on February 9, 2006 that Mr. Fassi could not appear as a witness. By letter of February 15, 2006 to the parties, the Tribunal decided that, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Fassi could not be subjected to oral examination on his report by the parties and the Tribunal, his report would nonetheless be admitted in order to have the full view of the parties\u2019 position on the valuation of damages. In reaching its own conclusions on damages, the Tribunal gave careful consideration to the views expressed by Mr. Fassi in his expert report of December 5, 2005 and subsequent letter of January 19, 2006. The Tribunal was assisted by Dr. Luis Carlos Valenzuela, of Bogota, Colombia, who was appointed as expert by the Tribunal with the agreement of the parties, following the oral hearings in this case. Dr. Valenzuela produced two reports which were transmitted to the parties; their comments on each report were received by the Tribunal and given due consideration. The Tribunal wishes to express its appreciation to all the experts for their contribution.\n\n1. The Valuation Principle.\n---------------------------\n\n400.\n\nThe principles governing compensation under international law were well explained by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *C'horzow Factory Case* and have been developed in numerous decisions of international courts and tribunals. As the Permanent Court held in that case, \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"157\n\n*Chorz\u00f4w,* Judgment No. 13 (Claim for Indemnity - The Merits) of September 13, 1928, http://www.worldcourts.com/pcij/eng/decisions/1928.09.13\\_chorzowl/, para. 47.\n\n401.\n\nIn the absence of restitution or agreed renegotiation of contracts or other measures of redress, the appropriate standard of reparation under international law is compensation for the losses suffered by the affected party. The International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2002, also state in this respect that compensation is meant to cover any \"financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\"158\n\nArticles on State Responsibility, Article 36 (2).\n\n402.\n\nArticle IV of the Treaty establishes the standard for the determination of compensation. It states:\n\n*\"Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier; be paid without delay; include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation; be fully realizable; and be freely transferable at the prevailing market rate of exchange on the date of expropriation.\"*\n\n403.\n\nIt must be noted that this provision addresses specifically the case of expropriation which the Tribunal has concluded has not taken place in the present case. The Treaty does not specify the damages to which the investor is entitled in case of breach of the Treaty standards different from expropriation. Although there is some discussion about the appropriate standard applicable in such a situation, several awards of arbitral tribunals dealing with similar treaty clauses have considered that compensation is the appropriate standard of reparation in respect of breaches other than expropriation, particularly if such breaches cause significant disruption to the investment made.159 In such cases it might be very difficult to distinguish the breach of fair and equitable treatment from indirect expropriation or other forms of taking and it is thus reasonable that the standard of reparation might be the same.\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v.

In the present case, the Claimant made its investment in Argentina in 1996 and increased it over the years. The Tribunal is of the view that fair market value would be the most appropriate standard to apply in this case to establish the value of the losses, if any, suffered by the Claimant as a result of the Treaty breaches which occurred, by comparing the fair market value of the companies concerned with and without the measures adopted by Argentina in January 2002.\n\n405.\n\nAn internationally recognized definition of fair market value reads as follows:\n\n*\"(...) the price, expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which property would change hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and hypothetical and able seller, acting at arm\u2019s length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither is under compulsion to buy or sell and when both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.\"160*\n\nInternational Glossary of Business Valuation Terms, American Society of Appraisers, ASA website, June 6 2001, p. 4\n\n406.\n\nThe Claimant estimates that it has suffered damages to equity value in the amount of US$143.49MM. In addition, claims are made for historical (or discrete) damages concerning the U.S. PPI adjustment in the amount of US$9.86MM, subsidies in the amount of US$38.63MM and loss on a loan in the amount of US$17.4MM; these the Tribunal will consider separately. The total amount claimed by the investor in this arbitration is US$209.38MM.\n\n2. The Methodology Adopted.\n---------------------------\n\n407.\n\nBoth LECG and Professor Dzodan adopted Discounted Cash flow as an appropriate methodology but they followed different paths to arrive at their conclusions.\n\n408.\n\nProfessor Dzodan\u2019s model aims at determining whether CGP and CGS created or destroyed value for the Claimant during their useful life, on the basis of the return established under the appropriate Argentine regulation. This implies calculating whether or not CGP and CGS achieved economic equilibrium. For this purpose, that model calculates:\n\n\u2022 The present value of future free cash flow from 2005 to 2027 under the actual conditions prevailing in Argentina during that period (\"the pesification scenario\").\n\n\u2022 The compounded value of historical free cash flow from 1992 to 2004.\n\n\u2022 The compounded value in 2004 of the Claimant\u2019s investments in CGP and CGS from 1992 to 2004.\n\n409.\n\nThe value created or destroyed is established by adding the two values of cash flows measured in 2004, from which the compounded value in 1994 of the original investments is subtracted (or Value created/destroyed =A+B-C).\n\n410.\n\nAccording to Professor Dzodan, in so far as the positive cash flows are equal or superior to the negative ones, or to the realized investments, there is no reason to award compensation since the investment is recoverable, even with the effects of the measures adopted by Argentina.\n\n411.\n\nLECG, on the other hand, aims at establishing the damages suffered by the Claimant as a result of the measures adopted by Argentina in the following manner:\n\n\u2022 It first makes an individual evaluation of the historical damages suffered by CGS and CGP as a consequence of the non-application of the U.S. PPI adjustments to the tariffs, the non-payment of subsidies owing to them under the License, and the reduction of income they suffered from the implementation of taxes which were not translated into tariff increases.\n\n\u2022 It then establishes the discounted cash flow value of the companies in the context of the pesification scenario following the adoption by Argentina of the measures complained of.\n\n\u2022 Finally, by utilizing discounted cash flow and book value, it establishes the value of the firms in the context where the spirit of the original contractual conditions would have been maintained for the duration of the License (\"the but-for scenario\").\n\n412.\n\nThe damages suffered are then arrived at by first stating the value of the firms under the but-for scenario, from which the value under the pesification scenario is subtracted and the value of the historical damages is added (or Damages = C-B+A).\n\n413.\n\nThe Tribunal has come to the conclusion that, without contesting its economic validity per se, the model proposed by Professor Dzodan does not represent an adequate instrument to establish the level of compensation which may be due to a party under the Treaty, the License and the ENARGAS regulations. The problem at hand under the Treaty and the License is not to judge whether the companies have been fairly remunerated in the past but to determine what they were worth in 2001 given their prospects over the remaining years of the licenses. International legal standards governing compensation do not normally consider past earnings to determine compensation due.\n\n414.\n\nIn light of this conclusion, the Tribunal does not need to address a certain number of criticisms raised by the Claimant\u2019s and the Tribunal\u2019s experts against some of the assumptions made in Professor Dzodan\u2019s report.\n\n415.\n\nOn the other hand, the LECG model appears to the Tribunal to be more appropriate since it differentiates between the various alleged breaches thus allowing for a closer analysis of the nature of such breaches and, thereby, the value of the damages suffered.\n\n3. Damages valuation at December 31, 2001 (but-for scenario)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore pursue its analysis of damages valuation by basing itself on the DCF model proposed by LECG. The Tribunal, however, wishes to discuss further the following factors under the model proposed by LECG\n\n\u2022 The asset base\n\n\u2022 The discount rate under the but-for scenario.\n\n\u2022 The tariff increases that would have been approved under the but-for scenario.\n\n\u2022 The consumption effect under the but-for scenario.\n\n417.\n\nThese various factors are open to discussion in view of the likely effect of the economic crisis affecting Argentina at the time on the business prospects. The Tribunal has held above that there was quite evidently a major crisis in Argentina and while this crisis does not excuse the wrongfulness of the measures taken in respect of the investment, it does have an incidence on the issue of valuation and compensation.\n\na) The Asset Base\n-----------------\n\n418.\n\nA major factor which ENARGAS had to consider in establishing the tariffs of gas distribution companies on the occasion of its Second Quinquennial Tariff Review (\"RQT II\") was the asset base of the companies concerned.\n\n419.\n\nAs part of that process, ENARGAS received in December 2002 an Interagency Report.161 This report included the results of a study it requested from an independent private consulting firm (PSI) to provide figures for the CGP and CGS asset bases as of December 2000, for the purposes of the RQT II. Those asset bases were significantly lower than those proposed by the Claimant. In fact, while the Claimant indicated an asset base for regulatory purposes of US$461.72 MM for CGP and an asset base of US$241.19MM for CGS, the PSI consultants suggested reductions of AR$ 65.2MM (parity) pesos for CGP and AR$ 44.6MM (parity) pesos for CGS.162\n\nENARGAS \u00abInteragency Report\u00bb *(Informe Interagencial)* of December 2002, Annex 1(a), p.86.\n\nIbid., Annex 1(a), p. 86.\n\n420.\n\nThe Claimant has argued that the asset bases arrived at by PSI were not final and were only the first step towards the calculation of the companies\u2019 approved asset base. According to the Claimant, ENARGAS still had to apply the U.S. PPI adjustments and consider other relevant factors, including the efficient levels of working capital and the companies\u2019 views on the potential disallowances.\n\n421.\n\nLECG submitted a Reconciliation of the 2000 Asset Base, which included adjustments for working capital disallowances and for PPI, which led to a PSI decrease in asset base of only 3.4% for CGP and 5.8% for CGS compared to the Claimant\u2019s proposed asset base. In addition, in bringing that asset base valuation to December 2001, the Claimant argued that it is necessary to add the actual 2001 investments (minus depreciation), look at efficient working capital variations, and adjust all figures by the U.S. PPI.\n\n422.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that, under the but-for scenario, ENARGAS would have had to include a proper PPI adjustment. However, it would be extremely hard to believe that, under the macroeconomic conditions that Argentina faced at the end of 2001 and in 2002, ENARGAS would not have adopted the reductions in asset base recommended by PSI.\n\n423.\n\nAs to the working capital disallowances adjustments suggested by the Claimant (US$21.10M for CGP and US$14.00M for CGS for the 2000 Asset Base), it is most likely that ENARGAS would have rejected them. Indeed, the financial statements of CGP and CGS show clearly that both companies usually had a negative working capital in normal years.\n\n424.\n\nThis is indeed the case under the classical definition of working capital (that is the difference between all current assets and all current liabilities), as shown by the 1999 and 2000 financial statements of CGP; the same conclusion is reached for CGS, once adjustments are made for unpaid subsidies. It is usually considered more informative to study the non-cash *(i.e.* disregarding cash reserves and short term debt) operations-related capital and to remove anything which might be doubtful or temporary; using that formula, the absolute numbers change but the working capital remains negative. This would appear to be due in large part to the fact that, in normal years, the gas consumers paid their bills faster than the distributors paid the transportation companies (32 or 33 days compared with 42 or 45 days for each company).\n\n425.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, ENARGAS would have had valid grounds in the circumstances of this case, which deals with distribution companies, to refuse an amount for working capital in arriving at the asset base. The same conclusion should apply to 2001 as well.\n\n426.\n\nIt is therefore appropriate, in the case of CGP, to deduct from the 2000 asset base of US$461.72MM proposed by the Claimant the negative adjustments of US$65.2MM (parity pesos) recommended by PSI and to add the adjustment for PPI of US$28.32MM. In the case of CGS, it is necessary to deduct from the asset base of US$241.19MM. proposed by the Claimant, the negative adjustments of US$44.6MM. proposed by PSI and to add the PPI adjustment of US$16.16MM. Using the table contained in the Claimant\u2019s letter of 18 December 2006, the adjusted asset base of CGP goes down from US$461.72MM to US$424.85MM, on December 31, 2000. Applying the same reasoning to CGS lowers the asset base from US$241.19MM to US$212.75 MM at that date.\n\n427.\n\nHowever, it is still necessary to bring those figures up to 31 December 2001, by applying the 2001 U.S. PPI change of -5.84% to the 2000 asset base and by adding the actual investments (US$20.03MM for CGP and US$20.57MM for CGS) minus depreciation (US$0.94MM for CGP and US$0.67MM for CGS).\n\n428.\n\nThe total amount of the asset base at December 31, 2001 is accordingly US$419.13MM for CGP and US$220.23 MM for CGS.\n\nb) The But-For Scenario Discount Rate\n-------------------------------------\n\n429.\n\nIn all probability, ENARGAS would have considered in its tariffs reviews that distribution is a riskier business than transportation. This conclusion is reasonable in the instant case in the light of the difficulties Argentina faced, since distribution is closer to the final consumer and the latter is more likely to be late or to default on payments than the distributor itself. Further, the transportation company can usually get some form of protection from demand variation through take-or-pay contracts. It is thus also reasonable that the cost of equity (\"COE\") for CGP and CGS be larger than for a transportation company. In fact, this is the exact conclusion which ENARGAS arrived at in its Notes of November 21, 2001 where it mentions that it was proposing to establish the WACC at a level 1.7% higher for gas distribution than for gas transportation, effective the first semester of 2003.163\n\nENARGAS Notes 5498 of November 2001 (p. 31) to CGP and CGS, produced by the Claimant on December 18, 2006 pursuant to a December 12, 2006 request to the parties by the Tribunal for additional information relating to RQT II.\n\n430.\n\nAs to the cost of equity, it was established by ENARGAS at 15.56% after the first quinquennial review of 1997 and this was the figure adopted by Professor Dzodan in his report of 15 January 2006.164 As to the experts for the Claimant, they chose a slightly higher COE of 16.28% (yielding a WACC of 13.77%) for CGP and 16.75% (yielding a WACC of 14.12%) for CGS. The same WACC for both valuations (but-for and pesification scenarios) was used.\n\nAnalysis of SEMPRA and CAMUZZI\u2019s return on their investments in CGS and CGP, 15 January 2006, pp.7-8.\n\n431.\n\nGiven the fact that the parties arrive at relatively similar figures and bearing in mind the historical cost of equity, for CGP and CGS between 1992 and 2001 varied between some 16 and 22% according to the Claimant's experts, the Tribunal believes that the COE rates proposed by the Claimant are reasonable and should be retained for both the but-for and the pesification scenario. It could even be thought that the COE should have been larger under the pesification scenario to reflect the greater uncertainty in the new regulatory context; this would have further reduced the value of the firms under the pesification scenario and increased the damages suffered by the Claimant.\n\n432.\n\nIn the context of some of the expert reports before the Tribunal, high discount rates were also envisaged as a consequence of the premium on Government bonds being very high at the end of December 2001 because these bonds were in default at that time and as a consequence they could only sell at a deep discount, if at all. However, the Tribunal believes that the case of CGP and CGS is different.\n\n433.\n\nIn fact, there is first a difference between the Argentine government's credit risk and the country risk. It has been clearly established before the Tribunal that, even in the latter part of 2001, the country risk premium required by an investor in a private company in Argentina was significantly lower than the Government\u2019s credit risk premium during the same period. The difference was even more significant in the case of energy companies like CGP and CGS, because of their regulated status and their relatively lower business risk.\n\n434.\n\nNext, if the regulatory framework would have been maintained (no pesification of tariffs, no suspension of the PPI adjustment and other elements, or, in the alternative, pesification but with preservation of the allowed rate of return on the U.S. dollar value of assets), the companies would not have suffered the strong impact of the crisis in its entirety, their bonds would have kept trading at a better rate than the Government\u2019s bonds (as was the case even before the crisis), and their future would not have appeared compromised, especially over a long period of time extending to 2027. Discounting so many years at a very large rate implies that Argentina, and CGP and CGS with it, would have remained in a state of economic dislocation and that maintaining the initial tariff conditions would have served no purpose at all.\n\n435.\n\nHad CGP and CGS (or Sodigas) hypothetically decided, at the end of 2001, to sell their shares on the Argentine exchange (in fact, none of them were listed), they might very well have suffered from the adverse reactions engendered by the state of economic and political difficulties. In other words, investors might very well have applied an extremely high discount rate and undervalued the equity. But the Claimant had originally not invested in CGP and CGS for trading purposes. It invested for the long term. Therefore, an unusually high market discount should not be included in the valuation of a long term investment, on the basis of a serious but temporary economic crisis.\n\n436.\n\nThis conclusion does not mean that, under the but-for scenario, CGP and CGS would have merrily sailed through the major economic crisis which Argentina suffered and brought home large returns on equity, as if nothing had ever happened. In particular, the Tribunal is of the view that CGP and CGS would have been called upon to shoulder some of the burden of the general economic crisis and might have been faced with the need to reduce some of the increases to which they might otherwise have felt they were entitled to; moreover, and in a significant way under the but-for scenario, gas consumption and tariff rates would have been significantly impacted, with the consequent results on the value of the firm.\n\n437.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore proceed to discuss projected tariff changes and projected consumption.\n\nc) The Tariff Changes under the But-For Scenario\n------------------------------------------------\n\n438.\n\nOne of the most crucial and debatable assumption is the peso tariff increase assumed by the Claimant to take place in 2002.\n\n439.\n\nThe Claimant estimates increases of 147% (for CGP) (53% blended) and 139% (for CGS) (49% blended) for the distribution component (without a similar increase in transportation tariff and an increase in the price of gas being postponed to 2005 in the case of CGP and 2004 in the case of CGS). The result is that, at least until 2004, the income of those companies would have increased, but their costs would have been kept much lower, a fact which is considered most unlikely. This assumption is particularly unreasonable when one considers the transportation component which is covered by the same regulatory framework as the distribution component and is affected by the same macroeconomic conditions.\n\n440.\n\nUnder the Claimant\u2019s assumptions, the EBITDA in Argentine pesos increases, between 2001 and 2002, by 272% for CGP and 270% for CGS. This increase is even higher than the increase in the exchange rate during the same period.\n\n441.\n\nThe political and economic viability of such a situation would have been practically nil in the actual context of the Argentine economy at the time. In fact, a 49% (CGS) or 53% (CGP) blended tariff increase in 2002 (in its post-hearing brief, the Claimant mentions 61% for CGP and 58% for CGS) would have been out of the question from the point of view of consumers. The Argentinean currency having lost 2/3 of its international purchasing power, the cost of many items had all of a sudden become much higher and Argentineans were suffering the consequences. Bank deposits had been forcibly converted to pesos and partly frozen, and unemployment and inflation were high. It is quite evident that 147% and 139% increases in the distribution component of the tariff would have been impossible. But even a possible smaller increase cannot be looked at in isolation from the other increases, implicit or explicit. It is realistic to think that the Government would not have added fuel to citizens\u2019 discontent, nor to inflation.\n\n442.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal believes that, taking into account the state of the Argentine economy since 2002, it is most unlikely that, even by spreading the requested 147% and 139% increases in the distribution components over a period of years, it would have been possible to fully implement such an increase. It is true that, with the reduced asset base established above by the Tribunal, those increases become 128.43% for CGP and 131.92% for CGS. But these remain very large increases indeed. In the context of the economic crisis at the time, the Tribunal considers inevitable that the Claimant would have been called upon to carry part of the burden of that crisis.\n\n443.\n\nIn that regard, the Tribunal considers as reasonable the following measures that might have been taken by ENARGAS at that time:\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal has already indicated the significant downward adjustments that would have been made to the asset base by ENARGAS on the occasion of RQT II, resulting in a reduction of the allowable tariff increases.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal is also of the view that, in the economic context of 2001-2002, ENARGAS would have been entitled to further reduce the tariff increase by recognizing no more than 85% of the allowable increases, thus producing a tariff increase of 109.17% (85% of 128.43%) for CGP and 112.13% (85% of 131.92%) for CGS.\n\n\u2022 That increase would not have taken place in a single shot in 2002 but would have been spread over a five-year period, corresponding to the regular quinquennial review envisaged under the License, but with a 0% end-user blended tariff increase in 2002.\n\n\u2022 In addition, the Tribunal finds it inconceivable that ENARGAS would have granted a large increase to the gas distribution sector while the tariffs in transportation sector would have remained flat. In its analysis of the impact of tariff changes, the Tribunal will assume that equal increases would have been granted to the transportation sector. This would increase further the level of the blended tariff for the gas distribution clients and, because of its impact on price elasticity, would reduce consumption of natural gas, and hence the revenues of the gas distributors.\n\n444.\n\nThe changes in consumption considered are not the result of a sophisticated equation but of a reasonable estimate. Prudence also suggests that decreases in consumption are shifted one-year forward compared with tariff increases.\n\n445.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore arrives at the following end-user tariff average variation starting in year 2002 in the case of CGP: 0.0%, 11.9%, 18.5%, 24.9%, 24.4%, 26.9%, 3.7%, 3.4%, 3.3%, 2.9%, 1.2% and then 2.4% per year until 2027 (with the distribution and transportation component increasing by 2% per year starting in 2007, as forecasted by LECG). In the case of CGS, the figures are respectively: 0.0%, 10.2%, 15.8%, 21.3%, 43.1%, 21.4%, 3.7%, 3.4%, 3.2%, 2.8%, 1.9% and then around 2.4% until 2027 (with the distribution and transportation component growing by 2% per year starting in 2007, as forecasted by LECG). These increases in average end-user tariff factor in the changes in the price of gas forecasted by LECG.\n\nd) Consumption Adjustments under the But-For Scenario\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n446.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s experts based their estimates on some low price elasticities computed by an independent organization. It is to be noted, however, that low price elasticities are valid only for relatively modest increases in a given economic context. These experts also argue that elasticity is very low because the majority of the natural gas sold by CGP and CGS is for industrial and commercial users. While this is true in terms of volume, it is the residential consumers who represent the largest income component because of the higher profit margin in the latter case. It is therefore not possible to retain the argument that income will not be affected because the largest share of volume of gas is consumed by industrial and commercial users.\n\n447.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that the elasticities used by these experts were not realistic in the context of the large immediate tariff increase proposed by the Claimant for the distribution component of the tariff. Moreover, in the Claimant\u2019s scenario, no increase at all is provided for gas transportation before 2006; in addition, there is no increase in the price of natural gas until 2005 in the case of CGP and there is an actual significant decrease until 2004 in the case of CGS. A more plausible scenario is one where at least gas transportation would gain the same increase as gas distribution (with 0% increase in the price of gas); in such a scenario the blended overall tariff increase would have been around 90%.\n\n448.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that there was either no alternative source of energy or that, if it existed, gas, even with large price increases, would have remained competitive. There is little doubt in the Tribunal\u2019s mind that gas consumption, at such but-for scenario prices, would have been likely to decrease in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors during the first years following 2001 or CGP and CGS would have been faced with a serious increase in defaulting payments.\n\n449.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, taking into account the tariff changes just mentioned, it is reasonable to assume the following combined (across customers) price elasticities for CGP: -0.2 in 2004, -0.25 in 2005, -0.3 in 2006, 2007 and 2008, with the resulting consumption changes: 0% in 2002 and 2003, -2.4% in 2004, -4.6% in 2005, -7.5% in 2006, -7.3% in 2007, -8.1% in 2008, 0.0% in 2009 and 2010, +1.0% in 2011 and 2.0% until 2027. As to CGS, the figures are respectively for price elasticities: -0.15 for 2004 and 2005, -0.2 in 2006, -0.25 in 2007 and -0.15 in 2008; as to consumption changes, the figures are : 0.0% in 2002 and 2003, -1.5% in 2004, -2.4% in 2005, -4.3% in 2006, -10.8% in 2007, -3.2% in 2008, 0.0% in 2009, 1.0% in 2010 and 2.0% in the following years up to 2027.\n\n450.\n\nThe net result of the above changes is that, under the but-for scenario, the equity value of CGP is US$168,240,220, and that of CGS is US$33,434,238.\n\n4. Valuation in the Pesification Scenario\n-----------------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nThe Tribunal, during its first consideration of the pesification scenario, was inclined to endorse the one proposed by the Claimant. However, events intervened subsequently to the hearings and the post-hearings briefs submitted by the parties, which led the Tribunal to accept amendments to that scenario.\n\n452.\n\nThese events are related in particular to the Agreements which the Respondent signed with the Licensees in 2007, noted further above. In fact, by letters of May 2 and June 29 2007, Argentina informed the Tribunal that on April 26, 2007, CGS and CGP had signed with Argentina Memorandums of Understanding for the Adjustment of License Agreement for Distribution of Natural Gas (\"MOU\").\n\n453.\n\nIt was also explained above that this MOU provides for a 25% increase in tariff for the transportation and distribution of natural gas; an additional 2% increase is subject to the implementation of certain investments. These increases were due to come into effect on July 1, 2007 for CGS and on January 1, 2008 for CGP. In addition, the MOU contains an indexation formula for the future based on a mechanism of monitoring of costs (\"MMC\") in the Argentinean economy.\n\n454.\n\nIt is important to recall that the MOU is however subject to a number of restrictions and conditions, including the abandonment of all arbitral or judicial claims by the Licensees or their shareholders relating to the pre-2002 regime governing gas distribution or transportation. In addition, certain categories of residences classified as Rl, R2 and R3 are protected from tariff increases until the adoption of an Integral Tariff Review to take place at a later time. Finally, the average total tariff increase cannot exceed 15%, taking into account adjustments to the price of gas.\n\n455.\n\nBy letters of June 25 and July 6 2007, Sempra informed the Tribunal that it would not sign any release or discharge in favor of Argentina of any liability in relation to the events which are the subjects of this case and that it persisted in its claims in this arbitration. It also mentioned that it had initiated proceedings against the shareholders of the companies that had approved and signed the MOU; such proceedings however are, as noted, outside the purview of this Tribunal.\n\n456.\n\nNotwithstanding the conditional, and even litigious, character of the MOU, the Tribunal agrees with Argentina that this is a development that the Tribunal should take into account in assessing the pesification (or \"actual\") scenario as it prompts objective consequences for the Licensees and consequently for the interests of the Claimant.\n\n457.\n\nFor instance, the first scenario proposed by the Claimant contained CPI tariff increases between 2002 and 2007 which did not materialize, but did not contain the increases now proposed by Argentina. It is quite appropriate in the circumstances to refer to the real situation as it stands today when considering the actual scenario. The MOU proposes adjustments to the pesification scenario which Argentina (albeit with certain conditions) is willing to implement in relation to the companies concerned in this case.\n\n458.\n\nThe Tribunal has therefore accepted the adjustments to the original pesification scenario, such as presented by the Claimant in its letter of July 6, 2007. In particular, the CPI indexation suggested in that scenario between 2002 and July 1, 2007 for CGS and January 1, 2008 for CGP has been removed as it did not materialize. However, from those respective latter dates, the proposed 27% tariff increase (taking into account a maximum 15% average increase in consumer price, including the price of gas) has been inserted for each company. In addition, as recognized by the Claimant in its letter of July 6, 2007, significant pesification gains of US$27,700,367 and U.S$ 12,014,617 have been made on the debts of CGS and CGP respectively and those have been taken into account in establishing the equity value loss of those companies. The cash flows are discounted with WAACs of 13.77% and 14.12% for CGP and CGS respectively.\n\n459.\n\nThe result is an estimated equity value of US$21,510,284 for CGP and -US$58,030,252 for CGS (in practice 0 for the shareholders and the rest affecting the creditors).\n\n5. The Equity Value Loss\n------------------------\n\n460.\n\nThe total equity value loss in the case of CGP is thus in the amount of US$146,729,936 and in the case of CGS of US$33,434,238.\n\n461.\n\nThe share of equity belonging to the Claimant being 37.10% in CGP and 38.78% in CGS, its damages for equity value loss amount to US$54,436,806 for CGP and US$12,965,797 for CGS, for a total of US$67,402,603.\n\n6. The loss on the Loan\n-----------------------\n\n462.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that the Claimant was entitled to claim in this case for the value of the loss on the loan granted in December 2001.\n\n463.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal needs only to concentrate on the pesification scenario, the question being to determine whether the debt of CGS and CGP could have been reimbursed in those conditions.\n\n464.\n\nIn fact, the problem arises only for CGS for as it has been explained CGP has a positive equity value; this means that its debt will have been reimbursed in full during the duration of the License and there will still be some money left for the shareholders. For CGS, however, the situation is quite different, the firm having a large negative equity value.\n\n465.\n\nIn December 2001, the Claimant and Camuzzi loaned US$56,017,000 and US$73,983,000 respectively to the Licensees, which totaled US$130,000,000 (Sempra therefore providing 43.1% and Camuzzi 56.9% of the loan). Of that amount US$50,812,056 went to CGS, which represented 63.77% of the net debt of the company. Consequently, the combined loss for Sempra and Camuzzi is that same percentage out of the negative equity value of US$58,030,252, that is US$37,005,892 (63.77% x 58,030,252).\n\n466.\n\nIn the case of the Claimant, as creditor of 43.1% of the loan, this loss represents a sum of US$15,949,540.\n\n7. Historical Damages\n---------------------\n\na) PPI Adjustments\n------------------\n\n467.\n\nThe Claimant is entitled to the payment of the PPI adjustments which were suspended and not allowed to them in 2000 and 2001.\n\n468.\n\nIn its expert report submitted by the Claimant, LECG has valued those damages, as at December 31, 2001, at US$15,746,004 for CGP and US$10,339,626 for CGS, for a total of US$26,085,630. In its closing statement, the Claimant has reduced that total amount to US$13.6MM for CGP and US$9.3MM for CGS, for a total of US$22.9MM. The Respondent has not challenged the validity of those latter figures and this is the amount that the Tribunal will retain for the purpose of assessing damages under this section.\n\n469.\n\nThe 37.10% held by the Claimant in CGP represents US$5,045,600 and its 38.78% share of CGS comes to US$3,606,540. The total amount therefore awarded to the Claimant as compensation for its share of unpaid PPI adjustments before December 31, 2001 amounts to a total of US$8,652,140.\n\nb) Non-Payment of Subsidies\n---------------------------\n\n470.\n\nIn the Subsidies Agreement of December 12, 2001, the parties agreed that, at October 31, 2001 an amount of AR$ 108,151,227.73 (including interest) was due for non-payment of subsidies but such amount does not include any amount for November and December.\n\n471.\n\nIn its closing statement document, the Claimant indicated that a sum of US$106.5 MM was owing as of September 2001, another US$17.3 MM up to December 31 and then US$5.4MM from January 1, 2002 to April 2002 (using currency parity under the Convertibility Law).\n\n472.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that damages would be established as at December 31, 2001. Damages in all cases are therefore determined as at that time, after which time the pesification and the but-for scenarios are applied. In both cases, it is assumed that, after that date, the tariffs will have been implemented fully one way or the other. The amounts of subsidies not paid between January and April 2002 should therefore be ignored for the purpose of calculating the compensation under this category.\n\n473.\n\nThe claim for unpaid subsidies will therefore only cover the period finishing on December 31, 2001. That amount has been established by the Claimant, in its Post-Hearing Brief, as of April 2002, at US$129, 187, 344 (as indicated a deduction of US$5.4 MM must be made for the January-April 2002 period).\n\n474.\n\nFrom that amount, the subsidies the Respondent paid or committed to pay subsequently to that date must also be deducted.\n\n475.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent argues that the amount owing should be in AR$ and not US$ and that most of that debt has already been repaid. On the basis of this assumption, the Respondent estimates that there would be only a remaining amount of some US$3 million to be paid to the Claimant.\n\n476.\n\nIn answer, the Claimant recognizes that a certain amount has been received but that it is very far from covering the total amount of unpaid subsidies. The difference between the Parties is explainable by the fact that Argentina argues that, since the subsidies were to be paid in pesos, whatever amount it paid subsequently in that currency should be deducted from the peso debt for unpaid subsidies, while the Claimant argues that, by virtue of the principle of indifference, the amount owed by the Respondent should be calculated on the basis of parity between the two currencies which was in effect at the time the debt was incurred.\n\n477.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided, for the reasons mentioned, that the unpaid subsidies before December 31, 2001, although established in pesos, should be paid on the basis of parity between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar. It will therefore proceed to calculate the amount still owed by Argentina on that basis.\n\n478.\n\nThe unpaid subsidies to December 31, 2001 shall be in the amount of US$123,787,344, leaving aside the US$5.4 MM claimed for the subsequent period up to April 2002. From that amount the sum of US$16,775,249 paid by Argentina up to January 2006 should be deducted. If it is assumed that all the amounts provided for under the Fiduciary Fund are going to be paid fully to the end of 2008 (on a currency parity basis, *i.e.* US$13,030,012 for the period of January 2006 to the end of 2008) - the Claimant itself has assumed that such payments would be made - the total amount owing for subsidies as of December 31, 2001 becomes US$93,982,083. Applying the same percentages as the ones mentioned by the Claimant for the allocation of that amount between CGP (1.13%) and CGS (98.37%), the unpaid subsidies therefore amount to US$1,061,998 in the case of CGP and US$92,450,175 in the case of CGS.\n\n479.\n\nThis is the amount which is awarded by the Tribunal as damages for unpaid subsidies. The Claimant is entitled to payment of its proportionate share of that amount, as represented by the respective interests of Sempra and Camuzzi in CGP and GGS. This amounts for the Claimant to US$394,001 in the case of CGP (corresponding to the Claimant\u2019s share of 37.10%) and US$35,852,178 in the case of CGS (corresponding to the Claimant\u2019s share of 38.78%). The total amount owing to the Claimant under this item is therefore US$36,246,179.\n\n480.\n\nIf, for any reason, the Respondent were not to implement in full the commitments it made under the Fiduciary Fund, such pending payments must be added to the amount awarded by the Tribunal.\n\nc) Other Discrete Claims\n------------------------\n\n481.\n\nIn its Memorial on the Merits, the Claimant had made a number of claims relating to various taxation matters. As noted, however, subsequently the Claimant decided not to pursue those claims and, consequently, the Tribunal does not need to address them.\n\n8. Total Damages\n----------------\n\n482.\n\nThe total damages due by the Respondent to the Claimant, as at December 31, 2001, amount to US$128,250,462.\n\nSempra Damages\n\nEquity value loss US$67,402,603\n\nLoss on the loan of December 2001 US$15,949,540\n\nUnpaid PPI adjustments US$8,652,140\n\nNon-Payment of subsidies US$36,246,179\n\nTotal damages at 31/12/2001 US$128,250,462\n\n9. Interest\n-----------\n\n483.\n\nIn its Consolidated Memorial on the Merits and in its Reply, the Claimant, in its prayer for relief requests \"(a)n order that the Argentine Republic compensate Camuzzi and Sempra for all damages they have suffered, plus interest compounded quarterly.\"\n\n484.\n\nIn the light of the recent Award in the *Enron* claim, this request became another contentious point in this arbitration. In *Enron,* the Tribunal decided that interests would be ordered until the date of the Award only as it understood that this was the request made by the Claimants.165 The Claimant brought that issue to the attention of this Tribunal and argued by letter of June 22, 2007 that post Award interest be also awarded. Argentina expressed opposition to this request by letter of July 2, 2007 on the ground that such request had not been timely made nor had it been made in the memorials or the *Petitum,* which on the contrary referred to interest until the date of the Award.\n\n*Enron Corp, and Ponderosa Assets, L. P. v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case ARB/01/3), Award of May 22, 2007, para. 452.\n\n485.\n\nIn considering this issue the Tribunal has unanimously concluded that it is appropriate for interest to begin on January 1, 2002. Yet, the Tribunal by majority has concluded that in the light of the fact that post Award interest was not expressly requested in the memorials or their *Petitum,* and such memorials repeatedly referred to interest until the date of the Award, interest should, like in *Enron,* be awarded only until the date of the Award. In the view of the majority formal petitions for relief can only be made in the *Petitum* and the memorials which explain and support such petitions. The Tribunal will accordingly order interest until the date of the Award.\n\n486.\n\nThe Tribunal also unanimously agreed that interest on the above-noted amounts of damages will be computed at the successive 6-month LIBOR rates, plus a 2% annualized premium or portion thereof. Interest shall be compounded semi-annually.\n\nNOW THEREFORE THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL DECIDES AND AWARDS AS FOLLOWS\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. The Respondent breached its obligations to accord the investor the fair and equitable treatment guaranteed in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty and to observe the obligations entered into with regard to the investment guaranteed in Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n2. The Respondent shall pay the Claimant compensation in the amount of US$128,250,462. If the Respondent were not to implement in full the commitments it made under the Fiduciary Fund for the payment of owed subsidies, such pending payments shall be added to the amount awarded by the Tribunal.\n\n3. The Respondent shall pay the Claimant interest at the 6 month successive LIBOR rate plus 2 per cent for each year, or proportion thereof, beginning on January 1, 2002 until the date of the Award. Interest shall be compounded semiannually.\n\n4. The Tribunal hereby confirms its Order that the Stamp Tax Claims are discontinued subject to the terms therein specified.\n\n5. Each party shall pay one half of the costs of the arbitration and bear its own legal costs.\n\n6. All other claims are hereby dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules)", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2009-03-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 25 January 2008, the Argentine Republic (Argentina) filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) an application (the Application for Annulment) requesting annulment of the Award of 28 September 2007 (the Award), rendered by the tribunal (the Tribunal) in the arbitration proceeding between Sempra Energy International (Sempra) and Argentina (together the Parties).\n\n2.\n\nThe Application for Annulment was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the ICSID Convention or Convention).\n\n3.\n\nIn the Application for Annulment, Argentina has sought annulment of the Award on the following grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically claiming that:\n\n(a) The Tribunal was not properly constituted (ICSID Convention, Article 52(1)(a));\n\n(b) The Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (ICSID Convention, Article 52(1)(b);\n\n(c) There has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (ICSID Convention, Article 52(1)(d)); and\n\n(d) The award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based (\n\nICSID Convention, Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n4.\n\nThe Application for Annulment also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the ICSID Arbitration Rules), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment is decided.\n\n5.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on 30 January 2008, and on the same date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, transmitted a Notice of Registration to the Parties. The Parties were also notified that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 15 September 2008, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Parties were notified by the Centre that an *ad hoc* Committee (the Committee) had been constituted, composed of Mr. Christer Soderlund, a national of Sweden, Sir David A.O. Edward, QC, a national of the United Kingdom, and Ambassador Andreas J. Jacovides, a national of Cyprus. On the same date the Parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n7.\n\nOn 16 September 2008, Sempra filed a request to lift the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award (Sempra's Request).\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 10 October 2008, the Committee proposed to hold a first session by telephone conference on 21 October 2008. A provisional agenda for the session was attached to the letter. In the letter the Parties were further notified that the Committee had decided to continue the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award until 8 December 2008, the date fixed by the Committee to hear the Parties' oral pleadings on stay.\n\n9.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held, as proposed by the Committee and with the agreement of the Parties, on 21 October 2008, at 11:00 a.m. EST, by telephone conference. Before the session, the Secretariat distributed copies of the declarations, signed by each Member of the Committee, to the Parties pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2). During the first session several issues of procedure were agreed and decided.\n\n10.\n\nIn the course of the first session, it was decided by the Committee to continue the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award until a decision on this matter is taken by the Committee.\n\n11.\n\nCertain scheduling arrangements which could not be agreed during the course of the first session were resolved by the Parties shortly thereafter.\n\n12.\n\nIn conformity with the agreement of the Parties, notified to the Committee in Argentina's letter of October 27, 2008, Argentina filed its observations on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award on 7 November 2008 (Argentina's Observations). On the same basis, Sempra filed its observation on the stay issue on 21 November 2008 (Sempra's Observations).\n\n13.\n\nOn 8 December 2008, a hearing was held in Washington D.C. at which the Parties presented oral argument on the matter of the stay of enforcement (Hearing on Stay).\n\n14.\n\nSubsequent to the Hearing on Stay in a letter of 18 December 2008 Sempra, referring to the Vivendi *ad hoc* committee's request for a \"comfort letter\"1, and to Argentina's letter of 28 November 2008 to that committee, submitted that \"Argentina has again refused to change its interpretation of its obligations under Article 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention\".\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award rendered on 20 August 2007 (November 4, 2008) (hereinafter the *Vivendi Decision*).\n\n15.\n\nIn a letter of 29 December 2008 Argentina declared its readiness to provide comments on Sempra's submission while, at the same time, describing its letter to the Vivendi *ad hoc* committee as \"self-explanatory\".\n\n16.\n\nThe Committee did not consider that any further comments were called for.\n\n17.\n\nThe Members of the Committee have deliberated by telephone conference and exchange of emails and have taken into consideration the Parties' entire written and oral arguments and submissions on the matter of whether to terminate or continue the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n**B. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF IN RESPECT OF THE STAY**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Argentina's request for continuation of the stay of enforcement*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nArgentina has requested that the stay of enforcement of the Award be continued and that Argentina should not be required to post security for the amount of the Award as a condition for the continuation thereof.\n\n*Sempra's request for termination of the stay of enforcement*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nSempra has requested that the *ad hoc* Committee terminate the provisional stay of enforcement, or, if the stay is continued, that such stay be conditional on Argentina's posting adequate security or, in the alternative, that payment of the Award is made into an escrow account pending completion of these annulment proceedings.\n\n**Relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nFor purposes of the stay of enforcement, the following provisions of the ICSID Convention are of importance:\n\n21.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the ICSID Convention:\n\nThe Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\n\n22.\n\nRule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\n**Stay of Enforcement of the Award**\n\n(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays, shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\n\n**Circumstances that require a stay of enforcement**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Committee's authority to continue a stay is, according to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, dependent on whether \"the circumstances so require\". Nothing further is said on what circumstances the drafters of the ICSID Convention had in mind, or what the relative importance of various circumstances would be in the determination of this question. This is left to the discretion of the *ad hoc* committee.\n\n24.\n\nThere is now a relatively long line of decisions within the ICSID system on the matter of stay. Previous *ad hoc* committees have attached importance to the following circumstances:\n\n1. Prospects of compliance with the award\n\n2. Causation of economic hardship\n\n3. Prospects of recoupment\n\n4. A dilatory motive\n\n25.\n\nPrevious *ad hoc* committees have consistently rejected the proposition that a preliminary assessment of the prospects of the application for annulment should be a factor influencing the Committee's decision whether a stay should be granted or not.2\n\n*CDC Group plc v. Republic of Seychelles* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14), Decision on Whether or not to Continue Stay and Order of 14 July 2004 at para. 15; *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7), Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award of 30 November 2004 (hereinafter the *Mitchell Decision*) at para. 26; *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on the Respondent's Request for a Continued Stay of Execution of 1 June 2005 at para. 28; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award of 1 September 2006 (hereinafter the *CMS Decision*) at para. 37.\n\n26.\n\nIn addition to identifying the circumstances which require the granting of the stay, two *ad hoc* committees have \u2013 in more recent decisions3 \u2013 discussed whether it is for the party opposing continuation of the stay to show that \"circumstances\" militate against a stay or whether it is for the party seeking continuation of the stay to show that circumstances favour continuation of a stay.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award of 28 December 2007 (hereinafter the *Azurix Decision*) at para. 22, and *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award of 7 October 2008 (hereinafter the *Enron Decision*) at para 43.\n\n27.\n\nAgainst that background, the view of the present Committee as to the prerequisites for granting a stay can be summarized as follows. An ICSID award is immediately payable by the award debtor, irrespective of whether annulment is sought or not. A stay of enforcement should not in any event be automatic, and there should not even be a presumption in favour of granting a stay of enforcement. This follows, in the Committee's opinion, from the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, which authorizes the Committee to stay enforcement of the award pending its decision \"if it considers that the circumstances so require\". Although the ICSID Convention does not give any indication as to what circumstances would warrant a stay, it is nonetheless clear from this language that there must be *some* circumstances present that speak in favour of granting a stay. As a consequence, it cannot be assumed that there should be a presumption in favour of a stay or that the primary burden is placed on the award creditor to show that continuation of the stay should not be granted.\n\n28.\n\nRecent decisions have also discussed the question whether a decision to continue a stay may be made subject to conditions such as requiring the posting of a bank guarantee or what has, perhaps inappropriately, come to be referred to as a \"comfort letter\".4\n\n*E.g.* the *Azurix Decision* at para. 36.\n\n29.\n\nIn the present case, as in previous cases, the Parties' arguments have placed the prospect of compliance at the forefront of all the relevant circumstances, but they have also dwelt on other matters with a potential impact on a decision whether to terminate or continue the stay of enforcement.5\n\nArgentina has also expressed concern about enforcement of an award alleged by defects (Argentina's Observations, paras. 3, 30, 31 and 100). However, the Committee would not \u2013 consistent with established practice \u2013 allow such an assessment to influence its decision.\n\n**Prospects of compliance**\n---------------------------\n\n*Introduction*\n--------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Committee considers it essential to its decision whether to terminate or continue the stay that it should first assess the prospects of Argentina complying with the Award, should it not be annulled. Judging by the Parties' respective arguments on this subject, it is clear that they share this view. This also appears to be true of decisions of earlier *ad hoc* committees, where the matter of compliance has figured predominantly and even played a decisive role in the committee's conclusion.\n\n31.\n\nThe Parties are at issue as to the nature of Argentina's international obligations as to compliance with awards under the ICSID Convention. A decision on the nature of Argentina's obligation will therefore be of paramount importance to the Committee's assessment of the prospects of compliance. If the Committee finds, as Sempra submits, that Argentina's obligations are governed by Article 53 alone, then in view of the uncompromising position taken by Argentina that Sempra must first comply with Article 54, the Committee will be forced to conclude that there are no reasonable prospects that Argentina will, unconditionally and in good faith, \"abide by and comply with the terms of the award\" as required by Article 53 of the Convention.\n\n*Must the award creditor comply with Article 54 of the ICSID Convention?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nHaving regard to the Parties' positions on the matter of compliance, the Committee's first task will be to determine whether Article 53 of the ICSID Convention imposes an unconditional obligation upon an award debtor to comply voluntarily and in good faith with an ICSID award under that Article, or whether the award creditor must first apply to a local judicial or administrative agency of the State Party to seek enforcement in terms of Article 54 of the Convention.\n\n33.\n\nArgentina's position is that its obligation under international law under the ICSID Convention, as regards compliance with ICSID awards, is to satisfy the requirements of Article 53 *and* Article 54 of the ICSID Convention. For this reason, according to Argentina, the critical question is whether Argentina has put in place administrative arrangements and internal legislative procedures that provide an effective enforcement mechanism for ICSID awards, so as to ensure that an ICSID award will be enforced \"as far as the pecuniary obligations imposed by the award are concerned, as if it were a final judgment of an Argentine court\".6\n\nArgentina's Observations, para. 50.\n\n34.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the fact that Argentina has taken the appropriate steps to give effect to Article 54 will be of determinative importance to any conclusion as to whether Argentina will comply with an award or not. Argentina stresses, in particular, that \"[t]he supremacy of Argentina's international obligations \u2013 which include the awards issued by the ICSID tribunals \u2013 over the acts of Congress constitutes an adequate guarantee of compliance with the Award, in case the annulment requested by Argentina is not accepted\".7\n\nArgentina's Observations, para. 59.\n\n35.\n\nSempra, on the other hand, has emphasized that Argentina's obligation of compliance under international law in respect of ICSID awards follows from the language of Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, specifically as provided in Article 53(1), second sentence, to the effect that \"[e]ach party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention\". Hence, the ICSID Convention (and Article VII (6) of the 1991 US-Argentina Bilateral Investment Treaty (the US-Argentina BIT)8) \"create treaty obligations on the part of Argentina to voluntarily and without delay or conditions pay the Award\"9.\n\nTreaty between United States of America and The Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment; signed on 14 November 1991, in force since 20 October 1994.\n\nSempra's Observations, para. 4, first indentation.\n\n*Interpretation of Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nAccording to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), Article 31(1), \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\".\n\n*The terms of the Convention*\n-----------------------------\n\n37.\n\nArticle 53(1), second sentence, of the ICSID Convention imposes an unconditional obligation to comply, subject only to the *proviso* that a stay ordered in accordance with the provisions of the ICSID Convention will temporarily release a party from that obligation. The terms of this provision are clear and contain nothing to support the proposition that an award creditor must first seek enforcement pursuant to Article 54 in order to have the award complied with.\n\n38.\n\nIt is also clear that Article 53 is directed to the parties to a particular arbitration (\"the award shall be binding on the parties\"). Hence, the obligation to abide by and comply with the terms of the award is imposed on a *party to the arbitration* irrespective of whether that party is the foreign investor or the host State.\n\n39.\n\nIn contrast, Article 54 imposes an obligation, not on the parties to a particular arbitration, but on \"[e]ach Contracting State\" - *i.e.* on *all the parties to the ICSID Convention*, to \"recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State\". It is true that one of the parties referred to in Article 53 will necessarily also be one of the \"Contracting States\" referred to in Article 54. However, the fact that Argentina as a Contracting State comes under an obligation to comply with Article 54 does not deprive Article 53 of its effect in imposing an unconditional obligation on Argentina in its capacity as a party to the arbitration \"to abide by and comply with the terms of the award\".\n\n*The object and purpose of Article 54 of the Convention*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nIt is fair to ask whether any rational purpose would be served by a requirement that enforcement be sought by the award creditor in the debtor State under Article 54 of the ICSID Convention in order to obtain satisfaction of the award. It must be observed that there is a fundamental difference between enforcement of awards under the New York Convention and the ICSID Convention, in that Article 5 of the New York Convention envisages certain grounds on which the award may be subject to judicial review at a national level and which may entitle a State to refuse enforcement.\n\n41.\n\nThe ICSID Convention, on the other hand, does *not* offer any scope for review on the national plane. An award given under the ICSID Convention shall (as far as it concerns pecuniary obligations) be enforced \"as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State\".\n\n42.\n\nFor this reason, there would simply be no *rationale* for a requirement that an award creditor seeking payment should first subject itself to any form of local enforcement procedure. It is certainly true that a State party, when complying with an ICSID award, has to make the necessary budget allocations to procure the requisite funding, but that is an entirely different matter from requiring the award creditor to subject itself to an enforcement procedure before the national courts.\n\n*The context of Articles 53 and 54 of the Convention*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nAccording to the VCLT, Article 31(1), a treaty shall also be interpreted, *inter aliat* by considering its terms \"in their context\". In this regard, it is appropriate to review Articles 53 and 54 together with Article 27(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides as follows:\n\nNo Contracting State shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its nationals and another Contracting State shall have consented to submit or shall have submitted to arbitration under this Convention, unless such other Contracting State shall have failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in such dispute.\n\n44.\n\nThis provision mirrors the undertaking expressed in Article 53 that parties to the arbitration are to abide by and comply with an ICSID award. This is also quite logical. It cannot possibly be correct that a State's failure to comply with its international obligation \u2013 constituted under Article 53 \u2013 must be submitted to a national court for ultimate resolution. The option of coercive enforcement is not available on the international plane, and an award creditor in the ICSID regime will therefore have no other choice than to seek diplomatic protection or to bring \"an international claim\".\n\n45.\n\nIt should further be noted that the enforcement mechanism, which a contracting party to the ICSID Convention undertakes to provide, concerns only the enforcement of \"pecuniary obligations imposed by that award\". This restriction is necessary because an ICSID award may well be of a declaratory character or impose obligations on a party to do or refrain from doing certain acts, something which would not lend itself to enforcement, in particular in a third State jurisdiction.\n\n46.\n\nFurther, in the negotiating history of the ICSID Convention, it was generally believed that States would voluntarily comply with awards rendered by ICSID tribunals rendering any question of enforcement moot. The enforcement option provided for in Article 54 rather sought to allay any concern of a State party that recourse could not be had against investor parties.10 One may even question whether there was any expectation that enforcement against a State debtor would have to be undertaken within that State's own (or any other Contracting State's) enforcement apparatus.\n\nHistory of the ICSID Convention, Vol. II-1 at 379.\n\n47.\n\nIn general, the Committee adopts the reasoning of the Enron *ad hoc* committee and considers that it has quite succinctly identified the error in the position advocated by Argentina in the following words:11\n\nThe ICSID dispute settlement mechanism was intended to be an international method of settlement, and it would run counter to this intention for compliance with a final award to be subject, ultimately, to the provisions and mechanisms of national law.\n\nThe *Enron Decision*, at para. 68 (Argentina expresses its disagreement with this statement in its Observations, para. 130).\n\n48.\n\nThe Committee accepts that, as Argentina points out, the procedure applied in the *MTD v. Chile* case presupposed recourse to the enforcement procedure envisaged in Article 54 of the ICSID Convention (although the distinction between the role of Chile as an enforcement agent and as the payer under the award is not made clear).12\n\nExecution of judgment, R-28\n\n49.\n\nBe that as it may, the particular way in which compliance with an ICSID award may have been carried out in any specific instance does not in any way affect interpretation of the text of the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*The US-Argentina BIT*\n----------------------\n\n50.\n\nIt should also be noted that the US-Argentina BIT contains language which is equivalent to the relevant part of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\nVII (6) Any arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Article shall be final and be binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement.\n\n51.\n\nThe provision brings home the final and binding character of any award as regards the obligation of \"the parties to the dispute \u2026 to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement\". Use of the word \"and\" makes it clear that the contracting States have undertaken two obligations \u2013 to carry out the award *and* to ensure facilities for the enforcement of awards. Taking into account that the US-Argentina BIT offers alternative dispute resolution routes \u2013 ICSID arbitration, *ad hoc* arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and any other agreed method \u2013 it is logical that the reference to \"enforcement\" in the BIT is not more specific as dispute resolution methods other than ICSID arbitration would be subject to the recognition and enforcement requirements of the New York Convention. The fact that the formulation of the provision does not distinguish between the roles of the State party as a party to the dispute and as a party to the BIT, does not cast doubt on this interpretation.\n\n*The Committee's conclusion*\n----------------------------\n\n52.\n\nOn the basis of the considerations discussed above, the Committee concludes that a State Party against which an award has been made must (like a foreign investor party) abide by and comply with an ICSID award without the award creditor having to submit to any agency of the State Party to enforce the award as envisaged by Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n53.\n\nThe very fact that the Committee has found that Argentina is under a duty, unconditionally and in good faith, to \"abide by and comply with\" the Award according to Article 53, together with Argentina's repeated and uncompromising affirmation that it has no such obligation in the absence of the award creditor submitting the award to a procedure within the State party's domestic judicial system under Article 54, must necessarily lead to the conclusion that Argentina is not willing to comply with its obligations under Article 53 unless Sempra first seeks enforcement under Article 54. This is an important consideration to be weighed when determining the future of the present stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n54.\n\nNotwithstanding this conclusion, the Committee will also examine the other circumstances which, in the opinion of Argentina, show that Argentina will comply with the Award, should annulment be denied.\n\n*The third party \"guarantee\" of payment*\n----------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nIt would appear that two gas distribution companies, Camuzzi Gas del Sur S.A. and Camuzzi Gas Pampeana S.A (the Gas Companies) have been allowed an increase in tariffs by the State agency UNIREN13, against an undertaking to indemnify Argentina against any adverse economic effects following from, *inter alia*, the present ICSID case.14\n\nUnidad de Renegotiation y Analisis de Contratos de Servicios P\u00fbblicos.\n\nParas 18.3.1 and 18.3.2 of a Deed of Agreement on the Equalization of a License Contract for Distribution of Natural Gas, R-29.\n\n56.\n\nThe Committee is not in a position \u2013 and has no need \u2013 to form an opinion as to whether the advantage to the Gas Companies created by the increased tariffs is worth more or less than the potential cost to the companies of indemnifying Argentina in respect of any payment on an ICSID award. Nor does the Committee need to opine on the questions whether the Gas Companies are or will be solvent to make good such an undertaking or whether the cost of complying with this undertaking will be passed on to the Argentine gas consumers or the ultimate shareholders of the Gas Companies (or both).\n\n57.\n\nSuffice it to note that the fact that the Gas Companies may indemnify Argentina in no way constitutes a *guarantee* that compliance *vis-\u00e0-vis* Sempra will follow. Nor, in view of a number of unknowns \u2013 the solvency of the Gas Companies and the allegation of illegality in conjunction with statements from Sempra that it will seek to invalidate the contracts \u2013 is there any basis to conclude that the \u2013 possible \u2013 existence of undertakings to indemnify Argentina will in any way increase the likelihood of Argentina's compliance.\n\n*Is the constitutional framework and the legal system of Argentina to be considered when deciding whether to terminate or continue?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nArgentina dedicates a significant part of its Observations to discussing the supremacy of Argentina's international obligations within its constitutional framework and the hierarchy of laws established thereby, emphasizing its importance in view of the fact that \"the effective enforcement of an award depends on the treatment of international obligations by Argentine law\".15\n\nArgentina's Observations, para. 51.\n\n59.\n\nThis discussion would have a certain relevance if it were correct that an award against Argentina rendered pursuant to the ICSID Convention must be enforced as a final judgment of an Argentine court under Article 54. However, as the Committee has held, this is an untenable proposition. It would clearly be inconsistent with fundamental principles of international law if the obligation of a State under an international treaty would have to be submitted to that State's national courts (or any other agency on a national level) for verification and implementation. In view of the fact that Argentina has a duty to \"abide by and comply with\" the Award pursuant to Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, its constitutional setup and legislative system are irrelevant as a \"circumstance\" requiring the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n60.\n\nIt is certainly true, as Argentina has pointed out, that the CMS *ad hoc* committee discussed Argentina's duty to comply in terms of enforcement of an award under Article 54, opining that \"an ICSID award is to be given the same effect as a final judgment of the courts of the respondent state\" and that such awards \"under the ICSID Convention are directly enforceable\".16\n\n*CMS Decision* at para. 41.\n\n61.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that it is for this reason that the CMS *ad hoc* committee embarked on a discussion concerning the internal mechanics of Argentinean domestic law, concluding that \"in the opinion of the Committee it has not been shown that Argentina needed to take any further step to give effect to the Convention and in particular to its Article 54\".17\n\nId. at para 45.\n\n62.\n\nAn *ad hoc* committee would not normally have to engage in an examination of a State Party's constitutional framework or the organization of its legislative setup or the organisational coordination of its executive, legislature and judiciary.\n\n63.\n\nThe reason why these considerations have been presented by Argentina for the Committee's appraisal in the present case is that they purportedly give constitutional guarantees for Argentina's compliance with Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, which does engage national law and therefore \u2013 if relevant \u2013 would impact on the Committee's assessment of prospects of compliance. The Committee accepts the logic of this approach, given that Argentina attaches decisive weight to the requirements of Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n64.\n\nHowever, the matters relied on by Argentina only allow the conclusion that the inner workings of Argentina's legal system do not make voluntary compliance impossible. They do not impact \u2013 in view of Argentina's position on Articles 53 and 54 \u2013 on the assessment of the likelihood of Argentina's compliance with Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Prior history of compliance with international awards*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nArgentina has invoked the fact that it has complied with a line of international awards in the past18 and that it must be assumed, on that basis, that compliance will follow also in respect of the Award.\n\nArgentina has dealt with these awards in its Observations, paras. 60-68.\n\n66.\n\nThe Committee considers that Sempra has correctly emphasized that the instances referred to by Argentina relate to border disputes and human rights issues, and that they have very limited relevance as an indication that Argentina will honour an ICSID award.\n\n*The CMS case*\n--------------\n\n67.\n\nSpecifically, Sempra has invoked what it terms Argentina's previous history of noncompliance in respect of the *CMS award*19.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of 12 May 2005 (hereinafter the *CMS Award*).\n\n68.\n\nDuring the CMS annulment proceedings, the question was raised whether Argentina could be expected to comply with the award, should the application for annulment be rejected. This question was triggered by the fact that the CMS *ad hoc* committee had observed that former Ministers of Justice and Finance of Argentina as well as the agent of Argentina in the CMS case had made a variety of statements, indicating the possibility of submitting the validity of ICSID awards to the International Court of Justice.20 The CMS *ad hoc* committee therefore took the unusual step of inviting Argentina to submit a statement on its intention to comply with the ICSID Convention. Responding to this request, Argentina provided \"an undertaking to [CMS] that, in accordance with its obligations under the ICSID Convention, it will recognize the award rendered by the arbitral tribunal as binding and will enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories, in the event that annulment is not granted\".21 On the strength of this commitment, the CMS *ad hoc* committee decided to continue the stay for the duration of the annulment proceedings.\n\n*CMS Decision* at para. 18.\n\nOne may note that the formulation of this undertaking \u2013 by echoing the language of Article 54 of the ICSID Convention \u2013 is inept as Argentina's obligation to enforce ICSID awards as a Contracting Party is not at issue in the present context.\n\n69.\n\nIn its decision on Argentina's application for annulment, dispatched to the parties on 25 September 2007, the CMS *ad hoc* committee annulled a part of the *CMS Award* dealing with the so-called \"umbrella clause\" of the relevant BIT. This did not, however, entail any consequence for the amount of damages that Argentina was ordered to pay in terms of the award.\n\n70.\n\nSempra notes that\u2013 despite the fact that the CMS Decision on Annulment was rendered more than 14 months ago and despite the fact that the stay ordered by the CMS *ad hoc* committee was automatically lifted as from the date of its decision pursuant to Rule 54(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules \u2013 the *CMS Award* has not been complied with by Argentina as of the date of the Hearing on Stay.\n\n71.\n\nArgentina has responded that it has not failed to comply with the *CMS Award*. Specifically, in the view of Argentina, CMS has refused to follow the procedure provided for in Argentina for compliance with final judgments enunciated in Article 54 of the ICSID Convention. Additionally, CMS has \u2013 improperly \u2013 transferred its rights to the award, which requires prior analysis of the legality under international law.\n\n72.\n\nIn view of its conclusion as to the nature of Argentina's obligation under Article 53, this Committee is unable to accept that either of these circumstances justifies Argentina's failure to abide by and comply with the *CMS Award*. While it is true that the letter of assurance required by the CMS committee speaks about the duty to \"enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award\", this cannot be interpreted as instituting requirements for complying with the *CMS Award* that would be different from what applies generally to ICSID awards.\n\n*The Enron case*\n----------------\n\n73.\n\nAs noted above, the Enron *ad hoc* committee examined in detail the interplay between Articles 53 and 54 and the applicability of Article 53 to the obligation imposed on the parties to the ICSID arbitral proceedings (whether they be a foreign investor or a State party). Looking at this question, the Enron *ad hoc* committee found \"Argentina's stated position as to its obligations to pay on a final award to be incorrect\".22 However, accepting that Argentina had acted in good faith, the Enron *ad hoc* committee decided to extend the stay of enforcement for a period of a minimum of 60 days, after which date the claimants would be able to apply for a modification or termination of the stay. The 60 days allowed by the Enron *ad hoc* committee was considered as \"sufficient time for Argentina to reconsider its position\", failing which the *ad hoc* committee upon application of the claimants would \"be prepared to reconsider the issue of continuance of the stay and the issue of security by reference to the circumstances then existing.\"23\n\nThe *Enron Decision*, at para. 102.\n\nId., at para. 103.\n\n74.\n\nAccording to Sempra's affirmation,24 uncontested by Argentina, Argentina has not notified the Enron *ad hoc* committee of any reconsideration of its position.\n\nSempra's letter of 18 December 2008 to the Committee, para 14 *supra*.\n\n*The Vivendi case*\n------------------\n\n75.\n\nFurther, in the *Vivendi Decision*, dispatched to the parties on 4 November 2008, the Vivendi *ad hoc* committee offered Argentina the opportunity \"to provide the Committee with a more elaborate official letter to be issued by Dr. Guglielmino in his capacity as the *Procurador del Tesoro de la Nacion Argentina* and as Agent of Argentina in the present annulment proceeding\" within a time period of 30 days from notification of the decision. Such letter had not been provided to the Vivendi *ad hoc* committee at the time of the Hearing on Stay, according to Sempra's affirmation, uncontested by Argentina, and no assurance was made that such letter would be forthcoming.25\n\nAccording to Sempra's letter of 18 December 2008 to the Committee, attaching a letter of 28 November 2008 by Argentina, \"Argentina has again refused to change its interpretation of its obligations under article 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention\".\n\n76.\n\nBased on the above, the Committee understands that, up to the date of the Hearing on Stay, Argentina has not heeded the Enron *ad hoc* committee's invitation to reconsider its position on Argentina's obligation under Article 53 or given any indication that it will issue a satisfactory assurance as directed by the Vivendi *ad hoc* committee.\n\n**Causation of economic hardship**\n----------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nArgentina has referred to the severe economic crisis it has recently suffered, calling for a declaration of a state of emergency. The emergency law is, according to Sempra, still in force (December 2008). Argentina considers that being required to procure a bank guarantee or to place funds in escrow would cause economic hardship and explains that\n\n[i]n the face of the current international financial uncertainty, a requirement to freeze such amount of money would be particularly detrimental to any State and, especially, to an emerging country such as Argentina. Under the present circumstances of the international economy, liquidity is one of the main concerns to all the agents of international economy. Taking a measure affecting liquidity \u2013 already severely limited \u2013 would have serious consequences for Argentina.26\n\nArgentina's Observations, para. 99.\n\n78.\n\nIn the opinion of Sempra, Argentina certainly found itself in quite dire financial straights in 2001 and 2002, but Sempra notes that the economy has made a remarkable recovery in recent years and that \"its economy is much healthier today than it was before the economic problems of 2001-2002\".27 For this reason, in Sempra's view, there is no sufficient reason that would prevent the Committee from conditioning the continuation of a stay with a duty to post a bank guarantee or to place funds in escrow.\n\nSempra's Observations, para. 114.\n\n79.\n\nThe Committee is not satisfied, on the basis of the information placed before it, that the circumstances invoked by Argentina amount to economic hardship of such a nature or degree as to constitute, in themselves, a reason for not lifting the stay or continuing the stay without requiring a bank guarantee or the placing of funds in escrow.\n\n**Prospects of recoupment**\n---------------------------\n\n80.\n\nArgentina has invoked the fact that *ad hoc* committees have on more than one occasion referred to the eventuality that it may not be possible to recoup payments made to an award creditor where the award is subsequently annulled.28 In order to allay Argentina's apprehensions in this regard, Sempra has offered to have such funds as Argentina pays out to meet its indebtedness according to the Award placed in an escrow account, pending outcome of the present annulment proceedings.29\n\nReferences have been made to the *Mitchell Decision*, at para. 33 and to the *CMS Decision*, at para. 38.\n\nSempra's Observations, para. 9.\n\n81.\n\nOn the occasion of the Hearing on Stay, Sempra has additionally confirmed that, should the stay be lifted, it undertakes also to place such funds as it would recover by enforcement proceedings in other jurisdictions in such an account.30\n\nTranscript (English), page 258, line 13\n\n82.\n\nOn this basis, Sempra considers that there is no risk of non-recoupment, if Argentina prevails in its application for annulment.\n\n83.\n\nThe Committee is confident that a risk of possible non-recoupment of funds paid out under the Award in the event that the Award is partially or wholly annulled may be effectively eliminated by instituting an appropriate escrow arrangement.\n\n**Other circumstances**\n-----------------------\n\n*Absence of post-award interest*\n--------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nSempra has argued that under the terms of the Award it is not entitled to post-award interest. Consequently, should the stay be continued and should the application for annulment be denied, the passage of time up till the point in time when payment may be effected will erode the value of the Award. This circumstance, in the opinion of Sempra, militates in favour of terminating the stay.\n\n85.\n\nThe Committee does not consider that the application of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention can be affected by the question of whether the award creditor was awarded post-award interest or not.31\n\nThis position is consistent with the *Enron Decision*, at para. 96.\n\n*Enforcement proceedings against Argentina initiated by Sempra*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nArgentina has noted that upon receipt of the Award, \"Sempra rushed to different jurisdictions\" to enforce the Award while still open to the annulment procedure provided for in Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and even after the stay was provisionally granted on 30 January 2008. This course of action, according to Argentina, attests to Sempra's bad faith and is a circumstance which, in Argentina's view, militates in favour of continuation of the stay.\n\n87.\n\nSempra has responded that all these enforcement actions were initiated prior to the date on which the provisional stay was granted, *i.e.* 30 January 2008 and that two instances of requests for conservatory measures (in Paris and Boulogne-sur-Mer, respectively) concern measures which do not qualify as \"enforcement\". On the occasion of the Hearing on Stay, Sempra has recognized its obligation not to enforce the Award as long as the stay remains in place.32\n\nTranscript (English), page 225, line 22.\n\n*May an annulment committee make its decision on stay subject to conditions?*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nArgentina has emphasized that in all annulment proceedings which have taken place since the very beginning of the history of the ICSID Convention and from the first application for annulment in the *Kl\u00f4ckner* case, no single *ad hoc* committee has failed to grant a stay of enforcement of the award during the pendency of the annulment proceedings, albeit, in a number of cases, conditions have been imposed. There is, for this reason, a consistent and solidly established case law which is \"unanimous in accepting the need for a continued stay of enforcement of the award pending annulment proceedings\".33\n\nArgentina's Observations, para. 15.\n\n89.\n\nArgentina further contends that the ICSID Convention does not empower an *ad hoc* committee to make the continuation of a stay subject to the posting of a financial guarantee or the imposition of any other condition. The *ad hoc* committee's powers are limited to continuing or terminating the stay of enforcement of the award.\n\n90.\n\nArgentina relies on the following circumstances:\n\no The ICSID Convention does not include any express authority for the *ad hoc* Committee to impose conditions.\n\no The negotiating history of the ICSID Convention shows that an original proposal to allow the possibility of imposing interim measures \u2013 of which the posting of a guarantee is one \u2013 was subsequently abandoned.\n\no The New York Convention, which in its Article VI envisages the possibility of ordering a stay of enforcement of an award, contains an express power of the \"competent authority\" to order the other party to give suitable security. As the ICSID Convention does not include similar language, the conclusion must be drawn that no such power is given to the *ad hoc* committee.\n\no Imposing a requirement to post a guarantee limits access to the protection of which any award debtor should be ensured, pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\no A guarantee places the award creditor in a more favourable situation than the one available under the ICSID Convention system in contradiction to the general spirit of the Convention, including Article 55 which preserves the immunity of Contracting States against enforcement.\n\n91.\n\nIn Sempra's view, Argentina's position on the absence of any power of the *ad hoc* committee to order the posting of security is unsupported by the ICSID Convention's history and ICSID practice.\n\n92.\n\nAdditionally, Sempra argues, the provision of security represents a suitable counterbalance to the risk of non-compliance, should the application for annulment be rejected. Security, therefore, does not constitute a penalty for seeking annulment. The posting of security does not put the award creditor in a \"better\" position, as it should not be compared to any enforcement risk in the absence of security under Article 54.\n\n93.\n\nCertain of these arguments can be dealt with quite briefly.\n\n94.\n\nAs regards Argentina's contention that this Committee must continue the stay of enforcement because of previous case law, the Committee recognizes that previous decisions are persuasive precedents. But the Committee does not consider them to be binding precedents, not least because each decision is taken on the facts of the case to which it relates.\n\n95.\n\nAs to whether provision of a guarantee would, as Argentina contends, place the award creditor in \"a better situation\", the Committee considers that the appropriate comparison is not with a scenario where the award debtor would not comply with its obligation under Article 53 (where a guarantee would obviously be \"better\"), but with one where the debtor would comply. In such case the guarantee would not place the award creditor in a better situation. Although not relevant for the comparison, if there is a risk that the award debtor \u2013 whether a State party or a foreign investor \u2013 would not comply with its obligation under Article 53, the safeguard inherent in provision of a guarantee would be fully warranted.\n\n96.\n\nNeither does the Committee agree that \"[t]he provision of a guarantee would penalise the party that applies for annulment\". The appropriate comparison is the scenario where annulment is not sought; in that case the award debtor would be obliged to comply with the award immediately upon its rendering, *i.e*. to make the payment that the bank guarantee is intended to ensure.\n\n97.\n\nAs regards Sempra's argument that posting a security is a \"counterbalance\" to the negative effect of a stay of enforcement and should therefore be required, the Committee notes that the right to seek annulment of an ICSID award is a right under the Convention, so there is no requirement that there should be any \"counterbalance\" to the \"negative effect\" of a continued stay of enforcement, whether in the form of security or otherwise.\n\n98.\n\nTurning therefore to the general question whether an *ad hoc* committee is empowered to require the provision of security as a condition for continuation of a stay, the Committee notes that this has not, as such, been the subject of argument to any noticeable extent in previous cases; it would seem that this power was simply assumed to exist. Not until in the *Enron Decision* was a more thorough analysis of this question undertaken. The Enron *ad hoc* committee noted that a stay had been ordered in all of the eleven cases34 known to the committee and that on five of those occasions, the continuation of the stay was made conditional upon the provision of security.\n\nThose eleven cases are identified in footnote 10 of para. 27 of the *Enron Decision*.\n\n99.\n\nThe Committee further notes that the Enron *ad hoc* committee considered a modification of Argentina's position on this score \u2013 or simply a statement concerning its obligation to make payment of the award if not annulled35 \u2013 \"as sufficing to dispel doubts that Argentina will comply with its obligations under Article 53 in the future\", and that this would make it unnecessary to require the posting of security.\n\nThe *Enron Decision*, at para. 102.\n\n100.\n\nSimilarly, in the *Vivendi Decision*, Argentina was offered the possibility to reconsider its position on Article 53 and Article 54 and to submit an appropriately worded \"letter of assurance\".\n\n101.\n\nThe Committee has reached the view, fortified by these precedents, that an *ad hoc* committee is empowered by the Convention to require the posting of security or another appropriate assurance of compliance as a condition of granting a stay of enforcement. The question is therefore whether this should be required in the present case.\n\n102.\n\nThe information available to the Committee is to the following effect:\n\no the *CMS Award* has not been complied with although annulment proceedings were already concluded in September 2007;\n\no the opportunity extended to Argentina by the Enron *ad hoc* committee to reconsider its position on Article 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention has gone unheeded;\n\no the Vivendi *ad hoc* committee's exhortation for Argentina to issue a letter of assurance has not been satisfactorily responded to.\n\n103.\n\nFurther, despite the clear conclusions of previous *ad hoc* committees, Argentina's position on Article 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention in the present case remains unaltered from its previous stance. Argentina still maintains before this Committee that its obligation to abide by and comply with an award under Article 53 is conditional upon recourse by the award creditor to a domestic enforcement procedure under Article 54.\n\n*The Committee's conclusion*\n----------------------------\n\n104.\n\nIn the circumstances discussed above, this Committee cannot regard Argentina's compliance with its obligations under Article 53 as being simply a matter of \"doubt\". On the contrary, Argentina's posture makes it clear that it will in fact *not* comply with its obligation \"to abide by and comply with\" an award in Sempra's favour unless and until Sempra seeks recognition and enforcement of the Award before an Argentine judicial tribunal in the manner prescribed by the national law of Argentina. At the Hearing on Stay, the representatives of Argentina were unable to assure the Committee that recognition and enforcement would automatically be granted by that tribunal.\n\n105.\n\nThe Committee therefore considers it essential that, if the stay of enforcement is to be continued in force until the Committee has decided whether the Award (or any part of it) should be annulled, Argentina must be required to give some tangible demonstration of its preparedness to comply, unconditionally and in good faith, with its obligations under Article 53 of the Convention.\n\n106.\n\nSempra proposes that Argentina should be required to deposit the amount of the Award, or an appropriate proportion thereof, into an escrow account, and that an appropriate arrangement should be put in place for this purpose. Sempra concedes that an appropriate period \u2013 perhaps 120 days \u2013 should be allowed for this purpose, during which the stay of enforcement would remain in force. If Argentina failed to deposit the required amount, the stay of enforcement should be terminated.\n\n107.\n\nArgentina maintains that payment of the amount awarded would cause significant hardship to the country, having regard to its effect on liquidity not only as a consequence of freezing funds payable under the Sempra Award \"but also the prospective cumulative effect of freezing the funds payable under the Awards, the annulment of which was sought by the Argentine Republic\".36\n\nArgentina's Observations, para. 101.\n\n108.\n\nHowever, in the view of the Committee, the adverse effect on liquidity of an arrangement for payment into an escrow account would be no different from that which would flow directly from the requirement to pay the Award itself, which would be the outcome, should the stay be terminated.\n\n109.\n\nIn reaching its decision, the Committee does not consider that a \"comfort letter\" along the lines stipulated in the *CMS* or *Vivendi* decisions would provide appropriate assurances already for two reasons. First, it appears from the record before this Committee that Argentina is not prepared to grant such a letter. Second, such a letter, if granted, would only confirm and restate Argentina's obligations under the ICSID Convention.37\n\nAs noted in the *Enron Decision,* para. 36\n\n110.\n\nOn the other hand, the Committee does not believe that it will be necessary to require Argentina to provide Sempra with security for the entire amount of the Award. The primary purpose of this measure is not to guarantee payment but to provide appropriate assurances that compliance will take place in the future if, and to the extent that, Argentina's application for annulment is denied.\n\n111.\n\nThe Committee must also consider whether Argentina should be required to provide a bank guarantee or, as accepted by Sempra, to arrange for payment into escrow \"for a portion of the award\"38.\n\nSempra's Observations, para 9.\n\n112.\n\nThe Committee considers that the most rational approach to this matter is that, as a tangible demonstration of good faith, Argentina should be required \u2013 as a condition of the stay being continued \u2013 to place USD 75 million in escrow, pending the Committee's decision on Argentina's application for annulment of the Award.\n\n113.\n\nThe Committee considers that 120 days39 should be allowed from the date of issuance of this decision to enable the Parties to agree on an appropriate escrow arrangement and to arrange for the funds to be paid into such escrow. In the meanwhile, the stay of enforcement will remain in place.\n\nThis estimate was also made by Sempra on the Hearing on Stay (transcript (English version), page 233, line 17.\n\n114.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Committee wishes to clarify that its decision to require the payment of that sum into escrow is based on its assessment of what is required to constitute an appropriate assurance that Argentina will abide by and comply with the Award to the extent that it is not annulled. It is not based on any provisional assessment of the prospects of annulment, nor is it calculated as a specific proportion of the Award.\n\n115.\n\nThe Committee must further emphasize that Argentina's payment into escrow is not conditional upon any requirement that Sempra resort to any national procedure under Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n116.\n\nOnce the escrow arrangement is established, the Committee requires that whatever enforcement, attachment or conservatory measures Sempra has so far initiated, should not be pursued.\n\nC. THE DECISION\n---------------\n\n117.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the stay of enforcement of the Award will continue in effect for the duration of these annulment proceedings, on condition that Argentina places in escrow an amount of USD 75,000,000 (seventy-five million United States dollars) which amount, including accrued interest, will be collectible in its entirety by Sempra in partial discharge of Argentina\u2019s payment obligation under the Award, in the event that Argentina\u2019s application for annulment of the Award is completely rejected. If the application is partially accepted by the Committee, Sempra may collect the funds in escrow for that portion of the Award which is not annulled, without prejudice to the possible continuation of the stay allowed by Rule 54(3) and Rule 55(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules\n\n118.\n\nIf Argentina fails to place in escrow the sum required by the preceding paragraph within 120 days from the date of the issuance of this decision, the Committee may - at the request of Sempra - order the termination of the stay of enforcement with or without providing any opportunity for Argentina to make up for any delinquent payment.\n\n119.\n\nIn the event where Sempra considers the escrow arrangement offered by Argentina as unsatisfactory, Sempra may bring this matter to the Committee\u2019s attention by submitting a notice at the relevant time, but no later than 30 (thirty) days before expiry of the time limit set forth above. Argentina shall be entitled to submit comments and take corrective action by reason of such notice. If the Committee considers that the escrow arrangement is unsatisfactory - despite corrective action, if any - the Committee may terminate the stay pursuant to Rule 54(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n120.\n\nAny third-party cost for the establishment and maintenance of the escrow arrangement shall be for the account of Argentina."}, {"Title": "Decision on Sempra Energy International\u2019s Request for the Termination of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award (Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules)", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2009-08-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Sempra Energy International\u2019s Request for the Termination of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award (Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 25 January 2008, the Argentine Republic filed an annulment application with the Secretary-General of ICSID. The application included a request under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention for a stay of enforcement of the Award, pending a decision by the Committee to be constituted on the application for annulment.\n\n2.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the application on 30 January 2008, at the same time notifying the Parties pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules that enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n3.\n\nOn 16 September 2008, Sempra filed a request that the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award be lifted. As agreed by the Parties, Argentina filed observations on the continuation of the stay of enforcement on 7 November 2008, while Sempra filed its observations on 21 November 2008.\n\n4.\n\nOn 8 December 2008, a hearing was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington DC, at which the Parties presented oral arguments to the Committee on the matter of the stay of enforcement. The Committee issued its decision on stay on 5 March 2009.\n\n5.\n\nIn its decision on stay on 5 March 2009, the Committee granted a continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award subject to the condition that Argentina place in escrow an amount of USD 75 million. The Committee's decision further provided that if Argentina failed to place in escrow the sum required within 120 days from the date of the issuance of the decision, the Committee might - at the request of Sempra - order termination of the stay of enforcement with or without providing any opportunity for Argentina to make up for any failure in payment.\n\n6.\n\nIn a letter of 13 May 2009 to the Committee, Sempra requested that the stay of enforcement be lifted. The reason for the request was that Argentina had not agreed to, let alone offered, any escrow agreement, as provided by the Committee's decision.\n\n7.\n\nIn particular, Sempra referred to paragraph 119 of the Committee's decision, which provides:\n\nIn the event where Sempra considers the escrow arrangement offered by Argentina as unsatisfactory, Sempra may bring this matter to the Committee's attention by submitting a notice at the relevant time, but no later than 30 (thirty) days before expiry of the time limit set forth above. Argentina shall be entitled to submit comments and take corrective action by reason of such notice. If the Committee considers that the escrow arrangement is unsatisfactory - despite corrective action, if any -the Committee may terminate the stay pursuant to Rule 54(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n8.\n\nIn a letter of 22 May 2009, the Committee invited Argentina to offer comments on Sempra's letter of 13 May 2009. In this respect the Committee referred to that part of its decision, quoted above, which entitles Argentina to \"submit comments and take corrective action\" in the event where Sempra considers any escrow arrangement offered by Argentina as unsatisfactory.\n\n9.\n\nIn a communication of 1 June 2009, Argentina made reference to certain discussions said to have taken place between Argentina and \"counsel for Sempra\" in the *Enron* case1, *inter alia*, concerning a proposal to put an escrow agreement in place as a condition for continuing the stay in those annulment proceedings. Argentina had explained that such an arrangement as proposed would create \"unacceptable risks of attachment\" to Argentina, pointing to the contingency of other creditors attaching Argentina's entitlement to lift the amount in escrow, should its application for annulment be granted. In that event, it could not be guaranteed that the funds would be repatriated to Argentina, since they might be taken to satisfy third party creditors of Argentina who had attached Argentina's interest in the escrowed funds. Argentina noted, in particular, that the *ad hoc* committee in the *Enron* annulment proceedings had, for reasons given in paragraph 42 of that committee's decision of 20 May 2009, granted a continuation of the stay without conditions.\n\nArgentina has requested that this Committee do likewise.\n\nEnron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3) - Annulment Proceeding.\n\n10.\n\nIn a letter of 10 June 2009, Sempra expressed its disagreement with the *Enron* committee's reasoning on the point of third-party attachment risk, emphasizing that, taking such a risk into account \"encourages recalcitrant debtors [---] to continue repudiating their international monetary obligations\", and questioning why Sempra should suffer the consequences of \"Argentina's unilateral decision to renege on its prior international monetary obligations\".\n\n11.\n\nIn the same letter, Sempra reiterated its request that the Committee lift the stay of enforcement, noting that Argentina had not only failed to \"offer\" an escrow arrangement but had not even responded to a draft escrow agreement proposed by Sempra, let alone committed any funds into such escrow.\n\n12.\n\nThe Parties have volunteered additional submissions on this matter, Sempra on 16 July and Argentina on 17 July 2009.\n\n*The Committee's assessment*\n----------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Committee's decision to grant a continuation of the stay of enforcement subject to conditions was made in its decision of 5 March 2009. Considering the 120 days allowed to the Parties to finalize an escrow arrangement, the Committee notes that this time limit expired as at 3 July 2009. Sempra brought the matter of Argentina's failure to offer any escrow arrangement - let alone a satisfactory one - to the Committee's attention on 13 May 2009, i.e. before the time limit of 30 days set out in paragraph 119 of the decision had expired.\n\n14.\n\nIn its letter of 17 June 2009 to the Parties, the Committee stated that it would consider the Parties' arguments on the matter of the currently ongoing stay and issue a decision in respect of the Sempra's request that the stay now be lifted. Further, the Committee invited the Parties to communicate \"any new development or other circumstances, which may be relevant for the matters presently pending\". No such further information has been communicated to the Committee.\n\n15.\n\nIn essence, Argentina's defence is based on the following: the placing of funds in escrow (or issuing a letter of credit) would cause prohibitive cost to Argentina, *inter alia*, because procurement of a bank guarantee or letter of credit would incur prohibitive cost and the cost \"for Argentina of setting up an escrow account would be equal to the cost of obtaining a letter of credit\".\n\n16.\n\nThe Committee notes that the evidence relied on by Argentina in this respect rests on the assumption that the amount to be placed in escrow is to be borrowed in the international financial markets and that such borrowing has to be secured by a \"potential guarantor\" (Marx opinion, paragraph 12). The Committee does not accept that this assumption constitutes a valid consideration when deciding whether to continue or terminate the stay. In any event, the cost implications for Argentina of any arrangement for security or - as this Committee finally decided - committing funds into an escrow account as tangible proof of future performance, should the annulment application be denied, has already been addressed by the Committee (paragraphs 77 - 79 of its decision). It need not be reopened here.\n\n17.\n\nFurther, Argentina - in its letter of 1 June 2009 - has relied heavily on a decision of 20 May 2009 by the Enron *ad hoc* committee, which decided to continue the stay without the imposition of any conditions. In this regard, Argentina has submitted that placing funds in escrow would create \"unacceptable risk of attachment to Argentina\". The implication is that the funds, if and when released, would run the risk of being applied to satisfy third-party creditors' claims against Argentina rather than be repatriated to Argentina. Such contingency, were it to come to pass, would, in the view of Argentina, render the escrow arrangement irreversible.\n\n18.\n\nThis Committee is prepared to accept that a payor's conditional or residual interest in escrowed funds could, as a matter of fact and law, be attached by third-party creditors in most national jurisdictions (provided the funds would not, in the case of a sovereign state, be held to be immune from such measures).\n\n19.\n\nThis Committee fails, however, to see the relevance of the eventuality that a third-party creditor might attach assets if, and to the extent that, those assets were available for enforcement. The Committee does not see as its function to create safeguards against the possibility of third-party creditors generally obtaining satisfaction in respect of outstanding claims. Nor does the Committee consider that such a contingency would make the envisaged escrow arrangement \"irreversible\". In the event that annulment is granted by the Committee, the funds will revert to Argentina and will be available for purposes of satisfying creditors or otherwise (payment to an insolvent award creditor, on the other hand, may well prove to be irreversible in the event of that creditor's bankruptcy or dissolution).2\n\nApart from generally pointing to the risk of non-recoupment from an award creditor (Memorial on the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award of 7 November 2008, paragraphs 33 and 34), Argentina has not offered any specific indication that this would represent an actual risk in respect of Sempra. Sempra has undertaken - most recently in its letter of 16 July 2009 - to keep any funds received in satisfaction of the Award in a separate escrow account pending the decision in the present annulment proceedings.\n\n20.\n\nAs stated, the Committee does not see why its decision should be influenced by any desire to shield assets from being attached to satisfy any indebtedness to third parties. Such contingencies are outside the scope of considerations which an *ad hoc* committee should take into account.\n\n21.\n\nAs was expressed in the Committee's decision on continuation of the stay, the condition imposed by the Committee upon continued stay of enforcement was motivated by the Committee's consideration that a continued stay would require some \"tangible demonstration of good faith\" that Argentina would comply with its obligations under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n22.\n\nThe Committee has no option other than to conclude, under the present circumstances, that it has received no indication that Argentina's position on Articles 53 and 54 of the Convention has changed, or that it will comply with its obligations under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n23.\n\nThe Committee notes that Argentina has failed to place in escrow the amount of USD75 million within 120 days from the Committee's decision and that this situation has remained despite Sempra's bringing the unresolved situation to the attention of the Committee. Furthermore, the Committee notes that Sempra, in its letter of 10 June 2009, has requested that the Committee order the termination of the present stay of enforcement. In these circumstances, the Committee must conclude that Argentina has not complied with the condition imposed by the Committee for continuing the stay for the duration of these annulment proceedings. For this reason the currently ongoing stay of enforcement of the Award will be terminated.\n\n24.\n\nIn its letter of 29 April 2009, Argentina raised the issue of \"execution measures\" taken by Sempra in France and Spain. In particular, Argentina referred to a notification by the Tribunal de Grand Instance in Boulogne-sur-Mer concerning conservatory measures registered in respect of real estate property, belonging to Argentina, dated 19 January 2009, and an application for conservatory measures together with summons to a hearing before the Juzgado de Primera Instancia No. 83 in Madrid on 5 May 2009.\n\n25.\n\nIn its letter of 29 April 2009 Argentina alleges that \"Sempra's actions have meant a *de facto* termination of the stay of enforcement of the Award\".\n\n26.\n\nIn a response of 13 May 2009, Sempra has argued that efforts to obtain conservatory relief is not comparable to enforcement actions, and that, additionally, the Spanish request will be acted upon only after the deadline for the escrow has elapsed. In this respect, Sempra has emphasized that it has voluntarily re-scheduled the initial hearing in the Spanish application until 15 September 2009.\n\n27.\n\nIn its letter of 1 June 2009, Argentina again claims that Sempra's actions constitute a manifest violation of the stay of enforcement, and considers that those actions imply that the stay has effectively been terminated.\n\n28.\n\nThe Committee notes that the matter of enforcement issues was discussed on the occasion of the hearing on stay,3 and that the Committee required that \"[o]nce the escrow arrangement is established the Committee requires that whatever enforcement, attachment or conservatory measures Sempra ha[d] so far initiated should not be pursued\" (paragraph 116 of the Decision).\n\nDecision of 5 March 2009, paragraphs 86 and 87\n\n29.\n\nAs regards Argentina\u2019s reference to \"execution measures\", the Committee considers that such measures must be distinguished from conservatory measures which will normally be effected where a judicial decision has not yet become final (or judicial proceedings even initiated).\n\n30.\n\nFrom the materials available to the Committee, and based on Sempra\u2019s affirmation that a hearing on the Spanish application has been scheduled for 15 September 2009, the Committee finds no basis to conclude that Sempra, in breach of the Committee\u2019s requirement, has \"pursued\" any request for conservatory measures. Additionally, the Committee considers that, in view of its decision to discontinue the stay on the basis of the absence of any implementation of an escrow arrangement by Argentina, the matter of conservatory or enforcement measures will lose its relevance.\n\n31.\n\nOn the basis of all the foregoing considerations, this Committee renders the following\n\nDECISION\n--------\n\nThe stay of enforcement of the Award is terminated as of the date of this decision."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Argentine Republic's Application for Annulment of the Award", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Argentine Republic's Application for Annulment of the Award\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **ABBREVIATIONS USED IN THIS DECISION** | |\n| **Arbitration Rules** | Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| **Argentina** | Argentine Republic |\n| **Award** | *Sempra Energy International v.

The Application for Annulment was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n2.\n\nIn its Application, Argentina sought annulment of the Award on fom of the five grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically claiming that:\n\n(i) The Tribunal was not properly constituted (\n\nICSID Convention, Article 52(1)(a));\n\n(ii) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (ICSID Convention, Article 52(1)(b);\n\n(iii) There had been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (ICSID Convention, Article 52(1)(d)); and\n\n(iv) The Award had failed to state the reasons on which it was based (\n\nICSID Convention, Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n3.\n\nThe Application for Annulment also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(1) for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment was decided.\n\n4.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on 30 January 2008 and on the same date, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(2), transmitted a Notice of Registration to the Parties. The Parties were also notified that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of 15 September 2008, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2), the Parties were notified by the Centre that an *ad hoc* committee (\"the Committee\") had been constituted, composed of Mr Christer Soderlund, from Sweden, Sir David A.O. Edward, QC, from the United Kingdom, and Ambassador Andreas J. Jacovides, from Cyprus, each of them appointed by their respective countries to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators. On the same date the Parties were informed that Mr Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n6.\n\nOn 16 September 2008, Sempra filed a request to lift the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 25 September 2008, the Parties were notified that Mr Christer S\u00f3derlund had been designated President of the Committee.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 10 October 2008, the Committee proposed to hold a first session by telephone conference on 21 October 2008. A provisional agenda for the session was attached to the letter. The Parties were also notified that the Committee had decided to continue the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award until 8 December 2008, the date fixed by the Committee to hear the Parties\u2019 oral pleadings on stay.\n\n9.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held, as proposed, on 21 October 2008 by telephone conference. At the session, Sempra was represented by Messrs Craig S. Miles and Roberto Aguirre Luzi and by Ms Kerrie A. Nanni, from the law firm of King & Spalding LLP (Houston). The Argentine Republic was represented by Dr Gabriel Bottini and Dra Gisela Makowski from *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina.*\n\n10.\n\nDining the first session: (a) the Parties expressed their agreement that the Committee had been duly constituted, in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and confirmed that they had no objections to any of its members; (b) several issues of procedure were agreed and decided; and (c) the Committee informed the Parties of its decision to continue the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award until a decision on this matter was taken by the Committee. Scheduling arrangements which could not be agreed during the course of the first session were resolved by the Parties shortly after.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the Parties\u2019 agreement, Argentina filed its observations on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award on 7 November 2008 and Sempra filed its observations on 21 November 2008.\n\n12.\n\nOn 8 December 2008, a hearing was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C., at which the Parties presented oral arguments on the matter of *stay of enforcement.* Present at the hearing were: the Members of the Annulment Committee: Mr Christer S\u00f3derlund, Sir David A.O. Edward, QC, and Ambassador Andreas J. Jacovides; the Secretary of the Committee: Mr Gonzalo Flores; Sempra\u2019s representatives: Messrs R. Doak Bishop, Craig S. Miles and Roberto Aguirre Luzi of King & Spalding LLP (Houston); Mr Mark Clodfelter and Ms Maria Kostytska Scala, of Winston & Strawn LLP (Washington, D.C.) and Mr Dave O. Smith of Sempra Energy International; and representatives of the Argentine Republic:\n\nDr Gustavo Adolfo Scrinzi, *Sub-Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina,* Dr Gabriel Bottini, Dr Ignacio Torterola, Dr Alejandro Turyn and Dr Alejandro Agust\u00edn Vasquez Azpilicueta, from Argentina\u2019s *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n.*\n\nMessrs Bishop, Miles, Aguirre Luzi and Clodfelter addressed the Committee on behalf of Sempra. Messrs Scrinzi, Bottini and Torterola did so on behalf of Argentina.\n\n13.\n\nOn 18 December 2008, Sempra wrote to the Committee, claiming that Argentina had \"again refused to change its interpretation of its obligations under Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention\", referring to the *Vivendi ad hoc* committee\u2019s request for a \"comfort letter\"1 and to Argentina\u2019s response to that committee of 28 November 2008. By letter of 29 December 2008 Argentina declared its readiness to provide comments on Sempra\u2019s 18 December submission while, at the same time, describing its letter to the Vivendi *ad hoc* committee as \"self-explanatory\".\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award rendered on 20 August 2007 (4 November 2008).\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of 30 January 2009, Argentina notified the Committee of its intent to adduce additional written testimony into the proceeding. By letter dated 6 February 2009, Sempra objected, emphasizing that the proposed testimony had been presented to the Sempra Tribunal which had conclusively disposed of it. In a reply letter of 20 February 2009, Argentina opined that the proposed testimony should be admitted as it had a bearing on the allegation that a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure had occurred in the Sempra arbitration.\n\n15.\n\nOn 3 March 2009, Argentina filed its Memorial on Annulment.\n\n16.\n\nThe Committee issued its *Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award* on 5 March 2009. In its decision, the Committee granted a continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award subject to the condition that Argentina place in escrow an amount of USD 75 million. The Committee\u2019s decision further provided that, if Argentina failed to place the sum required in escrow within 120 days from the date of the issuance of the decision, the Committee might - at the request of Sempra - order termination of the stay of enforcement with or without providing an opportunity for Argentina to make up for any failure in payment.\n\n17.\n\nThe Committee further decided on Argentina\u2019s request to adduce additional evidence on 31 March 2009. In its decision, the Committee, invoking ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1), according to which \"[t]he tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence [--]\" and ICSID Arbitration Rule 53, according to which \"[t]the provisions of these Rules shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to any procedure relating to [--] annulment of an award and to the decision of the [\u2014] Committee\", confirmed its power to rule on the admissibility of any evidence invoked by a party to annulment proceedings.\n\n18.\n\nThe Committee, however, noting that the ambit of its review was strictly limited to questions of law relating to the grounds for annulment exhaustively listed in the Convention, rejected Argentina\u2019s application to adduce additional testimony. Specifically, the Committee considered that the proposed evidence could not contribute to elucidating whether or not the Tribunal dealt with certain evidentiary matters in such a manner as to constitute a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n19.\n\nOn 4 May 2009, Sempra filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of 13 May 2009, Sempra requested that the stay of enforcement be lifted. The reason invoked for the request was that Argentina had not agreed to, let alone offered, any escrow agreement, as provided in the Committee\u2019s 5 March decision.\n\n21.\n\nIn particular, Sempra referred to paragraph 119 of the Committee \u2019 s decision, which provided:\n\nIn the event where Sempra considers the escrow arrangement offered by Argentina as unsatisfactory, Sempra may bring this matter to the Committee\u2019s attention by submitting a notice at the relevant time, but no later than 30 (thirty) days before expiry of the time limit set forth above. Argentina shall be entitled to submit comments and take corrective action by reason of such notice. If the Committee considers that the escrow arrangement is unsatisfactory - despite corrective action, if any - the Committee may terminate the stay pursuant to Rule 54(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter of 22 May 2009, the Committee invited Argentina to offer comments on Sempra\u2019s letter of 13 May 2009.\n\n23.\n\nIn a communication of 1 June 2009, Argentina made reference to discussions said to have taken place between Argentina and \"counsel for Sempra\" in the *Enron* case2, *inter alia,* concerning a proposal to put an escrow agreement in place as a condition for continuing the stay in those annulment proceedings. Argentina had explained that such an arrangement as proposed would create \"unacceptable risks of attachment\" to Argentina, pointing to the contingency of other creditors attaching Argentina\u2019s entitlement to lift the amount in escrow, should its application for annulment be granted. Argentina noted, in particular, that the *ad hoc* committee in the *Enron* annulment proceedings had, for reasons given in paragraph 42 of that committee\u2019s decision of 20 May 2009, granted a continuation of the stay without conditions. Argentina requested this Committee to do likewise.\n\n*Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation* (formerly Enron Corporation) and *Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3) - Annulment Proceeding. The law firm of King & Spalding LLP (Houston) represents the claimants in both annulment proceedings.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of 10 June 2009, Sempra expressed its disagreement with the *Enron* committee\u2019s reasoning on the point of third-party attachment risk, emphasizing that, taking such a risk into account \"encourages recalcitrant debtors [\u2014] to continue repudiating their international monetary obligations\", and questioning why Sempra should suffer the consequences of \"Argentina\u2019s unilateral decision to renege on its prior international monetary obligations\".\n\n25.\n\nIn the same letter, Sempra reiterated its request that the Committee lift the stay of enforcement, noting that Argentina had not only failed to \"offer\" an escrow arrangement but had not even responded to a draft escrow agreement proposed by Sempra, let alone committed any funds into such escrow.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter of 17 June 2009, the Committee stated that it would consider the Parties\u2019 arguments on the matter of the ongoing stay and issue a decision in respect of the Sempra\u2019s request that the stay now be lifted. Fmther, the Committee invited the Parties to communicate \"any new development or other circumstances, which may be relevant for the matters presently pending\".\n\n27.\n\nOn 29 June 2009, the Argentine Republic filed its Reply on Annulment.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter of 16 July 2009, Sempra asked the Committee to lift the stay of enforcement of the Award. Argentine immediately filed a response on 17 July 2009.\n\n29.\n\nThe Committee issued its *Decision on Sempra Energy International\u2019s Request for the Termination of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award (Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules)* on 7 August 2009. The Committee terminated the stay of enforcement of the Award, dismissing Argentina\u2019s argument that the placing of funds in escrow (or issuing a letter of credit) would cause prohibitive cost and create an \"unacceptable risk of attachment to Argentina\". In doing so, the Committee noted that: (a) the circumstances invoked by Argentina did not amount to economic hardship that would constitute a valid consideration when deciding whether to continue or terminate the stay (as already decided in its 5 March decision; paragraphs 77-79); and (b) that it does not \"see as its function to create safeguards against the possibility of third-party creditors generally obtaining satisfaction in respect of outstanding claims. [...] [s]uch contingencies are outside the scope of considerations which an *ad hoc* committee should take into account\". Argentina not having complied with the condition imposed by the Committee for continuing the stay for the duration of this proceeding, the stay of enforcement of the Award was terminated.\n\n30.\n\nOn 13 August 2009, Sempra filed its Rejoinder on annulment.\n\n31.\n\nA 3-day hearing was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on 1-3 September 2009, at which counsel for both Parties presented their arguments and submissions, and responded to questions from the Members of the Committee. Present at the hearing were: the Members of the Annulment Committee and its Secretary. On behalf of Sempra attended: Messrs R. Doak Bishop, Craig S. Miles and Roberto Aguirre Luzi and Mrs Silvia Marchili, Kerrie A. Nanni and Carol Tamez of King & Spalding LLP (Houston); and Messrs Dave O. Smith and Santiago Albarracin, from Sempra Energy International. On behalf of the Argentine Republic attended: Dr Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino, Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, Dr Gustavo Adolfo Scrinzi, Sub-Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, Dr Gabriel Bottini, Dr Diego Gosis, Dra Veronica Lavista, Dra Viviana Kluger and Dr Nicol\u00e1s Duhalde, from Argentina\u2019s *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n* and Dr Domenico di Pietro, from Chiomenti Studio Legale. Messrs Bishop, Miles and Aguirre Luzi addressed the Committee on behalf of Sempra. Messrs Scrinzi, Bottini, Gosis, di Pietro and Ms Lavista did so, on behalf of the Argentine Republic.\n\n32.\n\nThe Committee declared the proceeding closed on 7 May 2010. Dining the course of the proceedings, the Members of the Committee deliberated by various means of communication, including a meeting at The Hague on 14 - 16 December 2009, and have taken into account all pleadings, documents and testimony before them.\n\n**THE DISPUTE**\n---------------\n\n33.\n\nIn 1989 Argentina introduced a privatization programme in order to revitalize its economy and put an end to the then ongoing economic crisis. An important facet of this program was the introduction of a legal and regulatory framework by way of the Convertibility Law, introduced in 1991, together with an implementing decree, fixing the Argentine peso (ARS) to the US Dollar (USD) at the exchange rate of one to one.\n\n34.\n\nIn 1992, the natural gas industry was restructured, and the government-owned company *Gas del Estado* was privatized. In this connection, the Gas Law was introduced together with its implementing regulations in the form of the Gas Decree. Within the framework of this regulatory regime, a number of companies were formed for purposes of distribution of gas for residential and commercial users. Sempra invested in two of these gas companies by acquiring an indirect shareholding amounting to 43.09% of Sodigas Pampeana\u2019s and Sodigas Sm\u2019s shares, which, in turn, are the holders of 90% and 86.09%, respectively, of the shares of Camuzzi Gas Pampeana S.A. (\"CGP\") and Camuzzi Gas del Sur (\"CGS\"), *i.e.* the \"Licensees\", two Argentine companies which have been granted licenses for the distribution of gas (hereinafter the \"License(s)\") in 1996.\n\n35.\n\nIn December 2001 a financial crisis erupted in Argentina, and in the period 2001-2002 the Government of Argentina undertook a number of measures which, in the view of Sempra, constituted a wholesale abrogation and repudiation of significant rights and entitlements under the Licenses and other entitlements under the regulatory environment, that had been established within the framework of the Argentine privatization program. Essentially, these rights concerned the Licensees\u2019 entitlement to calculation of tariffs in USD and their semiannual adjustment on the basis of the US Producer Price Index (\"PPI\").\n\n36.\n\nIn January 2002, the Emergency Law was enacted, the currency board system was abrogated, the Argentine economy was pesified - including public service agreements and licences - and all contracts and relationships then in force were, according to the Emergency Law, to be adapted to the new context.\n\n37.\n\nOn the basis of the above-stated circumstances, Sempra filed, on 11 September 2002, a Request for Arbitration under the ICSID Convention, invoking the US-Argentina Bilateral Investment Treaty (\"BIT\").\n\n38.\n\nOn 31 December 2003, Argentina filed objections to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the competence of the Tribunal. On 11 May 2005 the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, wherein it held that the dispute fell under the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n39.\n\nA merits phase in the arbitration followed, and the Award on the merits was dispatched to the Parties on 28 September 2007. In the Award it was held that Argentina had breached the fair and equitable standard and the Umbrella Clause of the BIT. On these bases, Sempra was awarded damages.\n\n40.\n\nOn 25 January 2008 Argentina requested the annulment (and stay of enforcement) of the Award.\n\n**THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------\n\n*A brief summary of Argentina\u2019s Annulment Application*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn this annulment proceeding, Argentina has raised a number of issues with regard to the arbitral proceeding and the Award, each of which, on Argentina\u2019s case, have been dealt with in such a way as to constitute one or more grounds for annulment of the Award in its entirety. The issues raised by Argentina concern the *jus standi* of Sempra to bring claims relating to the Licenses and related rights; alleged impropriety in dealing with Argentina\u2019s proposal for the disqualification of the members of the Tribunal; matters relating to the admission of certain fact witnesses in the arbitration proceeding; interpretation of various terms of the Licenses; and the way in which the Tribunal dealt with the fair and equitable treatment standard and the Umbrella Clause of the BIT.\n\n42.\n\nFinally, as explained in greater detail below, Argentina raised arguments in respect of the way that the Tribunal dealt with emergency under Argentine law, necessity under customary international law and preclusion on the basis of Article XI of the BIT.\n\n43.\n\nIn its application for annulment, Argentina invoked (as already noted in paragraph 2 above) the following grounds for annulment as provided for in the ICSID Convention:\n\n1. The Tribunal was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n2. The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n3. There has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n4. The Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based. (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n**THE ARBITRAL PROCEEDING**\n---------------------------\n\n44.\n\nIn the arbitration Sempra argued that the measures adopted by Argentina in the period 2000 - 2002, initiated by the enactment of the Emergency Law and leading to the pesification of tariffs under that law, the abrogation of the PPI adjustment of tariffs, the unilateral modification of the Licenses without compensation and related matters, amounted to abrogation and repudiation of most of the rights it had under the regulatory framework.\n\n45.\n\nOn this basis, Sempra claimed that Argentina was in breach of specific commitments made to the investors in violation of the applicable legal regulatory norms and the specific guarantees provided under the BIT, seriously impairing the value of its investments.\n\n46.\n\nThe conduct of Argentina constituted, in Sempra\u2019s view, wrongful expropriation of its investment as well as breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, including legitimate expectations, by measures characterized by arbitrary and discriminatory treatment and failure to provide full protection and security, as well as also breaching the BIT\u2019s Umbrella Clause. In sum, according to Sempra, all of the protections offered under the BIT had been breached.\n\n47.\n\nArgentina denied that there had been any breach in respect of the measures it undertook and which have been complained of by Sempra. The legal and regulatory framework governing the privatization provided for the Licensees\u2019 right to fair and reasonable tariffs and the right to calculate tariffs in USD could be applied only as long as the Convertibility Law was in force. Moreover, information that the investors relied on when making their investments was conveyed by private consulting firms and was not attributable to Argentina, which had expressly disclaimed responsibility for such information.\n\n48.\n\nIn Argentina\u2019s view, the legal and regulatory framework had also been strictly upheld when adopting the measures complained of and none of those measures amounted to a breach of the Licenses or the BIT. In any event, Argentina maintained that its responsibility, both under domestic as well as international law concerning necessity, whether customary or treaty-based, is excluded.\n\n49.\n\nAgainst the overall scenario described above, Sempra dealt with a number of specific measures undertaken by Argentina in the context of the economic, social and political difficulties gradually emerging in Argentina at the end of the 1990s and the measures undertaken by Argentina commencing in December of 2001 and gathering momentum in the following year.\n\n*The first claim: PPI adjustment of tariffs*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nAccording to Sempra, adjustments of the tariffs based on the PPI (\"PPI adjustments\") were suspended from 1 July 2000, and permanently.\n\n51.\n\nArgentina denied that the measures undertaken were in any way in breach of any undertaking, but simply represented a reasonable adjustment to the Argentine economy in a situation of recession and deflation, making the adjustments to the license terms justified.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal held that the Licensees had been entitled to PPI adjustments, and that these adjustments had been abrogated by Argentina.\n\n*The second claim: Pesification of tariffs under the Emergency Law*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nOn 6 January 2002 Argentina enacted the Emergency Law, which essentially entailed the abrogation of the Licensees\u2019 right to calculate tariffs in USD and the conversion of tariffs at a fixed rate of exchange of one USD to one ARS.\n\n54.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the calculation of tariffs in USD was linked to the Convertibility Law, which, in turn, was subordinated to the overreaching policy goal that tariffs should be fair and reasonable.\n\n55.\n\nSempra contends that the abrogation of these rights constituted violations of the protections offered by Argentina, in particular, in respect of the fair and equitable treatment standard and the Umbrella Clause.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal, basing itself on an examination of the legal and the regulatory framework, concluded that there was indeed a right for Sempra to calculate tariffs in USD, that this was a central feature of the tariff regime, and that this right was abrogated.\n\n*The third claim: The breach of the Licenses\u2019 stability clauses*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nSempra\u2019s claim in this respect refers, in particular, to contractual provisions of the Licenses prohibiting the freezing of prices, and the duty of the Licensor not to amend the basic rules of the Licenses without written consent of the Licensees. The non-observance of these commitments constituted, in Sempra\u2019s view, a breach of the Umbrella Clause in the BIT.\n\n58.\n\nArgentina argued that the prohibitions referred to were binding only for the executive branch of government and that any measure arising from congressional action would not fall foul of this prohibition.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal, noting that the matter at hand did not concern the State\u2019s right to adjudicate or legislate, but whether the terms of the Licenses gave a right to damages, dismissed Argentina\u2019s argument.\n\n*The fourth claim: Failure to reimburse subsidies*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe fourth claim advanced by Sempra concerns the failure of Argentina to reimburse certain subsidies promised to the Licensees, essentially CGS. Additionally, Sempra considered that such subsidies were to be calculated in USD as being *in lieu* of higher tariffs.\n\n61.\n\nArgentina denied the claim invoking its attempts to regularize the payments of subsidies and the proposition that the situation now is back to normal. As the subsidies, in Argentina\u2019s view, have always been paid in ARS, no conversion into USD is warranted.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that Argentina recognized the amount of subsidies owing before 31 December 2001, and that the monies due must be compensated with the parity exchange value of the ARS to USD at that time.\n\n*The fifth claim: Interference with the collection of bills and related matters*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nSempra argued that a number of measures have caused interference in collection of bills and that other suspensions and impositions have impacted negatively on the operations of the Local Companies.\n\n64.\n\nArgentina rejected the significance of any such measure as being limited and exceptional and, in any event, later reversed.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that it did not find much merit in these \"peripheral\" claims, but that it was prepared to consider them in the context of Sempra\u2019s overall claim for compensation.\n\n*The matter of treaty breaches*\n-------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal held, essentially, that Argentina had not breached the standard of protection established in Article IV(1) of the BIT (expropriation or equivalent).3 The Tribunal held, however, that \"[t]he measures in question\"4 had, beyond any doubt, substantially changed the legal and business framework, under which the investment was decided and implemented and that, as a consequence, the fair and equitable treatment standard of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT had been breached.\n\nAward, para 286\n\nAward, para 303\n\n67.\n\nAs for Sempra\u2019s argument relating to breach of the Umbrella Clause, the Tribunal, opining that the Licenses were \"the ultimate expression of a series of complex investment arrangements made with a specific intention of channeling the influx of capital\",5 concluded that, indeed, the Umbrella Clause in Article II(2)(c) of the BIT was also breached.\n\nAward, para 312\n\n68.\n\nAs for Sempra\u2019s assertion that it had been the victim of arbitrary and discriminatory action from the side of Argentina, the Tribunal concluded that the treatment afforded to Sempra did not appear to have been discriminatory or arbitrary in comparison to measures meted out to other entities or sectors in Argentina and did not, therefore, constitute a breach of the BIT\u2019s protection from arbitrariness and discrimination (Article II(2)(b)).\n\n69.\n\nAs for the claim concerning full protection and security, the Tribunal noted that this particular standard has evolved in the context of physical protection but that also, in given cases, a broader interpretation could be justified. However, the Tribunal saw no reason on the basis of the circumstances of the present case to thus extend this standard of protection and, therefore, rejected Sempra\u2019s claim under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.\n\n*Argentina\u2019s defence based on necessity and preclusion under Article XI of the BIT*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nIn the comse of the arbitration, Argentina also raised the defense of necessity under Argentine law and customary international law as well as the question of preclusion under Article XI of the BIT (in that order).\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal held that the conditions under which emergency might be exercised and legally validated under Argentine law were not present, based on Argentine court precedents, and that \"the very constitutional provisions which were subject to judicial control and which led to the definition of those conditions cannot be invoked to preclude a finding of wrongfulness\".6 Nor did the Tribunal - applying Article 25 of the ILC Articles as an expression of customary international law - find that the cumulative requirements set up by that provision were present in order to excuse wrongfulness. As for preclusion under Article XI of the BIT, the Tribunal held, as will be discussed in greater detail below, that the cumulative requirements for exoneration under Article 25 of the ILC Articles were not satisfied, making it unnecessary, in the view of the Tribunal, to undertake further judicial review under Article XI.\n\nAward, para 330\n\n72.\n\nIn summing up, the Tribunal held that Argentina had incurred liability for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard as well as the Umbrella Clause, and ordered Argentina to pay compensation.\n\n**PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE**\n------------------------------------\n\n*INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS*\n-----------------------\n\n*The scope of review to be undertaken by the Committee*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nAn *ad hoc* committee may only determine whether (a) to annul the Award in whole or in part - rendering the Award (or part thereof) null and void for all intents and purposes, cancelling its *res judicata* effect - or (b) let the Award stand. Annulment is distinct from an appeal. An *ad hoc* committee cannot substitute its own judgement on the merits for the decision of the Tribunal. Following a decision to annul an ICSID Award, the dispute may be resubmitted to new tribunal to obtain a decision on the merits.\n\n74.\n\nAnnulment review is limited to a specific set of carefully defined grounds (listed exhaustively in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention)7. New arguments or evidence on the merits will therefore be irrelevant for the annulment process, and therefore not admissible. It cannot be excluded, however, that evidence, particularly expert evidence, may exceptionally be accepted in annulment proceedings insofar it is specifically relevant for the annulment grounds listed in Article 52(1) of the Convention (insofar invoked by a party).\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c)(iii) also confirms that these grounds are the sole grounds for annulment.\n\n75.\n\nAs for the interpretation of grounds for annulment there is compelling support for the view that neither a narrow nor a broad approach is to be applied.8\n\nAs explained by the *ad hoc* committee in the Klockner arbitration, \"... *application of the paragraph Article 52(1) of the Convention demands neither a narrow interpretation, nor a broad interpretation, but an appropriate interpretation, taking into account the legitimate concern to surround the exercise of the remedy to the maximum extent possible with guarantees in order to achieve a harmonious balance between the various objectives of the Convention. \"* (Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2), Decision on Annulment, 3 May 1985, p 3).\n\n76.\n\nNor is there any preponderant inclination *\"in favorem validitatis\". i.e.* a presumption in favour of the Award\u2019s validity.9 In line with the consistent, but not invariable, practice of *ad hoc* committees, this Committee will not express any views on aspects of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on the merits.\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7), Decision on Annulment of 5 June 2007, para 22, that \"[s]uch presumption [---] finds no basis in the text of Article 52 and has not been used by annulment committees\".\n\n77.\n\nIt is standard practice for applicants seeking annulment to invoke more than one ground for annulment - as has been done in the present case. The Committee sees it as its task to gauge the circumstances invoked in support of each ground independently. The fact that a particular set of facts may have a bearing on more than one ground of annulment does not, as such, render any error alleged in support of anyone of those grounds of annulment any the more manifest.\n\n78.\n\nOnce an **ad hoc** committee has concluded that there is one instance of manifest excess of powers (or any other ground for annulment), which warrants annulment of the Award in its entirety, this will be the end of the **ad hoc** committee\u2019s examination. Since annulment of an award in its entirety necessarily leads to the loss of the *res judicata* effect of all matters adjudicated by the Tribunal, it is unnecessary to consider whether there are other grounds - whether in respect of the same matter or other matters - that may also lead to annulment.\n\n79.\n\nOn the other hand, an **ad hoc** committee will need to proceed differently where it decides not to annul the Award or decides to annul the Award only in part. In those instances it will be necessary for the **ad hoc** committee to examine all of the grounds invoked by the applicant in support of its application.\n\n80.\n\nThe question arises whether different considerations apply where the matters of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence have been put in issue. In other words, if the affirmation of jurisdiction by the Tribunal is alleged to constitute a manifest excess of powers (or any other ground for annulment), does this question have to be addressed as a preliminary issue (and dismissed), before considering grounds of annulment invoked by the applicant in respect of other aspects of the Award or the arbitral proceedings? The argument for taking this course would be that, if the dispute fell outside the jurisdiction of the Centre and, therefore, outside the competence of the Tribunal, the conduct of the Tribunal in procedmal and substantive respects would not be relevant.\n\n81.\n\nThe contrary argument would be that, since no decision of an *ad hoc* committee (or any reasoning underlying it) can have no effect other than upholding or (partially) annulling the Award, the reasons given by the **ad hoc** committee for its decision, while decisive for its conclusions, will not be binding on a new Tribunal upon resubmission of the case. Thus, if an **ad hoc** committee has found that a Tribunal\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction is the result of an error justifying annulment of the Award, a new tribunal may nevertheless declare itself competent to deal with the case.\n\n82.\n\nIn the present case, although the Committee has come to the conclusion that the Award must be annulled on another ground, it considers that, on balance, it is desirable that it should deal with Argentina\u2019s argument on jurisdiction as a preliminary matter.\n\n**JURISDICTION**\n----------------\n\n**Introduction**\n----------------\n\n83.\n\nIn the arbitration, Argentina disputed the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on a number of grounds, *inter alia,* Sempra\u2019s lack of *jus standi,* arguing, essentially, that Sempra\u2019s claims were connected to the Licensees and not directly to its investment, as any alleged violation complained of was susceptible of affecting the Licensees only.\n\n84.\n\nSempra contended that all requirements under the ICSID Convention and the BIT for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction were present, *i.e.,* essentially, that there was a legal dispute between a national of the United States and Argentina concerning losses, that these affected the interest of Sempra in the Licensees, and that both parties have consented to ICSID arbitration.\n\n85.\n\nArgentina, referring to the second part of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, further argued that of the Tribunal should apply \"domestic legislation and international law\".10 Sempra argued that it is the ICSID Convention and the BIT that should be applied to determine jmisdiction.11\n\nArgentina\u2019s position is dealt with in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, para 25\n\nId, para 26\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal confirmed12 that Article 42(1) applies to the merits of the dispute only, so only Article 25 of the Convention and the terms of the BIT should be applied.\n\nId, para 27\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that also a non-controlling shareholder is an investor under the terms of the BIT. further, the Tribunal held that Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention establishes an *optional* jurisdictional alternative and not, as argued by Argentina, an autonomous jurisdictional requirement.13\n\nThis option evidently was open under Article VII(8) of the BIT.\n\n88.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal noted that, contrary to Argentina\u2019s argument, Sempra alleged that it had suffered a direct loss. The Tribunal also concluded that there was an (alleged) loss, arising directly to Sempra\u2019s investment, giving Sempra a cause of action under the BIT.\n\n89.\n\nAs for Argentina\u2019s claim that Sempra lacks *jus standi, i.e.* that it is bringing a derivative action on behalf of the Licensees, the Tribunal concluded that, on Sempra\u2019s case, it was pursuing its own rights under the BIT. The Tribunal concluded that a cause of action also accrues to a minority shareholder,14 and that a cause of action lies under the BIT.15\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, para 91.\n\nThe matter of investors\u2019 jus *standi* under, *inter alia,* the US-Argentina BIT has been discussed also in other, previous ICSID cases, see *e.g.* *Enron v. Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Jurisdiction (2 August 2004), *CMS Gas Transmission Co. v.

Firstly, the Tribunal accepted \"the claim of a shareholder with respect to the alleged damage to rights belonging to the companies in which it held and holds shares\". Secondly, Argentina raised the \"potential problem that, in both situations, might arise in the event of double compensation\".17 In this latter respect, Argentina referred to the contingency that the subsidiaries themselves might have actionable claims, premised on the Licenses and other contractual rights, claims which are also comprised by the present claim by Sempra under the BIT. Argentina further contended that the Tribunal failed to appreciate the fact that the Licenses and other contractual rights were entered into between the Licensees and Argentina, and not with Sempra when considering Sempra\u2019s claims, while, at the same time, disregarding agreements between Argentina and the Licensees as *res inter alios acta.*\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para 48\n\n92.\n\nThe fact that the Tribunal failed to state grounds for its Decision on Jurisdiction by which it accepted the jurisdiction of ICSID and its own competence also amounts, in the view of Argentina, to a failure to state reasons on which these decisions were based, which warrants annulment of the Award.\n\n**SEMPRA\u2019S POSITION**\n---------------------\n\n93.\n\nSempra has rejected Argentina\u2019s affirmations related to alleged absence of *jus standi* mainly on the following grounds.\n\n94.\n\nThe question whether a particular investment qualifies for protection is determined by the relevant instrument on investment protection, in this case the BIT. According to the Article I(ii) of the BIT, \"shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof\u2019 constitute, *inter alia,* investments within the meaning of that BIT.\n\n95.\n\nAccording to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention \"a national of another Contracting State\" constitutes an investor under the Convention; hence, Sempra qualifies as such.\n\n96.\n\nSempra is claiming for its own rights under the BIT and is not pursuing a derivative action for the account of the Licensees, from this follows that Sempra is an investor which has made an investment under the BIT.\n\n97.\n\nThe potential of double recovery is not relevant for the question of jurisdiction. In any event, this risk is not present.\n\n98.\n\nDamages claimed by Sempra, and awarded by the Tribunal, concern its own damages and not those of the Licensees.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on the matter of jurisdiction is firmly based on the provisions of the Convention and the BIT; there is no excess of powers, let alone manifest, or failure to state reasons.\n\n**THE COMMITTEE\u2019S CONCLUSION ON JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre is determined by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, and is governed by the terms of the instrument expressing the parties\u2019 consent to arbitration. In the present case, the relevant instruments are, in the case of Argentina, the BIT, and in the case of Sempra, its request for arbitration.\n\n101.\n\nBecause Article 25 of the Convention does not define \"investment\", that task was \"left largely to the terms of bilateral investment treaties or other instruments on which jurisdiction is based\".18 The BIT provides in its Article I(i), *inter alia'.*\n\nLor the purposes of this Treaty,\n\n(a) \"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt and service and investment contracts; and includes without limitation:\n\n[-]\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;\n\n(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value and directly related to an investment;\n\n[-]\n\n(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law.\n\nThe quotation is taken from the *CMS* Annulment Decision, para 71.\n\n102.\n\nThe plain language of the BIT is evidence of the broad meaning of the term \"investment\" envisaged by the contracting parties when entering into the BIT. Notably, the definition explicitly includes \"investment contracts\", \"shares of stock or other interests in a company\", and \"any right conferred by law or contract\", \"owned or controlled directly or indirectly\".\n\n103.\n\nThe Committee is clearly of the opinion that Sempra is entitled to bring a claim under the ICSID Convention against Argentina in respect of damage allegedly caused to Sempra\u2019s \"investment\" in Argentina, *i.e.* its indirect, minority shareholdings in the Local Companies. The **Barcelona Traction** case, and the principle confirming the recognition under international law of the personality of juridical entities under municipal law, are irrelevant in the present BIT context. Shareholders may claim under the BIT - as distinct from what was the case in the **Barcelona Traction** case -simply because this BIT extends such rights to \"investors\" as defined therein, a right which does not exist under customary international law.\n\n104.\n\nIn the opinion of the Committee, the arguments advanced by Argentina in support of its objection to jurisdiction confuse two distinct issues.\n\nThe first issue is whether Sempra is entitled to bring a claim under the ICSID Convention and the BIT in respect of alleged damage to its **investment** through loss caused to its partly and indirectly owned Local Companies, CGP and CGS, by impairment of Licenses and other valuable rights held by those subsidiaries. The second is whether acts or omissions on the part of Argentina with respect to CGP or CGS have in fact caused damage to Sempra\u2019s **investment** and, if so, what is the proper measure of that damage. The first issue is one of jurisdiction, while the second issue relates to the merits of the dispute. In the present case, if Sempra were to be found entitled to reparation for damage to its investment, the measure of damages would not necessarily be directly proportionate to any pecuniary loss or deficit suffered by CGP or CGS. That being an issue on the merits, the Committee does not consider it further.\n\n105.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal has neither engaged in any manifest excess of powers nor failed to state reasons on the matter of the *jus standi* of Sempra.\n\n**EMERGENCY UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**ARGENTINA\u2019S POSITION**\n------------------------\n\n*Article XI of the BIT*\n-----------------------\n\n106.\n\nArgentina has submitted that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers by failing to apply Article XI of the BIT. Argentina has based its position on, essentially, the following circumstances.\n\n107.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal determined that Article XI is not self-judging and, consequently, it was incumbent on the Tribunal to carry out a substantial review of its applicability. However, the Tribunal held that Article XI does not establish conditions other than those that follow from the state of necessity under customary international law as enunciated in Article 25 of the ILC Articles. The Tribunal concluded -as follows from its Award19 - that, having previously determined that the Argentine crisis did not meet the requirements of the state of necessity under customary international law, it would not undertake further judicial review under Article XI.\n\nAward, paras 378 and 388\n\n108.\n\nFrom this follows that the Tribunal failed to distinguish between Article XI of the BIT and the state of necessity under customary international law.\n\n*Differences between Article XI of the BIT and the state of necessity*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nArgentina has developed its position on the question of the Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to apply Article XI of the BIT in the following way.\n\n110.\n\nIn the Award20, the Tribunal considered that \"[t]he BIT provision is inseparable from the customary law standard insofar as the definition of necessity and the conditions for its operation are concerned\" and that Article XI \"does not set out conditions different from customary law in such regard\".\n\nPara 376\n\n111.\n\nHowever, Article XI of the BIT differs significantly from the state of necessity under customary international law, which is substantially contained in Article 25 of the ILC Articles. This fact requires that this difference is observed in view of the potentially different outcomes of an evaluation of Article XI as opposed to Article 25 of the ILC Articles, and more importantly, it makes it manifest that the Tribunal has failed to embark on an interpretation of Article XI.\n\n112.\n\nThe main differences between Article XI and the state of necessity under customary international law relate to the sphere of operation of these rules, to their nature and operation, their content, scope, and, as well as to their effects.\n\n113.\n\nArticle XI is a special conventional rule, while the state of necessity is a general rule of customary international law. Therefore, Article XI may only be invoked within the framework of the BIT. It is a specific provision, bilaterally agreed upon by the contracting States, which delimits the scope of the protections contained in that BIT. On the other hand, the state of necessity \"can be invoked in any context against any international obligation\",21 except for obligations excluding the possibility of invoking the state of necessity.\n\nQuoted from the Continental Casualty Award, para 167; *Continental Casualty Company* v. *Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9), Award of 5 September 2008.\n\n114.\n\nThe plea of necessity under customary international law is subsidiary to that of Article XI of the BIT. Article XI is a provision that delimits the scope of application of that BIT: \"if it applies, the substantive obligations under the BIT do not apply\".22 By contrast, \"Article 25 is an excuse, which is relevant only if it has been decided that there has otherwise been a breach of those substantive obligations under the BIT\".23\n\nCMS Annulment Decision, para 129\n\nId., para 129.\n\n115.\n\nArticle XI is a primary rule, since it delimits the scope of the substantive obligations of the BIT itself. If the requirements under Article XI are met, there is no breach of the BIT. Article 25 is a secondary rule, since it provides discharge from responsibility of the State for internationally wrongful acts. It is a \u2018\"ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation\u2019, under certain strict conditions\"24. The state of necessity does not extinguish or terminate the obligation, but excludes responsibility for its non-performance.\n\nContinental Casualty Award, para 166\n\n116.\n\nTherefore, only if conduct violates the BIT by infringing a standard of treatment and such conduct is not precluded under Article XI, can the question arise whether the responsibility of the State is excluded by virtue of the state of necessity.\n\n117.\n\nArticle XI does not include the stringent requirements of the state of necessity. There is no equivalent to the Article 25 standard of \"grave and imminent peril\" amongst the exceptions provided for in Article XI or to the requirement that the measure be \"the only way for the State to safeguard\" its interests, or that the State invoking the exception must not have contributed to the situation of necessity.\n\n118.\n\nFinally, the preclusion under Article XI and the state of necessity differ as to their effects. In the case of the state of necessity, Article 27 of the ILC Articles provides that \"[T]he invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness... is without prejudice to... [t]he question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question\". If, however, Article XI is found to apply, no compensation is payable since such provision excludes \"the operation of the substantive provisions of the BIT\"\n\n*Grounds for annulment*\n-----------------------\n\n119.\n\nThere are, in Argentina\u2019s view, three grounds for annulment in connection with the manner in which the Tribunal dealt with Article XI of the BIT, namely: (a) manifest errors of law; (b) manifest excess of powers; and (c) failure to state reasons.\n\n120.\n\nFirstly, the Tribunal made manifest errors of law in equating Article XI of the BIT with the state of necessity under customary international law, in assuming that these provisions were on the same footing, and in applying the rule of Article 27 of the ILC Articles to Article XI. Secondly, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by its failure to apply Article XI. Finally, the Tribunal failed to explain the reasons why it could refrain from applying Article XI and instead apply rules on state of necessity under customary international law.\n\n*Manifest errors of law*\n------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal made manifest errors of law when dealing with Article XI by declaring that \"[s]incc the Tribunal has found above that the crisis invoked does not meet the customary law requirements of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, it concludes that necessity or emergency is not conducive in this case to the preclusion of wrongfulness, and that there is no need to undertake a further judicial review under Article XI, given that this Article does not set out conditions different from customary law in such regard\"25.\n\nAward, para 388\n\n122.\n\nBy equating Article XI of the BIT with ILC Article 25, and assuming they were on the same footing, the Tribunal committed manifest errors of law.\n\n123.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal also made another manifest error of law by applying the rule of ILC Article 27 to Article XI of the BIT.\n\n124.\n\nAlthough Argentina admits, in principle, that a mere error of law is not a ground for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, in certain circumstances, an error of law may be sufficiently serious to qualify as a manifest excess of powers for failure to apply the proper law.\n\n125.\n\nThe manifest errors of law that are present in the Award in the instant case, are sufficiently serious to amount to a manifest excess of powers in accordance with Article 52(1)b of the ICSID Convention for failure to apply the proper law.\n\n*Manifest excess of powers*\n---------------------------\n\n126.\n\nNot only did the Tribunal make manifest errors of law in connection with Article XI of the BIT, but it also engaged in a manifest excess of powers by its failure to apply that provision. Applying Article XI entailed recognising its self-judging nature, thus respecting the decision of Argentina to take measures under cover of that article. However, if such article was deemed not to be self-judging, it would call for a substantive review of the measures adopted by Argentina in order to verify whether those measures satisfied the substantive standards for preclusion that are enunciated in this provision. The Tribunal did not accept the self-judging nature of Article XI of the BIT, nor did it perform a substantive review. The Tribunal simply replaced Article XI of the BIT with the state of necessity under customary international law which, as explained, differs substantially from the former as to its sphere of operation, nature and functioning, content, scope and effects. The Tribunal did not apply Article XI of the BIT, thus manifestly exceeding its powers.\n\n*The self-judging nature of the Article XI of the BIT*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal was called to apply Article XI, which provision, in Argentina\u2019s view, would apply in a situation such as the one that evolved in Argentina as from late 2001. This imposed on the Tribunal a duty to defer to Argentina\u2019s decision to take measures to maintain public order and protect its essential security interests, since Article XI is self-judging. The State invoking a provision such as Article XI of the BIT is the sole judge of its applicability to the contested measures. By disregarding the self-judging nature of Article XI, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n*Replacing Article XI with the state of necessity*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nIn the Award the Tribunal concluded that Article XI of the BIT was not self-judging and that a substantive review was required.26\n\nAward, para 388\n\n129.\n\nSuch a substantive review would have, as its object, an examination of the standards contained in Article XI in order to ascertain whether the requirements of that provision were present. However, instead of proceeding to such substantive review, the Tribunal decided not to apply Article XI and replaced that provision with Article 25 of the ILC Articles, *i.e.* by a rule of customary international law.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal even acknowledged explicitly that it would not apply Article XI by stating that there was no \"need to undertake a further judicial review under Article XI\"27. This declaration represents a conclusive indication of the manifest excess of powers, in which the Tribunal engaged in abstaining from applying this BIT provision.\n\nAward, para 388\n\n131.\n\nThe fact that Argentina also invoked the state of necessity in the arbitration did not allow the Tribunal to disregard Article XI of the BIT and to apply, in its place, Article 25 of the ILC Articles. The Tribunal should have undertaken an examination of the requirements of the state of necessity as a ground for precluding wrongfulness only if Article XI of the BIT was held not to apply, and a violation under that BIT had been established.\n\n*Failure to state reasons*\n--------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal failed to state reasons pmsuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention in respect of two fundamental issues regarding Article XI of the BIT. The Tribunal did not explain why the lack of a definition in that BIT of the substantive standard of \"essential security interests\" made it necessary to rely on the requirements of the state of necessity under customary international law. Nor did the Tribunal explain why Article XI did not establish conditions different from the requirements under customary international law set forth in Article 25 of ILC Articles.\n\n133.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal stated that in the absence of a definition of what is to be understood by an \"essential security interest\", the requirements of a state of necessity under customary international law, as expressed in Article 25 of the ILC Articles, become relevant to the matter of establishing whether the necessary conditions have been met for its invocation under the BIT28.\n\nAward, para 375\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal did not explain in the Award why the lack of a definition of \"essential security interests\" of Article XI led to the application of the requirements of the state of necessity under customary international law in place of the BIT provision.\n\n135.\n\nIn conclusion, by failing to explain why the lack of a definition of \"essential security interests\" in Article XI led to application of the requirements of the state of necessity instead of Article XI, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which it based its decision in the terms of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. The Award should therefore be annulled on this ground.\n\n**SEMPRA\u2019S POSITION**\n---------------------\n\n136.\n\nSempra has firmly rejected the notion that the Tribunal committed any excess of powers by any failure to interpret or apply Article XI of the BIT, or failed to state reasons for its conclusions in this regard.\n\nNothing regarding the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of Argentina\u2019s Article XI and necessity defences constitutes a ground for annulment.\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal correctly interpreted and applied Article XI as well as Argentina\u2019s defence of necessity. It found that Argentina had means available other than the Emergency Law to address its economic crisis, and that it substantially contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the economic crisis. Moreover, Argentina\u2019s annulment request is based on new arguments and material that post-date the Award. Therefore, these objections should be rejected.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s mission was to interpret and apply Article XI and Argentina\u2019s defence based on state of necessity under customary international law. This the Tribunal did. It analyzed Article XI and concluded that because of its lack of clarity, and the fact that it reflects customary international law, a state invoking Article XI must satisfy the same conditions required to invoke the defence of necessity. The Tribunal explained that it reached its interpretation of Article XI because: (i) the BIT\u2019s object and purpose requires a narrow interpretation of Article XI; (ii) Article XI does not contain any definition of the terms \"essential security interests\" or \"necessary\";\n\n(iii) Article XI reflects customary international law; and (iv) relevant rules of international law should be used to interpret BIT provisions that either reflect customary international law or are not defined in the BIT. The Tribunal interpreted Article XI in accordance with relevant rules of treaty interpretation, as codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.\n\n139.\n\nAs follows from the Award, the Tribunal rejected Argentina\u2019s defence based on Article XI because: (i) the Emergency Law was not necessary to maintain \"public order\" or protect Argentina\u2019s \"essential security interests\", and (ii) there were other means available to maintain \"public order\" and to protect Argentina\u2019s \"essential security interests\".\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal found that \"there was a severe crisis\", but that this crisis had not \"compromised the very existence of the State and its independence, thereby qualifying as one involving an essential state interest\".29 The Tribunal stated that \"[q]uestions of public order and social unrest could be handled as in fact they were, just as questions of political stabilization were handled under the constitutional arrangement in force\".30\n\nAward, para 348\n\nAward, para 348\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that (i) \"there is no convincing evidence that the events were out of control or had become unmanageable\" and\n\n(ii) that its task under the BIT was to find whether the Emergency Law was the \"only\" alternative to address the economic crisis.31 The Tribunal held that \"this does not appear to have been the case\",32 and therefore, there was more than one alternative to maintain \"public order\" or protect its \"essential security interests\"\n\nAward, paras 349-350\n\nAward, para 351\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected Argentina\u2019s argument that it had not contributed to the crisis. The Tribunal first concluded that a \"State cannot invoke necessity if it has contributed to the situation giving rise to a state of necessity\".33 The Tribunal found this was an \"expression of a general principle of law devised to prevent a party taking legal advantage of its own fault\".34 Thus, it did not just base its finding on Article XI or customary international law, but on a general principle of law. The Tribunal concluded that Argentina could not succeed in its defence under Article XI or the defence of necessity, if it had contributed to the situation of necessity, and based on the evidence produced by the Parties, the Tribunal concluded that in fact Argentina had made a \"substantial contribution\" to the state of necessity alleged by Argentina as its basis for invoking Article XI and the defence of necessity.\n\nAward, para 353\n\nAward, para 353\n\n143.\n\nAdditionally, in respect of the specific grounds invoked by Argentina for annulment of the Award, Sempra has submitted the following.\n\n*A manifest error of law is not a ground for annulment*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nIn respect of Argentina\u2019s invocation of a manifest error of law, Sempra summarizes its case by noting that a manifest error of law is not a ground for annulment. Moreover, Sempra adds, even if manifest error of law could constitute a ground for annulment, it is not present in this context; the Tribunal interpreted the law correctly.\n\n*The Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nSempra relies on the fact that the Tribunal agreed that \"[t]he requirement for a state of necessity under customary international law, as outlined above in connection with their expression in Article 25 of the ILC Articles, become relevant to the matter of establishing whether the necessary conditions have been met for its invocation under the BIT\".35\n\nAward, para 375\n\n146.\n\nThe Sempra Tribunal also rejected the criticism raised by Argentina against the way the *CMS* Tribunal addressed Article XI and necessity, concluding that the definition of necessity and the conditions for its operations are inseparable, having regard to the fact that it is under customary law that such elements have been defined.\n\n147.\n\nAs for Argentina\u2019s invocation of Article XI as *lex specialis,* the Tribunal accepted that \" [i]t is no doubt correct to conclude that a treaty regime specifically dealing with a given matter will prevail over more general rules of customary law\".36 However, as the BIT text did not provide sufficient guidance, the Tribunal considered customary international law the most appropriate means to interpret the BIT provision.\n\nAward, para 378\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal held that the conditions under which Article XI of the BIT and the state of necessity under customary international law may be invoked are the same. The Tribunal reiterated this point when it rejected Argentina\u2019s self-judging argument by explaining that: \"The judicial control must be a substantive one, and concerned with whether the requirements under customary law or the BIT have been met and can thereby preclude wrongfulness. [Because the Tribunal rejected the customary international law necessity defence] there is no need to undertake a further judicial review under Article XI given that this Article does not set out conditions different from customary law in such regard\".37\n\nAward, para 388\n\n149.\n\nSempra has also referred to the following circumstances. Article X of the BIT provides that \"[t]his Treaty shall not derogate from:...\n\nb) international legal obligations... that entitle investments or associated activities to treatment more favourable than that accorded by this Treaty in like situations\".38 Thus, the BIT\u2019s object and purpose indicate an intent not to interpret particular BIT provisions in a manner that accords investments less protection than that provided under customary international law.\n\nAward, para 431\n\n150.\n\nIn addition, Sempra recalls, the BIT contains several gateways to international law, setting it as the floor below which treatment cannot be afforded, unless required under the BIT. For example, Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, provides that the treatment afforded by the BIT cannot be \"less than that required by international law\". Furthermore, Article 42 of the ICSID Convention imposes on the Tribunal a duty to apply international law. Thus, the BIT cannot be seen as a separate and independent instrument, but as a creature of the international law regime, which at the same time is the applicable law that governs the BIT.\n\n151.\n\nSempra does not agree either that Article XI and the defence of necessity under customary international differ in a number of fundamental ways as argued by Argentina. Moreover, Argentina did not present these arguments to the Tribunal, which should suffice to reject this claim.\n\n152.\n\nSempra does not accept Argentina\u2019s affirmation that the content of Article XI and Article 25 are different, and that there is no \"textual link\" to customary law in Article XI, on the grounds: (a) that there is no textual equivalent to \"grave and imminent peril\"; (b) that Article XI does not require that a \"necessary\" measure be the \"only way\" to achieve the covered pmpose; and (c) that there is no requirement in Article XI that the State not have contributed to the situation necessitating the measure.\n\n153.\n\nArticle XI reflects customary international law, a self-contained regime which must be used to interpret Article XI. Also, various elements of Article XI actually reflect international law, and not just the state defence of necessity, but also distress and *force majeure.*\n\n154.\n\nArticle XI is limited to maintenance of peace, \"essential security interests\", and public order. Article 25, on the other hand, only provides that the State interest must be an \"essential interest of the State\", meaning that Article XI is not more expansive than customary law.\n\n155.\n\nSempra also does not accept Argentina\u2019s assertion that Article XI and Article 25 are different, the latter (but not the former) being without prejudice to compensation. It is, in any event, irrelevant to the question whether the conditions under which Article XI and the customary necessity plea can be invoked are the same or not.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal did not refrain from applying Article XI, but interpreted this provision as requiring a State invoking it to satisfy the same conditions as required to invoke the plea of necessity under customary law. The Tribunal interpreted one aspect of Article XI - the conditions under which it can be invoked - to be the same as those required by customary international law, and found, as a matter of fact, that Argentina failed to satisfy those conditions. No excess of powers, let alone any manifest excess of powers is involved.\n\n*Article XI is not self-judging*\n--------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal thoroughly examined Argentina\u2019s argument that Article XI is self-judging in character, and that it came to the well reasoned conclusion that this was not the case. Instead, it found that a substantive review was required. The Tribunal did not exceed its powers, and fully stated reasons for its decision.\n\n*There was no failure to state reasons*\n---------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nSempra has emphasized that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons regarding its analysis of Article XI of the BIT and considers Argentina\u2019s position on that issue inconsistent in that Argentina also considers that the Tribunal failed to apply Article XI. Sempra considers, however, that each step in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in respect of Article XI is lucid and consistent in that it clearly shows how the Tribunal concluded that39 (1) Article XI did not define or provide the legal elements and conditions necessary for its application40, (2) it was bound to look to analogous rules of customary law41, (3) the conditions for the application of state of necessity under customary law were the same as the elements for the application of the terms of Article XI due to their similarities and the lack of clarity provided by the BIT for its application42, and (4) the BIT and Article XI provide treatment that was not less than that of customary law. Therefore, there was no failure to state reasons.\n\nSempra\u2019s rejoinder on annulment, para 328\n\nAward, paras 375, 378\n\nAward, para 375\n\nAward, para 376\n\n**CONSIDERATION OF THE FOREGOING ARGUMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Application of Article XI of the BIT**\n----------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nFor reasons which will be discussed in greater detail later, the Committee finds that the Award must be annulled in its entirety on the basis of manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention) in respect of failure to apply Article XI of the BIT. The question therefore arises whether it is necessary for the Committee to deal with other arguments advanced by Argentina in relation to the way in which the Tribunal dealt with Article XI. The Committee feels that it should deal with these arguments for the sake of completeness.\n\n*Manifest error of law*\n-----------------------\n\n160.\n\nArgentina has argued that the Tribunal made \"manifest errors of law\" in respect of the way in which it dealt with Article XI. These manifest errors of law consisted in equating Article XI of the BIT with Article 25 of the ILC Articles.\n\n161.\n\nArgentina also argued that the Tribunal committed a serious error of law, by considering the application of Article 27 to a possible duty of compensation of the State before, and indeed without, reviewing whether responsibility was precluded under Article XI. Additionally, in this respect, the application of Article 27 under customary international law constituted a manifest error of law. While admitting that a \"mere error of law\" is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, Argentina affirms that such error may be serious enough to reach to the level of a manifest excess of powers for failure to apply the proper law.43\n\nAnnulment Memorial, para 426\n\n162.\n\nAs Argentina itself recognises, a serious error of law is not in itself a ground for annulment under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention. It is instead Argentina\u2019s contention that a serious error of law may, in certain circumstances, constitute a manifest excess of powers (and therefore be annullable on that ground).\n\n163.\n\nIt is correct - as also pointed out by Argentina - that certain *ad hoc* committees have dealt with this issue and opined, for instance, that incorrect application of law might constitute a manifest excess of powers if \"it amounts to effective disregard of the applicable law\".44\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81 /l) (Amco II), Decision on Annulment of 3 December 1992. Similar statements have been made by other *ad hoc* committees, *e.g.* the *MTD* Annulment Committee, which stated that annulment may be a consequence of the purported application of the relevant law, while in fact applying quite a different law (*MTD Equity Sdn Bhd. & MTD Chile S.A.* v. *Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Annulment Decision of 21 March 2007, para 47).\n\n164.\n\nAs a general proposition, this Committee would not wish totally to rule out the possibility that a manifest error of law may, in an exceptional situation, be of such egregious nature as to amount to a manifest excess of powers.\n\n165.\n\nIn this case, the Committee has reached the conclusion that the Tribunal - in respect of Article XI of the BIT - has failed altogether to apply the applicable law and, by failing to do so, has committed a manifest excess of powers. This conclusion of the Committee precludes any question of manifest error in *applying* the applicable law. It is therefore unnecessary for the Committee to engage in any more precise discussion of where that specific line should be drawn between an error of law that justifies annulment and one that does not.\n\n*Failure to state reasons*\n--------------------------\n\n*Introduction*\n--------------\n\n166.\n\nAccording to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, \"[t]he Award [\u2014] shall state the reasons upon which it is based\". The importance of this provision is highlighted by the fact that failure to state reasons constitutes a ground for annulment according to Article 52(1)(e).\n\n167.\n\nThe fact that a total absence of reasons merits annulment is clear, but such a situation is rarely, if ever, encountered in practice. Rather there will be an (alleged) absence of reasons for a particular aspect of an award, or otherwise insufficient, inadequate or possibly contradictory reasons. Difficulties arise when determining what standard should be applied in deciding whether a defect of reasoning should lead to annulment. While certainly \"frivolous, perfunctory or absurd arguments by a tribunal\"45 may well be subject to annulment, such clear-cut cases do not abound. *Ad hoc* committees are faced with making the important distinction between finding, on the one hand, reasons which are reasonably comprehensible and consistent, demonstrating, on the whole, a logical and discernable line of thinking, and, on the other hand, \"circumstances [where] there is a significant lacuna in the Award, which makes it impossible for the reader to follow the reasoning on this point\".46\n\nSchreuer, ICSID Commentary (2009), page 997 (para 344).\n\n*CMS* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, para 97.\n\n*Discussion*\n------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Committee observes that the Tribunal dealt with Argentina\u2019s defence based on necessity under Argentine law, customary international law, and Article XI of the BIT in that order. In so doing, the Tribunal followed the order in which Argentina argued these defences. It is evident that the Tribunal gave a detailed account of its reasoning in respect of necessity under customary international law. In this regard the Tribunal noted that the ILC Articles, although not constituting a source of customary law still (as was accepted by the Parties) represents a fair expression of such law, and held that the conditions laid down in Article 25 of the ILC Articles were necessary conditions for invoking an \"essential security interest\" under the BIT.47 The Tribunal dedicated considerable attention to the question whether or not Article XI is self-judging (a point also extensively argued by Argentina) and arrived at a reasoned conclusion on that point. Having reasoned so far, the Tribunal held that judicial review of the invocation of Article XI, and the measures adopted, must be a substantive one, and concerned with whether the requirements under customary law or the Treaty were met and could thereby preclude wrongfulness.48 The Tribunal reasoned that since the BIT itself did not deal with the legal elements necessary for the legitimate invocation of a state of necessity, criteria found in customary international law had to be applied. From the above overview it is clear how the Tribunal reasoned in order to reach the conclusion it did. Hence, there is no failure to state reasons.\n\nAward, para 375\n\nAward, para 388.\n\n*Did the Tribunal\u2019s rejection of the proposition that Article XI is self-judging constitute an annullable error?*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nArgentina argues that by failing to appreciate that Article XI is self-judging, the Tribunal disregarded Argentina\u2019s discretion to take measures in order to maintain public order and protect its essential security interests. Therefore, by ignoring the fact that a state invoking Article XI is the sole judge of the appropriateness of the contested measures, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n170.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, it is clear that there was no failure on the part of the Tribunal to consider the matter of whether Article XI is self-judging or not. On the contrary, it applied considerable attention to the subject (as evidently did the Parties), reaching the conclusion that Article XI is not self-judging, a conclusion that the Tribunal was perfectly entitled to reach.\n\n171.\n\nArgentina censmes the Tribunal for having \"dogmatically\" asserted what it considered to be the object and purpose of the BIT, without giving reasons and drawing its conclusions from that. Equally seriously, according to Argentina, the Tribunal reversed the logical sequence of the interpretative process by passing over the text of the relevant treaty provision itself in breach of Article 31(1) of the VCLT.\n\n172.\n\nIn addition, Argentina has argued extensively in favour of the self-judging nature of Article XI of the BIT, referring to a number of sources (expert testimony, official statements and other authorities). These arguments are, however, clearly appropriate to a review of the merits and cannot be considered by an *ad hoc* committee.\n\n*Manifest excess of powers*\n---------------------------\n\n*Introduction*\n--------------\n\n173.\n\nAs has been confirmed on numerous occasions there is a fundamental distinction between erroneous application of the law and a failure to apply the law. By way of example, the following statements by *ad hoc* committees may be mentioned. The MINE *ad hoc* committee stated:\n\n\"Disregard of the applicable rules of law must be distinguished from erroneous application of those rules which, even if manifestly unwarranted, furnishes no ground for annulment\".49\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4); Decision on Annulment of 22 December 1989, para 5.04.\n\n174.\n\nThe Amco (I) *ad hoc* committee stated:\n\nThe **ad hoc** Committee will limit itself to determining whether the Tribunal did in fact apply the law it was bound to apply to the dispute. Failure to apply such law, as distinguished from mere misconstruction of that law, would constitute a manifest excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal and a ground for nullity under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention. The **ad hoc** Committee has approached this task with caution, distinguishing failure to apply the applicable law as a ground for annulment and misinterpretation of the applicable law as a ground for appeal.50\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/71/1), Decision on Annulment of 16 May 1986 (Amco I).\n\n175.\n\nOn Argentina\u2019s case, the Tribunal failed to apply Article XI of the BIT, and, by this failure, apart from a failure to state reasons, committed a manifest excess of powers.\n\n176.\n\nIt is clear that Argentina in the present case (as well as in CMS)51 argued the plea of necessity under customary international law before proceeding to the matter of preclusion under Article XI. This sequence of argument is illogical as the question whether a state of necessity justifies exoneration from state responsibility will become an issue only where liability is not already precluded under Article XI of the BIT. As a general rule, a treaty will take precedence over customary international law.\n\nPara 132 of the *CMS* Decision on Annulment.\n\n177.\n\nOne can certainly discuss Article 25 on the assumption (implicit or explicit) that Article XI does not lead to preclusion. If it is concluded (as in this case) that a justification for wrongfulness is not available under Article 25, the Tribunal would need to go back to Article XI in order to decide whether the assumption under which the Article 25 inquiry was pmsued is valid in the circumstances. In this case, however, the Tribunal did not do that.\n\n178.\n\nArgentina has argued that the Tribunal made \"manifest errors of law\" in respect of its failure to deal with Article XI of the BIT. This manifest error of law consisted in equating Article XI of the BIT with Article 25 of the ILC Articles.\n\n179.\n\nArgentina further contends that the Tribunal committed a serious error of law by considering the application of Article 27 concerning a possible duty of compensation of the State before (or indeed without) reviewing whether responsibility was precluded under Article XI of the BIT. Additionally, in this respect, the application of Article 27 under customary international law constituted a manifest error of law. While admitting that a \"mere error of law\" is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1) of the Convention, Argentina affirms that such error may be serious enough to reach to the level of a manifest excess of powers for failure to apply the proper law.52\n\nAnnulment Memorial, para 426\n\n*The admissibility of Argentina\u2019s arguments*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nIn argument before the Committee, Sempra contended that certain of the arguments advanced by Argentina on the first issue were new, in the sense that they had not been advanced before the Tribunal, which had not had an opportunity to consider them. They were therefore inadmissible in these annulment proceedings.\n\n181.\n\nSempra claims that Argentina presented53 only two arguments concerning (1) the self-judging nature of Article XI, and (2) that the defence of necessity precluded liability and compensation. Further, Argentina did not differentiate between the state of necessity under customary international law, on the one hand, and preclusion under Article XI, on the other.\n\nSempra\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para 373\n\n182.\n\nAt paragraph 366, having quoted the terms of Article XI, the Tribunal sets out the arguments of Argentina as follows:\n\n366. The Respondent, relying on the opinion of Dean Slaughter and Professor Burke-White, asserts that public order and national security exceptions have to be interpreted broadly in the context of this Article so as to include considerations of economic security and political stability. Moreover, the Respondent\u2019s experts understand this Article to be self-judging insofar as each party will be the sole judge of when the situation requires measures of the kind envisaged by the Article, subject only to a determination of good faith by tribunals that might be called upon to settle a dispute on this point [Footnote omitted] In the Respondent's view. the gravity of the crisis that it faced amply justified resorting to such measures, which can only be considered as having been adopted in good faith.\n\n183.\n\nArgentina thus raised two issues. The first concerned the scope and application of Article XI. The second concerned the question whether Article XI is self-judging. The first issue is logically prior to the second.\n\n184.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee finds that, in so far as the arguments of Argentina can be said to be \"new\", they are a permissible development of Argentina\u2019s arguments on the first issue identified above and are therefore admissible.54\n\nIt may be noted that the matter of Article XI was dealt with by Argentina in its Counter-Memorial in the arbitration (AR39), Section XI in paras 647 - 659 (particularly in paragraph 654). In its Rejoinder (AR50), Argentina set out its defence under Article XI and distinguished it from the doctrine of necessity under customary international law (paras 432 - 635, *e.g.* para 633), affirming its position that invoking the above-mentioned article should not be confused with invocation of the state of necessity by explaining that \"[t]hey do not constitute a defence as the state of necessity but an invocation of the provisions of the applicable BITs\". This distinction is also addressed by paras 376 - 377 of the Award. From the above considerations it is clear - contrary to Sempra\u2019s allegations - that Argentina distinguished the application of Article XI of the BIT from the plea of necessity under customary international law.\n\n*The Tribunal\u2019s findings*\n-------------------------\n\n185.\n\nAfter setting out in greater detail the arguments of Argentina and of Sempra, the Tribunal proceeded to set out its own assessment of the arguments (reproduced here for ease of reference):\n\n373. In weighing this discussion, the Tribunal must first note that the object and purpose of the Treaty is, as a general proposition, for it to be applicable in situations of economic difficulty and hardship that require the protection of the internationally guaranteed rights of its beneficiaries. To this extent, any interpretation resulting in an escape route from the defined obligations cannot be easily reconciled with that object and purpose. Accordingly, a restrictive interpretation of any such alternative is mandatory.\n\n374. The Tribunal considers that there is nothing that would prevent an interpretation allowing for the inclusion of economic emergency in the context of Article XI. Essential security interests can eventually encompass situations other than the traditional military threats for which the institution found its origins in customary law. However, to conclude that such a determination is self-judging would definitely be inconsistent with the object and purpose noted. In fact, the Treaty would be deprived of any substantive meaning.\n\n375. In addition, in view of the fact that the Treaty does not define what is to be understood by an \"essential security interest,\" the requirements for a state of necessity under customary international law, as outlined above in connection with their expression in Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, become relevant to the matter of establishing whether the necessary conditions have been met for its invocation under the Treaty. Different might have been the case if the Treaty had defined this concept and the conditions for its exercise, but this was not the case.\n\n376. The Tribunal notes that in the view of Dean Slaughter and Professor Burke-White, which the Respondent shares, the *CMS* award was mistaken in that it discussed Article XI in connection with necessity under customary law. This Tribunal believes, however, that the Treaty provision is inseparable from the customary law standard insofar as the definition of necessity and the conditions for its operation are concerned, given that it is under customary law that such elements have been defined. Similarly, the Treaty does not contain a definition concerning either the maintenance of international peace and security, or the conditions for its operation. Reference is instead made to the Charter of the United Nations in Article 6 of the Protocol to the Treaty.\n\n377. The expert opinion of Dean Slaughter and Professor Burke-White expresses the view that the treaty regime is different and separate from customary law as it is *lex specialis.* As Professor Burke-White explained at the hearing, the consequence of this approach is that while Article XI requires only a good faith determination, under customary law the whole panoply of requirements laid down in Article 25 of the Articles comes into play. Moreover, Professor Burke-White stated that the U.S. and Argentina had \"decided to accord investors greater protection than they would receive under customary international law, but simultaneously to guarantee to states, the States Parties greater protection to deal with threats to their national security.\"\n\n378. It is no doubt correct to conclude that a treaty regime specifically dealing with a given matter will prevail over more general rules of customary law. The problem here, however, is that the Treaty itself did not deal with the legal elements necessary for the legitimate invocation of a state of necessity. The rule governing such questions will thus be found under customary law. As concluded above, such requirements and conditions have not been fully met in this case. Moreover, the view of the Respondent\u2019s legal expert, as expressed at the hearing, contradicts the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Treaty standards are not more favorable than those of customary law, and at the most should be equated with the international minimum standard. The Tribunal does not believe that the intention of the parties can be described in the terms which the expert has used, as there is no indication that such was the case. Nor does the Tribunal believe that because Article XI did not make an express reference to customary law, this source of rights and obligations becomes inapplicable. International law is not a fragmented body of law as far as basic principles are concerned and necessity is no doubt one such basic principle.\n\n379. As explained by Dean Slaughter, the U.S. position has been gradually evolving towards support for self-judging clauses in respect of national security interests, and some bilateral investment treaties reflect this change, albeit not all of them. Yet, this does not necessarily result in the conclusion that such was the intention of the parties in respect of the Treaty under consideration. Truly exceptional and extraordinary clauses, such as a self-judging provision, must be expressly drafted to reflect that intent, as otherwise there can well be a presumption that they do not have such meaning in view of their exceptional nature.\n\n380. In the case of the Treaty, nothing was said in respect of a self-judging character, and the elements invoked in support of this view originate for the most part in U.S. Congressional discussions concerning broader issues, or in indirect interpretations arising mainly with respect to the eventual application of model investment treaties used by the U.S. The Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief has listed a number of discussions and statements which relate to the issue of a self-judging interpretation, but these items are contextual and do not specifically address the case of the Treaty in question.\n\n381. Professor Burke-White also stated at the hearing that, in his understanding, the letter submitting the Treaty to the Argentine Congress did not say \"anything about it being self-judging, nor anything about it being non-self-judging... this document does not speak to that issue.\" This expert also explained that while he had no evidence about the internal discussions within the Argentine Government as to the intent of the Treaty, there was such evidence in respect of the intent of the U.S. Government, and that given the \"reciprocal nature of the Treaty... the intent... would be for a self-judging interpretation of Article XI.\" This is, however, again a contextual interpretation that does not appear to meet the stricter requirements of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties in respect of treaty interpretation in the light of its context, or the resort to supplementary means of interpretation.\n\n382. More to the point is a letter sent by an official of the United States Department of State on 15 September 2006 to a former official asked to testify in the context of a different arbitration, which the Respondent brought to the attention of the Tribunal on June 25, 2007. In this letter, it is stated that \"notwithstanding the decision of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case, the position of the U. S. Government is that the essential security language in om FCN treaties and Bilateral Investment Treaties is self-judging, *i.e.,* only the party itself is competent to determine what is in its own essential security interests.\"\n\nThe Respondent is of the view that this confirms the interpretation given by it of the Treaty in this case. The Claimant, however, has opposed this understanding on the argument that the letter refers to an interpretation supposedly adopted as from 2006 and that in any event it does not refer to the Treaty with Argentina nor does it preclude liability or compensation.\n\n383. The discussion noted above concerning the GATT and the Nicaragua decision, just like the *Oil Platforms* case, confirms that the language of a provision has to be very precise for it to lead to a conclusion about its self-judging nature. In those decisions, the fact that the language was not express turned out to be crucial to the rejection of arguments favoring a self-judging interpretation. So too, the International Court of Justice held in the *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* case, when referring to the conditions defined by the International Law Commission, that \"the State concerned is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met.\"\n\n384. The Tribunal must also note that not even in the context of GATT Article XXI is the issue considered to be settled in favor of a self-judging interpretation, and the very fact that such article has not been excluded from dispute settlement is indicative of its non-self-judging nature.\n\n385. The same holds true of the U. S. Department of State letter referred to above in that it does not address any specific treaty, least that with Argentina. Furthermore, the fact that arbitration is the compulsory dispute settlement mechanism established in the Treaty in question, like with GATT/WTO, could be rather indicative of the non-self-judging nature of the essential security interest clause. Not even if this is the interpretation given to the clause today by the United States would this necessarily mean that such an interpretation governs the Treaty. The view of one State does not make international law, even less so when such a view is ascertained only by indirect means of interpretation or in a rather remote or general way as far as the very Treaty at issue is concerned. What is relevant is the intention which both parties had in signing the Treaty, and this does not confirm the self-judging interpretation.\n\n386. Moreover, even if this interpretation were shared today by both parties to the Treaty, it still would not result in a change of its terms. States are of course free to amend the Treaty by consenting to another text, but this would not affect rights acquired under the Treaty by investors or other beneficiaries. In fact, Article XIV of the Treaty provides that in case of termination, the investment will continue to be protected under its provisions \"for a further period of ten years.\" So too, with reference to rights protected under the Energy Charter Treaty, the tribunal in *Plama* has held that any denial of advantages to which an investor might have rights \"should not have retrospective effect,\" as such a situation would result in making legitimate expectations false at a much later date.\n\n387. As an English court has recently held in respect of a claim of non-justiciability relating to a State challenge to the *OEPC* award, the fact that a treaty is concluded between States cannot allow the derogation of rights that belong to private parties. In that case, the issue concerned dispute settlement, and as a consequence the doctrine of non-justiciability was held not to apply.\n\n388. In the light of this discussion, the Tribunal concludes that Article XI is not self-judging and that judicial review is not limited in its respect to an examination of whether its invocation, or the measures adopted, were taken in good faith. The judicial control must be a substantive one, and concerned with whether the requirements under customary law or the Treaty have been met and can thereby preclude wrongfulness. Since the Tribunal has found above that the crisis invoked does not meet the customary law requirements of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, it concludes that necessity or emergency is not conducive in this case to the preclusion of wrongfulness, and that there is no need to undertake a further judicial review under Article XI given that this Article does not set out conditions different from customary law in such regard.\n\n389. A judicial determination as to compliance with the requirements of international law in this matter should not be understood as suggesting that arbitral tribunals wish to substitute their views for the functions of sovereign States. Such a ruling instead simply responds to the Tribunal\u2019s duty that, in applying international law, it cannot fail to give effect to legal commitments that are binding on the parties, and must interpret the rules accordingly unless a derogation of those commitments has been expressly agreed to.\n\n390. The Tribunal explained above that it would consider the requirement of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, to the effect that the act in question not seriously impair an essential interest of the State towards which the obligation exists in the context of the Treaty obligations. In the light of the discussion above about changing interpretations, it does not appear that the Government\u2019s invocation of Article XI or of a state of necessity generally would be taken by the other party to mean that such impairment arises.\n\n391. Be that as it may, in the context of investment treaties there is still the need to take into consideration the interests of the private entities who are the ultimate beneficiaries of those obligations, as was explained by the English court in the *OEPC* case noted above. The essential interest of the Claimant would certainly be seriously impaired by the operation of Article XI or a state of necessity in this case.\n\n**DISCUSSION**\n--------------\n\n186.\n\nInvestment arbitration under the ICSID regime (or any other type of arbitration whether institutional or *ad hoc)* is subject to the consent of the Parties. The State\u2019s consent to arbitration of investment disputes is given, in a very large number of cases, in a treaty, while the investor\u2019s consent is normally included in its request for arbitration. The scope, extent and conditions that apply to the procedural means of recourse and substantive protections offered to the investor are exclusively addressed by the treaty.\n\n187.\n\nWhere the treaty permits or excuses conduct adverse to the investor in specific circumstances enunciated in the treaty, it follows that the terms of the treaty itself exclude the protection to the investor that the treaty would otherwise have provided.\n\n188.\n\nAccording to Article 31(1) of VCLT, the first point of reference for interpretation of a BIT provision is the \"ordinary meaning\" of the words of the treaty themselves.\n\n189.\n\nIn the present case, where the BIT provides the relevant treaty language, it is necessary first and foremost to apply the provisions of the BIT. Indeed, the Parties are in agreement that the BIT constitutes the applicable law.\n\n190.\n\nArticle 38 of the Statute of the ICJ lists \"international conventions\" as a primary source of international law. However, it is not primarily for this reason that the BIT has pre-eminence in the investor-state context of arbitration, but because the consent to submit to international dispute resolution is predicated on the very terms of the BIT.\n\n191.\n\nAgainst that background, it is necessary to consider the relevant terms of the BIT and the way in which the Tribunal approached its application.\n\n192.\n\nArticle XI of the BIT provides as follows:\n\nThis Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the [p]rotection of its own essential interests.\n\n193.\n\nArticle XI does not specify who is to be the judge of whether the measures taken are \"necessary\" for one or more of the purposes specified - in other words, whether the State Party taking the measures is itself to be the judge of their necessity, in which event the provision is said to be \"self-judging\".\n\n194.\n\nThe Committee finds that the reasoning of the Tribunal does not distinguish clearly between the question whether Article XI is self-judging and the prior question as to its scope and application. Thus, at the outset in paragraph 374 of the Award, the Tribunal states that \"there is nothing that would prevent an interpretation allowing for the inclusion of economic emergency in the context of Article XI\" and that \"essential security interests can eventually encompass situations other than the traditional military threats for which the institution found its origins in customary law\". The Tribunal then goes on directly to say, \"However, to conclude that such a determination is self-judging would definitely be inconsistent with the object and purpose noted. In fact, the Treaty would be deprived of any substantive meaning\".\n\n195.\n\nAs regards the scope and application of Article XI, the Committee finds the following passages to be central to the reasoning of the Tribunal:-\n\n(1) in paragraph 376: \"This Tribunal believes... that the Treaty provision *[i.e.* Article XI of the BIT] is inseparable from the customary law standard insofar as the definition of necessity and the conditions for its operation are concerned, given that it is under customary law that such elements have been defined.\"\n\n(2) in paragraph 378: \"It is no doubt correct to conclude that a treaty regime specifically dealing with a given matter will prevail over more general rules of customary law. The problem here, however, is that the Treaty itself did not deal with the legal elements necessary for the legitimate invocation of a state of necessity. The rule governing such questions will thus be found under customary law. As concluded above, such requirements and conditions have not been fully met in this case.... Nor does the Tribunal believe that because Article XI did not make an express reference to customary law, this source of rights and obligations becomes inapplicable. International law is not a fragmented body of law as far as basic principles are concerned and necessity is no doubt one such basic principle.\"\n\n(3) in paragraph 388: \"In the light of this discussion, the Tribunal concludes that Article XI is not self-judging and that judicial review is not limited in its respect to an examination of whether its invocation, or the measures adopted, were taken in good faith. The judicial control must be a substantive one, and concerned with whether the requirements under customary law or the Treaty have been met and can thereby preclude wrongfulness. Since the Tribunal has found above that the crisis invoked does not meet the customary law requirements of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, it concludes that necessity or emergency is not conducive in this case to the preclusion of wrongfulness, and that there is no need to undertake a further judicial review under Article XI given that this Article does not set out conditions different from customary law in such regard.\"\n\n196.\n\nIn the opinion of the Committee, the reasoning of these passages compels the conclusion that the Tribunal did not deem itself to be required - or even entitled - to consider the applicability of Article XI, both because this provision did not deal with the legal elements necessary for the legitimate invocation of a state of necessity and because the Tribunal found that the Argentine economic crisis did not meet the customary international law requirements as set out in Article 25 of the ILC Articles.\n\n197.\n\nFirst, as regards paragraph 376, the Committee accepts, of course, that it may be appropriate to look to customary law as a guide to the interpretation of terms used in the BIT. It does not follow, however, that customary law *(in casu,* Article 25 of the ILC Articles) establishes a peremptory \"definition of necessity and the conditions for its operation\". While some norms of customary law are peremptory *(jus cogens'),* others are not, and States may contract otherwise, as the Tribunal itself recognises in paragraph 378.\n\n198.\n\nSecond, Article XI differs in material respects from Article 25, as can be seen from the following comparison of the texts:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Article XI of the BIT** | **Article 25 of the ILC Articles** |\n| This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests. | 1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act: (a) Is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and (b) Does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole. 2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if: (a) The international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or (b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity. |\n\n199.\n\nIt is apparent from this comparison that Article 25 does not offer a guide to *interpretation* of the terms used in Article XI. The most that can be said is that certain words or expressions are the same or similar.\n\n200.\n\nMore importantly, Article 25 is concerned with the invocation by a State Party of necessity \"as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State\". Article 25 presupposes that an act has been committed that is incompatible with the State\u2019s international obligations and is therefore \"wrongful\". Article XI, on the other hand, provides that \"This Treaty shall not preclude\" certain measures so that, where Article XI applies, the taking of such measures is not incompatible with the State\u2019s international obligations and is not therefore \"wrongful\". Article 25 and Article XI therefore deal with quite different situations. Article 25 cannot therefore be assumed to \"define necessity and the conditions for its operation\" for the purpose of interpreting Article XI, still less to do so as a mandatory norm of international law.\n\n201.\n\nThird, as regards paragraph 378, it is unclear what the Tribunal means by the statement that \"the Treaty itself *[i.e.* the BIT] did not deal with the legal elements necessary for the *legitimate* invocation of a state of necessity. The *rule* governing such questions will *thus* be found under customary law\" (emphasis added). Invocation of a state of necessity under the terms of a bilateral treaty need not necessarily be \"legitimated\" by a \"rule\" of international law. There may be no rule governing such questions. Still less is it obvious that the rule is to be found in a provision of customary law dealing with invocation of necessity as a justification for breach of an international obligation.\n\n202.\n\nFourth, again as regards paragraph 378, even if it be the case that \"international law is not a fragmented body of law as far as basic principles are concerned\", it does not follow either: (i) that \"necessity is *no doubt* one such basic principle\" in the sense that it must be interpreted and applied in exactly the same way in all circumstances, or (ii) that international law will become \"fragmented\" if States contract otherwise. While there may be certain norms of international law, including customary law, which would render it unlawful under international law for States to agree to adopt a provision inconsistent with those norms, this is not such a case. *Jus cogens* does not require parties to a bilateral investment treaty to forego the possibility of invoking a defence of necessity in whatever terms they may agree. The terms on which they agree may be thought to be politically or economically unwise, but this does not render them unlawful.\n\n203.\n\nFifth, as regards paragraph 388, for the same reasons, the statement that \"judicial control must be... concerned with whether the requirements under customary law or the Treaty have been met and can thereby preclude wrongfulness\" begs the question. The prior question is whether there is wrongfulness. As noted above, Article 25 deals with a situation where a State Party is in breach of a Treaty obligation and seeks to justify its breach by a plea of necessity. Article 25 sets out the restrictive conditions in which such a plea may be admitted. Article XI of the BIT, on the other hand, expressly provides that the BIT \"shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary\" for certain reasons or purposes.\n\n204.\n\nIt is true that the BIT does not prescribe who is to determine whether the measures in question are or were \"necessary\" for the purpose so invoked - whether, in other words, Article XI is or is not self-judging.\n\nBut if the measures in question are properly judged to be \"necessary\", then there is no breach of any Treaty obligation. In that event, it is not the case that \"judicial control must be... concerned with whether the requirements under customary law or the Treaty have been met and can thereby preclude wrongfulness\".\n\n205.\n\nSo the question arises whether the error in law so identified constitutes an excess of powers. Excess of powers is normally invoked where it is claimed that the Tribunal has failed to apply the applicable law, and a line of decisions in ICSID practice confirms that failure to apply the applicable law may amount to an excess of powers, whereas erroneous application of the law does not constitute a basis for annulment.55\n\nSee above, paras 173-174\n\n206.\n\nIt will therefore be necessary to determine whether the error in question amounts (i) to a failure to apply the law, in which event the award of the Tribunal may be annulled, or (ii) to a misapplication of the law, in which event the award, although to that extent defective, will not be annulled.\n\n207.\n\nIn this case, the Committee finds that the following sentence in paragraph 388 of the Award demonstrates that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law:\n\nSince the Tribunal has found above that the crisis invoked does not meet the customary law requirements of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, it concludes that necessity or emergency is not conducive in this case to the preclusion of wrongfulness, and that there is no need to undertake a further judicial review under Article XI given that this Article does not set out conditions different from customary law in such regard.\n\n208.\n\nThe Tribunal has held, in effect, that the substantive criteria of Article XI simply cannot find application where rules of customary international law - as enunciated in the ILC Articles - do not lead to exoneration in case of wrongfulness, and that Article 25 \"trumps\" Article XI in providing the mandatory legal norm to be applied. Thus, the Tribunal adopted Article 25 of the ILC Articles as the primary law to be applied, rather than Article XI of the BIT, and in so doing made a fundamental error in identifying and applying the applicable law.\n\n209.\n\nThe Committee is therefore driven to the conclusion that the Tribunal has failed to conduct its review on the basis that the applicable legal norm is to be found in Article XI of the BIT, and that this failure constitutes an excess of powers within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.\n\n210.\n\nIt remains to be considered whether the excess of powers so found is \"manifest\".\n\n*The excess of powers must be \"manifest\"*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nIn order for excess of powers to require annulment of an Award, the excess must be \"manifest\". In order to ensure that this qualification is satisfied, it should be noted, as a first step, that it is necessary to observe the basic requirement of the VCLT to seek the \"ordinary meaning\" of the relevant term. In a literal sense \"manifest\" is something which is \"plain\", \"clear\", \"obvious\", \"evident\" *i.e.* easily understood or recognized by the mind.56\n\nSchreuer, ICSID Commentary (2009), page 938 (para 135)\n\n212.\n\nIt would appear that *ad hoc* committees have applied either a two step approach determining first whether there is an excess of powers and, if so, whether that excess was manifest, or an approach starting from a *prima facie* assessment of the presence of any manifest excess and, if the finding is negative, stop the examination there. The Committee favours the two-step approach, as excess of powers is a *sine qua non* for the need to gauge the manifestness of the excess, and allows a more cogent analysis of what constitutes a breach, on one hand, and, on the other, what makes it manifest.\n\n213.\n\nWhether an excess of power satisfies the qualitative criterion of being manifest has been the object of scrutiny in a large number of decisions. All of these decisions have, in different language, expressed the opinion that in order for an excess of powers to be manifest, it must be quite evident without the need to engage in an elaborate analysis of the text of the Award.57\n\nThe following examples of *ad hoc* committees which have grappled with the concept of the qualifying criterion of \"manifest\" in the context of a manifest excess of powers may be recalled in this relation.  \n \"The ad hoc Committee considers that the term \"manifest\" is a strong and emphatic term referring to obviousness. In its dictionary meaning, \"manifest\" is substantially equivalent to \"clear\", \"plain\", \"obvious\", \"evident\":  \n \"what is clear can be seen readily;  \n what is obvious lies directly in our way, and necessarily arrests our attention; what is evident so clearly as to remove doubt;  \n what is manifest is very distinctly evident\" *(**Soufraki v. UAE,* para 39).  \n \"The excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. When the latter happens, the excess of power is no longer manifest.\" (*Wena Etotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2002, para 25).  \n \"... even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal\u2019s conduct, if susceptible of argument \u2018one way or the other\u2019, is not manifest\" *(**CDC Group pic v.* *Republic of Seychelles* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14), Decision on Annulment, 29 June 2005, para 41).\n\n214.\n\nFor reasons dealt with above, the Committee has concluded that the Tribunal engaged in an excess of powers by its total failure to apply Article XI of the BIT.\n\n215.\n\nProceeding to the qualitative criterion of \"manifest\", the Committee takes the following considerations into account.\n\n216.\n\nIn paragraph 378 of the Award, the Tribunal opines that because the BIT did not deal with the legal elements necessary for the legitimate invocation of a state of necessity, the rule governing such questions will thus be found under customary law. This implies that, according to the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, where the rules of customary law do not legitimate treaty application, the treaty provision cannot be applied.\n\nThis conclusion is reinforced by the following sentence in the Award, which explains that \"such requirements and conditions have not been fully met in this case\".\n\n217.\n\nIn other words, the fact that customary international law, as enunciated by the ILC Articles, does not confer exoneration from wrongfulness was held by the Tribunal to imply that it need not take the inquiry any further. This is further confirmed in the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that for the reasons just mentioned \"there is no need to undertake a further judicial review under Article XI\".58\n\nAward, para 388\n\n218.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Committee considers that it is obvious from a simple reading of the reasons of the Tribunal that it did not identify or apply Article XI of the BIT as the applicable law, and that it failed to do so on the assumption that the language of this provision was somehow not legitimated by the dictates of customary international law.\n\n219.\n\nThe excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal is therefore manifest.\n\n*Articles 11(2) (a) and X of the BIT*\n-------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Committee wishes to address the argument of Sempra relating to Articles II(2)(a) and X of the BIT. Sempra relies on these provisions of the BIT in support of the proposition that the BIT cannot be seen as other than an integral part of the international law regime, the Committee wishes to make the following observations.\n\n221.\n\nThere is nothing in the materials, and particularly not in the Award, that indicates that the significance, if any, of Articles II (MFN Treatment and a national treatment) and Article X (non-derogation) have been argued by the Parties or discussed by the Tribunal in the context of the arbitral proceedings. This is, however, not determinative of the issue.\n\nIn the present annulment proceeding, the Committee has no reason to discuss whether these provisions could have had a role to play in the application of Article XI (since this provision of the BIT, according to the Committee\u2019s finding, was not applied at all). For that reason, Articles II and X simply do not enter into the considerations that the *ad hoc* Committee needs to take into account in order to reach this conclusion. The reason for annulment is that Article XI was not applied, not that it was applied in any particular way, whether affected or not by the Articles II and X of the BIT.\n\n*Exercise of a discretionary right to annul?*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe effect of the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of necessity as a matter solely of customary international law is that Argentina has effectively been deprived of its procedmally assured entitlement to have its right of preclusion laid down in Article XI of the BIT - the applicable law in this respect - subjected to legal scrutiny. For this reason, as annulment may be a matter of discretion, the Committee has concluded that, in this case, the Award must be annulled.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n--------------\n\n223.\n\nSummarising the Committee\u2019s discussion above, it arrives at the conclusion that the Award of 28 September 2007 in ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16 shall be annulled on the ground of manifest excess of powers.\n\n**COSTS**\n---------\n\n224.\n\nAccording to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, a Tribunal shall (absent party agreement) decide how and by whom fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges and fees of the Centre shall be paid, such decision forming part of the Award. Article 52(4) extends the application of this provision to annulment proceedings.\n\n225.\n\nNeither the Convention nor its Rules and Regulations give any guidelines as to the application of this provision. The principal alternatives are (1) the application of the rule that the costs follow the event (\"loser pays\") or (2) equal sharing of costs.\n\n226.\n\nIt is fair to say that a majority of *ad hoc* committees have opted for the latter principle, although a recent tendency towards the former principle may be noted.\n\n227.\n\nThis *ad hoc* Committee considers that it is in line with equitable principles to let the rule that the costs-follow-the-event apply to those costs of the annulment proceeding that have been incurred by the Centre, *i.e.* in respect of the fees and expenses of the members of the *ad hoc* Committee and the charges, fees, and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Centre.\n\n228.\n\nFor this reason, Sempra shall be ordered to reimburse Argentina the total amount of the costs of the Centre - as finally determined - to the extent that these have been advanced by Argentina, with each Party bearing the expenses for its own representation and its related party costs.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n229.\n\nIn consideration of the foregoing, the Committee unanimously decides to:\n\nAnnul the Award of 28 September 2007 on the ground of manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention) owing to the failure of the Arbitral Tribunal to apply Article XI of the BIT between the United States and the Argentine Republic concerning Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment of 14 November 1991: such annulment applies necessarily to the Award in its entirety, pursuant to Article 52(3) of the Convention.\n\nOrder Sempra to reimburse to the Argentine Republic all of the expenses incurred by the Centre in connection with the Annulment proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrators."}]}
