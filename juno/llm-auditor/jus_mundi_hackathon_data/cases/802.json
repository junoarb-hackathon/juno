The Claimant by document dated 6 August 1999, requests the Tribunal to dismiss such application.\n\n2.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent has requested the Tribunal to require the Claimant to post a guaranty, bond or similar instrument in the amount of the costs expected to be incurred by the Respondent in defending against this action.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the claim is worthless and the Claimant's accusations groundless. Accordingly, the Respondent argues, the Claimant will lose this action and should, therefore, be required to reimburse the Respondent for all its costs and expenses incurred in defending against this claim.\n\n4.\n\nProvisional measures have been ordered by previous ICSID tribunals [See for example, *Holiday Inns et al.* v. *Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1), and *MINE* v. *Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4).] However, the Tribunal has not found any ICSID case where provisional measures were ordered requiring the posting of a guaranty or bond to cover the costs and expenses to be incurred in the future by one of the parties.\n\n5.\n\nOf course, the lack of precedent is not necessarily determinative of our competence to order provisional measures in a case where such measures fall within the purview of the Arbitration Rules and are required under the circumstances.\n\n6.\n\nThe issue of provisional measures is covered by both the *Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States* and the *Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings* [Arbitration Rules.]\n\n7.\n\nArticle 47 of the Convention states;\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective interests of either party.\n\nWhile Rule 39(1) states that\n\nAt any time during the proceedings a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n8.\n\nThus, it is clear that an arbitral tribunal has the authority to recommend provisional measures.1\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the parties did not reserve the right to access national judicial or other authorities for the imposition of provisional remedies as required under Rule 39(5). Accordingly, they have relinquished this right.\n\n9.\n\nWhile there is a semantic difference between the word 'recommend' as used in Rule 39 and the word 'order' as used elsewhere in the Rules to describe the Tribunal's ability to require a party to take a certain action, the difference is more apparent than real. It should be noted that the Spanish text of that Rule uses also the word \"dictaci\u00f3n\". The Tribunal does not believe that the parties to the Convention meant to create a substantial difference in the effect of these two words. The Tribunal's authority to rule on provisional measures is no less binding than that of a final award. Accordingly, for the purposes of this Order, the Tribunal deems the word 'recommend' to be of equivalent value as the word 'order.'\n\n10.\n\nThe imposition of provisional measures is an extraordinary measure which should not be granted lightly by the Arbitral Tribunal. There is no doubt that the applicant, in this case the Respondent, has the burden to demonstrate why the Tribunal should grant its application.\n\n11.\n\nWe now turn to the Arbitration Rules and the language of the Convention to determine whether the provisional measures sought by the Respondent are capable of being ordered by the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nRule 39(1) specifies that a party may request\n\n... provisional measures for the preservation of its rights....'\n\n13.\n\nThe use of the present tense implies that such rights must exist at the time of the request, must not be hypothetical, nor are ones to be created in the future.\n\n14.\n\nAn example of an existing right would be an interest in a piece of property, the ownership of which is in dispute. A provisional measure could be ordered to require that the property not be sold or alienated before the final award of the arbitral tribunal. Such an order would preserve the *status quo* of the property, thus preserving the rights of the party in the property.\n\n15.\n\nHowever, in the instant case, we are unable to see what present rights are intended to be preserved. The Respondent alleges that it may be difficult or impossible for it to obtain reimbursement of its legal costs and expenses, *if the Claimant does not prevail and if the Tribunal orders the payment of additional costs and expenses to be paid by the Claimant*.\n\n16.\n\nThis claim contains several hypothetical situations.\n\n17.\n\nOne, whether the Respondent will prevail and two, whether the Tribunal will deem the Claimant's case to be of such nature as to require it to pay the Respondent the costs and expenses it will incur.\n\n18.\n\nObviously, at this point in the proceedings the Tribunal is unable to answer either of these two questions. These must remain, at least for the time being, as hypothetical issues concerning future events. While hypothetical issues are stimulating and academically challenging, they are beyond the ken of an arbitral tribunal determining real issues of fact and law.\n\n19.\n\nRespondent alleges that the Claimant's claim is totally without merit, forcing the Respondent to spend unnecessary money on the costs and expenses incurred in defending against the Claimant's claim.\n\n20.\n\nExpectations of success or failure in an arbitration or judicial case are conjectures. Until this Arbitral Tribunal hands down an award, no one can state with any certainty what its outcome will be. The meritoriousness of the Claimant's case will be decided by the Tribunal based on the law and the evidence presented to it.\n\n21.\n\nA determination at this time which may cast a shadow on either party's ability to present its case is not acceptable. It would be improper for the Tribunal to pre-judge the Claimant's case by recommending provisional measures of this nature.\n\n22.\n\nWe now turn to the final question before the Tribunal on this issue of provisional measures.\n\n23.\n\nAny preliminary measure to be ordered by an ICSID arbitral tribunal must relate to the subject matter of the case before the tribunal and not to separate, unrelated issues or extraneous matters.\n\n24.\n\nIn this case, the subject matter in dispute relates to an investment in Spain by an Argentine investor while the request for provisional measures relates to a guarantee or bond to ensure payment of additional costs and expenses should the Claimant not prevail in the case.\n\n25.\n\nIt is clear that these are two separate issues. The issue of provisional measures is unrelated to the facts of the dispute before the Tribunal.\n\n26.\n\nIn this case, after review of the Respondent's and Claimant's briefs, the oral arguments, as well as our review of the applicable law, we find that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that the imposition of an order for provisional measures is warranted.\n\n27.\n\nAccordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal hereby ORDERS the Respondent's application for provisional measures DISMISSED."}, {"Title": "Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2000-01-25T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Procedure**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 18, 1997, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) received from Mr. Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini, a national of the Argentine Republic (Argentina), a Request for Arbitration against the Kingdom of Spain (Spain). The request concerns a dispute arising from treatment allegedly received by Mr. Maffezini from Spanish entities, in connection with his investment in an enterprise for the production and distribution of chemical products in the Spanish region of Galicia. In his request the Claimant invokes the provisions of the 1991 \"Agreement for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Argentine Republic\" (the Argentine-Spain Bilateral Investment Treaty or BIT).1 The request also invokes, by way of a most-favored-nation (MFN) clause in the Argentine-Spain BIT, the provisions of a 1991 bilateral investment treaty between the Republic of Chile (Chile) and Spain.2\n\nAgreement between Argentina and Spain of October 3, 1991. Hereinafter cited as the Argentine-Spain BIT.\n\nAgreement between Chile and Spain of October 2, 1991. Hereinafter cited as the ChileSpain BIT.\n\n2.\n\nOn August 8, 1997, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), acknowledged receipt of the request and on the same day transmitted a copy to the Kingdom of Spain and to the Spanish Embassy in Washington, D.C. At the same time, the Centre asked Mr. Maffezini to provide (i) specific information concerning the issues in dispute and the character of the underlying investment; (ii) information as to the complete terms of Spain's consent to submit the dispute to arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the ICSID Convention); (iii) information as to the basis of his claim that the MFN clause in the Argentine-Spain BIT would allow him to invoke Spain's consent contained in the Chile-Spain BIT; and (iv) documentation concerning the entry into force of the bilateral investment treaties invoked in the request. Mr. Maffezini provided this information in two letters of September 10 and September 29, 1997.\n\n3.\n\nOn October 30, 1997, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On this same date, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the request and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n4.\n\nOn December 22, 1997, the Claimant proposed to the Respondent that the Arbitral Tribunal consist of a sole arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the parties. The Claimant further proposed that, if the parties fail to agree in the name of the sole arbitrator by January 31, 1998, the sole arbitrator shall be appointed by ICSID's Secretary-General.\n\n5.\n\nOn March 5, 1998, Spain having failed to respond to the Claimant's proposal and more that 60 days having elapsed since the registration of the request, the Claimant informed the Secretary-General that he was choosing the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal, therefore, would consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by Mr. Maffezini, one appointed by Spain, and the third, presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n6.\n\nOn March 18, 1998, the Centre received a communication from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Finance, whereby Spain anticipated having objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and to the competence of the Tribunal, providing the Centre with a summary of the grounds on which such objections were based. The Centre promptly informed the Respondent that a copy of this communication, as well as copies of the request for arbitration and its accompanying documentation, of the notice of registration and of the correspondence exchanged between the parties and the Centre would be transmitted, in due course, to each of the Members of the Tribunal, noting that the question of jurisdiction was one for the Tribunal to decide.\n\n7.\n\nOn April 24, 1998, Mr. Maffezini appointed Professor Thomas Buergenthal, a national of the United States of America, as an arbitrator. On May 4, 1998, Spain appointed Mr. Maurice Wolf, also a national of the United States of America, as an arbitrator. The parties, however, failed to agree on the appointment of the third, presiding, arbitrator. In these circumstances, by means of a further communication of May 14, 1998, the Claimant requested that the third, presiding, arbitrator in the proceeding be appointed by the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.3\n\nUnder Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, if the Tribunal is not yet constituted within 90 days after the notice of registration of the request has been dispatched, the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council shall, at the request of either party, and after consulting both parties as far as possible, appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed and designate an arbitrator to be the President of the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nHaving consulted with the parties, the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council appointed Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a Chilean national, as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal. On June 24, 1998, ICSID's Legal Adviser, on behalf of the Centre's Secretary-General, and in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nOn July 3, 1998, the Respondent filed an application for provisional measures, requiring the Claimant to post a guaranty in the amount of the costs expected to be incurred by Spain in defending against this action. By further filing of August 7, 1998, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to dismiss such application.\n\n10.\n\nAfter consulting with the parties, the Tribunal scheduled a first session for August 21, 1998. On August 20, 1998, counsel for the Respondent hand-delivered a document containing Spain's objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre. A copy of Spain's filing was distributed by the Centre to the Members of the Tribunal on that same date. A copy of Spain's filing was later handed by the Secretary of the Tribunal to the Claimant's representative in the course of the Tribunal's first session with the parties.\n\n11.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal with the parties was held, as scheduled, on August 21, 1998, at the seat of ICSID in Washington, D.C. At the session the parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect.\n\n12.\n\nDuring the course of the first session the parties agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. The Respondent, represented at the session by Mr. Rafael Andr\u00e9s Le\u00f3n Cavero, drew the Tribunal's attention to its objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre. The Tribunal, after briefly ascertaining the views of the parties on this matter, fixed the following time limits for the written phase of the proceedings: the Claimant would file a memorial, with all of his arguments on the question of jurisdiction and on the merits within 90 days from the date of the first session; the Respondent would then file a counter-memorial, with all of its arguments on the question of jurisdiction and on the merits within 90 days from its reception of the Claimant's memorial. The Tribunal left open the possibility of requiring the submission of a reply and a rejoinder to the parties. The Tribunal also left open the possibility of holding a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with the above-described schedule, the Claimant submitted to the Centre his memorial on the merits and on the question of jurisdiction on November 19, 1998. On April 9, 1999, after a request for an extension of the time limit for the filing of its counter-memorial was granted by the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted its written pleadings on the merits and on the question of jurisdiction.\n\n14.\n\nOn May 14, 1999, the Tribunal invited the parties to submit any further observations they may had on the question of jurisdiction, calling for a hearing on jurisdiction to be held on July 7, 1999, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. The parties filed their final observations on the question of jurisdiction on June 3, 1999 (the Claimant) and June 18, 1999 (the Respondent). Due to consecutive requests filed first by counsel for the Respondent, and later by counsel for the Claimant, the hearing on jurisdiction was postponed until August 9, 1999.\n\n15.\n\nAt the August 9, 1999 hearing, Dr. Ra\u00fal Emilio Vinuesa addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant, referring to the arguments put forward in his written pleadings. Mr. Rafael Andr\u00e9s Le\u00f3n Cavero addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain. The Tribunal then posed questions to the representatives of the parties, as provided in Rule 32(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n16.\n\nHaving heard the views of the parties, the Tribunal rendered, on August 26, 1999, Procedural Order No 1, deciding that, in accordance with Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41(3) of the Arbitration Rules, it would deal with the question of jurisdiction as a preliminary matter, therefore suspending the proceedings on the merits.\n\n17.\n\nOn October 28, 1999, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, addressing Spain's request for provisional measures. The Tribunal, pointing out that the recommendation of provisional measures seeking to protect mere expectations of success on the side of the Respondent would amount to a pre-judgement of the Claimant's case, unanimously dismissed Spain's request.\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered thoroughly the parties' written submissions on the question of jurisdiction and the oral arguments delivered in the course of the August 9, 1999 hearing on jurisdiction. As mentioned above, the consideration of the merits has been postponed until the issue of the Centre's jurisdiction and Tribunal's competence is decided by the Tribunal. Having considered the basic facts of the dispute, the ICSID Convention and the 1991 Argentine-Spain BIT, as well as the written and oral arguments of the parties' representatives, the Tribunal has reached the following decision on the question of jurisdiction.\n\n**B. Considerations**\n---------------------\n\n*Exhaustion of Domestic Remedies*\n---------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain first challenges the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal on the ground that the Claimant failed to comply with the requirements of Article X of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Argentina and Spain. Article X of this Treaty reads as follows:\n\n\"Article X\n\nSettlement of Disputes Between a Contracting Party and an Investor of the other Contracting Party\n\n1. Disputes which arise within the terms of this Agreement concerning an investment between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party shall, if possible, be settled amicably by the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If the dispute cannot thus be settled within six months following the date on which the dispute has been raised by either party, it shall be submitted to the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made.\n\n3. The dispute may be submitted to international arbitration in any of the following circumstances:\n\na) at the request of one of the parties to the dispute, if no decision has been rendered on the merits of the claim after the expiration of a period of eighteen months from the date on which the proceedings referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article have been initiated, or if such decision has been rendered, but the dispute between the parties continues;\n\nb) if both parties to the dispute agree thereto.\n\n4. In the cases foreseen in paragraph 3, the disputes between the parties shall be submitted, unless the parties otherwise agree, either to international arbitration under the 18 March 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States or to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\nIf after a period of three months following the submission of the dispute to arbitration by either party, there is no agreement to one of the above alternative procedures, the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration under the March 18, 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, provided that both Contracting Parties have become parties to the said Convention. Otherwise, the dispute shall be submitted to the above mentioned ad hoc tribunal.\n\n5. The Arbitral Tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the terms of other Agreements concluded between the parties, the law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, including its rules on conflict of laws, and general principles of international law.\n\n6. The Arbitral Award shall be binding on both parties to the dispute and each Contracting Party shall execute them in accordance with its laws.\"\n\n20.\n\nRespondent makes two interrelated arguments based on Article X. The first is that Article X(3)(a) requires the exhaustion of certain domestic remedies in Spain and that Claimant failed to comply with this requirement. The second contention is that Claimant did not submit the case to Spanish courts before referring it to international arbitration as required by Article X(2) of the BIT.\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the contention that Article X(3)(a) requires the exhaustion of domestic remedies. The starting point for its analysis of Respondent's submission is Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. It permits the Contracting States to condition their consent to ICSID arbitration on the prior exhaustion of domestic remedies. Article 26 reads as follows:\n\n\"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.\"\n\n22.\n\nThe language of Article 26 makes clear that unless a Contracting State has conditioned its consent to ICSID arbitration on the prior exhaustion of domestic remedies, no such requirement will be applicable. Article 26 thus reverses the traditional international law rule, which implies the exhaustion requirement unless it is expressly or implicitly waived.\n\n23.\n\nIn determining whether Spain conditioned its acceptance of the Centre's jurisdiction and the Tribunal's competence on the prior exhaustion of domestic remedies, the Tribunal notes that in ratifying the ICSID Convention, Spain did not attach any such condition to its acceptance of Article 26. But since Spain was free to do so in the BIT, the Tribunal must now examine whether Article X of that treaty requires the prior exhaustion of domestic remedies. Although Article X does not condition the reference to ICSID arbitration *expressis verbis* on the prior exhaustion of domestic remedies, it does speak of proceedings in domestic courts. It must be determined, therefore, whether that language can be interpreted to require the exhaustion of domestic remedies and, if so, what the scope of that requirement is.\n\n24.\n\nParagraph 2 of Article X provides that, if a dispute arises between an investor and one of the Contracting Parties to the BIT, and if that dispute cannot be resolved amicably within a period of six months, it shall be submitted to the competent tribunals of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made. Paragraph 3 of Article X then stipulates that the dispute may be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal in any of the following circumstances:\n\na) at the request of one of the parties to the dispute, if no decision has been rendered on the merits of the claim after the expiration of a period of eighteen months from the date on which the proceedings referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article have been initiated, or, if such decision has been rendered, but the dispute between the parties continues;\n\nb) if both parties to the dispute agree thereto.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent reads Article X(3)(a) to mean that, if a domestic court has rendered a decision on the merits on the issues in dispute within the prescribed period of eighteen months, the case can no longer be referred to international arbitration, irrespective of the holding of the court. This conclusion follows, in Respondent's view, because once the decision has been rendered, the dispute cannot be said to continue. Hence, if Claimant had referred the case to the Spanish courts and if those courts had passed on the merits of the case within the eighteen-month period, the dispute could no longer be submitted to the Centre under Article X. It follows, in Respondent's view, that Claimant's failure to give Spanish courts the opportunity to resolve the issues in dispute requires the Tribunal to rule that it is not competent to hear the instant case.\n\n26.\n\nClaimant admits that the dispute was not referred to a Spanish court prior to its submission to the Centre. He contends, however, that an analysis of the here relevant provisions of Article X indicates that a dispute does not have to be referred to a domestic court before it is submitted to international arbitration as long as the dispute continues and the eighteen-month period has expired. In Claimant's view this conclusion follows from the fact that Article X(3)(a) permits the reference of a case to international arbitration whether or not a domestic court decision has been rendered and regardless of its outcome.\n\n27.\n\nLike all other provisions of the BIT and in the absence of other specified applicable rules of interpretation, Article X must be interpreted in the manner prescribed by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. It provides that a treaty is to be \"interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" Applying this principle, it is to be noted that Article X(3)(a) does not say that a case may not be referred to arbitration if a domestic court has rendered a decision on the merits of the dispute within a period of eighteen months. It provides merely that if such a decision has been rendered and if the dispute continues, the case may be referred to arbitration.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, in this connection, that Article X(3)(a) does not require the exhaustion of domestic remedies as that concept is understood under international law.4 It speaks merely of a decision on the merits, which Respondent admits does not even have to be a final or non-appealable decision under Spanish law, and thus fails to require the exhaustion of all available domestic remedies.\n\nC. Schreuer, \"Commentary on the ICSID Convention. Article 25\", *Foreign Investment Law Journal, ICSID Review*, Vol. 12, 1997, 59, at 201.\n\n29.\n\nBut even if Article X(3)(a) were to be characterized as a provision requiring the exhaustion of domestic remedies, that requirement would not have the effect, contrary to Respondent's arguments, of preventing the subsequent reference of the case to international arbitration under the BIT. This is so because, where a treaty guarantees certain rights and provides for the exhaustion of domestic remedies before a dispute concerning these guarantees may be referred to an international tribunal, the parties to the dispute retain the right to take the case to that tribunal as long as they have exhausted the available remedies, and this regardless of the outcome of the domestic proceeding. They retain that remedy because the international tribunal rather than the domestic court has the final say on the meaning and scope of the international obligations\u2014in this case the BIT\u2014that are in dispute.5\n\nSee International Law Commission, Draft Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 22 and related Commentary, *1977 Yearbook of the International Law Commission,* Vol. II, Part 2, 1978, at 30 et seq. For the 1996 Draft and its referral to the 1977 Draft on this point, see *International Legal Materials*, Vol. 37, 1998, 444. See also C. F. Amerasinghe: *Local remedies in international law,* 1990, at 45-51.\n\n30.\n\nHere it is to be noted that the requirements of the exhaustion of domestic remedies differs depending on whether the appeal to an international tribunal contends that the domestic tribunal was guilty of a denial of justice, or whether the claim seeks the vindication of rights guaranteed in a treaty, for example, which empowers the tribunal to interpret and apply the treaty. In the former case, the right to appeal to an international tribunal, if it exists at all, can only be based on a denial of justice by the domestic courts. In such a case, if there was no denial of justice, the case will have to be rejected, whether or not the domestic court committed errors of law or fact in rendering its judgement. This is not true in a case where, as here, the parties have a treaty right to obtain a final determination from the international tribunal on the scope of their rights under the treaty, provided they have first exhausted all available domestic remedies.\n\n31.\n\nThe foregoing analysis is relevant in determining the soundness of Respondent's interpretation of Article X(3)(a) and its contention that pursuant to this provision a dispute cannot be deemed to continue if the domestic court has rendered a decision on the merits which addressed all issues raised by the parties. Leaving aside for a moment the wording of paragraph 3(a), Respondent's argument is based on the assumption that a case may be referred to international arbitration under the BIT only if there was a denial of justice by the domestic court. This proposition, if accepted, would have the effect of denying the party to a dispute the right to challenge the domestic court's interpretation of the BIT. Respondent's interpretation can be reconciled neither with the language nor object and purpose of the dispute resolution provisions of BITs in general and the instant BIT in particular. This is so because these clauses are designed to give foreign investors the right to have their disputes under a BIT decided either exclusively or ultimately by international arbitration.6\n\nSchreuer, loc. cit., supra note 4, at 199-202.\n\n32.\n\nMoreover, the wording of paragraph 3(a) does not support Respondent's submission on this subject. It contains no guidelines for deciding whether or under what circumstances a dispute may be deemed to continue. In the Tribunal's view, the absence of such objective criteria leaves each party free to decide for itself whether the dispute continues, that is, whether its claim has been vindicated by the domestic court, and to refer the case to international arbitration if it is not satisfied with the domestic court judgment. Had the Contracting Parties to the BIT wished to establish a different procedure, they would have done so.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Article X(3)(a) serves two important functions, which are not affected by the above interpretation. First, it permits either party to a dispute to seek redress from the appropriate domestic court. Second, it ensures that a party accessing the domestic court will not be prevented and will not be able to prevent the case from going to international arbitration after the expiration of the eighteen-month period. This is so whether or not the domestic court has rendered a decision and regardless of the decision it may have rendered.\n\n34.\n\nTurning to the second part of Respondent's argument, it must now be asked whether a party to a dispute, which has not referred the case to a domestic court, as required by Article X(2), must be deemed to have waived or forfeited the right to submit the matter to international arbitration. Here it is to be noted that paragraph 2 provides that the dispute \"shall be submitted\" (*ser\u00e1 sometida*) to the competent tribunals of the State Party where the investment was made, and that paragraph 3(a) then declares that the dispute \"may be submitted\" (*podr\u00e1 ser sometida*) to an international arbitral tribunal at the request of a party to the dispute in the following circumstances: if the domestic court has not rendered a decision on the merits of the case within a period of eighteen months or if, notwithstanding the existence of such a decision, the dispute continues.\n\n35.\n\nThis language suggests that the Contracting Parties to the BIT\u2014 Argentina and Spain\u2014wanted to give their respective courts the opportunity, within the specified period of eighteen months, to resolve the dispute before it could be taken to international arbitration. Claimant contends, however, that this could not have been the intended meaning of Article X(2), if only because at the end of that period either party would still be free to take the case to international arbitration, regardless of the outcome of the domestic court proceedings.\n\n36.\n\nHad this been the Claimant's sole argument on the issue, the Tribunal would have had to conclude that because the Claimant failed to submit the instant case to Spanish courts as required by Article X(2) of the BIT, the Centre lacked jurisdiction and the Tribunal lacked competence to hear the case. This is so because Claimant's submission on this point overlooks two important considerations. First, while it is true that the parties would be free to seek international arbitration after the expiration of the eighteen-month period, regardless of the outcome of the domestic court proceeding, they are likely to do so only if they were dissatisfied with the domestic court decision. Moreover, they would certainly not do so if they were convinced that the international tribunal would reach the same decision. In that sense the courts of the Contracting Parties are given an opportunity to vindicate the international obligations guaranteed in the BIT. Given the language of the treaty, this is a role which the Contracting Parties can be presumed to have wished to retain for their courts, albeit within a prescribed time limit. Second, Claimant's interpretation of Article X(2) would deprive this provision of any meaning, a result that would not be compatible with generally accepted principles of treaty interpretation, particularly those of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n37.\n\nAs noted above, had the Claimant's contention regarding Article X(2) stood alone, the Tribunal would have had to reject it. However, in view of the fact that Claimant argues in the alternative that he has the right to rely on the most favored nation clause contained in the BIT, dismissal of the application to the Tribunal without due consideration of this other argument would be premature. The Tribunal will accordingly now address the Claimant's alternative argument.\n\n*Most Favored Nation Clause*\n----------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe argument based on the most favored nation clause raises a number of legal issues with which international tribunals are confronted from time to time. As is true of many treaties of this kind, Article IV of the BIT between Argentina and Spain, after guaranteeing a fair and equitable treatment for investors, provides the following in paragraph 2:\n\n\"In all matters subject to this Agreement, this treatment shall not be less favorable than that extended by each Party to the investments made in its territory by investors of a third country.\"\n\n39.\n\nAs noted above, the Argentine-Spain BIT provides domestic courts with the opportunity to deal with a dispute for a period of eighteen months before it may be submitted to arbitration. However, Article 10(2) of the Chile-Spain Bilateral Investment Treaty, imposes no such condition. It provides merely that the investor can opt for arbitration after the six-month period allowed for negotiations has expired.\n\n40.\n\nClaimant contends, consequently, that Chilean investors in Spain are treated more favorably than Argentine investors in Spain. He argues, accordingly, that the most favored nation clause in the Argentine-Spain BIT gives him the option to submit the dispute to arbitration without prior referral to domestic courts. Claimant submits, in this connection, that although the Argentine-Spain BIT provides for exceptions to the most favored nation treatment, none of these apply to the dispute settlement provisions at issue in the instant case.\n\n41.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain rejects these contentions. In its view, the treaties made by Spain with third countries are in respect of Argentina *res inter alios acta* and, consequently, cannot be invoked by the Claimant. Respondent further argues that under the principle *ejusdem generis* the most favored nation clause can only operate in respect of the same matter and cannot be extended to matters different from those envisaged by the basic treaty. In Spain's view, this means that the reference in the most favored nation clause of the Argentine-Spain BIT to \"matters\" can only be understood to refer to substantive matters or material aspects of the treatment granted to investors and not to procedural or jurisdictional questions.\n\n42.\n\nIn this respect, Spain has also argued that since it is the purpose of the most favored nation clause to avoid discrimination, such discrimination can only take place in connection with material economic treatment and not with regard to procedural matters. Only if it could be established that resort to domestic tribunals would produce objective disadvantages for the investor would it be possible to argue material effects on the treatment owed. It follows, in the same line of argument, that it would have to be proved that the submission of the dispute to Spanish jurisdiction is less advantageous to the investor than its submission to ICSID arbitration.\n\n43.\n\nThe arguments outlined above are familiar to international lawyers and scholars. Indeed, many of the issues mentioned have been addressed in the *Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Case (Jurisdiction)*,7 in the *Case concerning the rights of nationals of the United States of America in Morocco*8and in the *Ambatielos Case (merits: obligation to arbitrate)*,9 as well as in the proceedings of the *Ambatielos case* before a Commission of Arbitration.10\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Reports*, 1952, p. 93. See also Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice: *The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice, 1951-1954: Points of Substantive Law. Part II*, p. 84.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Reports*, 1952, p. 176\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Reports*, 1953, p. 10. See also generally, *International Law Reports*, 1953, p. 547.\n\nAward of the Commission of Arbitration established for the Ambatielos claim between Greece and the United Kingdom, dated March 6, 1956, United Nations: *Reports of International Arbitral Awards,* Vol. XII, 1963, p. 91.\n\n44.\n\nIn addressing these issues, it must first be determined which is the basic treaty that governs the rights of the beneficiary of the most favored nation clause. This question was extensively discussed in the *Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Case*, where the International Court of Justice determined that the basic treaty upon which the Claimant could rely was that \"containing the most-favored-nation clause\".11 The Court then held that:\n\n\"It is this treaty which establishes the juridical link between the United Kingdom and a third-party treaty and confers upon that State the rights enjoyed by the third party. A third party treaty, independent of and isolated from the basic treaty, cannot produce any legal effect as between the United Kingdom and Iran: it is *res inter alios acta* \".12\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Reports*, 1952, at 109.\n\nIbid., at 109. For a discussion of this and other decisions relating to the most favored nation clause, the writings of authors and the work of the International Law Commission on the subject, see *Yearbook of the International Law Commission*, Vol. II, 1970, p. 199; Vol. II, 1973, p. 97; Vol. II, Part One, 1978, p. 1; Vol. II, Part Two, 1978, p. 7.\n\n45.\n\nThis discussion has practical consequences for the application of the most favored nation clause. For if, as the Tribunal believes, the right approach is to consider that the subject matter to which the clause applies is indeed established by the basic treaty, it follows that if these matters are more favorably treated in a third-party treaty then, by operation of the clause, that treatment is extended to the beneficiary under the basic treaty. If the third-party treaty refers to a matter not dealt with in the basic treaty, that matter is *res inter alios acta* in respect of the beneficiary of the clause.13\n\nIt was on this basis that the International Court of Justice ruled against the extension of principles of international law envisaged in treaties between Iran and third parties to the United Kingdom, as these principles were unrelated to the basic treaty containing the clause, Judgment cit., supra note 11.\n\n46.\n\nThe second major issue concerns the question whether the provisions on dispute settlement contained in a third-party treaty can be considered to be reasonably related to the fair and equitable treatment to which the most favored nation clause applies under basic treaties on commerce, navigation or investments and, hence, whether they can be regarded as a subject matter covered by the clause. This is the issue directly related to the *ejusdem generis* rule.\n\n47.\n\nThe question was indirectly but not conclusively touched upon in the *Case concerning the rights of nationals of the United States of America in Morocco*. Here, the International Court of Justice was confronted with the question of whether the clause contained in a treaty of commerce could be understood to cover consular jurisdiction as expressed in a third-party treaty. However, the Court did not need to answer the question posed because its main finding was that the treaties from which the United States purported to derive such jurisdictional rights had ceased to operate between Morocco and the third states involved.14\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Reports,* 1952, p. 191.\n\n48.\n\nThe issue came into sharp focus in the *Ambatielos case*. Greece contended before the International Court of Justice that her subject\u2014 Ambatielos\u2014had not been treated in the English courts according to the standards applied to British subjects and foreigners who enjoyed a most favored nation treatment under treaties in force. Such most favored nation treatment was relied upon as the basis of the claim and the request that the dispute be submitted to arbitration. The Court did not deal with the matter of the most favored nation clause, but this task would be undertaken by the Commission of Arbitration.\n\n49.\n\nThe Commission of Arbitration, to which the dispute was eventually submitted, subsequently confirmed the relevance of the *ejusdem generis* rule. It affirmed that \"the most-favored-nation clause can only attract matters belonging to the same category of subject as that to which the clause itself relates \".15 However, the scope of the rule was defined in broad terms:\n\n\"It is true that the \u2018administration of justice', when viewed in isolation, is a subject-matter other than \u2018commerce and navigation', but this is not necessarily so when it is viewed in connection with the protection of the rights of traders. Protection of the rights of traders naturally finds a place among the matters dealt with by treaties of commerce and navigation.\n\nTherefore it cannot be said that the administration of justice, in so far as it is concerned with the protection of these rights, must necessarily be excluded from the field of application of the most-favored-nation clause, when the latter includes \u2018all matters relating to commerce and navigation'. The question can only be determined in accordance with the intention of the Contracting Parties as deduced from a reasonable interpretation of the Treaty\".16\n\nUnited Nations, *Reports of International Arbitral Awards,* 1963, p. 107.\n\nIbid.\n\n50.\n\nThe Commission accepted the extension of the clause to questions concerning the administration of justice and found it to be compatible with the *ejusdem generis* rule. It concluded that the protection of the rights of persons engaged in commerce and navigation by means of dispute settlement provisions embraces the overall treatment of traders covered by the clause. On the merits of the question, the Commission determined, however, that the third-party treaties relied upon by Greece did not provide for any \"privileges, favours or immunities\" more extensive than those resulting from the basic treaty and that \"accordingly the most-favored-nation clause contained in Article X has no bearing on the present dispute...\".17\n\nIbid., at 109, 110.\n\n51.\n\nIt is in the light of this background that the operation of the most favored nation clause in bilateral investment treaties must now be considered by this Tribunal. In the case *Asian Agricultural Products Limited v. Republic of Sri Lanka*,18 an ICSID Tribunal had the occasion to examine the operation of the most favored nation treatment agreed to between Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom in light of the argument that a Sri Lanka-Switzerland treaty contained more favorable provisions on which the investor sought to rely. The provisions discussed, however, were not related to dispute settlement but only to the liability standards under the treaties in question. As in the *Ambatielos* decision rendered by the Commission of Arbitration, the ICSID Tribunal held that \"...it is not proven that the Sri Lanka/Switzerland Treaty contains rules more favourable than those provided for under the Sri Lanka/UK Treaty, and hence, Article 3 of the latter Treaty cannot be justifiably invoked in the present case\".19\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Limited v. Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case NoARB/87/ 3, Award of June 27, 1990, *ICSID Reports,* Vol. 4, p. 246.\n\nIbid., at 272\n\n52.\n\nA number of bilateral investment treaties have provided expressly that the most favored nation treatment extends to the provisions on settlement of disputes. This is particularly the case of investment treaties concluded by the United Kingdom. Thus, Article 3(3) of the Agreement between the United Kingdom and Albania, stipulates: \"For the avoidance of doubt it is confirmed that the treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agree-ment\".20 Among the enumerated provisions are the clauses on dispute settlement and the consent to submit to conciliation or arbitration under ICSID. Here it is beyond doubt that the parties intended the most favored nation clause to include dispute settlement in its scope, thereby meeting the test proposed by the *Ambatielos* Commission of Arbitration. Furthermore, the parties included this model clause in the Agreement with the express purpose of \"the avoidance of doubt\".\n\nAgreement between the United Kingdom and Albania, March 30, 1994. Twelve other agreements made by the United Kingdom, which the Tribunal has examined, contain the same model clause.\n\n53.\n\nIn other treaties the most favored nation clause speaks of \"all rights contained in the present Agreement\"21 or, as the basic Argentine-Spain BIT does, \"all matters subject to this Agreement\". These treaties do not provide expressly that dispute settlement as such is covered by the clause. Hence, like in the *Ambatielos* Commission of Arbitration it must be established whether the omission was intended by the parties or can reasonably be inferred from the practice followed by the parties in their treatment of foreign investors and their own investors.\n\nAgreement between Chile and the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union, July 15, 1992, Article 3 (3).\n\n54.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the basic treaty containing the clause does not refer expressly to dispute settlement as covered by the most favored nation clause, the Tribunal considers that there are good reasons to conclude that today dispute settlement arrangements are inextricably related to the protection of foreign investors, as they are also related to the protection of rights of traders under treaties of commerce. Consular jurisdiction in the past, like other forms of extraterritorial jurisdiction, were considered essential for the protection of rights of traders and, hence, were regarded not merely as procedural devices but as arrangements designed to better protect the rights of such persons abroad.22 It follows that such arrangements, even if not strictly a part of the material aspect of the trade and investment policy pursued by treaties of commerce and navigation, were essential for the adequate protection of the rights they sought to guarantee.\n\nSee, for example, *Magno Santovincenzo* v. *James F. Egan*, United States Supreme Court, Decision of November 23, 1931, *U.S. Reports*, Vol. 284, p. 30, where it was held that \"...the provisions of Article V of the Treaty were of special importance, as they provided for extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States in relation to the adjudication of disputes. It would thwart the major purpose of the Treaty to exclude from the important protection of these provisions citizens of the United States who might be domiciled in Persia\". For this and other domestic decisions concerning the most favored nation clause see International Law Commission, Decisions of national courts relating to the most-favoured-nation clause, Digest prepared by the Secretariat, Doc. A/CN.4/269, *Yearbook of the International Law Commission*, Vol. II, 1973, p. 117.\n\n55.\n\nInternational arbitration and other dispute settlement arrangements have replaced these older and frequently abusive practices of the past. These modern developments are essential, however, to the protection of the rights envisaged under the pertinent treaties; they are also closely linked to the material aspects of the treatment accorded. Traders and investors, like their States of nationality, have traditionally felt that their rights and interests are better protected by recourse to international arbitration than by submission of disputes to domestic courts, while the host governments have traditionally felt that the protection of domestic courts is to be preferred. The drafting history of the ICSID Convention provides ample evidence of the conflicting views of those favoring arbitration and those supporting policies akin to different versions of the Calvo Clause.23\n\nSee generally ICSID: *Analysis of Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention,* 1970.\n\n56.\n\nFrom the above considerations it can be concluded that if a third-party treaty contains provisions for the settlement of disputes that are more favorable to the protection of the investor's rights and interests than those in the basic treaty, such provisions may be extended to the beneficiary of the most favored nation clause as they are fully compatible with the *ejusdem generis* principle. Of course, the third-party treaty has to relate to the same subject matter as the basic treaty, be it the protection of foreign investments or the promotion of trade, since the dispute settlement provisions will operate in the context of these matters; otherwise there would be a contravention of that principle. This operation of the most favored nation clause does, however, have some important limits arising from public policy considerations that will be discussed further below.\n\n57.\n\nThe negotiations leading to the Argentine-Spain BIT evidence similar policy conflicts between the capital exporting country and the host country, that is, Spain and Argentina respectively, except that in the present case the roles were later reversed, with Argentina becoming the capital exporter and Spain the host country. The Claimant has convincingly explained that at the time of the negotiations of the Agreement, Argentina still sought to require some form of prior exhaustion of local remedies, while Spain supported the policy of a direct right of submission to arbitration, which was reflected in the numerous agreements it negotiated with other countries at that time. The eventual role the treaty envisaged for domestic courts, involving the submission of the dispute to these courts for a period of time, not amounting to the traditional exhaustion of local remedies requirement as explained above, coupled with ICSID arbitration, was an obvious compromise reached by the parties. Argentina later abandoned its prior policy, and like Spain and Chile, accepted treaty clauses providing for the direct submission of disputes to arbitration following a period of negotiations.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal has also examined in detail the practice followed by Spain in respect of bilateral investment treaties with other countries. These treaties indicate that Spain's preferred practice is to allow for arbitration, following a six-months effort to reach a friendly settlement, which is what the Chile-Spain BIT provides. In most cases there is a choice of arbitration under ICSID, but other options are available as well. This is the situation, for example, with regard to the treaties concluded by Spain with Algeria,24 Chile,25 Colombia,26 Cuba,27 Czechoslovakia,28 Dominican Republic,29 Egypt,30 El Salvador,31 Honduras,32 Hungary,33 Indonesia (twelve-month direct settlement effort),34 Kazajstan,35 Republic of Korea,36 Lithuania,37 Malaysia,38 Nicaragua,39 Pakistan,40 Peru,41 Philippines,42 Poland43 and Tunisia.44\n\nAgreement of December 23, 1994.\n\nAgreement of October 2, 1991.\n\nAgreement of July 9, 1995.\n\nAgreement of May 27, 1994.\n\nAgreement of December 12, 1990.\n\nAgreement of March 16, 1995.\n\nAgreement of November 3, 1992.\n\nAgreement of February 14, 1995.\n\nAgreement of March 18, 1994.\n\nAgreement of November 9, 1989.\n\nAgreement of May 30, 1995.\n\nAgreement of March 23, 1994.\n\nAgreement of January 17, 1994.\n\nAgreement of July 6, 1994.\n\nAgreement of April 4, 1995.\n\nAgreement of March 16, 1994.\n\nAgreement of September 15, 1994.\n\nAgreement of November 17, 1994.\n\nAgreement of October 19, 1993.\n\nAgreement of July 30, 1992.\n\nAgreement of May 28, 1991.\n\n59.\n\nSpain's treaty practice also shows that in a few cases a six-month or nine-month effort at a direct settlement is followed by arbitration between the Contracting Parties, but not involving the choice of the investor. This is, for example, the case of the treaties with Bolivia,45 Morocco46 and the USSR.47 Only one other treaty, namely that with Uruguay,48 follows the model of the Argentine-Spain BIT, probably because of the similarity of policies pursued by the two River Plate nations.\n\nAgreement of April 24, 1990.\n\nAgreement of January 15, 1992.\n\nAgreement of November 28, 1991.\n\nAgreement of April 7, 1992.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that of all the Spanish treaties it has been able to examine, the only one that speaks of \"all matters subject to this Agreement\" in its most favored nation clause, is the one with Argentina. All other treaties, including those with Uruguay and Chile, omit this reference and merely provide that \"this treatment\" shall be subject to the clause, which is of course a narrower formulation.\n\n61.\n\nThe Spanish treaty practice is also relevant in connection with another aspect of the clause. Most treaties concluded by Spain have a model clause to the effect that \"...Each Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment for the investments made by investors of the other Party...This treatment shall not be less favourable than that extended by each Party to the investments made in its territory by its own investors...\".49 While this clause applies to national treatment of foreign investors, it may also be understood to embrace the treatment required by a Government for its investors abroad, as evidenced by the treaties made to ensure their protection. Hence, if a Government seeks to obtain a dispute settlement method for its investors abroad, which is more favorable than that granted under the basic treaty to foreign investors in its territory, the clause may be construed so as to require a similar treatment of the latter.\n\nSee, for example, the Algeria-Spain Agreement of December 23, 1994, Article 4.\n\n62.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the application of the most favored nation clause to dispute settlement arrangements in the context of investment treaties might result in the harmonization and enlargement of the scope of such arrangements, there are some important limits that ought to be kept in mind. As a matter of principle, the beneficiary of the clause should not be able to override public policy considerations that the contracting parties might have envisaged as fundamental conditions for their acceptance of the agreement in question, particularly if the beneficiary is a private investor, as will often be the case. The scope of the clause might thus be narrower than it appears at first sight.\n\n63.\n\nHere it is possible to envisage a number of situations not present in the instant case. First, if one contracting party has conditioned its consent to arbitration on the exhaustion of local remedies, which the ICSID Convention allows, this requirement could not be bypassed by invoking the most favored nation clause in relation to a third-party agreement that does not contain this element since the stipulated condition reflects a fundamental rule of international law.50 Second, if the parties have agreed to a dispute settlement arrangement which includes the so-called fork in the road, that is, a choice between submission to domestic courts or to international arbitration, and where the choice once made becomes final and irreversible,51 this stipulation cannot be bypassed by invoking the clause. This conclusion is compelled by the consideration that it would upset the finality of arrangements that many countries deem important as a matter of public policy. Third, if the agreement provides for a particular arbitration forum, such as ICSID, for example, this option cannot be changed by invoking the clause, in order to refer the dispute to a different system of arbitration. Finally, if the parties have agreed to a highly institutionalized system of arbitration that incorporates precise rules of procedure, which is the case, for example, with regard to the North America Free Trade Agreement and similar arrangements, it is clear that neither of these mechanisms could be altered by the operation of the clause because these very specific provisions reflect the precise will of the contracting parties. Other elements of public policy limiting the operation of the clause will no doubt be identified by the parties or tribunals. It is clear, in any event, that a distinction has to be made between the legitimate extension of rights and benefits by means of the operation of the clause, on the one hand, and disruptive treaty-shopping that would play havoc with the policy objectives of underlying specific treaty provisions, on the other hand.\n\n*The Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* (Greece v. U.K.), Permanent Court of International Justice, 1924, Series A. No. 2, 12; *Interhandel Case* (Switzerland v. United States of America), International Court of Justice, *Reports 1959,* 27.\n\nSee, for example, the Chile-Spain BIT of October 2, 1991, Article 10(2).\n\n64.\n\nIn light of the above considerations, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant has convincingly demonstrated that the most favored nation clause included in the Argentine-Spain BIT embraces the dispute settlement provisions of this treaty. Therefore, relying on the more favorable arrangements contained in the Chile-Spain BIT and the legal policy adopted by Spain with regard to the treatment of its own investors abroad, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant had the right to submit the instant dispute to arbitration without first accessing the Spanish courts. In the Tribunal's view, the requirement for the prior resort to domestic courts spelled out in the Argentine-Spain BIT does not reflect a fundamental question of public policy considered in the context of the treaty, the negotiations relating to it, the other legal arrangements or the subsequent practice of the parties. Accordingly, the Tribunal affirms the jurisdiction of the Centre and its own competence in this case in respect of this aspect of the challenge made by the Kingdom of Spain.\n\n*The Claimant's Standing*\n-------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent has also challenged the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Tribunal's competence on a different ground, namely, that the Claimant lacks standing to file this request for arbitration because he is not an investor within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Respondent points out that under Article 25(1), the Centre has jurisdiction only over disputes arising directly out of an investment \"between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State.\" Although Claimant is an Argentine national, his claim against the Kingdom of Spain is based, in Respondent's view, on injuries allegedly suffered by EAMSA, a Spanish juridical entity established and largely owned by Claimant. As a Spanish company, EAMSA has a juridical personality separate and distinct from its shareholders. Respondent argues that as long as the company continues to exist *qua* company, a shareholder in Claimant's position has no standing to seek to lift the corporate veil and sue in his personal capacity for damages sustained by the company. According to this view, the Claimant would have only very limited grounds upon which to sue for eventual wrongdoings that might affect him personally, but in any event such acts could not be attributed to the Kingdom of Spain.\n\n66.\n\nClaimant emphasizes that he is not bringing this case on behalf of EAMSA. He contends, instead, that he has filed this action in his personal capacity as a foreign (Argentine) investor in the Spanish company (EAMSA) to protect his investment in that company. In support of his arguments, Claimant points, *inter alia*, to Articles I(2) and II(2) of the BIT and argues that these provisions define \"investments\" broadly in the sense that they cover all types of property and rights to property, including investments made or acquired in the host country.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 25 of the Convention must be read together with two provisions of the BIT, which are of particular relevance in analyzing the above contentions of the parties. The first of these is Article I(2) of the BIT, which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The term \u2018investment' means every kind of asset, such as goods and rights of whatever nature, acquired or made in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made, and shall include, in particular though not exclusively, the following: shares in stock or any other form of participation in a company.\"\n\nThe other provision is Article II(2), which stipulates:\n\n\"The present Agreement shall apply to capital investments in the territory of one Contracting Party, made in accordance with its legislation prior to the entry into force of the Agreement. However this Agreement shall not apply to disputes or claims originating before its entry into force.\"\n\n68.\n\nThese provisions indicate that capital investments are covered by the BIT. They also provide that individuals having the nationality of one of the Contracting Parties, who invest in corporations or similar legal entities created in the territory of the other Contracting Party, are as a general proposition entitled to claim the protection of that treaty. These provisions complement and are consistent with the requirements of Article 25 of the Convention. Claimants' assertions as to his standing to file this case are fully compatible with these stipulations.\n\n69.\n\nThe foregoing conclusion does not mean that Claimant has in fact proved that he has made out a valid claim for damages sustained by him in his personal capacity. He will have to do that in the proceedings on the merits in order to win his case. At this stage of the proceedings, however, it is enough for him to demonstrate that, if true, his allegations would give him standing to bring this case in his personal capacity.\n\n70.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Claimant has sustained that burden. He is an Argentine investor in a Spanish company, who brings this action ostensibly to protect his investment in that company and for losses incurred by him due to injurious acts he attributes to Respondent. If proved, these facts would entitle Claimant to invoke the protection of the BIT in his personal capacity. (Convention, Art. 25; BIT, Arts. I(2) and II(2)). Accordingly, Claimant can be said to have made out a *prima facie* case that he has standing to file this case.\n\n*SODIGA's Status in the Kingdom of Spain*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Respondent's contention that the instant dispute is not between the Kingdom of Spain and the Claimant, as alleged by the Claimant, but between the Claimant and the private corporation \"Sociedad para el Desarrollo Industrial de Galicia\" (SODIGA), with which the Claimant made various contractual dealings.\n\n72.\n\nThe issue here can be summarized as follows. The Claimant argues that the actions and omissions affecting his investment are attributable to an entity owned and operated by the Kingdom of Spain. SODIGA, the Claimant argues, is not only owned by several State entities, but it is also under the control of the State and operated as an arm of the State for the purposes of the economic development of the region of Galicia. Accordingly, as a State entity, its wrongful acts or omission may be attributed to the State.\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent maintains, however, that SODIGA is a private commercial corporation established under the commercial laws of Spain and that, consequently, its activities are those of a private entity. Ownership of part of the shares of SODIGA by State entities, the Respondent argues, does not alter the private commercial character of the corporation nor does it transform SODIGA into a State agency. Its acts or omissions cannot, therefore, be attributed to the State.\n\n74.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention, the Centre's jurisdiction extends only to legal disputes arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State.52 Just as the Centre has no jurisdiction to arbitrate disputes between two States, it also lacks jurisdiction to arbitrate disputes between two private entities. Its main jurisdictional feature is to decide disputes between a private investor and a State.53 However, neither the term \"national of another Contracting State\" nor the term \"Contracting State\" are defined in the Convention. Some elements outlined in the Convention in respect of the standing of a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State or the modalities of consent in their respect,54 neither help in this case.55 The Convention contains no criteria dealing with the attribution to the State of acts or omissions undertaken by such State entities, subdivisions or agencies. The Argentine-Spanish BIT does not assist either in this determination. While it speaks of actions of State authorities (\" *autoridades de una Parte\"*), it does not define the phrase.56\n\nICSID Convention, Article 25(1).\n\nAron Broches: \"The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes: Some Observations on Jurisdiction\", *Columbia Journal of International Law*, Vol. 5, 1966, 263, at 265.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 25(1) and 25(3). See C. Schreuer: \"Commentary on the ICSID Convention. Article 25\", *Foreign Investment Law Journal\u2014ICSID Review*, Vol. 11, 1996, 318, at 380-391; Schreuer, loc. cit., supra note 4, at 140-150.\n\nSODIGA is not a party to this case and no designation has been made or consent has been given by Spain to this effect.\n\nArgentine-Spain BIT, Article V.\n\n75.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal has to answer the following two questions: first, whether or not SODIGA is a State entity for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal, and second, whether the actions and omissions complained of by the Claimant are imputable to the State. While the first issue is one that can be decided at the jurisdictional stage of these proceedings, the second issue bears on the merits of the dispute and can be finally resolved only at that stage.\n\n76.\n\nSince neither the Convention nor the Argentine-Spanish BIT establish guiding principles for deciding the here relevant issues, the Tribunal may look to the applicable rules of international law in deciding whether a particular entity is a state body. These standards have evolved and been applied in the context of the law of State responsibility. Here, the test that has been developed looks to various factors, such as ownership, control, the nature, purposes and objectives of the entity whose actions are under scrutiny, and to the character of the actions taken.57\n\nIan Brownlie: *System of the Law of Nations. State Responsibility. Part I*, 1983, 132 et seq.\n\n77.\n\nThe question whether or not SODIGA is a State entity must be examined first from a formal or structural point of view. Here a finding that the entity is owned by the State, directly or indirectly, gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that it is a State entity. The same result will obtain if an entity is controlled by the State, directly or indirectly. A similar presumption arises if an entity's purpose or objectives is the carrying out of functions which are governmental in nature or which are otherwise normally reserved to the State, or which by their nature are not usually carried out by private businesses or individuals.\n\n78.\n\nThe relevance of these standards is clearer when there is a direct State operation and control, such as by a section or division of a Ministry, but less so when the State chooses to act through a private sector mechanism, such as a corporation (*sociedad anonima*) or some other corporate structure. In any event, a State will not necessarily escape responsibility for wrongful acts or omissions by hiding behind a private corporate veil.58 Paragraph 2 of Article 7 of the International Law Commission's *Draft Articles on State Responsibility*, supports this position:\n\n\"2. The conduct of an organ of an entity which is not part of the formal structure of the State or of a territorial governmental entity, but which is empowered by the internal law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority, shall be considered as an act of the State under international law, provided the organ was acting in such capacity in the case in question. \"59\n\nSee generally Brownlie, op. cit, supra note 57, at 135-137.\n\nInternational Law Commission: \"Draft Articles on State Responsibility\", 1996, *Inter* *national Legal Materials*, Vol. 37, 1998, 444.\n\n79.\n\nBecause of the many forms that State enterprises may take and thus shape the manners of State action, the structural test by itself may not always be a conclusive determination whether an entity is an organ of the State or whether its acts may be attributed to the State. An additional test has been developed, a functional test, which looks to the functions of or role to be performed by the entity.60 Although, as noted above, neither the ICSID Convention nor the Argentine-Spain BIT define a Contracting State, the drafting history of the Convention does cover an analogous situation: whether mixed economy companies or government-owned corporations may be considered under the definition of a \"national of a Contracting State\". While recognizing, of course, that definitions of different terms are not usually interchangeable and that, in this case, a \"Contracting State\" is different from a \"national of a Contracting State\", there are sufficient similarities which would allow us to utilize jurisprudence developed for one definition in the context of the other. Thus, a determination as to the character of state-owned enterprises in the context of whether it is a \"national of a Contracting State\", may also be relevant in determining whether a state enterprise may be subsumed within the definition of the term \"Contracting Party\". In this connection, it is relevant to note, as explained by a leading authority on the Convention, that it would seem that \"a mixed economy company or government-owned corporation should not be disqualified as a \u2018national of another Contracting State' unless it is acting as an agent for the government or is discharging an essentially governmental function\".61\n\nBrownlie, op. cit., supra note 57, at 136.\n\nAron Broches: \"The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States\", *Recueil des Cours de l'Academie de Droit International,* 1972, at 355.\n\n80.\n\nThis functional test has been applied, in respect of the definition of a national of a Contracting State, in the recent decision of an ICSID Tribunal on objections to jurisdiction in the case of *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A. S.* v. *the Slovak Republic*.62 Here it was held that the fact of State ownership of the shares of the corporate entity was not enough to decide the crucial issue of whether the Claimant had standing under the Convention as a national of a Contracting State as long as the activities themselves were \"essentially commercial rather than governmental in nature\".63 By the same token, a private corporation operating for profit while discharging essentially governmental functions delegated to it by the State could, under the functional test, be considered as an organ of the State and thus engage the State's international responsibility for wrongful acts.\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A. S.* v. *the Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/ 4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, May 24, 1999, *ICSID Review\u2014Foreign Investment Law Journal,* Vol. 14, 1999, at 250.\n\nIbid., par. 20.\n\n81.\n\nIt is difficult to determine, *a priori*, whether these various tests and standards need necessarily be cumulative. It is likely that there are circumstances when they need not be. Of course, when all or most of the tests result in a finding of State action, the result, while still merely a presumption, comes closer to being conclusive.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal is also of the view that a domestic determination, be it legal, judicial or administrative, as to the juridical structure of an entity undertaking functions which may be classified as governmental, while it is to be given considerable weight, is not necessarily binding on an international arbitral tribunal. Whether an entity is to be regarded as an organ of the State and whether this might ultimately engage its responsibility, is a question of fact and law to be determined under the applicable principles of international law.64\n\nBrownlie, op. cit., supra note 57, at 136. See also International Law Commission, Draft Articles cit., supra note 59, Article 4.\n\n83.\n\nIn the light of these considerations, the Tribunal notes, first, that SODIGA was created by a decree issued by the Ministry of Industry (*Ministerio de Industria*) which authorized the National Institute for Industry (*Instituto Nacional de Industria*), a national State agency, to establish SODIGA. The characterization of the Ministry and the Institute as State entities is not disputed in this case. Furthermore, in spite of the fact that the government chose to create SODIGA in the form of a private commercial corporation, it did so by providing that the Instituto Nacional de Industria would own no less than 51% of the capital. In fact, as of December 31, 1990, the percentage of governmentally owned capital of SODIGA had increased to over 88%, including the stock holdings of the Xunta de Galicia, also a state entity in charge of the executive power in the Autonomous Community of Galicia,65 several savings and loans associations (*cajas de ahorros*), other regional development agencies and the Banco Exterior de Espa\u00f1a.\n\nThe Xunta is defined as the collegiate body of the Government of Galicia. See http:// galicia97.vieiros.com\n\n84.\n\nHowever, the intent of the State to create still another a corporate entity, particularly one which is intended to operate in the private sector, even if State owned, is not sufficient to raise the presumption of an entity being an organ of the State. More is required in terms of the functional test discussed above.\n\n85.\n\nIn this instance, however, it is clear from the background leading to the establishment of SODIGA that the intent of the Government of Spain was to create an entity to carry out governmental functions. In fact, the proposal to create SODIGA originated in the *Ministerio de Industria* ; its creation was vetted and approved by the Ministry of Finance (*Ministerio de Hacienda*); and its creation was discussed and approved at a meeting of the Council of Ministers (*Consejo de Ministros*), one of the highest policy organs of the Government of Spain.66 The participation of these government bodies in the creation of SODIGA points to the fact that it was established to carry out governmental functions in the field of regional development.\n\nDecreto 2182/1972, *Boletin Oficial del Estado*, No. 197, August 17, 1972, p. 1536.\n\n86.\n\nThis intention is evidenced, for example, in the preamble to the decree. It declares that one of the purposes for SODIGA's creation is the promotion of regional industrial development of the Autonomous Region of Galicia. (\"... *[S]e considera urgente la constitucion de una Sociedad que, con la finalidad especifica de impulsar el desarrollo industrial de Galicia,...\"*). Furthermore, it can be seen that it was the intent of the Government of Spain to utilize SODIGA as an instrument of State action. Among its functions was the undertaking of studies for the introduction of new industries into Galicia, seeking and soliciting such new industries, investing in new enterprises, processing loan applications with official sources of financing, providing guarantees for such loans, and providing technical assistance. Moreover, either through the *Instituto Nacional de Industria* or directly, SODIGA was charged with providing subsidies and offering other inducements for the development of industries. Many of these objectives and functions are by their very nature typically governmental tasks, not usually carried out by private entities, and, therefore, cannot normally be considered to have a commercial nature.\n\n87.\n\nWhile it is possible that the Spanish State could have out-sourced such development activities to a private, non-governmental, corporate entity, this was not the case here. But, as explained above, even if it had been the case, under the functional test this would not have necessarily delinked the Spanish State from the entity as its functions would have been delegated by the State and they could still be government functions in the light of international law.\n\n88.\n\nMany countries besides Spain have created regional development agencies. These agencies have been created around the world and operate as governmental entities, whether in the form of direct State agencies, territorial or regional agencies or, as in the case of SODIGA, as corporations. It is relevant to note, in this connection, that the World Bank has established an office, the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), one of whose functions is to provide technical assistance and consulting services to governments to assist with the creation and operation of industrial and other development organizations.\n\n89.\n\nIn view of the fact that SODIGA meets both the structural test of State creation and capital ownership and the functional test of performing activities of a public nature, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has made out a *prima facie* case that SODIGA is a State entity acting on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain. Whether SODIGA is responsible for the specific acts and omissions complained of, whether they are wrongful, whether all these acts or omissions always were governmental rather than commercial in character, and, hence, whether they can be attributed to the Spanish State, are questions to be decided during the proceedings on the merits of the case.\n\n*Time of the Dispute*\n---------------------\n\n90.\n\nA last challenge of the Respondent to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal rests on the argument that the alleged dispute originates in its view before the entry into force of the BIT between Argentina and Spain. This argument is in turn connected with the issue of the existence of a dispute and whether it qualifies as a legal dispute, but these other aspects belong also to the merits of the claim.\n\n91.\n\nArticle II(2) of the Argentine-Spain BIT provides in part: \"However, this agreement shall not apply to disputes or claims originating before its entry into force.\"\n\n92.\n\nThe Argentine-Spain BIT entered into force on September 28, 1992, and because of the Claimant's argument about the relevance of the most-favored-nation clause in respect of the Chile-Spain BIT, the Kingdom of Spain also argues that the latter treaty only entered into force on March 29, 1994. Accordingly, Spain submits that for the Centre to have jurisdiction the dispute should originate after this last date or, in any event, after the date of entry into force of the Argentine-Spain BIT. Considering that the Claimant relies on facts and events that took place as early as 1989 and throughout 1990, 1991, and the first part of 1992, Spain contends that the BIT does not apply to the dispute.\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimant rejects this view on the ground that a \"dispute\" arises when it is formally presented as such, and this happened only after both the Argentine-Spain and the Chile-Spain BIT had entered into force. He contends, moreover, that before the dispute can be deemed to have arisen, there may have been disagreements and differences of opinion between the parties, but these events do not amount to a dispute as this concept is understood in international and domestic law.\n\n94.\n\nThese differing views of the parties as to the meaning of a dispute and when it becomes identified or recognized as such, are quite common in ICSID and other arbitral or judicial proceedings.67 The International Court of Justice has defined a dispute on various occasions by declaring that it is \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between parties.\"68 It has been rightly commented in this respect that the \"dispute must relate to clearly identified issues between the parties and must not be merely academic...The dispute must go beyond general grievances and must be susceptible of being stated in terms of a concrete claim\".69\n\n*AGIP* v. *Congo*, ICSID Case ARB/77/1, Award of November 30, 1979, *ICSID Reports,* Vol. 1, 306.\n\nInternational Court of Justice: *Case concerning East Timor*, *ICJ Reports 1995,* 90, para. 22, with reference to earlier decisions of both the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice.\n\nC. Schreuer, loc. cit., (1996), supra note 54, at 337.\n\n95.\n\nIn the present case it is quite clear, as the Kingdom of Spain has argued, that the events on which the parties disagreed began as early as 1989. Issues such as budget estimates, requirements of environmental impact assessment, disinvestment, and other, were indeed discussed during the period 1989-1992. But this does not mean that a legal dispute as defined by the International Court of Justice can be said to have existed at the time.\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this respect that there tends to be a natural sequence of events that leads to a dispute. It begins with the expression of a disagreement and the statement of a difference of views. In time these events acquire a precise legal meaning through the formulation of legal claims, their discussion and eventual rejection or lack of response by the other party. The conflict of legal views and interests will only be present in the latter stage, even though the underlying facts predate them. It has also been rightly commented that the existence of the dispute presupposes a minimum of communications between the parties, one party taking up the matter with the other, with the latter opposing the Claimant's position directly or indirectly.70 This sequence of events has to be taken into account in establishing the critical date for determining when under the BIT a dispute qualifies as one covered by the consent necessary to establish ICSID's jurisdiction.\n\nIbid., at 337, with particular reference to *AALP* v. *Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case NoARB/87/ 3, Award of June 27, 1990, *ICSID Reports,* Vol. 4, 251.\n\n97.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Kingdom of Spain has correctly argued that there is a difference between a dispute and a claim in terms of Article II(2) of the Argentine-Spain BIT. While a dispute may have emerged, it does not necessarily have to coincide with the presentation of a formal claim. The critical date will in fact separate, not the dispute from the claim, but the dispute from prior events that do not entail a conflict of legal views and interests. It follows that if the dispute arises after the critical date it will qualify for its transformation into a claim, while if the dispute has arisen before such date it will be excluded by the terms of the BIT.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that in this case the dispute in its technical and legal sense began to take shape in 1994, particularly in the context of the disinvestment proposals discussed between the parties. At that point, the conflict of legal views and interests came to be clearly established, leading not long thereafter to the presentation of various claims that eventually came to this Tribunal. That is to say, this dispute came into being after both the Argentine-Spain and the Chile-Spain BITs had entered into force, although the critical date here is the date of entry into force of the former, since this is the basic treaty relevant in this case. It is on this basis that the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Centre has jurisdiction and that the Tribunal is competent to consider the dispute between the parties in accordance with the provisions of Article II(2)of the Argentine-Spain BIT.\n\n**C. Decision**\n---------------\n\n99.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously decides that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal. The Tribunal has, accordingly, made the necessary Order for the continuation of the procedure pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4)."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2000-11-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**A.

Summary of the Procedure**\n-------------------------------\n\n*1. Procedure Leading to the Decision on Jurisdiction*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn July 18, 1997, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) received from Mr. Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini a Request for Arbitration against the Kingdom of Spain. The request concerned a dispute arising from treatment allegedly received by Mr. Maffezini from Spanish entities, in connection with his investment in an enterprise for the production and distribution of chemical products in the Spanish region of Galicia. In his request the Claimant invoked the provisions of the 1991 \"Agreement for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Argentine Republic\" (the Argentine-Spain Bilateral Investment Treaty or BIT).1 The request also invoked, by way of a most-favored-nation (MFN) clause in the Argentine-Spain BIT, the provisions of a 1991 bilateral investment treaty between the Republic of Chile (Chile) and Spain.2\n\nAgreement between Argentina and Spain of October 3, 1991. Hereinafter cited as the Argentine-Spain BIT.\n\nAgreement between Chile and Spain of October 2, 1991. Hereinafter cited as the ChileSpain BIT.\n\n5.\n\nOn August 8, 1997, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), acknowledged receipt of the request and on the same day transmitted a copy to the Kingdom of Spain and to the Spanish Embassy in Washington, D.C. At the same time, the Centre asked Mr. Maffezini to provide (i) specific information concerning the issues in dispute and the character of the underlying investment; (ii) information as to the complete terms of Spain's consent to submit the dispute to arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the ICSID Convention); (iii) information as to the basis of his claim that the MFN clause in the Argentine-Spain BIT would allow him to invoke Spain's consent contained in the Chile-Spain BIT; and (iv) documentation concerning the entry into force of the bilateral investment treaties invoked in the request. Mr. Maffezini provided this information in two letters of September 10 and September 29, 1997.\n\n6.\n\nOn October 30, 1997, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On this same date, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the request and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n7.\n\nOn December 22, 1997, the Claimant proposed to the Respondent that the Arbitral Tribunal consist of a sole arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the parties. The Claimant further proposed that, if the parties fail to agree in the name of the sole arbitrator by January 31, 1998, the sole arbitrator shall be appointed by ICSID's Secretary-General.\n\n8.\n\nOn March 5, 1998, Spain having failed to respond to the Claimant's proposal and more that 60 days having elapsed since the registration of the request, the Claimant informed the Secretary-General that he was choosing the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal, therefore, would consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by Mr. Maffezini, one appointed by Spain, and the third, presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n9.\n\nOn March 18, 1998, the Centre received a communication from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Finance, whereby Spain anticipated having objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and to the competence of the Tribunal, providing the Centre with a summary of the grounds on which such objections were based. The Centre promptly informed the Respondent that a copy of this communication, as well as copies of the request for arbitration and its accompanying documentation, of the notice of registration and of the correspondence exchanged between the parties and the Centre would be transmitted, in due course, to each of the Members of the Tribunal, noting that the question of jurisdiction was one for the Tribunal to decide.\n\n10.\n\nOn April 24, 1998, Mr. Maffezini appointed Professor Thomas Buergenthal, a national of the United States of America, as an arbitrator. On May 4, 1998, Spain appointed Mr. Maurice Wolf, also a national of the United States of America, as an arbitrator. The parties, however, failed to agree on the appointment of the third, presiding, arbitrator. In these circumstances, by means of a further communication of May 14, 1998, the Claimant requested that the third, presiding, arbitrator in the proceeding be appointed by the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the Arbitration Rules.3\n\nUnder Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the Arbitration Rules, if the Tribunal is not yet constituted within 90 days after the notice of registration of the request has been dispatched, the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council shall, at the request of either party, and after consulting both parties as far as possible, appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed and designate an arbitrator to be the President of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nHaving consulted with the parties, the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council appointed Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a Chilean national, as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal. On June 24, 1998, ICSID's Legal Adviser, on behalf of the Centre's Secretary-General, and in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nOn July 3, 1998, the Respondent filed an application for provisional measures, requiring the Claimant to post a guaranty in the amount of the costs expected to be incurred by Spain in defending against this action. By further filing of August 7, 1998, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to dismiss such application.\n\n13.\n\nAfter consulting with the parties, the Tribunal scheduled a first session for August 21, 1998. On August 20, 1998, counsel for the Respondent hand-delivered a document containing Spain's objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre. A copy of Spain's filing was distributed by the Centre to the Members of the Tribunal on that same date. A copy of Spain's filing was later handed by the Secretary of the Tribunal to the Claimant's representative in the course of the Tribunal's first session with the parties.\n\n14.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal with the parties was held, as scheduled, on August 21, 1998, at the seat of ICSID in Washington, D.C. At the session, the parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, and that they did not have any objections in this respect. The Tribunal hereby states that it was therefore established under the Convention.\n\n15.\n\nDuring the course of the first session the parties agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. Spanish was chosen by the parties as the procedural language and Washington, D.C., the seat of the Centre, was selected as the formal place of proceedings. The Respondent, represented at the session by Mr. Rafael Andr\u00e9s Le\u00f3n Cavero, drew the Tribunal's attention to its objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre. The Tribunal, after briefly ascertaining the views of the parties on this matter, fixed the following time limits for the written phase of the proceedings: the Claimant would file a memorial, with all of his arguments on the question of jurisdiction and on the merits within 90 days from the date of the first session; the Respondent would then file a counter-memorial, with all of its arguments on the question of jurisdiction and on the merits within 90 days from its reception of the Claimant's memorial. The Tribunal left open the possibility of requiring the submission of a reply and a rejoinder to the parties. The Tribunal also left open the possibility of holding a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction.\n\n16.\n\nIn accordance with the above-described schedule, the Claimant submitted to the Centre his memorial on the merits and on the question of jurisdiction on November 19, 1998. On April 9, 1999, after a request for an extension of the time limit for the filing of its counter-memorial was granted by the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted its written pleadings on the merits and on the question of jurisdiction.\n\n17.\n\nOn May 14, 1999, the Tribunal invited the parties to submit any further observations they may had on the question of jurisdiction, calling for a hearing on jurisdiction to be held on July 7, 1999, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. The parties filed their final observations on the question of jurisdiction on June 3, 1999 (the Claimant) and June 18, 1999 (the Respondent). Due to consecutive requests filed first by counsel for the Respondent, and later by counsel for the Claimant, the hearing on jurisdiction was postponed until August 9, 1999.\n\n18.\n\nAt the August 9, 1999 hearing, Dr. Ra\u00fal Emilio Vinuesa addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant, referring to the arguments put forward in his written pleadings. Mr. Rafael Andr\u00e9s Le\u00f3n Cavero addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain. The Tribunal then posed questions to the representatives of the parties, as provided in Rule 32(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n19.\n\nHaving heard the views of the parties, the Tribunal rendered, on August 26, 1999, Procedural Order No 1, deciding that, in accordance with Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41(3) of the Arbitration Rules, it would deal with the question of jurisdiction as a preliminary matter, therefore suspending the proceedings on the merits.\n\n20.\n\nOn October 28, 1999, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, addressing Spain's request for provisional measures. The Tribunal, pointing out that the recommendation of provisional measures seeking to protect mere expectations of success on the side of the Respondent would amount to a prejudgement of the Claimant's case, unanimously dismissed Spain's request. Certified copies of the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 2 were distributed to the parties by the Secretary of the Tribunal. A copy of Procedural Order No. 2 is attached to the present Award as an integral part of such.\n\n21.\n\nOn January 25, 2000 the Tribunal, having deliberated by correspondence, issued its unanimous Decision on the Objections to Jurisdiction raised by the Kingdom of Spain. In its Decision, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent's contention that the Claimant failed to comply with an exhaustion of local remedies requirement set forth in Article X of the Argentine-Spain BIT. Also, in light of the application of the most favored nation clause included in the Argentine-Spain BIT, and therefore relying on the more favorable arrangements contained in the Chile-Spain BIT, the Tribunal rejected Spain's contention that the Claimant should have submitted the case to Spanish courts before referring it to international arbitration under Article X(2) of the BIT, and concluded that the Claimant had the right to submit the instant dispute to arbitration without first accessing the Spanish courts. Finally, the Tribunal, addressing the other objections to jurisdiction raised by Spain, concluded that the Claimant had made out a *prima facie* case that he had standing to file this case, that the *Sociedad para el Desarrollo Industrial de Galicia Sociedad Anonima* (SODIGA S.A. or SODIGA) was a State entity acting on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain and that the dispute came into being after both the Argentine-Spain and the Chile-Spain BITs had entered into force. On these basis, the Tribunal concluded that the Centre had jurisdiction and that the Tribunal was competent to consider the dispute between the parties in accordance with the provisions of the Argentine-Spain BIT.\n\n22.\n\nCertified copies of the Tribunal's decision were distributed to the parties by the Secretary of the Tribunal. A copy of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction is attached to the present Award as an integral part of such.\n\n*2. Procedure leading to the Award on the Merits*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nOn January 25, 2000, the Tribunal, following its Decision on Jurisdiction, issued, in accordance with Rules 19 and 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules of the Centre, Procedural Order No. 3 for the continuation of the proceedings on the merits. In that Procedural Order the Tribunal fixed the following schedule for the further procedures: having the parties filed their principal written pleadings, the Claimant would file a reply on the merits within forty five days from his receipt of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and the Respondent would file a rejoinder on the merits forty-five days from its receipt of the Claimant's reply. Once the Tribunal has received these memorials it would fix a date for a hearing.\n\n24.\n\nPursuant to that schedule, the Claimant submitted to the Centre, on March 21, 2000, his reply on the merits. On May 3, 2000, the Respondent submitted its rejoinder on the merits.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter of May 10, 2000, the Tribunal, having previously consulted with counsel for both parties, called for a hearing on the merits to be held during the week of July 10, 2000, in London, England.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter of June 2, 2000, the Tribunal, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 34(2)(a), call upon the Claimant to produce the following witnesses to be available for examination at the hearing on the merits: Mr. Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini, Mr. Silverio Bouzas Pi\u00f1eiro and Mr. H\u00e9ctor Rodr\u00edguez Molnar.\n\n27.\n\nBy same letter of June 2, 2000, the Tribunal, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 34(2)(a), call upon the Respondent to produce the following witnesses to be available for examination at the hearing on the merits: Mr. Ricardo M\u00e9ndez Rey, Mr. Manuel Mucientes Iglesias, Mr. Luis Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda and Mr. Luis Soto Ba\u00f1os. Additionally, the Tribunal requested that the Respondent make available for examination the following expert: Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez Arnau.\n\n28.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's directions of June 2, 2000, the hearing on the merits would follow this order:\n\nThe Tribunal would deliberate privately on Monday, July 10, 2000.\n\nThe Hearing on the merits would commence on Tuesday, July 11, 2000 at 10 a.m.\n\nCounsel for the Claimant would open with a 30-minute oral presentation, followed by a 30-minute presentation by counsel for the Respondent. Each party may then present, by way of rebuttal and surrebuttal, any further remarks it may have for 15 minutes each.\n\nThe Claimant would then be entitled to a 30-minute examination of each of its witnesses, followed by a 30-minute examination of each of the Claimant's witnesses by counsel for the Respondent. The Respondent would thereafter be entitled to a 30-minute examination of each of its witnesses and of the expert, followed by a 30-minute examination of each of such witnesses and expert by counsel for the Claimant.\n\nFinally the Claimant would close with a statement of no more than 30 minutes, followed by a 30-minute closing statement by the Respondent.\n\nThe members of the Tribunal may put questions to the witnesses and to the expert witness, and ask them for explanations at any moment during the hearings, but such questions would not be chargeable to the parties' time.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter of July 5, 2000, counsel for the Claimant submitted the written deposition of the witness requested from that party, Mr. Silverio Bouzas Pi\u00f1eiro, and an additional deposition made by Mr. Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini.\n\n30.\n\nThe hearing on the merits was held, as scheduled, the week of July 10, 2000, in London, at the seat of the International Dispute Resolution Centre (IDRC). Present at the hearing were:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal:*\n\nProfessor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, President, Judge Thomas Buergenthal, Arbitrator and Mr. Maurice Wolf, Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat:*\n\nMr. Gonzalo Flores, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n*On behalf of the Claimant:*\n\nDr. Ra\u00fal Emilio Vinuesa, Dra. Silvina Gonz\u00e1lez Napolitano and Dra. Gisela Makowski\n\n*On behalf of the Respondent:*\n\nMr. Rafael Le\u00f3n Cavero, Abogado del Estado\n\n*Also attending on behalf of the Respondent:*\n\nMs. Pilar Mor\u00e1n Reyero, Subdirectora General de Inversiones Exteriores del Ministerio de Econom\u00eda del Reino de Espa\u00f1a and Mr. F\u00e9lix Mart\u00ednez Burgos, Consejero Comercial Jefe de la oficina Comercial de Espa\u00f1a en Gran Breta\u00f1a\n\n31.\n\nThe hearing commenced, as scheduled, on July 11, 2000 at 10 a.m. After a brief introduction by the President of the Tribunal, Dr. Ra\u00fal Emilio Vinuesa addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant, referring to the arguments put forward in his written pleadings. Mr. Rafael Andr\u00e9s Le\u00f3n Cavero then addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain.\n\n32.\n\nOf the witnesses requested by the Tribunal from the Claimant only Mr. Rodriguez Molnar appeared at the hearing. As noted in paragraph 29 above, Messrs. Maffezini and Bouzas Pi\u00f1eiro submitted written deposition to the Centre on July 5, 2000. Of the witnesses requested by the Tribunal from the Respondent, Mr. Mendez Rey, Mr. Mucientes Iglesias, Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda and Mr. Soto Ba\u00f1os appeared at the hearing. So did the expert requested by the Tribunal from the Respondent, Mr. \u00c1lvarez Arnau.\n\n33.\n\nThe hearing was suspended on the afternoon of July 11, 2000, during the Claimant's interrogation of the expert, due to a health emergency suffered by Mr. Wolf. The parties having agreed during the August 21, 1998 session of the Tribunal with the parties, that only the presence of the majority of the members of the Tribunal would be required at its sittings, the other members of the Tribunal, with the agreement of the parties, decided to continue with the hearing. The hearing continued thus, in the absence of Mr. Wolf and the Secretary of the Tribunal, who left the hearing to help Mr. Wolf. Even though part of the witnesses' depositions of the afternoon of July 11, 2000 were not recorded due to a technical mishap, which was made known to both of the parties, the recordings were subsequently made available to Mr. Wolf and the other arbitrators, so that all members of the Tribunal had access to most of the testimony presented by the witnesses and the expert. All of the witnesses and the expert that attend the hearing were examined by the presenting party, cross examined by the other party and questioned by the Tribunal. The examination, crossexamination and questioning of all of the witnesses took place during the session of July 11, 2000.\n\n34.\n\nThe hearing continued on the morning of July 12, 2000. Mr. Wolf could not attend this session due to ill health. During this session, counsel for both parties made their closing presentations, as scheduled. The hearing concluded with some final remarks by the President of the Tribunal concerning the efficient and professional presentation of their cases made by counsel for both parties.\n\n35.\n\nOn November 9, 2000, the members of the Tribunal met for the last time at the seat of the Centre, in Washington, D.C., for final deliberations.\n\n*3. Declaration of Closure of the Proceeding*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 38 (1) requires that when the presentation of the case by the Parties is complete, the proceeding shall be declared closed.\n\n37.\n\nHaving reviewed all of the presentations by the parties, the Tribunal, came to the conclusion that there is no request by a Party or any reason to reopen the proceeding, as is possible under ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(2).\n\n38.\n\nAccordingly, by letter dated November 2, 2000, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**C. Summary of Facts and Contentions**\n---------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nIn 1989, Mr. Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini decided to embark on the production of various chemical products in Galicia, Spain, by establishing and investing in a corporation named Emilio A. Maffezini S. A. (EAMSA). EAMSA was incorporated under the laws of Spain on November 15, 1989. Mr. Maffezini subscribed to 70% of the capital for 35 million Spanish Pesetas, paying 66.36% thereof at the time of incorporation, with the balance to be paid at a later time. The *Sociedad para el Desarrollo Industrial de Galicia*, a Spanish entity whose legal status will be discussed below, subscribed to 30% of the capital or 15 million Spanish Pesetas. A third nominal shareholder was included to comply with the legal requirements relating to the incorporation, but that share was immediately repurchased by Mr. Maffezini. A contract was also made for the repurchase of SODIGA's shares by Mr. Maffezini. This contract provided for an interest rate of 12%. That rate was lower than the current market rate of 16.6% and reflected a preferential arrangement. SODIGA also granted a loan of 40 million Spanish Pesetas to the newly incorporated company, at a preferential interest rate, to be applicable at least for the first year. Various subsidies were requested from and approved by the Spanish Ministry of Finance and the *Xunta de Galicia*.\n\n40.\n\nInformation on prospective markets was requested from various Spanish government agencies. At the same time, EAMSA proceeded to hire a private consulting firm in order to identify the appropriate plot of land to buy and to undertake a study on the costs of construction and whatever other requirements the new company might have to begin production. On the basis of this study the land was purchased and contracts concluded with various firms and suppliers. SODIGA, for its part, had also undertaken an economic evaluation of the project in order to decide whether to participate in it.\n\n41.\n\nOn June 24, 1991, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) study was filed with the *Xunta de Galicia*, the government of the Autonomous Region of Galicia. Additional information was requested and provided, and the EIA was finally cleared on January 15, 1992. Before such clearance was obtained, work commenced on readying the land for construction. Construction of the plant itself was also begun.\n\n42.\n\nWhile these preparations for the implementation of the project were in progress, EAMSA began to experience financial difficulties. A capital increase was agreed to, new loans were requested and applications for additional subsidies were made. Some of these efforts did not succeed, however. A transfer of 30 million Spanish Pesetas was made from a personal account of Mr. Maffezini to EAMSA, under circumstances that will be considered below.\n\n43.\n\nIn early March 1992, Mr. Maffezini ordered the construction to stop and the dismissal of EAMSA employees. In June 1994 an attorney working for Mr. Maffezini approached SODIGA with an offer inviting it to cancel all outstanding debts owed it by EAMSA and Mr. Maffezini in exchange for EAMSA's assets. SODIGA indicated that it would accept this offer provided Mr. Maffezini was willing to add 2 million Spanish Pesetas. This proposal was rejected by Mr. Maffezini. The Argentine embassy in Madrid was then asked by Mr. Maffezini to intervene. After an exchange of more correspondence, SODIGA indicated, on June 13, 1996, that it was willing to accept the original proposal made by Mr. Maffezini's attorney. Mr. Maffezini did not follow up on SODIGA's latest proposal. Not long thereafter he instituted the ICSID proceedings described above.\n\n44.\n\nBased on the foregoing facts, Mr. Maffezini has submitted four main contentions to this Tribunal. First, that because of SODIGA's status as a public entity, all of its acts and omissions are attributable to the Kingdom of Spain. Second, that the project failed because of the wrong advice given by SODIGA with regard to the costs of the project, which turned out to be significantly higher than originally estimated. Third, that SODIGA was also responsible for the additional costs resulting from the EIA since EAMSA was pressured to make the investment before the EIA process was finalized and before its implications were known. Fourth, that Mr. Maffezini had not agreed to a loan to EAMSA for 30 million Spanish Pesetas and that the transfer of this amount from his personal account to EAMSA was irregular.\n\n45.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain has contested these allegations. It considers that SODIGA is a private company whose acts are not attributable to the State. In any event, the Kingdom contends that the one year statute of limitation applicable under Spanish law to such claims against public entities bars the instant action even if SODIGA were to be considered a public entity. Spain also argues that Mr. Maffezini was responsible for the feasibility study of the project, including availability of markets for its products and costs, and that SODIGA's studies and estimates were intended purely for its own purposes in order to enable it to decide whether to participate in the venture. The Kingdom of Spain further argues that Mr. Maffezini was fully aware of the requirements of the EIA and that he decided to acquire the land and proceed with the construction before receiving EIA approval and did so against the advice of his own employees and consultants. According to Spain, the transfer of funds to EAMSA was fully authorized by Mr. Maffezini and was carried out by an official of SODIGA acting in his personal capacity on instructions of Mr. Maffezini. The Kingdom also considers that, as a matter of law, Mr. Maffezini's 1994 settlement proposal was an offer to conclude a contract. That offer was never withdrawn and, therefore, became a binding contract when SODIGA accepted it in 1996.\n\n**D. Considerations**\n---------------------\n\n*SODIGA's status in the Kingdom of Spain.*\n------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe status of SODIGA in the Kingdom of Spain was considered by the Tribunal at the jurisdictional stage of these proceedings from two points of view. The Tribunal first considered whether or not SODIGA was a State entity for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal. Here the Tribunal found that the Claimant had made out a *prima facie* case that SODIGA was a State entity acting on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain. Both a structural and a functional test were applied to reach this conclusion.\n\n47.\n\nThis *prima facie* determination can now be confirmed by the Tribunal since no convincing evidence has been produced to rebut it. The Kingdom of Spain has continuously relied on the structure of the Spanish public administration to argue that SODIGA did not fall in this category and that it is merely a financial company created as a private corporation. Among other arguments in support of this position, the Kingdom of Spain invoked Article 2 of Law 30/92, dated November 27, 1992, which establishes the legal regime of Public Administrations and Common Administrative Procedure.4 This provision identifies as public administrations the General Administration of the State, the Administration of Autonomous Communities and the entities belonging to local administrations. It further identifies in this category the entities created under public law and that have a legal personality associated with any of the entities mentioned. This listing is consistent with the structural test employed by the Spanish Administration.\n\nLaw No. 30/1992, November 26, 1992, as amended, text in Luis Mart\u00edn Rebollo: *Leyes Administrativas*, 1999, at 369.\n\n48.\n\nBut even if the structural test is applied, it is clear that financial companies such as SODIGA could not at the period relevant to the present dispute be held to fall entirely outside the overall scheme of public administration. In fact, there existed a variety of public entities that were governed by private law but which would occasionally exercise public functions that were governed by public law.5 Thus, the *Instituto Nacional de Industria*, established in 1941, followed in 1992 by the Group *TENEO S. A.,* both with close institutional and financial relations to SODIGA, as well as the creation in 1995 of the State Corporation for Industrial Participation (\"Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales\"), were all in this mixed category of public entities with private law regimes.6 Their status always gave rise to great confusion.7\n\nLuis Mart\u00edn Rebollo: \"Estudio Preliminar y Esquema de la Organizaci\u00f3n de la Administraci\u00f3n General del Estado y de la Estructura Org\u00e1nica B\u00e1sica de los diferentes Ministerios\", in op. cit., supra note 4, 636, 639.\n\nIbid., at 639-640.\n\nIbid., at 679.\n\n49.\n\nThe enactment of Law 30/92 clarified this situation in part. It must be noted, however, that this law is of a date subsequent to the here relevant period\u2014November 27, 1992. Gradually the distinction came to be made between Public Business Entities (\"Entidades p\u00fablicas empresariales\") which, although governed by private law, could eventually exercise some public functions under public law,8 and State commercial corporations (\"Sociedades mercantiles estatales\"). The latter, although considered public entities from an economic point of view, are as a matter of law governed by private law, and not administrative law.9 But even here some activities of these commercial corporations, such as contracting for example, were governed by administrative law.10 It was not until the adoption of Law 6/ 1997 of April 14, 1997 that state commercial corporations were clearly forbidden to \"perform functions that imply the exercise of public authority.\"11 The regime only came to be completed recently with the enactment of Law 1/1999, dated January 5, 1999, which governs capital venture entities and the corporations established to manage such entities, including \"XesGALICIA S.G.E.C.R., S.A,\" established in 1999, the present corporation that now controls SODIGA.12\n\nSee in particular Article 2.2 of Law No. 30/1992, and the notes to this Article by Mart\u00edn Rebollo, op. cit. supra note 4, at 385.\n\nMart\u00edn Rebollo, op. cit., supra note 4, at 679.\n\nIbid., at 679\n\nLaw No. 6/1997, April 14, 1997, in Mart\u00edn Rebollo, op. cit., supra note 4, at 677, Disposici\u00f3n Adicional Duod\u00e9cima, at 713.\n\nJos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Pell\u00f3n: *El capital inversi\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a1999*, Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Capital Inversi\u00f3n, 1999, at 24. For a description of \"XesGalicia S. G. E. C. R., S. A.\", see Ibid., at 197.\n\n50.\n\nThe structural test, however, is but one element to be taken into account. Other elements to which international law looks are, in particular, the control of the company by the State or State entities and the objectives and functions for which the company was created. As the Tribunal emphasized in its Decision on jurisdiction, many of these elements point in the instant case to its public nature.\n\n51.\n\nThe second issue the Tribunal considered at the jurisdictional stage was whether the actions and omissions complained of by the Claimant were attributable to the State. In dealing with this question, the Tribunal concluded that whether SODIGA was responsible for those acts, whether they were wrongful, whether all these acts and omissions always were governmental rather than commercial in nature, and, hence, whether they can be attributed to the Spanish State, were all issues that could only be decided at the merits stage of the case.\n\n52.\n\nIn dealing with these questions, the Tribunal must again rely on the functional test, that is, it must establish whether specific acts or omissions are essentially commercial rather than governmental in nature or, conversely, whether their nature is essentially governmental rather than commercial. Commercial acts cannot be attributed to the Spanish State, while governmental acts should be so attributed.\n\n53.\n\nSODIGA was incorporated in 1972 at a time when the Spanish State pursued an active policy of industrial promotion, particularly in depressed areas of the country. This policy was specifically designed by the public sector to encourage the industrial development of Spain. To this end not less than twenty-two such entities were created in different regions of the country. Only four such entities were related to the private sector. All others, including SODIGA, were closely related to the *Instituto Nacional de* *Industria\\_and* to the respective *Comunidades Autonomas* which, in the case of SODIGA, was the *Xunta de Galicia*.13\n\nIbid., at 39-40.\n\n54.\n\nJust as in the case of EAMSA, the policy pursued by these entities was implemented by investing in newly created companies, by the grant of loans and the conclusion of contracts for the repurchase of shares, which in a sense also amounted to a deferred loan. Most of these ventures were not quite successful from a financial point of view, although they contributed to the development of the industrial and business base of the region concerned. Important shortcomings that have been identified in this policy were the lack of a specific legal and fiscal framework, difficulties in recovering the investments made and the lack of professional expertise. These shortcomings were aggravated by political pressures to support investments of doubtful viability.14\n\nIbid., at 40.\n\n55.\n\nBecause of the problems that were encountered under the original approach, the entities here in question embarked on a reorientation of their functions. Beginning in the late 1980's, they started to adopt a more business-oriented approach, particularly in order to be able to confront the growing competition from European financial institutions that came to Spain following its incorporation into the European Economic Community. As a result of this new orientation, investments in newly formed companies diminished significantly. Later the number of companies in which investments were made also diminished, and capital was invested in consolidated companies, generally by means of leveraged buy-outs, management buyouts or management buy-ins.15 At the same time, small investments gradually diminished. They were replaced by larger volume investments in each operation and company.\n\nIbid., at 45-46.\n\n56.\n\nThe end result of this reorientation was that in the 1990's these entities became active participants in a flourishing market economy. A number of investment projects were discontinued and some recovery of capital took place, either directly or by means of the sale of shares in the stock market.16 A Spanish Association of Investment Capital, formerly the Spanish Association of Capital-Risk Entities, was created in 1986. It and the corresponding association of comparable European entities, in which SODIGA also participated, have been instrumental in bringing about this transformation. Some of the changes and resulting developments were most helpfully explained to the Tribunal by the President of SODIGA and now President of \"XesGALICIA S.G.E.C.R., S.A.\", Mr. Luis Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, during the oral hearings in these proceedings.\n\nIbid., at 30-31.\n\n57.\n\nAt the time EAMSA was established, SODIGA was in the process of transforming itself from a State-oriented to a market-oriented entity. While originally a number of SODIGA's functions were closer to being governmental in nature, they must today be considered commercial in nature. But at the time of transition, there was in fact a combination of both, some to be regarded as functions essentially governmental in nature and others essentially commercial in character. As mentioned above, this is the dividing line between those acts or omissions that can be attributed to the Spanish State and those that cannot. The Tribunal must accordingly categorize the various acts or omissions giving rise to the instant dispute.\n\n*Responsibility for mistaken advice.*\n-------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe second main contention by the Claimant, as noted above, is that the project failed because SODIGA provided faulty advice regarding the cost of the project, which turned out to be significantly higher than originally estimated. According to the Claimant, the first draft investment project was based on a report by SODIGA, dated May 1989, which was made in order to determine the viability of the project. Claimant submits that the final cost of the investment would have been 300% higher had the project been completed.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal has already noted that Spain rejected this contention. It argued that Mr. Maffezini was responsible for the commissioning of a feasibility study for the project, and that SODIGA's estimates were designed solely for its own internal purposes to enable it to decide whether to participate in the new company. Spain also submitted that the investor was an experienced businessman and that he and his team of professionals prepared the project. SODIGA's advice was never requested and EAMSA was not induced to invest. Furthermore, the technical study regarding costs was prepared at the request of EAMSA by a consulting firm\u2014COTECNO. Spain contended, furthermore, that the increased cost amounted to no more than 21% and that it was due to specification changes ordered by Mr. Maffezini. According to Spain, once the increase in cost attributable to the changed specifications is deducted from the original estimate, the cost per square meter constructed does not differ significantly from the estimated figure.\n\n60.\n\nAccording to Spain, what really went wrong was that the project was ill conceived. No market studies were undertaken, Spain's public services provided free information but were not supposed to provide professional advice, the plot of land was not appropriately examined and required additional work, and the specifications were changed with regard to both the quality and quantity of the construction that had been envisaged. Mr. Maffezini was responsible for all these problems, and it was he who eventually decided to stop the work and dismiss all EAMSA's employees.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully examined all of these contentions. In doing so, it has taken account of the fact that one of the functions of SODIGA and her sister institutions in Spain was to provide information to investors and businessmen in order to promote the industrialization of the region concerned. In this connection, it is apparent that SODIGA did more than merely provide EAMSA with information. It made available to EAMSA a number of other services. SODIGA provided EAMSA with office space during the start-up period and accounting services that included assistance with the disbursement for the payment of bills and other expenditures. There was, as a result, considerable interaction between SODIGA's officials and EAMSA employees, in the course of which the project, its costs and returns, and the viability and prospects of the proposed investment were explored by them at some length.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied, however, that SODIGA was not discharging any public functions in providing the aforesaid information assistance to EAMSA. This type of activity does not ordinarily go beyond the commercial assistance that many financial and commercial entities provide to their prospective customers. Some of the other services provided, however, do have a connection with other aspects of the claim.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied, after hearing expert and witness testimony on these issues, that the feasibility study made by SODIGA, whether faulty or not, was intended solely for SODIGA's internal purposes of deciding on its own participation in the capital of EAMSA and that it was not intended to serve as a substitute for the study the investor commissioned by hiring COTECNO. Hence, SODIGA cannot be held responsible for cost overruns, whatever their real amount might have been. Moreover, SODIGA's membership on the board of EAMSA, an aspect that has also been raised by the claimant so as to justify an attribution of responsibility in this connection, was also consistent with normal business arrangements. Subsidies were granted by the Spanish State and the **Xunta de Galicia** at the request of EAMSA and not by SODIGA, thus neither providing a link to potential attribution of responsibility to the latter. Even the preferential rates applied to SODIGA's loans were paid for by the **Xunta de Galicia** by way of reimbursement.\n\n64.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal must emphasize that Bilateral Investment Treaties are not insurance policies against bad business judgments. While it is probably true that there were shortcomings in the policies and practices that SODIGA and its sister entities pursued in the here relevant period in Spain, they cannot be deemed to relieve investors of the business risks inherent in any investment. To that extent, it is clear that Spain cannot be held responsible for the losses Mr. Maffezini may have sustained any more than would any private entity under similar circumstances.\n\n*Responsibility for Environmental Impact Assessment.*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that SODIGA is responsible for the additional costs resulting from the EIA because EAMSA was pressured to go ahead with the investment before that process was finalized and its implications were known. This pressure, according to Claimant, was exercised for political reasons by the authorities of the *Xunta de Galicia* and the local municipality. Claimant's decision to stop the construction work was directly related to this additional increase in the costs of the project.\n\n66.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain is of the view that Mr. Maffezini was fully aware of the requirements of the EIA and decided to acquire the land and proceed with the construction before its approval, and that he did so against the advice of his own employees and consultants. The Claimant was specifically informed of the applicable legal requirements in Spain and under the European Economic Community, particularly as the project involved the highly toxic chemical industry. The initial EIA study prepared by EAMSA was insufficient and the *Xunta de Galicia* had to request supplemental information. Once this information was submitted, the approval of the EIA proceeded expeditiously. No pressure was applied on EAMSA and the decision to discontinue the project was entirely unrelated to the EIA.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully examined these contentions, since the Environmental Impact Assessment procedure is basic for the adequate protection of the environment and the application of appropriate preventive measures. This is true, not only under Spanish and EEC law, but also increasingly so under international law.17\n\nSee for example the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context, Espoo, February 25, 1991, and see generally Philippe Sands: *Principles of International Environmental Law*, Vol. 1, 1995, Chapter 15: \"Environmental Impact Assessment\", 579-595.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in Spain there is a Constitutional mandate relating to the protection of the environment, which finds expression in Article 45 of the Constitution of 1978.18 Paragraph 2 of this Article states that \"[t]he public authorities, relying on the necessary public solidarity, shall ensure that all natural resources are used rationally, with a view to safeguarding and improving the quality of life and protecting and restoring the environment.\"19 This mandate applies not only to the General Administration of the State but also to the Autonomous Communities and Municipalities.20 Specific legislation has been enacted to fulfill this mandate, including the Law on Toxic and Hazardous Waste21 and other instruments.22\n\nConstituci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, December 27, 1978, *Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado*, No. 311.

Spain*, Case No. 41/1993/436/515, December 9, 1994, paragraph 23.\n\nRam\u00f3n Mart\u00edn Mateo: \"The Environmental Law System\", in N. S. J. Koeman: *Environmental Law in Europe*, 1999, Chapter 15: \"Environmental Law in Spain\", 497, at 497-499.\n\nLaw No. 20, May 14, 1986, as discussed in Mart\u00edn Mateo, loc. cit., supra note 20, at 504.\n\nOn the Spanish environmental legislation see generally Mart\u00edn Mateo, loc. cit., supra note 20, and Carlos de Miguel Perales: \"Practical Questions of Environmental Law\", in Koeman, op. cit. and chapter cit., supra note 20, 508.\n\n69.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is the legislation on EIA. Strict procedures in this respect are provided in EEC Directive 85/337 of June 27, 198523 and in Spain's Royal Legislative Decree No. 1302/1986 of June 28, 1986.24 Chemical industries are specifically required under both measures to undertake an EIA. Public information, consultation with pertinent authorities, licensing and other procedures are also a part thereof.25 The EEC Directive, like the one that later came to amend it,26 requires \"that an EIA is undertaken before consent is given to certain public and private projects considered to have significant environmental implications.\"27 Suspension of projects can be ordered under Spanish law, particularly if work thereon is begun before the EIA is approved.28\n\nEEC Directive 85/337, June 27, 1985, *Official Journal of the European Community,* No. L175/40, July 5, 1985.\n\nReal Decreto Legislativo No. 1302/1986, June 28, 1986, *Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado,* No. 155, June 30, 1986, 23733.\n\nDe Miguel Perales, loc. cit., supra note 22, at 508-511.\n\nEEC Directive 97/11, *Official Journal of the European Community,* L73/5, 1997.\n\nLaurens Jan Brinkhorst: \"European Environmental Law: an Introduction\", in Koeman, op. cit., supra note 20, 1, at 15.\n\nDecree No. 1302, cit., supra note 24, Article 9. 1.\n\n70.\n\nThere can be no doubt that EAMSA's project required an EIA and that both Mr. Maffezini and his employees were aware that this was so. The record is abundantly clear with regard to the exchange of correspondence and other communications on the issue of environmental requirements. Apart from the general principle that ignorance of the law is no defense, there is evidence in this case that the Claimant was informed of these requirements. That was why COTECNO was also asked to prepare the initial EIA study as part of its broader study on costs. It appears to the Tribunal that the investor, as happens so often, tried to minimize this requirement so as to avoid additional costs or technical difficulties. Moreover, the Claimant has also not substantiated, much less proved, the costs or damages attributable to the handling of the EIA by the Spanish authorities.\n\n71.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain and SODIGA have done no more in this respect than insist on the strict observance of the EEC and Spanish law applicable to the industry in question. It follows that Spain cannot be held responsible for the decisions taken by the Claimant with regard to the EIA. Furthermore, the Kingdom of Spain's action is fully consistent with Article 2(1) of the Argentine-Spain Bilateral Investment Treaty, which calls for the promotion of investment in compliance with national legislation. The Tribunal accordingly also dismisses this contention by the Claimant.\n\n*The transfer of funds.*\n------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that 30 million Spanish Pesetas were transferred from his personal account as a loan to EAMSA, despite the fact that he had not consented to the loan. The Claimant also complains of a number of irregularities attributable to the private banks that managed his accounts, and that these acts also engage the responsibility of the *Banco de Espa\u00f1a*, Spain's Central Bank.\n\n73.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain denies these allegations on the grounds that Mr. Maffezini had consented to the loan, had authorized the transfer of funds and had mandated Mr. Luis Soto Ba\u00f1os, SODIGA's representative in EAMSA, to undertake these operations. Since Mr. Soto Ba\u00f1os was for these purposes acting as the personal representative of Mr. Maffezini, Spain submits that his acts cannot be attributed to SODIGA. Moreover, according to Spain, alleged irregularities on the part of private banks are not the responsibility of the *Banco de Espa\u00f1a* nor of the Spanish State. Besides, Spanish courts are open to decide on any complaints Mr. Maffezini might have against these banks.\n\n74.\n\nIn late 1991, when EAMSA was experiencing financial difficulties, discussions were held on how to overcome these problems. In that context, it appears that Mr. Maffezini offered to make available the amount of 30 million pesetas. It is an established fact that on November 14, 1991, Mr. Maffezini authorized his bank to transfer such an amount to the account of EAMSA whenever requested to do so by Mr. Soto Ba\u00f1os. While it is true that the order was not conditioned on other events, it is clear that at that time neither the terms of the financial arrangements nor the details relating to the eventual loan had been fully negotiated. The specific cash requirements of EAMSA were also not known at the time.\n\n75.\n\nThe order to transfer was given by Mr. Soto Ba\u00f1os on February 4, 1992. The underlying financial commitment, however, never came to be formalized in a contract binding on Mr. Maffezini, nor was the loan approved by the board of EAMSA, either before or after the transfer of the funds. In this respect the Claimant has convincingly made a distinction between the authorization to the transfer of funds, which was indeed given by him, and the translation of that transaction into a contract, which was never concluded or consented by Mr. Maffezini. The transfer authorization was apparently given on the assumption that it would be preceded by a contract, but no such contract was concluded. Mr. Soto Ba\u00f1os' testimony at the oral hearing confirmed that the loan was never formalized. While this kind of financial arrangement is not uncommon in emergency situations, the lack of a prior or later legally binding contract formalizing the transaction compels the conclusion that this *de facto* arrangement cannot be opposed to the Claimant against his consent.\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that Mr. Soto Ba\u00f1os was not acting in this operation as the personal representative of Mr. Maffezini but as an official of SODIGA. The oral hearings confirmed that Mr. Soto Ba\u00f1os discussed the transfer of these funds with the President of SODIGA and that the latter authorized him to proceed as he thought best. Similar authorization was not sought from Mr. Maffezini, even though there was time to do so. This further authorization was necessary since, although Mr. Soto Ba\u00f1os was authorized to transfer the funds, no agreement had been reached on the use to which the funds were to be put and on the terms of the loan. The fact that Mr. Soto Ba\u00f1os failed to consult with Mr. Maffezini, but sought and obtained authorization to act from the President of SODIGA, compels the conclusion that Mr. Soto Ba\u00f1os' action, whether within the terms of the mandate or *ultra vires*, is attributable to SODIGA.\n\n77.\n\nIt must therefore be asked whether that action is purely commercial in nature or whether it was performed in the exercise of SODIGA's public or government functions. In the latter case, it would be attributable to the Spanish State.\n\n78.\n\nIt is here that the public functions of SODIGA, discussed above, acquire special relevance. Because SODIGA was an entity charged with the implementation of governmental policies relating to industrial promotion, it performed a number of functions not normally open to ordinary commercial companies. Handling the accounts of EAMSA as a participating company, managing its payments and finances and generally intervening on its behalf before the Spanish authorities without being paid for these services, are all elements that responded to SODIGA's public nature and responsibility. Moreover, the manner in which the private banks conducted themselves in this case with regard to the loan, can be explained in large measure only because of their recognition that SODIGA's orders and instructions were entitled to be honored because of the public functions it performed in Galicia.\n\n79.\n\nIn addition, it must be noted that although the transfer was labeled a loan, in fact it amounted to an increase of the investment. This explains the inquiries made with the Ministry of Economics about whether the loan should be registered as a part of the investment. The rejoinder by the Kingdom of Spain also describes the investments made by the Claimant as comprising 35 million pesetas as a capital subscription and 30 million as a loan to EAMSA, both being submitted for registration with the Ministry of Economy.29 A decision to increase the investment taken not by Mr. Maffezini but by the entity entrusted by the State to promote the industrialization of Galicia, cannot be considered a commercial activity. Rather, it grew out of the public functions of SODIGA.\n\nMemorial de D\u00faplica del Reino de Espa\u00f1a, May 3, 2000, at 36-37.\n\n80.\n\nWhile it has been argued by Spain that the transfer resulted in the protection of the investment and thus ultimately benefited Mr. Maffezini by strengthening the financial condition of EAMSA, this is not a tenable proposition in view of the fact that the investor himself did not think that these steps were appropriate. Neither the fact that a credit was entered in favor of Mr. Maffezini on EAMSA's accounts, nor the argument that he could at any time recover the 30 million pesetas that had been transferred change the situation since the funds were largely spent and, hence, not really available to Mr. Maffezini.\n\n81.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain has convincingly argued that neither the Spanish State nor the *Banco de Espa\u00f1a* is responsible for the alleged irregularities attributed to the private banks since the Central Bank only has supervising authority over general financial and monetary operation of private banks and not over their relations with clients.\n\n82.\n\nIn accordance with Article 1214 of the Spanish Civil Code the burden of proof of the existence of an obligation rests with him who claims its fulfillment.30 In this case, no written or other proof has been offered regarding the existence of a loan binding on Mr. Maffezini. On the contrary, the evidence presented to the Tribunal indicates that no legal obligation existed with regard to the loan.\n\nC\u00f3digo Civil, Article 1214, and notes by Francisco Javier Fern\u00e1ndez-Urzainqui, 1999, at 318.\n\n83.\n\nBecause the acts of SODIGA relating to the loan cannot be considered commercial in nature and involve its public functions, responsibility for them should be attributed to the Kingdom of Spain. In particular, these acts amounted to a breach by Spain of its obligation to protect the investment as provided for in Article 3(1) of the Argentine-Spain Bilateral Investment Treaty. Moreover, the lack of transparency with which this loan transaction was conducted is incompatible with Spain's commitment to ensure the investor a fair and equitable treatment in accordance with Article 4(1) of the same treaty. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that, with regard to this contention, the Claimant has substantiated his claim and is entitled to compensation in the manner spelled out below.\n\n*Desinvestment negotiations.*\n-----------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal must now examine the question of the desinvestment negotiations that took place in the period 1994-1996 and their meaning. The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that one of the difficult issues arising from the experience of industrial promotion in Spain relates to the desinvestment and recovery of the capital contributions and loans made by the risk-capital entities to the newly created companies.\n\n85.\n\nOn 13 June 1994, a meeting was held between Mr. H\u00e9ctor Rodr\u00edguez Molnar, an attorney working for Mr. Maffezini, and officials of SODIGA. The meeting was specifically requested by the attorney in order to discuss a final settlement of the obligations that both EAMSA and Mr. Maffezini had with SODIGA. As it was later summarized in a letter by SODIGA's President dated June 23, 1994, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez Molnar proposed an arrangement at this meeting that would have had the effect of cancelling all EAMSA's and Mr. Maffezini's obligations in exchange for the assets of EAMSA, amounting to 23,604,168 pesetas. This discussion was confirmed by Mr. Rodr\u00edguez Molnar at the oral hearings of this Tribunal at which he appeared as a witness for the Claimant.\n\n86.\n\nIt has also been demonstrated that SODIGA countered this offer by demanding an additional 2 million pesetas from Mr. Maffezini. This proposal was rejected by Mr. Maffezini. After the first demarches by the Argentine embassy in Madrid, SODIGA's President wrote to Mr. Maffezini on June 13, 1996, stating that in the spirit of reaching an amicable solution SODIGA was prepared to accept the settlement discussed two years earlier with Mr. Rodriguez Molnar, that is, SODIGA waived payment of the additional 2 million pesetas. At this time, however, Mr. Maffezini was already embarked on preparations to submit the matter to ICSID, and the settlement negotiations were not pursued further.\n\n87.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain has argued that the proposal made by Mr. Rodr\u00edguez Molnar in 1994 constitutes an offer that was never withdrawn, and that its acceptance by SODIGA two years later resulted in a legally binding contract which the Claimant could not now ignore. In Spain's view, this desinvestment settlement was the only question that could be brought before this Tribunal.\n\n88.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that at the time these negotiations were taking place, the parties did not believe that they were concluding a contract. Instead, the evidence suggests that they assumed that they were engaging in negotiations that might produce an eventual settlement. Negotiation with banks and financial entities are commonly resorted to in order to resolve questions concerning the payment of loans, capital contributions and other aspects of a business; in essence, these are negotiations designed to reach agreement on the amounts involved. The President of SODIGA confirmed this understanding in his letter of June 13, 1996, when he stated that SODIGA was prepared to settle \"in terms similar to the negotiations undertaken at its time with Mr. Rodr\u00edguez Molnar.\" There is no reference to any contract or its finalization by this acceptance.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal has also examined this matter from the point of view of Spanish law. Article 1262 of the Spanish Civil Code simply provides that \"Consent is expressed by the concurrence of the offer on the object and cause that will constitute the contract and its acceptance.\"31 Article 54 of the Spanish Commercial Code elaborates the point further by providing that \"Contracts made by correspondence shall be perfected when there is a reply accepting the offer or the conditions with which the offer was modi-fied.\"32 These provisions assume that there was an intention to make an offer with a view to concluding a contract, which was not true of the negotiations described above. Here it is not relevant that the original \"offer\" was not withdrawn.\n\nC\u00f3digo Civil, Article 1262, and notes by Fern\u00e1ndez-Urzainqui, cit., supra note 30, at 327. See in particular Manuel Albaladejo: *Derecho Civil*, II, Vol. 1, Tenth edition, 1997, at 374375, with reference to a judicial decision of December 14, 1964, relating the offer and acceptance to the intention of producing legal effects.\n\nC\u00f3digo de Comercio, Article 54.\n\n90.\n\nEven if the offer was likely to lead to the conclusion of the contract, its acceptance would have to be unconditional. A conditional acceptance amounts to a counter-offer that must be accepted by the original offeror.33 SODIGA's acceptance was conditioned on the payment of an additional 2 million pesetas and was thus a counter-offer. It was expressly rejected by Mr. Maffezini. From a legal point of view then the original offer lapsed and there was no consent, no contract and no liability. Moreover, the letter from SODIGA's President of June 13, 1996 cannot consequently be considered an acceptance of the original offer. It was a new offer in similar terms that would require Mr. Maffezini's acceptance, which he did not give. It is well established under the Spanish Civil Code and the writing of eminent commentators that courts may treat an offer as withdrawn or lapsed if acceptance is not timely, that is, when it does not take place within a reasonable period of time.34 Hence, even if one were to assume, *arguendo,* that there had been offer, its acceptance two years later would certainly not be timely.\n\nAlbaladejo, op. cit., supra note 31, at 385, describing the counter-offer as a second offer that follows the rejection of the first and with reference to a judicial decision of March 14, 1973.\n\nSee, for example, Calixto Valverde y Valverde: **Tratado de Derecho Civil Espa\u00f1ol**, 1926, at 241, with reference to a judicial decision of October 2, 1867. This author comments in particular: \"Estimamos tambi\u00e9n, que de si las circunstancias se dedujere que ha transcurrido con exceso un plazo prudencial para que el aceptante haya podido recoger la oferta, los tribunales podr\u00e1n considerar en ese caso retirada, o mejor dicho, caducada la oferta\", at 241. See also Federico Puig Pe\u00f1a: **Tratado de Derecho Civil Espa\u00f1ol**, Tomo IV, Vol. II, 1951, at 53 and Albaladejo, op. cit., supra note 31, at 390 with reference to the circumstances of the case and the nature of the matter.\n\n91.\n\nIt follows from what has been said above that no contract was concluded regarding the desinvestment and that neither party had assumed a legally binding commitment with regard thereto.\n\n*Limitation period.*\n--------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain has also argued that even if it were found to have incurred some liability in this case, the claim against it was barred by a one-year statute of limitation that applies to claims for compensatory damages against the State, as provided in Article 142.2 of Law 30/92.\n\n93.\n\nAlthough it is true that this statute of limitation exists, it cannot apply to claims filed under the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Compensation and interest.*\n----------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question of compensation for the claim that has been upheld.\n\n95.\n\nThe parties have not disputed the sum that was transferred, which amounts to 30 million Spanish Pesetas.\n\n96.\n\nThis sum is subject to the payment of interest. Since the funds were withdrawn from a time-deposit account of Mr. Maffezini, it is appropriate in this case to order the payment of interest compounded on an annual basis from February 4, 1992 until the date of the Award. The Tribunal considers reasonable to fix as interest rate the LIBOR rate for the Spanish peseta for each annual period since February 4, 1992 and for the proportion that corresponds to the period between February 4, 2000 and the date of the Award.35 The interests therefore amount to ESP 27,641,265.28 (twenty-seven million six hundred forty one thousand two hundred and sixty-five Spanish pesetas and 28 cents).\n\nIn accordance with British Bankers Association Financial Data.\n\n97.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the total amount of compensation, including interest, that the Kingdom of Spain is to pay the Claimant is ESP 57,641,265.28 (fifty-seven million six hundred forty one thousand two hundred and sixty-five Spanish pesetas and 28 cents). The Kingdom of Spain shall make such payment within a period of 60 days as of the date of this Award. Should the payment of this amount not be made within the period specified above, the amount shall accrue interests at a rate of 6% per annum, compounded monthly, as of the date of the Award to the date of payment.\n\n98.\n\nAs for the expenses incurred in these proceedings, including the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, it holds that these institutional expenses shall be borne equally by the parties.\n\n99.\n\nAs for the expenses and legal costs of counsel for the parties, the Tribunal decides that each party shall bear the entirety of its own expenses and legal fees for its own counsel, considering that each party has been successful on the key points of their respective positions.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal expresses its appreciation to counsel for both parties, distinguished Argentine and Spanish lawyers, for the outstanding professionalism and cooperation which they demonstrated in this case.\n\n**E. Decisions**\n----------------\n\nFor the reasons stated above the Tribunal unanimously decides that:\n\n(1) The Kingdom of Spain shall pay the Claimant the amount of ESP 57,641,265.28 (fifty-seven million six hundred forty one thousand two hundred and sixty-five Spanish pesetas and 28 cents).\n\n(2) Each of the parties shall bear the entirety of its own expenses and legal fees for its own counsel.\n\n(3) All other claims are dismissed.\n\nSo Decided."}, {"Title": "Rectification of the Award", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2001-01-31T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Rectification of the Award\n--------------------------\n\n*Procedure Leading to the Rectification of the Award*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn November 13, 2000, the Arbitral Tribunal constituted in this case rendered its Award. On the same date, and in accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), the Acting Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) dispatched a certified copy of the Award to Mr. Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini (the Claimant) and to the Kingdom of Spain (the Respondent), indicating the date of dispatch on the original text and on all copies.\n\n2.\n\nOn December 13, 2000, the Kingdom of Spain submitted to the Secretary-General a request for rectification of the Award in accordance with Article 49(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention) and Arbitration Rule 49.\n\n3.\n\nOn December 27, 2000, the Kingdom of Spain submitted to the Centre the lodging fee for the rectification of an Award prescribed in Arbitration Rule 49(1)(d).\n\n4.\n\nOn January 2, 2001, the Acting Secretary-General, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 49(2), registered the request for rectification of the Award submitted by the Kingdom of Spain and, on the same day, notified the parties of the registration, transmitted to the Claimant a copy of the request for rectification and transmitted to each member of the Tribunal a copy of the notice of registration, together with a copy of the request.\n\n5.\n\nOn January 4, 2001, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 49(3), the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the parties of the Tribunal's decision that it would not be necessary for the Tribunal to meet in order to consider the request for rectification of the Award. The Secretary of the Tribunal also communicated to the parties the time limits for the parties' filing of their observations on the request and the proceeding to be followed for the consideration of the request.\n\n6.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule set by the Tribunal, the Claimant, on January 9, 2001, announced that he did not have observations to file with respect to the request for rectification of the Award submitted by the Kingdom of Spain. The Kingdom of Spain did not file any additional observations on the request for rectification of the Award.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal, by means of telephone communication and mail correspondence, deliberated on the request for rectification of the Award submitted by the Kingdom of Spain, unanimously reaching the present decision.\n\n*Summary of the request for rectification submitted by the Kingdom of Spain*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain, in its request for rectification of the Award has asked that the word \"official\" used in line 14 (line 13 in the English version of the Award) of paragraph 45 of the Award be substituted by \"employee.\"\n\n9.\n\nSaid request for rectification is based on the Kingdom of Spain's conviction \"that due to a transcription error, it is affirmed in the Award that the Kingdom of Spain recognizes in its allegations that the employees of SODIGA were 'officials', which is exactly the contrary of what it has alleged and defended in its arguments.\"\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent likewise states that \"in a sufficiently precise and documented manner, the Kingdom of Spain has presented the legal distinction between employee and official, defending in its allegations that the employees of SODIGA were not officials from a legal standpoint, but rather employees within the framework of labor law. [...] It is therefore not possible to impute to Spain recognition of the official status of an employee which has never been made.\"\n\n11.\n\nIn support of said affirmations, the Kingdom of Spain cites its counter-memorial of April 9, 1999, in which it states, on page 91, \"But it is that in addition, [...] **its employees (sic. Those of SODIGA S.A.) are not officials** whose services are regulated by the standard for Spanish public officials. What is involved is a corporation regulated by Spanish commercial private law, which is subject to judgment before Spanish civil courts and whose **workers are employees,** bind to their employer under a relationship regulated by Spanish labor laws.\" (emphasis and clarification in parenthesis in the original request for rectification).\n\n12.\n\nAs a consequence, the Kingdom of Spain sustains that \"that which most conforms with what has been truly alleged by Spain, whose legal position is intended to be summarized in section 45 of the award [\u2026] is the following: 'According to Spain, the transfer of funds to EAMSA was fully authorized by Mr. Maffezini and was carried out by an employee of SODIGA acting in his personal capacity...'\" (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Considerations*\n----------------\n\n13.\n\nArticle 49(2) of the ICSID Convention establishes that \"The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award.\"\n\n14.\n\nArbitration Rule 49 supplements that which is stated in the above-mentioned paragraph, establishing that \"within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered, either party may request, pursuant to Article 49(2) of the Convention, a supplementary decision on, or rectification of, the award,\" with the requirement that the request, among other requisites, \"state in detail any error in the award which the requesting party seeks to have rectified.\"\n\n15.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain filed its request for rectification of the Award on December 13, 2000, and submitted its fee for lodging a request for rectification, as prescribed by Arbitration Rule 49(1)(d), on December 27, 2000, that is, within 45 after the date on which the Award was rendered.\n\n16.\n\nParagraph 45 of the Award dated November 13, 2000 forms part of section C of said Award, entitled *Summary of Facts and Contentions*. In said paragraph 45, the Arbitral Tribunal described the arguments presented by the Kingdom of Spain in its oral and written pleadings.\n\n17.\n\nThe rectification requested by the Kingdom of Spain appropriately summarizes the arguments set forth by the Respondent in the present proceeding.\n\n18.\n\nThe request of the Kingdom of Spain seeks, as a consequence, the rectification of a material error in the Award of November 13, 2000, as prescribed by Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n19.\n\nHaving received no objections from the Claimant, and in view of the modification of the summary of arguments by the Respondent as set forth by the Respondent itself, this Tribunal finds it appropriate to grant the request for rectification of the Award filed by the Kingdom of Spain.\n\n20.\n\nFor the purpose of Arbitration Rule 49(4) the present decision refers to the terms of the Award dated November 13, 2000, relating to the matters indicated in Arbitration Rule 47(1)(a-g). In accordance with Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the present decision constitutes an integral part of the Award.\n\n*Decision*\n----------\n\n21.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal unanimously decides:\n\n(1) To grant the request for rectification of the Award submitted by the Kingdom of Spain on December 13, 2000, thereby substituting in line 14 (13 in the English version of the Award) of paragraph 45 of the Award the word \"employee\" for the word \"official.\"\n\n(2) Each of the parties shall bear the entirety of the costs of its own expenses and legal fees for its own counsel resulting from the present rectification proceeding."}]}
