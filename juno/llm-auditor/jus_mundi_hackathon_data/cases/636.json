This dissent refers only to the conclusions reached by the Decision in respect of Mr. Waguih Siag. For everything else I am in agreement with my learned colleagues.\n\n[2].\n\nThe dissent is based on considerations that relate to both international law and the applicable Egyptian legislation. I shall address these matters in succession.\n\n*International Law Issues*\n--------------------------\n\n[3].\n\nThis case is quite unique in connection with the facts and the issues they raise concerning the nationality of individuals, as separate and distinct from the nationality of corporate entities and juridical persons. The more strict treatment that the ICSID Convention gives to the nationality of individuals, as compared to the flexibility evidenced in respect of corporate nationality, is well justified. In fact, nationality of individuals entails a link of allegiance with the nation and the State, while corporate nationality is more a question of convenience.\n\n[4].\n\nThis different treatment was explicitly explained in the Report of the Executive Directors accompanying the ICSID Convention (ICSID, Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention, 1986, Vol. II, Part 2, at 1078-1079).\n\n[5].\n\nWaguih is presently an Italian national who shows little or no connection with Italy, who further alleges now not to be Egyptian because he is Lebanese, but who claimed at all relevant times to be Egyptian, and whose links with Lebanon are not quite evident either.\n\n[6].\n\nAs the ICSID Convention does not define nationality, the principles of international law governing this matter come into play instantly. Cardinal among such principles is that of effectiveness. Ever since the *Nottebohm* case, this has been the accepted premise in international law and the recent work on the diplomatic protection of persons and property of both the International Law Commission and the International Law Association so confirms. There is no difference of opinion on this question with my learned colleagues.\n\n[7].\n\nThe difference arises in connection with the extent of the principle under Article 25(2)(a) of the Convention. The Decision believes the principle in question is only applicable in respect of questions of dual nationality, but in this case the loss of Egyptian nationality means that Waguih is not a dual national. True enough, dual nationality is the most common situation in respect of which effectiveness applies. However, I tend to see the issue in broader terms, particularly in connection with the dates required under the Convention to satisfy the test of nationality.\n\n[8].\n\nThe drafting history of Article 25(2)(a) is unequivocal about the concern expressed by many countries that did not want to be taken to international arbitration by investors who were their nationals, even if holding the nationality of another Contracting Party as well. This concern is the one the Convention attends to, a situation which the Report of the Executive Directors explained in terms of considering a natural person who was a national of the State party to the dispute ineligible to be a party in proceedings under the Centre, even if he had the nationality of another State. The Report adds that \"[t]his ineligibility is absolute and cannot be cured even if the State party to the dispute had given its consent\" (Report cit., at 1078).\n\n[9].\n\nThis conclusion is equivalent to the recognition that the prohibition in question is a kind of rule of *jus cogens* which does not admit derogation by consent, at any rate for the parties to the Convention. Such kind of rule is not unknown in the practice of conventions that lay the constitutional foundations for the development of new aspects of the law.\n\n[10].\n\nIt is in this context that the situation of Waguih appears to be at odds with the meaning of the Convention. The investor was Egyptian at the time the investment was made, benefited from Egyptian legislation granting exclusive rights to Egyptian citizens and was at all times considered to be Egyptian, not just by the Egyptian Government but this was also his own understanding and that of his family. The argument relied upon by the Claimant to the effect that he had not realized that he had lost his Egyptian nationality, is a rather bad one.\n\n[11].\n\nThe fact that Waguih later acquired a different nationality (Italy) and allegedly lost his original nationality (Egypt) because of acquiring that of a third State (Lebanon), cannot in my view prevail over the precise prohibition of the Convention. It is on this point where I believe the Convention goes beyond the strict technical situation of dual nationals and the dates used to this effect and covers additional situations that could contradict the prohibition in question, not to mention the fact that otherwise there could be uncontrollable abuse arising from acquisition or loss of nationalities.\n\n[12].\n\nI am intrigued by the question of the dates the Convention uses to establish the eligibility of the claimant. This problem has not been argued or pleaded in this proceeding and in that respect the Decision is right in not considering it. However, I believe it is right on my part to raise the question even if no answer is readily available for the moment.\n\n[13].\n\nArticle 25(2)(a) of the Convention contains both the positive and the negative test in respect of who is an eligible claimant. The negative test, which is the one that matters here, establishes that a national of another Contracting State does not include as far as jurisdiction is concerned any person who on two dates had the nationality of the host and respondent State. The first is the date \"on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\" The second is the date of registration. My query relates to the first date. The Convention was quite evidently envisaging the most common situation foreseeable that is an agreement in which both parties express simultaneously their consent to arbitration. Bilateral Investment Treaties were not yet common at all. In that context, it made sense that the dates indicated would require the compliance with the negative test at the time that both parties expressed their consent and later at the time of registration, without further elaboration.\n\n[14].\n\nThis understanding changed when Bilateral Investment Treaties became widespread, as then the common situation became one where the State expresses its consent in the treaty and later the investor expresses its own consent in either a separate instrument or by simply applying to the Centre for the registration of its claim. At that point the expression of consent became decoupled and separated by a lapse of time, many times long. It has been often understood that the consent of the State was an offer, which upon acceptance by the investor became the consent to arbitration.\n\n[15].\n\nThis is the situation later reflected in Rule 2 of the ICSID Institution Rules which takes the \"[d]ate of consent\" to mean, when both parties did not act simultaneously, the date in which the second party acted, which is usually the case of the investor.\n\n[16].\n\nYet, the date in which the State expresses its consent in the treaty is not just an offer. It is much more than that and it has specific legal effects, including obligations of the host State under the treaty and the prohibition to exercise diplomatic protection by the other Contracting Party. The date of expression of consent for the State is that of the entry into force of the treaty or some other instrument which embodies that consent. When this consent is later matched by the consent of the foreign investor, the required conditions for submitting the dispute to arbitration are met, but the respective expressions of consent do not appear to change their dates. It is the operation of the principle of *pactum de contrahendo,* which not because it materializes at a different date it loses its mandatory nature.\n\n[17].\n\nThe drafting history of the Convention also evidences that the Bank\u2019s General Counsel was aware of the possibility of differed expressions of consent. In this respect he explained that consent may have been expressed in advance, for instance in a contract the parties to which agree to have recourse to conciliation or arbitration for the settlement of disputes arising out of the contract (ICSID, Documents cit., Vol. II, Part 1, at 77-78).\n\n[18].\n\nIn the light of this meaning, could it be held that the safeguard the State had under the Convention not to be taken to arbitration by those who were its own nationals at the time of expressing its consent, or at any rate at the time the investment was made, simply vanished? Could it be right that thereafter the process of eligibility would be controlled solely by the investor in the light of the situation prevailing at the time of its acceptance of consent, in disregard of the equivalent right of the State?\n\n[19].\n\nThis would certainly be at odds with the absolute prohibition of the Convention noted above and a peculiar way to derogate from a kind of rule of *jus cogens,* which not because it is different it is less mandatory. As noted, the Report of the Executive Directors explains the prohibition as absolute and does not distinguish whether the derogation it prohibits is contained in a contract or in a treaty.\n\n[20].\n\nEven in matters where the Convention has left the parties at liberty to define certain requirements concerning the jurisdiction of the Centre, the definitions adopted cannot be contrary to the meaning of the Convention in respect of the exercise of jurisdiction by the Centre. This happens, for example, in connection with the definition of investment, where the liberty of the parties does not extend as far as to consider an investment something that would be entirely at odds with the meaning of the Convention. Similar is the situation of nationality, where, moreover, the Convention itself contains specific limits.\n\n[21].\n\nIn this context, an alternative reading of the Convention to the effect that the negative test applies not only at the date in which the investor consents but also at that in which the State consents, or at the date the investment was made as some treaties require, would be plausible and much in harmony with the meaning of the Convention in the light of its drafting history. In such a case, the interpretation given by the Institutional Rules would need to be supplemented or clarified.\n\n[22].\n\nThis would mean in fact that an investor applying for ICSID proceedings would be required not to be a national of the host State on both the date of expression of consent by the State, or the date of making the investment, and that of its own expression of consent, and then again at the time of registration. This would certainly prevent many kinds of abuse. This is not the same as the traditional requirement of continuing nationality because there could be changes in between both dates of expression of consent. Yet, it would ensure that if the individual was a national of the State party at the outset it would still be ineligible later.\n\n[23].\n\nSuch considerations reinforce my concern that Waguih is not a rightful claimant as far as jurisdiction is concerned because of the effectiveness of the connections he had with Egypt at all relevant times. Neither Italian nor Lebanese nationalities play any meaningful role In Wagulh\u2019s life.\n\n[24].\n\nMoreover, there are elements In the record that allow being skeptical about the other nationalities that come Into play In this case. While the Respondent has not objected to the existence of Italian nationality, there have been arguments advanced by Egypt questioning how serious or rightful this acquisition was. Certainly there is nothing as effectiveness in the link with Italy.\n\n[25].\n\nIt must also be noted that the whole argument of Waguih is constructed on the basis of the acquisition of Lebanese nationality and the effect this would have had in the loss of his Egyptian nationality. It is also possible to have serious doubts about how serious or rightful this other acquisition was. The certificate granted by a Secretary of the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo and the documents that followed from the Lebanese Ministry of the interior are quite feeble and unconvincing. There is no reference to any record or file and the answer of the Lebanese Embassy to an inquiry by Egypt\u2019s counsel in this case was extremely vague and unhelpful.\n\n[26].\n\nIt has been well established that in matters of nationality government certificates are just *prima facie* evidence of such nationality. There is good reason in this case to believe that doubtful documentary evidence does not meet the evidentiary requirements that would be needed to prevail over the effectiveness of the links with Egypt.\n\n*The Interpretation of Egypt\u2019s Nationality Law*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n[27].\n\nThere is no disagreement with my learned colleagues about the fact that International law leaves the determination of nationality to the legislation of the State concerned, in this case Egypt. Yet, this does not mean that International law loses control over such determinations as it will be always in the position to decide about matters on which that law is not clear or contradictory, just as the Decision underlines.\n\n[28].\n\nThis brings us to the interpretation of Egypt\u2019s Nationality Law. As explained in detail in the Decision, the issue concerns the meaning of Article 10, par. 3, of this Law. I am most grateful for the Illuminating discussion that in this matter was provided by counsel for both parties and learned experts on constitutional law. For the sake of clarity, may I repeat the key provision in question:\n\nHowever, permission to acquire a foreign nationality may allow the person for whom such permission is given, his wife and minor children to retain the Egyptian nationality, provided he notifies his wish to take advantage of such benefit within a period not exceeding one year from the date of acquiring the foreign nationality, and in such case they may retain the Egyptian nationality despite having acquired a foreign nationality.\n\n[29].\n\nThe Decision opts for one interpretation that concludes that because Waguih did not confirm his intention of retaining Egyptian nationality within one year after he was authorized by the Egyptian authorities to acquire Lebanese nationality and also retain Egyptian nationality, he lost his Egyptian nationality.\n\n[30].\n\nI have favored a different interpretation. One must first note that Article 10, par. 1, prohibits the acquisition of foreign nationality (\"may not acquire\"), except if permitted by Decree. This acquisition is not otherwise recognized under the Law (\"shall still be considered an Egyptian in every respect and under all circumstances\").\n\n[31].\n\nWaguih acquired Lebanese nationality in breach of this prohibition, apparently with a view to be dispensed from service in the Egyptian army. There are no records available about the legal basis on which he acquired that nationality. He only applied for permission later, including the request to remain Egyptian. This permission was granted and, therefore, it validates retroactively the earlier, unlawful acquisition of foreign nationality. Otherwise in the light of Egypt\u2019s law, Waguih would have no Lebanese nationality at all as he did not acquire that nationality after the Decree, only before, and this is then accepted by the Egyptian Government.\n\n[32].\n\nOne must turn next to the purpose of par. 3 reproduced above. This is to ensure that he who becomes a foreign national and has been granted permission to remain Egyptian, has one year \"from the date of acquiring the foreign nationality\" to make up his mind and notify his wish to take advantage of such benefit. The date of acquiring the foreign nationality is in this case prior to that of the Decree. There is no such date afterwards.\n\n[33].\n\nThe law does not say what Professor Riad, a distinguished constitutional scholar appearing for Waguih, would like it to say, namely that the one year is counted from the date in which the Government acknowledges the existence of a foreign nationality. Professor Riad\u2019s view to the effect that the whole process only begins when the authorizing decree is enacted is not tenable, as then the decree would validate an act retroactively but not a subordinate right such as the notification. Either it applies retroactively to the act and its subordinate rights, in which case the whole process is validated, or it applies only prospectively, in which case there is no foreign nationality at all because none was acquired after the Decree, lawfully or unlawfully, and no subordinate right can be exercised either.\n\n[34].\n\nAs the foreign nationality has been validated retroactively, it is the earlier point in time that triggers the year to make up his mind. If as a foreign national he later requests to keep his Egyptian nationality, it is this specific request that must be considered the act of making up his mind and so having notified. In other words, the purpose of paragraph 3 is met at the point of so requesting and this is the point of completion of the transitional period. Waguih exercised this option within the period mandated by the Law. In fact, he exercised it in a matter of days (15 December 1989 foreign nationality is acquired; on 19 December 1989 he requests to remain Egyptian).\n\n[35].\n\nEgyptian law must be applied in its entirety. This is not just Article 10, par. 3, it is also par. 1, under which the acquisition of foreign nationality without prior permission is illegal and hence does not deprive Waguih of his Egyptian nationality.\n\n[36].\n\nIt is quite true that Egyptian law and administrative practices require many formalities, including the confirmation needed under Article 10, par. 3. Yet, here again is where international law must intervene. In leaving the determination of nationality to the State in question, international law is only concerned with the substance of the law, not the procedure. International law would be concerned, for example, with whether the law applies *jus sanguinis* or *jus soli,* but not about the procedures for handling such substantive determinations.\n\n[37].\n\nIn the instant case, what matters for the determination of jurisdictional requirements under the Convention is whether Waguih expressed its intent to remain Egyptian, which he did in applying to retain Egyptian nationality; whether this was done before the competent authority, which it was as the request was made to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior; and whether this was done within the period mandated by the law, which was also the case as the expression of intent came within a few days after the acquisition of foreign nationality. It would not matter whether Waguih used form A or B, which is purely a minor administrative requirement.\n\n[38].\n\nMany interpretations of the law are always possible and I, of course, greatly respect that for which my learned colleagues have opted. I submit, however, that the interpretation I have offered is the one which better serves the purposes of the Convention.\n\n[39].\n\nIndeed, much concern has been expressed in contemporary international law about the use of flags of convenience, whether in connection with maritime transportation, fisheries or any other matter. In the instant case, the principle of effectiveness prevents that the use of a nationality which is more convenient to Waguih might prevail over the real and effective nationality.\n\n*Conclusion*\n------------\n\n[40].\n\nIn the end, I believe that the whole question of having acquired Lebanese nationality is in essence artificial as far as the investment is concerned. The investment was made by an Egyptian citizen, a fact which is not disputed by the parties, who has effectively kept all his links with that country, who wishes to remain Egyptian, who then alleges to have become Lebanese and to have lost his Egyptian nationality, but who does not claim under the existing BIT between Egypt and Lebanon, but under a BIT with Italy, a country with which he has at best remote connections.\n\n[41].\n\nThis is not what international law or the ICSID Convention could have possibly intended. Neither is it what the expression of consent of Egypt could have possibly meant or what the Egypt\u2019s Nationality Law could be taken to say.\n\n[42].\n\nAgain regretting not to be able to join the view of my learned colleagues in so far as Waguih is concerned, I look forward to working with them and the parties in the merits phase of this case which will now follow."}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request for Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 26 May 2005, Mr Waguih Elie George Siag and Ms Clorinda Vecchi (\"Mr Siag\" and \"Ms Vecchi,\" collectively \"the Claimants\") filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") a Request for Arbitration (\"the Request\") directed against the Arab Republic of Egypt (\"Egypt\" or \"the Respondent\"). The Request invoked the ICSID arbitration provision of Article 9 of the Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments between the Republic of Italy and the Arab Republic of Egypt dated 2 March 1989 (the \"BIT\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Centre, on 2 June 2005, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID institution Rules\") acknowledged receipt of the request and on the same day transmitted a copy to Egypt and to the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n3.\n\nThereafter, Egypt by letter to ICSID dated 29 June 2005 objected to the registration of the Request on the grounds that the dispute was outside the jurisdiction of ICSID. The Claimants responded by letter of 8 July 2005 stating that the objections raised by Egypt were entirely without merit. ICSID received further correspondence on this issue from Egypt dated 1 August 2005 and from the Claimants dated 4 August 2005.\n\n4.\n\nThe Request was registered by the Centre on 5 August 2005, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\") and on the same day the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and Commencement of the Proceeding**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nFollowing the registration of the Request by the Centre, the parties agreed on a three-member Tribunal. The parties agreed that each would appoint an arbitrator and that the third arbitrator, who would be the president of the Tribunal, would be appointed by agreement of the two party appointed arbitrators.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimants appointed Professor Michael Pryles, a national of Australia, Level 18, 333 Collins Street, Melbourne, Australia and the Respondent appointed Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a national of Chile, Abenida El Golf 40, Piso 6, Santiago, Chile.\n\n7.\n\nThe two party appointed arbitrators appointed as President of the Tribunal, Mr David A R Williams QC, a national of New Zealand, Bankside Chambers, Level 22, 88 Shortland Street, Auckland, New Zealand.\n\n8.\n\nAll three arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Centre by a letter of 10 January 2006 informed the parties of the constitution of the Tribunal, and that the proceeding was deemed to have commenced on that day, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID\u2019s Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"the ICSID Arbitration Rules\"). The parties were further informed that Ms Milanka Kostadinova, Senior Counsel at ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Written and Oral Procedure**\n---------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), after consulting with the parties and the Centre, the Tribunal scheduled a first session, in Pahs for 24 March 2006. By letter of 16 March 2006, the Claimants advised that no agreement between the parties had been reached on the procedural matters identified in the provisional agenda for the first session, which had been sent to them by the Tribunal\u2019s Secretary. The Claimants set out their comments on a suggested procedural timetable including how the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction should be dealt with. By letter dated 20 March 2006, the Respondent set forth its agreement that the language of the arbitration should be English and also expressed its views as to an appropriate timetable for the determination of its objections to jurisdiction.\n\n10.\n\nAt the first session of the Tribunal, held in Pahs on 24 March 2006, the procedural issues were discussed and agreed. All the conclusions were reflected in the written minutes of the session, signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal and provided to the parties, as well as all Members of the Tribunal. It was agreed that the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction would be treated as a preliminary question. A schedule for the filing of memorials and for the holding of a hearing on jurisdiction in Pahs on 8-9 August 2006 was agreed.\n\n11.\n\nIt was agreed at the first session that the Claimant would file its Memorial on the Merits in advance to any objections to jurisdiction the Respondent wished to file. Pursuant to the agreed schedule the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits on 12 May 2006 along with the Witness Statements of Waguih Elie George Siag dated 8 May 2006 and Dr Mustafa Abou Zeid Fahmy dated 2 May 2006.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 12 June 2006 along with the Expert Opinion of Dr Hafiza El Haddad and the Joint Expert Opinion of Prof Dr Mohamed El-Said El-Dakkak and Prof Dr Okasha Mohamed Abdel Aal. The Claimants submitted a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 12 July 2006 supported by the Expert Opinion of Prof. Fouad A Riad dated 10 July 2006 and the Expert Opinion of Prof W Michael Reisman dated 12 July 2006.\n\n13.\n\nThis was followed, on 24 July 2006, by a Reply on Jurisdiction from the Respondent and Supplementary Expert Opinion of Dr Hafiza El Haddad dated 24 July 2006. The Claimants then filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 4 August 2006 and the Expert Opinion of Prof. Fouad A Riad dated 1 August 2006 and the Expert Opinion of Prof. W Michael Reisman dated 31 July 2006.\n\n14.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction was held in Pahs on 8-9 August 2006, during which Mr Reginald R Smith, Mr Kenneth R Fleuriet and Mr R Doak Bishop addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants and Dr A Kamal Aboulmagd and Mr Hazim A Rizkana addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Respondent. No witnesses were called for cross-examination. Counsel for both parties presented oral submissions and answered questions from members of the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nAt the hearing, counsel for the Respondent made an application to file additional material after the conclusion of the hearing. After considering oral submissions by both sides the President granted the application on these terms:\n\nSo against that background the respondent\u2019s application to adduce additional material, specifically to supply copies of all the cases on the Article 10(3) issue referred to by the Professor this morning, along with any further submissions of counsel derived from those cases [...] that application will be admitted, on the basis that it must be supplied within 21 days from today\u2019s date.\n\n[...]\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s will have the right within a further 21 days, to respond to the materials adduced by the respondent, either, at their option, by way of further submissions from counsel or by way of further expert evidence, should they elect to adduce such evidence. They can either do one or the other, or both.1\n\nTranscript of the Hearing on Jurisdiction [hereinafter Transcript], Day 2, pp. 82-83 (emphasis added).\n\n16.\n\nPursuant to the permission granted at the hearing on 29 August 2006, Egypt filed its Submission in Relation to the Non-Applicability of Article 10(3) of the Egyptian Nationality Law No. 26 of 1975. On 11 September 2006, the Claimants filed their Reply to Egypt\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission. In their Reply submission the Claimants objected that Egypt\u2019s post-hearing submission exceeded the permission granted by the Arbitral Tribunal in that it contained submissions that were not derived from the additional cases which counsel for Egypt had sought permission to submit at the hearing. Given its findings set out below the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to rule on this objection.\n\n**II. BACKGROUND FACTS**\n------------------------\n\n17.\n\nAccording to the Request, in 1989 the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism sold a parcel of property on the Gulf of Aqaba to a company called Siag Touristic Investments and Hotels Management Company (\"Siag Touristic\"), which is owned principally by the Claimants. Siag Touristic is an Egyptian joint stock company. The purpose of the sale was to permit Siag Touristic to develop a tourist resort on the property. Development commenced on the property. However, in 1996 the property was confiscated by the Egyptian Government. Although the Claimants obtained relief from the Egyptian courts this was ignored by the Egyptian Government.\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimant seeks a declaration that the Respondent has violated the BIT, international law and Egyptian law, compensation for all damages suffered, costs and an award of compound interest.\n\n19.\n\nThe BIT has the objective of creating favourable conditions for greater economic cooperation between Italy and Egypt, particularly for investments by one Contracting State in the territory of the other. It is recognized that the encouragement and reciprocal protection under International agreements of such investments will be conducive to the stimulation of business initiative and will increase prosperity in both Contracting States. The BIT provides a number of guarantees and protections to investors including: (1) fair and equitable treatment of investments; (2) a prohibition against unreasonable or discriminatory measures; (3) most favoured nation treatment of investments; (4) most favoured nation treatment of activity in connection with investments; (5) full protection; (6) a prohibition against measures that limit the right of ownership, possession, control, or enjoyment of investments; and (7) a prohibition against direct or indirect nationalization or expropriation, or measures having an equivalent effect, except for a public purpose in the national interest and against payment of adequate and fair compensation calculated at market value. Article 9 of the BIT is devoted to dispute resolution and provides, *inter alia,* the right of investors to resort to arbitration pursuant to the ICSID Convention.\n\n20.\n\nEgypt ratified the ICSID Convention on 3 May 1972. Italy did so on 29 March 1971.\n\n21.\n\nArticle 25(1) and 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.

THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES ON JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants argued in the Request that the Respondent had consented to ICSID arbitration of disputes such as their investment in Siag Touristic by virtue of signing and ratifying the BIT which contains an ICSID arbitration clause (Article 9).\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nOn 12 June 2006, the Respondent filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction. Its principal arguments are summarized in paragraphs 25 to 42 hereafter.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent asserted that the Claimants have failed to satisfy the *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae* requirements under Article 25(1) and (2) of the ICSID Convention. As to Mr Siag, he was born as an Egyptian national on 12 March 1962. When Mr Siag\u2019s father died in 1987 the Claimants and the rest of the Siag family took over the family businesses. One of these businesses was Siag Touristic. In 1993 Siag Touristic entered into a Conditional Sale Contract with the Touristic Development Authority to develop a large plot of land in the southern area of Taba. The purpose was to develop a touristic resort. In 1993 another company was formed, Siag Taba.\n\n26.\n\nPursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention it was indisputable that the investor in ICSID proceedings is subject to a positive and negative nationality requirement. It was further submitted that the determination of whether an investor was a national of an ICSID Contracting State and not a national of the host State should be made by reference to the domestic law of the State whose nationality was at issue.\n\nMr Siag\n-------\n\n27.\n\nWith respect to Mr Siag, it was noted that he based his claim that he lost Egyptian nationality on his subsequent acquisition of Lebanese nationality. The evidence of Lebanese nationality, in the form of copies of relevant parts of his Lebanese passport submitted to the Egyptian Minister of Interior on 19 December 1989 in an application for permission to acquire Lebanese nationality, was inconclusive and did not establish the date of acquisition of such nationality.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent asserted that Mr Siag\u2019s interpretation of the Nationality Law was incorrect. Under Article 10, a person who desired to acquire foreign nationality must obtain prior permission to this effect from the Egyptian Minister of Interior. When permission is granted the Minister may also give an applicant the option to maintain his/her Egyptian nationality, by means of a declaration made to this effect within a one-year period following the acquisition of foreign nationality. The Respondent relied on an interpretation of Article 10 which would require no further expression within the one-year period once permission was granted and the foreign nationality was acquired. It was stated that this interpretation was supported by mainstream Egyptian jurisprudence.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent also submitted that from the time of acquiring Lebanese nationality in 1990, Mr Siag was aware of his Egyptian nationality up to the time he revealed his Italian nationality in the context of asserting Egypt\u2019s violations of the BIT in October 2004. He was issued with numerous Egyptian nationality certificates from 1991-1997. Mr Siag had also made a number of declarations concerning his nationality status as an Egyptian for the purposes of the Siag Touristic and Siag Taba companies and the development in Taba. The Respondent referred to the *Champion Trading* case where the ICSID Tribunal stated:\n\nThe mere fact that this investment in Egypt by the three individual Claimants was done by using, for whatever reason and purpose, exclusively their Egyptian nationality clearly qualifies them as dual nationals within the meaning of the Convention and thereby based on Article 25(2) (a) excludes them from invoking the Convention.4\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 57, citing *Champion Trading Company et. al. v Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/9, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 October 2003, *reproduced in* 19 ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 275, 289 (2004).\n\n30.\n\nIt could be inferred from the application for permission that Mr Siag submitted on 19 December 1989 that he acquired Lebanese nationality through an application of the *jus sanguinis.* This being the case the application for permission could be characterized as an application for recognition and the decree of the Egyptian Minister of Interior more in the nature of an official recognition of Lebanese nationality.\n\n31.\n\nArticle 10 deals with instances of the acquisition of a foreign nationality only after permission is granted from the Egyptian Minister of Interior. In those circumstances there were two alternatives: (1) permission granted while maintaining Egyptian nationality and (2) permission granted without the right to maintain Egyptian nationality, in which case the person may express his/her desire to maintain Egyptian nationality within the one-year period.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent concluded that since the third paragraph of Article 10 did not apply to Mr Siag, pursuant to the first part of Article 10 of the Nationality Law he was to be treated as Egyptian in all respects and under all circumstances. He could only lose his Egyptian nationality through a decree from the Egyptian Cabinet under Article 16 of the Nationality Law.\n\nMs Vecchi\n---------\n\n33.\n\nMs Vecchi was married to Mr Siag\u2019s father, Mr Elie Siag. She applied for Egyptian nationality on 20 April 1955 pursuant to Egyptian Nationality Law 160 of 1950 and on the expiration of two years acquired Egyptian nationality under the Nationality Law No. 391 of 1956 on 19 April 1957. She lost her Italian nationality at this time.\n\n34.\n\nRelying on Article 8 of the Nationality Law the Claimants asserted that Ms Vecchi reacquired her Italian nationality in 1993. Even after this date several documents, such as her passport and nationality certificates, evidenced Ms Vecchi\u2019s continued Egyptian nationality.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent asserted that the Claimants interpretation of Article 8 was flawed. The scope of Article 8 was limited to foreign women who acquired Egyptian nationality \"pursuant to the provisions of the two previous articles.\" It was submitted that Ms Vecchi was not a \"foreign woman\" pursuant to Article 7 of the Nationality Law since she came within the definition of an Egyptian national under Article 1 (Second) of the Nationality Law. Since she was an Egyptian national the only way Ms Vecchi could lose her Egyptian nationality was by virtue of a decree of Cabinet pursuant to Article 16.\n\n36.\n\nIt may be noted that the Respondent based its *ratione personae* objections to jurisdiction solely on its assertions as to the true construction of the Nationality Law.\n\nExistence of an \"Investment\"\n----------------------------\n\n37.\n\nWith respect to the requirement of an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Respondent submitted that there must be expenditure and that such expenditure must have a foreign origin. As to expenditure, the Respondent asserted that the Claimants had not demonstrated that they made personal expenditure. The expenditure cited by the Claimants in their Memorial was in fact corporate expenditure by the companies, Siag Touristic and Siag Taba.\n\n38.\n\nAs to the foreign element, the Respondent relied on the Preamble to the ICSID Convention which states that the Contracting States should \"[consider] the need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein.\" Taking into account the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention the Respondent concluded that the origin of capital was relevant, decisive and crucial. The Respondent pointed to two ICSID decisions said to identify an injection of funds principle.5\n\nSGS *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003; *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004.\n\n39.\n\nTurning to the specific terms of the BIT the Respondent referred to the preamble, which states:\n\nThe Government of the Republic of Italy and [Egypt]\n\n[...]\n\nRecogniz[e] that the encouragement and reciprocal protection under international agreement of such investment will be conducive to the stimulation of business initiative and will increase prosperity in both Contracting States [...].\n\n40.\n\nBased on this passage the Respondent submitted that the origin of capital requirement was further narrowed down so as to require an Italian origin. This was said to be further supported by Article 6 of the BIT which speaks of \"repatriation.\" The Italian origin of investment had not been established.\n\n41.\n\nIn the event the Claimants were able to satisfy the nationality requirement of the ICSID Convention the Respondent asserted that they should be estopped from bringing their claim due to the concealment of their Italian nationalities. Such concealment had resulted in the possibility that the Claimants would become unexpected beneficiaries of the protections afforded in the BIT.\n\n42.\n\nFor all the reasons set forth in its Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Respondent requested a declaration that this dispute did not fall within the jurisdiction of the Centre and that the Claimants\u2019 claims were inadmissible. The Respondent also requested the Tribunal to order the Claimants to compensate it for all the costs and expenses of this proceeding including legal fees.\n\n**B. The Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimants filed a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on 12 July 2006, which contended that the Claimants had satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 9 of the BIT. The Claimants\u2019 principal arguments are summarized in paragraphs 44 to 68 below.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that, based on the Respondent\u2019s Memorial, some aspects of jurisdiction were agreed. These were the Italian nationality of the Claimants, Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality, the existence of a \"legal dispute\" and the parties\u2019 consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n45.\n\nAs to the negative nationality requirement under Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention the Claimants asserted that on the date the parties consented to arbitration and the date the Request was registered they were not Egyptian nationals. By operation of the Nationality Law, Mr Siag lost Egyptian nationality on 14 June 1990 and Ms Vecchi lost Egyptian nationality on 14 September 1993.\n\n46.\n\nClaimants agreed with the Respondent that the determination of a person\u2019s nationality was controlled by the laws of the State whose nationality was in question. Reference was made to Article 1 of the 1930 Hague Convention, which provides:\n\nIt is for each State to determine under its own law who are its nationals.\n\n47.\n\nArticle 2 provides:\n\nAny question as to whether a person possesses the nationality of a particular State shall be determined in accordance with the law of that State.\n\n48.\n\nAs to the practice of ICSID Tribunals, the Claimants noted that this principle had also been observed by ICSID Tribunals.6 On the question of the various documents of the Claimants evidencing Egyptian nationality which had been referred to by the Respondent, the Claimants submitted that such documents were *prima facie* evidence of nationality only and could not supersede the application of the relevant nationality law. Analysis of the applicable nationality law should be made by the international tribunal. The Tribunal should not just blithely apply the conclusions reached by the authorities in the State in question when issuing documents evidencing nationality.\n\nThe example given was *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v The United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Award, 7 July 2004 [hereinafter *Soufraki],*\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s reference to the **Champion Trading** case was said to have been taken out of context and did not support the conclusion that in this case the Claimants held Egyptian nationality at the relevant times for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. In the **Champion Trading** case the Tribunal applied the Egyptian nationality law and based on that application found that the three brothers held Egyptian nationality and so did not satisfy the negative nationality requirement. It was irrelevant how the children were characterized when making the investment. That case emphasized the primacy of an application of the domestic law of the State in question to determine nationality. The Claimants noted that the *Champion Trading* Tribunal had held that there was no room in an application of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention for a \"dominant\" or \"effective\" nationality analysis. Under Egyptian law the provisions of the nationality laws are the exclusive determinant of Egyptian nationality. If a person failed to satisfy those provisions, Egyptian nationality was lost *ipso jure.*\n\n50.\n\nAny instruments or acts in contravention of the nationality laws could have no effect. The Claimants referred to the expert opinion of Professor F Riad, a member of the Law Faculty at Cairo University. Professor Riad stated:\n\nIt should be emphasized that all provisions relating to the Laws of Nationality are *per se* a matter of public order, since they relate to one of the fundamental Laws of the State. The Egyptian Constitution of 1971 specifies in its article (6) that \"The Egyptian nationality is regulated by the law.\" Hence, any decision or regulation or instrument inferior to legislation should not be taken into consideration with regard to nationality except as provided by the said Law. Any such inferior instrument or act is null and void and has no legal weight or value if it contradicts the provisions of the Nationality Law.7\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Dr Riad, 10 July 2006, para. 38.\n\n51.\n\nThis conclusion was said to be supported by the decisions of Egypt\u2019s courts. One decision of the Administrative Court stated that \"[w]hereas the establishment of the nationality of a person is determined exclusively by the provisions of the legislation regulating the nationality, all data in documents, even official, have no legal value in proving the Egyptian nationality.\"8 More recently the Supreme Administrative Court, in a case involving the application of Article 10 of the Nationality Law,9 held that three separate confirmations of Egyptian nationality were irrelevant because they violated the terms of the Nationality Law. Similarly, the Egyptian courts had held that the acquisition or use of an Egyptian passport is only *prima facie* evidence of Egyptian nationality, which can only be determined by operation of the law.10\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 21 (referring to Prof Dr Riad\u2019s Expert Opinion, who cites a Decision of the Supreme Administrative Court of 28 December 1965).\n\nSupreme Administrative Court, Decision of 10 December 2000, Nos. 1946 and 1947 of Judicial Year 47 [hereinafter the *Saleh* case],\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 24-28.\n\nMr Siag\n-------\n\n52.\n\nIt was contended that Mr Slag had lost his Egyptian nationality by operation of the Nationality Law. Pursuant to Article 10, Mr Siag was granted permission to acquire Lebanese nationality by decree of the Egyptian Minister of Interior on 5 March 1990. For the purposes of Article 10 he acquired Lebanese nationality on 14 June 1990 and lost Egyptian nationality on the same date. Mr Siag could have sought to retain his Egyptian nationality by making a declaration to that effect within one year. However, he did not do so.\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimants rejected the Respondent\u2019s assertion that mainstream Egyptian jurisprudence and the opinion of legal scholars does not favour a literal reading of the declaration requirement in the third paragraph of Article 10. Indeed, the opinion of Professor Riad was that such an interpretation would render the third paragraph of Article 10 meaningless.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimants also referred to the case of Mr Saleh in the Supreme Administrative Court. Mr Saleh\u2019s candidacy for parliament was contested on the basis that he was a dual-national of Germany and Egypt. The Supreme Administrative Court held:\n\nFurther, the Egyptian nationality automatically terminates when an Egyptian obtains a foreign nationality with the requisite permission. However, the permission to obtain a foreign nationality may also grant an Egyptian national and his wife and children the option to maintain their Egyptian nationality, if he declares his desire to benefit from this exception within a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquiring foreign nationality. In the latter case, the husband and wife and children continue to be Egyptian nationals even though they obtained a foreign nationality.\n\nIt is understood from the previous passage that the legislator has resolved that an Egyptian national who is permitted to obtain a foreign nationality and who does so loses his Egyptian citizenship. However, the legislator also resolved that the person has the right to request that he maintain his Egyptian citizenship, if the right is exercised within the specified period immediately after obtaining the foreign nationality. That period may not exceed one year from the date on which the foreign nationality is acquired. A newly naturalized person that successfully declares this intention will remain an Egyptian national. However, the legislator placed a key condition on the newly naturalized person\u2019s ability to successfully retain Egyptian nationality. In order to possess the right to remain an Egyptian national, the Minister of Interior\u2019s decree authorizing the foreign citizenship must also expressly authorize maintaining the Egyptian nationality. In addition, section 2 of article 18 states, \"an Egyptian nationality that is lost by foreign naturalization may be reacquired by a decree from the Minister of Interior to that effect.\" Accordingly, a person that loses the Egyptian nationality by acquiring another (with permission) does not automatically regain his right to maintain his Egyptian nationality by simply submitting an application to that effect. To the contrary, the person can only regain that right by a decree to that effect issued by the Minister of Interior, which is the entity entrusted by the legislature to reinstate the Egyptian nationality when the Egyptian nationality is either: lost because the granted permission approving the acquisition of the foreign nationality did not also approve retaining the Egyptian nationality; or lost because the granted permission did in fact expressly approve retaining the Egyptian nationality but that right was not exercised within the requisite period set by the law.11\n\nThe *Saleh* case, *supra* note 9, pp. 7-8. The Claimants also refer to similar statements of the Supreme Administrative Court in Decision of 21 December 2002, No. 6083 of Judicial Year 47, pp. 3-5.\n\n55.\n\nAs to opinions of legal scholars, the Claimants submitted that the requirement for a declaration within one year under the third paragraph of Article 10 was recognized by Professor Riad and also by Professor A Algedaoui.12 In the Claimants view, the opinion of Professor A Salama, referred to by the Respondent\u2019s experts, Dr M El-Dakkak,13 and Prof Dr O Abdel Aal,14 to support the view that the declaration requirement is ignored, had been misquoted. In fact, Professor Salama acknowledged the declaration requirement but supported a change to this requirement. The Respondent\u2019s experts, Drs Abdel Aal and El Haddad, had also recently released a book15 where they had acknowledged that an explicit expression of the wish to retain Egyptian nationality must be made within a one-year period or the right to retain Egyptian nationality would be lost.\n\nHead of the Private International Law Department at Ain Shams University.\n\nProfessor of International General Law, Alexandria University.\n\nProfessor of Private International Law, Alexandria University.\n\nDrs Hisham Sadek, Abdel Aal and El Haddad, The Nationality and the Status of Foreigners -Comparative Study (2006), pp. 4-6.\n\n56.\n\nAs to the Respondent\u2019s contention that Article 10 of the Nationality Law did not apply to Mr Siag because he acquired Lebanese nationality prior to submitting his application for permission to the Egyptian Minister of Interior the Respondent was attempting to utilize part of Article 10 while denying the application of the rest of the article.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that the time when Mr Siag acquired Lebanese nationality as a matter of Lebanese law was irrelevant to the questions of Egyptian nationality raised in this arbitration. Egyptian law was competent only to establish the acquisition or loss of Egyptian nationality and the circumstances in which Egypt will recognize a foreign nationality. The reference in the Nationality Law to the acquisition of a foreign nationality meant acquisition in the eyes of Egyptian law. As explained by Professor Riad:\n\nIf Article 10 were to be understood as inapplicable to any Egyptian who acquires a foreign nationality under foreign law prior to requesting Egypt\u2019s permission, no Egyptian who acquired a foreign nationality prior to 1975 (when Article 10 was enacted) would ever be able to have that nationality recognized by Egypt, even if such a person subsequently went through the procedure of Article 10. It would also seem that no Egyptian born with a second nationality could ever benefit from the options provided by Article 10. Article 10 was not intended to discriminate among Egyptians, with random timing creating one group that could have another nationality recognized and another group that would never be able to do so. Such a situation would clearly constitute a violation of one of the main principles of the Egyptian Constitution, according to which all Egyptians are equal under the law.16\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Dr Riad of 10 July 2006, para. 33.\n\n58.\n\nArticle 10 of the Nationality Law required a person to seek permission from the Egyptian Minister of Interior before a foreign nationality could be acquired in the eyes of Egyptian law. Once permission was granted, the date of acquisition was the first date on which there was a \"formal expression\" of Lebanese nationality after the issuance of the Egyptian Minister of Interior\u2019s authorization. This date was 14 June 1990 when Mr Siag was issued a Lebanese passport.\n\n59.\n\nEven if the date of acquisition of foreign nationality referred to the date upon which Mr Siag acquired Lebanese nationality in the eyes of Lebanese law, pursuant to Article 10 the Egyptian Minister of Interior had considered Mr Siag\u2019s application and granted Mr Siag permission. Once that occurred Mr Siag was entitled to go through the Article 10 procedure. The opinion of Dr Abdel Aad and Dr El Haddad,17 in their 2006 book was that a person who acquires a foreign nationality was entitled to subsequently seek the permission of the Egyptian Minister of Interior\u2019s under Article 10. Their conclusion was that the date of acquisition in this case was the date on which permission had been granted by the Egyptian Minister of Interior.18 The only difference between the opinions of the experts therefore was the date of loss of nationality. The Respondent\u2019s experts maintained that it was lost on 5 March 1990 the date permission was granted by the Egyptian Minister of Interior. Irrespective of the date chosen, Mr Siag had not made the required declaration within the one year period.\n\nProfessor of Private International Law and International Commercial Arbitration at Alexandria University.\n\nThe Claimants noted that this conclusion was the opposite to the statement made on page 5 in Professor El Haddad\u2019s Expert Opinion. *See* Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 6 *7-* 68.\n\nMs Vecchi\n---------\n\n60.\n\nIn the case of Ms Vecchi the Claimants contended that she *ipso jure* lost her Egyptian nationality on September 14, 1993 pursuant to Article 8 of the Nationality Law. Article 8 of the Nationality Law referred to the factual situations described in Articles 6 and 7 notwithstanding that, as in the case of Ms Vecchi, Egyptian nationality was acquired under a previous nationality law. This reading of Article 8 was reinforced by the fact that the wording in Article 7 was identical to the provisions in previous nationality laws.\n\n61.\n\nAs to the argument that Ms Vecchi was not a \"foreign woman\" due to Article 1 of the Nationality Law, the Claimants replied that Article 1 had nothing to do with the situation of Ms Vecchi. As explained by Professor Riad, Article 1 established who were \"original\" Egyptians prior to the brief union of Egypt and Syria as the United Arab Republic between 1958 and 1961:\n\nMarriage to an Egyptian national was the sole cause of Ms Vecchi\u2019s acquisition of Egyptian nationality. That fact is not altered in any way by the provisions of Article 1 of the Law No. 26 of 1975. As this law was the first nationality law to be enacted after the separation of Egypt and Syria from their brief union as the United Arab Republic, Article 1 endeavored to draw a global distinction between those who were Egyptian before that union and those who were not. In other words, this article has nothing to do with the grounds on which the nationality of each Egyptian is established. Hence, it has no relevance to the way Ms Vecchi acquired her Egyptian nationality and does not mean that she falls outside of Article 8 of Law No. 26, dealing with foreign women who acquired the Egyptian nationality by marriage to an Egyptian.19\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Dr Riad of 10 July 2006, para. 51.\n\nExistence of an \"Investment\"\n----------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimants contended that they had established jurisdiction *ratione materiae.* The Respondent\u2019s contentions that the Claimants had not proven personal expenditure and that there was an origin of capital requirement were groundless.\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants contested the Respondent\u2019s assertion that they did not make investments in their personal capacities. In any event, it was submitted that it was irrelevant that the Claimants may have invested through the corporate vehicles, Siag Touristic and Siag Taba.\n\n64.\n\nThe definition of \"investment\" under the BIT covered \"every kind of asset invested [...] by a natural or juridical person [...] in the territory or maritime zones of the other Contracting State.\" The BIT included a non-exhaustive list of examples of \"investments.\" The Claimants submitted that they had made \"investments\" for the purposes of the BIT by acquiring shares in Siag Touristic and Siag Taba and by acquiring \"claims to money\" from Siag Touristic and Siag Taba related to the land purchased in Taba and the development of the touristic resort. Through their shareholdings in these companies the Claimants invested in \"movable and immovable property\" and acquired other \"property rights *in rem\"* and \"rights conferred by law or contract.\"\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that the Respondent\u2019s contention that the ICSID Convention and the BIT contained and express or implied \"origin of capital\" requirement found no support in the ICSID Convention, the BIT or the object purpose of these two instruments. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention intentionally did not limit the term \"investment.\" It was to be given \"broad reach.\"20 In the BIT \"investment\" was given a broad definition and the types of investment given as examples were also defined broadly. The Claimants also contended that the Respondent\u2019s reliance on repatriation of returns was misplaced and did not support an \"Italian capital\" requirement. On the issue of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention the Claimants asserted that imposing an origin of capital requirement would have a chilling effect and discourage foreign investment.\n\n*Fedax N.V. v Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997 [hereinafter *Fedax],* para. 24.\n\n66.\n\nOther ICSID Tribunals had categorically rejected the \"origin of capital\" argument. The Claimants referred to the case of *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine.21* The Tribunal in *Tokios Tokeles* rejected the argument that an origin of capital requirement ought to be implied into the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Tokios Tokeles* v *Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2004, 20 ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 205 (2005) [hereinafter *Tokios Tokeles],*\n\n67.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent\u2019s estoppel argument, the Claimants submitted that this was not a jurisdictional issue under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention or Article 9 of the BIT but was related to the merits. In any event the suggestion that the Claimants had \"concealed\" their Italian nationality was rejected. The Claimants also submitted that being held to the standards of investment protection in the BIT was not \"detriment\" for the purposes of an estoppel claim.\n\n68.\n\nIn their request for relief the Claimants asked the Tribunal to make a decision which would:\n\n(i) Dismiss Egypt\u2019s objections to jurisdiction in their entirety.\n\n(ii) Award the Claimants all costs of the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings plus interest.\n\n(iii) Order the continuance of the merits phase of the proceeding.\n\n**C. The Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nOn 24 July 2006 the Respondent filed a Reply on Jurisdiction. Its principal arguments are summarized below in paragraphs 70 to 88.\n\n70.\n\nAfter making some preliminary observations the Respondent stated that it did not intend to deviate from the objections it had initially raised and presented in its Memorial on Jurisdiction. It said:\n\nIn sum, Egypt\u2019s objections on jurisdiction rests on the following:\n\n(i) lack of jurisdiction *rationae personae* due to the Egyptian nationality of claimants [...] and\n\n(ii) lack of jurisdiction *rationae materiae* due to the lack of investment in the specific meaning of the Convention and the BIT [...].22\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 5.\n\n71.\n\nIn addition the Respondent further argued that the present dispute should not be admissible before the Centre and Claimants should, without hesitation, be estopped from seeking relief through the Centre.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondents also commented upon the observations raised in Professor Reisman\u2019s opinion23 as to the *bona fide* Italian nationality of Claimants. Professor Reisman\u2019s view was that both the Claimants had lost their Egyptian nationality by operation of Egyptian law and acquired Italian nationality. Therefore, any historic and continuing links they had to Egypt were irrelevant. Likewise, since they were not dual nationals a search for dominant or effective nationality was inapposite. Additionally, there was no suggestion that the Claimants\u2019 Italian nationality had been acquired fraudulently or as a mere expedient to bring these claims before ICSID.\n\n*Id.* para. 7, (referring to para. 26 of the Expert Opinion of Prof W Michael Reisman of 12 July 2006).\n\n73.\n\nIn response, the Respondent stated that it did not deal with the Italian nationality of the Claimants because of their established Egyptian nationality and links to Egypt. The Respondent noted its view that neither Mr Siag nor Ms Vecchi had the type of connections with Italy that would permit a finding of effective nationality under international law. Egypt was not required under international law to arbitrate an Investment with persons who had non-existent, spurious or insubstantial links to the State of which they might formally be nationals.\n\n74.\n\nDealing first with lack of jurisdiction *rationae personae,* resulting from the Egyptian nationality of the Claimants, the Respondent first observed that the Claimants\u2019 alleged loss of Egyptian nationality had been used as a *deus ex machina* to transform the domestic claims which Claimants had been pursuing into international claims. Formality over equity was the reality and substance of what the Claimants were now presenting to the Tribunal.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent suggested that the Claimants had opened their Counter Memorial with the statement that \"[the Nationality Law] means exactly what it says and may be applied in [a] straightforward fashion to the facts of this case.\" However, this approach was inconsistent with their contention that the timing of the acquisition of Lebanese nationality prior to submitting the application for permission was immaterial.\n\nMr Siag\n-------\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent analyzed Mr Siag\u2019s nationality based on the assumption that Mr Siag acquired his Lebanese nationality at birth. It was noted that when he applied to the Egyptian Minister of Interior, Mr Siag submitted a nationality certificate issued by the Lebanese Minister of Interior stating that \"[Mr Siag] has been a Lebanese national for over 10 years.\" The Respondent disagreed with the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of Article 10 of the Nationality Law whereby it was said to apply only to recognition of nationality in the eyes of Egyptian law. Such an interpretation would mean that the one-year declaration period under the third paragraph was triggered either on the existence of a \"formal expression\" of Lebanese nationality or, alternatively, on the date the Egyptian Minister of Interior granted permission under Article 10.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent emphasized that Article 10 dealt solely with those instances where a foreign nationality was acquired through naturalization following the grant of permission by the Egyptian Minister of Interior. As a Lebanese national by birth, the only part of Article 10 relevant to Mr Siag was the first paragraph of Article 10. Under this part of Article 10, Mr Siag must be considered as Egyptian in every respect and under all circumstances. The Respondent submitted that the writing of Dr Salama supported this view:\n\nThe provisions of Article 10 [...] stipulate that the renouncement of Egyptian nationality is conditional upon two requirements:\n\n**First Condition:** an individual must obtain a prior permission from the administrative authority. This condition is explicitly stipulated under the provision of Article 10, which provides that an Egyptian may not become naturalized \"except after obtaining a permission to do so from the Minister of Interior\" as stipulated in paragraph 2 of this Article that renouncement of the Egyptian nationality shall not occur \"so long as such person is permitted [...]\" to become naturalized and provided he has actually done so.\n\n[...]\n\nThe provision of Article 10 [...] stipulates that such permission must be obtained before naturalization and not after. Therefore, if such permission is issued thereafter, it would merely serve to confirm the reality, together with protecting the individual from being penalized by being divested of his Egyptian nationality as stipulated under Article 16(1).24\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 30.\n\n78.\n\nThe Claimant also asserted that Professor Riad\u2019s opinion was contradicted by one of his scholarly books where he made a distinction between acquisition of nationality by naturalization and by other means.\n\nMs Vecchi\n---------\n\n79.\n\nAs to Ms Vecchi, she acquired Egyptian nationality as described in the 1956 nationality law not in Article 7 of the Nationality Law. The Respondent referred to the articles in previous nationality laws prior to Article 8 of the Nationality Law. Article 14 of the 1958 nationality law provided the following:\n\nThis provision shall apply to a foreign woman who acquired Egyptian nationality pursuant to Articles 8 and 9 of the Presidential Decree issuing [the 1956 Law],\n\n80.\n\nSuch a sentence did not appear in Article 8. If the legislators had wished to cover the same \"factual situation\" as Article 7 they could have preserved this sentence.\n\n81.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent emphasized that under Article 1 of the Nationality Law, Ms Vecchi was an Egyptian and not a \"foreign woman\" for the purposes of Article 7. The Claimants\u2019 argument would result in classifying two groups; those women who had acquired Egyptian nationality on the basis of marriage under the 1958 nationality law and those women who had acquired Egyptian nationality under the 1956 nationality law. Only those who come under the 1956 nationality law could lose their Egyptian nationality. If a person did not come under Articles 6 and 7 of the Nationality Law they could utilize Article 10. Contrary to the opinion of Professor Riad such persons were, therefore, able to reacquire their former nationality.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent noted its agreement that a person\u2019s nationality should initially be determined by the laws of the State whose nationality is in question. However, it disagreed with what it described as the Claimants\u2019 attempts to divest nationality certificates of all value. The Respondent referred to a statement of Professor Schreuer that:\n\nA certificate of nationality will be treated as part of the \u2018documents or other evidence\u2019 to be examined by the Tribunal in accordance with Art. 43. Such a certificate will be given its appropriate weight but does not preclude a decision at variance with its contents.25\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2001), p. 268.\n\n83.\n\nThe amount of weight that should be given to nationality certificates depended on the prevailing circumstances and conditions under which the certificates were issued or obtained. The Respondent submitted that the factual situation in the **Soufraki** case differed from this case in that in **Soufraki** no Italian official undertook an inquiry to determine whether Mr Soufraki had lost his Italian nationality. Egypt\u2019s administrative practice was and is to undertake an investigation of the applicant\u2019s record. The relative weight of nationality certificates should be assessed based on the following twofold test:\n\ni. With respect to the investor the question relates to the circumstances under which he/she has obtained nationality certificates. Albeit in the absence of fraud on the part of the investor, the pertinent question becomes: has the latter obtain [sic] such certificate for the sole purpose of seeking recourse to ICSID?\n\nii. With respect to the concerned State, two questions are pertinent:\n\n(a) What are the circumstances under which the State issued its nationality certificates to the investor? In particular, is there evidence, even circumstantial, that the State was in fact attempting to be subject to ICSID by issuing nationality certificates to foreign investors?\n\n(b) What are the procedures followed by the State in issuing nationality certificates?26\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 54.\n\n84.\n\nThe overwhelming number of declarations and official documents issued to the Claimants evidencing their Egyptian nationality should be taken seriously.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent contested the Claimants\u2019 analysis of the *Champion Trading* decision as based on an assessment of Egypt\u2019s nationality laws and reaffirmed its contention that the decision \"has established an incontestable linkage between the *personal behavior* of the claimants (determined through the factual background and circumstances), on the one hand, and deciding the issue of nationality, on the other\"27 (emphasis in original). The Claimants\u2019 behaviour in setting up the Siag Touristic and Siag Taba companies and traveling extensively on Egyptian passports was relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s enquiry as to the nationality of the Claimants.\n\n*Id.* para. 63.\n\nExistence of an \"Investment\"\n----------------------------\n\n86.\n\nOn the subject of its objections to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* the Respondent submitted that although the term investment has a broad definition it is not without limitations and should be determined on a case by case basis. Foreign investment requires a placement of foreign capital in the host state under the complete or incomplete control of foreign investors. The purpose of the ICSID Convention is to afford a higher level of protection to foreign investors. The Respondent emphasized that the purpose of the ICSID Convention was the settlement of international disputes. That is, investments by foreign investors involving the flow of foreign private funds to the host State. It was submitted that ICSID cases involve at least one foreign element and differ from municipal economic activities. At the date Egypt and Italy concluded the BIT on 2 March 1989, and at the date of entering into the sale contract on 4 January 1989 the Claimants were Egyptian nationals. The two companies, Siag Touristic and Siag Taba were established under Egyptian laws. From their inception, the economic activities of the Claimants were devoid of any foreign element. By contrast, both the *Fedax* case and the *Tokios Tokeles* case referred to by the Claimants had involved a foreign element from the beginning.\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent continued to assert that, in any event, the Claimants should be estopped from bringing their claim before this Tribunal due to their attempting to \"have it both ways\" when it came to their assertions and denials of Egyptian nationality. It was a settled principle of international law that a person may not take advantage of a change of nationality to bring a claim where the investment in question was made using a former nationality. The Claimants obtained the benefits of Egyptian nationality in making their investments and so should be estopped from bringing a claim based on their Italian nationality. The enquiry should be at the time of the investment not the time of the injury when assessing whether a claimant was seeking to take advantage of inconsistent rights afforded by multiple nationalities.\n\n88.\n\nFinally, the Respondent set forth its request for relief in identical terms to those in its Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n**D. The Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 4 August 2006. The principal arguments made in the Rejoinder are summarized below in paragraphs 90 to 102 below.\n\n90.\n\nIn their Rejoinder the Claimants reiterated that the case law of the Egyptian courts was clear that documentary evidence of nationality is **prima facie** evidence only. The most recent decision of the Supreme Administrative Court on 25 June 2005 held that it was \"well settled jurisprudence that the Egyptian nationality is a legal status determined pursuant to the dictates of the applicable Egyptian nationality laws.\"28 The Claimants submitted that the Respondent had chosen to ignore this well-settled jurisprudence and had not even commented on the six decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court which Claimants had referred to in their Counter-Memorial. In terms of ICSID practice, both the *Soufraki* and *Champion Trading* cases reinforced the established principle that nationality was determined by application of the terms of the relevant nationality law and documents evidencing nationality were **prima facie** evidence only.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Legal Authority 92, p. 4.\n\nMr Siag\n-------\n\n91.\n\nAs to Article 10 of the Nationality Law, its purpose was to provide the legal framework by which an Egyptian may seek to have his/her foreign nationality recognized and to determine the impact of that event upon the person\u2019s Egyptian nationality. With respect to the Respondent\u2019s contention that it was important whether Mr Siag acquired his Lebanese nationality \"voluntarily\" or \"involuntarily\" this was in fact irrelevant. In any event, Egypt chose to invoke Article 10 when it received Mr Siag\u2019s application in December 1989 and could not now credibly argue that it was inapplicable. When it invoked Article 10 it did so in the belief that Mr Siag had acquired his Lebanese nationality at birth i.e. \"involuntarily.\"\n\n92.\n\nOn the question of the satisfaction of the third paragraph of Article 10 by an \"implied declaration,\" it was submitted that the passage from the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decision of 10 December 2000 provided no support for Dr El Haddad\u2019s contention that the declaration requirement may be satisfied by an \"implied\" or an \"assumed\" declaration. The Claimants recited Article 20 of the Nationality Law which provides that \"[declarations, notifications, documents and applications stipulated under this Law shall be addressed to the Minister of Interior or whomever he delegates in this regard, and issued on the forms determined by virtue of a decree from the Minister of Interior.\" The Claimants concluded that the declaration under Article 10 must be a formal declaration.\n\n93.\n\nAs a matter of law Article 10 applied both to nationalities acquired voluntarily through naturalization and involuntarily such as at birth. It was contended that the Respondent\u2019s argument would discriminate between Egyptians, which is impermissible under the Egyptian Constitution. Furthermore, there was nothing in the text of Article 10 to suggest that a person who acquires a foreign nationality involuntarily cannot apply under Article 10. This was reflected in the form from the Egyptian Ministry of Interior filled out by Mr Siag. It had a notation \"date acquired\" and Mr Siag wrote \"from birth.\" This did not prevent the Ministry from processing Mr Siag\u2019s application. The passages from scholars relied upon by the Respondent, including Professor Riad, did not support its argument. All that they stood for was the unremarkable proposition that \"an Egyptian who \u2018involuntarily\u2019 possesses a foreign nationality and does not seek to have such foreign nationality recognized under the provisions of Article 10 should not be stripped of his Egyptian nationality based solely on his failure to seek permission to acquire such foreign nationality under Article 10.\"29\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 60.\n\n94.\n\nThe date of and the manner of Mr Siag\u2019s acquisition of Lebanese nationality continued to be an area of contention between the parties. The Claimants summarized Mr Siag\u2019s acquisition of Lebanese nationality and the documents submitted in evidence as follows. Mr Siag acquired Lebanese nationality by naturalization in December 1989. There was no evidence from the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo to suggest that Mr Siag acquired Lebanese nationality at birth. Mr Siag was born of Lebanese origin because his ancestors on his father\u2019s side of the family had been Lebanese. It was submitted that the documents relied upon by Egypt to demonstrate that Mr Siag acquired his Lebanese nationality at birth were inconclusive. Mr Siag wrote the words \"at birth\" on his application for permission, dated 19 December 1989, for the reference to the date he \"acquired\" Lebanese nationality. He understood this to be a reference to his Lebanese origin. Similarly, the notation on his individual record \"more than ten years\" showed that he came from an \"original\" Lebanese family. Finally, the letter to Mr Siag from the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo of 19 December 1989 had been mistranslated by Egypt. It states \"was born in Cairo on 12 March 1962, and he is of Lebanese nationality and registered in the records of this mission\" not \"was born in Cairo on 12 March 1962, of Lebanese nationality and recorded in the registers of this mission.\" In addition, the Respondent made a request to the Lebanese Embassy for documents proving Mr Siag acquired Lebanese nationality at birth and evidence of his father\u2019s Lebanese nationality. The Lebanese Embassy responded that it had no such evidence.\n\nMs Vecchi\n---------\n\n95.\n\nAs to Ms Vecchi, the Claimants contended that the Respondent\u2019s suggestion that there was a difference between the terms of the 1956 nationality law and the 1958 nationality law was misplaced. The two applicable provisions were identical. Likewise, as stated in the Counter-Memorial and the Expert Opinion of Professor Riad, Article 1 of the Nationality Law was only meant to address who were \"original\" Egyptians prior to the establishment of the United Arab Republic.\n\n96.\n\nIt was submitted that the Nationality Law was a matter of \"public order.\" Therefore, it was immediately applicable to all Egyptians without discrimination. It was not possible for the Nationality Law to apply only to those women who acquired the Egyptian nationality of their husbands after 1975. Moreover, the prior nationality laws of 1956 and 1958 contained the same provisions as Articles 7 and 8 of the Nationality Law.\n\n97.\n\nIn relation to the Respondent\u2019s contention that the legislators could have retained a similar sentence to that found in Article 14 of the 1958 nationality law, the Claimants asserted that this argument was misplaced. The reason for the sentence being in the 1958 law had been explained by Professor Riad. He stated that it was there because the 1958 law established nationality in the United Arab Republic. This need was not there when the Nationality Law was enacted in 1975.\n\n98.\n\nThe Claimants then asserted that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation and application of its nationality law in this case constituted an abuse of rights under international law. The Respondent had inconsistently applied its nationality law for the sole purpose of evading its international obligations.\n\n99.\n\nOn the procedural matter of the burden of proof the Claimants submitted that the Respondent bore the burden of proof with respect to each of its jurisdictional objections. Claimants relied upon the opinion of Professor W Michael Reisman30 that stated \"Egypt, as the party advancing the objections to jurisdiction following a *prima facie* showing by the Claimants, bears the burden to prove their elements.\"31\n\nMyres S McDougal Professor of International Law at Yale Law School.\n\nProf W Michael Reisman\u2019s Opinion of 31 July 2006, para. 5\n\n*Ratione Materiae* Objections\n-----------------------------\n\n100.\n\nTurning to the *ratione materiae* objections the Claimants submitted that the terms of the ICSID Convention and the BIT were relevant. The drafters of the ICSID Convention intentionally left the term \"investment\" undefined. The BIT in this case contained a very broad definition of \"investment.\" The Claimants reiterated that the reading in of an origin of capital requirement has been firmly rejected in ICSID practice. It was submitted that the Respondent\u2019s attempt to distinguish the *Fedax* and *Tokios Tokeles* cases on the basis that the economic activities in question possessed a foreign element from the very beginning were not of assistance. This difference was immaterial to the propositions expressed in those cases concerning the definition of investment and an origin of capital requirement. The Respondent\u2019s argument that the investments were never controlled by a foreign investor was also challenged. The Claimants submitted that Mr Siag and Ms Vecchi acquired Italian nationality on 3 May 1993 and 14 September 1993 respectively. The vast majority of the money they invested was invested from 1994 onwards.\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimants repeated their contention that the Respondent\u2019s estoppel argument was not a jurisdictional issue and should be part of the merits stage of these proceedings. In any event, the claim was baseless. The Claimants never attempted to conceal their Italian nationality or deliberately failed to disclose their loss of Egyptian nationality. There was also no evidence that the Claimants wilfully manipulated their nationality. Their acquisition of Italian nationality was unrelated to these proceedings.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 request for relief remained the same as in the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n**E. The Hearing on 8-9 August 2006**\n-------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nAt the hearing on 8-9 August 2006 no witnesses were called for cross-examination. Each side made oral presentation of its respective case and responded to questions from the Tribunal. The presentations closely followed the written submissions discussed above and to avoid undue repetition the following analysis is a brief summary only.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Arguments\n--------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent noted that there were two ways to approach the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, namely the literal approach and the contextual approach. It was submitted that the contextual approach, taking into account the objectives of these instruments, was the preferred approach. Turning to the Nationality Law the object was to encourage Egyptians to maintain their Egyptian nationality and so their links to Egypt if they acquired another foreign nationality through migration to another country. This was reflected in the first paragraph of Article 10 which stated that if permission was not granted by the Egyptian Minister of Interior to acquire a foreign nationality the person retained their Egyptian nationality.\n\n105.\n\nIt was suggested that there was no unanimity of opinion among scholars as to the requirement to make a declaration under the third paragraph of Article 10 within the one year period following the grant of permission. The trend of legal scholarship was towards not requiring a declaration within the one year period once permission had been granted. It was also submitted that the decisions of the Egyptian courts were not unanimous on the one year requirement under Article 10(3). Counsel for the Respondent mentioned four cases that it said supported that trend. (After hearing the submissions of both parties the Respondent was granted permission to produce these four cases and a post-hearing submission.)\n\n106.\n\nThere was not a consistent line of court decisions and it was the consistent practice of the Egyptian Ministry of Interior not to require the declaration. However, no evidence to this latter effect was produced. It was also claimed that there was no official form for the declaration.\n\n107.\n\nWhere a person applied to the Egyptian Minister of Interior under Article 10 for an already acquired foreign nationality what was actually being sought was recognition of that foreign nationality. If that person was permitted to maintain his Egyptian nationality that was the end of the matter and no further action was required. It was immaterial whether Mr Siag had been born Lebanese or became naturalized as a Lebanese. He did not get prior permission to acquire that Lebanese nationality and so under the first paragraph of Article 10 he remained Egyptian.\n\n108.\n\nWith respect to Ms Vecchi, she was not covered by Article 8 of the Nationality Law since pursuant to Article 1 she is not to be considered a \"foreign woman.\" Moreover, when she reacquired her Italian nationality Ms Vecchi did nothing to inform the Egyptian Ministry of Interior. Article 10 would apply and she has never sought permission under that article.\n\n109.\n\nOn the burden of proof it was said that this was covered by Article 24 of the Nationality Law which provided that \"the onus of proof of nationality shall be borne by whoever upholds or alleges not carrying Egyptian nationality.\" In short, he or she who asserts must prove.\n\n110.\n\nThe Respondent accepted that the definition of \"investment\" was undefined in the ICSID Convention. However, consistent with its earlier written submissions, it was contended that there must be some foreign element. The Respondent maintained its contention that the purpose and objectives of the ICSID Convention required an origin of capital requirement. It was acknowledged that such a view was the opposite to the view reached by a number of ICSID tribunals. In those cases, though, the economic activity comprised at least one foreign element from its inception. To include the Claimants\u2019 investment under the protection of the ICSID Convention would expand the scope of international investment protection to include what were municipal economic activities.\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent reiterated that its estoppel claim could be considered at the jurisdictional phase although it was acknowledged that it did not form part of the tests set out in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. As to the substance of its estoppel claim, the Respondent asserted that the Claimants had derived benefits based on the belief that they were Egyptians and it was inequitable for them to now base claims on the fact such nationality had been lost.\n\n112.\n\nAs to the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Respondent has committed an abuse of rights under international law the Respondent submitted that it was entitled to take the position it had taken on interpretation of the Nationality Law and that the opinion of Professor Reisman was unbalanced and biased.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 Arguments\n------------------------\n\n113.\n\nOn the issue of nationality it was contended that the Claimants had provided unrebutted *prima facie* proof of the positive nationality requirement, Italian nationality, at the time the claim was filed and registered. The Claimants also satisfied the negative nationality requirement.\n\n114.\n\nMr Siag lost his Egyptian nationality through the operation of Egyptian law when he failed to make a declaration within the one year period stipulated in the third paragraph of Article 10. This view was supported by the premier Egyptian expert on the Nationality Law, Professor Riad and the Egyptian courts. Article 10 concerned the recognition of a foreign nationality by Egypt and the determination of whether Egypt will give such nationality some legal effect in Egypt. It was acknowledged by Respondent\u2019s experts that Article 10 could be utilized irrespective of whether or not the nationality was acquired before or after permission was sought. It also applied irrespective of whether the nationality was acquired voluntarily or involuntarily.\n\n115.\n\nThe first paragraph of Article 10 did state that a person who acquired a foreign nationality without obtaining permission retains their Egyptian nationality. However, there is discretion under Article 16 to also strip that person of their Egyptian nationality. Although it was contended that it was not an issue, the Claimants submitted that Mr Siag acquired his Lebanese nationality through naturalization not at birth.\n\n116.\n\nIt was the view of Professor Riad that when permission is granted for an already acquired foreign nationality that there should be a formal expression, such as making an application for and receiving a passport, after the permission is granted. The view of the Respondent\u2019s experts Professors El Haddad and Abdel Aal that the one-year period starts when permission is granted was noted. The Claimants submitted that on either calculation there was no declaration made within the one year period. Article 20 of the Nationality Law set out the requirements for declarations and it was clear that these requirements applied to the declaration requirement under Article 10.\n\n117.\n\nIt was submitted that extrinsic evidence of nationality was *prima facie* evidence only. Such was the holding of Egypt\u2019s Supreme Administrative Court and also other ICSID tribunals. However, such evidence is irrelevant if inconsistent with an application of the relevant law.\n\n118.\n\nWith respect to Ms Vecchi\u2019s nationality it was contended that she gained her Egyptian nationality exactly in the manner described in Article 7 of the Nationality Law except that it was under the relevant article of the prior nationality law, which was worded identically. It was submitted that the Nationality Law applied to Ms Vecchi but, even if it did not, she lost her Egyptian nationality in any event through the operation of the prior nationality law.\n\n119.\n\nThe Claimants summarized their claim that there had been an abuse of rights under international law. It was asserted that the Respondent was not allowed under international law to apply its laws arbitrarily so as to evade jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.\n\n120.\n\nAs to the Respondent\u2019s estoppel claim, the Claimants reiterated their primary argument that this claim should properly be dealt with as part of the determination of the merits of the dispute. In any event, it was denied that the Claimants concealed their Italian nationality from Egypt or in any way had behaved inequitably. The detriment relied upon by Egypt of being held to the stricter standards of investment protection under international law was also questioned.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimants maintained that the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* were without merit. The Claimants had stated that they invested US$20 million in the Taba project in their personal capacities. In any event, it made no difference if the Claimants\u2019 funds were channeled through the two companies formed for the purpose of the investment.\n\n122.\n\nThere was no origin of capital requirement or any requirement that part of the funds invested should be from Italy. The suggestion to the contrary derived no support from the terms of the ICSID Convention, the BIT or the decisions of ICSID Tribunals. No ICSID tribunal had held that the ICSID Convention requires a foreign origin of capital.\n\n123.\n\nThe Claimants disagreed with the argument raised by the Respondent that the Claimants were Egyptian nationals in 1989 when the BIT was entered into and that was the time that mattered. The Claimants investments were made between 1994 and 1996 after they acquired Italian nationality and lost Egyptian nationality. The acts of Egypt that were complained of also occurred after the Claimants acquired Italian nationality.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimants contended that any legitimate expectations that they were Egyptian nationals were not relevant to determining the issue of nationality. This issue was a matter of public order to be determined by the application of Egyptian law. The *Champion Trading* and *Soufraki* Tribunals had ruled to this effect.\n\n125.\n\nOn the relevance of the abuse of rights argument, it was submitted that this set an outer limit on what the Respondent could argue in this proceeding. It was also relevant to the determination of costs of the jurisdiction phase. In response to a question raised by Professor Vicu\u00f1a concerning the relevance of continuity of nationality it was submitted that on the facts of this case the Claimants acquired their Italian nationality prior to the time that the vast majority of the investment was made and well before the acts which were the subject of the complaint. Also, for the purposes of jurisdiction the only two dates that mattered were those dates set out in the ICSID Convention.\n\n126.\n\nAs to the matters raised concerning the Claimants\u2019 Italian and Lebanese nationality it was argued that the matter of positive nationality was closed. The Claimants had made a *prima facie* showing of Italian nationality in their Memorial on the Merits and that had not been rebutted by the Respondent. Nor had Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality been debated. All that had been raised was whether he acquired such nationality at birth or by naturalization. This was a question of fact under Egyptian law in terms of Article 10.\n\n127.\n\nOn the matter of interpretation of the international instruments involved in this case it was submitted that the Tribunal should give deference to the negotiated language of the treaty, including how Egypt and Italy chose to define \"natural person\" and \"protected investment.\" The Tribunal should not rewrite the BIT to achieve policy ends. If it did so, the Tribunal would be replacing its judgment for that of the Contracting States.\n\n**F. Post-Hearing Submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission\n----------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s ruling at the jurisdictional hearing, the Respondent filed a post-hearing submission dated 29 August 2006.\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent first discussed the alleged date of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality. The Respondent argued that the Claimants had retreated from the \"at birth\" statement on Mr Siag\u2019s application and now contended that he acquired Lebanese nationality in December 1989 through naturalization.\n\n130.\n\nIn any case, it was submitted that it was accepted that Mr Siag acquired Lebanese nationality prior to his application for permission. This was decisive to the applicability of Article 10(3) and was supported by the decision of the Egyptian courts in a recent case (the *Lakah* case referred to below).\n\n131.\n\nIt was submitted that the two decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court of 21 December 2002 and 10 December 200032 submitted by the Claimants on the application of Article 10(3) of the Nationality Law did not in fact provide any guidance as to its application. The 2000 decision (the *Saleh* case) merely stated what the Article said and the 2002 decision related to a different factual situation. The Respondent submitted that the most recent relevant decision of the Supreme Administrative Court was a decision rendered on 27 August 2001.33 This case concerned a Mr Raymond Lakah, a dual-national of Egypt and France. The Respondent submitted that it could be inferred from the Court\u2019s decision that Mr Lakah held French nationality prior to seeking permission under Article 10, that he made no declaration within the one-year period, and that the Court did not investigate any formal expression of French nationality once permission was granted.\n\n*See supra,* para. 54.\n\nRulings Nos. 5329 and 5344 of Judicial Year 47 [hereinafter the *Lakah* case].\n\n132.\n\nThe Respondent also provided two further decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court34 which, although not touching on the interpretation of Article 10, were said to illustrate the objective of the Nationality Law.35\n\nRulings Nos. 1648 and 1960 of Judicial Year 47 issued by the First Circuit of the Higher Administrative Court on 6 November 2000.\n\n*Id.*\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Submission\n--------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Post-Hearing submission on 11 September 2006.\n\n134.\n\nAs to the decision of the Supreme Administrative of 10 December 2000 in the *Saleh* case, the Claimants said that Mr Saleh lost his Egyptian nationality because the steps required by Article 10 were not followed. Although he made a declaration within the one-year period, he had not in fact been granted the requisite permission by the Egyptian Minister of Interior. The Supreme Administrative Court emphasized and explained the requirement to obtain permission from the Egyptian Minister of Interior and then to make a declaration within one year from the date of acquisition of the foreign nationality. The Claimants submitted that the Respondent\u2019s attempt to distinguish this case was unavailing since Mr Siag\u2019s situation (permission granted but no declaration) was explicitly addressed by the Court. Similarly, the Respondent\u2019s attempt to distinguish the December 2002 Supreme Administrative Court decision as one concerning a minor failed to acknowledge that a minor\u2019s Egyptian nationality is directly linked to the declaration made by the father under Article 10(3).\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimants asserted that the three new judgments submitted by the Respondent were unrelated to Article 10(3) and noted that they were unaccompanied by any further expert opinion. The *Lakah* case raised interesting constitutional questions but shed no light on the interpretation of Article 10(3). The inferences the Respondent sought to draw from a brief passage of the judgment were groundless. There was simply no analysis of Mr Lakah\u2019s Egyptian nationality under Article 10. As to the other two cases submitted by the Respondent, the Respondent had acknowledged that they did not touch upon the declaration requirement under Article 10.36\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 28.\n\n136.\n\nIn its post-hearing submission the Claimant also objected to the Respondent\u2019s post-hearing submission on the grounds that it made submissions that went beyond the areas that the Tribunal directed. The Claimants requested the Tribunal to disregard all submissions made by the Respondent in its Post-Hearing Submission that were not in compliance with the directions made by the Tribunal at the jurisdictional hearing. As noted above, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to rule on this objection.\n\n**IV. EXAMINATION OF THE PARTIES\u2019 SUBMISSIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nUnder Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules the Tribunal is required to decide the Respondent\u2019s objection that the present dispute \"is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal.\" The Claimants contend that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is established under two instruments referred to at the outset of this Decision: (a) the BIT and (b) the ICSID Convention.\n\n138.\n\nOn the burden of proof, the Respondent asserted that despite the fact that it had raised the objections to jurisdiction in this case, the burden of proof lay with the Claimants to prove they were not Egyptian nationals at the relevant times. The Respondent relied upon Article 24 of the Nationality Law which provides \"the onus of proof of nationality shall be borne by whoever upholds or alleges not carrying Egyptian nationality.\"37 The Tribunal does not agree that this Article extends to the burden of proof for what are jurisdictional objections asserted by the Respondent.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 46. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 6.\n\n139.\n\nAs regards the burden of proof on the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal adopts the test proffered by Judge Higgins, President of the International Court of Justice, in her separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms Case38* The principle proposed by Judge Higgins was the following:\n\nThe Court should [...] see if, on the facts as alleged by [Claimant], the [Respondent\u2019s] actions complained of might violate the Treaty articles (\u00a7 33) [...] Nothing in this approach puts at risk the obligation of the Court to keep separate the jurisdictional and merits phases [...] and to protect the integrity of the proceedings on the merits [...] what is for the merits, (and which remains pristine and untouched by this approach to the jurisdictional issue) is to determine what exactly the facts are, whether as finally determined they do sustain a violation of [the treaty] and if so, whether there is a defence to that violation [...]. In short it is at the merits that one sees \"whether there really has been a breach.\"\n\nCase concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America), 1996, ICJ Reports 803, 810).\n\n140.\n\nThis principle has been followed by a number of international arbitration tribunals deciding jurisdictional objections by a respondent state against a claimant investor. The Tribunal in the case of *Plama Consortium Limited v Republic of Bulgaria39* stated that it did not understand that Judge Higgins\u2019 approach was in any sense controversial. In the *Salini v Jordan40* case, referred to in *Plama Consortium,* the Tribunal stated:\n\nIn considering issues of jurisdiction, courts and tribunals do not go into the merits of the case without sufficient prior debate. In conformity with this jurisprudence, the Tribunal will accordingly seek to determine whether the facts alleged by the Claimant in this case, if established, are capable of coming within those provisions of the BIT which have been invoked.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, 20 ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 262 (2005), para. 119\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.p.A and Italstrade S.p.A v The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, Award, 15 November 2004, para. 151.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with this approach and applies it to the jurisdictional issues considered below.\n\n**A. Alleged Lack of Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Personae***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nIt is common ground between the parties that under Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention there is a positive and negative nationality requirement. It is important to stress that the Claimants assertion that they held Italian nationality at the relevant times so as to satisfy the positive nationality under Article 25 of the Convention has not been contested by the Respondent.41 Rather, the Respondent\u2019s *ratione personae* objections to jurisdiction focus on the negative requirement. That is, were the Claimants, at the relevant times under Article 25, nationals of the Host State, Egypt, and so barred from bringing their claim before ICSID under the ICSID Convention?\n\nAlthough the Respondent does in passing question the strength of the Claimants\u2019 connections with Italy in its Reply, when responding to Professor Reisman\u2019s Opinion that the Claimants\u2019 Italian nationality was acquired for *bona fide* reasons and that there was no room for an application of effective nationality principles since this was not a case of dual-nationality.\n\n143.\n\nIt is well established that the domestic laws of each Contracting State determine nationality. This has been accepted in ICSID practice.42 Both parties accepted and followed this general principle of international law in their submissions and at the hearing.43 Thus, Egypt\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction at paragraph 21 describes it as \"indisputable.\" Claimants\u2019 Counter Memorial refers to Articles 1 and 2 of the 1930 Hague Convention (\"the Hague Convention\") and the 1997 European Convention on Nationality, Article 3(1) as examples of international conventions reflecting the international law principles. Although it never became effective, the Hague Convention is often referred to as reflecting the current international law principles on nationality of individuals. Article 1 states:\n\nIt is for each State to determine under its laws who are its nationals. This law shall be recognised by other States in so far as it is consistent with international conventions, international custom, and the principles of law generally recognized with regard to nationality.\n\n*See Soufraki, supra* note 6.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s opening, Transcript, Day 1, p. 30 (\"nationality is of public order - I think this is in agreement - and is determined by Egyptian law\").\n\n144.\n\nArticle 1 identifies that international law sets limits on the power of a state to confer nationality.44 The relevance of international law to the state\u2019s determination of nationality under its municipal law as recognised in Article 1 of the Hague Convention is described in Oppenheim\u2019s International Law as follows:\n\nThis permits of some control of exorbitant attributions by states of their nationality, by depriving them of much of their international effect. Such control is needed since, although the grant of nationality is for each state to decide for itself in accordance with its own laws, the consequences as against other states of this unilateral act occur on the international plane and are to be determined by international law.45\n\nIan Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, 6 ed., p. 377.\n\nOppenheim\u2019s International Law, (Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts eds., 9 ed.), p. 853.\n\n145.\n\nIn the context of the settlement of investment disputes under the terms of the ICSID Convention, Professor Schreuer comments:\n\nWhether a person is a nation of a particular State is determined, in the first place, by the law of the State whose nationality is claimed [...]. But an international tribunal is not bound by the national law in question under all circumstances. Situations where nationality provisions of national law may be disregarded include cases of ineffective nationality lacking a genuine link between the State and the individual. Other instances where national rules need not be followed are certain situations of involuntary acquisition of nationality in violation of international law or cases of withdrawal of nationality that are contrary to international law.46\n\n*Id.* p. 267.\n\n146.\n\nThe international law rule that the municipal law of the state determines nationality is also reflected in the BIT. Article 1(3) of the BIT provides: \"The term \u2018natural person\u2019 shall mean, with respect to either Contracting State, a natural person holding the nationality of that State in accordance with its laws \" (underlining added).\n\n147.\n\nThe Parties in their written and oral submissions both placed primary emphasis on the interpretation of the Egyptian nationality law to determine whether the Claimants were Egyptian nationals at the relevant time and so did not satisfy the negative nationality test. However, in its Reply the Respondent made reference to the question of effective nationality47 but this was in response to the opinion of Professor Reisman that since the Claimants were not dual-nationals by operation of the Nationality Law, questions of effectiveness of nationality did not arise. The Claimants acknowledged that there was scope for the Tribunal to take into account international law on nationality.48 The applicability of the concept of effective or dominant nationality is discussed further below.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 8 (\"there is no evidence that either Waguih or Clorinda has the type of connections with Italy that would permit a finding of effective nationality under international law\"); and para. 9 (\"Egypt is not required under international law to arbitrate investment with persons who have non-existen[t], spurious or insubstantial links to the State of which they may be formally nationals\").\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 157. For example, Counsel for the Claimants noted that the Tribunal is fully entitled to consider whether Egypt\u2019s application of its nationality law is objectionable as a matter of international law (although this was in the context of the abuse of rights doctrine).\n\nDocuments of Egyptian Nationality *Prima Facie* Evidence Only\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions the Respondent referred to several official documents from the Egyptian Interior Ministry as reflecting that Mr Siag had in fact retained his Egyptian nationality after 1990 and through to the present date. These documents included letters from the Ministry, as well as passport, and company documents relating to the investment in Taba.\n\n149.\n\nClaimants asserted that as a matter of Egyptian law the determination of Egyptian nationality was a matter of public order. Article 6 of the Egyptian Constitution of 1971 states that \"the Egyptian nationality is regulated by the law.\"49 As such, It could only be determined by application of the Nationality Law. Such an approach has also been confirmed by Egypt\u2019s Administrative Court of 28 December 1965 where in a decision cited by the Claimants it was stated that \"whereas the establishment of the nationality of a person is determined exclusively by the provisions of the legislation regulating the nationality, all data in documents even official have no legal value in proving the Egyptian nationality.\"50\n\nThis was also confirmed by Professor El Haddad in her Supplemental Expert Opinion, para. 51 (\"the loss and acquisition of Egyptian nationality is a matter that is not subject to the will of the concerned parties but remains governed by imperative legal rules that must be applied irrespective of the stance of individuals towards such rules\").\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 21 (referring to para. 39 of Prof Dr Riad\u2019s Expert Opinion). Claimants also referred to five other decisions of the Egyptian courts, which came to the same conclusion.\n\n150.\n\nThis has also been the practice of other ICSID Tribunals. In the *Soufraki* case the Tribunal was urged to accept the finding of the Italian Government that Mr Soufraki had Italian nationality. The Tribunal ruled as follows:\n\nIt is accepted within international law that nationality is within the domestic jurisdiction of the State, which settles, by its own legislation, the rules relating to the acquisition (and loss) of its nationality. Article 1(3) of the BIT reflects this rule. But it is no less accepted that when, in international arbitral or judicial proceedings, the nationality of a person is challenged, the international tribunal is competent to pass upon that challenge. It will accord great weight to the nationality law of the State in question and to the interpretation and application of that law by its authorities. But it will in the end decide for itself whether, on the facts and the law before it, the person whose nationality is at issue was or was not a national of the State in question and when, and what follows from that finding. Where, as in the instant case, the jurisdiction of an international tribunal turns on an issue of nationality, the international tribunal is empowered, indeed bound, to decide that issue.51\n\n*Soufraki, supra* note 6, para. 55.\n\n151.\n\nAs to the evidential weight to be accorded to certificates of nationality and other official documents the *Soufraki* Tribunal found that these were *prima facie* evidence of nationality only and said:\n\nThe Tribunal will, of course, accept Claimant\u2019s Certificates of Nationality as *\"prima facie\"* evidence. We agree with Professor Schreuer that:\n\nA certificate of nationality will be treated as part of the \"documents or other evidence\" to be examined by the Tribunal in accordance with Art. 43 [of the Convention], Such a certificate will be given its appropriate weight but does not preclude a decision at variance with its contents.52\n\n*Id.* para. 63.\n\n152.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent urged the Tribunal to take into account the cumulative effect of the number of documents evidencing the Egyptian nationality of the Claimants that were in existence throughout the 1990s and up until the Request for Arbitration was filed in 2005. However, the Respondent did not present any arguments to counter the expert opinion of Professor Riad and the decisions of Egyptian courts that under Egyptian law such documents were *prima facie* evidence of nationality only and should be disregarded if they were inconsistent with the applicable law.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine the nationality of the Claimants.53 Application of international law principles requires an application of the Egyptian nationality laws with reference to international law as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Both Egyptian law and the practice of international tribunals is that the documents referred to by the Respondent evidencing the nationality of the Claimants are *prima facie* evidence only. While such documents are relevant they do not alleviate the requirement on the Tribunal to apply the Egyptian nationality law, which is the only means of determining Egyptian nationality.\n\nArticle 41 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nMr Waguih Elie George Siag - Background\n---------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nMr Siag was born in Egypt on 12 March 1962 to Egyptian parents. He was, therefore, an Egyptian national from birth. On 19 December 1989, Mr Siag submitted an application for permission to acquire Lebanese nationality under Article 10 of the Nationality Law. Prior to submitting his application Mr Siag received a nationality certificate from the Lebanese Ministry of Interior on 15 December 1989 and a letter from the Lebanese Consulate in Cairo that he was \"of Lebanese nationality and recorded in the registers of this mission.\" On 5 March 1990, the Egyptian Minister of Interior issued his Decree No. 1353 of 1990 acknowledging Mr Siag\u2019s prior acquisition of Lebanese nationality and granting him permission to maintain his Egyptian nationality. On 8 March 1990 the Nationality Authority issued a letter to the Military Conscription Department to exempt Mr Siag from performing compulsory military service on the basis of his having dual-nationality. Mr Siag obtained a Lebanese passport on 14 June 1990. Mr Siag acquired Italian nationality on 3 May 1993 by decree of the Italian Minister of Interior. This was obtained on the basis of his marriage to an Italian citizen and the provisions of Article 5 of the Italian nationality law Number 91 of 1992. Mr Siag received an Italian passport on 12 July 1995, and remains a citizen of Italy at the present time.\n\n155.\n\nIn his application for permission to acquire Lebanese nationality Mr Siag sought permission to maintain his Egyptian nationality pursuant to the third paragraph of Article 10 of the Nationality Law. The third paragraph of Article 10 contains a requirement, once permission to maintain Egyptian nationality is granted, to further notify the Egyptian Interior Ministry within the period of one year of the desire to retain Egyptian nationality.\n\nEgyptian Nationality Law\n------------------------\n\n*Applicability of Article 10 of the Nationality Law - Voluntary/lnvoluntary Acquisition of Foreign Nationality - Acquisition Prior to Seeking Permission*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent contended that since Mr Siag acquired his Lebanese nationality prior to seeking permission under Article 10 of the Nationality Law, Article 10 was, in fact, not applicable to Mr Siag.54 In this respect Respondent made detailed submissions devoted to the issue of the accuracy of the documentation that Mr Siag submitted to the Egyptian Interior Ministry and to the categorization of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality as either voluntary in the sense that it was acquired through naturalization or involuntarily in that it was acquired at birth through application of *jus sanguinis.*\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 49. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 17.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it is unnecessary for the purpose of this ruling on jurisdiction to determine whether Mr Siag acquired his Lebanese nationality voluntarily or involuntarily. The Tribunal accepts the evidence of Professor Riad that the Nationality Law does not differentiate between involuntary and voluntary acquisition of a foreign nationality in the application of Article 10.55 Professor Riad served on the commission of legal experts who drafted the Nationality Law for the Egyptian Parliament. He also served on the commission that drafted Egypt\u2019s previous nationality law of 1956 for the Egyptian Parliament. The Tribunal concurs with the Claimants that Professor Riad is in a unique position to be able to comment on the application of Egypt\u2019s nationality laws and is properly regarded as the leading Egyptian authority on the Nationality Law.\n\nProfessor Riad\u2019s opinion was that this categorization may play a part under the application of Article 16 which concerns the stripping of Egyptian nationality when an Egyptian national acquires a foreign nationality without permission but had no relevance to the operation of Article 10.\n\n158.\n\nAt the time Mr Siag applied for permission to acquire Lebanese nationality in December 1989 he already possessed Lebanese nationality. The Respondent asserted that Article 10 of the Nationality Law only applied to situations where the foreign nationality had not yet been acquired. Therefore, pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 10 Mr Siag was considered to be an Egyptian in every respect and under all circumstances.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal adopts the opinions of Professor Riad that Article 10 addresses the recognition of foreign nationality in the \"eyes of Egypt.\" The view of Professor Riad was that the prior acquisition of a foreign nationality under the law of a foreign state made no difference to the permission sought under Article 10.56 Article 10 was \"blind\"57 to the operation of the foreign law. Under international law, as noted above, the conferral of a foreign nationality is a matter for the domestic law of the foreign state. The Tribunal upholds the Claimants\u2019 assertion that the Nationality Law was concerned with the recognition of that foreign nationality as a matter of Egyptian law and so Article 10 applies in the case of a person seeking permission under Article 10 for a foreign nationality that they already possess.58\n\nThis was also the view of Professor Salama, referred to in Egypt\u2019s Reply, para. 30: \"Therefore, if such permission is issued thereafter, it would merely serve to confirm the reality, together with protecting the individual from being penalized by being divested of his Egyptian nationality as stipulated under Article 16(1).\"\n\n*See* Expert Opinion of Prof Dr Riad of 10 July 2006, para. 31, and his supplementary Opinion of 1 August 2006, para. 5. Any such discrimination would, as explained by Professor Riad, be contrary to the Egyptian Constitution, which strictly requires that all Egyptians be treated equally under the law.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, para. 57. *See also* Supplementary Expert Opinion of Prof Dr El Haddad, para. 17, where it was conceded, at least in the case of a nationality acquired through naturalization, that a person may apply to the Egyptian Minister of Interior for permission despite having already acquired the nationality of the foreign country.\n\n160.\n\nThis view of the interpretation of Article 10 is also reinforced by the application form of the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior. This form includes a section that asks applicants to indicate that date on which foreign nationality \"was acquired.\"59 Mr Siag\u2019s application form under this section was noted \"at birth.\" Despite this notation which clearly indicated Mr Siag had already acquired his Lebanese nationality, the Egyptian Ministry of Interior proceeded to grant Mr Siag permission under Article 10.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, para. 11.\n\n161.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that Article 10 may be used to seek permission for an already acquired foreign nationality. In that case, though, the determining date for the commencement of the one year period under the third paragraph of Article 10 would not be the date of the acquisition of the foreign nationality. As Professor Riad stated:\n\nIn terms of applying Article 10, the date that should be considered for purposes of the third paragraph of Article 10 is the first date on which there was a formal expression of Mr Siag\u2019s foreign nationality after the issuance of the Minister\u2019s authorization to acquire the foreign nationality, for it is only at that point in time that Egyptian law acknowledged Mr Siag\u2019s acquisition of the foreign nationality.60\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Dr Riad of 10 July 2006, para. 34 (emphasis added).\n\n162.\n\nThere was some difference of opinion between the experts as to whether the operative date for the commencement of the one-year period was the date when permission was granted by the Egyptian Minister of Interior or when a \"formal expression\" of the foreign nationality was made. The Tribunal does not find it necessary to determine this latter point. It makes no difference to the finding of the Tribunal as to the declaration by Mr Siag since no formal declaration was made within a one year period commencing from either March 1990 when permission was granted or June 1990 when a formal expression was made through Mr Siag obtaining a Lebanese passport.\n\n*Article 10(3) - The One-Year Period*\n-------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nUnder Article 10(3), an applicant seeking permission to obtain a foreign nationality may at the same time seek permission to retain his or her Egyptian nationality. If permission to retain Egyptian nationality is granted, Article 10(3) states the applicant may retain his or her Egyptian nationality \"provided he notifies his wish to take advantage of such benefit within a period not exceeding one year from the date of acquiring the foreign nationality.\"\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the opinion of Professor Riad that the purpose for the one-year period was to give the applicant enough time after acquiring the Minister\u2019s permission and the foreign nationality to consider the appropriateness of retaining the Egyptian nationality before the ultimate decision is taken.61\n\n*Id.* para. 26.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with the view of Professor Riad that:\n\nThe existence of this two-step requirement has never been challenged in Egyptian legal doctrine. Egyptian scholars are unanimous in considering that the Minister\u2019s authorization alone merely constitutes a permission to acquire the foreign nationality and a license for the applicant to formally declare his wish to retain the Egyptian nationality. Indeed, the two-step requirement contained in article 10 has been deemed by certain authors as rather excessive.62\n\n*Id.* para. 19.\n\n166.\n\nIn its Memorial on Jurisdiction the Respondent argued that a literal interpretation of Article 10(3) requiring a formal declaration within the one year period was not favoured by \"current mainstream jurisprudence.\"63 However, the Tribunal notes that, in the face of the authorities submitted by the Claimants, in particular those from Egypt\u2019s Supreme Administrative Court,64 and evidence that in a recent book authored by the Respondent\u2019s experts Drs Abdel Aal and El Haddad they had stated that there was such a requirement,65 the Respondent backtracked somewhat on its initial claim.66 For example, at the hearing, counsel for the Respondent asserted that the unanimity of opinion expressed by Claimants created a false impression and in fact Professor Riad had not mentioned those scholars who held a contrary opinion.67\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 34-35.\n\nDecisions of 10 December 2000 and 21 December 2002.\n\n*See also* Supplemental Expert Opinion of Professor El Haddad, para. 30 (\"Despite the eloquence and strength of conviction of this opinion, it still does not comply with the current provision of the Egyptian Nationality Act, which requires a person to reiterate his wish to retain the Egyptian nationality after his willful naturalization\").\n\nIn addition, Professor El Haddad\u2019s Supplemental Opinion stated at para. 30, when discussing the critical view of Professor Salama, that \"[d]espite the eloquence and strength of conviction of this opinion, it still does not comply with the current provision of the Egyptian Nationality Act, which requires a person to reiterate his wish to retain the Egyptian nationality after his willful naturalization.\"\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 15.\n\n167.\n\nThe Respondent also continued to maintain at the hearing that there was a lack of consensus in Egyptian judicial authority as to the application of Article 10(3).68 Leave was granted to it to submit after the hearing four additional cases which its Counsel had referred to at the jurisdictional hearing as demonstrating an alternative view.\n\n*Id.* p. 20.\n\n168.\n\nThe three additional cases supplied with the Respondent\u2019s post-hearing submission do not support its position.\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent placed Its reliance on the *Lakah* case. The decision of the Higher Administrative Court was given on 27 August 2001.69 The Tribunal agrees with the contention of the Claimants in their post-hearing submission that this case did not involve any detailed analysis of Article 10(3). From the discussion of Mr Lakah\u2019s dual French/Egyptian nationality it is not possible to infer anything about the Court\u2019s view of the application of Article 10(3) and the need for a declaration within a one year period of acquisition of the foreign nationality or, in the case of an already acquired foreign nationality, the date permission is granted by the Egyptian Ministry of Interior or a \"formal expression\" made. The remaining two cases, as acknowledged by Respondent,70 do not touch on the application of Article 10(3) at all. They merely provide some background to the motivation and concerns of the drafters of the Nationality Law. The Tribunal does not find these decisions in any way demonstrate a contrary judicial opinion on the application of the two-step requirement under Article 10(3).\n\n*See* the *Lakah* case, *supra* note 33.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 28.\n\n170.\n\nIn her supplemental opinion Professor El Haddad, an expert retained by the Respondent, suggested that a declaration of intent to retain Egyptian nationality could be implied or assumed. At paragraph 35 of her supplemental opinion Professor El Haddad appeared to attempt to rewrite the terms of Article 10(3) and place a positive obligation on a person to renounce that person\u2019s Egyptian nationality. The Tribunal finds that such a reading of Article 10(3) is unsupported by the language of Article 10(3).\n\n171.\n\nProfessor Riad in his reply expert opinion confirmed that in his view an official declaration would be required. The Tribunal agrees such a requirement is strongly supported by the language of Article 20. Respondent made reference to the fact that there is no official form for the declaration in satisfaction of the two-step requirement. Like the official documents evidencing nationality the Tribunal finds that the practice of the Egyptian Interior Ministry is *prima facie* evidence only. The plain language of Article 20 makes it clear that what is required, at the very least, is an official declaration to the Egyptian Minister of Interior of the applicant\u2019s wish to retain Egyptian nationality. In the view of the Tribunal this provision leaves no room for such a declaration to be implied or assumed. The reason that Article 20 sets out formal requirements for a declaration is to provide for clarity and the avoidance of doubt. It is not disputed that Mr Siag made no such declaration.\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it is settled under Egyptian law that under Article 10(3) an applicant must make a formal declaration within one year of permission being granted in order to retain his or her Egyptian nationality. Whether the relevant date was 5 March 1990 or 14 June 1990, Mr Siag made no such declaration within the one year period and so lost his Egyptian nationality by operation of Egyptian law in 1991. The only way for him to regain that nationality was through Egyptian law. This has not taken place.\n\n173.\n\nFor all of the reasons set out above the Tribunal finds that, at all relevant times for the purposes of the ICSID Convention, Mr Siag was an Italian national and did not have Egyptian nationality.\n\nMs Clorinda Vecchi - Background\n-------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nMs Clorinda Vecchi is the mother of Mr Siag. Ms Vecchi was born in 1937 of parents who were Italian citizens and Mr Vecchi acquired Italian citizenship at birth. In 1954 Ms Vecchi married Mr Elie George Siag, the father of Mr Siag. On 19 April 1955 Ms Vecchi informed the Egyptian Interior Ministry that she wished to acquire the Egyptian citizenship of her husband. The Egyptian Minister of the Interior did not issue any decree preventing Ms Vecchi from acquiring Egyptian nationality and Ms Vecchi acquired Egyptian nationality on 19 April 1957. It appears that she then lost her Italian nationality.\n\n175.\n\nMs Vecchi's marriage came to an end in 1987 upon the death of her husband, Mr Elie George Siag. Ms Vecchi reacquired her Italian citizenship on 14 September 1993 by making a declaration under article 17 of the Italian Nationality Law No. 91 of 1992 which accords former Italian citizens the right to reacquire Italian nationality. Ms Vecchi's Italian nationality is not in dispute. What is in dispute is her continued possession of Egyptian nationality.\n\n*Acquisition of Egyptian Nationality*\n-------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nWhen Ms Vecchi informed the Egyptian Interior Ministry on 19 April 1955 that she wished to acquire Egyptian citizenship, paragraph 1 of Article 9 of Act 160 of 1950 (\"the 1950 Law\"), concerning Egyptian nationality, provided as follows:\n\nAny foreign woman who marries an Egyptian may not acquire Egyptian nationality unless she proves such wish in her marriage contract and notifies the Minister of Interior with same or submits an application stating such wish after marriage, provided that in both cases the marriage does not end before the lapse of a two-year period from the date of such notification.\n\n177.\n\nThe 1950 Law was replaced by Law No. 391 of 1956 (\"the 1956 Law\"). Article 9 of the 1956 Law made similar provision as follows:\n\nAny foreign woman who marries an Egyptian may not gain Egyptian nationality unless she notifies the Minister of Interior of such wish and provided the marriage does not end before the lapse of a two-year period from the date of such notification.\n\nNotwithstanding, before the lapse of such two-year period, the Minister of Interior may decline to grant the wife Egyptian nationality by virtue of a justified decree.\n\n178.\n\nAccording to the Respondent's Expert Opinion prepared by Professor El Haddad, which the Tribunal accepts, an official document issued in 1994 by the Egyptian Ministry of Interior's nationality department stated that it was under Article 9 of the 1956 Law that Ms Vecchi acquired her Egyptian nationality on 19 April 1957.\n\n179.\n\nThe 1956 Law was replaced by a new law in 1958 (\"the 1958 Law\") and it, in turn, was replaced by the current law, the Nationality Law. Both the 1958 Law (Article 13) and the Nationality Law (Article 7) contain provisions analogous to Article 9 of the 1956 Law. Indeed Article 7 of the Nationality Law is identical to Article 9 of the 1956 Law.\n\n*Loss of Egyptian Nationality*\n------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimants contended that Ms Vecchi lost her Egyptian nationality when she reacquired her Italian nationality on 14 September 1993. They submitted that Egyptian nationality was lost pursuant to Article 8 of the Nationality Law which for ease of reference is repeated here:\n\nIf a foreign woman acquires the Egyptian nationality under the provisions of the two previous articles, she will not forfeit it with the termination of marriage, unless she has restored her foreign nationality, or gets married to a foreigner and acquires his nationality by virtue of the law governing that nationality.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, submitted that Article 8 was inapplicable for two reasons:\n\n(i) It only applied to foreign woman and Ms Vecchi is not a \"foreign woman,\" and\n\n(ii) Article 8 only applies to a foreign woman who acquired Egyptian nationality under Articles 6 or 7 of the Nationality Law and Ms Vecchi acquired her Egyptian nationality under the 1956 Law.\n\n182.\n\nIn addition the Respondent asserted that the nationality file of Ms Vecchi held with the national authority indicated her full awareness of her Egyptian nationality status, from the time of acquisition until very recently, even after the alleged date of losing her Egyptian nationality in 1993 and that she relied upon her Egyptian nationality, for example, by using her Egyptian passport for overseas travel.\n\n*Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the Nationality Law*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nArticle 8 prescribes circumstances where a foreign woman who acquires Egyptian nationality will subsequently lose it. It is confined to circumstances where a foreign woman acquires Egyptian nationality \"under the provisions of the two previous articles.\" The Respondent contended that Article 8 was not applicable to Ms Vecchi because she acquired her Egyptian nationality under Article 9 of the 1956 Law and not pursuant to Article 7 of the Nationality Law.\n\n184.\n\nArticle 7 of the Nationality Law is substantiality similar to Article 9 of the 1956 Law (and indeed Article 13 of the 1958 law). Both Article 9 of the 1956 Law and Article 7 of the Nationality Law provide that a foreign woman who marries an Egyptian may gain Egyptian nationality if she notifies the Egyptian Minister of the Interior and provided the marriage does not end before the lapse of a two year period. In addition the Egyptian Minister of Interior may decline to grant the wife Egyptian nationality. Thus the provision under which Ms Vecchi acquired Egyptian nationality, Article 9 of the 1956 Law, is virtually the same as Article 7 of the Nationality Law. Despite this, the Respondent contended that Article 8 of the 1975 Law refers to the acquisition of nationality under Article 7 of the Nationality Law and does not pick up a corresponding provision of an earlier nationality law.\n\n185.\n\nThe Claimant, for its part, contended that the reference in Article 8, to the acquisition of Egyptian nationality under the provisions of the previous two articles, is not a temporal reference to the acquisition of nationality under Articles 6 or 7 of the Nationality Law but rather a reference to \"the substantive provisions of those articles.\" This was explained by the Claimants\u2019 expert, Professor Riad, in his expert opinion as follows:\n\nThis is incorrect. The phrase \"under the provisions of the two previous articles\" refers to the factual situations described in Articles 6 and 7 (which use the same wording as similar provisions in Egypt's previous nationality laws). If this were not the case, Ms. Vecchi and many other women who acquired the Egyptian nationality of their husbands prior to 1975 would never be able to lose their Egyptian nationality, even if their marriage terminated and they reacquired their former nationality. Egypt's Nationality Laws are a matter of public order of the highest rank, since they determine one of the basic elements of the state. Hence, the rules apply immediately as regulations applicable to all citizens. A nationality law's specification of a manner of acquiring or losing the Egyptian nationality is applicable to all Egyptians without discrimination.71\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Dr Riad of 10 July 2006, para. 49\n\n186.\n\nProfessor Riad stated, in his reply opinion that:\n\nNo other interpretation of Article 8 is permissible under Egyptian law. Once a new nationality law is enacted, it is immediately applicable to all Egyptians without discrimination. Under Egyptian law, it is not possible to interpret Article 8 as only applying to those women who acquired the Egyptian nationality of their husbands after 1975, excluding those who acquired the Egyptian nationality of their husbands before that time. Such a random discrimination could not legally flow from the phrase \"under the provisions of the two previous articles.72\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Dr Riad of 1 August 2006, para. 20.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Professor Riad's interpretation of Article 8 persuasive and compelling. As the Nationality Law supersedes the previous laws, it would be illogical to confine the operation of Article 8 to Egyptian women who acquired nationality under Article 7 of the Nationality Law but not under a corresponding provision of an earlier law.\n\n*Article 8 and \"Foreign Women\"*\n-------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nArticle 8 of the Nationality Law provides for the loss of Egyptian nationality of a \"foreign woman\" who has previously acquired Egyptian nationality. The Respondent contended that Ms Vecchi was not a \"foreign woman\" within the meaning of Article 8 and that in consequence it could have no application to her. The Respondent's argument is predicated on Article 1 of the Nationality Law which provides, in part, that Egyptian nationals include:\n\nThose who were Egyptian nationals as of 22 February 1958 under the provisions of [the 1956 law] concerned with Egyptian nationality.\n\n189.\n\nAs Ms Vecchi acquired her Egyptian nationality under the 1956 Law and was an Egyptian national on 22 February 1958, the Respondent contended that Ms Vecchi was an Egyptian and was therefore not a \"foreign woman\" within the meaning of Article 8 of the Nationality Law.\n\n190.\n\nThe Claimants contended that Ms Vecchi was a \"foreign woman\" within the meaning of Article 8. Professor Riad pointed out that the Nationality Law was the first nationality law to be enacted after the separation of Egypt and Syria from the union known as the United Arab Republic and the purpose of Article 1 was to endeavour to draw a global distinction between those who were Egyptian before the union and those who were not. He stated in his expert opinion:\n\nIt is also suggested that Article 8 of Law No. 26 of 1975 is not applicable to Ms Vecchi because she was not a \"foreign woman\" as mentioned in Articles 7 or 8. It is suggested that Ms Vecchi was an \"original\" Egyptian national under Article 1 of Law No. 26 of 1975. That article refers to those who were Egyptian nationals as of the date of Egypt's nationality law of 1958 under the provisions of Egypt's nationality law of 1956.\n\nMarriage to an Egyptian national was the sole cause of Ms Vecchi's acquisition of Egyptian nationality. That fact is not altered in any way by the provisions of Article 1 of Law No 26 of 1975. As this law was the first nationality law to be enacted after the separation of Egypt and Syria from their brief union as the United Arab Republic, Article 1 endeavored to draw a global distinction between those who were Egyptian before that union and those who were not. In other words, this article has nothing to do with the grounds on which the nationality of each Egyptian is established. Hence, it has no relevance to the way Ms Vecchi acquired her Egyptian nationality and does not mean that she falls outside of Article 8 of Law No 26, dealing with foreign women who acquired the Egyptian nationality by marriage to an Egyptian.73\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Dr Riad of 10 July 2006, paras. 50-51.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts this analysis of Article 8 which is strongly supported by the statutory language. If Ms Vecchi was not a \"foreign woman\" she could not have acquired Egyptian nationality under the principles espoused in Article 6 and 7 of the Nationality Law. In truth the contention of Egypt is in essence a restatement of its earlier argument that the reference to \"the two previous articles\" in Article 8 confines the operation of Article 8 to a person who acquired Egyptian nationality under the Nationality Law. This is a contention which the Tribunal has not upheld for the reasons given in paragraphs 183-187 above.\n\n192.\n\nIn its Memorial on Jurisdiction the Respondent contended that Ms Vecchi was aware of her Egyptian nationality status and sought to use it even after the alleged \"loss\" of her nationality in 1993. The Respondent referred to a number of documents to this effect:\n\nThe nationality file of Clorinda held with the Nationality Authority indicates her full awareness of her Egyptian nationality status, from the time of acquisition thereof until very recently even after the alleged date of losing her Egyptian nationality in 1993 and registering the Request for Arbitration.\n\nTo strengthen same, such awareness is fully illustrated in a vast array of documents that include the following:\n\n\u2022 Nationality certificates issued to verify the Egyptian nationality of Clorinda (issued in *July 26, 1966* and *March 1, 1993).*\n\n\u2022 Clorinda's application to the Egyptian authorities to review her passport, an instrument that is granted solely to the nationals of Egypt and her declaration that all information contained in the application form was accurate (submitted on *May 11, 1999).* The declaration contained in this application reads in its relevant part as follows:\n\nI hereby declare that all data stated hereinabove as well as the documents submitted by myself are valid and in conformity with my current status and further declare that any passport previously issued for me has expired and may not be renewed. Additionally, I hereby undertake to advise the *[Nationality]* Authority with any loss of the passport of modification thereto in the future.\n\n\u2022 Clorinda used extensively her Egyptian passport to travel to and from Egypt even after the date of submitting the Request for Arbitration and the registration thereof (that took place on August 5, 2005).\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, these above referenced acts of Clorinda leave no option but to rely on the notion reflected in the ICSID decision of *Champion Trading et al v Egypt* that ruled the following:\n\nThe mere fact that this investment in Egypt by the three individual Claimants was done by using, for whatever reason and purpose, exclusively their Egyptian nationality clearly qualifies them as dual nationals within the meaning of the Convention and thereby based on Article 25 (2)(a) excludes them from invoking the Convention.74\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 55-57.\n\n193.\n\nFor all of the reasons given above the Tribunal finds that such references to documents reflecting nationality are *prima facie* evidence only and the Ms Vecchi\u2019s nationality falls to be determined by the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation and application of Egyptian law.\n\n194.\n\nProfessor Riad\u2019s opinion was that, on the date Ms Vecchi reacquired Italian nationality on 14 September 1993 \"[u]nder Article 8, she automatically and *ipso jure* lost Egyptian nationality\"75 under the Nationality Law. Once again the Tribunal accepts this opinion. Such operation of Article 8 of the Nationality Law was not disputed by the Respondent, perhaps because it advanced an alternative argument that Article 8 was not applicable. The Tribunal finds that Ms Vecchi was at the relevant times an Italian national only and so satisfies the requirements set out in Article 25 of the Convention.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Dr Riad of 10 July 2006, para. 47.\n\nIs the Application of Egypt\u2019s Nationality Law Contrary to International Law?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal has ruled that on an application of the nationality law of Egypt both Mr Siag and Ms Vecchi satisfy the negative nationality requirement having lost their Egyptian nationality prior to the relevant dates under the ICSID Convention. As noted by Professor Schreuer, situations where a nationality that is valid under domestic law may be disregarded as a matter of international law are situations of ineffective nationality lacking a genuine link between the State and the individual, involuntary acquisition of nationality or withdrawal of nationality contrary to international law.\n\n196.\n\nThe Respondent has asserted that all of the Claimants\u2019 connections are with Egypt. This is another way of saying that the Claimants links with Italy are ineffective to establish jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention as a matter of international law. The links of the Claimants with Egypt are not disputed. However, as noted above the Tribunal\u2019s findings are that through the operation of the Nationality Law both Claimants have lost their Egyptian nationality and only held Italian nationality at the relevant times for the purposes of the Convention. Thus, this is not a situation where the Claimants are dualnationals.76 In such a case of dual-nationality, the clear provisions of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention state that the Claimants would not have satisfied the so-called negative nationality requirement. The Tribunal agrees with the view of Professor Reisman who stated:\n\nSiag and Vecchi\u2019s historic and continuing residence and operation of business interests in Egypt is likewise irrelevant, under the municipal laws of Italy and Egypt, respectively, to their legal status as Italian nationals and their loss of legal stats as Egyptian nationals. Under Egyptian law, as Dr Riad explains, Siag lost his Egyptian nationality in 1990; under Italian law, he acquired Italian nationality (by virtue of his marriage to an Italian citizen) in 1993. Vecchi, similarly, lost her Egyptian nationality in 1993, when she chose to reacquire the Italian nationality that she possessed at birth. Neither Siag nor Vecchi qualifies as a dual national, rendering the search for \u2018genuine links\u2019 inapposite. Again, no evidence suggests that either Siag or Vecchi modified their nationality for fraudulent purposes or as a mere expedient, that is, to gain international legal protection under the BIT that they would otherwise lack. To the contrary, the events that legally terminated their Egyptian nationality and conferred (or, in the case of Vecchi, re-conferred) their Italian nationality preceded, by more than a decade, the institution of this arbitration [...].77\n\n*See* Expert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 12 July 2006, para. 25 (referring to *Feldman v Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Interim Decision on Preliminary Jurisdictional Issues, 6 December 2000 (\"dual nationality problems, including the search of the \u2018dominant or effective nationality\u2019, require,\" in the first place, \"the existence of a double citizenship\" *as a matter of law* (emphasis in the original)).\n\n*Id.* para. 26.\n\n197.\n\nThe view of the ICSID Tribunal in the *Champion Trading* case was that the provisions of Article 25 were clear and left no room for a discussion of \"dominant\" or \"effective\" nationality. It said:\n\nAccording to the Claimants this Tribunal should, when applying the nationality requirement under Convention, use the definition as it has been developed in international law as shown in the above quoted Nottebohm and A/18 decisions.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Egyptian nationality of the three individual Claimants does not correspond to the prevailing definition of nationality in international law. If they are to be considered Egyptian it is only because of Egyptian law which conferred Egyptian nationality on them at birth. The Claimants submit that, in fact, they neither have today nor ever have had any particular ties or relations with Egypt. Claimants conclude that such an involuntary nationality should not be taken into account when interpreting the Convention.\n\nThe Nottebohm and A/18 decisions, in the opinion of the Tribunal, find no application in the present case. The Convention in Article 25(2)(a) contains a clear and specific rule regarding dual nationals. The Tribunal notes that the above cited A/18 decision contained an important reservation that the real and effective nationality was indeed relevant *\"unless an exception is clearly stated.\"* The Tribunal is faced here with such a clear exception.78\n\n*Champion Trading, supra* note 4, p. 288 (emphasis in the original).\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with the finding of the ICSID Tribunal in the *Champion Trading* case that the regime established under Article 25 of the ICSID Tribunal does not leave room for a test of dominant or effective nationality. The BIT contains a clear definition of who is to be considered a national. Article 1(3) defines a \"natural person\" as \"with respect to either Contracting State, a natural person holding the nationality of that State in accordance with its laws \" (underlining added). This is the kind of exception referred to in the decision of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in the A/18 case.79 While it may be asserted that if this were a diplomatic protection case it could be argued differently, the parties have consented to have their dispute resolved under the ICSID Convention and it sets out a particular regime for the determination of jurisdiction. Under Article 9(3) of the BIT the avenue of diplomatic protection is specifically excluded while the arbitration is in progress. Developments in international law concerning nationality of individuals in the field of diplomatic protection including, for example, greater flexibility in the requirement for the link of nationality, while of interest, must give way to the specific regime under the ICSID Convention and the terms of the BIT.\n\nCase No. A/18, 6 April 1984, Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (5 Iran-U.S.C.T.R. 251).\n\n199.\n\nThis is not a situation where a claimant is seeking to assert a particular nationality in order to bring a claim and that nationality is claimed to be ineffective. Nor is it a case where the consequence of a determination of the nationality of an individual by one state as against other states falls to be determined. This case concerns a state, through operation of its domestic law, ceasing to regard individuals as its nationals.80 In this case the Claimants contend that they lost their Egyptian nationality through operation of Egyptian domestic law so that they were not dual-nationals at all. In the *Champion Trading* case the claimants asserted that the test of effective nationality should be applied as an alternative argument based on a finding that under the operation of Egypt\u2019s nationality law they had acquired Egyptian nationality involuntarily and so were dual-nationals. It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that in this case it does not even have to consider that possibility since it has found as a matter of Egyptian law that the Claimants did not possess Egyptian nationality at the relevant times under the ICSID Convention.\n\n*See* the extract from Oppenheim\u2019s International Law quoted at paragraph 144 above.\n\n200.\n\nIn any event, as to the Claimants links to Italy, it is uncontested that the Claimants have Italian nationality. The Respondent focused on the Claimants\u2019 connections to Egypt and has not questioned the acquisition of Italian nationality by the Claimants except to note, in response to the opinion of Professor Reisman that an examination of effectiveness of nationality was inapplicable in this case, that their connections to that country are slight. The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not demonstrated that the Claimants acquired Italian nationality as a mere expedient in order to bring these claims before ICSID. Both Claimants acquired Italian nationality in 1993, a long time before these claims were brought. Italian nationality was also acquired for recognized reasons i.e. marriage to an Italian in the case of Mr Siag and reacquisition following the death of a husband in the case of Ms Vecchi. The Tribunal finds that the Claimants possess genuine links to Italy.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this case does not present a situation where there is scope for international law principles to override the operation of Egyptian domestic law as to nationality. To do so would in effect involve the illegitimate revision of the terms of the BIT and the Nationality Law by the Tribunal.\n\n**B. Alleged Lack of Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Materiae***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nIn its Memorial on Jurisdiction the Respondent questioned the presence of expenditure by the Claimants in their personal capacities and what was described as the \"foreign origin\" of the expenditure.81 As to the second element the Respondent submitted, making reference to what it called \"the intent of the Convention,\" that a foreign origin of investment was required. With reference to the preamble of the BIT, it was submitted that the origin of the investment required \"Italian\" capital. Article 6 of the BIT was also relied on since its subject heading referred to \"Repatriation of Capital and Returns.\" It was Respondent\u2019s contention that this envisaged a prior act of importation from Italy.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 70-71.\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent asserted that the investment in this case was devoid of any foreign element from its inception. It was noted that at the Claimants were indisputably Egyptian nationals at the time the BIT was entered into on 2 March 1989, and on the date of entering into the Municipal Sales Contract with the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism on 4 January 1989. In addition, the corporate vehicles used for the purposes of the investment Siag Touristic and Siag Taba were local entities established under applicable Egyptian laws.\n\n204.\n\nClaimants replied that the only dates of relevance under the Convention so far as the nationality requirement was concerned were the date of consent and the date of registration. In any event, the Claimants emphasized the fact that the bulk of the investment took place in the 1990s after, on Claimants\u2019 case, the Claimants lost their Egyptian nationality and acquired Italian nationality. The definition of \"investment\" was broad. Consistent with the practice and decisions of ICSID Tribunals such a definition should be given \"broad reach.\"82 Claimants submitted that as set out in their Memorial on the Merits their shares in Siag Touristic and Siag Taba as well as claims to money from these companies relating to the property and the project fell within the definition of \"investment.\" It was contended that it was immaterial that these investments were made through the medium of companies, which were controlled by the Claimants.\n\n*See* *Fedax, supra* note 20, para. 24. The term \"investment\" in Article 25 of the Convention must be given a \"broad reach.\" The Tribunal observed that \"distinguished commentators of the Convention have concluded that a \u2018broad approach to the interpretation of this term is warranted.\u2019\" *Id.* para. 22.\n\n205.\n\nAs to the timing issue, Professor Schreuer has stated in his authoritative treatise:\n\nIn the traditional law of diplomatic protection, a requirement of continuous nationality is often asserted from the time the claim arises up to the date it is taken up by the State of the injured person\u2019s nationality or even up to the date of a decision. The Convention does not require continuity of nationality. Its wording is directed at distinct points in time and not at a continuous period of time, which could have been expressed quite easily by \"from to\" or \"continuously until\" rather than by \"as well as\" and \"on either date.\"83\n\nSchreuer, *supra* note 25, p. 274.\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the conclusions of Professor Schreuer and finds that the relevant dates under the Convention are the date of consent and the date of registration.\n\n207.\n\nThe Convention requires an \"investment\" but does not limit the term in any manner. The BIT, like many BITs contains a broad definition of \"investment.\" The Claimants have submitted that the majority of expenditure in the Taba project was made by them personally. For the purposes of determining jurisdiction the Tribunal finds this fact to be established. In any event, the definition of \"investment\" at Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT includes acquisitions of shares in companies and under (c) \"claims to money.\" The Tribunal finds that the fact Claimants managed their investment through the medium of companies incorporated under Egyptian law does not exclude the Claimants from falling within the definition of \"investment\" of the BIT.\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimants noted that the recent majority decision of an ICSID Tribunal had specifically rejected an \"origin of capital\" requirement.84 The *Tokios Tokeles* Tribunal found as follows after examining the terms of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT:\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT defines \"investment\" as \"every kind of asset invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter [...].85 [...]\n\nThe Treaty contains no requirement that the capital used by the investor to make the investment originate in Lithuania, or, indeed, that such capital not have originated in Ukraine.86\n\n[...]\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to infer, without textual foundation, that the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT requires the Claimant to demonstrate further that the capital used to make an investment in Ukraine originated from non-Ukrainian sources. In our view, however, neither the text of the definition of \"investment,\" nor the context in which the term is defined, nor the object and purpose of the Treaty allow such an origin-of-capital requirement to be implied. The requirement is plainly absent from the text. In addition, the context in which the term \"investment\" is defined, namely, *\"every* kind of asset invested by an investor,\" does not support the restriction advocated by the Respondent. Finally, the origin-of-capital requirement is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Treaty, which, as discussed above, is to provide broad protection to investors and their investments in the territory of either party. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds no basis on which to impose the restriction proposed by the Respondent on the scope of covered investments.87\n\n*Tokios Tokeles, supra* note 21, para. 82.\n\n*Id.* para. 17.\n\n*Id.* para. 74.\n\n*Id.* para. 77.\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal in *Tokios Tokeles* also stated:\n\nEven assuming *arguendo,* that all of the capital used by the Claimant to invest in Ukraine had its ultimate origin in Ukraine, the resulting investment would not be outside the scope of the Convention. The Claimant made an investment for the purposes of the Convention when it decided to deploy capital under its control in the territory of Ukraine instead of investing it elsewhere. The origin of the capital is not relevant to the existence of an investment.88\n\n[...]\n\n[T]he Claimant in the present case owns and controls the assets in Ukraine that have given rise to this dispute. The origin of the capital used to acquire these assets is not relevant to the question of jurisdiction under the Convention.\n\nIn our view, the ICSID Convention contains no inchoate requirement that the investment at issue in a dispute have an international character in which the origin of the capital is decisive.89\n\n*Id.* para. 80.\n\n*Id.* paras. 81-82.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the situation is no different in this case and agrees with the conclusions reached by the *Tokios Tokeles* Tribunal. The terms of the BIT do not impose any \"origin of capital\" requirement. The Respondent\u2019s objection on this basis is not upheld.\n\n211.\n\nFor all of the above reasons the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have made an investment for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**C. Estoppel**\n---------------\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the provisions of Article 25 of the Convention contain a complete procedure for the determination of jurisdictional issues.90 There is no room to introduce additional estoppel arguments. Such matters should be addressed at the merits stage. For these reasons the Tribunal finds that the estoppel arguments raised by the Respondent as objections to jurisdiction are not upheld. Since these issues are more properly matters for the merits of the dispute the Tribunal does not find it necessary to comment on them further at this stage.\n\n*See* Transcript, Day 1, p. 74. Counsel for Egypt conceded as much at the hearing when he acknowledged that *estoppel* is \"not a hundred per cent jurisdiction.\" *Id.*\n\n**D. Abuse of Rights**\n----------------------\n\n213.\n\nIn its submissions the Claimants raised the international law doctrine of abuse of rights. Given its findings in relation to the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction above the Tribunal does not find it necessary to rule on the issues raised with respect to the abuse of rights doctrine.\n\n**E. Costs**\n------------\n\n214.\n\nEach party has requested the Tribunal to award it costs for the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. For the time being, the Tribunal has decided to defer a decision on costs to the second phase of the case when it will be in a position to make an overall judgment about the costs of the arbitration.\n\n**V. THE DECISION**\n-------------------\n\n215.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons and rejecting all submissions to the contrary the Tribunal makes the following decisions:\n\n(i) That the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n(ii) That the dispute should proceed to the merits.\n\n(iii) That the costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the ICSID Secretariat, are reserved for further consideration and subsequent determination."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2009-06-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a (Award)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2009-05-11T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a (Award)\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1].\n\nLike with the dissent of this arbitrator in respect of the Decision on Jurisdiction, I very much regret not to be able to share some views and conclusions that my learned colleagues have reached in the Award on the merits which is now issued by the Tribunal. Once again I do so with great respect and admiration for the work that has been undertaken in the preparation of this Award. While I agree with many of the conclusions reached, I have felt that it is my duty to point out such differences where questions of special significance are involved. In a case so abundant on evidence and arguments, it is only natural that the record might be interpreted or assessed differently, which is a legitimate exercise for arbitrators and counsel alike. In this context I must express my appreciation to the distinguished counsel that have represented both parties in this arbitration, with some of whom I have had the pleasure of working on prior occasions.\n\n[2].\n\nThe first such difference concerns yet again the question of one of the Claimants\u2019 nationality. This time, however, the issue has arisen not only in connection with the interpretation of the applicable legislation and principles, particularly insofar Egypt\u2019s legislation on nationality and the operation of the *Nottebohm* principle of effective nationality are concerned, which were the thrust of the dissent on jurisdiction, but also in connection with a far more delicate matter. This is the question whether the certificate of registration concerning the relevant Lebanese nationality claimed by that Claimant was obtained by improper means and does not accordingly reflect the actual situation as no such registration was found in the official records of Lebanon.\n\n[3].\n\nThis arbitrator of course willingly accepts that the interpretation of the facts brought before the Tribunal is open to different readings, but I have been persuaded and ultimately convinced that the evidence provided by the Respondent is enough to establish such impropriety. Whether this could be considered a case of fraud, corruption, traffic of influence or some other form of impropriety, the fact is that money appears to have changed hands with a view to obtain an untrue certification.\n\n[4].\n\nThis conclusion in no way reflects adversely on any of the distinguished counsel that have represented the Claimants in these proceedings, nor on my colleagues in the Tribunal, as none would be willing to condone such practices. The difference of opinions is not concerned with the principle but only with a different assessment of the evidence and whether it is sufficient to establish such impropriety. In the view of counsel for the Claimants and the Award the evidence has not so established, while in my opinion it has. An examination of the main facts is therefore important to explain the reasons of this dissent.\n\n[5].\n\nIt has been explained by counsel for the Respondent that in the course of preparing the argument on *estoppel* that the Tribunal ordered in the Decision on Jurisdiction to be examined in conjunction with the merits, doubts arose as to certain characteristics of the certificates attesting to the registration of the Claimant concerned as a national of Lebanon. The case for *estoppel,* as argued by Egypt, was that the Claimant had relied on its Egyptian nationality to conduct its business and obtain certain benefits available to nationals of that country and accordingly could not rely now on the purported loss of Egyptian nationality because of having obtained that of Lebanon. It was accordingly necessary and appropriate to examine again the relevant evidence on Lebanese nationality.\n\n[6].\n\nIn the light of such doubts, the question was brought to the attention of the Lebanese authorities concerned with public records, most notably the Ministry of the Interior, with a view to finding out the precise record of the Claimant\u2019s registration. After various inquiries it was concluded that such registration did not exist. The certificate attesting to that registration, it was argued, was thus false, forged or tainted by some other irregularity that did not reflect the actual truth. It was also argued that the documents based on that certification issued by the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo, including two passports in the name of the Claimant, were thus equally untrue.\n\n[7].\n\nWhile the issue of whether forgery, fraud, deception or some other misconduct characterized the documents in question gave place to lengthy discussions, the matter became crystal clear at the closing of the hearing on the merits. Following a question from the Chairman about whether the claim of forgery was to be disregarded, it was so confirmed by counsel for Egypt, with the clarification that two aspects were involved in this discussion: \"...a document that was not genuine, on the basis of which everybody was misled to believe that the passports are genuine. They are not forged. The Lebanese Embassy in Egypt was misled by a document that is not genuine\" [Transcript, 18 March 2008, at 46-47].\n\n[8].\n\nIn my examination of the evidence, the latter statement is the one that convincingly explains what actually had been the real situation. Four different documents were subject to close scrutiny. The first was the certificate of registration. This was the document giving rise to doubts about its genuineness and the ultimate certification by the Lebanese authorities about the fact that no record of registration for the Claimant existed. Whether the certificate bore official seals and marks, or even signatures, that were illegible, does not alter the fact that it attested to a non-existent registration. Impropriety in obtaining the certificate was therefore the necessary implication of such situation.\n\n[9].\n\nOn the basis of that certificate, the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo issued first a certificate on Claimant\u2019s Lebanese nationality and its registration in the records of the mission. Such document does not mean that the individual record on which it was based was genuine, as the Lebanese consular office is not the authority in charge of public records of that country. The Embassy later issued the two passports noted, which were also based on the false information provided. It follows that neither these passports constitute proof that the Claimant was indeed a Lebanese national. Few countries will require that embassies check for the genuineness of documents submitted unless something awkward is apparent from them.\n\n[10].\n\nIt has been admitted in the proceedings that the Claimant concerned paid US $5,000 to a Lebanese lawyer in connection with obtaining the certificate of registration, as it has been also admitted that this was done in order to avoid military service in Egypt. That particular gentleman seems to have vanished from earth as his first name, address or other relevant information about him have been conveniently forgotten by the Claimant concerned [Transcript, March 10, 2008, at 153 et seq.] While it could be thought that the amount involved is not beyond the ordinary for professional services of the kind, it must not be forgotten that these events were contemporaneous with the most dramatic moments of civil war in Lebanon, a context in which such amount becomes significant and can go a very long way.\n\n[11].\n\nBecause such events were surrounded by none too clear circumstances, the Tribunal rightly directed the Claimant concerned to submit documentary evidence in terms of a \"certification from the Lebanese Ministry of the Interior that Mr. Siag is a Lebanese national, and the date and place of his registration\" or if not to explain why it was unable to obtain the requested documents (Procedural Order No. 6, para. 6.3). No such document was produced as none existed. While many explanations were offered about the state of public records in Lebanon, none is in my view convincing. Lebanon has a long tradition of public service which in spite of many difficulties has continued to function, just as its diplomatic service has.\n\n[12].\n\nThe burden of proof is, in my understanding, still on the Claimant who has to prove that it holds the nationality it claims to have and this it has failed to do in spite of having been directed by the Tribunal to supply the appropriate certification. The Award has taken a different view on this matter in the belief that it is for Egypt to prove fraud, deception or other dishonest behaviour, a proof that would not have been met. While I do not disagree with the need to so prove, I respectfully disagree in respect of the conclusion that this did not happen. I believe that Egypt has so proven by providing ample official documentation on the matter.\n\n[13].\n\nIn this context I also disagree about the applicable standard of proof. While the Award has chosen the United States standard of clear and convincing evidence, it is my view that arbitration tribunals, particularly those deciding under international law, are free to choose the most relevant rules in accordance with the circumstances of the case and the nature of the facts involved, as it has been increasingly recognized (Abdulhay Sayed, Corruption in International Trade and Commercial Arbitration (2004), at pp. 89-92). The facts of this case, difficult as they are to establish with absolute certainty, could be best judged under a standard of proof allowing the Tribunal \"discretion in inferring from a collection of concordant circumstantial evidence *(faisceau d\u2019indices)* the facts at which the various indices are directed\" [Ibid., at 93-94].\n\n[14].\n\nIn the end, it must be decided whether the information provided by the Lebanese authorities, a country which is not a party to these proceedings, or that supplied by the Claimant, who is the party most involved in the arbitration and with specific interests in its outcome, is to be relied upon. This arbitrator has not the slightest doubt that the former is to prevail. The only other choice would have been to request the intervention of Interpol in support of the Tribunal\u2019s task to establish the true facts, which was not asked for nor in my view appeared necessary in view of the evidence on record.\n\n[15].\n\nThe legal implications of the facts noted above are serious indeed. It is not just a question concerning jurisdiction. In spite of jurisdiction having been affirmed by the Tribunal, a party is not prevented from submitting additional jurisdictional objections if they are based on events not known at the time of the pleadings on jurisdiction, which in this case neither could they have been known as the doubts about genuineness arose later. This is why I respectfully dissent from the Award\u2019s finding about the claim on this count having been untimely and waived.\n\n[16].\n\nIrrespective of jurisdiction, however, the most serious consequences relate to the merits of the case. I am convinced that money changed hands improperly so as to obtain a certificate of a non-existent registration, a situation which was not uncommon at the time as a consequence of the civil war. While the goal pursued by the original certification was to avoid Egyptian military service, a goal which is bad enough, and this was done some years before the actual dispute was submitted to arbitration, the fact is that the same certification has now been used in support of a multi-million dollar claim.\n\n[17].\n\nWhether the principle of ex *turpi causa non oritur actio,* the doctrine of unclean hands or the policy of eliminating corruption domestically and internationally are relied upon, the result is that an arbitration tribunal cannot find for a claim that is tainted by such practices. As the Tribunal in *World Duty Free* held in this respect:\n\n\"In light of domestic laws and international conventions relating to corruption, and in light of the decisions taken in this matter by courts and arbitral tribunals, this Tribunal is convinced that bribery is contrary to the international public policy of most, if not all, States or, to use another formula, to transnational public policy. Thus, claims based on contracts of corruption or on contracts obtained by corruption cannot be upheld by this Arbitral Tribunal\" [World Duty Free Company Limited v. Republic of Kenya, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7, Award of 4 October 2006, para. 157],\n\n[18].\n\nIf one substitutes certificates of registration of nationality for contracts arrives exactly, in my respectful view, to the same conclusion. Accordingly, I believe that the claim in the instant case should be dismissed on the merits.\n\n[19].\n\nI regrettably must also dissent on some other points of law or fact relating to different matters. One such matter concerns the repossession of the land under the Sale contract and its later expropriation. It is an established fact the project suffered a number of delays. How influential these delays were in completing the project on time is a question open to discussion. The Award accepts the argument that the project was close to completion at the time the land was repossessed and the contract terminated. In spite of technical studies and courts decisions that would so establish, I am not quite convinced that this was the case. The photographic evidence does not seem to show such timely completion. In any event, what the Respondent did in this respect was to exercise a right under the provisions of the contract.\n\n[20].\n\nIt is a fact, however, that expropriation of the land was later undertaken, a point which is not disputed. The question of the appropriate compensation, however, has been much disputed and is now decided in the Award. My dissent from the reasoning of the Award on this other matter is that I am not persuaded that the Treaty allows for a standard of compensation different from fair market value at the time of expropriation. There are of course situations where that standard might be inadequate in the light of the circumstances of the case, but in the instant case the application of Article 5 (iii) of the Treaty becomes compelling as the project had not actually began to operate, generate profits or provide any other element that would allow the Tribunal to consider that compensation should aim at a long-term view of the effects of expropriation. Such long-term view is what has led some tribunals and writers to suggest the existence of a different standard of compensation for unlawful expropriation, largely based on customary international law. This might well be justified in some cases, but this one does not appear to qualify for that still exceptional treatment under international law. On this point I accordingly also dissent from the Award.\n\n[21].\n\nThis has also implications for the amount of compensation decided. First, I am not quite in agreement about relying for such purpose on the exclusive view of experts invited by the Claimants, however distinguished they are. But more importantly, I believe that in this case the starting point should have been different from the comparative view taken by the experts and accepted by the Award in relation to other existing and ongoing projects, a number of which are unrelated to the Taba area.\n\n[22].\n\nI believe it would have been more appropriate to start from the award of discreet damages and costs, to be supplemented by such other factors as might be related to the fair market value of the property at the time of the expropriation and subject to the payment of an interest that would adequately take care of time and value. I also believe that it might have been appropriate to take into account eventual breaches of fair and equitable treatment and compensate them accordingly. In my view, the end figure of compensation should not have been above US$ 30 million. It must also be kept in mind that the capital contribution made by the Claimants to the project was minimal, that is 25% of a total capital of approximately US$ 3 million, in respect of which there are still important outstanding debts with the original partners and Egyptian banks.\n\n[23].\n\nA last point of this dissent relates to the award of costs. First, I do not believe that costs relating to stages of litigation that took place before this arbitration began should be awarded at all. In respect of the costs of this arbitration I believe that a more adequate approach would be to require each party to pay one half of such costs, particularly taking into account the fact that the Claimant agreed to pay attorney\u2019s fees only on a successful recovery. While there is nothing unusual in such arrangement, it entails the acceptance of the Claimant of a degree of risk that should not be entirely shifted to the Respondent, particularly in view of the amounts involved."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION - THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case involves an investment dispute between Claimants, Mr Waguih Elie George Siag and Mrs Clorinda Vecchi, and Respondent, the Arab Republic of Egypt (\"Egypt\"). Mr Siag and his mother Ms Vecchi are natural citizens of Italy. As Claimants they bring this case under the ICSID Convention and the Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments between the Republic of Italy and the Arab Republic of Egypt dated March 2, 1989 (hereinafter the \"Italy - Egypt BIT\" or \"BIT\"). Mrs Vecchi died on 16 October 2007. Her claim is now advanced by the executors of her estate.1\n\nThe claim by the executors is discussed at paras. 489-503.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are the principal investors in Touristic Investments and Hotels Management Company (SIAG) S.A.E, and Siag Taba Company (together \"Siag\"), companies incorporated under the laws of Egypt. In 1989, the Government of Egypt (the \"Government\" or \"GOE\"), acting through its Ministry of Tourism, sold a large parcel of oceanfront land on the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea (the \"Property\") to Touristic Investments and Hotels Management Company (SIAG) for the purpose of developing a tourist resort (the \"Project\"). SIAG subsequently transferred a portion of the Property to Siag Taba Company. The Claimants allege that through a series of acts and omissions commencing in 1995, Egypt expropriated their investment, consisting of the Property owned by Claimants and the Project, and thus destroyed the value of Claimants\u2019 investments. In support of these allegations, they point to the indisputable fact that the Courts of Egypt on several occasions passed orders declaring the taking of the property by Egypt to be invalid and granting declaratory and injunctive relief but to no avail since the Court orders were never complied with.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants contend that their treatment, and that of their investment, consisting of the Property and the Project, violates the most basic notions of proper governmental conduct and respect for the rule of law. They say the case involves \"undisguised bigotry and religious zealotry, governmental conduct based on contrivances, perjury by government attorneys in domestic court proceedings, blatant disrespect for the judicial branch of government and the finality of its rulings, extra-judicial seizures by brute force, the failure of the police to provide the most minimal levels of assistance or protection, governmental harassment and intimidation on multiple fronts, and corruption at the highest levels of the Government.\"2 Claimants further argue that Egypt has not seriously contested its liability in this case, and has not adduced a single witness of fact. It is the Claimants\u2019 argument that Egypt\u2019s failure to challenge Claimants\u2019 recitation of the facts of this case essentially establishes Egypt\u2019s liability, and leaves to the Tribunal the task of fixing compensation.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, p. 1.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants seek a declaration that Egypt violated numerous provisions of the BIT, as well as international law and Egyptian law. They also claim compensation for all damages suffered, costs, and an award of compound interest.\n\n5.\n\nEgypt advanced a number of defences, particularly but not exclusively in relation to Mr Siag. The central plank of Egypt\u2019s case is that Mr Siag was at all relevant times a national of Egypt, thus precluding him from succeeding in a claim against Egypt under the Italy - Egypt BIT. This contention was rejected in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction of 11 April 2007. Nevertheless Egypt later reformulated this contention and vigorously pursued it before the Tribunal. Egypt also contended that the expropriation had been lawful. It contended that the Claimants\u2019 claim to damages was vastly exaggerated and said if liability was established, which was strongly resisted, the damages should be nominal only.\n\n**The Italy - Egypt BIT**\n-------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe stated objective of the BIT is to create favourable conditions for greater economic cooperation between Italy and Egypt, particularly for investments by one contracting state in the territory of the other.3 The BIT recognises that the encouragement and reciprocal protection under international agreements of such investments will be conducive to the stimulation of business initiative and will increase prosperity in both contracting states.4 The BIT provides a number of guarantees and protections to investors including: (1) fair and equitable treatment of investments;5 (2) a prohibition against unreasonable or discriminatory measures;6 (3) most favoured nation treatment of investments;7 (4) most favoured nation treatment of activity in connection with investments;8 (5) full protection;9 (6) a prohibition against measures that limit the right of ownership, possession, control, or enjoyment of investments;10 and (7) a prohibition against direct or indirect nationalization or expropriation, or measures having an equivalent effect, except for a public purpose in the national interest and against payment of adequate and fair compensation calculated at market value.11\n\nItaly - Egyt BIT, para. 1.\n\nIbid., para. 2.\n\nIbid., Article 2(2).\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., Article 3(1).\n\nIbid., Article 3(2).\n\nIbid., Article 4(1).\n\nIbid., Article 5(1)(l).\n\nIbid., Article 5(1)(ii).\n\n7.\n\nArticle 9 of the BIT is devoted to dispute resolution and follows the usual pattern of BITs. Thus Article 9(1) provides for the right of Investors to have recourse to arbitration pursuant to the ICSID Convention. It reads as follows:\n\n(1) All kinds of disputes or differences, including disputes over the amount of compensation for expropriation, nationalizations or similar measures, between one Contracting State and an investor of the other Contracting State concerning an investment of that investor in the territory and maritime zones of the former Contracting State shall, if possible, be settled amicably. [Underlining added.]\n\n8.\n\nIf such disputes or differences cannot be settled within six months from the date of request for settlement, the investor concerned may submit the dispute to the competent court of the Contracting State for decision or initiate an ICSID arbitration or, if such is not applicable, proceed to arbitration under the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n**Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\")**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nItaly ratified the ICSID Convention on 29 March 1971. Egypt did so on 3 May 1972.\n\n10.\n\nArticles 25(1) and 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute. [Underlining added.]\n\n**Egyptian Nationality Law**\n----------------------------\n\n11.\n\nA central plank of Egypt\u2019s defence In respect of Mr Slag\u2019s claim remains that he was at all material times a national of Egypt. It is therefore appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of the Egyptian Nationality Law No. 26 of 1975 (\"the Nationality Law\").12\n\n**Article 1**\n\nEgyptian citizens fall under the following categories:\n\n[...]\n\n**Second**\n\nThose who were Egyptian citizens as of 22 February 1958 under the provisions of Law No. 391 of 1956 concerned with Egyptian Nationality.\n\n**Article 10**\n\n\"An Egyptian may not gain a foreign nationality except after being permitted by virtue of a decree from the Minister of Interior; otherwise such person shall still be considered an Egyptian in every respect and under all circumstances, unless the Cabinet decides to withdraw his nationality under the provision of Article 16 of this Law.\n\nIn the event an Egyptian is permitted to gain a foreign nationality, then this shall lead to the withdrawal of the Egyptian nationality.\n\nHowever, permission to acquire a foreign nationality may allow the person for whom such permission is given, his wife and minor children to retain the Egyptian nationality, provided he notifies his wish to take advantage of such benefit within a period not exceeding one year from the date of gaining the foreign nationality, and in such case they may retain the Egyptian nationality despite having gained a foreign nationality.\"13\n\n**Article 20**\n\nDeclarations, notifications, documents and applications stipulated under this Law shall be addressed to the Minister of Interior or whomever he delegates in this regard, and issued on the forms determined by virtue of a decree from the Minister of Interior.\n\n[Underlining added in Article 10.]\n\nThese English translations are from Egypt\u2019s Exhibit 5. These provisions were examined at length In the Decision of this Tribunal as to Jurisdiction of 11 April 2007. However, In view of Egypt\u2019s subsequent Invocation of further jurisdictional arguments It Is necessary to set out the provisions again.\n\nThere was a slight difference between the translations submitted by Egypt In Its Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 28, and Legal Authorities, Exhibit 5. See hearing on jurisdiction T1: 51. It was agreed that these differences were not material. However, It was agreed that the Tribunal should refer to Egypt\u2019s Exhibit E5.\n\n**II. SUMMARY OF FACTS**\n------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThere was no real dispute as to the primary facts and the sequence of events relevant to the dispute as opposed to the inferences and legal conclusions to be drawn from those facts. It may be noted that Egypt did not submit a statement from any witness to counter the narrative of events from the Claimants and their witnesses relating to the Property and the Project.\n\n13.\n\nBased on facts which have been explicitly alleged by the Claimants and not disputed by Egypt, and the Tribunal\u2019s overall consideration of the evidence, both oral and documentary, the Tribunal makes the following findings of fact.14\n\nA chronology of the primary facts can be found in Appendix 1 to this Award.\n\n**Mr Waguih Elie George Siag - Background**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nMr Siag was born in Egypt on 12 March 1962 to Egyptian parents. He was, therefore, an Egyptian national from birth. On 19 December 1989 Mr Siag submitted an application for permission to acquire Lebanese nationality under Article 10 of the Nationality Law. Prior to submitting his application Mr Siag received a nationality certificate from the Lebanese Ministry of Interior on 15 December 1989 and a letter from the Lebanese Consulate in Cairo that he was \"of Lebanese nationality and recorded in the registers of this mission.\" On 5 March 1990 the Egyptian Minister of Interior issued his Decree No. 1353 of 1990 acknowledging Mr Siag\u2019s prior acquisition of Lebanese nationality and granting him permission to maintain his Egyptian nationality. On 8 March 1990 the Nationality Authority issued a letter to the Military Conscription Department to exempt Mr Siag from performing compulsory military service on the basis of his having dual-nationality. Mr Siag obtained a Lebanese passport on 14 June 1990. Mr Siag acquired Italian nationality on 3 May 1993 by decree of the Italian Minister of Interior. This was obtained on the basis of his marriage to an Italian citizen and the provisions of Article 5 of the Italian nationality law Number 91 of 1992. Mr Siag was issued with an Italian passport on 12 July 1995 and remains a citizen of Italy at the present time.\n\n15.\n\nIn his application for permission to acquire Lebanese nationality Mr Siag sought permission to maintain his Egyptian nationality pursuant to the third paragraph of Article 10 of the Nationality Law. As discussed at length in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, the third paragraph of Article 10 contains an additional requirement, once permission to maintain Egyptian nationality is granted, to further notify the Egyptian Interior Ministry within the period of one year of the desire to retain Egyptian nationality. Mr Siag did not so notify the Ministry with the consequence, as found in the Decision on Jurisdiction, that he lost his Egyptian nationality.\n\n**Mrs Clorinda Vecchi - Background**\n------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nMrs Clorinda Vecchi is the mother of Mr Siag. Mrs Vecchi was born in 1937 of parents who were Italian citizens and Mr Vecchi acquired Italian citizenship at birth. In 1954 Mrs Vecchi married Mr Elie George Siag, the father of Mr Siag. On 19 April 1955 Mrs Vecchi informed the Egyptian Interior Ministry that she wished to acquire the Egyptian citizenship of her husband. The Egyptian Minister of the Interior did not issue any decree preventing Mrs Vecchi from acquiring Egyptian nationality and Mrs Vecchi acquired Egyptian nationality on 19 April 1957. It appears that she then lost her Italian nationality.\n\n17.\n\nMrs Vecchi's marriage came to an end in 1987 upon the death of her husband, Mr Elie George Siag. Mrs Vecchi reacquired her Italian citizenship on 14 September 1993 by making a declaration under article 17 of the Italian Nationality Law No. 91 of 1992 which accords former Italian citizens the right to reacquire Italian nationality. Ms Vecchi's Italian nationality is not in dispute.\n\n**The Property and the Project**\n--------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nOn 4 January 1989, Egypt, through its Ministry of Tourism, sold the Property to Touristic Investments and Hotels Management Company (SIAG) S.A.E. (\"Siag Touristic\"). The Property is located on the Sinai Peninsula at the extreme northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea, 6 kilometres south of the Egyptian town of Taba and the border with Israel. It is 650,000 square metres (161 acres) in size and comprises approximately 1500 metres of coastline.\n\n19.\n\nSiag Touristic is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Egypt.\n\n20.\n\nOn 18 July 1992, Siag Touristic and its shareholders formed Siag Taba, a limited partnership under Egyptian law. Siag Touristic owns 75% of Siag Taba and each of the individual shareholders owns 5%. Siag Touristic transferred 150,000 square metres of the 650,000 square metre Property to Siag Taba as part of its share purchase.\n\n21.\n\nIn March and April of 1995, Mr Siag increased his ownership interest in Siag Touristic to 88.15% and Mrs Vecchi decreased her ownership interest to 10.5%. Mona Siag and the three children of Mr Siag hold the remaining 1.35% interest in Siag Touristic.\n\n22.\n\nThrough his shareholdings in Siag Touristic and Siag Taba, Mr Siag owns 84.22% of the Property. Mrs Vecchi owns 11.05% of the Property through her ownership interests in the two companies. Together, Claimants own 95.27% of the Property.\n\n23.\n\nThe Project which Claimants planned to implement on the Property was to consist of a resort with a capacity for 1,560 persons and certain related items of infrastructure, which were to be built in three phases following the grant of the necessary governmental approvals. Through their individual interests in Siag Touristic, Mr Siag and Mrs Vecchi respectively owned 88.15% and 10.5% of the Project. Together, Claimants therefore owned 98.65% of the Project.\n\n24.\n\nDuring the 1990 - 1994 period, Siag Touristic commenced basic construction work on the Property, including building a wall along the perimeter of the Property and installing a CalTex service station.\n\n25.\n\nOn 23 August 1994, Siag Touristic entered into an agreement (\"the Lumir Agreement\"), with an Israeli Company, Lumir Holdings Ltd to secure financing for a portion of the first phase of the Project.\n\n26.\n\nOn 28 March 1995, Mr Siag wrote to the Chairman of the Touristic Development Agency (\"TDA\"), a division of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism, to inform him about the financing which Siag had secured through the Lumir Agreement. Mr Siag\u2019s letter specifically stated that the Siag family \"owns the project with all its stock and has not and will not relinquish any shares to any person whether Egyptian or foreign.\"15\n\nLetter from Mr Siag to the Chairman of the TDA, dated 28 March 1995, Claimants\u2019 Exhibit 23.\n\n**The First Threat of Seizure by Egypt**\n----------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nImplementation of the Project suffered a number of delays.\n\n28.\n\nIn late 1994, the Nuweibaa City Council, a local governmental authority in the Taba area, issued a resolution to stop work on the Project, notwithstanding the fact that the Project site was outside the town\u2019s boundaries and not subject to local building approvals. On 16 February 1995, the Nuweibaa police attempted to implement the halt work order issued by the City Council by arresting Siag\u2019s workers. The matter was only resolved over one month later when the TDA write to the General in charge of Nuweibaa to instruct him to enable the Project to continue.16\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 27.\n\n29.\n\nOn 29 May 1995, the Chairman of the TDA, with the explicit approval of the Minister of Tourism, sent a notice to Mr Siag purporting to cancel the sale contract and ordering the return of the Property to the Government of Egypt. The reason behind this notice was Egypt\u2019s opposition to Siag\u2019s business relationship with the Israeli company Lumir. At a subsequent meeting with the Minister, Mr Siag was told the reason for the notice was Egypt\u2019s opposition to Siag\u2019s business relationship with the Israeli company Lumir.\n\n30.\n\nFaced with losing the Property and thus the Project if he did not terminate the Lumir Agreement, Mr Siag sent a letter to the Minister of Tourism (\"the Minister\") on 7 June 1995, confirming that he did not object to terminating the Lumir Agreement.\n\n31.\n\nOne week later, the Minister instructed the Chairman of the TDA to defer its seizure of the Property for one month, indicating that Mr Siag had \"submitted a written acknowledgment to cancel the contract with Lumir company.\"17\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 31.\n\n32.\n\nThe Lumir Agreement was terminated on 26 June 1995 and Mr Siag informed the Minister on 28 June 1995. Following these steps, the TDA did not seek to execute its May 1995 notice of seizure and in fact supported Mr Siag\u2019s application to the Arab Real Estate Bank for a loan.18\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 34.\n\n**Egypt\u2019s Expropriation of the Property by Ministerial Decree**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nSiag began construction of the buildings for phase one of the Project in the late Spring of 1995 and continued for approximately one year. Between May 1995 and May 1996, 8 apartment buildings with 288 individual apartments were constructed on the Property, with a capacity of 520 persons. The buildings were complete in terms of structure, electrical wiring and plumbing and most of the paintwork on the walls and ceilings had also been completed. Some of the finishing works on the buildings, such as the installation of windows, doors, marble and furnishings, remained to be completed. Infrastructural items such as water and sewage piping beyond the buildings also remained to be built. Landscaping had been commenced as well as pre-foundation work for roads.\n\n34.\n\nDuring the same period, work was also begun on the construction of buildings for phase two of the Project. The foundations for two more apartment buildings had been laid and the construction of 12 luxury villas was well underway.\n\n35.\n\nOn 23 April 1996, the TDA sent Mr Siag a letter claiming that a March 1996 inspection had revealed a lack of progress on the Project. The letter further informed Mr Siag that the TDA would terminate the contract if the Project was not \"opened\" by the end of 1996.19 In reply, Mr Siag sent a letter to the TDA dated 9 May 1996 confirming that Siag would complete phase one of the Project by the end of 1996.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 37.\n\n36.\n\nOn 23 May 1996, the Egyptian Minister of Tourism issued Ministerial Resolution Number 83 for the Year 1996, cancelling the Contract and redeeming \"all the land, subject of this contract with all the structures thereon...\" The Resolution relied in particular on a report submitted by the Chairman of the executive body of the General Authority for Touristic Development concerning Siag\u2019s \"failure...to honour its commitments stipulated in the mentioned contract on time.\"\n\n37.\n\nNotwithstanding the express provisions contained in Article 1 of the said Ministerial Resolution, which stated that all interested parties would be informed, the decree was never notified to Mr Siag by Egypt. Instead, Mr Siag learned that Egypt was expropriating the Property from the Chairman of the Arab Real Estate Bank, which immediately halted its financing of the Project.\n\n38.\n\nThree days after Resolution n\u00b0 83 had been issued and in apparent contradiction of the Resolution, the TDA engineers in charge of overseeing implementation of the Project sent a letter to Mr Siag informing him that they would be carrying out a site inspection at the Property on 2 June 1996 to monitor progress on the Project. In that same letter, the TDA further assured Mr Siag \"that the Authority for Touristic Development has pledged all its resources to serving the project in order to fulfil its desired objectives.\"\n\n39.\n\nOn 2 June 1996, Mr Siag was informed by the Brigadier in charge of the Nuweibaa police precinct south of Taba that the police were preparing to execute Resolution n\u00b0 83 by seizing the Property and all materials on the site.\n\n40.\n\nUpon his arrival at the Nuweibaa police headquarters on 2 June 1996, Mr Siag, who was accompanied by several senior advisors, met with the police officer in charge of the matter, Captain Abou Zeid Mohamed. In the course of discussions, Dr Abou Zeid, Mr Siag\u2019s attorney, specifically requested the protection of the police and the district attorney in safeguarding Siag\u2019s rights.\n\n41.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, Captain Mohamed asked Mr Siag whether he would agree to or oppose the execution of Resolution n\u00b0 83. Mr Siag stated that he would oppose it, and was immediately arrested by Captain Mohamed. It was initially ordered that Mr Siag spend the night in jail and be transported to the District Attorney\u2019s office in El Tor, some 300 kilometres away, the following morning. However, Mr Siag was later released, although still under arrest, and required to report in person to the District Attorney\u2019s office the next day.\n\n42.\n\nFollowing a meeting at the District Attorney\u2019s office on 4 June 1996, Mr Siag was released from custody.\n\n**The First Court Decision**\n----------------------------\n\n43.\n\nOn 10 June 1996, Siag filed suit against the Minister of Tourism\u2019s decree in the Administrative Court in Cairo (Contracts and Compensations circuit), seeking an immediate injection against Resolution n\u00b0 83 and a ruling on the merits that the decree was invalid and unenforceable under Egyptian law.\n\n44.\n\nOn 20 June 1996, 4 days after the preliminary court hearing and 3 days before the second hearing, a governmental force seized the Property, which was handed over to the TDA.\n\n45.\n\nOn 21 July 1996, the Cairo Administrative Court found as follows:\n\n\"[the] Resolution is illegal for being issued before the expiration of the deadline set for the completion of the first phase of the project according to the contract concluded between the Ministry and the plaintiff company.... In addition the decree included taking the land together with all constructions thereupon, which are valued at millions of Egyptian pounds... Consequently, this decision involved confiscation of the plaintiff company\u2019s money,... and this is in violation of the provisions of Article 36 of the Constitution, which stipulates \"Public confiscation of money is prohibited, and the private confiscation is permissible only by virtue of a judicial ruling.\"20\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 45.\n\n46.\n\nOn 18 August 1996, the Administrative Court, having learned that the Government had challenged the injunction in a civil court in Cairo, enjoined the civil court action and ordered that its own July decision be executed.\n\n**The Second Seizure of the Property by Egypt**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nSiag returned to the Property on 19 August 1996 and took possession of the site.\n\n48.\n\nThis situation lasted for 36 hours only. On 21 August 1996, Government security forces and the TDA forcibly seized the Property for the second time. During the second seizure operations, the police severely beat one of Mr Siag\u2019s employees, Mr Mostafa Mohamed Sayed Ahmed, who subsequently required hospital care. Three of the lawyers who had executed the Administrative Court\u2019s injunction in favour of Siag were also arrested.\n\n**The Second Court Decision**\n-----------------------------\n\n49.\n\nIn September 1996, the Government of Egypt appealed the Administrative Court\u2019s injunction to the Supreme Administrative Court of the State Council (\"the Supreme Administrative Court\").\n\n50.\n\nIt may be noted in passing that in their pleadings, the Government\u2019s lawyers submitted that the Government had been forced to cancel the Contract and seize the Property because Mr Siag \"had sold the project, almost completely, to the Israelis.\"21\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 46.\n\n51.\n\nThe Government further contended that Mr Siag has \"ignored all patriotic considerations...and violated the trust given to him by the state and contracted with an Israeli company, unaware of the seriousness of the violation by contracting with an Israeli foreign company to share with him in implementing the project, or rather to swallow almost the whole project...,\"22\n\nIbid.\n\n52.\n\nOn 16 October 1996, the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the Government\u2019s request to halt execution of the lower court\u2019s injunction.23\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 48.\n\n53.\n\nOn 5 February 1997, the Supreme Administrative Court also unanimously dismissed the Government\u2019s appeal and affirmed the injunction issued by the Administrative Court.\n\n54.\n\nDespite these two decisions, no steps were taken by Egypt to return the Property or the Project to Mr Siag.\n\n**The Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s Decision on the Merits**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe judicial proceedings then shifted to the merits of the claim brought by Siag.\n\n56.\n\nOn 31 May 1998, the Administrative Court requested the Dean of the Engineering Faculty at Cairo University to appoint an impartial panel of engineering experts to assist the Court in analyzing the merits of the case.\n\n57.\n\nIn a report delivered to the Administrative Court in October 1998, the expert panel concluded that between 1990 and 1995, the Project had been delayed by several significant events of *force majeure* (the First Gulf War, flooding and terrorism), lack of coordination among governmental entities and serious delays by the authorities responsible for approving the environmental study and the engineering plans for the first phase.\n\n58.\n\nThe panel also found that the deadline for completion of phase one of the Project was the end of 1996 and that Siag could have finished the first phase of the Project by that date.\n\n59.\n\nOn 7 September 1999, the Court, composed of different judges from those who had originally enjoined the Minister of Tourism\u2019s decree, found in favour of the Government, ignoring the expert panel\u2019s report.\n\n60.\n\nSiag appealed this judgment to the Supreme Administrative Court, requesting an immediate stay of execution and that the decision be overturned on the merits.\n\n61.\n\nOn 21 June 2000, the Supreme Administrative Court issued a unanimous ruling that stayed the lower court\u2019s decision.24\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 50.\n\n62.\n\nOn 7 August 2001, the Supreme Administrative Court reversed the lower court\u2019s decision on the merits, holding that Resolution n\u00b0 83 was illegal and cancelling it. The Supreme Administrative Court also found that the Contract was valid, binding and effective and should not have been repudiated by the Government.\n\n63.\n\nThe dispositive section of the Judgment provided as follows:\n\n\"The court rules as follows:\n\nTo accept the appeal in form; and, on the merits, to cancel the lower court\u2019s ruling and to cancel the challenged resolution of the Minister of Tourism number 83 for the year 1996, with the resulting effects, including considering the contract entered into with the appellant on January 4, 1989 as valid and effective. The administrative entity is committed to pay the expenses relating to both Court judgments.\n\nThe concerned Ministers and heads of departments shall assist in implementing [this ruling] by force if requested to.\"25\n\nIbid.\n\n64.\n\nWhen taken in conjunction with its two earlier affirmations of the injunction against the execution of Resolution n\u00b0 83 and its stay of the lower court\u2019s ruling on the merits, the August 2001 judgment was the fourth ruling is Siag\u2019s favour by Egypt\u2019s Supreme Administrative Court.\n\n**The Minister of Tourism\u2019s New Resolution and the Administrative Court\u2019s Decision**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nEgypt ignored the decision issued by its highest administrative jurisdiction.\n\n66.\n\nOn 8 September 2001, one month after the abovementioned ruling, The Minister of Tourism promulgated another decree, Resolution Number 279 for the Year 2001, cancelling the Contract with Siag.\n\n67.\n\nOn 31 October 2001, Mr Siag filed another lawsuit against the Government in the Administrative Court in Cairo to enjoin this new decree and have it overturned on the merits.\n\n68.\n\nThe Government\u2019s defence once again was based on Siag\u2019s relationship with Lumir and stated, as elements of fact, the following:\n\n\"Those who believe that Israel is a disaster that has struck upon the Palestinian people only, and that Israel\u2019s premeditated aggression and expansion do not exceed Palestine, are not aware of the Zionist movement and its aims and broader plans. In fact, the Israeli danger threatens the historical and cultural entity of the Arab Nation. Israel represents a material danger that threatens all neighbouring countries with invasion, aggression and occupation in all its types.\n\nPerhaps, the researcher of the historical roots of the expansionist Zionist aspirations and the ideological and planning framework of Israeli aggression, and the motives behind the formation of the Zionist idea and its growth, is able to expose the expansionist aims of Israel, so that Arabs are aware of the Zionist intentions and work toward protecting their countries from the Israeli invasion.\n\n**In the Name of God, the Most Benign, the Merciful**\n\n\"You will surely find the people most severe to those who believe are the Jews and those who associate other gods with God\"\n\n**True are the words of God\"** [emphasis in original].26\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 52.\n\n69.\n\nThe Government\u2019s pleadings then presented a series of arguments the general tenor of which can be illustrated by the following excerpt:\n\n\"Taba, the pure part of Egypt that has been returned back to its motherland after three military, legal and diplomatic wars. The claimant of the present case intended to sell this land \"Taba\" to the Zionistic entity and bring the Jews back to stain it again, and he had received Millions of Dollars in return for this. But Egypt - represented in the Ministry of Tourism and the public Authority for Touristic Development - has doomed all his intentions, and disappointed the claimant and his far from patriotic purposes....\"27\n\nIbid.\n\n70.\n\nOn 28 March 2002, the Court rejected Egypt\u2019s contentions and granted Siag\u2019s request to enjoin execution of Resolution n\u00b0 279, ruling that the decree had been illegally issued (Claimants\u2019 exhibit 53). The Court also held that the degree of urgency required for injunctive relief was present, since the Minister had already expropriated the Project five years earlier by his Resolution n\u00b0 83 that was \"finally cancelled by a final ruling.\"\n\n71.\n\nThe TDA contested this decision and requested a stay of the Court\u2019s judgment, but this was in turn rejected on 6 June 2002.28\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 54.\n\n**Egypt\u2019s Unsuccessful Appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe TDA and the Ministry of Tourism then appealed the Administrative Court\u2019s decision enjoining Resolution n\u00b0 279 to the Supreme Administrative Court.\n\n73.\n\nIn its Appeal, the Government once again argued that any damages suffered by Mr Siag paled in comparison to those that Egypt would have suffered had it not seized the Property:\n\n\"There is no doubt that protecting the lands of our country from the filth of the Jews and the greed of the Zionist movement and Israel\u2019s expansionist dreams, and publicly disclosing the objectives of the Appellee and preventing him from selling the land subject matter of the contract, and other political, historical and legal considerations, make the position of the administrative authority in the best interest of the country and its security, and render the damages that may be suffered by the Appellee worthless when compared to the resolution\u2019s great promotion of the public interest.\"29\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 55.\n\n74.\n\nOn 24 May 2005, the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the Appeal and ruled in favour of Siag for the fifth time. The Court found that Siag \"did not sell or assign any part of the land to the Israeli company\" as claimed by Egypt and it held that the TDA\u2019s interpretation of the Lumir Agreement was \"contrary to [the] apparent and clear meaning\" of the Agreement\u2019s text. The Court further noted that Siag had terminated the Lumir Agreement in 1995 and that the Government had not provided any evidence to the contrary. The Court therefore dismissed the Appeal on the grounds that it was not \"legitimate\" and \"lack(ed] any legal or factual support.\"30\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 56.\n\n75.\n\nAs was the case with all of the preceding judgments, Egypt failed to comply with the May 2005 ruling of the Supreme Administrative Court and took no steps to return the Property to Siag or to recognise the Contract.\n\n**Seizures of the Property by the President and Prime Minister of Egypt and the Transfer of the Property to Al-Sharq Gas Company**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nOn 15 July 2002, less than four months after the Administrative Court\u2019s decision dated 28 March 2002, the President of Egypt issued a decree to expropriate the Property. This Presidential decree n\u00b0 205 of 2002 purported to allocate the Property \"to public benefit\" and provided that the Property could only be used as instructed by the Prime Minister.\n\n77.\n\nMr Siag challenged this decree in another lawsuit filed with the Administrative Court in Cairo. However, on 24 February 2003, before the case could be heard, the Prime Minister issued another governmental decree to expropriate the Property.\n\n78.\n\nPrime Ministerial Resolution n\u00b0 315 classified the project of constructing a land natural gas line Areesh/Taba and the beginning of a maritime natural gas line Taba/Aqaba as \"a public benefit work.\" As such, it assigned to Al-Sharq Gas Company the piece of land \"concerning which the presidential resolution number 205 for the year 2002 was issued.\"\n\n79.\n\nAs was the case with the presidential decree n\u00b0 205, Resolution n\u00b0 315 made no mention whatsoever of Siag, the Contract or the Project and did not mention any of the decisions rendered by the Administrative Courts and the Supreme Administrative Court.\n\n80.\n\nOn 16 March 2003, the TDA handed over the entire site, including the Property, the buildings constructed by Siag, the petrol station and all of Siag\u2019s equipment, to Al-Sharq Gas Company.\n\n**A New Decision of the Administrative Court**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nOn 27 April 2003, following Siag\u2019s challenges to both Presidential Decree n\u00b0 205 and the Prime Minister\u2019s Resolution n\u00b0 315, the Administrative Court held that by virtue of its sale to Siag, the Property had \"moved out of the scope of State property\" and had become the personal property of Siag. It further found that the two Resolutions had been issued and executed \"in violation of Article 5 of Law n\u00b0 07/1991.\"\n\n82.\n\nAgain, Egypt took no steps to comply with the Court\u2019s judgment and Al-Sharq Gas Company retained possession of the Property and proceeded to construct a pipeline and associated facilities.\n\n**Prime Ministerial Resolution n\u00b0 799**\n---------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThree weeks after the Administrative Court\u2019s decision, the Prime Minister issued yet another decree to expropriate the Property (Resolution n\u00b0 799), containing almost identical provisions to those which had already been judged illegal by the Court.\n\n84.\n\nThis new decree was challenged by Siag in the Administrative Court in Cairo. This time, Mr Siag\u2019s suit was unsuccessful but a request for reconsideration and an appeal were filed.\n\n**The Sinai Litigation**\n------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe \"Sinai Litigation\" originated with the Suez Attorney-General\u2019s Order to return the property to Siag. This Order was made on the basis of an investigation following Mr Siag\u2019s testimony at the District Attorney\u2019s Office in El Tor on 4 June 1996.31 That investigation concluded that Siag was indeed the rightful owner of the Property and, accordingly, on 24 August 1999, the Chancellor and Attorney General of Suez and South Sinai issued an order to return the Property to Siag.\n\nSee para. 41 above.\n\n86.\n\nEgypt then filed a lawsuit against the Order and, on 28 May 2000, the El Tor Summary Court of South Sinai ruled in favour of the Government. Mr Siag appealed that Judgment which was overturned by the Civil Appeals Circuit Court on 24 March 2002.32\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 64.\n\n87.\n\nEgypt did not comply with this new Judgment. Instead it filed three separate challenges. These were all rejected by the courts. However, Egypt did not thereafter recognise the decision of the Civil Appeals Circuit Court and acted without regard to the fact that its challenges had failed.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY UP TO SEPTEMBER 2007 INCLUDING THE DECISION ON JURISDICTION OF 11 APRIL 2007**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Registration of the Request for Arbitration**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nOn 26 May 2005, Mr Siag and Ms Vecchi filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") a Request for Arbitration (\"the Request\") directed against Egypt. The Request invoked Article 9 of the BIT, which imported the ICSID arbitration provisions. The Claimants argued in the Request that Egypt had consented to ICSID arbitration of disputes such as the Claimants\u2019 dispute as to their investment in Siag Touristic by virtue of signing and ratifying the BIT.\n\n89.\n\nOn 2 June 2005 ICSID, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Rules\"), acknowledged receipt of the Request and on the same day transmitted a copy to Egypt and to the Egyptian embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n90.\n\nBy a letter to ICSID dated 29 June 2005, Egypt objected to the registration of the Request on the grounds that the dispute was outside the jurisdiction of ICSID. The Claimants responded by letter of 8 July 2005, stating that the objections raised by Egypt were without merit. ICSID received further correspondence on this issue from Egypt dated 1 August 2005 and from the Claimants dated 4 August 2005.\n\n91.\n\nThe Request was registered by the Centre on 5 August 2005, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\"). On the same day the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n**Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and Commencement of the Proceeding**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal was established under the ICSID Convention as follows. Following the registration of the Request by the Centre, the parties agreed on a three-member Tribunal. The parties agreed that each would appoint an arbitrator and that the third arbitrator, who would be the president of the Tribunal, would be appointed by agreement of the two party appointed arbitrators.\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimants appointed Professor Michael Pryles, a national of Australia, of Level 18, 333 Collins Street, Melbourne, Australia and Egypt appointed Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a national of Chile, of Abenida El Golf 40, Piso 6, Santiago, Chile.\n\n94.\n\nProfessor Pryles and Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a together appointed as President of the Tribunal Mr David A R Williams QC, a national of New Zealand, of Bankside Chambers, Level 22, 88 Shortland Street, Auckland, New Zealand.\n\n95.\n\nAll three arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Centre by a letter of 10 January 2006 informed the parties of the constitution of the Tribunal, and that the proceeding was deemed to have commenced on that day, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules.\n\n**Written and Oral Procedure**\n------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nAfter consulting with the parties and the Centre the Tribunal scheduled a first session in Pahs for 24 March 2006, in accordance with ICSID Rule 13(1).\n\n97.\n\nAt the first session of the Tribunal the procedural issues were discussed and agreed. All conclusions reached were reflected in the written minutes of the session. It was agreed that Egypt\u2019s objections to jurisdiction would be treated as preliminary questions. A schedule for the filing of memorials and for the holding of a hearing on jurisdiction in Pahs on 8-9 August 2006 was agreed.\n\n98.\n\nIt was agreed at the first session that the Claimants would file their Memorial on the Merits in advance of any objections to jurisdiction Egypt wished to file.\n\n99.\n\nPursuant to the agreed schedule the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits on 12 May 2006 along with the Witness Statements of Waguih Elie George Siag dated 8 May 2006 and Dr Mustafa Abou Zeid Fahmy dated 2 May 2006.\n\n100.\n\nThe parties then made submissions on Egypt\u2019s objections to jurisdiction, as summarised below.33\n\nThe parties\u2019 submissions on jurisdiction were summarised in the Decision on Jurisdiction of 11 April 2007.\n\n101.\n\nEgypt filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction on 12 June 2006, along with the Expert Opinion of Dr Hafiza El Haddad and the Joint Expert Opinion of Professor Dr Mohamed El-Said El-Dakkak and Professor Dr Okasha Mohamed Abdel Aal.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants submitted a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on12 July 2006 supported by the Expert Opinion of Professor Fouad A Riad dated 10 July 2006 and the Expert Opinion of Professor W Michael Reisman dated 12 July 2006.\n\n103.\n\nEgypt filed a Reply on Jurisdiction on 24 July 2006 together with a Supplementary Expert Opinion of Dr Hafiza El Haddad dated 24 July 2006.\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on 4 August 2006 along with a second Expert Opinion of Professor Fouad A Riad dated 1 August 2006 and a second Expert Opinion of Professor W Michael Reisman dated 31 July 2006.\n\n105.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction was held in Pahs on 8-9 August 2006. Attending for the Claimants were Mr Reginald Smith, Mr Kenneth Fleuriet and Mr R Doak Bishop, all of the law firm King & Spalding. Attending on behalf of Egypt were Counsellor Milad Sidhom Boutros, President of the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority (\"ESLA\"), Counsellor Hussein Mustafa Fathi of ESLA, Mr Asser Harb of ESLA, Counsellor Ahmed Amin Hassan and Mr Mohamed Abel Aal from the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism, and Professor Dr Kamal Aboulmagd, Mr Hazem Abdel Ghafar Rezkana and Mr Hatem Zien Aldien Darwish from the law firm Helmy, Hamza & Partners/Baker & McKenzie. Mr Smith, Mr Fleuriet and Mr Bishop each addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants, and Dr Aboulmagd and Mr Rezkana addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Egypt.34 No witnesses were called for cross-examination. Counsel for both parties presented oral submissions and answered questions from members of the Tribunal.\n\nMr Lawrence Newman, Mr Scott Hutchins and Mr Joshua Schopf of Baker & McKenzie, LLP, New York, were not part of Egypt\u2019s legal team at this stage.\n\n106.\n\nOn 29 August 2006 Egypt filed its Post-Hearing Submission on jurisdiction. The Claimants submitted their Post-Hearing submission on 11 September 2006.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction dated 11 April 2007, accompanied by the partial dissenting opinion of Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a (in respect of the conclusions reached in respect of Mr. Siag). The Tribunal, having examined the parties\u2019 respective submissions on jurisdiction, decided that the dispute was within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal and should proceed to the merits. The essence of the Tribunal\u2019s ruling was that both Claimants were Italian nationals and were not Egyptian nationals, and that both thereby satisfied the positive and negative nationality requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal found that the estoppel arguments raised by Egypt as objections to jurisdiction were more properly matters for the merits of the dispute. The Tribunal held that the costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the ICSID Secretariat, were reserved for further consideration and subsequent determination.\n\n108.\n\nThe Decision on Jurisdiction is hereby incorporated into the present Award and made an integral part of it. Egypt\u2019s subsequent jurisdictional objections, which were first raised almost five months after the Tribunal issued its aforementioned Decision, are addressed below.\n\n109.\n\nOn 5 June 2007 the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.1, setting out a timetable for further submissions on the merits (in addition to Claimants\u2019 Memorial which had already been filed) and on damages, culminating in a hearing on the merits in Pahs in March 2008.\n\n110.\n\nAround that time Mr Lawrence Newman, Mr Scott Hutchins and Mr Joshua Schopf of Baker & McKenzie joined the team of lawyers representing Egypt.\n\n111.\n\nThereafter there developed a pattern of applications by Egypt under which it sought to raise further jurisdictional objections. Since ICSID Rule 41(1) provides that jurisdictional objections must be made as early as possible, and since Claimants vigorously challenged Egypt\u2019s right to mount these further jurisdictional objections, it is necessary to record in detail the timing and the content of those further challenges.\n\n112.\n\nIn addition to the parties\u2019 scheduled submissions on the merits and quantum several further applications were made by Egypt. These were: an application to bifurcate the merits phase, two further objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and an application to discontinue the claim of Mrs Vecchi. Egypt\u2019s application to bifurcate the merits phase has been determined by the Tribunal, as outlined below. Egypt\u2019s further objections to jurisdiction, and the case on the merits, have not yet been determined and are the subject of this Award.\n\n**Egypt\u2019s Application for Bifurcation of the Merits Phase by First Hearing Egypt\u2019s Estoppel Arguments**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nOn 25 June 2007, as part of its Reply to Claimants\u2019 Response to Egypt\u2019s request for documents, Egypt stated that it intended to show, in the merits phase of the arbitration, that both Claimants were estopped from denying their respective Egyptian nationalities.35 Egypt submitted that it made sense to hear and determine its case on estoppel before the remainder of the merits were considered, and asked the Tribunal to \"divide the forthcoming merits phase of this case into two sub-phases, the first of them being the estoppel arguments of Egypt.\"36 Egypt noted that it had obtained expert reports from Professors Hans Smit and Ivan Shearer in support of its arguments on estoppel.\n\nEgypt\u2019s \"Reply to Claimants\u2019 Response on Egypt\u2019s Discovery Request,\" p. 2.\n\nIbid.\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimants responded to Egypt\u2019s request for bifurcation on 3 July 2007, submitting that Egypt\u2019s request was an attempt to re-argue previously determined jurisdictional issues (particularly the issue of effective nationality) under the guise of estoppel, and should be rejected. Claimants stated that their Italian nationalities, and their loss of Egyptian nationalities, were both *res judicata.37* Claimants further submitted that Egypt had not articulated a legitimate issue of estoppel but that if it intended to do so it would have ample opportunity in its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder, at the hearing, and in its Post-hearing Memorial.38 Claimants asked that Egypt\u2019s request for bifurcation be rejected.\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter of 3 July 2007, p. 2.\n\nIbid., p. 3.\n\n115.\n\nEgypt replied to Claimants\u2019 submissions on bifurcation on 8 July 2007. Egypt noted that while it would abide by the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction, it nevertheless retained the right to fully argue its case on estoppel, which remained an issue separable from the question of jurisdiction.39 Egypt repeated its request that the Tribunal \"address the question of \"estoppel\" in the first stage of the second phase of the proceedings.\"40\n\nRespondent\u2019s \"Response to Claimants\u2019 Letter Dated July 3, 2007,\" p. 2.\n\nIbid.\n\n116.\n\nOn 21 August 2007 the Tribunal issued its decision on Egypt\u2019s request for bifurcation of the merits phase of the arbitration.41 The salient sections of the Order were as follows:\n\n13. \"It was agreed at the first session of the Tribunal that jurisdiction would be determined as a preliminary question, before the merits were considered. It was not suggested that the arbitration be bifurcated between issues of liability and damages. The Tribunal considers that it was clearly implicit that the arbitration would only be split between jurisdiction as a preliminary issue and \u2018all merits and damages issues\u2019 thereafter.\n\n14. The Tribunal therefore considers that Egypt\u2019s request that estoppel be determined separately from the balance of the merits issues is a new proposal. It runs counter to the earlier submissions by the parties, to the agreement reached at the first session, to Egypt\u2019s originally proposed timetable for the hearing on the merits and to the timetable directed by Procedural Order no.1 for a single determination of merits-related issues.\n\n15. Egypt is correct in stating that it should be afforded the opportunity to fully present its case on estoppel, however that opportunity need not be given effect through the bifurcation of the merits phase. The Claimants\u2019 submission that Egypt will have full opportunity to run its estoppel argument as part of the wider merits phase is convincing.\n\n16. It should also be noted as a matter of practical concern that the members of the Tribunal would not in any case be in a position to offer a hearing on estoppel prior to the hearing on the merits in March 2008.\n\n17. The ICSID Arbitration Rules do not expressly preclude the bifurcation of the merits phase of an ICSID arbitration. It is not however the usual practice of ICSID Tribunals to do so. The Tribunal considers that it would require compelling reasons to order such a bifurcation, particularly when, as is the case here, it was previously agreed that the merits phase would be heard as a whole, and a timetable had been directed to give effect to that agreement. The Tribunal does not consider that such compelling reasons are present in this case.\n\n18. Egypt\u2019s request that its arguments on estoppel be heard as a separate and preliminary issue to the remainder of the issues on merits and damages is accordingly refused. Arguments on estoppel will be considered as part of the general merits phase, pursuant to the timetable set down in Procedural Order no.1.\"\n\nProcedural Order No. 3.\n\n**IV. EGYPT\u2019S SEPTEMBER 2007 OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION BASED ON MR SIAG\u2019S ALLEGED BANKRUPTCY**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The Parties\u2019 Submissions on Egypt\u2019s Bankruptcy Application**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEgypt\u2019s Initial Application\n---------------------------\n\n117.\n\nOn 6 September 2007, almost five months after the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, Egypt filed a \"Notification and Application Concerning Objection to the Centre Subject Matter Jurisdiction over This Proceeding.\" Egypt\u2019s application claimed that it had recently discovered that Waguih Siag had been declared bankrupt on 16 January 1999, with retroactive effect from 20 August 1994,42 as a result of a debt of 23,545.16 Egyptian Pounds owed to Mr Alaa El Din Abdel Rahman Sayed Youssef. Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy had not been discharged.43 A court-appointed trustee, Mr Mohamed Ismail Mohamed, was invested on 16 January 1999 with the control of the bankrupt estate, including the personal assets of Mr Siag. Egypt affixed to its application a decision of the Cairo Court of Appeal dated 16 January 1999 stating that \"a bankruptcy ruling must be issued\" and \"declaring Siag Pyramids Hotel Company as well as the two joint partners Waguih George Siag and Ramy George Siag as bankrupt.\" Egypt also adduced a certificate from the Giza Court of First Instance dated 15 August 2007 to the effect that \"the procedures of the Claim shall continue to be deliberated during the hearing session of 1 November 2007....\"\n\nThis being the date upon which the Court considered that Mr Siag (as a \"joint partner\" of the Siag Pyramids Hotel) had ceased to pay his debts.\n\nRespondent\u2019s application of 6 September 2007, p. 2.\n\n118.\n\nEgypt contended that, under Egyptian bankruptcy law Mr Siag, from the date he became bankrupt in 1999, could no longer validly agree to arbitrate any dispute relating to any asset forming part of the bankruptcy estate.44 Egypt argued that at the time the Request for Arbitration was lodged in 2005 Mr Siag therefore lacked the capacity to arbitrate the dispute.45 Mr Siag also lacked capacity to maintain the present arbitration.46 Egypt therefore objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and asked that the proceedings be suspended while Egypt\u2019s objections were determined as preliminary questions.47\n\nIbid., pp. 2-3.\n\nEgypt\u2019s application of 6 September 2007, p. 3.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., p. 5.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response\n-------------------\n\n119.\n\nClaimants responded to Egypt\u2019s application on 11 September 2007, submitting that the Tribunal had already determined matters of jurisdiction in its Decision on Jurisdiction of 11 April 2007. Claimants argued that Egypt had no right to seek to resuspend the merits phase of the case in order to further argue jurisdictional issues. Egypt would have ample opportunity to make its submissions on bankruptcy as part of its arguments on the merits.48 Claimants submitted that the Tribunal should accordingly reject Egypt\u2019s application to suspend the merits phase of the arbitration.\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 11 September 2007, pp. 2-3.\n\n120.\n\nClaimants further submitted that the claim that Egypt had only recently discovered the bankruptcy order was particularly dubious. The Egyptian courts were part of the Egyptian state under international law and Egypt had therefore been fully aware of the alleged bankruptcy since January 1999.49 Further, the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority (\"ESLA\") had argued the same bankruptcy issue on behalf of the Egyptian Government before the Cairo Administrative Court when Siag Touristic and Siag Taba challenged the first expropriation decree. Egypt accordingly had not only constructive but actual knowledge of the bankruptcy issue at a much earlier stage.50\n\nIbid., p. 3.\n\nIbid., p. 3 n 2.\n\n121.\n\nIt was also submitted by Claimants that, in any event, \"Egypt\u2019s allegation that the \"bankruptcy order\" has not been discharged as to this date...is false.\"51 According to Claimants, the debt that occasioned Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy had since been repaid, and the bankruptcy proceedings had been closed on 24 June 1999.52 Claimants attached to their submission an Order of the Giza Court dated 24 June 1999 noting that Mr Siag had been declared bankrupt on 16 January 1999, but that the debt had since been repaid, and that the Court \"...decides to close the bankruptcy proceedings.\"\n\nIbid., p. 3.\n\nIbid.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Further Submissions\n---------------------------\n\n122.\n\nEgypt wrote to the Tribunal on 13 September 2007, stating for the first time that, contrary to Claimants\u2019 assertion, Mr Siag had not been discharged because the bankruptcy had been \"re-opened\" in 2003. Egypt stated that it would shortly provide evidence in support of these contentions.\n\n123.\n\nEgypt made further submissions on 24 September 2007, arguing that the bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Siag \"are still pending and are not closed....\" Although Egypt accepted that the proceedings had been closed on 24 June 1999, it contended that they had been re-opened in 2003 when further debts, due to the Arab African International Bank (\"AAIB\"), Cairo Airport Authority, and El Shams Company were submitted.53 The bankruptcy proceedings had been ongoing since they were reopened in 2003. Mr Siag had not been discharged from the bankruptcy proceedings since that time.54 Accordingly Mr Siag\u2019s lack of capacity to initiate arbitration proceedings could not be denied.55 The Tribunal ought to reconsider the legality of Mr Siag\u2019s standing.\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions of 24 September 2007, p. 1 and annexures.\n\nIbid., p. 2.\n\nIbid., p. 3.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Further Submissions\n------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nClaimants made further submissions on 26 September 2007, arguing that the issues raised by Egypt in relation to Mr Siag\u2019s capacity were governed exclusively by international law, and were unaffected by Egypt\u2019s domestic laws. If the domestic laws of any country were relevant it would be the laws of Italy, as it was as a national of that country that Mr Siag brought his dispute to ICSID.56 Only one ICSID Tribunal in the Claimants\u2019 knowledge had re-suspended the merits phase of an arbitration following a decision on jurisdiction, and that was in exceptional circumstances.57\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 26 September 2007, p. 2.\n\nIbid.\n\nProcedural Order No. 5\n----------------------\n\n125.\n\nOn 27 September 2007 the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 5 in respect of Egypt\u2019s application. The text of that Order is reproduced below.\n\n1. \"The Tribunal has received and perused the letters and submissions relating to the Respondent\u2019s application for a stay of proceedings, comprising Egypt\u2019s application of 6 September 2007, Claimants\u2019 response of 11 September, Egypt\u2019s reply of 13 September, Egypt\u2019s further submissions of 24 September, and Claimants\u2019 further submissions of 26 September.\n\n2. The Tribunal now issues the following directions:\n\nA. The Respondent shall file a formal application for a suspension/stay of the proceedings. In that Application:\n\n(1) It must state the precise orders it seeks and against which of the Claimants;\n\n(2) It may annex to its application the letters already sent to the Tribunal in relation to its stay application;\n\n(3) It may provide further evidence or submissions in support of its application;\n\n(4) It must provide appropriate reference to the relevant bankruptcy laws of Egypt;\n\n(5) It must explain the late pursuit of this application and also address the question of whether or not the matters it relies upon were reasonably discoverable at an earlier stage of these arbitral proceedings, and in particular during the jurisdictional phase which concluded with the delivery of the Tribunal\u2019s Award on jurisdiction;\n\n(6) It must lodge the Application no later than 14 days from the date of receipt of this Procedural Order.\n\nB. No later than 14 days after receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Application and supporting materials under A the Claimants shall file an answer in opposition to the Application. In the Answer:\n\n(1) Claimants must state the precise orders they seek;\n\n(2) They may annex to their application the letters already sent to the Tribunal;\n\n(3) They may provide further evidence or submissions in support of their Answer;\n\n(4) They must make appropriate reference to the relevant bankruptcy laws of Egypt.\n\nC. Thereafter the Respondent may file a brief rejoinder within 7 days of receipt of Claimants\u2019 Answer.\n\n3. After considering the foregoing materials the Tribunal will decide:\n\n(a) whether or not to suspend the proceedings in whole or in part; and/or\n\n(b) what other procedural rulings, if any, are appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n4. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, NOTHING IN THIS ORDER AFFECTS IN ANY WAY THE CURRENT PROCEDURAL TIMETABLE WHICH MUST CONTINUE TO BE OBSERVED IN ALL RESPECTS.\"\n\n126.\n\nOn 5 October 2007 the Tribunal through its Secretary notified the parties that Egypt\u2019s formal application on the issue of Mr Siag\u2019s alleged bankruptcy was now due on 18 October 2007, with Claimants\u2019 Reply due by 1 November 2007 and Egypt\u2019s Rejoinder by 8 November 2007.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Formal Application\n--------------------------\n\n127.\n\nEgypt subsequently filed its Application for Suspension of the Merits and Objection to Jurisdiction dated 18 October 2007, together with exhibits. Egypt repeated its earlier submissions on the issue of bankruptcy, as well as making additional submissions.\n\n128.\n\nEgypt\u2019s additional submissions began by arguing that ICSID Rule 41 (3)58 provided that \"upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the proceeding on the merits shall be suspended.\" Egypt accordingly requested that the merits phase of the case be suspended pending the outcome of its application.59 Egypt further submitted that there was no central bankruptcy register in Egypt and as a result Egypt had no knowledge of Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy at the time of the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. Egypt therefore could not have addressed the issue at that time. The knowledge of the Egyptian courts could not be attributed to Egypt under the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"The ILC Articles\") because the judgment declaring Mr Siag bankrupt was not an internationally wrongful act, to which the scope of the ILC Articles was limited.60 Egypt was under no duty to second-guess Mr Siag\u2019s statements as to his capacity, and it could not be held responsible for not becoming aware of the situation sooner.61\n\nThe Rules relating to this application are those of January 2003.\n\nEgypt\u2019s application of 18 October 2007, p. 2.\n\nIbid., p. 3.\n\nIbid., pp. 3-4.\n\n129.\n\nEgypt submitted that international law deferred to domestic law on questions of capacity. This was because the ICSID Convention and the BIT were both silent as to capacity, which was the issue at hand. Nor were there any established rules of international law governing capacity generally or capacity to conclude arbitration agreements in particular. Where international law contains no clear rule reference is made to national law.62 Egypt cited the International Court of Justice in *Barcelona Traction63* in support of its proposition. Egyptian national law was applicable as it governed the bankruptcy proceedings in issue.64\n\nIbid., p. 6.\n\n*Case concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Limited,* ICJ Reports (1970), p. 3.\n\nEgypt\u2019s application of 18 October 2007, pp. 7-10.\n\n130.\n\nEgypt requested the Tribunal to declare either that Mr Siag lacked capacity to accept Egypt\u2019s offer under the BIT to arbitrate disputes under the Convention, and accordingly that there was no consent under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, and to dismiss Mr Siag\u2019s claims on grounds of lack of jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention; or that Mr Slag lacked standing to initiate or maintain his claims and to dismiss those claims for lack of standing. Mr Siag should pay the full costs of the application.65\n\nIbid., p. 14.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Answer\n-----------------\n\n131.\n\nFollowing a one-week extension due to the death of Ms Vecchi, the Claimants filed their Answer to Egypt\u2019s bankruptcy application on 8 November 2007, together with a further expert opinion by Professor Reisman dated 7 November 2007 and a second witness statement from Dr Abou Zeid Fahmy, dated 6 November 2007.\n\n132.\n\nIn addition to arguments previously made, the Claimants submitted that ICSID Rule 41(1) required any objection to jurisdiction to be made \"as early as possible.\" In order for its claim to be heard Egypt would have to demonstrate that it could not reasonably have learned of the bankruptcy issue in time to raise it during the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings. Egypt could not do so: it had actual knowledge of the bankruptcy proceedings well before the jurisdiction phase of the arbitration, and had accordingly failed to satisfy ICSID Rule 41(1).66\n\nClaimants\u2019Answer of 8 November 2007, pp. 1 -2, 19-20.\n\n133.\n\nClaimants further submitted that the re-opening of the bankruptcy proceedings had not resulted in the re-bankruptcy of Mr Siag. The proceedings remained \"pending\" and had not resulted in a judgment declaring Mr Siag bankrupt.67\n\nIbid., pp. 3-4.\n\n134.\n\nIn respect of standing, Claimants argued that domestic Egyptian law could not possibly dictate Mr Siag\u2019s standing before an ICSID Tribunal, which was governed exclusively by international law, namely Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, and the Italy - Egypt BIT.68 At most Egyptian law could curtail Mr Siag\u2019s ability to litigate before Egyptian courts.69 If any state\u2019s domestic laws were relevant to Mr Siag\u2019s standing (which Claimants denied) it was the laws of Italy. Egypt had taken no steps to have the bankruptcy litigation recognised by Italy.70 Further, the re-opening of the bankruptcy proceedings violated many fundamental requirements of Egyptian law. Therefore even under Egyptian law, which was not relevant, Egypt\u2019s application must fail.71\n\nIbid., pp. 24-29.\n\nIbid., p. 3.\n\nIbid., pp. 4, 29-30.\n\nIbid., pp. 4, 30-37.\n\n135.\n\nClaimants submitted that the ILC Articles set out a general principle of international law, which was not limited to the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts.72 At international law Egypt\u2019s courts are the Egyptian state and accordingly the 1999 and 2003 bankruptcy proceedings must be regarded as having been conducted by Egypt.73\n\nIbid., p. 13.\n\nIbid., p. 14.\n\n136.\n\nClaimants also argued that Egypt\u2019s application ought to be deemed to have been waived. ICSID Rule 26(3) provided that any step taken by a party after the expiration of an applicable time limit \"shall be disregarded\" by the Tribunal in the absence of special circumstances. Egypt\u2019s bankruptcy application was filed six months after the decision on jurisdiction and fourteen months after the deadline for the submission of memorials on jurisdiction. Egypt had adduced no special circumstances to rebut the *prima facie* rule that the application ought to be disregarded by the Tribunal.74 ICSID Rule 27 stated that a failure to raise objections promptly meant that those objections must be deemed to have been waived. Egypt was aware of the bankruptcy proceedings involving Mr Siag prior to the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration yet failed to raise its concerns until after a decision on jurisdiction had been rendered. Egypt should therefore be held to have waived its objections pursuant to ICSID Rule 27.75 Claimants cited examples of previous ICSID Tribunals deciding that objections raised late in the day should be deemed to have been waived.76\n\nIbid., pp. 20-21.\n\nIbid., pp. 21 -24.\n\n*Generation Ukraine Inc v Ukraine,* ICSID Case ARB/00/9, Award of 16 September 2003; *Azurix Corp v The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case ARB/01/12.\n\n137.\n\nIn respect of costs, Claimants submitted that the Tribunal should award the Claimants the full measure of costs in relation to Egypt\u2019s application, and in so doing should consider the manner in which the application had been made.77\n\nClaimants\u2019 Answer of 8 November 2007, p. 39.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Reply\n-------------\n\n138.\n\nEgypt filed its Reply to Claimants\u2019 Answer on 29 November 2007, supported by the second opinion of Professor Hans Smit dated 23 November 2007 and a large number of exhibits. In addition to those arguments already made Egypt submitted that, under ICSID Rule 41(1), a party may object to jurisdiction on the basis of a fact previously unknown to it. Egypt had no knowledge of the re-opening of the bankruptcy proceedings at the time that jurisdiction was first under consideration, and brought the matter to the Tribunal\u2019s attention as soon as Egypt became aware of it.78\n\nEgypt\u2019s Reply of 29 November 2007, p. 3.\n\n139.\n\nEgypt accepted that under international law it was responsible for the wrongful acts of its judiciary. However, that was not the same thing as saying that the State had knowledge of every order or decision made by its courts.79\n\nIbid., pp. 3-4.\n\n140.\n\nIn response to Claimant\u2019s waiver argument Egypt submitted that it could not waive its objection to jurisdiction based on Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy because only those for whose benefit the underlying right or limitation was conferred may waive the right to object. In this case the beneficiaries were Mr Siag\u2019s creditors, and only they (acting collectively) could waive the right to object to Mr Siag\u2019s capacity to deal with the bankrupt estate.80\n\nIbid., p. 4.\n\n141.\n\nEgypt claimed that Mr Siag had entered an appearance in an appeal brought by AAIB and decided in 2006 finding him (along with members of his family) not liable to AAIB pursuant to a settlement agreement. One of the respondents to that appeal was Mr Mohamed Ismail Mohamed, the trustee of Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy estate, acting in that capacity. That was irrefutable proof that Mr Siag was bankrupt until at least 26 April 2006.81 Further, Mr Siag was at all material times aware of his bankruptcy and withheld that information from Egypt and from the Tribunal. That constituted bad faith on the part of Mr Siag, who was accordingly estopped from pleading waiver on the part of Egypt.82\n\nIbid., p. 5.\n\nIbid.\n\n142.\n\nShould the Tribunal find that Egypt had waived its right to object to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, Egypt submitted that the Tribunal ought to review its jurisdiction of its own initiative, as it was empowered to do by ICSID Rule 41(2).83 The Tribunal should follow this course of action as part of its duty to render an enforceable award.84 A failure by the Tribunal to recognise Mr Siag\u2019s lack of capacity would amount to a manifest excess of power capable of sanction under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.85 Claimants had received the opportunity to present their case on the bankruptcy issue and would therefore suffer no prejudice were the Tribunal to exercise its discretion and review its jurisdiction *sue sponte86*\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., p. 6.\n\nIbid.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Reply of 29 November 2007.\n\n143.\n\nEgypt submitted that it was untenable to argue as Claimants did that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention was the sole determinant of a party\u2019s ability to be engaged in an ICSID arbitration. If that were the case a minor or insane person could initiate ICSID proceedings, which could not have been the intention of the Convention.87\n\nIbid., p. 8.\n\n144.\n\nEgypt further submitted that its domestic courts did not act improperly in either the 1999 or 2003 bankruptcy proceedings.88 However, the Tribunal could not in any case review bankruptcy decisions made by domestic Egyptian courts. Such issues were non-arbitrable.89\n\nIbid., pp. 9-15.\n\nIbid., pp. 8-9.\n\n145.\n\nIn Egypt\u2019s submission, the 1999 bankruptcy was \"closed\" but it did not \"end\". Under the old Commercial Code of Egyptian law a bankrupt could only be discharged upon the conclusion of a settlement agreement with his creditors or upon the \"unification of creditors,\" i.e., the sale and distribution of the bankrupt\u2019s assets. Neither of those events had occurred in this case.90 Nor had there been the third method of discharge, introduced by the new Commercial Code, of satisfaction of all creditors.91 The reopening of the bankruptcy proceedings in 2003 re-instated Mr Siag\u2019s status as a bankrupt. Closed proceedings did not end, and re-opened proceedings were not new proceedings, they merely resumed the formerly closed proceedings.92 The Tribunal should not give credence to the contrary statements of Dr Fahmy, who was Mr Siag\u2019s own lawyer.93 For the avoidance of doubt, Egypt made clear that some of the grounds of its objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction were the 2003 re-opening of bankruptcy proceedings, rather than the original proceedings of 1999.94\n\nIbid., p. 13.\n\nIbid., p. 14.\n\nIbid., pp. 15-16.\n\nIbid., p. 16.\n\nIbid.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder\n--------------------\n\n146.\n\nClaimants submitted their Rejoinder to Egypt\u2019s Reply on bankruptcy on 17 December 2007. Claimants maintained their previous arguments and further submitted that Egypt had completely failed to respond to Claimants\u2019 submission that \"Egypt\u2019s counsel in this case, the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority made the very same bankruptcy argument (unsuccessfully) In domestic litigation involving the Taba property in 1999.\"95 Claimants contended that the only conclusion that could be drawn from that fact was that Egypt\u2019s Egyptian counsel, which had \"actively participated in the jurisdictional phase of this case\"96 had deliberately elected to withhold the bankruptcy objection during the jurisdiction phase of the arbitration.97 As regards Egypt\u2019s knowledge of the bankruptcy proceedings, it was not a question of the Tribunal having to impute such knowledge to Egypt because under international law the actions of the Egyptian judiciary were the actions of the Egyptian state. Therefore, Egypt\u2019s knowledge was actual knowledge.98\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder of 17 December 2007, p. 1.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., p. 4.\n\n147.\n\nClaimants argued that Egypt had confused this ICSID arbitration and the ICSID Rules with Egyptian law and a domestic Egyptian proceeding. Under the ICSID Rules, Egypt certainly could waive its jurisdictional objections; it was not the case that the only ones who could do so were Mr Siag\u2019s creditors in bankruptcy.99\n\nIbid., pp. 4-5.\n\n148.\n\nIn addition Claimants submitted that there had been no bad faith on Mr Siag\u2019s part. He was not a bankrupt when he brought this arbitration and thus had nothing to disclose. Further, Mr Siag could not have misled Egypt about a matter of which Egypt had full knowledge.100\n\nIbid., p. 5.\n\n149.\n\nEgypt\u2019s suggestions that failure by the Tribunal to consider Egypt\u2019s application might constitute grounds for an annulment of the Award eventually rendered were baseless.101\n\nIbid., p. 6.\n\n150.\n\nContrary to Egypt\u2019s assertion, Claimants would suffer great prejudice if the Tribunal were to consider Egypt\u2019s out-of-time application. Such would add further delay to an already long-running battle by Claimants to have their case heard on the merits.102\n\nIbid., p. 7.\n\n151.\n\nClaimants submitted that Egypt had confused domestic and international law as regards a party\u2019s capacity. What Egypt referred to was capacity to enter a contract, to which domestic law was indeed applicable. This case, however, concerned Mr Siag\u2019s standing to conduct an international arbitration under applicable international rules, *i.e.,* those set out in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, and the Italy - Egypt BIT.103\n\nIbid., p. 9.\n\n152.\n\nWhatever may be true in a commercial arbitration, an ICSID Tribunal was certainly entitled to consider whether a bankruptcy adduced to support the dismissal of a party\u2019s claim was in fact in place.104 In the present case there was no bankruptcy. The rule set down by the Egyptian Commercial Code, Articles 550(2) and 594, was that bankruptcy only occurred upon judgment thereof.105 The mere re-opening of the 1999 proceedings did not render Mr Siag bankrupt.106\n\nIbid., p. 14.\n\nIbid., pp. 14-15.\n\nIbid., p. 15.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on the Merits (as to the Bankruptcy Issue)\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nClaimants filed their Reply on the Merits on 21 December 2007. Included with that Reply was the fourth opinion of Professor Reisman dated 18 December 2007, and the third witness statement of Dr Fahmy dated 18 December 2007, both of which dealt *inter alia* with Egypt\u2019s application in respect of the claimed bankruptcy.\n\n154.\n\nIn addition to previously made submissions, Professor Reisman and Dr Fahmy stated that Egypt had grossly misrepresented the nature of the decision of the Cairo Court of Appeal closing the bankruptcy proceedings on 24 June 1999. That decision reinstated Mr Siag to full capacity following settlement of the US$7,000 debt, and prevented a re-opening of the proceedings.107 Reference to the bankruptcy receiver in the decision of the Cairo Court of Appeal of 22 April 2006 did not prove that Mr Siag was bankrupt. The receiver was joined to the case by the AAIB in 1999, but did not take part in the procedure. Indeed the receiver was referred to in 2002, which was a time when Egypt agreed Mr Siag was not bankrupt. Further, the 2006 decision confirmed that Mr Siag was a defendant in his personal capacity and that he had not been substituted by the bankruptcy receiver.108\n\nExpert Opinion of Dr Abou Zeid Fahmy of 18 December 2007, p. 1.\n\nIbid., p. 2.\n\n155.\n\nIn respect of waiver, Claimants submitted that Egypt\u2019s assertion that its objections to jurisdiction could not be waived relied on the assumption that Mr Siag\u2019s alleged bankruptcy would deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction. That was not the case: as the Tribunal held in its Decision on Jurisdiction, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention contained a complete procedure for the determination of jurisdictional issues. An ICSID Tribunal would retain jurisdiction over a party notwithstanding his bankruptcy under the host state\u2019s municipal law.109 Egypt\u2019s assertions amounted to a claim that its municipal law could unilaterally divest the Tribunal of jurisdiction by declaring that Mr Siag was bankrupt, and that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to inquire into the truth of that allegation.110\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 18 December 2007, p. 38.\n\nIbid.\n\n156.\n\nLastly, Claimants submitted that whether the Tribunal\u2019s potential award may in the future be subject to municipal bankruptcy proceedings was not the Tribunal\u2019s concern.111\n\nIbid., p. 39.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits (as to the Bankruptcy Issue)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nEgypt briefly touched on its bankruptcy application in its Rejoinder on the Merits dated 12 February 2008. Therein Egypt noted that the bankruptcy proceedings involving Mr Siag were ongoing in the Egyptian courts. Egypt also stated that a bank (unnamed) had \"put Mr Siag into bankruptcy\" and a trustee was now in control of Mr Siag\u2019s assets.112 Egypt included with its Rejoinder a 3rd opinion by Professor Smit, dated 11 February 2008, which also referred to the bankruptcy issue.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, pp. 11 - 12.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6\n----------------------\n\n158.\n\nOn 15 February 2008 the Tribunal issued its sixth Procedural Order, which dealt with procedural matters in relation to both of Egypt\u2019s applications. In respect of Egypt\u2019s application based on Mr Siag\u2019s alleged bankruptcy, the Tribunal stated as follows:\n\n\"5.2 The Tribunal does not consider that a case for suspension of the merits phase has been made out on the materials submitted to date in respect of Applications 1 [bankruptcy] and 2, and to the extent that the Applications call for immediate suspension they are not granted.\n\n5.3 The Tribunal does not however consider that it is in a position to make a final determination on Applications 1 and 2 without hearing oral argument and receiving further evidence. The Tribunal notes that, understandably, there has been no affidavit or witness statement filed by Mr Siag to date as part of the merits phase of the arbitration on Applications 1 and 2 and considers that he should have the opportunity to adduce further evidence. [...]\n\n5.5 The Tribunal is of the view that oral argument on the Respondent\u2019s three applications should be heard at the start of the period set down for the merits hearing in March. The Tribunal will then decide whether to proceed with the merits hearing or to suspend the proceeding. The parties must come to the hearing on the basis that they must proceed to present their cases on the merits if ordered to do so.\n\n**DIRECTIONS**\n\n**Directions as to the hearing of Applications 1.2 and 3 on March 10, 2008**\n\n6.1 Taking into account its views set out in Section 5 above that a case for suspension has yet to be made out in respect of applications 1 and 2 and noting that the Claimants have not yet had an opportunity to respond to Application 3, the Tribunal directs that applications 1, 2 and 3 be set down for hearing at 10 am on Monday 10 March 2008 in Paris.\n\n6.2 Either party may file supplementary witness statements, affidavits, or documents in relation to applications 1, 2 and 3. If either party elects to do so the following timetable will be followed:\n\n(i) Any further documents witness statements or affidavits from Respondent to be lodged and served no later than 25 February 2008;\n\n(ii) Any further documents, witness statements or affidavits (whether additional or supplemental or by way of reply to those filed under (a)) to be lodged and served by the Claimants on or before 29 February 2008.\n\n6.3 Without derogating from the generality of the directions in 6.1 above, and without intending to convey in any way any preliminary views one way or the other on applications 1 and 2, the Tribunal considers that it may be assisted in its deliberations by the production of further documentary evidence, if such is available, from each party in respect of applications 1 and 2, namely:\n\n(i) from the Respondent, a certificate or similar notification from an Egyptian court that states that Mr Siag has been declared bankrupt; [...]\n\n(ii) from the Claimants, [...] (b) evidence in relation to the claim made in its Rejoinder and referred to in paragraph 4.15 (i) above [the claim that Egypt\u2019s counsel had previously raised the bankruptcy proceedings in domestic litigation in Egypt]\n\nIf a party is unable to obtain such documents they are requested to so advise the Tribunal in writing before the commencement of the hearing on March 10, 2008 and indicate why it was unable to obtain the requested documents. Nothing in this direction is to be regarded as preventing a party from proving or establishing such matters by means of other documentary or oral evidence.\"\n\nEgypt\u2019s Further Submissions\n---------------------------\n\n159.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s directions in Procedural Order No.6, Egypt filed on 25 February 2008 a witness statement of that date from Mr Asser Harb, a State Attorney at the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority.113 Mr Harb exhibited to his statement a certificate from the Giza Court of First Instance dated 19 February 2008 which Egypt submitted showed that Mr Siag \"continues to be in bankruptcy\" and that the next hearing concerning the implementation of the bankruptcy procedures would be on 8 March 2008.114 Egypt submitted that there was little question as to whether Mr Siag was in fact in bankruptcy.\n\nMr Harb had also attended the jurisdictional hearing in August 2006.\n\nEgypt\u2019s letter of 25 February 2008, p. 3.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Further Submissions\n------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nClaimants filed their further submissions on 29 February 2008, together with the fourth witness statement of Mr Siag, dated 29 February 2008 and a witness statement also dated 29 February 2008 from Mr Samir Abillama. Those submissions dealt primarily with what was by that stage known as \"application number 2\" - based on Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality - but also touched on \"application number 1\", the bankruptcy application. Claimants submitted that not only did ESLA raise Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings during domestic litigation concerning the Taba project, but ESLA also ran at that time the same lack of capacity argument it was now running on the basis of those bankruptcy proceedings. Indeed, Mr Harb had now conceded that fact.115 Claimants further submitted that, contrary to Egypt\u2019s claims, Mr Siag had not been declared bankrupt. Egypt\u2019s contention that the mere re-opening of bankruptcy proceedings rendered Mr Siag \"re-bankrupt\" were implausible and contrary to the Egyptian Commercial Code. The certificate provided by Egypt on 25 February 2008 fell far short of declaring that Mr Siag was in fact bankrupt.116\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 29 February 2008, pp. 61 - 64.\n\nIbid., pp. 64-65.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Further Submissions on the Eve of the Hearing and Claimants\u2019 Motion to Strike\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nOn 4 March 2008, in breach of the timetable set out in Procedural order No. 6, Egypt purported to file further submissions on its applications, principally applications 2 and 3 (application 3 relating to Ms Vecchi\u2019s heirs) but also in relation to application 1. Egypt also purported to file a second witness statement from Mr Nadim Souhaid, dated 3 March 2008. On 5 March 2008 Claimants applied to have these submissions struck out as being out of time. On 6 March 2008 the Tribunal directed Egypt to formally apply for leave if it wished to have the submissions admitted to the record and advised that any such application would be determined at the hearing on 10 March 2008. By email of 9 March 2008 Egypt advised that it had decided not to seek leave on this point. The Tribunal therefore did not pursue the matter further and the Chairman informed the parties of Egypt\u2019s decision in that respect on the first day of the hearing.117\n\nT1:4.\n\nThe Hearing on 10 March 2008 Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 6\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe hearing of Egypt\u2019s applications took place in Paris on 10 March 2008. Mr Reginald Smith, Mr Ken Fleuriet, Mr Craig Miles, Ms Heloise Herv\u00e9, and Ms McGinnis, all of the law firm King & Spalding, attended for the Claimants. Attending the hearing for Egypt were Mr Lawrence Newman, Ms Gamila Kassem, Mr Mahmoud Sabry Youssef, Mr Joseph Schopf, Mr Scott Hutchins, and Ms Caroline Derache, all from the law firm Baker & McKenzie, together with Professor Dr Ahmed Kamal Aboulmagd and Mr Hazem Rizkana of the law firm Helmy, Hamza & Partners, Dr Karim Hafez and Ms Amani Khalifa of Hafez Law Firm, Mr Milad Sidhom Boutros, Mr Asser Harb, Mr Hussein Mustafa, Mr Wahid Awad of the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, Mr Ahemed Hassan from the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism, Mr Nadim Souhaid and Mr Hafiz Ghalayini from Lebanon, and Mr Mohamed Abdel Aal of the legal department at the Tourism Development Authority. Mr Smith, Mr Miles and Mr Fleuriet addressed the Tribunal and examined witnesses on behalf of the Claimants. Dr Aboulmagd, Mr Newman and Mr Hafez did the same on behalf of Egypt. Mr Siag, Professor Reisman (by video-link) and Mr Abillama gave oral testimony for the Claimants, and were cross-examined on Egypt\u2019s jurisdictional objections.118\n\nMr Siag and Professor Reisman later gave evidence on the merits.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Oral Submissions as to Bankruptcy (on 10 March 2008)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nEgypt made its oral submissions first. In relation to the bankruptcy application those began with the submission that, although Egypt could be held responsible for the acts of its judiciary, that was a different thing to attributing to Egypt the knowledge of every decision rendered by its courts. Such a contention was unsupported by authority and stretched the legal fiction of state unity.119 Egypt contended that Mr Harb\u2019s evidence had confirmed that ESLA had no knowledge of the re-opening of the bankruptcy proceedings at the time of the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration.120 Egypt had no reason to assume at an earlier stage that Mr Siag was bankrupt. He had put himself forward as a *bona fide* claimant and Egypt took him at his word.121 Egypt accused Mr Siag of fraudulently concealing from Egypt and the Tribunal the re-opening of his bankruptcy and submitted that he could not now claim that Egypt had waived its objections based on that re-opening: equity demanded that he who came to equity came with clean hands.122\n\nT1: 60-61.\n\nT1:61 -62.\n\nT1:62-63.\n\nT1:66.\n\n164.\n\nEgypt submitted that the re-opening of the bankruptcy proceedings had re-instated Mr Siag as a bankrupt. If that were not the case there would be no difference between re-opening proceedings and issuing fresh proceedings.123 The decision of the Cairo Court of Appeal against \"the trustee of the bankruptcy estate of Siag Pyramids Hotel and its two partners, Waguih Elie Siag and Rami Elie Siag\" on 26 April 2006 demonstrated conclusively that Mr Siag was still bankrupt in 2006.124 It was not open to the Tribunal to review the actions of the Egyptian courts in reopening the bankruptcy proceedings. Mr Siag must at the least be held to have waived his right to have that decision reconsidered in an international forum.125 If Mr Siag were bankrupt, he did not have the capacity to initiate or maintain this arbitration. Article 5 of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (\"the New York Convention\") stated that municipal courts could refuse to recognise and enforce an award where the party resisting enforcement showed that a party or parties were \"under the law applicable to them under some incapacity.\" That demonstrated that international law deferred to national law on matters of capacity.126 Egyptian law, as the *lex concursus,* should determine Mr Siag\u2019s capacity. However, even under Italian law, which the Claimants had submitted was the relevant law, a bankrupt does not have the capacity to agree, initiate or maintain an arbitration.127\n\nT1:67-68.\n\nT1:68-69.\n\nT1:70-71.\n\nT1:71 -73.\n\nT1:73-74.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Oral Submissions as to Bankruptcy (on 10 March 2008)\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 began by noting that the re-suspension of the merits phase following a decision on jurisdiction, as Egypt had requested, had only happened once in 135 concluded ICSID cases,128 in which the facts were exceptional. ICSID Rule 41 dictated that only if Egypt\u2019s objections were not known or reasonably knowable at the time of the jurisdiction phase could they be raised at a later stage.129 In this case Egypt had been aware of the bankruptcy proceedings since the commencement of the arbitration, both because the Egyptian judiciary were considered at international law to be an organ of the Egyptian state and because ESLA, Egypt\u2019s counsel in this arbitration, had raised the same objections during earlier domestic litigation.130 Either ICSID Rule 26 or 27 could be applied to Egypt\u2019s objection should the Tribunal determine that the requirements of ICSID Rule 41 (as to timing of jurisdictional objections) had not been satisfied.131 The Tribunal ought to consider whether Egypt\u2019s response on the issue of timeliness was credible.132\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, a.s v The Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case ARB/97/4.\n\nT1: 77-78.\n\nT1:79, 90.\n\nT1:81.\n\nT1: 84.\n\n166.\n\nClaimants further submitted that Mr Siag had no reason to mention the re-opened bankruptcy proceedings, because they had not resulted in his bankruptcy and were not relevant in any case. Mr Siag was accordingly not estopped from pleading waiver on Egypt\u2019s part.133 Mr Siag was not bankrupt on the date of consent in May 2005 and he was not bankrupt today.134 Although Egypt referred to him being in a \"bankrupt status\" Egypt had never said that there had been a judgment or a ruling in the reopened proceedings that declared Mr Siag bankrupt.135\n\nT1: 85.\n\nT1: 88, 91.\n\nT1: 92.\n\n167.\n\nMr Siag\u2019s capacity to commence this arbitration was a matter governed exclusively by international law, namely the ICSID Convention and the BIT, as the Tribunal had held in its Decision on Jurisdiction.136 Egypt\u2019s municipal laws on capacity were irrelevant.137 If any domestic law were relevant it would be the law of Italy for it was as a national of Italy that Mr Siag had commenced his claim.138 This was not an international commercial arbitration, and the New York Convention was not relevant to the mechanisms set out in the ICSID Convention.139 In addition, and although the Tribunal should not get to this point, even under Egyptian law Mr Siag had the requisite capacity to initiate and maintain these proceedings.140\n\nT1: 88-89.\n\nT1: 95-96.\n\nT1: 97.\n\nT1: 95.\n\nT1: 97-99.\n\nProcedural Order No. 7\n----------------------\n\n168.\n\nAt the start of the Hearing, on 11 March 2008,141 the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 7, which dealt with Egypt\u2019s applications as discussed at the previous day\u2019s hearing. In respect of application number 1, the bankruptcy application, the Tribunal directed as follows:\n\n\"6. The Tribunal considers that the decisions on the Applications should be resolved as part of the Award on the merits. Although the Tribunal has already received extensive written submissions and yesterday heard oral submissions and the examination of witnesses, the issues are not straightforward. The Tribunal wishes to reflect on the submissions and evidence and take more time for deliberations.\n\n7. Accordingly the decisions on the Further Objections to Jurisdiction involved in Applications 1 and 2 will be given at the same time as the decision on the merits. In short, although the Tribunal has received extensive observations in this regard in the form of written and oral submissions and evidence, the Tribunal has resolved to join the Further Objections to Jurisdiction to the merits. Participation by the respondent in the merits hearing will not of course constitute a waiver of any kind of their Further Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n8. There is no need for the parties to submit any further evidence or written arguments on Applications No.1 and No.2 and no party shall do so without leave being granted by the Tribunal. Leave may be appropriate in respect of developments concerning bankruptcy and any responses from the Lebanese government concerning nationality.\"\n\nT2: 1.\n\nProcedural Order No. 8\n----------------------\n\n169.\n\nOn 18 March 2008 the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 8. In relation to the bankruptcy application that Order stated:\n\n\"5. [...] Now that the hearing has concluded, no further evidence relating to bankruptcy...may be submitted whether by leave or otherwise.\"\n\nEgypt\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions (as to Bankruptcy)\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe parties each submitted post-hearing submissions on all issues, including Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy, on 24 April 2008. Egypt\u2019s submissions on the issue of bankruptcy were that Mr Siag was currently bankrupt. The Claimants had not seriously challenged this fact.142\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, p. 18 - 19.\n\n171.\n\nIn addition, Egypt contended that Article 4 of the ILC Articles applied only to the responsibility of a state for the acts of its organs. It did not attribute to the state the knowledge of every decision rendered by its courts.143 Egypt had no knowledge of the re-opening of the bankruptcy proceedings until it raised its concerns with the Tribunal.144\n\nIbid., p. 19.\n\nIbid.\n\n172.\n\nEgypt further submitted that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention was silent on questions of capacity. Mr Siag\u2019s capacity to sue must therefore be determined by the law applicable to him, *i.e.,* Egyptian law.145\n\nIbid., p. 20.\n\n173.\n\nLastly, Egypt submitted that it could not waive its objections grounded in Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy because the rights of others would be affected.146\n\nIbid.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Submissions (as to Bankruptcy)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions were principally to repeat that ICSID Rule 41 required jurisdictional objections to be made as early as possible. Untimely objections could only be made if they were unknown, and not reasonably knowable, during the time limits set by the Tribunal for jurisdictional objections. Egypt\u2019s bankruptcy application was predicated on facts fully known or reasonably knowable to Egypt during the jurisdictional phase, and was impermissible under Rule 41.147 ICSID Rules 26 and 27 set forth the sanction for a party\u2019s failure to raise its objections to jurisdiction as early as possible. Both were applicable to Egypt in this case.148\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions p. 1.3.\n\nIbid., pp. 1 -2.\n\n**Discussion of Egypt\u2019s Bankruptcy Application**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nDid (and Could) Egypt Contravene ICSID Rule 41?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe proper starting point in assessing Egypt\u2019s bankruptcy application is in the Tribunal\u2019s view the Claimants\u2019 submission that Egypt brought its application too late and that it should accordingly be disregarded by the Tribunal pursuant to ICSID Rule 26 and/or held waived pursuant to ICSID Rule 27.\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 case on this point flows from ICSID Rule 41(1). If Egypt is held not to have satisfied Rule 41, submitted the Claimants, then the sanctions provided by Rules 26 and 27 can be applied. ICSID Rule 41(1) reads as follows:\n\n\"Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder - unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.\" (Underlining added.)\n\n177.\n\nProfessor Reisman for Claimants submitted the following on ICSID Rule 41: the phrase \"shall be made as early as possible\" is mandatory, not precatory. The phrase was not entirely clear and its precise meaning and application must therefore be sought in general international law, including principles of treaty interpretation, customary international law, and general principles of law.149 Professor Reisman cited Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"the Vienna Convention\"), to which he noted Egypt and Italy were party.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 7 November 2007, pp. 8-9.\n\n178.\n\nApplying Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, ICSID Rule 41 should be construed in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its words, and also in accordance with its context, which included related instruments. Of those related instruments the ICSID Convention was most illustrative of the meaning of the phrase \"shall be made as early as possible.\" Article 51 of the ICSID Convention provided in relevant part that either party may request the revision of an Award on the ground of discovery of a fact that was, at the time of the award, \"unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant and that the applicant\u2019s ignorance of the fact was not due to negligence.\"150\n\nIbid., pp. 10-11.\n\n179.\n\nWhile Article 51 did not apply to this case, Professor Reisman submitted that it was nevertheless useful in clarifying the meaning of Rule 41(1), which similarly contemplated a situation wherein facts were previously unknown to the party raising them.151 Reading Rule 41(1) in light of Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, the effect of the phrase \"shall be made as soon as possible\" was that an objection to jurisdiction must be made: (1) within the time limits set by the Tribunal; unless (2) the objection relies on a factual predicate genuinely unknown to the objecting party; and (3) provided that the ignorance of the party raising the objection could not be attributed to negligence, wilful blindness or illicit tactical considerations.152\n\nIbid., p. 11.\n\nIbid., p. 17.\n\n180.\n\nEgypt did not challenge Claimants\u2019 submissions as to the meaning of Article 41(1) or the phrase \"shall be made as soon as possible.\" Professor Smit for Egypt noted that it was a \"commonly accepted notion\" that a defendant should not delay the interposition of a preliminary objection lest the objection be deemed to have been waived.153 Egypt denied that it had breached Rule 41(1). However, it did not do so on grounds that the Rule intended something other than was submitted by Claimants.154 The Tribunal accepts the interpretation of Rule 41(1) offered by Professor Reisman. Rule 41(1)\u2019s application to the facts of the case will now be examined.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Smit of 23 November 2007, p. 8.\n\nEgypt Instead denied that It had knowledge of the facts predicating Its bankruptcy objection at an earlier stage, and denied that It had the ability to waive Its objections. See, *e.g.,* Egypt\u2019s Reply dated 29 November 2007 and the Expert Opinion of Prof Smit of 23 November 2007.\n\n181.\n\nEgypt submitted that only Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy creditors, acting collectively, could waive the objection to Mr Siag\u2019s capacity based on his bankruptcy. Professor Smit stated as follows:\n\n20. \"...a rule of this kind applies only if the defense is in law waivable. For example, defenses that raise lack of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived, for the parties cannot by implicit or explicit agreement bestow upon a tribunal competence that the law withholds from it.\n\n21. The bankruptcy defense appears to be of that nature. Bankruptcy protects all creditors against the bankrupt\u2019s disposing of any of the bankrupt estate\u2019s assets. This basic protection would be subverted if any of the debtors (like, in this case, Egypt) could waive application of the rule that bankruptcy protects all creditors by enabling the bankrupt to recover personally assets that belong to the bankrupt estate. It cannot reasonably be assumed that a procedural rule, like Rule 41, would enable a bankrupt so to avoid the reach of his bankruptcy.\"155\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Smit of 23 November 2007, p. 9.\n\n182.\n\nEgypt further submitted that any money that may be awarded to Mr Siag must be placed in the bankrupt estate and therefore that it may be determined by the Egyptian courts that Mr Siag has no right to proceed on behalf of his creditors.156\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, p. 12.\n\n183.\n\nClaimants stated in response that Egypt had confused domestic proceedings with international proceedings under the ICSID Rules, and that the issue for the Tribunal was simply whether the ICSID Rules permitted the Tribunal to make a finding of waiver in this case.157\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder of 17 December 2007, pp. 4-5.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 submissions on this point. It considers that the question as to whether or not Egypt may waive its objections is dictated by the ICSID Rules governing this arbitration. No authority was cited by Egypt to the contrary. Turning to the application of the ICSID Rules, the Tribunal notes that previous ICSID Tribunals, for example those relied upon by the Claimants: *Generation Ukraine Inc v Ukraine158* and *Azurix Corp v The Argentine Republic159* have dismissed objections brought outside applicable deadlines.\n\nICSID Case ARB/00/9, Award of 16 September 2003.\n\nICSID Case ARB/01/12, Decision of 25 February 2005 (Claimants\u2019 Exhibit 154).\n\n185.\n\nIn the early stages of the *Azurix* arbitration, on 29 November 2004, the Respondent challenged the appointment of the President of the Arbitral Tribunal. The President, Dr Andres Rigo Sureda, sent his two co-arbitrators a letter of explanation as to the situation which had given rise to the challenge. The Tribunal, via the ICSID Secretariat, thereafter invited the parties to submit their comments on that letter no later than 30 December 2004. New facts were brought to the attention of the Tribunal on 28 January 2008 and, in a letter of 1 February 2008, the Respondent contended that those new facts strengthened its challenge. The Tribunal found that the Respondent knew or should have known of the grounds on which it based its challenge as early as 30 March 2004. It therefore ruled, In light of Rule 27 of the ICSID Rules, that \"by any reasonable standard, it cannot be said in the present case that the party putting forward its Proposal [for Disqualification] has acted promptly.\" The Tribunal concluded by stating \"that Argentina is deemed to have waived its right to request the disqualification of Dr Rigo, on the ground that it has not reacted with the promptness required by Rules 9 [Disqualification of Arbitrators] and 27 [Waiver] of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, after having been made aware of the facts upon which it bases its Proposal for disqualification\"160\n\nIbid., pp. 7-8.\n\n186.\n\nIn the *Generation Ukraine v Ukraine* case, the Respondent had raised a jurisdictional objection in the course of the final hearing, alleging a deficiency in the formal appointment of the Claimant\u2019s counsel. This objection, based on a document filed with the Notice of Claim, was dismissed by the Tribunal which recalled the express terms of Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Rules and found that the objection had been raised late.161\n\nSee p. 48 of the Award.\n\n187.\n\nMoreover, Professor Schreuer, in his authoritative text \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary\", expresses the view that Rule 41(1) contains a time limit. He further states that if facts which could give rise to a jurisdictional objection are discovered after the expiration of the time limit fixed in Rule 41(1), any such objection must be \"raised immediately when the relevant facts come to light.\"162 It follows from Professor Schreuer\u2019s analysis that submissions filed after expiration of either the time limit contained in Rule 41(1) or time limits set by the Tribunal pursuant to Rule 26(1) and which are not raised immediately upon discovery of the relevant facts, would not be considered as having been filed \"as early as possible\" and may thus be both disregarded, under Rule 26(3), and considered to be waived, under Rule 27.\n\nChristoph H Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2001), at p. 553.\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find anything in Egypt\u2019s submissions to warrant a departure from the approach to Rules 26, 27 and 41 as manifested in the *Azurix* and *Generation Ukraine* cases and confirmed by the analysis of Professor Schreuer. In particular the Tribunal rejects Egypt\u2019s submission that it was not able to waive its objections to jurisdiction because such could only be done by Mr Siag\u2019s alleged bankruptcy creditors. ICSID Rule 41(1) confers upon \"a party\" the right to object to jurisdiction. Egypt has utilised that right. There was no suggestion by Egypt that the right to object to jurisdiction could, let alone, could only, be utilised by Mr Siag\u2019s purported bankruptcy creditors. The Tribunal considers that it would be unusual if a party were permitted to utilise a right but prevented from waiving that right. If that were the case the right in question would become an immutable obligation. Egypt has not claimed that it was obliged to bring its bankruptcy objections and, of course, that is not the case under ICSID Rule 41. A natural extension to this proposition is that a party may be held to have waived a right granted to it, if it fails to properly address that right, as Claimants submit is the case here.\n\n189.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly considers that Egypt was able to waive its objections to jurisdiction based on Mr Siag\u2019s claimed bankruptcy. The next question for the Tribunal is of course whether Egypt did in fact waive its objections.\n\n190.\n\nEgypt first raised its bankruptcy objection on 6 September 2007, although the Tribunal notes that at that stage Egypt\u2019s application was specifically based on the 1999 bankruptcy proceedings rather than the 2003 re-opening. Egypt first referred to the 2003 re-opening on 13 September 2007. The last date allowed by the Tribunal for submissions on jurisdiction by Egypt was 24 July 2006. Egypt\u2019s application was made more than 13 months after that date, and was made more than 5 months after the Tribunal had issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, dated 11 April 2007.\n\n191.\n\nEgypt has not denied that its objections were not made within the time limits established by the Tribunal for the filing of arguments on jurisdiction. Egypt asserts, however, that the basis of its objection, namely the re-opening of Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy in 2003, was not known to Egypt at that time, and further, was not reasonably knowable.\n\n192.\n\nClaimants\u2019 primary ground for resisting Egypt\u2019s assertion is that under international law the acts of Egypt\u2019s courts are regarded as the acts of the Egyptian state. Egypt\u2019s courts made the rulings closing and re-opening Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy and Egypt cannot deny knowledge of its own acts.\n\n193.\n\nArticle 4 of the ILC Articles states as follows:\n\n\"The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central government or of a territorial unit of the State.\"\n\n194.\n\nEgypt submitted that Article 4 holds a State responsible only for the acts of its organs; it does not expect a State to have knowledge of every act carried out by those organs.163 In other words, Egypt claimed that, while it could be held responsible for the wrongful acts of its judiciary, it could not be expected to be aware of all the non-wrongful acts of its organs.164 The Claimants asserted that Article 4 was a general principle of international law, which was not limited to the wrongful acts of a state organ.165\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, p. 19.\n\nT1: 61.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Expert Opinon of Prof Reisman of 7 November 2007, pp. 19, 22.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal prefers the arguments of the Claimants on this issue. In taking that view, the Tribunal notes the provisions of Article 7 of the ILC Articles, which states that: \"The conduct of an organ of a State...shall be considered an act of the State under international law...even *if it exceeds its authority\u2019* [emphasis added], Dolzer and Schreuer state that under Article 4 of the ILC Articles, \"[a]cts of a state\u2019s organs will be attributed to that state *even if they are contrary to law*...\"166 [emphasis added]. The clear corollary of that statement is that acts of a State\u2019s organs that are not contrary to law or in excess of authority will be applied a *fortiori* to the State. Accordingly the non-wrongful acts of Egypt\u2019s judiciary are the acts of the Egyptian State. As Claimants have submitted, Egypt cannot deny knowledge of its own acts.\n\nRudolf Dolzer and Christoph Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment* Law (2008), p. 196 (citing Article 7 of the ILC Articles).\n\n196.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes the Award of the Tribunal in *Robert Azinian v Mexico,*167 in which it was stated:\n\n\"Although independent of the Government, the judiciary is not independent of the State: the judgment given by a judicial authority emanates from an organ of the State in just the same way as a law promulgated by the legislature or a decision taken by the executive.\"168\n\nThe Tribunal also draws support from the Decision on Jurisdiction in *Saipem v Bangladesh* which stated that \"...the courts are \u2018part of the State\u2019 and, thus, their actions are attributable to Bangladesh.\"169\n\n*Azinian, Davitian, & Baca v. Mexico,* ICSID Case ARB (AF)/97/2, Award of 1 November 1999, (Claimants\u2019 legal authority 151).\n\nIbid., para. 98.\n\n*Saipem SpA v The People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures (Claimants\u2019 legal authority 150), para. 143.\n\n197.\n\nProfessor Reisman stated that Article 4 of the ILC Articles was not based on an attribution of wrongful conduct but rather a general principle of international law.170 Egypt offered no authority in contradiction. Professor Smit simply stated that the extension of a state\u2019s liability to its knowledge would \"appear extremely unfair and inappropriate.\"171 The Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 arguments on this point.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 7 November 2007, p. 19.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Smit of 23 November 2007, p. 10.\n\n198.\n\nClaimants further submitted that Egypt\u2019s knowledge was demonstrated by the fact that ESLA ran the same lack of capacity argument in domestic Egyptian litigation prior to the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration. On Egypt\u2019s behalf Mr Harb, while accepting that ESLA was aware of the 1999 proceedings,172 categorically denied that it was aware of the 2003 re-opening.173 Mr Harb stated that ESLA handled around two million cases per year and could not maintain a regular database of those cases. Accordingly, it was not reasonable to suggest that ESLA ought to have been aware of the 2003 re-opening.\n\nWitness statement of Mr Asser Harb, p. 4.\n\nIbid., p. 5.\n\n199.\n\nThe Tribunal prefers and accepts the Claimants\u2019 arguments concerning ESLA. The Tribunal considers that Egypt has over-stated the difficulty inherent ascertaining the fact of the 2003 re-opening. The Claimants informed the Tribunal and Egypt on 11 September 2007 that the 1999 bankruptcy proceedings had in fact been closed. On 13 September 2007 Egypt replied that the proceedings had been re-opened in 2003. Plainly it did not take Egypt long to ascertain that the proceedings had been reopened once informed that they had previously been closed.\n\n200.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s consideration there are further insuperable difficulties for Egypt in asserting that it did not have, or could not reasonably have had, knowledge of the 2003 re-opening. As noted above, Egypt\u2019s initial application for suspension dated 6 September 2007 was predicated on the 1999 proceedings declaring Mr Siag bankrupt. At the time of its original application Egypt stated the following: \"We have recently learned that Mr Siag had a bankruptcy order entered against him by the Cairo Court of Appeal on 16 January 1999.\"174 A copy of the 16 January 1999 decision was annexed to Egypt\u2019s application. Egypt subsequently informed the Tribunal that its application was based on the 2003 re-opening. However, it is clear that Egypt\u2019s original application was based on the January 1999 proceedings.\n\nEgypt\u2019s application of 6 September 2007, p. 2.\n\n201.\n\nMr Harb accepted that ESLA had appeared and argued at Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy hearing before the Court of Administrative Judiciary in Cairo in 1999. He also stated that his department at ESLA became aware of the 1999 proceedings when asked to handle the matter of Mr Slag and Ms Vecchi in or about March 2005.175 The Tribunal considers that ESLA\u2019s knowledge of the 1999 proceedings was apparent from 1999. However, even if the Tribunal were to take the March 2005 date proffered by Mr Harb as determinative, the fact remains that both dates were well before the jurisdictional phase of this case, submissions on which did not commence until June 2006. The question then is this: as Egypt had knowledge of the 1999 proceedings from at least March 2005 why did it not raise its jurisdictional objection, based on those proceedings, during the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration? If it had done so it would no doubt have received notice from Claimants that the 1999 proceedings had been closed, which would have led Egypt to ascertain that the proceedings had then been re-opened. Given the short space of time within which that exchange occurred once Egypt had made its application in September 2007, the Tribunal has no doubt that Egypt would have become aware of the re-opening comfortably within the time limits allowed by the Tribunal for filing submissions in the jurisdiction phase. Egypt\u2019s failure to raise its objections at that time, in light of its accepted knowledge of the 1999 proceedings, can only be seen as a negligent omission.\n\nWitness statement of Mr Asser Harb, p. 4.\n\n202.\n\nEgypt also submitted that it did not have a central bankruptcy register and accordingly could not reasonably be expected to have learned of the re-opening at an earlier stage. The Tribunal is not persuaded by this submission. As stated above, it took Egypt two days at most from learning that the bankruptcy proceedings had been closed to discovering their re-opening.\n\n203.\n\nFor the reasons set out above the Tribunal considers that Egypt had both actual and constructive knowledge of the 2003 re-opening of the bankruptcy proceedings involving Mr Siag. Egypt was bound by ICSID Rule 41(1) to raise its objection based on these proceedings as early as possible but did not do so. The Tribunal accordingly finds that Egypt has contravened ICSID Rule 41(1).\n\nWhat Sanctions Are Appropriate for Egypt\u2019s Breach of Rule 41(1)?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nClaimants have submitted that relief is available under both ICSID Rule 26 and ICSID Rule 27, and that either would be appropriate.176 The Tribunal accepts that submission. In terms of Rule 26, Egypt took a step, in this case filing its objection to jurisdiction on the grounds of bankruptcy, after the expiration of the time limits set by the Tribunal for the filing of submissions on jurisdiction. Egypt did not expressly state that its lack of knowledge constituted a \"special circumstance\" such as to offset Rule 26. However, even on the assumption that that submission was intended, it is rejected for the reasons set out above. In terms of Rule 27, Egypt knew or should have known that, in its submission, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention had not been complied with. It should be noted that - as part of its objection to jurisdiction based on Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality - Egypt made the claim that a breach of Article 25 did not come within the purview of ICSID Rule 27 because the ICSID Convention was not one of the sets of rules or regulation to which Rule 27 applied.177 Although that claim was not made in respect of the bankruptcy-related objection, the Tribunal considers that Egypt\u2019s assertion applies equally to the bankruptcy application, and will address it in that respect. The Tribunal does not uphold the submission that Rule 27 does not apply to an objection flowing from a breach of Article 25. In the Tribunal\u2019s view the ICSID Convention clearly constitutes a set of \"other rules...applicable to the proceeding\" for the purposes of Rule 27. The Tribunal accepts the submissions of Professor Reisman that the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rules are to be read together as part of an ensemble of instruments governing the conduct of ICSID arbitrations.178 Egypt failed to \"state promptly\" its objections to jurisdiction, as is required by Rule 27.\n\nT1:81. Rule 26(3) states that \"any step taken after expiration of the applicable time limit shall be disregarded unless the Tribunal, in special circumstances and after giving the other party an opportunity of stating its views, decides otherwise.\" Rule 27 states that \"a party which knows or should have known that a provision of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, of these Rules, of any other rules or agreement applicable to the proceeding, or of an order of the Tribunal has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed - subject to Article 45 of the Convention - to have waived its right to object.\"\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions (on the Lebanese nationality objection) of 31 January 2008, p. 4.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 7 November 2007, pp. 8, 10.\n\n205.\n\nA final matter for determination in respect of ICSID Rule 27 is Egypt\u2019s claim that Mr Siag is estopped from pleading waiver because he acted in bad faith by not revealing his bankrupt status at an earlier stage.179 As will be discussed in detail below, the Tribunal finds that Egypt has not demonstrated that Mr Siag was in fact bankrupt at times material to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. If Mr Siag were not bankrupt at times material to this arbitration he, of course, had nothing to divulge. However, even if Mr Siag were bankrupt at material times, the Tribunal accepts Mr Siag\u2019s testimony that he was not aware of that fact. On day one of the hearing in Pahs (10 March 2008), Mr Siag stated that, since the closing of the bankruptcy proceedings in 1999: \"I have never heard in any court of law the Government of Egypt saying that I don\u2019t have a stance, never.\"180 The Tribunal accepts this evidence as truthful. Both Claimants181 and Egypt182 referred to the requirement and/or presence of bad faith in relation to estoppel. The Tribunal does not consider there was any bad faith on the part of Mr Siag in this respect. Accordingly Egypt\u2019s claim of estoppel is dismissed.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Reply of 29 November 2007, p. 5.\n\nT1: 219-220.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 18 December 2007, p. 31 (and citations).\n\nEgypt\u2019s Reply of 29 November 2007, p. 5 (stating that Mr Slag had acted In bad faith, had \"misled everyone\" and had committed a \"wrong\") and Prof Smlt\u2019s Expert Opinion of 23 November 2007, pp. 10-11, which employs terms such as \"fraud\" and \"deceit.\"\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that both ICSID Rules 26 and 27 apply, and determines that: (1) Egypt\u2019s jurisdictional bankruptcy objection was out of time and thus shall be disregarded, pursuant to ICSID Rule 26, and (2) that Egypt has waived by its conduct its objections based on Mr Siag\u2019s alleged bankruptcy, pursuant to ICSID Rule 27.\n\n207.\n\nNevertheless, in the interests of completeness the Tribunal will examine and decide Egypt\u2019s bankruptcy objection as if it had been presented timeously and there had been no waiver. This course of action is appropriate for another reason, namely that, following Procedural Order No. 7 of 11 March 2008, Egypt pursued this argument at the merits phase of the arbitration, albeit as a subsidiary defence.183\n\nSee Egypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, at pp. 3-4, 18-20.\n\n**The Merits of Egypt\u2019s Bankruptcy Application**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIs (or Was) Mr Siag Bankrupt?\n-----------------------------\n\n208.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the appropriate starting point for an assessment of the merits of Egypt\u2019s application is an examination of whether Mr Siag is or was in fact bankrupt. Egypt claimed categorically that Mr Siag was bankrupt after the bankruptcy proceedings were re-opened in 2003, that he was bankrupt in 2006 and that he is bankrupt today.184 Claimants contended that Mr Siag was not bankrupt on the date he consented to ICSID arbitration (26 May 2005) and nor has he since been adjudged bankrupt.185\n\nIbid., p. 19.\n\nT1: 88.\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Egypt has not demonstrated that Mr Siag was bankrupt at times relevant to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the ICSID Convention. The detailed reasons for that decision follow.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal anticipated that the resolution of this question would be unproblematic -if Mr Siag had been \"re-bankrupted\" in 2003 it could be expected that there would be a judgment or order of an Egyptian court declaring him bankrupt. It was for that reason the Tribunal sought from Egypt, in Procedural Order No. 6 dated 15 February 2008, \"a certificate or similar notification from an Egyptian court that states that Mr Siag has been declared bankrupt.\"186\n\nPara. 6.2(i).\n\n211.\n\nThe Certificate from the Giza Court of First Instance dated 19 February 2008, which was annexed to Mr Harb\u2019s witness statement of 25 February 2008, stated that Mr Siag was bankrupted on 16 January 1999 and that \"post-bankruptcy procedures are to be conducted on 8 March 2008.\" Mr Harb stated that this document \"confirmed] the fact that Mr Siag is in fact in bankruptcy.\"187 The Tribunal does not consider the certificate to be conclusive of Mr Siag\u2019s alleged bankruptcy. The Claimants did not deny that Mr Siag was declared bankrupt in January 1999.188 Instead, the Claimants emphasised that the bankruptcy had been closed following payment of the debt. However, Egypt made clear that its application was based on the 2003 re-opening of the bankruptcy proceedings.189 The dispute between the parties is whether the reopened proceedings \"re-instated\" Mr Siag to a status of bankruptcy in 2003, not whether Mr Siag was originally bankrupted in 1999. The Tribunal therefore expected a certificate or similar stating that Mr Siag had been effectively \u2018re-bankrupted\u2019 at the time of the re-opening in 2003. Such has not been provided.\n\nWitness statement of Mr Asser Harb, p. 6.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Claimants\u2019 Answer of 8 November 2007, p. 5.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Reply of 29 November 2007, p. 16.\n\n212.\n\nEgypt cited in its application a 2003 decision of its Court of Cassation, which stated *inter alia* that it was established that a bankruptcy judgment in Egypt removed the capacity of the bankrupt to litigate.190 That does not appear to have been the case with Mr Siag. Mr Siag stated at the hearing that he had initiated domestic court proceedings in Egypt in his personal capacity without any indication that he lacked capacity.191 The following exchange between Mr Smith and Mr Siag is indicative:\n\n\"Q: Have you had occasion in your personal capacity as Waguih Siag to bring actions in the Egyptian courts since 1999?\n\nA: Yes, several cases...\n\nQ: And did anyone claim in connection with any of those personal proceedings that you lacked capacity as a bankrupt to pursue claims on your own behalf?\n\nA: The only time I heard that I did not have standing, it was in 1996 in the administrative court. Never, ever have I heard anybody in Egypt saying that I don\u2019t have a standing in any place relating to the bankruptcy.\"192\n\nEgypt\u2019s application of 18 October 2007, Exhibit 2.\n\nT1: 217, 222-223.\n\nT1: 222-223.\n\n213.\n\nEgypt also cited Articles 216 of the old Egyptian Commercial Code and 592 of the new Code to the effect that a bankrupt is \"divested of his right to manage and dispose of assets owned by him on the date he is declared bankrupt.\"193 The Tribunal would accordingly expect Mr Siag, were he in fact bankrupt, to have lost control of his assets. That does not appear to be the case. The following exchange between Professor Pryles and Mr Siag in respect of the 22 April 2006 judgment of the Cairo Court of Appeal took place at the hearing on 10 March 2008:\n\nQ: This judgment says that Mr Mohamed Ismail Mohamed is the bankruptcy receiver, Siag Pyramids Tourism Company. Does he also have control over your personal assets?\n\nA: No, your Honour, he doesn\u2019t have control on anything. I have never seen him in my life...\n\nQ: So are you able to deal with your own property by yourself?\n\nA: Of course, I manage my day-to-day operation.194\n\nEgypt\u2019s Reply of 29 November 2007, p. 7.\n\nT1: 217.\n\n214.\n\nMr Siag impressed the Tribunal as an honest and credible witness. The Tribunal accepts the evidence of Mr Siag on this point. The Tribunal also accepts the evidence of Dr Fahmy who stated that reference to the bankruptcy receiver in the decision of the Cairo Court of Appeal of 22 April 2006 did not prove that Mr Siag was bankrupt, and that the 2006 decision confirmed that Mr Siag was a defendant in his personal capacity and had not been substituted by the bankruptcy receiver.\n\n215.\n\nFor the reasons set out above the Tribunal finds affirmatively on the evidence that Mr Siag is not now bankrupt and also was not bankrupt at those times set out by Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as being relevant to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, namely the time Mr Siag consented to this arbitration and the date on which the arbitration was registered.\n\n216.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal finds on the facts that (1) Mr Siag was declared bankrupt in January 1999; (2) that on 24 June 1999, by the closing of bankruptcy proceedings following the payment of the debt, Mr Siag was discharged from bankruptcy; (3) that bankruptcy proceedings were re-opened in 2003; (4) that Mr Siag has not again been declared bankrupt; (5) that Mr Siag was not bankrupt on the relevant dates for the purposes of jurisdiction in this case, *i.e.* 26 May 2005 when the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration and thus accepted the offer of consent contained in the BIT, and 5 August 2005 when the Request was registered.\n\n217.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s findings it is not necessary to address Egypt\u2019s argument that if Mr Siag was bankrupt he had no standing under Egyptian law to conclude an arbitration agreement.\n\n218.\n\nIt follows that the Tribunal does not accede, on the basis of the bankruptcy application, to Egypt\u2019s request that the Decision on Jurisdiction be \"withdrawn\" and it finds that Egypt\u2019s bankruptcy defence fails on the merits and is dismissed.\n\n**V. EGYPT\u2019S OCTOBER 2007 OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION BASED ON MR SIAG\u2019S LEBANESE NATIONALITY**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The Parties\u2019 Submissions on Egypt\u2019s \"Lebanese Nationality\" Application**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEgypt\u2019s Application\n-------------------\n\n219.\n\nOn 9 October 2007, almost six months after the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, Egypt wrote to the Tribunal in respect of facts from which it claimed \"the inescapable inference must be drawn that Mr Siag has deceived the Tribunal with respect to him having been a Lebanese national.\" Egypt contended that the Ministry of Interior of the Lebanese Republic had certified to Egypt that Mr Siag was not, and had never been, a Lebanese national.195 Egypt annexed to its application a letter from Ms Nada Ramez Al Kasty of the Lebanese Ministry of Interior to Mr Abdul Hafiz El Ghalayini dated 3 October 2007, which stated that \"...we advise you that upon reviewing the Personal Affairs Records of El Saray District, Sayda, No. 37, we did not find any registration for Mr Wagih Elie Siag.\"196\n\nEgypt\u2019s application 9 October 2007, p. 1.\n\nIbid., Exhibit (1).\n\n220.\n\nEgypt contended that it could reasonably be inferred from that letter that Mr Siag had presented a forged nationality certificate to the Lebanese embassy in Cairo as part of his application that Egypt recognise his Lebanese nationality.197 Egypt noted that the Tribunal had found in its Decision on Jurisdiction that, pursuant to Article 10(3) of the Egyptian nationality law, Mr Siag had been required to state his intention to retain his Egyptian nationality within one year of gaining permission from Egypt to obtain Lebanese nationality. As Mr Siag did not state such an intention within the relevant time, the Tribunal held that he had lost his Egyptian nationality.198\n\nIbid., pp. 1 and 2.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, p. 49.\n\n221.\n\nBased on the new information it had presented, namely the letter from Ms Al Kasty, Egypt argued that, as Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality was never properly acquired, he had no valid basis on which to ask Egypt to recognise that nationality, and he was under no obligation to indicate an intention to retain his Egyptian nationality. Therefore, Mr Siag remained an Egyptian national and accordingly failed the negative nationality requirement of Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal was therefore without jurisdiction.199 Egypt contended that Mr Siag\u2019s fraud was directly responsible for Egypt\u2019s lack of knowledge on this matter and its resultant inability to raise the matter at an earlier stage in the proceedings. Egypt became aware of Mr Siag\u2019s status only after making enquiries of the Lebanese Ministry of Interior in an attempt to learn the date of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese naturalisation.200 Egypt requested that the Tribunal suspend the proceedings on the merits pending the outcome of its application, and establish a schedule for receiving submissions thereon.201\n\nEgypt\u2019s application 9 October 2007, p. 1.\n\nIbid., p. 2.\n\nIbid.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits (as to the Lebanese Nationality Issue)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nEgypt filed its Counter-Memorial on the merits on 12 October 2007. In addition to addressing matters relevant to the merits portion of the arbitration, Egypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial, together with the expert opinion of Professor Smit dated 11 October 2007 which accompanied it, also addressed Egypt\u2019s Lebanese nationality objection. Egypt submitted that Professor Smit\u2019s opinion made it clear that Mr Siag had never properly shed his Egyptian nationality when he \"supposedly took on Lebanese nationality.\"202 Egypt argued that the only explanation for the issuance of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese citizenship document was that Mr Siag was Lebanese at birth, and that the only evidence supporting the conclusion that Mr Siag was Lebanese through naturalisation was false and likely fabricated.203 Being Lebanese by birth, Mr Siag had never had the opportunity to shed his Egyptian nationality by operation of Egyptian law because the provisions of Egyptian law permitted a person to do so only on the occasion of him or her acquiring a new nationality.204 Egypt argued that the Tribunal should carefully reconsider its decision that the Claimants lost their Egyptian nationality. Egypt suggested the Tribunal could do so because a final Award had not been issued on the matter and contended that failure to listen to further presentations regarding the Claimants\u2019 Egyptian nationality would afford Egypt an opportunity to challenge the Award \"through a nullification application based on unfairness or other inadequacy in the way the proceedings were conducted in this important and fundamental respect.\"205\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, p. 49.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., p. 48.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Answer (in Respect of Bankruptcy)\n--------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nAs noted above, on 8 November 2007 the Claimants submitted their Answer to Egypt\u2019s application on the grounds of Mr Siag\u2019s bankruptcy. An opinion from Professor Reisman was submitted in support of Claimants\u2019 position. Although dealing primarily with the bankruptcy application, Professor Reisman also touched briefly on Egypt\u2019s \"Lebanese nationality\" application. Professor Reisman did not speak to the merits of the Lebanese nationality application but stated that the application must be deemed to have been waived.206\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 7 November 2007, p. 29, n 49.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response\n-------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimants responded in greater detail to Egypt\u2019s application on 16 November 2007. The Claimants submitted that no Lebanese official had stated that Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record was illegitimate or that his Lebanese nationality was invalid.207 The only fact attested to by the Lebanese Ministry of Interior was that it was unable to locate a registration record for Mr Siag in the district of Sayda.208 The inferences drawn by Egypt from this submission were unwarranted.209 The most likely explanation for the failure to locate a registration record for Mr Siag was that the record had been lost, misplaced, discarded or moved at some point over the past 18 years. That was entirely plausible given the turmoil experienced in Lebanon over that period.210\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions 16 November 2007, pp. 1 -2.\n\nIbid., p. 2.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n225.\n\nClaimants further argued that Egypt\u2019s contention that there had been forgery on the part of Mr Siag was highly implausible, and was contradicted by contemporaneous evidence. Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record bore the seals and marks of the Lebanese government and the signature of Lebanon\u2019s then counsel to Egypt, Mr Nicola Khawaja. In addition, Mr Siag had received a \"to whom it may concern letter\" from the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo in 1989, and had been issued with a Lebanese passport on 14 June 1990. For Egypt\u2019s premise to be correct Mr Siag would either had to have forged these official Lebanese government documents, duped the Lebanese government officials or somehow acted wrongfully in concert with them. There was nothing to suggest that Mr Siag was involved in any such conduct.211\n\nIbid., pp. 2-3.\n\n226.\n\nClaimants argued that, in any event and as foreshadowed by Professor Reisman\u2019s opinion of 7 November 2007, Egypt\u2019s right to file such an objection must be regarded as having been waived. The objection was made six months after the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, and 18 months after the deadline imposed by the Tribunal for submissions on Jurisdiction. Accordingly, as was the case with Egypt\u2019s objection in respect of Mr Siag\u2019s alleged bankruptcy, the Lebanese nationality objection was not brought \"as early as possible\" as was required by ICSID Rule 41, and was waived pursuant to ICSID Rules 26 and 27.212 The Claimants noted that the parties had argued at some length over Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record in their respective memorials on jurisdiction. During that time Egypt had made contact with the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo in respect of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality. Egypt accordingly could and should have raised its present objection during the jurisdictional phase of this case.213\n\nIbid., pp. 3-4.\n\nIbid., pp. 4-5.\n\n227.\n\nFor all those reasons Claimants requested that the Tribunal reject Egypt\u2019s request for a stay and rule that Egypt had waived its application. Claimants asked that the Tribunal consider Egypt\u2019s many unfounded jurisdictional objections when making its order as to costs at the end of the proceeding.214\n\nIbid., p. 5.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Further Submissions Following Egypt\u2019s \"Further Enquiries\"\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nOn 21 December 2007, over a month after Claimants had filed their Response, Egypt informed the Tribunal that it had made yet further enquiries in Lebanon, which had resulted in the discovery of additional evidence which proved that Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality documents were false. Egypt noted that the new evidence would soon be provided to the Tribunal.\n\n229.\n\nYet another month elapsed before Egypt filed further submissions, dated 31 January 2008, containing the new evidence it had alluded to on 21 December 2007. Egypt also filed at that time a witness statement from Abdul Hafiz Ghalayini, a partner at Houri & Ghalayini, a law firm in Beirut dated 31 January 2008. Mr Ghalayini had been instructed by the Egyptian Embassy in Beirut to obtain information in respect of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality and Individual Record.\n\n230.\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions of 31 January 2008 were that it had obtained three further important pieces of evidence that proved that Mr Siag\u2019s claim to Lebanese nationality was false: a letter from the Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigrants dated 26 November 2007 stating that no record of Mr Siag had been found in any register in Sayda; a certificate from the General Directorate for Personal Affairs of the Lebanese Ministry of Interior and Municipalities dated 8 December 2007 stating that Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record had been \"taken from a bogus document\"; and a document received on 29 January 2007 from the General Directorate for Public Security of the Lebanese Ministry of Interior and Municipalities attesting that Mr Siag\u2019s two Lebanese passports were not genuine.215\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions of 31 January 2008, pp. 1 - 2.\n\n231.\n\nEgypt claimed that this new evidence demonstrated that the documents Mr Siag had proffered in support of his Lebanese nationality were fraudulent and probably also forged,216 and that it was more than sufficient to prove that Mr Siag had made false claims as to his Lebanese nationality.217 Egypt noted that Mr Siag had claimed that he lost his Egyptian nationality as a result of obtaining Lebanese nationality and failing to apply within one year to retain Egyptian nationality. If Mr Siag had not in fact obtained Lebanese nationality, he was under no obligation to declare an intention to retain Egyptian nationality. If Mr Siag had therefore not lost his Egyptian nationality, and remained Egyptian, Egypt submitted that he failed the negative nationality requirement of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and was barred from bringing a claim by the applicable ICSID Rules.218 Egypt argued that the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (that an investor not be a national of the host state) were tantamount to subject-matter jurisdiction, and could not be waived.219\n\nIbid., p. 3.\n\nIbid., p. 2.\n\nIbid., pp. 3, 5.\n\nIbid., pp. 3-4.\n\n232.\n\nEgypt submitted that even if the requirements of Article 25 could be waived, they had not been waived in this case. Mr Siag had withheld information concerning his fraudulent representation as to his Lebanese nationality. The applicable standard was whether Egypt \"should have known\" about Mr Siag\u2019s fraud. It was \"hard to fathom\" how Egypt should have known.220 The Egyptian government could not be said in any sense to have access to the files or records of the Lebanese government, upon whom Mr Siag\u2019s fraud was initially perpetrated.221 Egypt only became aware of the possibility that the identity register document evidencing Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality may have been fraudulent after the Decision on Jurisdiction in these proceedings, at which time Egypt\u2019s legal team222 looked closely at the document.223 Mr Siag had failed to come forward with documentation proving that he had been naturalised as Lebanese, which he could have been expected to do had such documentation existed.224\n\nIbid., p. 4.\n\nIbid.\n\nAs noted earlier, Egypt had added further Baker & McKenzie lawyers to Its legal team after the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions of 31 January 2008, p. 4.\n\nIbid.\n\n233.\n\nIn addition Egypt contended that ICSID Rule 27 applied only to breaches of the ICSID Rules, the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, other rules or agreements applicable to the proceeding, or an order of the Tribunal. It did not apply to a breach of the ICSID Convention itself.225\n\nIbid.\n\n234.\n\nEgypt lastly submitted that, if the Tribunal ignored Egypt\u2019s clear evidence, there was little question that the Award rendered would be seen by an *ad hoc* committee as a contravention of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.226\n\nIbid., p. 5.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits (as to the Lebanese Nationality Issue)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nEgypt filed Its Rejoinder on the Merits on 12 February 2008. The Rejoinder, and the third opinion of Professor Smit (dated 11 February 2008), that was filed in support thereof, both touch on Egypt\u2019s \"Lebanese nationality\" application. Many of Egypt\u2019s earlier submissions were re-iterated in Egypt\u2019s Rejoinder. In addition, Egypt submitted that it was apparent from the timing of Mr Siag\u2019s application for permission to acquire Lebanese nationality that he so applied in order to obtain dual Egyptian/Lebanese nationality and in so doing avoid compulsory Egyptian military service.227 Egypt said that Claimants could not argue that Egypt ought to have raised its objection at an earlier stage - the burden of proof rested on Mr Siag to show that he had been naturalised as Lebanese. Egypt had no knowledge that his claims were false. If anyone was to blame for the late raising of this application it was Mr Siag.228\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, p. 6.\n\nExpert Opinion of Professor Smit of 11 February 2008, pp. 11 - 12.\n\n236.\n\nEgypt submitted that, as Mr Siag had presented false evidence to the Tribunal, which formed the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, that Decision should be withdrawn in the face of the new evidence presented by Egypt, and an Award issued dismissing Mr Siag\u2019s claim as outside the jurisdiction of the BIT.229\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, p. 83.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6 (as to Application No. 2 - the Lebanese Nationality Issue)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal issued its sixth Procedural Order on 15 February 2008. In respect of what was termed \"application no. 2\" - Egypt\u2019s application based on Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality - the Order stated as follows:\n\n\"6.3 Without derogating from the generality of the directions in 6.1 above, and without intending to convey in any way any preliminary views one way or the other on applications 1 and 2, the Tribunal considers that it may be assisted in its deliberations by the production of further documentary evidence, if such is available, from each party in respect of applications 1 and 2, namely:\n\n(ii) from the Claimants, (a) certification from the Lebanese Ministry of the Interior that Mr Siag is a Lebanese national, and the date and place of his registration;\n\nIf a party is unable to obtain such documents they are requested to so advise the Tribunal in writing before the commencement of the hearing on March 10, 2008 and indicate why it was unable to obtain the requested documents. Nothing in this direction is to be regarded as preventing a party from proving or establishing such matters by means of other documentary or oral evidence.\"\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder\n--------------------\n\n238.\n\nOn 19 February 2008 the Claimants submitted a Brief Rejoinder to Egypt\u2019s \"Lebanese Nationality\" Allegations. Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder argued that the \"new evidence\" submitted by Egypt on 31 January 2008 was a contrivance apparently the product of Egyptian diplomatic pressure on Lebanese officials.230 Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record and two passports dated from 1989, 1990 and 1992 and showed that Mr Siag had travelled into and out of Lebanon on his Lebanese passports many times.231 The validity of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese documents had not previously been questioned, either by Lebanon or by Egypt, and it was curious that these documents were now being queried five weeks before the hearing on the merits.232 Mr Siag emphatically denied any wrongdoing in connection with his acquisition of Lebanese nationality, and specifically denied that he had been involved in fraud or forgery.233\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder of 19 February 2008, pp. 1 -2.\n\nIbid., p. 3.\n\nIbid., pp. 1 -2.\n\nIbid., p. 2.\n\n239.\n\nClaimants submitted that Egypt had in the past raised many jurisdictional objections based on supposed \"new evidence\" that could and should have been raised during the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. Given Egypt\u2019s behaviour the Tribunal ought to view Egypt\u2019s latest evidence, which responded too clearly to the concerns raised by Claimants on 16 November 2007, with an extraordinary degree of scepticism.234\n\nIbid., pp. 2-3.\n\n240.\n\nClaimants noted that they would attempt to provide to the Tribunal further evidence of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality, as requested by Procedural Order No. 6. However, given the short time Claimants had to achieve that task, and given Claimants\u2019 lack of diplomatic influence commensurate with that enjoyed by Egypt, Claimants were highly unlikely to be able to make the same showing as Egypt was able to with time and diplomatic channels on its side.235 The Tribunal might well be forced to decide between Claimants\u2019 contemporaneous evidence and Egypt\u2019s new evidence.236\n\nIbid., pp. 3-4.\n\nIbid., p. 4.\n\n241.\n\nClaimants argued that Egypt could and should have raised its objection during the jurisdictional phase. Each of Mr Siag\u2019s documents had been a matter of record since the outset of these proceedings. Indeed Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record and Nationality Certificate had been submitted by Egypt (as part of its Memorial on Jurisdiction of 12 June 2006) and were debated at length in the parties\u2019 respective submissions on jurisdiction.237 It was difficult to treat seriously Egypt\u2019s claim that it only recently examined the Individual Record closely.238 The fact that Egypt had itself presented Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record and Nationality Certificate meant that Egypt\u2019s claim that it did not have access to the files or records of the Lebanese government was also not borne out.239 Claimants submitted that Egypt had made direct enquiries of Lebanese government officials in both the jurisdictional phase and thereafter, and had received prompt responses on each occasion.240\n\nIbid., pp. 4-5.\n\nIbid., p. 5.\n\nIbid., pp. 4-5.\n\nIbid., p. 5.\n\n242.\n\nClaimants concluded that Egypt\u2019s application was a further attempt to avoid the merits phase of the arbitration and should be dismissed.241\n\nIbid., p. 6.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Further Submissions\n---------------------------\n\n243.\n\nAs noted above, Egypt presented further material on its applications on 25 February 2008. Egypt asserted that Mr Nadim Souhaid, a Lebanese lawyer, had been contacted by Baker & McKenzie in August 2007 and asked for assistance in obtaining evidence of Mr Siag\u2019s alleged Lebanese nationality. Mr Souhaid\u2019s brief was to ascertain whether Mr Siag was Lebanese by birth or by naturalisation. His enquiries led to the conclusion that Mr Siag did not possess Lebanese nationality at all. That in turn led to enquiries of the Lebanese courts which resulted in an official statement that there was no record of Mr Siag having Lebanese nationality.242 An additional effort had been made by Baker & McKenzie through a different law firm in Beirut, which resulted in the issuance of the statements annexed to the witness statement of Mr Ghalayini (noted above).243 Baker & McKenzie, and not ESLA, had undertaken the investigations into Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality. There was accordingly no substance to Claimants\u2019 suggestion that the documents received as a result of those investigations had been obtained as a result of diplomatic pressure.244\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions of 25 February 2008, pp. 1 - 2.\n\nIbid., p. 2.\n\nIbid.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Second Application to Bifurcate the Merits Phase\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nBy way of separate correspondence of 25 February 2008 Egypt applied again to bifurcate the upcoming merits hearing by concentrating in the first instance on matters other than damages. At the outset of its application Egypt stated that, on February 19 2008, \"the veil came off the Claimants\u2019 defense to Application No.2 and the reality emerged that Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality documents have indeed been falsified.\"245\n\nIbid., p. 1.\n\n245.\n\nEgypt further submitted that the Claimants had been invited by the Tribunal to present evidence of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality and had offered nothing.246 Why, Egypt asked, did Mr Siag not produce his own copy of his naturalisation certificate? Such would have been the obvious response to Egypt\u2019s application yet nothing had been forthcoming.247 Egypt stated that it had the difficult task of proving a negative in relation to Mr Siag\u2019s nationality. It should be much simpler for Mr Siag to positively establish his status.248\n\nIbid., p. 2.\n\nIbid., pp. 2, 4.\n\nIbid., p. 3.\n\n246.\n\nEgypt noted that it did not seek to have the proceedings on the merits suspended at this time. It recognised that there had to be a hearing on its applications. Instead Egypt sought an alteration to the merits phase, by not, at least initially, hearing argument on damages.249\n\nIbid., p. 5.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response to the Second Application for Bifurcation\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nClaimants responded to Egypt\u2019s request on February 27, 2008. In common with Egypt, Claimants made various submissions in respect of the \"Lebanese nationality\" issue. Claimants submitted that Egypt\u2019s claim that Mr Siag and his counsel had presented false evidence to the Tribunal was slanderous on its face, entirely without merit, and should be seen as a further attempt by Egypt to avoid the merits phase of the arbitration.250 Claimants noted that their further submissions on Egypt\u2019s applications, due on 29 February, would address Egypt\u2019s claims in more detail, and would include evidence from Mr Siag, who had not yet been heard on the matter.251\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 27 February 2008, p. 1.\n\nIbid., p. 2.\n\n248.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 submission, Mr Siag had provided extensive *prima facie* evidence of his Lebanese nationality and the burden of proof had therefore shifted to Egypt to prove its claims of forgery by clear and convincing evidence.252\n\nIbid.\n\n249.\n\nClaimants also contended that, in any event, Egypt\u2019s claims were ultimately irrelevant to Mr Siag\u2019s loss of Egyptian nationality under Egyptian law, which was the only relevant jurisdictional issue for the Tribunal.253\n\nIbid.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Further Submissions of 29 February 2008 as to Egypt\u2019s \"Bankruptcy\" and \"Lebanese Nationality\" Objections\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nAs noted above, on 29 February 2008 the Claimants presented their further submissions on both Egypt\u2019s \"bankruptcy\" and \"Lebanese nationality\" objections. As to the \"Lebanese nationality\" issue Claimants submitted that Egypt\u2019s application was an attempt to collaterally attack the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction and manufacture a basis for an eventual annulment application.254\n\nIbid., p. 1.\n\n251.\n\nClaimants argued that, as was the case with its \"bankruptcy\" objection, Egypt could and should have raised its \"Lebanese nationality\" objection during the scheduled jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. Mr Siag\u2019s acquisition of Lebanese nationality and the documents that underpinned that acquisition, were hotly debated between the parties in their submissions on jurisdiction and in the hearing on jurisdiction in August 2006.255 Pursuant to ICSID Rule 41 Egypt\u2019s application should have been made as early as possible. According to the Claimants, the sanction for Egypt\u2019s failure to adhere to Rule 41 was waiver under ICSID Rules 26 and 27.256 Egypt\u2019s claim that it only recently made a close examination of Mr Siag\u2019s documents was not an excuse.257 Egypt had devoted little time to the issue of waiver, and those arguments it had raised should be rejected. First, Egypt\u2019s contention that Mr Siag\u2019s nationality was an issue of subject-matter jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and therefore could not be waived assumed that the Tribunal was bound by United States law, which was not the case. Even if the Tribunal were to adopt United States law, jurisdiction over Mr Siag was a matter of personal, not subject-matter, jurisdiction.258 Secondly, ICSID Rule 27 clearly encompassed Article 25 of the ICSID Convention as a \"rule or agreement\" applicable to the proceeding. In addition, the ICSID Rules and ICSID Convention were to be considered together under the rules of interpretation set forth in the Vienna Convention.259 In any event, Egypt made no such attack on ICSID Rule 26, upon which Rule Claimants also relied.260\n\nIbid., pp. 2, 9.\n\nIbid., p. 6.\n\nIbid., p. 9.\n\nIbid., p. 6.\n\nIbid., p. 7.\n\nIbid., pp. 7-8.\n\n252.\n\nIf the Tribunal were to consider the merits of Egypt\u2019s Lebanese nationality objection, Claimants argued that Egypt should be held to a heightened burden of proof. Egypt bore the burden of proof to begin with, as it was their application under consideration.261 The usual \u2018preponderance of the evidence\u2019 standard of proof was not however appropriate given the following: first, Egypt had raised its latest objection to jurisdiction well after a Decision on Jurisdiction had been rendered;262 secondly, Egypt sought to challenge the plethora of *prima facie* evidence that Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality was properly obtained;263 finally, allegations of fraud and forgery as had been made by Egypt were typically held to a higher standard of proof.264 Although the terminology used differed, the United States formulation of \"clear and convincing evidence\" best described the standard typically applied.265 In Claimants\u2019 submission the evidence adduced by Egypt fell well short of the standard required. Egypt had submitted two conclusory, two-line letters about Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record and passports, which jumped to the conclusion that the documents were \"bogus\" or \"not genuine\" without further review or explanation. That evidence failed to satisfy even the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard, let alone the heightened standard that should be applied.266\n\nIbid., p. 10.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., pp. 10-11.\n\nIbid., p. 11.\n\nIbid., pp. 11, 15.\n\nIbid., p. 16.\n\n253.\n\nClaimants submitted that Egypt\u2019s protestations over Mr Siag\u2019s failure to provide a certificate of his naturalisation were misplaced: There was in fact such a certificate -Mr Siag\u2019s nationality certificate - which Egypt itself had submitted into evidence during the jurisdictional phase, and which Mr Siag had re-presented.267\n\nIbid., p. 17.\n\n254.\n\nIt was further submitted by Claimants that whether or not Mr Siag was Lebanese was irrelevant to the question of whether or not he lost Egyptian nationality under Article 10 of Egypt\u2019s nationality law.268 The Tribunal had accepted in its Decision on Jurisdiction that Article 10 was \"blind\" to the operation of Lebanese nationality law.269 Accordingly, any acts taken by an Egyptian national to acquire a foreign nationality prior to the Egyptian Interior Minister\u2019s grant of permission to do so were irrelevant as a matter of Egyptian law. The only act that mattered was the first formal expression of the acquired foreign nationality after the issuance of the Minister\u2019s authorisation.270 Further, Egyptian law did not require a robust investigation into the acquisition by one of its nationals of foreign nationality. A foreign passport was routinely accepted as proof thereof.271 In reality there was only one document of any significance to the application of Article 10 of Egypt\u2019s nationality law: Mr Siag\u2019s first Lebanese passport, which was the first \"formal expression\" by Lebanon of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality after the date on which Mr Siag received Egyptian authorisation to acquire Lebanese nationality. That act alone was sufficient for Mr Siag to lose his Egyptian nationality once he had failed to make the requisite declaration of intent under Article 10. Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record and his second Lebanese passport were therefore irrelevant.272\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., p. 18.\n\nIbid., p. 19.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., pp. 20-21.\n\n255.\n\nClaimants argued that Egypt\u2019s allegations of fraud and forgery on the part of Mr Siag were not plausible. There was absolutely no reason for Mr Siag to take the risks inherent in such activities when he could simply have become Italian and avoided Egyptian military service that way. The reason Mr Siag chose Lebanese nationality over Italian was his strong ancestral and personal connection to Lebanon. It was true that one of Mr Siag\u2019s motivating factors was a desire not to undergo military service. However, there was no reason for him to engage in fraud or forgery to achieve that end.273 Further, if his sole motivation in gaining Lebanese nationality was to avoid military service, and he was successfully exempted from such in 1990, Claimants asked why Mr Siag would have obtained a second Lebanese passport in 1992, then added his children to that passport in 1993, and renewed it in 1998, when the objective had been achieved.274\n\nIbid., pp. 21 -27.\n\nIbid., p. 60.\n\n256.\n\nClaimants noted that four documents contemporaneous with Mr Siag\u2019s acquisition of Lebanese nationality had been considered and relied upon by the parties: Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record, the nationality certificate issued by the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo, Mr Siag\u2019s 1990 Lebanese passport, and Mr Siag\u2019s 1992 Lebanese passport.275 Egypt had questioned the authenticity of each of these documents bar the nationality certificate.276 It was notable that Egypt had not queried validity of the nationality certificate, as that document represented a contemporaneous declaration by a senior Lebanese official that Mr Siag had properly acquired Lebanese nationality.277 Each of the four documents bore a mixture of official Lebanese seals, stamps, and signatures of Lebanese government officials, up to and including the Lebanese Ambassador. It would have been almost impossible for Mr Siag to fabricate or obtain these indicia by illegitimate means, were he even motivated to do so.278 In respect of Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record, Claimants noted that Mr Siag\u2019s copy contained a back page which was not submitted into evidence by Egypt. That page carried signatures that, although illegible, gave lie to Mr Souhaid\u2019s claim that one reason to doubt the Individual Record was that it \"contained no signatures.\"279 Further, the fact that Lebanese officials could not locate Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record 19 years after its creation offered little support to Egypt\u2019s application when the state of Lebanon\u2019s civil registry was taken into account. Lebanon\u2019s registry was plagued with difficulties, suffered from \"chronic structural, procedural and material deficiencies,\"280 wherein no central register was held and the size of the population had been uncertain for 50 years, as even the former Lebanese Minister of the Interior attested.281 In respect of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese passports Claimants noted that, in spite of Egypt\u2019s assertion that Baker and McKenzie ran the investigation in Lebanon, Mr Ghalayini\u2019s statement contained references to working with the Egyptian Embassy. That strongly suggested that Egypt\u2019s new evidence was the result of diplomatic pressure exerted by Egypt on certain Lebanese officials.282\n\nIbid., p. 27.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., pp. 27, 44.\n\nIbid., pp. 27 - 28 (generally), and pp. 28 - 60 (In detail).\n\nIbid., p. 32 (citing Witness Statement of Mr Nadim Souhaid, at para. 3(e)).\n\nIbid., p. 36 (citing the European Union Election Observation Mission, Parliamentary Elections, Lebanon 2005, Final Report, p. 45 (Claimants\u2019 Exhibit 131)).\n\nIbid., p. 39 (citing Rania Maktabi, \"The Lebanese census of 1932 revisited: Who are the Lebanese?\", British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies (1999), 219, p. 221, n 6 (Claimants\u2019 Exhibit 138)).\n\nIbid., p. 48.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Ruling on Egypt\u2019s Second Application for Bifurcation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its Ruling on Egypt\u2019s application to bifurcate the merits phase on 3 March 2008. As far as it is relevant to the \"Lebanese nationality\" application that Ruling read as follows:\n\n\"8.2 (iii) As stated at paragraphs 5.3 and 5.5 of Procedural Order No.6, the Tribunal wishes to hear further argument and evidence on Egypt\u2019s Application No.2 before making a final determination thereon. The Tribunal does not consider that it should order the bifurcation of the upcoming hearing on the implied assumption that Application No.2 is certain to be decided in favour of the Respondent.\"\n\nEgypt\u2019s Further Submissions on its Applications (in breach of Procedural Order No. 6)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nAs noted above, on 4 March 2008, shortly before the start of the hearing and in breach of Procedural Order No. 6, Egypt purported to file further submissions on each of its applications, followed on 5 March 2008 by a second witness statement from Mr Nadim Souhaid, dated 3 March 2008. Later on 5 March 2008 the Claimants filed a motion to strike out these two documents on the basis that they were unsolicited and introduced (in Mr Souhaid\u2019s statement) evidence previously not canvassed in these proceedings, namely evidence of Lebanese law. Egypt responded by email on 6 March 2008. On 6 March 2008 the Tribunal directed Egypt to formally apply for leave if it wished to have the submissions and witness statement admitted to the record. The Tribunal indicated that any such application would be determined at the hearing on 10 March 2008. By email of 9 March 2008 Egypt confirmed that it had decided not to seek leave to have the statement of Mr Souhaid and the submissions of 4 March 2008 added to the record. The Tribunal has therefore disregarded those materials.\n\nFurther Evidence and Submissions on Egypt\u2019s Further Jurisdictional Objections at the Hearing on 10 March 2008\n\n259.\n\nAs noted above, the hearing of both of Egypt\u2019s applications took place in Pahs on 10 March 2008.283\n\n*See* para. 162 above.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Oral Submissions on Lebanese Nationality284\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore the parties made their submissions on Egypt\u2019s Lebanese nationality objection, Claimants noted that counsel for Egypt had Indicated an Intention to adduce evidence of Lebanese nationality law - as appended to the second witness statement of Mr Nadim Souhaid - which had not been accepted Into evidence (T1: 5). Claimants opposed such a proposal as issues of Lebanese law had not previously been tabled and Claimants had had no time to prepare a case thereon (T1: 5-8). Claimants submitted that the only ground offered by Egypt in support of its Lebanese nationality application to that point had been that Mr Siag had fraudulently obtained evidence of his Lebanese nationality (T1: 5-7). The Tribunal directed that evidence as to Lebanese law not be submitted until the Tribunal had had time to consider the matter (T1: 34).\n\n260.\n\nEgypt\u2019s oral submissions on the Lebanese nationality objection were that the central fact in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis had to be the failure of Mr Siag to produce the documentary evidence requested by the Tribunal.285 Egypt contended that it was telling that Mr Siag had not produced a more recent Individual Record than the 1989 document already in evidence.286 Egypt submitted that Mr Siag obtained his Individual Record in order to avoid military service.287 From the Individual Record came the nationality certificate and the application for recognition by Egypt of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality.288\n\nT1: 31.\n\nT1: 34.\n\nT1: 35, 58.\n\nT1: 35.\n\n261.\n\nEgypt noted that, in line with the *Soufraki* case,289 the documentary trappings of nationality, such as Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese documents, were no more than *prima facie* evidence of nationality.290 Egypt on the other hand had adduced the unchallenged statements of two Lebanese lawyers, plus the exhibits annexed to those statements, attesting that there was no record of Mr Siag in Saida.291 Egypt had therefore proved a negative - the non-existence of the reality of Lebanese nationality on Mr Siag\u2019s part - and as a result the burden had shifted and it was up to Claimants to prove nationality, which they had failed to do.292 Egypt did not believe it had to prove fraud; instead the Claimants had to prove nationality.293\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki* v *United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case ARB/02/7, Award of 7 July 2004.\n\nT1: 36-37.\n\nT1:37-38.\n\nT1: 38-40\n\nT1: 41.\n\n262.\n\nIt was Egypt\u2019s submission that Claimants\u2019 evidence as to the state of the Lebanese civil registry did not show that Mr Siag\u2019s records had \"fallen through the cracks.\" Mr Ghalayini\u2019s uncontested evidence was that all original records had been saved and maintained.294\n\nT1: 42.\n\n263.\n\nEgypt argued that it was under no obligation to uncover a fraud made against it. It was not required to scrutinise every document for authenticity. Egypt could not be said to have waived its objection because it was insufficiently diligent in discovering Mr Siag\u2019s fraud.295 The catalyst for Egypt making enquiries of the Lebanese Ministry of the Interior in or around August 2007 was that Egypt was by that stage preparing for the merits phase of the case. Egypt had not received from Claimants the documentation it required to support its effective nationality/estoppel arguments, which at the Tribunal\u2019s direction Egypt was going to run in the merits phase of the arbitration, and accordingly Egypt made its own enquiries in Lebanon.296 Baker & McKenzie, not ESLA, had run the investigation into Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality. Claimants\u2019 accusations that diplomatic pressure had been applied to Lebanese officials were reckless and without substance.297\n\nT1: 44-45, 54-55.\n\nT1: 46 - 52.\n\nT1: 56.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Oral Submissions on Lebanese Nationality\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nClaimants submitted four responses to Egypt\u2019s objection in respect of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality: first, Egypt had waived its objection; secondly, whether or not Mr Siag attained Lebanese nationality was irrelevant to the question for the Tribunal, which was whether Mr Siag lost his Egyptian nationality under Egyptian law; thirdly, Egypt\u2019s claim of fraud was not credible; and finally, Egypt had offered no basis to second-guess the contemporaneous documents evidencing Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality.298\n\nT1: 101.\n\n265.\n\nClaimants noted that the Lebanese nationality documents in issue were all in evidence during the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. Mr Siag\u2019s acquisition of Lebanese nationality was debated extensively at that time, indeed Egypt made direct contact with the Lebanese embassy in Cairo on this matter.299 Egypt accordingly knew, or should have known, of its objection during the jurisdictional phase and did not raise its objection \"as early as possible\" as was required by ICSID Rule 41. ICSID Rules 26 and 27 could both be appropriately applied to sanction Egypt\u2019s conduct.300 The Tribunal should consider very carefully whether Egypt had made a credible response to the waiver argument.301 Claimants submitted that the ambit of ICSID Rule 27 included the ICSID Convention, which was part of an ensemble of instruments that must be considered together under the Vienna Convention.302\n\nT1: 79-80, 101 -103.\n\nT1: 81.\n\nT1: 84.\n\nT1: 86.\n\n266.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s submission, Egypt\u2019s statement that it only looked \"carefully\" at Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record some time after the Decision on Jurisdiction was not a defence but an admission of negligence.303\n\nT1: pp. 86-87, 104, 110.\n\n267.\n\nContrary to Egypt\u2019s contention, Mr Siag had adduced documentation to prove that he had acquired Lebanese nationality. Egypt had itself produced a Lebanese nationality certificate for Mr Siag.304\n\nT1: 87.\n\n268.\n\nClaimants further submitted that Egypt\u2019s claim that it did not have access to the files or records of the Lebanese Government was simply untrue, as its conduct in the proceeding had demonstrated.305 Egypt or its agents had made several requests of Lebanese government officials, both before and after the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration, and had received a prompt response on each occasion.306\n\nT1: 87, 105- 108.\n\nT1: 106- 108.\n\n269.\n\nIt was also submitted by Claimants that Mr Siag\u2019s acquisition of Lebanese nationality was a question of personal rather than subject-matter jurisdiction. Egypt\u2019s assertion that it was an issue of subject-matter jurisdiction was a position of convenience and was contrary to the position Egypt had taken during the jurisdictional phase.307\n\nT1: 109-110.\n\n270.\n\nIn addition, Claimants argued that whether or not Mr Siag had ever obtained Lebanese nationality was irrelevant. All the Tribunal needed to assess for the purposes of negative nationality jurisdiction was whether or not Mr Siag had lost his Egyptian nationality. That assessment was, as determined by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction, to be made according to Egyptian nationality law, in particular Article 10 thereof. Under Egyptian law Mr Siag had lost his Egyptian nationality after there had been a formal expression of his Lebanese nationality and he had failed within a year thereafter to apply to retain his Egyptian nationality.308\n\nT1: 112-120.\n\n271.\n\nClaimants submitted that Egypt\u2019s allegations of fraud were simply not credible. Mr Siag could have become an Italian national in order to avoid military service; there was no reason for him to engage in fraud.309 The addition of Mr Siag\u2019s children to his Lebanese passport, his travel into and out of Lebanon on his Lebanese passport, and his renewal of his Lebanese passport, all after he had already been exempted from military service, were the actions of an innocent man who fully believed he was Lebanese.310 Egypt had offered no rebuttal to these assertions.311 Contemporaneous documents were typically seen in legal proceedings as the highest and best evidence. The contemporaneous documents evidencing Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality should be regarded as the best evidence of his nationality as they were untainted by the dispute and the passage of time.312\n\nT1: 122- 123.\n\nT1: 124.\n\nT1: 125.\n\nT1: 129- 130.\n\n272.\n\nLastly Claimants submitted that it was customary in cases involving serious allegations such as fraud and forgery for the party making those allegations to be held to a heightened standard of proof.313 Egypt had failed to meet that standard. Egypt offered two bases for its allegations: the first, that Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record bore no signatures, had been shown to be false - there were signatures on the back page of the Record. The second, that there was no record of Mr Siag in Sayda, was countered by Claimants\u2019 evidence as to the lack of structure in the Lebanese civil registry. Mr Ghalayini was not qualified to counter this evidence.314 It was extraordinary that the Tribunal was being asked to find fraud due simply to the absence of a record in a country with a poor record-keeping system.315\n\nT1: 145.\n\nT1: 146- 147.\n\nT1: 148.\n\nProcedural Order No. 7\n----------------------\n\n273.\n\nAs noted above the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 at the start of the day\u2019s proceedings on 11 March 2008. The terms of that Order have been summarised at paragraph 168 above.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Application to Add an Exhibit\n-------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nOn 14 March 2008 Egypt applied for leave to add to the record a document from the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo regarding Mr Siag\u2019s nationality. Claimants opposed Egypt\u2019s request on 16 March 2008, submitting that the letter in issue had been \"custom-made\" to support Egypt\u2019s application, was the result of further diplomatic pressure on the Lebanese government by Egypt, had no relevance, and carried no evidentiary weight. The Tribunal made a Procedural Direction at the end of the day\u2019s hearing on 17 March 2008, allowing the addition of the exhibit.316 The exhibit was duly submitted on 17 March 2008. It was a letter from the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo dated 13 March 2008, stating that \"it was impossible to prove that there is any entry in the Lebanese Civil Registers for Mr Siag. Moreover, the documents he is carrying cannot be considered to prove that he holds the Lebanese nationality; therefore he cannot be considered Lebanese.\"\n\nT7: 144.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Oral Closing Submissions\n--------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nEgypt made further submissions on its Lebanese nationality application as part of its closing submissions on 18 March 2008. Egypt noted that Claimants\u2019 lawyers had stated that the only relevant question for the Tribunal was whether Mr Siag lost his Egyptian nationality by operation of Article 10 of the Egyptian nationality law. Egypt submitted that no law based on reason and fairness and justice, including the laws of Egypt, could be said to accept spurious or fictitious evidence of foreign nationality if in fact a fraud had been committed. Neither Egyptian law nor the Tribunal could allow fraudulently obtained documents to stand as a basis for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.317\n\nT8: 44-45.\n\n276.\n\nEgypt conceded that it had not submitted evidence that any document had been forged. Any previous use of the word \"forgery\" could therefore be disregarded.318 Mr Siag\u2019s passports were valid, they were not forged. However, they were based on a document - Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record - that was not genuine.319 The same applied to Mr Siag\u2019s nationality certificate - it was based on a spurious Individual Record.320\n\nT8: 45-46.\n\nT8: 46-47.\n\nT8: 47 - 48.\n\n277.\n\nEgypt concluded that the Tribunal could not continue to assert jurisdiction over Mr Siag\u2019s claim in the face of overwhelming evidence of fraud.321\n\nT8: 48.\n\nProcedural Order No. 8\n----------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe hearing concluded on 18 March 2008. As noted above, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 8 that day. The Order directed that no further submissions on the Lebanese nationality objection could be made, with leave or otherwise.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Post-hearing Submissions\n--------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe parties presented their respective post-hearing submissions on 24 April 2008. In large part the parties maintained their previous positions on the Lebanese nationality application. Accordingly their submissions will be only briefly mentioned.\n\n280.\n\nEgypt submitted that it was clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that Mr Siag had never obtained Lebanese nationality. Therefore, he had not lost his Egyptian nationality, and could not recover in this proceeding.322 Egypt then submitted that Mr Siag had set about obtaining Lebanese nationality to avoid Egyptian military service.323\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, p 9.\n\nIbid., p. 10.\n\n281.\n\nIt was also argued by Egypt that Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record was false, and that the documents that came after the Individual Record were therefore based on a false document.324 In Egypt\u2019s submission it was easier for Mr Siag to buy a fraudulent Lebanese document than to obtain Italian nationality.325 The burden of proof was on Mr Siag to prove his Lebanese nationality. Egypt was not culpable for not discovering Mr Siag\u2019s fraud earlier.326\n\nIbid., pp. 10-11.\n\nIbid., p. 11.\n\nIbid., p. 12.\n\n282.\n\nEgypt submitted that the Tribunal could give recognition to Mr Siag\u2019s lack of Lebanese nationality either by revisiting the Decision on Jurisdiction or as part of the merits.327\n\nIbid., p. 13.\n\n283.\n\nLastly, Egypt contended that the principle of continuous nationality - which stated that a claimant must retain the requisite nationality up to the time of the Award -supported Egypt\u2019s case.328\n\nIbid., p. 14.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-hearing Submissions\n-----------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nIn their post-hearing submissions on the Lebanese nationality issue the Claimants reiterated that Egypt could easily have raised its objection during the jurisdictional phase. It did not do so and the application should accordingly be dismissed under ICSID Rules 26 and 27.329\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, p. 5.\n\n285.\n\nClaimants submitted that, although Egypt had re-cast its objection, by abandoning its claim of forgery and by attacking only Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record, the re-cast objection remained groundless. Further, the profound alteration of Egypt\u2019s objection spoke volumes about its credibility.330\n\nIbid., p. 9.\n\n286.\n\nIt was again emphasised by Claimants that Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality was not relevant to his loss of Egyptian nationality,331 and that Egypt\u2019s allegation of fraud was highly implausible and was not supported by the evidence.332\n\nIbid., pp. 10-12.\n\nIbid., pp. 12-18.\n\n**Discussion of Egypt\u2019s \"Lebanese Nationality\" Application**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWas Egypt\u2019s Objection Capable of Being Waived?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nThe appropriate starting point in respect of Egypt\u2019s objection is Claimants\u2019 submission that the objection has been waived. Within that assessment the obvious first issue is Egypt\u2019s counter-submission that its objection could not be waived because it was a matter of subject-matter jurisdiction.333 The basis of Egypt\u2019s assertion is that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention does not extend jurisdiction to disputes where a party has the nationality of both contracting states.334\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions of 31 January 2008, pp. 3 -4; and Rejoinder on the Merits, p. 8.\n\nIbid., p. 3.\n\n288.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that Article 25 does not confer jurisdiction over dual nationals. However, it does not accept the conclusions Egypt has drawn from that fact. The Tribunal does not consider that it is Article 25 that is properly under discussion as having been waived; it is ICSID Rule 41. It is that Rule which grants the right to a party to object to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and it is the right granted by Rule 41 which the Claimants assert has been waived as a result of a failure to invoke that right \"as early as possible.\" The alternative, which is a logical extension of Egypt\u2019s argument, is that a party could never waive an objection to jurisdiction no matter how dilatory had been that party\u2019s conduct, because the right to object to jurisdiction at any time was protected by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal does not accept that proposition.\n\n289.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal upholds the Claimants\u2019 submission that the issue of Mr Siag\u2019s nationality is a matter of personal, not subject-matter, jurisdiction. That was the position taken by Egypt in the jurisdictional phase, and was the basis of the examination made by the Tribunal at the hearing on jurisdiction. The Tribunal sees no reason to depart from that position now, and it does not do so. Egypt\u2019s claim that its objection cannot be waived is therefore dismissed.\n\nHas Egypt waived its objection?\n-------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nICSID Rule 41 states that an objection to jurisdiction \"shall be made as early as possible.\" Claimants\u2019 submissions as to waiver in respect of Egypt\u2019s Lebanese nationality objection largely mirror those made in respect of Egypt\u2019s bankruptcy-based objection. Professor Reisman noted that each of his arguments as to why Egypt\u2019s bankruptcy objection should be deemed waived \"would apply with equal force\" to the Lebanese nationality objection.335 Claimants\u2019 submissions as to the requirements of ICSID Rule 41 are set out above and need not be repeated. The Tribunal notes that Egypt has not contested Claimants\u2019 submissions as to the meaning of Article 41(1) or the phrase \"shall be made as soon as possible.\"\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 7 November 2007, p. 29, n 49.\n\n291.\n\nThe basis of Egypt\u2019s present objection to jurisdiction is the contention that Mr Siag never legitimately acquired Lebanese nationality and thus never shed his Egyptian nationality. Claimants submitted that the information used by Egypt to found its objection was known, or should have been known, to Egypt during the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. Egypt, submit the Claimants, failed to raise its objection as early as possible and was therefore in contravention of ICSID Rules 26 and 27 (the substance of both of which is discussed above).\n\n292.\n\nIt is not contested that Egypt\u2019s objection, first raised on 9 October 2007, was made after the close of time for the parties to make submissions on jurisdiction. Nor has Egypt disputed Claimants\u2019 submission336 that the threshold for liability under Rules 26 and 27 is whether a party knew or reasonably should have known of, and raised, its objection at an earlier stage. Egypt submitted however that it neither knew, nor could reasonably be expected to have known, about the bases of its objection during the jurisdictional phase, because they were occluded by Mr Siag\u2019s fraud.\n\nSee, *e.g.,* T1: 82.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Egypt\u2019s base premise, namely that Egypt could not be expected to assume there had been fraudulent activity on the part of Mr Siag, but the Tribunal does not consider that to be the central issue. The pertinent question in the Tribunal\u2019s view is whether Egypt knew or should have known of the bases of its objection without having to assume fraud. In other words, did Egypt know, or ought it reasonably to have known, that Mr Siag had not acquired Lebanese nationality, without the need to assume fraud?\n\n294.\n\nEgypt\u2019s fraud allegations centred on the alleged invalidity of Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record. Egypt accepted that Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality certificate and two passports were genuine, in the sense that they were not forgeries, but submitted that they were all issued on the basis on an invalid Individual Record, and were accordingly also obtained by fraud.337 It is not in doubt that the Individual Record, as well as the three subsequent documents, were in evidence in these proceedings during the jurisdictional phase. Claimants submitted that Egypt therefore possessed during the jurisdictional phase all the information it now used to support its application, and as a result could, and should, have raised its objection at that time.\n\nT8: 46 - 48.\n\n295.\n\nEgypt has offered several reasons as to why it did not, and could not have, raised its objection during the jurisdictional phase. Egypt\u2019s primary claim, that the issues were concealed by Mr Siag\u2019s fraud, has been discussed. As noted, the Tribunal intends to assess whether Egypt could or should have known of Mr Siag\u2019s alleged lack of Lebanese nationality without having to assume fraud. Each of Egypt\u2019s submissions as to why it could not have done so will now be examined.\n\n*i) Egypt\u2019s Alleged Lack of Access to Official Lebanese Files*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nEgypt submitted that it did not have access to the files and records of the Lebanese Government, and that, as the allegedly invalid documents were Lebanese, it could not have uncovered Mr Siag\u2019s fraud any sooner than it did.338 Egypt further contended that the possibility of fraud on the part of Mr Siag \"only came to light\" after Egypt\u2019s legal team had \"looked carefully\" at Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record some time after the Decision on Jurisdiction had been rendered.339 Upon examination of the Individual Record Egypt considered that \"the way in which it was written in Arabic, its lack of signature, lack of date and general tenor\" were suspicious.340 Thereafter enquiries were made of the relevant Lebanese institutions.\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions of 31 January 2008, p. 4.\n\nIbid. As noted below, this Is In Itself a damaging concession.\n\nIbid.\n\n297.\n\nAs noted above, Egypt had been in possession of Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record throughout the jurisdictional phase; indeed Egypt had submitted the document into evidence itself.341 The Individual Record, along with the other documents pertinent to Mr Siag\u2019s status as a Lebanese national, was subject to considerable scrutiny in the lead up to, and at, the hearing on jurisdiction on 8 - 9 August 2006.342 If the catalyst for Egypt\u2019s further enquiries as to Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality was simply an inspection of Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record, then the Tribunal does not see why that inspection, and the ensuing enquiries, could not have taken place during the jurisdiction phase. A diligent party In a hotly-contested case would surely have done so.\n\nAs Exhibit 22 to its Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\nSee, *e.g.,* Egypt\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction para. 46, Egypt\u2019s Reply Memorial on jurisdiction, para. 21. Although the text in these documents refers to the \"nationality certificate\" rather than the Individual Record, it can be seen from Egypt\u2019s Exhibit 22 that the document in issue is in fact the Individual Record.\n\n298.\n\nBy way of counter Egypt stated that It was under no obligation to Inspect documents for lack of authenticity.343 Egypt, however, offered no reason as to why the \"careful\" inspection of the Individual Record was made at the time it was but was not made during the jurisdiction phase. In a telling concession Egypt\u2019s counsel stated simply that \"someone finally took a careful look.\"344 The Individual Record is a very brief document. The Tribunal is not persuaded by the suggestion that suspicious indicia in a 2-3 page document could not and should not have been picked up during the jurisdiction phase, particularly when the document in question was in Egypt\u2019s possession and was under heavy scrutiny at that time. The Tribunal considers that if the inspection was worth doing in October 2007 it was no less worth doing during the jurisdictional phase, and that such could easily have been accomplished.345\n\nT1: 44-45.\n\nT1: 44.\n\nIn addition, Peter V. Tytell, speaking at the ICCA2002 Congress in London on the subject of \"The Detection of Forgery and Fraud,\" expressed the view that \"the attorney first reviewing the documents must constantly doubt and must constantly question the documents presented...it certainly falls to the attorney\u2019s perception of the meaning of due diligence as to the degree of care with which documents from his/her own side will be vetted, as well as the level of trust that will be placed in the documents received from an adversary\" *(International Commercial Arbitration: Important Contemporary Questions,* ICCA Congress, London, 2002, p. 316).\n\n299.\n\nIt seems that, having made enquiries of Lebanese officials as part of its application, Egypt received a response without undue delay.346 Nothing has been submitted by Egypt to suggest that, had those enquiries been made during the jurisdictional phase, the response would have been any less prompt.\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 29 February 2008, p. 9.\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that Egypt suffered from a lack of access to Lebanese files sufficient to explain the delay in filing its application. The Tribunal further considers that Egypt cannot avoid a finding of waiver by offering as a defence its own failure to inspect carefully a short document that had been in its possession during the jurisdictional phase, during which time that document was under considerable scrutiny.\n\n*ii) Egypt Only Made Enquiries in Lebanon in Preparation for the Merits Phase*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nMr Hafez and Mr Rizkana submitted at the hearing on 10 March 2008 that the reason Egypt made enquiries of the Lebanese Ministry of the Interior as to Mr Siag\u2019s status was that those enquiries were needed in preparation for the merits phase of the arbitration,347 during which Egypt intended to make an \"altogether difference argument\" to those run in the jurisdictional phase.348 That argument was said by Mr Rizkana to be estoppel,349 although that description was later amended by Mr Hafez to \"opposability.\"350 Whichever term is used, Egypt made clear that the focus of its new argument was the doctrine of \"effective nationality.\"351 Mr Hafez stated that opposability was \"fundamentally premised on notions of effective nationality.\"352 This was a topic Egypt had pursued during the jurisdiction phase as is shown by the fact that it was the subject of Professor Vicuna\u2019s partial dissent.\n\nT1: 46-47.\n\nT1: 51.\n\nIbid.\n\nT1: 53.\n\nT1: 51, 53.\n\nT1: 53.\n\n302.\n\nThe thrust of Egypt\u2019s submission appears to be is that it had no reason to make the enquiries it did at an earlier stage because those enquiries related only to the merits phase. In Egypt\u2019s submission, it could not reasonably have been expected to have made those enquiries any earlier than it did. Mr Hafez submitted that, as Egypt had not received the documents it sought from the Claimants in relation to its effective nationality argument, it made direct enquiries of the Lebanese Government.353 Those enquiries resulted in the letter from the Lebanese Ministry of the Interior to the effect that Mr Siag was not a Lebanese national.354\n\nT1: 47-48.\n\nT1: 46.\n\n303.\n\nThe submissions made by Egypt at the March hearing are not easily reconciled with those made in its written submissions of 31 January 2008, which have been discussed. Egypt stated on 31 January 2008 that it made enquiries of Lebanon because Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record appeared suspicious. That submission appears to be supported by Mr Newman, who stated at the hearing that \"something\" called Mr Rizkana\u2019s attention to the inauthenticity of Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record, at which point Mr Souhaid was instructed to make further enquiries.355 Mr Souhaid stated that he was provided with a copy of Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record by Baker & McKenzie, and was instructed to obtain information from the Lebanese government as to its validity.356 However, Mr Hafez submitted that the reason Egypt made enquiries in Lebanon was that it had not received from Claimants the documentation it sought in respect of its effective nationality argument.357 Clearly Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record was not a document that Egypt had to seek from either Claimants or Lebanon, as the Individual Record was already in Egypt\u2019s possession.\n\nT1: 52.\n\nWitness statement of Mr Nadim Souhaid, p. 1.\n\nT1: 47-48.\n\n304.\n\nEven assuming for the sake of argument that Egypt\u2019s submission that it made enquiries in Lebanon because Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record appeared suspicious was incorrectly made, and that the submission of Mr Hafez in respect of document production is to be preferred, the Tribunal remains of the view that Egypt ought to have made its enquiries of the Lebanese authorities during the jurisdictional phase. Mr Siag\u2019s nationality was squarely in issue at that time, and that would have been the appropriate juncture for Egypt to have made any enquiries seeking to challenge his national status.\n\n305.\n\nMr Hafez stated that Egypt was preparing for an \"altogether different argument\" by that stage. However, the doctrine of effective nationality had been argued and ruled on at the hearing on jurisdiction.358 Indeed the Tribunal\u2019s rejection of the doctrine in its Decision on Jurisdiction has been queried by Egypt in later submissions.359 The Tribunal does not therefore accept that effective nationality can be considered an \"altogether different argument\" to anything submitted as part of the jurisdictional phase.\n\nSee Egypt\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, pp. 2-3.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Expert Opinion of Prof Smit of 11 October 2007, pp. 24 *et seq.*\n\n306.\n\nMr Souhaid gave evidence that he was asked to make enquiries of Lebanese officials as to whether Mr Siag was born Lebanese or was naturalised.360 That issue was the subject of Egypt\u2019s letter to the Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May 2006361 and was also debated during the jurisdictional phase. In the Tribunal\u2019s view it also does not constitute an \"entirely different argument\" to those presented for consideration during the jurisdictional stage.\n\nWitness statement of Mr Nadim Souhaid, p. 4.\n\nLetter 23 May 2006 from the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to its Lebanese counterpart (Claimants\u2019 Exhibit 72).\n\n307.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the arguments presented by Egypt as being \"entirely different\" were in fact far removed from arguments already made in the jurisdictional period. The Tribunal is therefore clearly of the view, having considered all relevant facts and circumstances, that Egypt should have made its enquiries of Lebanese officials during the jurisdictional stage.\n\n*iii) Egypt\u2019s Post-hearing Submissions*\n---------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nA final ground upon which Egypt opposed Claimants\u2019 waiver argument is found in Egypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, wherein Egypt stated: \"There is no question, of course, that Egypt did object to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Therefore, it cannot be argued...that Egypt waived its objection to jurisdiction under Rule 41(1) or Rule 27\"362\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, p. 12, n 32.\n\n309.\n\nEgypt\u2019s meaning here is unclear. Undoubtedly, Egypt did object to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction at the outset of these proceedings. That does not mean however that Egypt can make further jurisdictional objections after the jurisdiction phase has been closed without having to adhere to the requirements of the ICSID Rules, in particular Rule 41. Egypt\u2019s 2006 objections to jurisdiction plainly were not waived; they were received and determined. Egypt\u2019s subsequent objections are not, however, protected from the application of Rules 41, 27 and 26 simply because their predecessors were filed in a timely manner.\n\n310.\n\nIt does not seem likely, but if Egypt in fact meant that it could not have waived its bankruptcy and Lebanese nationality objections because it had already made those objections by way of its challenges to jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers that that submission is without merit.\n\n*iv) The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Waiver in Respect of the Lebanese Nationality issue*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nThe Tribunal upholds Claimants\u2019 submission that Egypt could and should have made its objection during the jurisdiction phase and that its failure to do so was in contravention of the requirement laid down by ICSID Rule 41(1), that objections to jurisdiction \"shall be made as early as possible.\"\n\n312.\n\nThe appropriate sanction must now be determined. Egypt argued, as it had done in respect of bankruptcy, that ICSID Rule 27 did not apply to the present facts because \"none of the documents referred to in Rule 27 is the Convention itself and none of the documents referred to contains a provision the same or substantially the same as Article 25 of the Convention. Thus, Article 25 is not one of the provisions that can be waived.\"363 As the Tribunal has ruled, it is not Article 25 that has potentially been waived, it is the right conveyed by ICSID Rule 41 to object to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction (based on a breach of Article 25). Non-compliance with Article 25 can be objected to pursuant to ICSID Rule 41. Failure to state said objection to jurisdiction promptly will render the objection waived, if the party raising the objection knew or should have known of the alleged breach of Article 25 at an earlier stage. It will be apparent from the above that the Tribunal considers that ICSID Rule 27 is applicable in this case. In addition the Tribunal notes that Egypt has raised no issue with the potential application of ICSID Rule 26, upon which the Claimants also base their claim of waiver.\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions of 31 January 2008, p. 4\n\n313.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the Tribunal finds that Egypt\u2019s objection to jurisdiction on the grounds of Mr Siag\u2019s alleged lack of Lebanese nationality shall be disregarded, pursuant to ICSID Rule 26, and has been waived pursuant to ICSID Rule 27.\n\n314.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness the Tribunal will nevertheless examine the merits of Egypt\u2019s contentions. As with the bankruptcy objection, this course of action is appropriate for another reason namely that, following Procedural order No. 7 and as already discussed, Egypt pursued this argument at the merits hearing and in its post-hearing submissions as one of its key objections/defences. Due process will be accorded to Egypt by considering the merits of its Lebanese nationality objection.\n\n**The Merits of Egypt\u2019s \"Lebanese Nationality\" Application**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Burden of Proof\n-------------------\n\n315.\n\nAs to the burden of proof, the general rule, well established in international arbitrations, is that the Claimant bears the burden of proof with respect to the facts it alleges and the Respondent carries the burden of proof with respect to its defences.364\n\n*See* Rosell and Prager, *Illicit Commission and Question of Proof,* 15 Arbitration International 329, 335 (1999) (citing ICC Award 6653 (1993), *reprinted in* 1993 JDI 1053; and also Article 24 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules).\n\n316.\n\nThus, while it is clear that the burden of proof in respect of all jurisdictional objections lies with Egypt, at the merits phase Mr Siag must first prove on the balance of probabilities that he acquired Lebanese nationality, assuming that his acquisition of Lebanese nationality is a relevant factor.365 The Tribunal finds that as at 27 February 2008, even before the merits hearing and before Mr Siag had given oral evidence and defences, Mr Siag had provided extensive *prima facie* evidence of his Lebanese nationality. This evidence has been summarised in paragraph 255 above. The four contemporaneous documents including the Lebanese passports issued in 1990 and 1992 were issued and authenticated by different high ranking Lebanese officials nearly 20 years ago and more than 15 years before the ICSID arbitration, more than adequately satisfy the initial evidentiary burden of the Claimant. This, coupled with the evidence referred to in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the additional evidence of Mr Siag at the merits hearing, and the submissions made on his behalf at the hearing, lead the Tribunal to find affirmatively on all the evidence that Mr Siag acquired Lebanese nationality. The question therefore is whether Egypt can nevertheless establish that fraud, forgery or other misconduct vitiates the acquisition of Lebanese nationality.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the Claimants\u2019 submission of Irrelevance (see para. 270 above) to be correct, but for completeness it nevertheless addresses Egypt\u2019s arguments.\n\n317.\n\nAs noted earlier,366 on 27 February 2008 Claimants stated that Mr Siag had provided extensive *prima facie* evidence of his Lebanese nationality, and that accordingly \"the burden of proof is now on Egypt.\"367 The Tribunal agrees with this contention. On 29 February 2008 Claimants stated: \"As an initial matter, of course, Egypt bears the burden of proof with respect to each of its jurisdictional objections. It is not Claimants\u2019 burden to disprove jurisdictional objections made by Egypt.\"368 For its part, Egypt asserted that it had proved Mr Siag\u2019s non-Lebanese nationality and that accordingly \"the burden has shifted.\"369 The Tribunal does not accept this latter submission. Because negative evidence is very often more difficult to assert than positive evidence, the reversal of the burden of proof may make it almost impossible for the allegedly fraudulent party to defend itself, thus violating due process standards. It is for this reason that Tribunals have rarely shifted the burden of proof.370 There are no special circumstances or good reasons for doing so in this case.\n\nSee para. 248 above.\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 27 February 2008, p. 2.\n\nIbid., p. 10.\n\nT1: 38.\n\nSee Matthieu de Boisseson, *Due process and the specific example of allegations of fraud or corruption notably in the context of investment treaty arbitration,* Paper given at IBA Arbitration Day, Dubai, 16 February 2009.\n\n318.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the burden of proof in respect of all jurisdictional objections and substantive defences lies with Egypt. The Tribunal concurs with the opinion of Professor Reisman, that it is a widely-accepted principle of law that the party advancing a claim or defence bears the burden of establishing that claim or defence.371 That was the determination of the Tribunal in the Decision on Jurisdiction, wherein it held that Egypt bore the burden of proving its objections to jurisdiction.372 The present objection to jurisdiction has also been made by Egypt. The Tribunal considers that the burden of proof therefore rests again with Egypt. That conclusion is strengthened by the ruling of the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction, that Mr Siag was not an Egyptian national at those times relevant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.373 Egypt\u2019s Lebanese nationality objection seeks to change that ruling. In the Tribunal\u2019s view it is for Egypt to sustain its further objection.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman (on jurisdiction) of 31 July 2006, pp. 2-4.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, 11 April 2007, pp. 38 - 39.\n\nIbid., p. 49.\n\nWhat Does Egypt Have to Prove?\n------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that Egypt had to prove fraud, because that was the basis of its present objection. Egypt stated at the March 2008 hearing that it did not think it had to prove fraud.374 This statement may have simply reflected Egypt\u2019s (correct) view that the burden was on Mr Siag to prove his Lebanese nationality, rather than a submission on Egypt\u2019s part that fraud was not an integral element of its case. Indeed, counsel for Egypt expressed a belief that Egypt could prove fraud375 (assuming of course that it had to).\n\nT1: 41.\n\nIbid.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the burden of proof in respect of this objection/defence lies with Egypt. The Tribunal further considers that Egypt must prove fraud, deception, or other dishonest behaviour to succeed in its objection. That may in fact not be disputed. However, the Tribunal nevertheless offers its reasons why such is the case.\n\n321.\n\nFirst and most obviously, Egypt\u2019s submissions, almost without exception, state that there has been fraud. They do not do so in passing, but place great emphasis on the fact. As examples, Egypt has submitted that \"...the issue before the Tribunal is not the procedural one as to whether there has been a waiver or not. Rather, the far more important question is whether this Tribunal has been deceived by the principal claimant before it as to his basis for presenting a claim....\"376 Professor Smit stated that: \"The conclusion that Mr Siag perpetrated a fraud on the Tribunal therefore appears inescapable. Surely, the Tribunal should not give any consequence to the perpetration of this fraud.\"377 At the hearing Egypt\u2019s counsel submitted that \"This Tribunal...cannot allow itself to continue to assert its jurisdiction over Mr Siag\u2019s claim in the face of overwhelming evidence of fraud.\"378 It is clear from these submissions that Egypt sees fraud as a key ingredient of its objection.\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions of 31 January 2008, p. 5; Egypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, p. 11.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Smit of 11 February 2008, p. 6.\n\nT8: 48.\n\n322.\n\nSecondly, in order for Egypt\u2019s objection to prosper, Egypt must prove that Mr Siag did not lose his Egyptian nationality, and thus that he fails the negative nationality requirement of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. As was noted in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, it is well-established that the domestic laws of each Contracting State determine nationality, augmented where appropriate by international law. Both parties accepted and adopted this principle in their submissions on jurisdiction and at the jurisdictional hearing in 2006.379 While Egypt made detailed submissions as to why Mr Siag did not validly acquire Lebanese nationality, it submitted little as to why that fact, if proven, would necessarily mean that Mr Siag did not lose his Egyptian nationality under Egyptian law. Egypt\u2019s submissions appear to assume that one follows the other. However, very little evidence or argument has been adduced in support of that proposition. Those of Egypt\u2019s submissions that do deal with the loss of Mr Siag\u2019s Egyptian nationality under Egyptian law as a result of his acquisition of Lebanese nationality do so almost exclusively on the basis of fraud. For instance, on the final day of the hearing, 18 March 2008, Mr Newman submitted for Egypt that:\n\n\"The argument has been made by Mr Siag\u2019s lawyers that the only relevant question is whether Mr Siag lost his Egyptian nationality under Article 10, and they say that Egyptian law is blind to the application of foreign nationality law, it only looks to the fact of whether there is evidence of some sort of foreign nationality.\n\nI submit to you that neither Egyptian law, nor any other law that claims to be a law based on reason and fairness and justice, can be rationally said to accept spurious or fictitious supposed evidence of foreign nationality, *if in fact a fraud was committed.* Neither Egyptian law nor this Tribunal can stand back and allow *fraudulently obtained* and spurious documents to constitute a foundation for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\"380 [emphasis added]\n\nIn its post-hearing submissions Egypt stated that *prima facie* evidence of nationality (such as Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese passports) was not regarded by Egypt as authentic once shown to be false.381 Egypt cited Article 27 of the Egyptian Nationality Law of 1975, which states that \"whoever gives a false statement or submits untrue documents to the competent authorities for proving or denying nationality for oneself or others shall be subject to an imprisonment....\"382\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction 11 April 2007, pp. 40 - 43.\n\nT8: 44 - 45.\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, pp. 15 - 16.\n\nIbid., p. 16, n 41.\n\n323.\n\nEgypt did submit as to a further reason (other than fraud) why Mr Siag\u2019s acquisition of Lebanese nationality did not cause him to lose Egyptian nationality under Egyptian law. Professor Smit stated that, if Mr Siag had obtained Lebanese nationality at birth, as opposed to through naturalisation, Article 10 of the Egyptian nationality law would not be applicable, as Article 10 applied only when a person gained foreign nationality through a voluntary act.383 Egypt submitted that the fact that Mr Siag was Lebanese by birth meant he had not shed his Egyptian nationality under Egyptian law, which in turn necessitated the Tribunal \"revisiting\" its finding (in its Decision on Jurisdiction) that Mr Siag had lost his Egyptian nationality.384 That submission, based on the contention that Mr Siag was Lebanese by birth, was made by Egypt in the jurisdiction phase and was ruled on by the Tribunal at that time. The Tribunal accepted at that time the statement of Professor Riad, one of the drafters of the Egyptian nationality law, that the Egyptian nationality law did not differentiate between voluntary and involuntary acquisition of foreign nationality.385 According to Professor Riad, and as accepted by the Tribunal, Mr Siag would have lost his Egyptian nationality under Article 10 of the Egyptian nationality law whether he was born Lebanese or was naturalised. The Tribunal sees no reason to depart from that decision. No fresh evidence has been adduced by Egypt to call into question the statements of Professor Riad. The Tribunal confirms that the position it took on this issue in its Decision on Jurisdiction is maintained and adopted as part of this Award.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Smit of 11 October 2007, p. 17.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, pp. 48 - 49.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, p. 44.\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal must now return to the issue of fraud or other dishonest behaviour. The Tribunal considers that whether or not Mr Siag\u2019s Egyptian nationality would have been affected had he committed fraud in the acquisition of his Lebanese nationality is in effect a secondary question. By that the Tribunal does not refer to the importance of that question, but to the fact that it need not be determined unless and until it has been demonstrated by Egypt that a fraud had in fact occurred. If it is shown that a fraud took place, the consequences of that fraud will fall for examination.\n\nThe Standard of Proof\n---------------------\n\n325.\n\nFor reasons summarised above, the Claimants have submitted that Egypt must prove its Lebanese nationality objection to a heightened standard of proof. Chief among the reasons cited by Claimants is that Egypt\u2019s Lebanese nationality application rests upon allegations of fraud, and that claims of such nature are typically held to a heavy standard of proof.386 The standard suggested by the Claimants was the American standard of \"clear and convincing evidence,\" that being somewhere between the traditional civil standard of \"preponderance of the evidence\" (otherwise known as the \"balance of probabilities\"), and the criminal standard of \"beyond reasonable doubt.\"\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 29 February 2008, pp. 10 - 16; T1: 145 - 146.\n\n326.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 submission. It is common in most legal systems for serious allegations such as fraud to be held to a high standard of proof. The same is the case in international proceedings, as can be seen in the cases cited by Claimants, among them the Award of the ICSID Tribunal in *Wena Hotels.387* Egypt\u2019s principal submission was that the burden of proof was on Mr Siag, a submission which the Tribunal has rejected so far as the proof of fraud or other serious misconduct is concerned.388 Egypt did not submit that, if it were required to prove fraud, it should be held to a lesser standard than that argued by the Claimants. The Tribunal accepts that the applicable standard of proof is greater that the balance of probabilities but less than beyond reasonable doubt. The term favoured by Claimants is \"clear and convincing evidence.\"389 The Tribunal agrees with that test.\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case ARB/98/4, Award of 8 December 2000.\n\nSee paras. 316-318 above.\n\nAn alternative term with the same meaning Is that employed In CAS anti-doping arbitrations, namely proof to the \"comfortable satisfaction\" of the Tribunal. See, *e.g.,* Article 3.1 of the World Anti-Doping Authority Code.\n\nDid Mr Siag Obtain Lebanese Nationality by Fraud?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nEgypt has offered several grounds which, it is submitted, demonstrate unequivocally that Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality was obtained through fraud. Mr Siag denies any wrongdoing. Mr Siag stated that he \"had no part in forging any document as part of the process that was undertaken to obtain my Lebanese nationality, nor in authorizing anyone to take such action on my behalf...I would have stood to lose a great deal by pursuing any \"fraudulent\" course of action.\"390 Mr Siag also stated that he \"never had any reason whatsoever to doubt the validity of the documents evidencing my Lebanese nationality\"391 and that he absolutely denied any criminal activity.392 At the March 2008 hearing, when asked by Mr Newman whether Mr Khouly, the man Mr Siag asked for assistance in obtaining Lebanese nationality, told Mr Siag that he was going to obtain Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record by bribery Mr Siag responded \"Of course not, sir... I will never accept it, we had no reason to do this, and I absolutely deny anything like this.\"393 As noted earlier the Tribunal found Mr Siag to be an honest and credible witness and it accepts his denials as truthful, but it is nevertheless appropriate to examine each example presented by Egypt as evidencing fraud or other dishonest behaviour.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr Waguih Siag of 29 February 2008, p. 1.\n\nIbid., p. 7.\n\nT1: 181.\n\nIbid.\n\n328.\n\nBefore doing so it is appropriate to note that on the last day of the hearing, in response to direct questioning from the President, Egypt abandoned its earlier allegation that Mr Siag had \"forged\" the contemporaneous documents of his Lebanese nationality.394 Egypt\u2019s earlier submissions had consistently accused Mr Siag of forging his nationality documents.\n\nT8: 45:24-46: 11.\n\n329.\n\nEgypt\u2019s challenge therefore was obliged to proceed on the basis of accepting that Lebanese officials had issued each of the four contemporaneous documents evidencing Mr Siag\u2019s acquisition of Lebanese nationality and had authenticated each document, and that each contained the various officials features (stamps, seals, letterhead, emblems and holograms) common to documents of this kind.\n\n330.\n\nHaving abandoned its \"forgery\" theory, the argument Egypt pursued as that Mr Siag had procured the four contemporaneous documents by fraud. This contention appeared to involve the suggestion that Mr Siag or an agent had been able to bribe multiple high-ranking officials at the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo, up to and including the Lebanese Ambassador, over a span of years.\n\n331.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that in its submission of 31 January 2008, Egypt alleged that Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese passports were not authentic. Egypt submitted a letter from Brigadier General Wahab of Lebanon, General Director of Public Security, stating that Mr Siag\u2019s two Lebanese passports were \"not genuine.\" However, as demonstrated in the Claimants\u2019 submissions of 29 February 2008, everything about Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese passports was authentic including the fact that he had used the second passport to travel into and out of Lebanon. Furthermore, Mr El Sohi, Lebanon\u2019s former Ambassador to Egypt, had confirmed his signature on the two passports, their authenticity and his recollection that Mr Siag was a prominent member of the Lebanese community in Cairo.\n\n332.\n\nIt therefore became difficult for Egypt to pursue its alternative theory that the four contemporaneous documents had been procured by \"fraud.\" In closing argument, Egypt\u2019s counsel altered Egypt\u2019s position again. Egypt\u2019s final position was that only Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record was procured by fraud, but not forgery, after which it was verified and authenticated by a careless official at the Lebanese Embassy who did not bother to check that it was genuine. Egypt\u2019s argument further required the Tribunal to accept that the three other contemporaneous documents, the Lebanese nationality certificate and the two passports, were all exclusively based on the allegedly fraudulent Individual Record. The other three documents, while neither fraudulent nor forged, were to be characterised as mistakes issues by careless officials at the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo. It is against this background that the Tribunal passes to consider Egypt\u2019s contentions.\n\n*i) Lack of Signatures on Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nThis ground may be dealt with swiftly. It was stated by Mr Souhaid for Egypt that the Clerk of the Personal Affairs Department in Sayda informed him orally that Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record was \"not genuine\" because, *inter alia,* it bore no signatures.395 Mr Souhaid passed this information to Mr Rizkana, one of Egypt\u2019s counsel.396 Claimants submitted that, contrary to Mr Souhaid\u2019s claim, the Individual Record had in fact been signed, both on the first page and on a back page apparently not viewed by Mr Souhaid.397 Claimants exhibited copies of Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record which showed that the document had been signed.398 Quite apart from the hearsay element in his evidence, the Tribunal considers that Mr Souhaid was mistaken in his assertion. To its credit Egypt has not pursued this ground, which plainly offers no evidence of fraud.\n\nWitness statement of Mr Nadim Souhaid, p. 2.\n\nIbid., Exhibit B.\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 29 February 2008, pp. 32 - 33.\n\nIbid., pp. 34-35.\n\n*ii) No record of Mr Siag in Lebanon*\n-------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nThis is perhaps Egypt\u2019s primary argument on the issue of fraud. It was the first example put forward by Egypt as constituting fraud and has been the most vigorously argued. Four documents obtained by Egypt from Lebanese officials were submitted as evidence of Mr Siag\u2019s fraud.\n\n335.\n\nThe first document submitted by Egypt was a letter from Ms Nada Ramez Al Kasty, the head of the Lebanese General Directorate for Personal Affairs (\"GDPA\"), dated 3 October 2007.399 This letter was sent to Egypt\u2019s witness Mr Ghalayini, and stated that \"upon reviewing the Personal Affairs Records of El Saray District, Sayda No. 37, we did not find any registration for Mr Waguih Elie Siag.\" Egypt submitted that \"the inference was warranted that Mr Siag obtained the certification from the Lebanese Consulate in Cairo in September 1989 through improper means....\"400 Mr Ghalayini stated that the import of Ms Al Kasty\u2019s letter was that Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record was \"bogus.\"401 Mr Ghalayini also stated that Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record was \"manifestly fake\" because the number attributed to the Individual Record had not yet been reached,402 and that the registries in Sayda had not yet reached Registry No. 37.403\n\nWitness statement of Mr Abdul Hafiz Ghalayini, Exhibit D.\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions of 9 October 2007, p. 2.\n\nLetter of Mr Ghalayini to Mr Hesham Sha\u2019eer of 3 October 2007 (Egypt\u2019s submissions of 9 October 2007, Exhibit 4).\n\nWitness statement of Mr Abdul Hafiz Ghalayini, p. 3.\n\nIbid.\n\n336.\n\nThe second document submitted by Egypt was a letter dated 26 November 2007, sent from the Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigrants to the Egyptian Embassy in Beirut.404 This document was submitted by Egypt on 31 January 2008. It refers to information received from the Civil Affairs Office in Sayda \"in which it appears that the record subject of enquiry was not found in any of the sectarian registers in Sayda.\" The letter does not refer to Mr Siag by name.\n\nExhibit A to Egypt\u2019s submissions of 31 January 2008.\n\n337.\n\nThe third document upon which Egypt relied is a second letter from Ms Al Kasty, dated 8 December 2007 and sent in response to a request for clarification made by Mr Ghalayini.405 This letter states that \"no record was found for Waguih Elie Siag in Register No 37, El Saray District, Sayda, and no mention was made in the said Register about transfer or deletion of the record which means that it was never recorded in the said register. Therefore, based on the foregoing; The individual record...was taken from a bogus document.\"406\n\nWitness statement of Mr Abdul Hafiz Ghalayini, p. 4.\n\nIbid., Exhibit H.\n\n338.\n\nThe fourth and final document adduced by Egypt was a letter from the Lebanese General Directorate for Public Security, which is undated but was received by Egypt on 29 January 2008. While the first three letters adduced by Egypt focussed primarily on Mr Siag\u2019s Individual record, this letter discussed Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese passports. The letter states that no records had been found for Mr Siag in the Archives Department of the Lebanese Passports Authority, and concluded that those passports were therefore \"not genuine.\"407\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions of 31 January 2008, Exhibit C.\n\n339.\n\nEgypt submitted that the letters of 26 November 2007, 8 December 2007 and January 2008 were \"more than sufficient to prove that Mr Siag has falsely claimed to this Tribunal that he has Lebanese nationality.\"408\n\nIbid., p. 2.\n\n340.\n\nClaimants strongly objected to Egypt\u2019s submission that the absence of records for Mr Siag was evidence of fraud. Claimants submitted that the four documents evidencing Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality (the Individual Record, nationality certificate and two passports) were contemporaneous documents, the validity of which had never before been questioned, and that those documents should be accorded greater weight than Egypt\u2019s evidence, which was \"purposefully produced for use in ongoing litigation.\"409\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 19 February 2008, p. 4.\n\n341.\n\nClaimants further submitted that the civil registry in Lebanon was \"widely regarded as incomplete and plagued by a number of serious problems\"410 and that the absence of a 19-year-old record was not proof of anything, let alone fraud. Claimants cited reports from several institutions to support this contention, among them the European Union\u2019s 2005 Final Report on the Lebanese parliamentary elections, which stated that \"Lebanon has no centralized civil registration system...It suffers from chronic structural, procedural and material deficiencies.\"411 Statements were provided from other organisations and Individuals to similar effect, such as the United Nations, the World Health Organisation and Lebanon\u2019s former Minister of the Interior.412 Claimants concluded that \"quite literally anything\" could have happened to Mr Slag\u2019s Individual Record in the 19 years since its creation and that no reliable conclusion could be drawn from its absence from the register.413\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 29 February 2008, p. 36.\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 29 February 2008, p. 36.\n\nIbid., pp. 37-42.\n\nIbid., p. 43.\n\n342.\n\nWhen questioned at the March 2008 hearing Mr Siag responded as follows:\n\nMr Newman: When you heard that there were no records of your being registered as a Lebanese national in Saida, were you surprised?\n\nMr Siag: Yes, very much surprised.\n\nQ: And why were you surprised?\n\nA: The whole issue is a surprise to me. The entire subject that you are talking now today, about the Lebanese nationality, is a surprise to me. There is no doubt in my mind that I am Lebanese. There is no doubt - nobody has ever contested my Lebanese nationality in Egypt and in Lebanon.414\n\nT1: 174- 175.\n\n343.\n\nIn respect of the reliability of the Lebanese registration system, Mr Souhaid for Egypt stated that he \"confirm[ed] the accuracy of the records in Lebanon\" and that all original records in Sayda were regularly saved on microfilm.415 Mr Ghalayini stated that \"no original registration records have been destroyed\" and that there was accordingly \"no possibility\" that Mr Siag could be registered without his registration being saved to government files.416 Mr Newman submitted for Egypt at the merits hearing that the documentation adduced by Claimants in respect of the state of Lebanon\u2019s civil registry system was of no value, and noted that the UN report proffered by Claimants also stated that records of birth and death in Lebanon were likely to be complete.417\n\nWitness statement of Mr Nadim Souhaid, p. 3.\n\nWitness statement of Mr Abdul Hafiz Ghalayini, p. 3.\n\nT1: 41 -42.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal will first examine the letter most recent in time, namely that received by Egypt on 29 January 2008 which deals with Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese passports. The statement in that letter that Mr Siag\u2019s passports are \"not genuine\" is in contrast to the submissions of Egypt\u2019s counsel at the 10 March 2008 hearing. Dr Aboulmagd submitted at the hearing that: \"What we have here very clearly are two things: a document that was not genuine, on the basis of which everybody was misled to believe that the passports are genuine. They are not forged. The Lebanese Embassy in Egypt was misled by a document that is not genuine... so if we talk about forgery in the physical sense, no, the passports were valid, I mean they were not forged; but they were based absolutely and exclusively on a document that is not genuine....\"418 Dr Aboulmagd\u2019s submission must be taken to mean that Mr Siag\u2019s passports were genuine, in the sense that they were not forged, but that they were nonetheless invalid because their issue flowed directly from an invalid document, namely Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record.\n\nT8: 46-47.\n\n345.\n\nOne would assume therefore that there would be a record of Mr Siag\u2019s passports in the appropriate Lebanese authority. Such is suggested by the letter from the Lebanese Embassy in Cairo to the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 1 June 2006, which states that following a review of Mr Siag\u2019s files, \"Mr Siag is the holder of Lebanese passport No....\"419 The Tribunal considers that the letter of 29 January 2008 stating that Mr Siag\u2019s passports were not genuine must be viewed in light of Egypt\u2019s most recent submissions, which do not appear to support its content, and in light of the letter from the Lebanese Embassy of 1 June 2006. The Tribunal does not consider that the 29 January 2008 letter supports the allegation of fraud or misconduct.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 73.\n\n346.\n\nThe letters dated 3 October 2007, 26 November 2007 and 8 December 2007 each relate to Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record. Although the wording is stronger in the 8 December letter than in the others, the thrust of the three letters is the same: that there is no record of Mr Siag in Sayda. Egypt contends that this provides clear evidence of fraud. The Tribunal does not accept that submission. There are many possible explanations for the apparent absence of a record of Mr Siag in Sayda. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants\u2019 evidence as to the reliability of the Lebanese civil register is compelling. Claimants have adduced numerous reports from respected institutions attesting to the difficulties inherent in the Lebanese registration system. These reports provide, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, an entirely plausible alternative explanation as to the absence of Mr Siag\u2019s records. The Tribunal attaches little weight to the statements of Mr Souhaid and Mr Ghalayini420 attesting to the reliability of the Lebanese registration system. No substantiating evidence is offered by Mr Souhaid or Mr Ghalayini. Neither witness was presented as, or held themselves out to be, an expert in Lebanese registration systems, or even as people with broad experience thereof. While Mr Souhaid and Mr Ghalayini may well hold the views they have expressed, the Tribunal prefers Claimants\u2019 strong evidence to the contrary on this matter. The Tribunal considers that, even viewed alone, the letters adduced by Egypt do not amount to evidence of fraud or misconduct of any kind. In the face of Claimants\u2019 evidence, both as to Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality and as to the state of Lebanon\u2019s civil registry, Egypt\u2019s evidence falls well short of the required standard. It follows that the Tribunal does not consider that the letters of 3 October 2007, 16 November 2007 and January 2008 are proof of fraud, viewed either individually or collectively.\n\nLebanese lawyers and witnesses for Egypt (see paras. 229 and 243).\n\n347.\n\nMr Souhaid offered an alternative reason to question the validity of Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record: that the Sayda registry did not extend to No.37421 (37 being the registry number recorded on Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record). Mr Souhaid\u2019s evidence was that he was informed by the Registrar in Sayda that there was no register number 37 in Sayda.422 Mr Ghalayini similarly stated that the Sayda registries had not yet reached No. 37.423 The Tribunal is not persuaded that this hearsay evidence provides any evidence of fraud. No evidence is offered to support the statements of Mr Souhaid and Mr Ghalayini. Egypt has submitted that it presented \"statements by officials of the Lebanese government - directly and not as reported by anyone else -that all three documents presented by Mr Siag - the Individual Record and two passports - were false and fraudulent in that they bear numbers that are non-existent in the records of the Lebanese government....\"424 That is not the case. The letters exhibited to Mr Ghalayini\u2019s statement offer, if anything, evidence to the contrary. The letter from Ms Al Kasty dated 3 October 2007 states \"...upon reviewing the Personal Affairs Records of El Saray District, Sayda, No. 37, we did not find any registration for Mr Waguih Elie Siag.\"425 Ms Kasty\u2019s letter of 8 December 2007 states that \"no record was found for Waguih Elie Siag in Register No. 37, El Saray District, Sayda, and no mention was made in said register about transfer or deletion of the record...,\"426 Both letters refer to searches having been made of Register No. 37; neither states that such a register does not exist.\n\nWitness statement of Mr Nadim Souhaid, p. 2.\n\nIbid.\n\nWitness statement of Mr Abdul Hafiz Ghalayini, p. 3.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, p. 7.\n\nWitness statement of Mr Abdul Hafiz Ghalayini, Exhibit D.\n\nIbid., Exhibit H.\n\n348.\n\nA further contention by Mr Ghalayini was that \"the number of the Individual Record provided by Mr Siag simply does not exist, since the documents on which the document is supposedly based have not yet reached that number.\"427 The aim of this statement is not fully clear. If by it Mr Ghalayini was merely referring to the registry number, then that submission has been discussed. If Mr Ghalayini\u2019s intended message was that the number of Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record had not been reached, that message falls far short of evidencing fraud. It is unsupported and has not been developed by Egypt.\n\nIbid., p. 3.\n\n*iii) Mr Siag\u2019s Intention* Was *to Avoid Military Service*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nMr Siag does not deny that he did not wish to undergo compulsory military service and that his acquisition of Lebanese nationality helped him avoid such.428 Where the parties differ is that Egypt submits that that was Mr Siag\u2019s only reason (or certainly his primary reason) for desiring Lebanese nationality,429 whereas Mr Siag states that the main reason he acquired Lebanese nationality was that he had always regarded himself as Lebanese.430\n\nWitness statement of Mr Waguih Slag of 29 February 2008, p. 17; and T1: 159.\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, p. 10; and T1: 35.\n\nT1: 158- 159.\n\n350.\n\nAs discussed, it is the task of Egypt to prove that Mr Siag acquired Lebanese nationality through fraud. Even if Mr Siag\u2019s sole motivation in acquiring Lebanese nationality was to avoid military service, the Tribunal considers that it would require a large leap of logic to infer from those facts that Mr Siag would commit fraud in order to achieve that end. Without further proof that is exactly what Egypt has asked the Tribunal to do: to infer that Mr Siag\u2019s desire to avoid military service was so overwhelming that it would prompt him to take the risky step of attempting to defraud or mislead the Lebanese Government. The Tribunal does not make that inference. It accepts as truthful Mr Siag\u2019s detailed evidence as to his personal and emotional ties to Lebanon,431 and that those ties were at least as great a driving force in his acquisition of Lebanese nationality as was the desire to avoid military service.432 The Tribunal also accepts Claimants\u2019 submission that it is highly unlikely that Mr Siag would have perpetrated a fraud on the Lebanese government in order to avoid military service when it was not disputed that he could have attained the same end by acquiring Italian nationality.433 The Tribunal considers that this latter submission has great force. Egypt\u2019s submissions that \"It was easier to buy a fraudulent document that did the trick\"434 and that \"since Mr Siag only satisfied the requirement of marriage to an Italian in September of 1988, it can be inferred that he was concerned about how much time would pass before the Italian bureaucracy permitted him to obtain Italian nationality\"435 are speculative, unsubstantiated, and unpersuasive. For those reasons the Tribunal does not consider that Mr Siag\u2019s desire to avoid military service provides any evidence that he committed fraud to do so.\n\nWitness statement of Mr Waguih Slag 29 February 2008, pp. 1 - 6.\n\nIbid, and T1: 160.\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, p. 15.\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, p 11.\n\nIbid., p. 12, n 31.\n\n*iv) Mr Siag Paid $5.000 to Mr Khouly to Help Obtain Lebanese Nationality*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nThat Mr Siag paid US$5,000 to Mr Khouly for his work in assisting Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality application was freely acknowledged. Egypt contended that $5,000 was an unduly large sum for the work that was carried out. Egypt submitted the following: \"...it involved the payment of what seems to be a very large amount of money to obtain this document, $5,000, to an individual whose name is not recalled but who was or evidently represented himself to be a Lebanese lawyer\"436... what was done in order to get out of military service in terms of documentation was done. It was important, it cost a lot of money, more than you would think would have to be paid for somebody to get an extract of what the documents say in Sayda.\"437 Counsel for Egypt then enquired of Mr Siag: \"Did [Mr Khouly] tell you in words or in substance that he was going to bribe anyone in Lebanon to get this document?\"438 Egypt\u2019s clear inference is that Mr Siag would not have paid Mr Khouly such a large sum were there not more going on than has been admitted to.\n\nT1: 35.\n\nT1: 38.\n\nT1: 181.\n\n352.\n\nAs an initial point the Tribunal is not persuaded that there is anything unusual, let alone suspicious, in hiring someone to assist with immigration and nationality applications. Immigration consultants all over the world routinely carry out similar tasks. While the Tribunal accepts that US$5,000 may be a large amount of money in Egypt, it is not convinced that it is so large a sum when it is taken into account that Mr Khouly\u2019s travel and accommodation costs were included.439 In any event the payment made to Mr Khouly was certainly not so great as to justify the inference that it would only have been paid in consideration of fraudulent activity. The suggested inference that this payment evidences fraud is rejected.\n\nT1: 154.\n\n*v) Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record Bears the False Inscription \"Lebanese for more than 10 years\u2019\u2019*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nAlthough there was some initial doubt over the translation, it is not in doubt that Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record bears this inscription or one to similar effect. Egypt submits that this proclamation is in clear contrast to Mr Siag\u2019s evidence that he became Lebanese in 1989. Egypt submitted that \"...it became evident that this was in fact a fraud.\"440 Claimants submit that this phrase merely indicates that the individual concerned had Lebanese origins and did not have to wait ten years following the acquisition of Lebanese nationality to be allowed to participate in certain aspects of Lebanese public life, such as holding public office.441\n\nT1: 54.\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, p 13.\n\n354.\n\nThe Tribunal prefers the submissions and evidence of the Claimants on this matter. The meaning of the phrase in question was debated at length during the jurisdictional phase, as part of the issue as to whether Mr Siag was Lebanese by birth. Claimants at that time made the same submission they are making now, that \"more than 10 years\" simply refers to Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese origins.442 Claimants adduced Lebanese authority to substantiate its claims during the jurisdictional phase.443 Egypt did not at that time challenge Claimants\u2019 evidence. The Tribunal accepts Claimants\u2019 evidence as to the meaning of the phrase \"Lebanese for more than 10 years\" in the present context.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder on jurisdiction, pp. 26 - 27.\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, p. 14.\n\n355.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s acceptance of Claimants\u2019 proffered meaning of the phrase in issue, it follows that there is in the Tribunal\u2019s view no discrepancy between the inscription on Mr Siag\u2019s Individual Record and Mr Siag\u2019s claim that he acquired Lebanese nationality in 1989. The two are not mutually exclusive. The Tribunal accordingly finds no clear and convincing evidence of fraud under this head. This finding is strengthened by the oral evidence of Mr Siag, which as has been noted was impressive. Mr Siag testified that \"...the meaning of it - if you are from Lebanese origin you don\u2019t have to wait ten years to practice your Lebanese rights. Even if you are naturalised Lebanese only six months ago they will still write the same sentence, \"Lebanese for over ten years\" because you are from Lebanese origin.\"444 He stated that he had only learned of the exact operation of this phrase a year or so ago,445 and that at the time he obtained his Individual Record, \"I did not look at the document the same way that I\u2019m looking at it today...It\u2019s not that I took the document and started looking at it like this, word by word, and asked: what is this and what is that? I took the document and we continued the meeting.\"446 The Tribunal considers that Mr Siag\u2019s evidence was truthful and honestly given.\n\nT1: 166.\n\nT1: 166- 167.\n\nT1: 164.\n\n**The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Fraud and the Lebanese Nationality Objection**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons the Tribunal finds that insufficient evidence has been adduced by Egypt to prove fraud, forgery, deception or other serious misconduct on the part of Mr Siag. The items of evidence relied upon by Egypt, whether taken individually or collectively, fall far short of satisfying the necessary evidential burden. Indeed the Tribunal, having heard and assessed the evidence and observed the demeanour of Mr Siag, totally rejects the allegations made against him. Egypt has made very serious allegations against Mr Siag but has clearly failed to prove them. Its rhetorical references to \"unequivocal\" and \"inescapable\" evidence of fraud were a massive overstatement.\n\n357.\n\nAs Egypt has failed to prove that Mr Siag attained his Lebanese nationality fraudulently, it follows that Egypt has not demonstrated that Mr Siag\u2019s loss of Egyptian nationality was, or could be argued to have been, invalid, even if that was a relevant consideration. This situation is clearly distinguishable from that in the *Soufraki* case cited by Egypt,447 in that Mr Soufraki lost his Italian nationality because it was proved conclusively that his nationality documents had been issued by Italian authorities without full knowledge of the relevant facts. Moreover, in that instance Mr Soufraki was unable to prove that he remained an Italian citizen. In the present case, Egypt bears the burden of proof and has been unable to demonstrate that the strong evidence of Lebanese nationality advanced by Mr Siag should be disregarded by the Tribunal. Egypt has therefore not succeeded in convincing the Tribunal that it ought to reverse its earlier carefully considered decision that Mr Siag was not an Egyptian national at those times material to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. In any event, even had there been fraud, the Tribunal has accepted in its Decision on Jurisdiction that Article 10 of Egypt\u2019s Nationality Law is \"blind\" to the operation of Lebanese nationality law. As a consequence, under Egyptian law, the first issuing of a Lebanese passport to Mr Siag was sufficient for him to lose his Egyptian nationality, in the absence of the requisite declaration of intent to keep Egyptian nationality pursuant to Article 10.\n\nSee para. 261 (and n. 289) above.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Mr Siag was not an Egyptian national at those times relevant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Egypt\u2019s objection to jurisdiction/defence based on a breach of the negative nationality requirement of Article 25 therefore fails once again and is dismissed.\n\n359.\n\nIt necessarily follows that the Tribunal does not find the new evidence adduced by Egypt to be sufficient to warrant the \"withdrawal\" or revisiting of the Decision on Jurisdiction, as requested by Egypt. As recorded above, the Tribunal confirms and adopts its Decision on Jurisdiction as part of this Award.\n\n**Summary of the Tribunal\u2019s Determinations on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Egypt\u2019s objections to jurisdiction on the grounds of Mr Siag\u2019s alleged bankruptcy and claimed lack of Lebanese nationality were not brought \"as early as possible\" and have been waived. Even had Egypt\u2019s objections not been waived the Tribunal considers that they fail on their merits.\n\n**Why the Tribunal Did Not Suspend the Proceedings**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nIt will be apparent from this lengthy examination of Egypt\u2019s late jurisdictional objections that the Tribunal did not accede at any point to Egypt\u2019s request that the proceedings be suspended when it raised those objections after the Decision on Jurisdiction. This matter was considered by the Tribunal. Its view was that it would be inappropriate and unfair to the Claimants to allow intermittent further jurisdictional objections, made after the Decision on Jurisdiction and for the most part connected to the issues determined in that Award, to impede the orderly progress and resolution of the arbitration according to an established timetable for the hearing on the merits. Bearing in mind the powerful objections of the Claimants to these post-jurisdictional decision objections, particularly that they were not made \"as early as possible\" in terms of ICSID Rule 41(1) and that they had been waived pursuant to ICSID Rules 26 and/or 27, it was considered preferable to establish a concurrent timetable to consider these additional objections. This was especially so since it was also argued by Claimants that the objections were largely the same as had already been considered in the jurisdictional decision.\n\n362.\n\nThe applicable ICSID Rule 41 (3)448 provides as follows:\n\n\"Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the proceeding on the merits shall be suspended. The President of the Tribunal, after consultation with its other members, shall fix a time limit within which the parties may file observations on the objection.\"\n\nThis may be contrasted with the current provision, which states that:\n\n\"Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits. The President of the Tribunal, after consultation with its other members, shall fix a time within which the parties may file observations on the objection.\"\n\nJanuary 2003 version.\n\n363.\n\nThe difficulty with Article 41 as previously worded, which was the article applicable in this case, was that on its face it appeared to be mandatory provision requiring suspension on the mere raising of a jurisdictional objection. However, that provision is obviously intended to deal with the usual situation where there has been no decision on jurisdiction at the time the objection to jurisdiction was raised. As the Claimants pointed out,449 there has been only one other instance in the lengthy history of ICSID arbitration where there has been a suspension after a decision on jurisdiction.450\n\nSee *e.g.,* Claimants\u2019 submissions 26 September 2007, p. 2.\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, a.s. v. The Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case ARB/97/4.\n\n364.\n\nHowever, it is not the case that the apparently mandatory wording of Article 41(3) must trump all other provisions of the ICSID Rules. If applied automatically to every jurisdictional objection which is raised after a decision on jurisdiction had been rendered, it would be possible, in theory, for a party, by seeking to raise insubstantial variations or supplementations to its earlier arguments, to prevent the Tribunal from ever reaching the merits. A party\u2019s episodic and sequential manufacturing of new jurisdictional arguments could eventually destroy the right of an individual Claimant to its \"day in Court\" because such conduct could easily exhaust the limited resources of such a Claimant and render him or her unable to continue.\n\n365.\n\nTo be specific, even though there was nothing to prevent Egypt from raising further jurisdictional objections after the decision on jurisdiction, it could not, by means of either subsequent reiteration of earlier objections or the development of new objections, insist upon suspension if such would imperil the Tribunal\u2019s status, legitimacy or effectiveness. The Tribunal has an overriding duty to preserve the integrity of the proceedings and ensure fairness to both parties. It would be most unfair if a Respondent could impede the fair resolution of the proceedings by raising a series of additional objections to jurisdiction after a decision on jurisdiction had been issued, especially if those objections were no more than variations of objections already taken, or points which through greater diligence could have been discovered earlier.\n\n366.\n\nA Tribunal has inherent power to take measures to preserve the integrity of the proceedings.451 In part that inherent power finds as a textual foot-hold Article 44 of the Convention, which authorises the Tribunal to decide \"any question of procedure, not expressly dealt with in the Convention, the ICSID arbitration rules, or any rule agreed by the parties.\"452 ICSID Rule 41 does not specifically provide for a situation where there are new challenges to jurisdiction after the issuing of an award on jurisdiction. More broadly, there is an inherent power of an international tribunal to deal with any issues necessary for the conduct of matters falling within its jurisdiction. That power exists independently of any statutory reference.453 In the specific circumstances of the present case it was, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, both necessary and appropriate to take action under its inherent power to ensure the continuity and fairness of the proceedings. It was for these reasons that it was felt that the best way forward was to allow Egypt\u2019s additional jurisdictional objections to be considered and determined in the way that has been described above, without automatically suspending the proceedings.\n\nSee Scheurer, *supra* note 162, at p. 683, where the learned author states:  \n \"An ICSID tribunal\u2019s power to close gaps In the rules of procedure Is declaratory of the Inherent power of any tribunal to resolve procedural questions In the event of *lacunae.* In exercising this power, the tribunal may not go beyond the framework of the Convention, the Arbitration Rules and the parties\u2019 procedural agreements but must, first of all, attempt to close any apparent gaps through the established methods of Interpretation for treaties and other legal documents. But the tribunal Is free of the constraints of procedural law In any national legal system of law, Including that of the tribunal\u2019s seat (see also paras. 3, 20 *supra).*  \n ICSID tribunals have exercised their procedural discretion by formulating general rules for the proceedings before them or by making specific decisions. They have done this earlier In the form of procedural orders or Informally. The Arbitration Rules provide In this context:  \n**Rule 19**  \n Procedural Orders  \n The Tribunal shall make the orders required for the conduct of the proceeding.\"  \n The doctrine of Inherent, i.e. non-statutory, powers has been applied by the International Court of Justice and other International tribunals In a number of different contexts. Notably, Inherent powers have been Invoked In order summarily to dismiss proceedings lacking even a prima facie jurisdictional foundation, suspend proceedings In certain cases of parallel related litigation, and refuse to hear vexatious claims. *See* C.

It was submitted that Egypt had ignored numerous rulings of its own courts in favour of Claimants. In particular these rulings were: the 21 July 1996 decision of the Cairo Administrative Court enjoining the execution of Resolution 83 purporting to cancel the contract454; the affirmation of the Cairo Administrative Court\u2019s injunction by the Supreme Administrative Court on 5 February 1996455; the 7 August 2001 ruling of the supreme Administrative Court reversing the 7 September 1999 ruling in favour of Egypt from the Cairo Administrative Court (sitting with different judges to those who had originally enjoined Resolution 83) and cancellation of Resolution 83456; the 28 March 2002 decision of the Cairo Administrative Court enjoining Resolution 279, which had again purported to cancel the contract457; The decision of the Cairo Administrative Court of 6 June 2002 refusing to stay the injunction of Resolution 279458; the ruling of the Supreme Administrative Court of 24 May 2005 dismissing Egypt\u2019s appeal against the injunction of Resolution 279.459\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, p. 36.\n\nIbid., p. 44.\n\nIbid., pp. 46-47.\n\nIbid., p. 51.\n\nIbid., p. 52.\n\nIbid., p. 53.\n\n370.\n\nClaimants submitted that Egypt had seized Claimants\u2019 property with five separate decrees (Ministerial, Prime Ministerial and Presidential), and had seized physical control of the property on two occasions. In Claimants\u2019 submission Egypt\u2019s actions amounted to a direct expropriation of Claimants\u2019 property, and were in violation of Article 5(1)(ii) of the BIT.460 Further, although the Tribunal need not get this far, Egypt\u2019s actions also constituted indirect expropriation.461\n\nIbid., pp. 67, 73.\n\nIbid., pp. 68, 75.\n\n371.\n\nClaimants argued that Article 5(1)(ii) of the BIT prohibited expropriation except when five cumulative factors were present. To be legal an expropriation must have been made for a public purpose in the interest of the expropriating state; it must have been made according to legal procedures; it must have been made on a non-discriminatory basis; it must have been made in accordance with due process of law; and it must have been accompanied by adequate and fair compensation. In Claimants\u2019 submission Egypt\u2019s actions did not satisfy any of these requirements.462 As a failure to meet any one of the requirements for legal expropriation rendered an expropriation illegal, Egypt\u2019s seizures of Claimants\u2019 land were clearly illegal.463\n\nIbid., pp. 68, 75-85\n\nIbid., pp. 69, 78.\n\n372.\n\nIt was further submitted by Claimants that Article 5(1)(i) of the BIT provided an even stricter standard of protection from expropriation than did Article 5(1)(ii). Article 5(1)(i) precluded even temporary limitation of an investor\u2019s right to ownership, possession, control or enjoyment of his or her investment. The terms of Article 5(1)(i) made clear that Egypt and Italy had agreed to prevent limits on ownership, possession, control or enjoyment that fell short of \"traditional expropriation.\"464 There was no need for the Tribunal to reach the \"quasi-expropriation\" standard of Article 5(1)(i), as there was no doubt that an illegal expropriation had been carried out, but in the unlikely event that the Tribunal disagreed, Article 5(1)(i) had clearly been violated.465\n\nIbid., p. 86.\n\nIbid., p. 86.\n\n373.\n\nClaimants contended that they had explicitly sought the protection of the Egyptian authorities in relation to their property. Multiple pleas for protection by Mr Siag and Dr Abou Zeid had been officially recorded. Despite these pleas Egypt had failed to provide the full protection sought, and guaranteed by Article 4(1) of the BIT, and was accordingly liable to the Claimants.466\n\nIbid., pp. 87-96.\n\n374.\n\nIn addition, it was submitted, Egypt had failed to treat Claimants\u2019 investment fairly and equitably, as required by Article 2(2) of the BIT. The \"fair and equitable\" standard of protection was today composed of several distinct \"strands,\" including \"due process,\" transparency, an investor\u2019s legitimate expectation, discrimination, harassment or coercion, and bad faith. A remarkable feature of this case was that Egypt had violated every component of the fair and equitable standard recognised to date.467\n\nIbid., pp. 96-121.\n\n375.\n\nArticle 2(2) of the BIT also precluded unreasonable or discriminatory measures being taken against investments. Claimants submitted that, while the use of the disjunctive \"or\" made clear that either \"unreasonable\" or \"discriminatory\" measures were precluded, in the present case the measures taken by Egypt in confiscating Claimants\u2019 property were both unreasonable and discriminatory.468 Article 2(2) applied not only to situations where an investment was \"impaired by\" unreasonable or discriminatory measures, but also to situations where the investment was \"subjected to\" unreasonable or discriminatory measures. \"Subjected to\" offered a higher standard of protection to investors, but Egypt\u2019s behaviour violated both standards.469\n\nIbid., pp. 121 - 126.\n\nIbid., p. 121.\n\n376.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 submission Egypt had also breached the most favoured nation provisions enshrined in Articles 3, 4 and 6 of the BIT. Egypt had concluded and ratified at least eight BIT\u2019S that required it to observe any obligation that it had entered into with regard to an investment (an \"umbrella clause\").470 The Italy-Egypt BIT did not contain an umbrella clause. Consequently, Egypt had accorded investors under other BIT\u2019S more favoured treatment than it had offered Italian investors such as the Claimants.471 Claimants invoked the most favoured nation provisions in Article 3 of the Italy-Egypt BIT in order to benefit from the treatment accorded by Egypt to investors under those BITs that contained umbrella clauses.472 Claimants stated that, once imported, the umbrella clause offered protection to Claimants for breaches of obligations not covered by the BIT. In the present case Egypt had violated three varieties of obligation protected by the umbrella clause: it had violated various obligations owed to Claimants under Egyptian law; it had violated its obligation to respect the rulings of its judiciary in cases between the Claimants and the Government; and it had violated its obligations under the contract for the sale of the property in Taba.473 The third violation was beyond dispute as Egypt\u2019s courts had already ruled that Egypt\u2019s termination of the contract was illegal.474\n\nIbid., pp. 127- 128.\n\nIbid., p. 128.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., p. 130.\n\nIbid.\n\n377.\n\nClaimants summarised their submissions on the merits thus: Egypt\u2019s conduct had been deplorable, and violated every one of the principal protections offered to foreign investors other than the guarantee of national treatment, any one of which was sufficient to render Egypt liable to Claimants.475 Moreover, it was submitted that Egypt had on at least two occasions admitted its liability to Claimants.476 The first such admission came in Egypt\u2019s letters to Mr Siag in or around October 2003 stating that the Ministry of Tourism would \"assume the settlement of the company\u2019s [Siag\u2019s] rights and compensating it.\" The second claimed admission of Egypt\u2019s liability was provided by the State Commissioning Authority in the context of Siag\u2019s lawsuit against Presidential Decree No. 205 and Prime Ministerial Resolution No. 315. The Authority advised that the Property did not belong to the State having been sold to Siag in 1989. It further advised the Court to annul the Presidential and Prime Ministerial Decrees and noted that Egypt had, in one of its court pleadings, acknowledged that Mr Siag had a right to the Property.\n\nIbid., pp. 130-131.\n\nIbid., p. 62.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits\n--------------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the merits was presented on 12 October 2007. Included with the Counter-Memorial were the expert opinions on liability of Professor Hans Smit dated 11 October 2007, and Professor Ivan Shearer dated 15 June 2007 (with an addendum dated 20 June 2007).\n\n379.\n\nEgypt first contended that ownership of the land at Taba was only to be transferred to Siag Touristic once all phases of the project had been carried out.477 It appeared that Siag Touristic was never serious about completing the project because, at the time the first decision to cancel the project was made, only 7% to 11% had been completed, with only six months remaining to complete phases I and II of the project.478\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, p. 5.\n\nIbid., p. 6.\n\n380.\n\nSecondly Egypt submitted that Siag Touristic had been taking the wrong steps to market the project in Taba, with the likely result that a security issue would have developed. This was because Siag Touristic had entered into a contract with Lumir Holding,479 an Israeli entity,480 under which Lumir would have been granted certain rights in the project without the consent of the Administrative Authority.481 It was these failures that led the Minister of Tourism to issue a decree cancelling the contract in May 1995.482 Once Siag Touristic had declared that it would change its strategy the decree was revoked and a grace period granted.483 However, Siag Touristic failed to cease its violations, which caused the Minister of Tourism to issue Decree No. 83 cancelling the contract for non-fulfilment of contractual commitments.484\n\nAlternatively spelt as \"Lumalr.\"\n\nIt is an Israeli company.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, p. 6.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., pp. 6-7.\n\n381.\n\nEgypt next submitted that, following the decision of the Egyptian Supreme Administrative Court which ruled that the Minister of Tourism did not have jurisdiction to issue Decree No. 83, the Tourism Development Authority (\"TDA\"), which was bound to protect the interest of the investments in the area, issued Resolution No. 279 in 2001, again cancelling the contract. The TDA was bound to issue the Resolution because Siag Touristic was still dealing with Lumir Holdings, which raised issues of national security.485 The TDA, as an administrative authority, was bound to protect the interests of the public domain, and as such the TDA could not be judged in the same way as if it were one of two private contracting parties.486\n\nIbid., p. 7.\n\nIbid., pp. 7-8.\n\n382.\n\nEgypt contended that the expropriation of Claimants\u2019 land pursuant to Prime Ministerial Decree No. 799 and Presidential Decree No. 315 was for a public purpose, that being the exportation of natural gas. It was for this reason that ownership of the land was transferred to the Al-Sharq Gas Company.487\n\nIbid., pp. 8-9.\n\n383.\n\nAs to compensation Egypt submitted that the Explanatory Memorandum to Prime Ministerial Decree No. 799 specifically mentioned that adequate compensation would be paid to the rightful owners of the land. Accordingly this could not be classed as a case of confiscation.488 The TDA invited Siag Touristic to meet and discuss the level of compensation that would be paid. However, Siag Touristic\u2019s demands were unrealistically high, and bore no relationship to the price paid, the amount of the investment, or Siag Touristic\u2019s earlier claims.489\n\nIbid., p. 9.\n\nIbid., pp. 9-10.\n\n384.\n\nEgypt next submitted that Siag Touristic had purported to transfer 150,000 m\u00b2 of the property at Taba to Siag Taba. If such transfer had actually occurred, it was in violation of Article 10 of the contract, which stated that Siag Touristic could not transfer all or part of the property to a third party other than with Egypt\u2019s consent, and with 50% of the value going to Egypt.490\n\nIbid., p. 10.\n\n385.\n\nEgypt then referred to the matter of the nationality of the investors. The buyer of the land at Taba was Siag Touristic. In 1995 Mr Siag increased his shareholding in Siag Touristic to 88.15%. The Tribunal held in its Decision on Jurisdiction that the Claimants had lost their respective Egyptian nationalities in 1991 and 1993. Accordingly Siag Touristic was, from the time Mr Siag increased his shareholding, a majority foreign-owned company.491 A legal entity was foreign where the majority of share capital is held by foreigners.492 Article 1 of Law No. 15 of 1963 and Desert Land Law No. 143 of 1981 prohibited foreigners from owning \"desert lands\" (which included the land purchased by Siag Touristic).493 In addition, Law 230/96 provided that real property could not be owned by foreigners except for the purpose of residence or for performing approved objectives under the investment law.494 Therefore Siag Touristic, as a foreign entity, was prohibited from owning or leasing the land at Taba.495\n\nIbid., pp. 13.\n\nIbid., pp. 12-13.\n\nIbid., p. 12.\n\nIbid., p. 15.\n\nIbid., p. 14.\n\n386.\n\nEgypt contracted with Siag Touristic on the basis of the Egyptian nationality of its owners. If and when the Claimants lost their respective Egyptian nationalities, it became legally impossible for Egypt to transfer title over the property to Claimants.496 Although Claimants (and therefore Siag Touristic) did satisfy the Egyptian nationality requirement at the time the contract for sale was made, they no longer satisfied that requirement from the moment they lost Egyptian nationality.497 As the title to the land in Taba could not be transferred to Claimants by Egypt (and therefore could not be registered), Claimants had no rights of ownership to assert against Egypt.498 Further, as it was legally impossible (due to the actions of the Claimants) for Egypt to complete the contract, Egypt had been released from any obligation it had to transfer title to the Claimants, and the contract had been rescinded *ipso facto499*\n\nIbid., p. 16.\n\nIbid., p. 17.\n\nIbid., pp. 16-17.\n\nIbid., p. 18.\n\n387.\n\nOn the subject of nationality Egypt submitted that, If the Tribunal should uphold its earlier decision that the Claimants were not Egyptian nationals, the Claimants should nevertheless be estopped from denying their Egyptian nationality in these proceedings.500 Claimants had grossly misled the Egyptian Government by unequivocally stating that they were Egyptian, both when attaining the right to purchase and develop land in Taba and when acquiring their Egyptian passports.501 Estoppel was well-recognised in international law and was based on equity and good faith. Claimants had attained far too much on the basis of their being Egyptian to now state that they were not Egyptian.502\n\nIbid., p. 50.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., p. 51.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply Memorial on the Merits\n---------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nClaimants filed their Reply Memorial on 21 December 2007, together with a further expert opinion of Professor Reisman and a further witness statement of Dr Abou Zeid Fahmy, both of which addressed the merits of the case.503\n\nFurther expert opinions and witness statements were adduced in respect of damages.\n\n389.\n\nIn addition to arguments already made, Claimants submitted that Egypt had not seriously contested its liability in this case. Indeed it had not adduced a single witness of fact.504 The bulk of Egypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial and accompanying witness statements were directed at Claimants\u2019 submissions on damages. The remainder of Egypt\u2019s experts merely re-urged Egypt\u2019s jurisdictional arguments under the rubric of estoppel/opposability.505 It was said that Egypt\u2019s silence had effectively conceded almost all those facts set forth in Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, submissions on damages and witness statements.506 The unchallenged facts of the case essentially established Egypt\u2019s liability *per se* and left to the Tribunal the principal task of fixing compensation.507 In particular, Egypt had failed to respond to Claimants\u2019 assertions that Egypt had twice seized the Taba property by force,508 its claims that the Claimants had asked for and not received full protection,509 and its claims that Egypt had repeatedly Ignored rulings of its own courts (and had accordingly violated the fair and equitable treatment and impairment clauses of the BIT).510\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 3.\n\nIbid., p. 1.\n\nIbid., p. 4.\n\nIbid., p. 1.\n\nIbid., p. 15.\n\nIbid., p. 18.\n\nIbid., pp. 18, 21.\n\n390.\n\nClaimants asserted that Egypt had admitted it had coerced Siag Touristic into cancelling its contract with Lumir. Egypt\u2019s claim that the Lumir contract created a \"security issue\" had not been explained and was not worthy of a response.511\n\nIbid., p. 5.\n\n391.\n\nAs to Egypt\u2019s claim that it had expropriated the Taba property because Siag Touristic was behind schedule, this was difficult to take seriously, for three reasons: first, Egypt\u2019s assertion was contrary to the large amount of unrebutted evidence adduced by Claimants demonstrating the progress made by Siag Touristic and the delays caused by Egypt.512 Siag Touristic had in fact completed much of Phase One and had commenced work on Phase Two ahead of schedule.513 At the time of the expropriation in May 1996 Siag Touristic still had seven months to complete Phase One.514 Secondly, Egypt\u2019s claim ran counter to the explanations Egypt\u2019s lawyers had given in domestic Egyptian litigation, at which time the reason for the expropriation was stated to be Siag Touristic\u2019s arrangement with Lumir, an Israeli company.515 Egypt\u2019s domestic submissions in respect of Lumir hardened over time, and were an admission that Egypt\u2019s seizure of Claimants\u2019 land was the result of bigotry and religious zealotry.516 Thirdly, Egypt\u2019s submissions were at odds with the rulings of Egypt\u2019s own courts, which had ruled at the highest level that the purported cancellation of the contract before the deadline for completion of Phase One had been reached was invalid.517\n\nIbid., p. 6.\n\nIbid., pp. 6-7.\n\nIbid., p. 8.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., pp. 9-10.\n\nIbid., pp. 10-13.\n\n392.\n\nIn respect of the \"public use\" suggestion, Claimants argued that the transfer of the Taba property to the Al-Sharq Gas Company (\"Al Sharq\") was not made to give effect to such a use. The property had been expropriated in 1996 but the first suggestion that the land would be put to public use was in 2002, and the transfer to Al Sharq not until 2003. The property had lain idle for seven years, without it ever being claimed that it would be put to public use.518 There was no reason that Al Sharq had to use the Claimants\u2019 property for its gas pipeline when it had land of its own immediately to the south, and in any event only a small sliver of the property was used by Al Sharq.519\n\nIbid., p. 22.\n\nIbid.\n\n393.\n\nIt was then submitted that Egypt\u2019s argument that Siag Touristic could not legally own the Taba property because the Claimants had lost their Egyptian nationalities was flawed in several ways: first, Egyptian law was irrelevant to the dispute, which was governed by the BIT and international law;520 secondly, the BIT did not restrict the right of Italian nationals to own land in Egypt, indeed the BIT ensured that Italian investors would receive national treatment;521 thirdly, even if Egyptian law were relevant, and the BIT did not confer national treatment upon the Claimants, Siag Touristic was nevertheless permitted to own land under Egyptian Investment Law, which prevailed over Egyptian land ownership laws;522 fourthly, the TDA was able to permit foreigners to own desert lands for touristic purposes;523 fifthly, Egyptian law afforded the right to own property to Arab nationals, including Mr Siag, who was a Lebanese national at all relevant times;524 and lastly, Egypt had not purported to cancel the contract due to alleged land-ownership restrictions, and could not now excuse its prior unlawful behaviour by stating that the same end could have been achieved legally.525\n\nIbid., pp. 25-36.\n\nIbid., pp. 26, 36-39.\n\nIbid., p. 40.\n\nIbid., pp. 40-41.\n\nIbid., pp. 26, 42.\n\nIbid., p. 26.\n\n394.\n\nClaimants submitted that Egypt\u2019s estoppel and opposability arguments were exactly the same arguments that had Egypt run and failed within the jurisdictional phase, albeit dressed up in terms that made the arguments sound appropriate for the merits phase. They did not present any new issue related to the merits and simply sought a \"do over\" on issues of jurisdiction already decided; in particular the issues of effective nationality and \"genuine link.\"526 It was further submitted that there was no basis for the Tribunal to reconsider its Decision on Jurisdiction. The doctrine of *res judicata* called for presumptive finality in respect of the Tribunal\u2019s prior decisions.527\n\nIbid., pp. 43-45.\n\nIbid., p. 45.\n\n395.\n\nIn respect of estoppel Claimants contended that, in order to succeed in its claim, Egypt had to show that Claimants had wilfully misrepresented themselves as Egyptian to the Egyptian authorities.528 Egypt could not do this; it had made the same argument during the jurisdictional phase but had not substantiated its claim. As Claimants had demonstrated during the jurisdictional phase, they had mistakenly believed that they were Egyptian, because that is what they were told by Egyptian officials.529 Further, Egypt\u2019s contention that it had been misled by Claimants bordered on the ludicrous - Egypt must be charged with being able to understand and properly apply its own laws.530\n\nIbid., p. 46.\n\nIbid., p. 47.\n\nIbid.\n\n396.\n\nMoreover, Egypt could not show that it had relied on the Claimants\u2019 representations to its detriment. Being made a respondent in these proceedings did not qualify as a detriment to Egypt.531 Nor could Egypt claim successfully that it had relied on Claimants\u2019 statements as to their nationality, as Claimants\u2019 loss of Egyptian nationality under Egyptian law was readily discernable by the Government.532\n\nIbid., p. 48.\n\nIbid., p. 49.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits\n-------------------------------\n\n397.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the merits was filed on 12 February 2008, together with the further expert opinions of Professors Smit, dated 11 February 2008, and Shearer, dated 21 January 2008. Egypt\u2019s submissions may be summarised as follows:\n\n398.\n\nFirst, the Claimants were estopped from denying their Egyptian nationality. Claimants had mis-stated the requirements of the doctrine of estoppel; it was not necessary for Claimants to have wilfully misrepresented their status as Egyptian nationals; it was sufficient that Egypt relied on Claimants\u2019 representations or that Claimants gained an advantage from those representations.533 In this case, it was clear that Egypt had relied on Claimants\u2019 representations to its detriment, both by remaining in business with the Claimants and by having to defend the present claims.534\n\nIbid., pp. 15-16.\n\nIbid., p. 16.\n\n399.\n\nEgypt accepted that it was aware that the Tribunal had considered the *Nottebohm* case on this matter in the jurisdictional phase.535 However, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention did not exclude the *Nottebohm* doctrine, which may operate to give context to the *lex specialis.536 Nottebohm* was authority for the fundamental concept that, as a matter of international law, a tribunal should not hear cases where its jurisdiction is based on trivial contacts between the claimant and the nation that affords him access to the tribunal.537 Only claimants with *bona fide* links with their state of nationality should be permitted to take advantage of the protections afforded by the BIT.538\n\nIbid.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder, p. 17.\n\nIbid., pp. 17, 19.\n\nIbid., p. 19.\n\n400.\n\nEgypt next submitted that the doctrine of **res judicata** did not apply to preclude Egypt\u2019s estoppel and opposability arguments. The Tribunal had expressly allowed Egypt to present its evidence on estoppel during the merits phase, and Egypt was now doing so.539 An obvious reason for the Tribunal to revisit its Decision on Jurisdiction was that that Decision relied on false and fraudulent evidence in respect of Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality.540 In any event, **res judicata** only applied to fully litigated and finally decided proceedings, not cases such as this where the proceedings continued.541\n\nIbid., p. 20.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., pp. 20-21.\n\n401.\n\nIt was then argued that the BIT and international law did not govern every aspect of this dispute.542 Municipal Egyptian law played an important role, as it established the status of the Claimants and the legal position of what they had invested in.543 In other words, while the BIT and international law determined how an investment may be treated, it was Egyptian law that determined whether the investment was able to be protected at all.544 In this case, Egyptian law said that Siag Touristic was not lawfully able to own the land in Taba as it was majority-owned by foreigners.545\n\nIbid., pp. 25-28.\n\nIbid., pp. 22-23.\n\nIbid., p. 25.\n\nIbid.\n\n402.\n\nEgypt submitted that it could not be blamed for failing to raise at an earlier stage the objection that Siag Touristic was not lawfully permitted to own the Taba land. Mr Siag had for years pretended to be Egyptian and could not now argue that Egypt was at fault for taking so long to \"catch him\".546 It must follow that, if there was no property owned, there were no damages other than what the Claimants had put into the project, which is what Siag Touristic had been offered in settlement by Egypt.547\n\nIbid., p. 28.\n\nIbid., p. 29.\n\n403.\n\nIt was also contended that the doctrine of national treatment did not apply in this case. Article 3 of the BIT applied only to investments after they were made, not before they were made.548\n\nIbid., pp. 29-31.\n\n404.\n\nEgypt then argued that, in addition to being desert land, Taba was within a national security area, wherein foreign ownership was prohibited without authorisation.549 The French company Accor had recently been refused permission to buy into land in Taba, on national security grounds.550 The ability of non-Egyptian Arabs to own land required a Presidential Decree following the approval of Cabinet. Further, the example cited by Claimants related to a different geographical area and was not relevant to Taba.551\n\nIbid., pp. 32-33.\n\nIbid., p. 33.\n\nIbid., pp. 33-35.\n\n405.\n\nEgypt argued that the Investment Law cited by Claimants was also inapplicable, because the Investment Law applied only to companies established under its auspices. Siag Touristic was not formed under the Investment Law but under the Companies Law, which did not offer the same privileges as those granted to Investment Law companies.552\n\nIbid., pp. 35-36.\n\n406.\n\nEgypt\u2019s next submission was that the transfer of title from Siag Touristic to Siag Taba had been invalid as it had not received the approval of the TDA, as required by Article 10 of the contract governing the sale of the Taba land.553 Egypt requested that the Claimants supply evidence of their compliance with the conditions set out in Article 10, failing which those assets transferred to Siag Taba should be excluded.554\n\nIbid., p. 39.\n\nIbid., pp. 39-40.\n\n407.\n\nEgypt asserted that the delays in the Taba project were not caused by the Egyptian authorities but were of Siag Touristic\u2019s own doing.555 Egypt had offered compensation to Claimants for the expropriation, in accordance with the BIT and applicable Egyptian law. That was clear evidence that the expropriation was lawful556 and it was naive to suggest that the land at Taba had been seized so it could be given to friends of the Egyptian President. The Property had been retaken in 1996 yet the Al Sharq Gas Company had not been formed until 2000. Clearly there cannot have been a link between the retaking of the land for lack of performance in 1996 and the transfer to the Al Sharq Gas Company.557\n\nIbid., pp. 40-44.\n\nIbid., pp. 44-50, 55-56.\n\nIbid., p. 54.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Oral Submissions on Liability at the Merits Hearing558\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs noted, the first day of the hearing, 10 March 2008, was set aside to hear oral argument and evidence on Respondent\u2019s \"bankruptcy\" and \"Lebanese nationality\" applications. The remainder of the hearing was given over to Issues of liability and quantum. The same legal teams were In attendance for each party, in respect of the merits, Waguih Siag and Professor Reisman (by video link) gave testimony and were cross-examined.\n\n408.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 oral submissions it was first contended that, contrary to Egypt\u2019s claims, the Claimants had made substantial progress in preparing and developing the Project, as had been independently confirmed by a panel of professors from Cairo University.559 Egypt had not cancelled the contract due to delay; the real reason that the contract was cancelled was that the Claimants were dealing with Lumir, which as an Israeli company, was undesirable in Egypt\u2019s eyes.560 This had been made clear in the submissions of Egypt in domestic litigation against the Claimants.561\n\nT2: 13-19.\n\nT2: 21 - 23, 66.\n\nT2: 23, 39.\n\n409.\n\nMr Siag and Dr Abou Zeid Fahmy (who was lead counsel for Mr Siag, Siag Touristic, and Siag Taba) had each made requests of the Egyptian police for the protection of the Claimants\u2019 investment. Those requests went unheeded. Egypt had accordingly breached Article 4.1 of the BIT, which guaranteed full protection to investments.562\n\nT2: 25 - 27, 45 - 46; T8: 6-7.\n\n410.\n\nClaimants also submitted that Egypt had failed to honour repeated rulings of its courts in favour of Claimants, including rulings of the highest court in Egypt, in clear breach of the fair and equitable treatment standards of the BIT.563 That had not been contested by Egypt.564\n\nT2: 27 - 34, 37 - 38, 41; T8: 5 - 6.\n\nT2: 30, 40.\n\n411.\n\nClaimants argued that the expropriated Siag Touristic Property had laid fallow for seven years before mention was even made that it would be put to public use.565 It was then gifted to the private Al Sharq Gas Company, a company majority owned by a close friend of President Mubarak. That company proceeded to install a pipeline that could have been installed on land already owned by Al Sharq ten to twenty feet away. It was clear that this was not a public purpose.566\n\nT2: 34.\n\nT2: 35 - 36, 38; T8: 3.\n\n412.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 submission there had been at least seven clear acts of illegal expropriation by Egypt, in clear violation of the BIT and international law,567 and other than in respect of expropriation Egypt had failed to offer any response on any of the standards of protection of the BIT.568 Egypt\u2019s silence was telling as to its lack of defence on these issues.569 Egypt had failed to respond on the issue of fair and equitable treatment570 and in Claimants\u2019 submission had effectively conceded that it was liable to Claimants for breach of the full protection standard of the BIT.571 Nor had Egypt offered a defence to Claimants\u2019 assertions of breach of the impairment clause of the BIT.572 Egypt had essentially conceded liability.573\n\nT2: 40; T8: 1, 3.\n\nT2: 30, 44; T8: 8.\n\nT2: 44.\n\nIbid.\n\nT2: 45 - 46.\n\nT2: 46.\n\nT2: 65; T8: 7.\n\n413.\n\nFinally, Claimants argued that Egypt\u2019s submission that the provisions of its domestic land laws meant that there could not have been an illegal expropriation was incorrect. It was a fundamental principle of international law that a party could not invoke its domestic laws to excuse its failure to perform a treaty.574 Egypt had never before raised this defence during 12 years of litigation. Egypt could not now say that it could have achieved its ends legally although it did not do so.575 Further, Egypt knew or should have known that the Claimants lost Egyptian nationality in 1990 and 1993 by operation of Egypt\u2019s own nationality law.576 Egypt\u2019s courts had made repeated rulings affirming the Claimants as rightful owners of the Taba property after the Claimants had lost Egyptian nationality.577\n\nT2: 46-48; T8: 8-12.\n\nT8: 12.\n\nT8: 10-11.\n\nT8: 13-14.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Oral Submissions on Liability\n-------------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nEgypt\u2019s submissions on liability were, first, that Mr Siag, as the Tribunal had held, was not an Egyptian national. He therefore was not permitted to be the major shareholder (as he was) in the Taba Project, as the land in question could not, under Egyptian law, be owned by foreigners.578\n\nT2: 75 - 77; T8: 49.\n\n415.\n\nEgypt then asserted that the Taba project had been behind schedule, and the likelihood of it being completed on time was very slim.579 The delay in progress was caused by poor management, not Egyptian authorities.580\n\nT2: 76, 81.\n\nT2: 81.\n\n416.\n\nContrary to Dr Abou Zeid Fahmy\u2019s written submission, Egyptian Investment laws did not prevail over Egypt\u2019s foreign ownership laws. Egypt\u2019s foreign ownership laws could not be subordinated.581\n\nT2: 78.\n\n417.\n\nEgypt submitted that its taking of the land was lawful. There was no evidence that it was discriminatory, and compensation was being determined.582 In addition, the land was now being used for a major gas pipeline. There was no question but that that was a public purpose. Al Sharq was a publicly owned company.583\n\nT2: 84, 86 - 87.\n\nT2: 84 - 86.\n\n418.\n\nThe *Nottebohm* doctrine was applicable to, and would be run in, the merits phase.584 Mr Siag had no genuine link with Italy, his State of nationality.585 Whether he knew he was Egyptian or not Mr Siag was estopped from denying his Egyptian nationality because he had used that nationality to obtain his Egyptian passport and to conclude contracts with Egyptian officials.586\n\nT2: 87; T8: 54.\n\nT8: 54.\n\nT2: 87 - 88; T8: 51 - 52.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-hearing Submissions\n-----------------------------------\n\n419.\n\nThe parties presented their respective post-hearing submissions on 24 April 2008. To a large degree the parties re-iterated their previous submissions on liability.\n\n420.\n\nThe Claimants emphasised their submission that Egypt understood that its liability was a foregone conclusion. It had not presented a single fact witness or challenged any of the main events of the dispute.587 Egypt had carried out seven illegal acts of expropriation.588 The reality was that the first of these, Resolution No. 83, was the effective expropriation as Claimants had not regained ownership of the property or project since then.589\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, p. 21.\n\nIbid., pp. 22-24.\n\nIbid., p. 25.\n\n421.\n\nClaimants also emphasised that Egypt had failed to provide full protection to Claimants\u2019 investment,590 had failed to treat Claimants\u2019 investments fairly and equitably,591 and had breached the BIT\u2019S fair and equitable treatment provision in many ways.592\n\nIbid., pp. 25-27.\n\nIbid., pp. 27-28,\n\nIbid., p. 28.\n\n422.\n\nClaimants asserted that Egypt could not excuse its unlawful actions by claiming that it could have acted legally by invoking its domestic land laws.593 Egypt had cited no principle of international law that would retroactively excuse a state\u2019s unlawful conduct.594 In the present case Egypt\u2019s claim was even less persuasive, as it was asking the Tribunal to excuse its misconduct because it overlooked its own laws. If Egypt had wanted to argue that Siag was not entitled to own the Property it had every opportunity to do so when the issue was being litigated in the Egyptian courts.595 Moreover, Egypt could not use its domestic law to excuse its liability for a breach of international law.596\n\nIbid., p. 29.\n\nIbid., p. 30.\n\nIbid., p. 32.\n\nIbid., pp. 30-32.\n\n423.\n\nLastly, it was submitted that, despite the new labels of \"estoppel\" and \"opposability\", Egypt was in fact asking the Tribunal to reconsider its ruling on effective nationality. That issue had already been determined by the Tribunal.597 Further, Egypt\u2019s submissions that the Claimants lacked genuine links to Italy were incorrect, as the Tribunal had confirmed.598 Claimants did not intentionally misrepresent themselves as being Egyptian; that was their honest belief.599 Egypt could not claim estoppel based on ignorance of its own municipal law,600 and in no meaningful sense did Egypt suffer detriment by reason of these proceedings.601\n\nIbid., p. 33.\n\nIbid., pp. 33-34.\n\nIbid., p. 34.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., p. 35.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Post-hearing Submissions\n--------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions re-iterated its earlier submissions. In particular Egypt emphasised that Mr Siag had relied on his Egyptian nationality to obtain Egyptian passports and to conclude, on preferential terms, contracts with Egyptian authorities. He was estopped from now denying his Egyptian nationality.602 Even if Mr Siag believed himself to be Egyptian at the times when he held himself out to be so, such subjective good faith was irrelevant to estoppel. What was required was objective good faith - fairness in the situation.603\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, pp. 2-5.\n\nIbid., p. 5.\n\n425.\n\nEgypt also emphasised its submission that, under the *Nottebohm* rule, Egypt need not recognise Mr Siag\u2019s claim. Mr Siag could not rely on his Italian nationality when he had no genuine link with Italy.604 Nor could Claimants oppose their Italian nationality against Egypt, with which they did possess genuine links.605 Egypt\u2019s invocation of the **Nottebohm** doctrine was not precluded by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, because **Nottebohm** was a matter for consideration in the merits phase.606\n\nIbid., pp. 6-7.\n\nIbid., p. 7.\n\nIbid., p. 6.\n\n426.\n\nEgypt argued that it had done nothing in violation of international law. Rather, Siag Touristic had missed many deadlines and was behind in completion of the first phase of construction.607\n\nIbid., p. 21.\n\n**Discussion on Liability**\n---------------------------\n\nExpropriation\n-------------\n\n427.\n\nThat the Claimants\u2019 investment was expropriated does not appear to be contested. Egypt itself refers to the taking as \"expropriation\".608 The Claimants submit that the expropriation was both direct and indirect. That submission has not been disputed by Egypt. Direct expropriation occurs when the title of the owner is affected by the measure in question.609 In the present case Egypt, commencing with Resolution No. 83, formally transferred ownership of the land in Taba from Siag Touristic (and hence the Claimants) to the Government. Indirect expropriation occurs when a party\u2019s utilisation of its investment is removed without title being affected.610 The Tribunal finds that Claimants\u2019 investment was directly expropriated by Egypt.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter Memorial on the Merits, p. 8; Egypt\u2019s Rejoinder, p. 44; Egypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, p. 42.\n\nDolzer & Schreuer, *supra,* note 166, p. 92.\n\nIbid.\n\n428.\n\nHowever, expropriation in and of itself is not an illegitimate act. It is well-accepted that a State has the right to expropriate foreign-owned property.611 It is equally well accepted, however, that an expropriation is only lawful if certain conditions are met. Several of these requirements have become part of customary international law.612 They are also included to varying degrees in most treaties, including the BIT governing this arbitration. Article 5(1) of the Italy-Egypt BIT states as follows:\n\n\"NATIONALIZATION OR EXPROPRIATION\n\n(ii) Investments of either Contracting State or any of its natural or juridical persons shall not be directly or indirectly nationalized, expropriated, or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation, in the territory and maritime zones of [s/c] either Contracting State, except for a public purpose in the national interest of that State, for adequate and fair compensation, according to legal procedures and on condition that such measures are taken on a non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with due process of law.\"\n\nThe plain effect of Article 5(1)(ii) of the BIT is that an expropriation is unlawful unless the qualifying conditions are satisfied. Dolzer & Schreuer state that the preconditions of a legal expropriation \"must be fulfilled cumulatively.\"613 Claimants submit in the particular case of the Italy-Egypt BIT that \"The terms of Article 5(1)(ii) plainly require each of the listed requirements to be complied with in order for an expropriation to be deemed legal.\" [emphasis in original]614 The Tribunal shares that view; the clear wording of Article 5(1)(ii) is that all conditions must be met lest an expropriation be deemed unlawful. The Tribunal will now examine whether all the conditions have been satisfied.\n\nIbid., p. 89; *See also,* Shaw, International Law (5th ed., 2003), p. 738.\n\nDolzer & Schreuer, *supra* note 166, p. 91.\n\nIbid.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, p. 76.\n\n*i) Public Purpose in the National Interest of the State*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n429.\n\nEgypt has submitted that, as the Al Sharq Gas Company, which now has ownership of the land in Taba, had used the land to construct a major pipeline to transport gas to Jordan, \"there can\u2019t be any question but that this is a public purpose, what the land is being used for.\"615 Claimants submit that the pipeline could as easily have been built on nearby land already owned by Al Sharq, and that the pipeline used but a fraction of what was Claimants\u2019 land.616\n\nT2: 84 - 85.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 22.\n\n430.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the fact that the pipeline could have been built elsewhere does not of itself demonstrate that Claimants\u2019 land was not expropriated for a public use. There were conflicting views as to whether Al Sharq was a private or public company and no direct evidence was presented, which places the Tribunal in a position of some difficulty. The Tribunal accepts the assurance of Mr Newman, counsel for Egypt (in response to direct questioning) that Al Sharq is a publicly owned company.617\n\nT2: 85.\n\n431.\n\nThat assurance is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of Article 5 of the BIT that the expropriation is \"for a public purpose\". The wording of Article 5 requires that the public purpose was the reason the investment was expropriated. The Tribunal does not consider such to be the case. The Claimants\u2019 investment was expropriated in 1996 by Ministerial Resolution No. 83. The reason for the expropriation was stated therein to be \"the failure of the Touristic Investment and Hotel Management Company \"Siag\" to honor its commitments stipulated in the mentioned contract on time.\"618 No mention was made of the land being needed for, or the intention to use it for, a public purpose. Ministerial Resolution No. 279 of 2001 similarly failed to note a public use motivation for cancelling the contract.619 Nor was mention of a public use made by Egypt\u2019s lawyers in any of the numerous court appearances in respect of the taking of Claimants\u2019 land. It was not until Presidential Decree No. 205 was passed down in 2002 that Egypt stated that the land would be allocated for the public benefit.620\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 39.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 51.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 57.\n\n432.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept that because an investment was eventually put to public use, the expropriation of that investment must necessarily be said to have been \"for\" a public purpose. In the present case it is clear that the Claimants\u2019 land was not expropriated for particular assignation to Al Sharq, because the expropriation took place in 1996 and Al Sharq was not constituted until 2000.621 That does not, of course, mean that the land could not in theory have been taken for another, or an as-yet-unnamed, public purpose. However, there is no evidence to support that proposition. Nor indeed is that thesis advanced by Egypt, which focussed on Al Sharq as evidencing public use. Claimants\u2019 land lay unused between 1996 and 2003. There were six years between expropriation and the first indication that a public use was intended. The Tribunal finds on the evidence that in the present circumstances, Claimants\u2019 land was not expropriated \"for a public purpose.\"\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder p. 54.\n\n433.\n\nEgypt has therefore failed to satisfy the \"public purpose\" limb of Article 5 of the BIT. As the conditions of expropriation set out in Article 5 are cumulative, failure on one is failure overall. For the sake of completeness the Tribunal will nevertheless examine the remaining conditions of Article 5.\n\n*ii) Adequate and Fair Compensation*\n------------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nClaimants submitted,622 and Egypt did not contest, that no compensation has been paid to Claimants to date. However, Egypt noted that the Explanatory Memorandum to Prime Ministerial Decree No. 799 explicitly stated that adequate compensation would be paid to Claimants. Egypt at the hearing further noted that the issue of compensation was currently before the Egyptian courts and would be resolved.623 Claimants have not denied that the matter is before the Egyptian courts, but of course they are not pursuing the matter in that forum. They have elected to pursue their Treaty claim as they are entitled to do under the BIT. It must also be noted that Claimants\u2019 investment was expropriated in 1996, some 12 years ago. Dolzer and Schreuer state that under customary international law and \"most treaties\", compensation must not only be adequate, it must also be promptly paid.624 Although the Italy - Egypt BIT does not expressly employ the word \"prompt\" (simply stating that compensation paid must be \"adequate and fair\"), the Tribunal considers that the absence of that word ought not to be seen to permit Egypt to refrain from paying compensation indefinitely.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, pp. 83 - 85.\n\nT2: 84.\n\nDolzer & Schreuer, *supra* n 166, p. 91.\n\n435.\n\nEven the most charitable of impartial observers would not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, contend that a 12-year delay (at the least) was \"prompt.\" The Tribunal finds on all the evidence that Egypt has not paid \"adequate and fair\" compensation to the Claimants.\n\n*iii) According to Legal Procedures*\n------------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nIn a technical sense it could perhaps be said that Resolution 83 effecting the 1996 expropriation was a \"legal procedure\", but Resolution No. 83 was subsequently enjoined by both the Cairo and Supreme Administrative Courts,625 and was cancelled by the Supreme Administrative Court in 2001.626 Despite the enjoining and subsequent cancellation of Resolution 83 the Property was not returned to Claimants, save for one 36-hour period. The Tribunal finds that the effective expropriation of 1996 (in the sense that the Claimants have not since possessed the land at Taba) was not carried out according to legal procedures.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibits 45 and 49.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 50.\n\n437.\n\nOne could possibly argue that Prime Ministerial Resolution No. 799, not having been cancelled, was a legitimate legal procedure, but in context that argument fails to appeal since the many resolutions and decrees overturned prior to Resolution No. 799, without return to the Claimants of their investment, provides convincing evidence that Egypt has not followed proper legal procedures in expropriating Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n*iv) A Non-discriminatory Basis*\n--------------------------------\n\n438.\n\nEgypt has submitted that there is no evidence that the expropriation was discriminatory.627 Claimants respond that other foreign-owned hotels in the Taba area such as the Hilton, Sofitel, Marriott, and Hyatt, have not been expropriated.628\n\nT2: 84.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, p. 125.\n\n439.\n\nThere is a scarcity of evidence on both sides of this issue. The Tribunal notes that Ministerial Resolution No. 279629 purported to cancel the contracts entered into with both Siag Touristic (dated 2 January 1989) and the \"Nile Valley Hotel Company\" (dated 4 January 1989). However, very little if any evidence was offered in elucidation of Nile Valley\u2019s circumstances. The Tribunal is not aware, for instance, whether the Nile Valley Hotel Company was a foreign or local investment. Of course, even assuming that the Nile Valley was foreign owned, the expropriation of two foreign-owned investments may constitute discrimination as much as the expropriation of a single investment. It depends on the specific circumstances, of which there is little in the way of evidence. As to discriminatory intent, the Tribunal first notes that there is some difference of opinion as to whether such intent is necessary to show discrimination, or whether a discriminatory effect will suffice.630 In any event it is clear that a discriminatory effect must be shown, and the Tribunal does not consider that it has sufficient evidence before it to determine that issue.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 51.\n\nDolzer & Schreuer, *supra* note 166, p. 177.\n\n*v) Due Process of Law*\n-----------------------\n\n440.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Claimants\u2019 submission, citing *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,631* that due process may be denied both substantively and procedurally. Egypt has not submitted to the contrary.\n\nICSID Case ARB/97/3, Award of 21 November 2000.\n\n441.\n\nIn terms of substantive abuse, Claimants submit that Resolution No. 83 expropriated Claimants\u2019 investment on the stated grounds that Siag Touristic had failed to meet its contractual obligations. That view is supported by the wording of Resolution No. 83, which refers to a failure by Siag Touristic to honour commitments \"on time,\" and by Egypt\u2019s submission that the land was retaken \"for lack of performance in 1996.\"632 Claimants\u2019 alleged failure to meet their contractual commitments, namely falling behind the agreed schedule for completion of the project, was the explanation for the taking of the land argued most vigorously by Egypt in this arbitration. In discussing the way in which he land was taken Egypt submitted that \"the rate at which the project was being implemented was so slow that it could not possibly have been completed by the end of 1996.\"633 Claimants for their part submit that the project was on track and would have been completed on time.634 The Tribunal accepts that there were delays to the Project, but it does not accept that those delays provided a valid reason to cancel the contract and expropriate the Claimants\u2019 investment. It is not in dispute that Siag Touristic had until the end of 2006 to complete \"Phase One\" of the project. Resolution No. 83 was passed on 23 May 2006, some seven months before deadline. The Tribunal does not consider that the Claimants were afforded due process by Egypt\u2019s early cancellation. It is important to note that the Supreme Administrative Court of Egypt held the same view. It ruled that the decision to issue Resolution No. 83 before the specified date was \"without any legal basis, in all respects.\"635 The Tribunal finds that Claimants accordingly suffered a denial of substantive due process.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder, p. 54.\n\nT2: 81.\n\nT2: 13-19.\n\nJudgment of 7 August 2001 (Claimants\u2019 Exhibit 50).\n\n442.\n\nIn respect of procedural abuse, Claimants base their submissions on the fact that Resolution No. 83 was passed without prior notice to Claimants.636 Egypt has not contested this submission. The Tribunal accepts Claimants\u2019 submission and finds that, as occupiers of the land the subject of Resolution No. 83 and as Italian investors protected by the BIT they ought to have received notice that the TDA was considering expropriating the investment. Claimants received no such notice and were not afforded the opportunity, until after the fact, to be heard on the matter. The Tribunal finds that the failure by Egypt to provide such notice constitutes a denial of due process in terms of Article 5 of the BIT.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, pp. 25 - 26, 83.\n\n443.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal finds that the evidence is overwhelming that Egypt has failed to meet the five cumulative conditions required for lawful expropriation set down by Article 5(1)(ii) of the BIT. Egypt\u2019s expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment is held to have been in contravention of Article 5(1)(ii).\n\n444.\n\nThe Tribunal further accepts Claimants\u2019 submission637 that, as the Tribunal has found that a breach of Article 5(1)(ii) has taken place, it need not examine the auxiliary claim that Egypt also breached the terms of Article 5(1)(i) of the BIT.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, p. 86.\n\nFailure to Provide Full Protection\n----------------------------------\n\n445.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the BIT provides that: \"Investments by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n446.\n\nClaimants have provided detailed submissions and evidence that, upon learning that Resolution No. 83 was about to be implemented and Claimants\u2019 investment seized, both Mr Siag and Dr Abou Zeid Fahmy made explicit requests of the Nuweibaa Police that Claimants\u2019 investment be protected. By way of example, Mr Siag gave evidence that: \"Dr Abou Zeid and I specifically requested the protection of the police to safeguard my rights and to keep the Property and the Project in Siag\u2019s possession.\"638 Dr Abou Zeid stated that \"I specifically demanded the protection of the police and of the General Prosecutor in order to safeguard Siag\u2019s rights....\"639 The requests for protection of Mr Siag and Dr Abou Zeid are recorded in verbatim transcripts made by the Nuweibaa Police and the El Tor district attorney\u2019s office on June 3-4 1996. Egypt has not denied that the asserted requests for protection were made. Indeed Egypt, as Claimants noted, has not addressed Claimants\u2019 evidence in this regard at all. Absent any evidence to the contrary the Tribunal accepts without reservation Claimants\u2019 evidence and finds that these requests for protection occurred.\n\nWitness statement of Waguih Siag of 8 May 2006.\n\nWitness statement of Dr Mustafa Abou Zeid Fahmy of 2 May 2006.\n\n447.\n\nThe standard of protection expected of a host state is not absolute. It has been stated that a host state must exercise \"due diligence\" in preventing harm to an investment.640 In the present case Claimants investment was expropriated by force and in opposition to explicit pleas for protection. The Egyptian courts on several subsequent occasions cancelled the Resolutions or decrees that purported to give legitimacy to the expropriation, yet Claimants\u2019 investment has not been returned to them in the 12 years following expropriation. The Tribunal notes in this respect the decision in the *Wena Hotels641* case, wherein the seized investments were returned to Claimants after a year, yet the Tribunal in that case ruled that the full protection clause of the relevant BIT had been breached.\n\nDolzer & Schreuer, *supra* note 166, pp. 149 - 150.\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award of 8 December 2000.\n\n448.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the conduct of Egypt fell well below the standard of protection that the Claimants could reasonably have expected, both in allowing the expropriation to occur and in subsequently failing to take steps to return the investment to Claimants following repeated rulings of Egypt\u2019s own courts that the expropriation was illegal. This is indeed the most egregious element in the whole affair. Accordingly the Tribunal finds that Egypt has contravened Article 4(1) of the Italy-Egypt BIT.\n\nFair and Equitable Treatment\n----------------------------\n\n449.\n\nThis standard of protection is set out in Article 2(2) of the BIT, which reads: \"Each Contracting State shall at all times ensure fair and equitable treatment to the investments of investors of the other Contracting State.\"\n\n450.\n\nThe fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") standard is broad requirement, the application of which depends on the particular facts of each case. It is however widely recognised that the principle of good faith underlies fair and equitable treatment.642 Numerous arbitral tribunals have held that, in international investment arbitration, the host State\u2019s duty to respect the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations arises from its more general duty to act in good faith towards foreigners.643 The general, if not cardinal, principle of customary international law that States must act in good faith is thus a useful yardstick by which to measure the Fair and Equitable standard. While its precise ambit is not easily articulated, a number of categories of frequent application may be observed from past cases. These include such notions as transparency, protection of legitimate expectations, due process, freedom from discrimination and freedom from coercion and harassment.644 Claimants submit that Egypt has violated each of the generally recognised \"strands\" of the fair and equitable treatment doctrine and the Tribunal upholds this contention.645\n\n*Siemens A.G. v. the Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award of 6 February 2007; *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. the United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award of 29 May 2003; *Azurix Corp v. the Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award of 14 July 2006.\n\nIbid.; *Metalclad Corporation v. the United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award of 30 August 2000.\n\nDolzer & Schreuer, *supra* note 166, pp. 133 - 147.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, p. 97.\n\n*i) Lack of Due Process/Denial of Justice*\n------------------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nThis is the application of the FET standard most forcefully pursued by Claimants as having been breached. While maintaining that Egypt had also breached the FET standard in several other ways, it is the contended lack of due process and ensuing denial of justice that is relied on most strongly by Claimants.646\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, pp. 27 -28.\n\n452.\n\nThe concepts of \"due process\" and \"denial of justice\" are closely linked. A failure to allow a party due process will often result in a denial of justice. The United States Model BIT of 2004 states that FET includes \"the obligation not to deny justice...in accordance with the principles of due process...,\"647 The Claimants have addressed the two concepts simultaneously in their submissions.648\n\nUS Model BIT of 2004, Article 5(2)(a).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, pp. 103 - 105.\n\n453.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined, in examining Egypt\u2019s expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment, that the manner of Egypt\u2019s expropriation did not satisfy the requirement of due process. Claimants, in their post-hearing submissions, submit that Egypt\u2019s failure to respect the numerous rulings of its courts in favour of Claimants constituted an \"extraordinary violation of the rule of law\" and \"a twelve-year denial of justice,\" which provided further evidence that the FET standard of the BIT had not been met.649 In contrast, Egypt submitted that the fact it had made an offer of compensation to Siag Touristic was \"clear evidence that Egypt respected the court judgments that recognised that Siag Touristic has certain rights in the project.\"650\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, p. 28.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder, p. 45.\n\n454.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants\u2019 characterisation of Egypt\u2019s conduct and rejects Egypt\u2019s submission, for two principal reasons. First, while it is not in dispute that Egypt offered the Claimants compensation for the loss of their investment, or at least that compensation was discussed by the parties, those discussions took place in November 2003,651 some seven-and-a-half years after the issuance of Resolution 83 and the expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment. There were many judicial rulings in Claimants\u2019 favour in the intervening period, commencing with the Cairo Administrative Court\u2019s enjoining of Resolution No. 83 on 21 July 1996.652 Claimants\u2019 evidence, which is a matter of public record and which has not been contested, is that there were no fewer than eight rulings in Claimants\u2019 favour between the date that Resolution No. 83 was issued and the date that the parties met, at Egypt\u2019s invitation, to discuss compensation.653 The Tribunal does not see that the failure to comply with numerous judicial rulings can be ameliorated by the inconclusive discussion of compensation for expropriation some seven years after the expropriation took place. Secondly, the rulings of the Egyptian courts in Claimants\u2019 favour did not legitimise the seizure of Claimants\u2019 investment or the documents that purportedly authorised that seizure. Nor, plainly, did those rulings require compensation to be paid in return for the expropriation. To the contrary, the rulings flatly rejected Resolution No. 83 and its successors, and ordered that the contract be respected. Among the rulings in Claimants\u2019 favour was that of the South Sinai Civil Appeals Circuit Court ordering the return of the Property to Siag Touristic.654 The Tribunal considers that Egypt\u2019s submission that it respected the rulings of its courts is wholly unsupported by the evidence.\n\nIbid. p. 50.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 45.\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, pp. 27 - 28.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 64.\n\n455.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that Egypt\u2019s actions failed to afford the Claimants due process of law. The Tribunal further considers that the failure to provide due process constituted an egregious denial of justice to Claimants, and a contravention of Article 2(2) of the BIT, in that Egypt failed to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n456.\n\nHaving determined that there has been a breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT on the grounds discussed above the Tribunal need not consider the further grounds submitted by Claimants.\n\nUnreasonable or Discriminatory Measures\n---------------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nThis standard of protection is also set out in Article 2(2) of the BIT, which provides that: \"Each Contracting State shall ensure that the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory and maritime zones of investors of the other Contracting State shall not be in any way subjected to, or impaired by, unreasonable or discriminatory measures.\" Claimants submit that this provision of Article 2(2) is disjunctive, in that measures that are unreasonable or discriminatory will found a claim that the Article has been contravened. That proposition has not been disputed by Egypt and is accepted by the Tribunal. It accords with the clear wording of Article 2(2).\n\n458.\n\nIt cannot be denied that the \"management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal\" of Claimants\u2019 investment has been affected by Egypt\u2019s expropriation. Claimants no longer have possession of, or access to, the land upon which they were developing their project. That of course does not constitute a breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT unless it was precipitated by unreasonable or discriminatory measures.\n\n459.\n\nClaimants submit that the measures taken by Egypt were both unreasonable and discriminatory. The Tribunal has already discussed Claimants\u2019 allegations of discrimination,655 and determined that the evidence on record is insufficient to prove discrimination. However, the Tribunal upholds Claimants\u2019 submission that the measures employed by Egypt during this dispute were unreasonable. The Tribunal has no hesitation in finding that many of the measures taken by Egypt in the course of this dispute were unreasonable in the ordinary meaning of that term. By way of non-exhaustive example, Egypt expropriated Claimants\u2019 investment in May 1996 on the purported grounds that Siag Touristic had not met its construction deadlines when those deadlines had in fact not arrived; in June 1996 Egypt seized control of Claimants\u2019 investment on the back of Resolution No. 83 at a time when Claimants\u2019 application to enjoin Resolution No. 83 was pending; it re-took Claimants\u2019 investment in August 1996 despite the fact that Resolution No. 83 had been enjoined by the Cairo Administrative Court; and it failed to comply with the several judicial rulings invalidating Resolution No. 83 and its successor. Any one of those actions would constitute unreasonable behaviour; viewed *in toto* the matter is beyond question.\n\n*See* paras. 438 - 439 above.\n\n460.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that Egypt has breached Article 2(2) of the Italy -Egypt BIT by subjecting or impairing Claimants\u2019 investment to unreasonable measures.\n\nMost Favoured Nation Treatment\n------------------------------\n\n461.\n\nMost favoured nation treatment is accorded to Italian and Egyptian investors by operation of Article 3 of the BIT. In this case, Claimants invoke the provisions of Article 3 in order to import from the BIT concluded between Egypt and Greece a so-called \"umbrella clause,\" i.e. an obligation on Egypt to \"observe any other obligation it may have entered into, with regard to investments of the other Contracting Party.\"656\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, pp. 127 - 128 (citing Article 2(5) of the Egypt - Greece BIT).\n\n462.\n\nClaimants submit that the obligations breached by Egypt were: those imposed by municipal Egyptian law, namely Articles 34 and 36 of the Egyptian Constitution, Law No. 10 of 1990 and Law No. 230 of 1989; the obligation to respect the rulings of the Egyptian judiciary; and the wrongful termination of the contract.657\n\nIbid. p. 130.\n\n463.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the obligations referred to by Claimants are adequately protected by the BIT. The municipal laws referenced prohibit nationalisation or expropriation other than on terms not dissimilar (although perhaps less strict) to Article 5(1)(ii) of the BIT. For instance Article 34 of the Egyptian Constitution prohibits expropriation \"except for the general good and against a fair compensation as defined by law.\"658 The obligation to respect the rulings of the Egyptian judiciary has been discussed and applied in relation to the Fair and Equitable Treatment and \"unreasonable measures\" standards protected by Article 2(2) of the BIT. Egypt\u2019s wrongful termination of the contract has been discussed and ruled upon in both the expropriation and Fair and Equitable Treatment contexts.\n\nCited in witness statement of Dr Abou Zeid Fahmy of 2 May 2006, p. 13; available at http://www.egypt.gov.eg/english/laws/Constitution/chp\\_two/part\\_two.asp\n\n464.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s rulings in Claimants\u2019 favour on both expropriation and fair and equitable treatment, the Tribunal considers that nothing would be added to Claimants\u2019 claim by the invocation of the most favoured nation doctrine and the \"umbrella clause\" of the Egypt - Greece BIT.\n\nSummary of Findings on Liability\n--------------------------------\n\n465.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the evidence clearly establishes that Egypt has unlawfully expropriated Claimants\u2019 investment, in breach of Article 5(1)(ii) of the BIT; that Egypt failed to provide full protection to Claimants\u2019 investment, in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT; that Egypt failed to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of Claimants\u2019 investment, in breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT; and that Egypt allowed Claimants\u2019 investment to be subjected to unreasonable measures, in breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT.\n\n466.\n\nEgypt is accordingly *prima facie* liable to the Claimants for each of Egypt\u2019s breaches of the BIT. The Tribunal now considers Egypt\u2019s defences to liability.\n\n**Defences to Liability**\n-------------------------\n\n467.\n\nEgypt\u2019s proffered defences to Claimants\u2019 case were: first, that Egypt need not recognise Claimants\u2019 Italian nationalities because Claimants did not possess genuine links to Italy; secondly, that Claimants may not \"oppose\" their Italian nationalities to Egypt; thirdly, that Claimants are estopped from denying their Egyptian nationalities; and fourthly, that Claimants, as foreign nationals, were not permitted to own land in Taba. Each will now be examined.\n\nClaimants Do Not Have Genuine Links to Italy\n--------------------------------------------\n\n468.\n\nThis argument was promulgated most vigorously by Professor Smit. He stated in his October 2007 opinion that the Tribunal, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, had improperly disregarded the *Nottebohm659* doctrine, the application of which entitled Egypt not to recognise Claimants\u2019 Italian nationalities due to the lack of connections Claimants had with Italy.660 Professor Smit in effect stated that, had the Tribunal paid proper regard to *Nottebohm,* it would (or should) have ruled that it had no jurisdiction.661 Professor Smit asserted that, as the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction had been shown to be erroneous, the Tribunal could and should correct that decision, which, as an interlocutory ruling, could be revisited.662 Reflecting the opinion of Professor Smit, Egypt submitted that it was not too late for the Tribunal to revisit its decision on jurisdiction, given the Tribunal\u2019s error in not dealing with \"the clear import\" of *Nottebohm663*\n\n*Liechtenstein v Guatemala,* [1955] ICJ 4.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Smit of 11 October 2007, pp. 11, 24 - 25.\n\nIbid., p. 21.\n\nIbid., p. 32.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, p. 48.\n\n469.\n\nIt is clear from the above that Egypt was, at that fairly late stage of the proceedings, urging the Tribunal to revisit jurisdiction through what Egypt deemed a proper application of *Nottebohm.* It is unclear whether Egypt maintained that submission. Certainly Egypt remained true to its admonition that the Tribunal should revisit jurisdiction on the grounds that Mr Siag\u2019s Lebanese nationality was invalid. That issue has been ruled on. It is less clear whether Egypt continued to urge a revision of the jurisdiction decision under **Nottebohm** on lack of recognition grounds. In its post-hearing submissions Egypt stated categorically that **Nottebohm** \"embodies substantial international law. It does not seek to affect the nationality of a party under national law. Rather, it stands for the proposition that the nationality under which a claimant brings his claim cannot be opposed to the state with which the claimant has real and genuine links.\"664\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, p. 7.\n\n470.\n\nThe Tribunal is not clear how, if **Nottebohm** does not affect a party\u2019s nationality under national law, it can be claimed that any application of **Nottebohm** would affect jurisdiction and require the re-opening of the Tribunal\u2019s decision thereon. Plainly the ***Nottebohm*** doctrine, as relied upon by Egypt, does not relate to any of the other requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, such as consent in writing or consent by a constituent subdivision. If ***Nottebohm*** applied to jurisdiction in any sense the Tribunal considers that it would be in relation to Article 25(2). However, Egypt has strongly submitted that that is not the case and that ***Nottebohm*** is for the merits.\n\n471.\n\nIn the circumstances it would appear that Egypt\u2019s request that the Tribunal revisit its Decision on Jurisdiction on **Nottebohm** grounds may have been implicitly abandoned in favour of examination as part of the merits of the case. That view accords with Professor Smit\u2019s statement that \"At this stage, it suffices if the Tribunal properly applies *[Nottebohm]* to the merits.\"665 However, as Egypt has not explicitly withdrawn its request in respect of jurisdiction, the Tribunal will examine **Nottebohm** as it applies to both jurisdiction and to the merits.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Smit of11 February 2008, p. 15.\n\n472.\n\nProfessor Smit stated that *Nottebohm* was authority for the proposition that \"a state is free to disregard a nationality bestowed on a person on an internationally inadequate ground.\"666 He further stated that Egypt need not recognise Claimants\u2019 Italian nationalities because the Claimants had insufficient links to Italy.667\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Smit of 11 October 2007, p. 11.\n\nIbid., pp. 24-25.\n\n473.\n\nThe Tribunal will first examine Egypt\u2019s submissions in the jurisdictional context. The Tribunal found in its April 2007 Decision on Jurisdiction that there was no room in ICSID proceedings for a test of effective nationality in an assessment of jurisdiction, such being exclusively governed by provisions of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.668 The Tribunal further found that, in any event, the Claimants possessed genuine links to Italy.669 Egypt now urges the reconsideration of those findings. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the only valid reason to revisit its determination on jurisdiction would be if new evidence had been presented by Egypt that conclusively demonstrated a lack of connection between the Claimants and Italy, or presented a principled basis upon which to incorporate a test of effective nationality into an ICSID jurisdiction enquiry. The Tribunal does not consider that such has been adduced by Egypt. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Egypt is asking the Tribunal to alter its finding on jurisdiction on substantially the same evidence as was earlier rejected. The Tribunal refuses to uphold that request. The Tribunal finds that it did not err in ruling that there was no room for a test of effective nationality in terms of ICSID jurisdiction, or in ruling that Claimants possessed genuine links to Italy. The Tribunal affirms its determination of 11 April 2007. Egypt\u2019s claim to the contrary is rejected.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, pp. 55 - 56.\n\nIbid., p. 57.\n\n474.\n\nThe disposition of this matter in the merits context is subject to considerations similar to those relevant in the jurisdictional context. Although presented in the merits phase of the arbitration, Egypt\u2019s claim remains premised upon an alleged lack of genuine link between the Claimants and Italy. The question asked of the Tribunal is the same as was asked in the jurisdictional phase. It would be wrong in the Tribunal\u2019s view to find that the answer to a question posed in the jurisdictional phase did not apply to the very same question simply because the question was now being asked in the merits phase. The opinion of Professor Reisman, that \"[i]n substance, the Tribunal has already ruled on this precise objection\"670 is shared by the Tribunal. Indeed Professor Shearer, an international law expert called by Egypt, appears to take a similar view. He stated that the \"genuine link\" approach to *Nottebohm* had led to a \"close scrutiny of the claimants\u2019 links with Italy\" and that \"attention should turn now to the links of the applicants with Egypt, and away from challenging their Italian nationality.\"671 The Tribunal confirms its finding that the Claimants possess genuine links to Italy. Accordingly the Tribunal does not consider that Egypt can refuse to recognise Claimants\u2019 Italian nationality on the basis of the asserted lack of genuine link to Italy. This defence, as it applies to the merits, is rejected.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 18 December 2007, p. 27.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Shearer of 15 June 2007, p. 2.\n\nClaimants May Not Oppose Their Italian Nationality to Egypt\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n475.\n\nThis ground of defence was put forward principally by Professor Shearer. Unlike those of Egypt\u2019s claims that were expressed as being based on a lack of genuine link between the Claimants and Italy, the \"opposability\" claim was stated from the outset to be applicable to the merits phase. Professor Shearer stated that opposability and admissibility, upon which his argument was predicated, were \"unaffected by the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction.\"672 Professor Reisman accepted that the ruling of the ICJ in *Nottebohm* was, strictly speaking, one of admissibility rather than jurisdiction.673\n\nIbid., p. 1.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 18 December 2007, p. 27.\n\n476.\n\nAlthough it is also based on *Nottebohm,* Professor Shearer\u2019s argument is said by Egypt to be distinct from the argument that Egypt need not recognise Claimants\u2019 Italian nationality because Claimants lacked a genuine link to Italy. In contrast to the latter argument, Professor Shearer stated that his method of applying **Nottebohm** did not rely on proving a lack of genuine link between the Claimants and Italy. Indeed Professor Shearer described the view that **Nottebohm** laid down a requirement of effective nationality as \"superficial\".674 Instead Professor Shearer opined that \"attention should now turn to the reality of the links of the applicants with Egypt and away from challenging their Italian nationality.\"675\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Shearer of 15 June 2007, p. 2.\n\nIbid.\n\n477.\n\nThe thrust of Professor Shearer\u2019s argument was that *Nottebohm* did not so much state that Mr Nottebohm\u2019s Liechtenstein nationality was ineffective, but that Mr Nottebohm could not \"oppose\" his Liechtenstein nationality to Guatemala, with which he had particularly strong ties. Put another way, Guatemala, but only Guatemala, was entitled not to recognise Mr Nottebohm\u2019s Liechtenstein nationality. Professor Shearer submitted that the same should apply in this case: Claimants\u2019 Italian nationality ought not to be attacked, but Claimants\u2019 strong ties to Egypt should entitle Egypt, and Egypt alone, not to recognise Claimants\u2019 Italian nationalities, valid though they may be.\n\n478.\n\nProfessor Reisman submitted that, despite the re-characterisation of the *Nottebohm* doctrine as one of opposability, \"the substance of the genuine link doctrine remains the same.\"676 The Tribunal shares that view. Professor Shearer\u2019s proposition, while purporting to eschew the \"genuine link\" requirement, would nevertheless require the Tribunal to make a value judgment as to Claimants\u2019 Italian nationality. Professor Shearer\u2019s view could not be sustained solely by looking to Claimants\u2019 ties to Egypt; those ties must be compared to something, which in this case would be Claimants\u2019 ties to Italy. The Tribunal considers that that was the case in *Nottebohm',* it was not simply Mr Nottebohm\u2019s strong ties to Guatemala that \"cost him\", it was the \"extremely tenuous\"677 ties he had with Liechtenstein. In the present case, while Claimants\u2019 ties to Egypt are not in dispute, the Tribunal has determined, and affirmed, that Claimants also have legitimate ties to Italy. Professor Shearer does not seek to challenge that finding.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 18 December 2007, p. 28.\n\n*Nottebohm, supra* note 659, p. 25.\n\n479.\n\nIn contrast, Mr Nottebohm had no ties to Liechtenstein save a resident brother whom he occasionally visited. Mr Nottebohm acquired the nationality of Liechtenstein purely to avoid the repercussions of being German in an Allied nation during the Second World War and \"with the sole aim of thus coming within the protection of Liechtenstein.\"678 The same cannot be said of the Claimants in this case. Both have familial ties to Italy, not only of domicile but of blood, and both acquired Italian nationality well before these proceedings were initiated. As the Tribunal found in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Claimants, unlike Mr Nottebohm with Liechtenstein nationality, did not acquire Italian nationality as a mere expedient.679\n\nIbid., p. 26.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, p. 57.\n\n480.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the *Nottebohm* case can be distinguished on its facts from this case. Mr Siag was married to an Italian citizen and the genuine nature of this union was implicitly recognised by way of the decree granting Mr Siag Italian nationality, issued by the Italian Minister of Interior on 3 May 1993. Mr Siag\u2019s mother, Mrs Vecchi, was born of Italian parents and thus acquired Italian nationality at birth. She subsequently lost that nationality (according to Egypt\u2019s law on nationality) after acquiring her husband\u2019s Egyptian citizenship. After the death of her husband, Mrs Vecchi reacquired her Italian nationality in 1993 by making the requisite declaration under article 17 of the Italian Nationality Law No. 91 of 1992. The evidence therefore shows that both Mr Siag\u2019s maternal grandparents were Italian, that his mother was Italian, that he was married to an Italian citizen and that he subsequently acquired Italian citizenship himself. The Tribunal therefore reiterates its finding in its Decision on Jurisdiction that Italian nationality was acquired for recognised reasons and holds that the Claimants\u2019 links with Italy are genuine and sufficiently strong to allow Claimants to oppose their Italian nationality to Egypt in this dispute. The Tribunal finds that the Claimants\u2019 claims are admissible in these proceedings.\n\nEstoppel\n--------\n\n481.\n\nEgypt submitted that both Claimants were estopped from denying their Egyptian nationalities because both had relied on, and indeed had confirmed, such nationality on numerous occasions in the past in order to acquire and use Egyptian passports, and to conclude business deals.680 Claimants did not contest Egypt\u2019s submission that they had asserted Egyptian nationality to obtain Egyptian passports, nor that they had presented Siag Touristic as an Egyptian company. Claimants denied that their behaviour provided grounds for estoppel.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, pp. 50 - 51. As noted above, this argument was mounted in the jurisdictional phase, where the Tribunal decided (at p. 60 of the Decision) that it was more properly a matter for the merits.\n\n482.\n\nThere is a difference between the parties as to what must be proved in order to make out an estoppel defence, principally as to whether bad faith is required to be shown on the part of the party making the representation, in this case the Claimants. Claimants cited Sir Hersch Lauterpacht, who described estoppel as the situation: \"Where one by his word or conduct wilfully causes another to believe in the existence of a certain state of things....\"681 Egypt on the other hand asserted that \"it is not necessary for Claimants to have wilfully misrepresented their status as Egyptian nationals for purposes of estoppel.\"682\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p 46; Expert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 18 December 2007, p. 31.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder, p. 16.\n\n483.\n\nThe Tribunal prefers Claimants\u2019 submissions in this regard. As a creation of equity, estoppel is grounded in the notion that a person ought not to benefit from his or her wrongs. Brownlie, in his text *Principles of Public International Law683* notes that \"[a] considerable weight of authority supports the view that estoppel is a general principle of international law, resting on principles of good faith and consistency.\" Sir Hersch Lauterpacht, in addition to the statement cited above, offered the view that \"[a] State cannot be allowed to avail itself of the advantages of the treaty when it suits it to do so and repudiate it when its performance becomes onerous. It is of little consequence whether that rule is based on what in English law is known as the principle of estoppels or the more generally conceived requirement of good faith. The former is probably not more than one of the aspects of the latter.\"684 The Tribunal does not consider that Mr Siag or Mrs Vecchi acted other than in good faith in asserting their Egyptian nationality. When cross-examined Mr Siag was candid about the fact that he presented himself as Egyptian when developing the Taba project.685 The Tribunal finds as a fact that the Claimants genuinely believed they were Egyptian nationals at the times when they represented themselves as such. As a matter of Egyptian law Claimants had in fact lost Egyptian nationality, but they were not aware of that fact until much later. The Tribunal accepts the submission of Professor Reisman that Claimants\u2019686 conduct by way of acquiring Egyptian passports, doing business in Egypt, and creating companies was \"fully consistent with a good faith belief that he retained his Egyptian nationality.\" It was not done with the intention of misleading Egypt. Indeed, as Professor Reisman submitted, Egypt, as the state by whose law the Claimants lost Egyptian nationality, knew or ought to have known that Claimants had lost Egyptian nationality.687 The Tribunal finds that the Claimants acted in good faith in obtaining their Egyptian passports and in their subsequent business and other dealings with Egypt. As to the latter, Claimants did not know at that point, nor as lay persons could they reasonably be expected to have known, that in law they had lost their Egyptian nationality. Thus the Claimants are not estopped from now denying their Egyptian nationality.\n\nBrownlie, *Principles of Public International Law* (6th ed., 2003), p. 616.\n\n*Report on the Law of Treaties,* UN Document A/CN.4/63, 24 March 1953, p.157.\n\nT3: 42.\n\nProfessor Reisman refers only to Mr Slag; however, the Tribunal considers that the proposition applies equally to Mrs Vecchi.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 18 December 2008, p. 34.\n\nClaimants Illegally Owned Land in Taba\n--------------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nEgypt submitted that, once the Claimants had lost Egyptian nationality and Mr Siag had increased his holding in Siag Touristic, Siag Touristic (and therefore the Claimants) was no longer allowed to own land in Taba. Egypt argued that Claimants may not recover for the loss of an investment they were legally prohibited from making.688 Claimants replied that it was an undisputed principle of international law that a state may not invoke its municipal law to avoid its international obligations.689 Egypt does not appear to have challenged Claimants\u2019 submission in this regard. It stated that: \"Egypt is not saying that Egyptian law should be applied to alter the bases for relief afforded under the BIT or international law. What it is saying is that the BIT and international law do not banish principles of Egyptian law to the realm of irrelevance when they are in fact crucially relevant - as they already are when a determination must be made as to whether, as a foreign investor, Siag did in fact have ownership in a company that had a lawful right to the property in question.\"690\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, p. 22.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Reisman of 18 December 2007, p. 39.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder, p. 25.\n\n485.\n\nThe Tribunal prefers the Claimants\u2019 arguments on this point. As Brownlie states, \"[t]he law in this respect is well settled. A state cannot plead provisions of its own law...in answer to a claim against it for an alleged breach of its obligations under international law.\"691 Egypt\u2019s obligations to the Claimants under international law and pursuant to the BIT cannot be avoided by recourse to Egypt\u2019s domestic law.\n\nBrownlie, *supra* note 683, p. 34.\n\n486.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that the fact that the laws in question were in place before the expropriation has no effect on the fact that there was an illegal expropriation. That fact does not negate or ameliorate the expropriation, and it does not make the expropriation lawful. The Tribunal is in no doubt that an illegal expropriation occurred, and it accepts Claimants\u2019 submissions that Egypt may not invoke its municipal law to avoid liability for the unlawful expropriation.\n\n**Summary of Tribunal\u2019s Findings on Egypt\u2019s Defences**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n487.\n\nThe Tribunal dismisses each of Egypt\u2019s defences to liability. The Tribunal finds that Claimants have genuine links to Italy and Egypt must accordingly recognise Claimants\u2019 Italian nationality; that Claimants are entitled to oppose their Italian nationalities to Egypt; that Claimants are not estopped from denying Egyptian nationality; and that, an illegal expropriation was carried out by Egypt, which may not be remedied by reference to Egyptian municipal law.\n\n488.\n\nHaving dismissed Egypt\u2019s defences, the Tribunal finds that Egypt is liable to Claimants for unlawfully expropriating Claimants\u2019 investment, in breach of Article 5(1)(ii) of the BIT; and for failing to provide full protection to Claimants\u2019 investment, in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT; and for failing to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of Claimants\u2019 investment, in breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT; and for allowing Claimants\u2019 investment to be subjected to unreasonable measures, in breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT.\n\n**VII. EGYPT\u2019S CHALLENGE TO MRS VECCHI\u2019S CLAIM**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**The Parties\u2019 Early Submissions Regarding Mrs Vecchi\u2019s Claim**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n489.\n\nEgypt\u2019s challenge to Mrs Vecchi\u2019s claim was foreshadowed by Professor Smit\u2019s opinion of 23 November 2007, which was filed as part of Egypt\u2019s reply on bankruptcy. Professor Smit stated that the Tribunal had to determine, by reference to Egyptian law, who, if anyone, had succeeded to Mrs Vecchi\u2019s claims. If Mrs Vecchi\u2019s heirs were Egyptian they could not claim under the BIT or ICSID requirements.692\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Smit of 23 November 2007, pp. 6-7.\n\n490.\n\nClaimants submitted in reply that the statements made by Professor Smit were unsubstantiated and incorrect. In Claimants\u2019 submission the only dates relevant to a jurisdictional inquiry into a party\u2019s nationality were the dates of consent and registration.693 Events that took place after those dates, including Mrs Vecchi\u2019s death, did not affect jurisdiction.694 Even if that were not the case, the nationality of Mrs Vecchi\u2019s heirs was irrelevant.695\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, p. 50.\n\nIbid., pp. 51, 53.\n\nIbid., p. 50.\n\n**Egypt\u2019s Application for Discontinuance of Mrs Vecchi\u2019s Claim (in its Rejoinder on the Merits)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nEgypt submitted in its Rejoinder on the merits dated 12 February 2008 that, unless and until a properly authenticated mandate was received permitting Claimants\u2019 lawyers to represent the interests of the late Mrs Vecchi, her claim should not be the subject of any further proceedings. Egypt requested that the Tribunal order the discontinuance of Mrs Vecchi\u2019s claim pursuant to ICSID Rule 44.696 Professor Smit submitted, citing *Loewen v United States697* as authority, that international law imposed a requirement of continuous nationality on a claimant, and thus a claim by Mrs Vecchi\u2019s Egyptian heirs could not be adjudicated by the Tribunal.698\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, pp. 14-15.\n\n*Loewen Group Inc and Raymond L Loewen v United Statesof America,* ICSID Case ARB(AF)/98/3.\n\nExpert Opinion of Prof Smit of 11 February 2008, p. 8.\n\n**Procedural Order No. 6**\n--------------------------\n\n492.\n\nThis Order, of 15 February 2008, has been discussed above in respect of Egypt\u2019s \"bankruptcy\" and \"Lebanese nationality\" objections to jurisdiction. It also addressed Egypt\u2019s request that Mrs Vecchi\u2019s claim be discontinued. In that respect the Order stated the following:\n\n5.4 The Tribunal also sees the need for clarification of the position with respect to Mrs Vecchi\u2019s Estate before it can rule on the Application for Discontinuance.\n\n5.5 The Tribunal is of the view that oral argument on the Respondent\u2019s three applications should be heard at the start of the period set down for the merits hearing in March. The Tribunal will then decide whether to proceed with the merits hearing or to suspend the proceeding. The parties must come to the hearing on the basis that they must proceed to present their cases on the merits if ordered to do so.\n\n**Further Submissions of the Parties, and the Decision of the Tribunal on Egypt\u2019s Request for the Discontinuance of Mrs Vecchi\u2019s Claim**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n493.\n\nClaimants opposed Egypt\u2019s request for the discontinuance of Mrs Vecchi\u2019s claim on 29 February 2008, asking that the Tribunal retain jurisdiction over her claim, the proceeds of which would be divisible among her heirs. Claimants took particular exception to the claim by Professor Smit that Mrs Vecchi\u2019s heirs were excluded from recovery by the doctrine of continuous nationality as espoused in *Loewen,* which Claimants submitted was a much-criticised and, at best, controversial authority.699\n\nClaimants\u2019 submissions of 29 February 2008, pp. 4-7.\n\n494.\n\nOn 4 March 2008, Egypt reiterated its request that Mrs Vecchi\u2019s claim be discontinued, submitting that it was not appropriate for the Tribunal to continue to hear her claim at the present time.\n\n495.\n\nOn the first day of the hearing, 10 March 2008, the Tribunal directed that, as the Claimants had opposed Egypt\u2019s request for discontinuance, the application would be refused, in compliance with the strict terms of ICSID Rule 44.\n\n496.\n\nOn 11 March 2007, Procedural Order No. 7 was issued, confirming that the application to discontinue Mrs Vecchi\u2019s claim had been dismissed, with costs reserved. The Tribunal stated in Procedural Order No. 7 that its provisional view was, subject to the provision of further evidence as to the precise identity of Mrs Vecchi\u2019s heirs and their legal position under French Law (Mrs Vecchi was residing in France at the time of her death), that there was no valid jurisdictional objection to her claim.\n\n497.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that it would give reasons for its dismissal of this application in the final Award. The Tribunal\u2019s primary reason is the mandatory language of ICSID Rule 44. However, in any event the Tribunal does not accept that the doctrine of continuous nationality is applicable or appropriate to this case. As Claimants have submitted, the doctrine as espoused in **Loewen** has been highly controversial. **Loewen** turned on the question of jurisdiction arising from (a) the NAFTA requirement of diversity of nationality as between a claimant and a government respondent and (b) the assignment by the Loewen Group of its NAFTA claims to a Canadian corporation owned and controlled by a United States Corporation. In its examination of this question, the Tribunal asserted that \"in international law parlance, there must be continuous national identity from the date of the events giving rise to the claim, which date is known as the *dies a quo,* through the date of the resolution of the claim, which date is known as the *dies ad quem.\"700* The Tribunal therefore considered that continuous nationality was a rule of customary international law and dismissed the Claimant\u2019s argument that it had the requisite nationality at the time the claim arose and that it was of no consequence that the ultimate beneficiary of the claim was an American citizen.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, para. 225.\n\n498.\n\nThe **Loewen** decision has been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism by international law scholars and investment arbitration practitioners. In particular, criticism has been levelled at the **Loewen** Tribunal\u2019s cursory treatment of customary international law on a subject where prior influential decisions have held that \"it may well be doubted that the alleged rule [of continuous nationality] has received such universal recognition as to justify the broad suggestion that it is an established rule of international law.\"701 Commentators have also stigmatised the Tribunal\u2019s application of a rule developed in one particular context (diplomatic protection) to another area (investment treaty claims). It is indeed telling that the **Loewen** Tribunal did not cite a single authority in support of any of its propositions with regard to continuous nationality. Finally, academics and practitioners have questioned the relevance of the **Loewen** Tribunal\u2019s conclusions in light of the International Law Commission\u2019s (ILC) subsequent explicit admission that it \"was not prepared to follow the Loewen Tribunal in adopting a blanket rule that nationality must be maintained to the date of resolution of the claim\" and its preference for the \"the date of official presentation of the claim as the *dies ad quem.\"702*\n\n*United States v Germany,* 31 October 1924, VII Reports of International Arbitral Awards 119, at 140 (Edwin B. Parker, Umpire).\n\nILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection with Commentaries (2006), pp. 37-38.\n\n499.\n\nThe Tribunal will not repeat the authorities cited by the Claimants, which further support the critiques mentioned above, but will add its view that the ICSID Convention does not require a party to hold constant nationality until the date an award is rendered. The only dates of relevance to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention are those of consent and registration. In addition, Dolzer and Schreuer note that, in its 2006 Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, the International Law Commission considered that the doctrine of continuous nationality was inappropriate in the case of an individual claim.703 The Tribunal shares that view.\n\nDolzer & Schreuer, *supra* note 166, p. 47.\n\n500.\n\nAs noted, Procedural Order No. 7 made reference to the provision of further evidence from Claimants as to the precise identity of Mrs Vecchi\u2019s heirs and their legal position under French Law. Procedural Order No. 8 directed that such further information be provided by Claimants by 7 April 2008. On 7 April 2008, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 8, Claimants supplied an updated and notarised Power of Attorney executed by Mrs Vecchi\u2019s heirs supplying authority to Mrs Vecchi\u2019s lawyers, King & Spalding LLP, to continue to prosecute the claim. In the view of the Tribunal, this supplies the necessary authority or mandate permitting the Claimants\u2019 lawyers to represent Mrs Vecchi.\n\n**The Parties\u2019 Post-hearing Submissions in Respect of Mrs Vecchi\u2019s Claim**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n501.\n\nClaimants submitted that they had provided all required proof as to the identity of Mrs Vecchi\u2019s heirs and as to the continuing authority of Mrs Vecchi\u2019s former lawyers to pursue her claim.704 Nothing further was relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Mrs Vecchi\u2019s claim.705\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, pp. 19-20.\n\nIbid., p. 21.\n\n502.\n\nEgypt submitted that no attempt had been made to substitute Mrs Vecchi\u2019s heirs as parties to her claim.706 Further, as all Mrs Vecchi\u2019s heirs, with the possible exception of Waguih Siag, were Egyptian, they were each prevented by the doctrine of continuous nationality from taking up her claim.707\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, p. 16.\n\nIbid., p. 17.\n\n**Findings of the Tribunal in Respect of Mrs Vecchi\u2019s Claim**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nThe Tribunal has no hesitation in finding that Mrs Vecchi\u2019s claim under the BIT survived her death, with the result that any sums payable to her are now payable to her estate. The ultimate destination of those funds would be irrelevant if Mrs Vecchi were still alive and it is similarly irrelevant now that she has passed away. The doctrine of continuous nationality does not apply in this case. No doubt the estate will distribute the funds as it sees fit and in accordance with any applicable domestic laws.\n\n**VIII. DAMAGES**\n-----------------\n\n**Introduction**\n----------------\n\n504.\n\nThe Claimants advanced their claim for damages under four heads, as follows:\n\n\u2022 The main claim for the loss of the Property and the Project following the expropriation in May 1996, in a sum just under USD 200 million;\n\n\u2022 A claim for discrete damages of more than USD 30 million, the bulk of which comprise construction costs and financing costs, but which also includes costs expended in domestic legal proceedings consequent upon the expropriation;\n\n\u2022 A claim for compound interest at an unspecified rate; and\n\n\u2022 A claim for all the costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, associated with these proceedings.\n\n505.\n\nThe Claimants have not sought an award of punitive damages but have submitted that Egypt\u2019s conduct in this case entitles the Claimants to \"enhanced damages.\"708 Whilst disowning any claim for a separate lump sum award of punitive damages, the Claimants urged the Tribunal to \"indulge all reasonable inferences in favour of the Claimants\" and, in taking that approach, to impose a measure of damages which provides \"full reparation\" for the Claimants.709\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, p. 36.\n\nIbid., p. 39.\n\n**The Investment**\n------------------\n\n506.\n\nThe loss suffered by the Claimants relates to their investment in Siag Touristic. It is necessary to begin therefore by considering precisely what it was that Siag Touristic had bought or acquired and what it was that was wrongfully expropriated, either directly or indirectly.\n\n507.\n\nThe key document is the agreement dated 4 January 1989 between Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Tourism and Siag Touristic (the \"Sale Contract\"). There is a difference between the parties in terms of the true legal effect of the Sale Contract. The Claimants contended that pursuant to the Sale Contract, Siag Touristic became owner of the Property. Egypt contended that the rights obtained pursuant to the Sale Contract fell short of ownership of the land in question. According to Egypt, the rights conferred under the Sale Contract were merely for Siag Touristic to take possession of the land and develop it, and only later to register itself as owner of the land provided that all obligations under the Sale Contract had been properly satisfied.710\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, para. 55.\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed the Sale Contract in light of these opposing submissions. The document is headed \"Sale Contract of Land in a Touristic Area\" and expresses itself in the language of sale in several important early articles.711 The Sale Contract provided for payment of the contract price in several instalments, the last of which would become payable only 9 years after the date of the agreement, but there is nothing particularly unusual in that. Certainly it cannot be argued that payment by instalments following possession is inconsistent with ownership. In view of the financing arrangements which Siag Touristic was able to obtain in respect of the project, the Tribunal finds it very likely that payment of the purchase price instalments would not have been a significant hurdle for the company. Indeed, those payments would have been trivial compared to the other sums which were required to be expended to complete the Project.\n\nArticle 2 *(\"The first party sold to the second party...* \"); Article 3 *(\"This sale is executed fora total price... \");* and Article 5 (\"... *transfer of ownership of this sold piece of land... \").*\n\n509.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the position is altered by the provisions in the Sale Contract to the effect that registration of Siag Touristic\u2019s ownership of the land would not occur until after the Project had been implemented. Having interfered with and absolutely prevented the due completion of that implementation by Siag Touristic, it is not competent for Egypt now to contend, because registration had not occurred, that Siag Touristic should not be regarded as the owner of the land.\n\n510.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that following execution of the Sale Contract, Siag Touristic was the owner of the Property.\n\n511.\n\nHowever, it must be borne in mind that the Claimants do not own all of Siag Touristic and further, while Siag Touristic owned all of the Project, it did not own all of the Property at the time of the expropriation. 150,000m\u00b2 of the land in question had been transferred to Siag Taba in or around 1993. Siag Taba is 75% owned by Siag Touristic, with remaining shares owned by members of the Siag family including 5% each by the Claimants. The evidence from the Claimants, which was not challenged by Egypt and is accepted by the Tribunal, was that the relevant ownership interests at the time of the expropriation were set out at paragraph 5 of this Award. For convenience those details are re-iterated here:\n\n\u2022 Mr Siag through his interests in Siag Touristic and Siag Taba, owned 84.22% of the Property.\n\n\u2022 Mrs Vecchi through her interests in Siag Touristic and Siag Taba, owned 11.05% of the Property.\n\n\u2022 Mr Siag owned 88.15% of Siag Touristic, and therefore 88.15% of the Project.\n\n\u2022 Mrs Vecchi owned 10.5% of Siag Touristic, and therefore 10.5% of the Project.\n\n\u2022 Together, the Claimants owned 95.27% of the Property and 98.65% of the Project.\n\n512.\n\nAccordingly, it is *prima facie* the case that any award made in favour of the Claimants should represent no more than 95.27% of the total loss suffered by Siag Touristic and Siag Taba in respect of the Property, and 98.65% of the loss suffered by Siag Touristic in respect of the Project.\n\n513.\n\nEgypt\u2019s concerns over the entitlement of Ms Vecchi\u2019s estate to any award made in her favour have been decided. Any sums payable to Ms Vecchi will now be payable to her estate.\n\n514.\n\nAs noted above, the Sale Contract provided payment of the purchase price by way of instalments (together with simple interest of 5%) extending over a number of years. As at 23 May 1996 the purchase price had been paid in full.712\n\nWitness statement of Mr Waguih Siag of 19 December 2007, para. 5.\n\n**The Parties\u2019 Submissions on Damages**\n---------------------------------------\n\nClaimants\n---------\n\n515.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 case in respect of damages was developed in their Submission on Damages dated 30 July 2007. The Claimants submitted that compensation was to be determined in the first instance by any **lex specialis** in the Italy-Egypt BIT, and in the absence of any *lex specialis,* by the rules of customary international law. The Claimants argued that the only **lex specialis** to be found in the BIT was in Article 5 which set out the conditions pursuant to which expropriation was permitted, and the terms on which compensation was to be given for such permissible expropriation.\n\n516.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that Egypt\u2019s expropriation of the Property and Project in this case was unlawful, and that accordingly Article 5 (and in particular its provisions relating to compensation) did not apply.\n\n517.\n\nRelying on *Chorzow Factory713* and the subsequent case law and commentary drawing on that case, the Claimants submitted that they were entitled to be compensated by (i) restitution or its monetary equivalent measured as the higher of (a) the market value of the asset at the time of the expropriation plus compound interest or (b) the current value of the asset; plus (ii) damages for losses not covered by restitution in kind or its monetary equivalent. The combination of measures (i) and (\u00a1\u00a1) was expressed to be necessary to place the Claimants In the same position which they would have been in but for the expropriation of their investment.714\n\n*Case Concerning Factory at Chorzow* (Germany v. Poland), Judgment, 13 Sept. 1928 (1928 PCI J, Series A. No. 17).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Damages, dated 30 July 2007, para. 82.\n\n518.\n\nBy way of alternative formulation, the Claimants submitted that even if the Tribunal were to conclude that the expropriation was not unlawful, and that it was governed by Article 5 of the BIT, the Claimants remained entitled to \"adequate and fair\" compensation in accordance with Article 5(1)(ii). Further, that it was apparent from the inter-relationship between subsections (ii) and (iii) of Article 5 that \"adequate and fair compensation\" for a lawful expropriation satisfying all the conditions set out in Article 5(ii) meant the market value of the investment, provided it could be readily ascertained. Thus, it was submitted, the Claimants were on any view entitled to damages in a sum representing the market value of the Property and Project as at the date of the unlawful expropriation.\n\n519.\n\nAlthough they submitted that they were entitled to choose to value the investment at any point in time following the expropriation, the Claimants chose to present evidence detailing or establishing the market value of the investment as of the date of the expropriation.715 That evidence was based on three distinct methodologies, to be discussed further below. The three methodologies, and the values which were derived by them, were as follows:\n\n\u2022 Comparable Sales Valuation - USD 181,350,000\n\n\u2022 Residual Land Valuation - USD 191,357,357716\n\n\u2022 Lost Business Opportunity (Discontinued Cash Flow) - USD 195,800,000717\n\nIbid., para. 101.\n\nTo which sum the Claimants\u2019 expert (Mr Fleetwood-Bird of CBRE) would add the replacement value of the Caltex Filling Station and the partially-completed works at a total value of USD 9,325,104. However, the \"residual land valuation\" approach, which was Initially one of two methodologies presented by CBRE, was no longer enthusiastically pursued by the time of the hearing - refer para. 93 of the Claimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions.\n\nThis sum took Into account the fact that the Claimants had less than a 100% Interest In the Property/Project.\n\n520.\n\nOn the question of the further discrete damages to which the Claimants might be entitled, it was submitted that the Claimants were entitled to receive compensation for alleged losses in relation to sums expended for construction costs, costs associated with the cancellation of the Lumir Agreement, financing costs, legal expenses and various other sundry costs. In all, the value of this aspect of the claim was stated to be USD 30,911,000.718\n\nWitness statement of Mr Waguih Siag of 19 December 2007, para. 43.\n\n521.\n\nThe Claimants also sought compound interest at a minimum rate of approximately 5.4%, being the then current **(i.e.,** July 2007) LIBOR rate referred to in Article 5(iv) of the BIT. The Claimants also referred to the interest rate of 9% awarded in *Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt719* and urged the Tribunal to award a higher rate of interest **(i.e.,** higher than LIBOR) \"so as to deter similar unlawful State conduct in the future.\"720 During closing submissions on the final day of the merits hearing, counsel for the Claimants also raised, as possible candidates for an appropriate rate of interest, the estimated cost of equity for the Project as adopted by the Claimants\u2019 damages expert LECG of 14.03%, or the rate of interest (16%) payable on one of the commercial loans obtained by Siag Touristic in 1996.721\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award of 8 December 2000, 41 ILM 896 (2002).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Damages, dated 30 July 2007, para. 140.\n\nT 8: 33-34.\n\n522.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that interest should be compounded semi-annually through until the date of payment.722\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Damages, dated 30 July 2007, para. 141.\n\nEgypt\n-----\n\n523.\n\nAs originally presented, Egypt\u2019s opposition to the Claimants\u2019 compensation claims was based on the submission that any compensation should be calculated in accordance with Egyptian law.723 In advancing this argument, Egypt claimed that there are still two cases pending before the Courts in Egypt which will determine the amount of compensation due to Siag Touristic, and that accordingly the Claimants were entitled to no further recovery under the BIT.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 62.\n\n524.\n\nIn subsequent written submissions, Egypt refined this position somewhat and argued that the expropriation had been a lawful expropriation carried out in accordance with Article 5 of the BIT. In taking this position, Egypt directly challenged the Claimants\u2019 position that the expropriation was unlawful and therefore governed by international customary law. According to Egypt, any compensation payable to the Claimants should be calculated solely in accordance with the provisions of the BIT.\n\n525.\n\nEgypt focussed on Article 5(iii) of the BIT and the meaning of the provision requiring that compensation should be calculated on the basis of \"the market value applicable to the investment\" immediately prior to the expropriation. In its treatment of this issue, Egypt placed particular emphasis on the implied requirement in Article 5(iii) that such market value should be capable of being \"readily ascertained.\"\n\n526.\n\nEgypt submitted that there were two transactions which occurred near in time to the expropriation which between them provided a \"readily ascertained\" market value for the investment. The first was the acquisition in 1995 by Mr Siag of an increased shareholding in Siag Touristic, through the purchase of shares from his siblings and Mrs Vecchi. Egypt submitted that the value of those share sales implied a total value for Siag Touristic of USD 3 million.724\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, paras. 61-64.\n\n527.\n\nThe second transaction relied upon by Egypt arose from the Lumir Agreement of August 1994 discussed above in paragraph 25. Following the cancellation of the Lumir Agreement in June 1995 Lumir commenced arbitration proceedings. These were settled in October 1999 by an agreement which obliged Siag Touristic to repay USD 803,000 previously advanced by Lumir, and to pay to Lumir a further lump sum of USD 1,397,000.725 Egypt submitted that the settlement agreement thus implied a total value for the Project (excluding the Hotels and the Casino, which were not part of the Lumir Agreement) of approximately USD 2,800,000.726\n\nExhibit D to witness statement of Mr Yechezkel Elani of 29 July 2007.\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, paras. 65-67.\n\n528.\n\nEgypt\u2019s position was that these two transactions, which straddled the expropriation, were the best or only evidence of a market value which was \"readily ascertainable.\" Egypt further submitted that 50% of any assessed market value of the Property ought to be deducted from the compensation payable to the Claimants by reason of the operation of Article 10 of the Sale Contract.727\n\nArticle 10 of the Sale Contract provided that Siag Touristic could not sell the land to third parties until after the Project was finished, and that when It did It would be obliged to pay Egypt \"50% of the value of the land sale In accordance with the prices prevailing In the area at the time of sale.\"\n\n529.\n\nOn the question of the claim for discrete damages, Egypt submitted that these had not been foreseen by the parties at the time of entering the Sale Contract and were therefore not recoverable. The only damages conceded by Egypt to be recoverable were the price actually part-paid for the land by Siag Touristic up to the time of expropriation, the value of structures and premises constructed and the equipment on the site at the time of expropriation, and the costs of studies undertaken pertaining to the Project.728\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 88.\n\n530.\n\nEgypt submitted that compound interest should not be awarded, and that the rate of simple interest should be 4% in accordance with domestic Egyptian law.729\n\nIbid., paras. 89-92. Notwithstanding the submission in para. 92 that \"general commercial principles\" should apply, Egypt submitted in paras. 89 and 91 that the civil rate of 4% should apply, and not the higher rate of 5% apparently applicable to commercial matters.\n\n531.\n\nAt the merits hearing and in its Post-Hearing Submission dated 24 April 2008, Egypt focussed its challenge on the methodology of the expert evidence presented for the Claimants, and in particular the evidence concerning the lost business opportunity. This will be discussed further in section E below.\n\n**Principles Relevant to an Award of Compensation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n532.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded730 that Egypt violated the provisions of Articles 2 (fair and equitable treatment), 4 (full protection) and 5 (expropriation) of the Italy-Egypt BIT.\n\nSee above, pp. 116-127.\n\n533.\n\nThe most serious of these violations, and the one which most directly caused the Claimants\u2019 loss, is the expropriation which occurred on 23 May 1996 and was either repeated or reiterated on a number of subsequent occasions. The Tribunal proceeds on the basis that the relevant expropriation, for which the Claimants are entitled to relief under the BIT, occurred on 23 May 1996. The Tribunal accepts the Claimants\u2019 submission that they never regained legal ownership of the Property or the Project after that point.731\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, para. 66.\n\n534.\n\nThe Tribunal further accepts that restitution of the Claimants\u2019 investment is not possible. The Property was conveyed to a third party in 2003. In those circumstances, the only relief that is practically available is an award of damages.\n\n535.\n\nThere is a clear dispute between the parties as to the basis upon which such damages should be calculated and awarded. The Claimants submitted that this was an unlawful expropriation for which they were entitled to \"full reparation\" under customary international law.732\n\nIbid, para. 102.\n\n536.\n\nEgypt contended that the expropriation in this case was a taking as contemplated in Article 5 of the BIT. Accordingly, Egypt contended that the assessment of compensation was to be dealt with pursuant to the provisions of Article 5(iii) of the BIT, and in particular the provision that:\n\n\"Where the market value [of the investment] cannot be readily ascertained, the compensation shall be determined on equitable principles taking into account, inter alia, the capital invested, depreciation, capital already repatriated, replacement value, goodwill and other relevant factors.\"\n\n537.\n\nThe Claimants contended that Article 5(iii) of the BIT was not relevant in this case because it applied only to so-called lawful expropriations. The relevance of the distinction, particularly as developed by Egypt in its submissions,733 is that the emphasis in Article 5(iii) on capital invested would result in a recovery for the Claimants in this case significantly below the level for which they contended. It would *prima facie* be restricted to a recovery of the sums expended in the purchase of the Property together with sums expended on construction and the like for which the Claimants, as a result of the expropriation, have received no benefit.\n\n*See* Egypt\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission dated 24 April 2008, paras. 68-71.\n\n538.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that even if Article 5(iii) is applicable to the measure of damages in a case such as this one, consideration is first required to be given to the market value of the investment which has been taken. The clause begins by providing that compensation shall be computed \"... on the basis of the market value applicable to the investment...\" at the time the expropriation was announced or became publicly known. For reasons which will be set out below, the Tribunal does not accept Egypt\u2019s submission that the market value of the land cannot be readily ascertained within the meaning of Article 5(iii). The result is that the second part of Article 5(iii) concerning the determination of compensation based on \"equitable principles\" is not brought into play.\n\n539.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal is satisfied that the compensation provisions within Article 5 of the BIT are not applicable for present purposes except as to the guidance it may provide on the appropriate interest rate734 Reading Article 5 of the BIT as a whole, it is plain that subclause (iii) is concerned with lawful expropriation, which is to say expropriation permitted in terms of subclause (ii). Pursuant to Article 5(ii), investments may not be nationalised or expropriated except on the specific terms stated. Those terms include that the expropriation must be \"... for a public purpose in the national interest of [the] State, for adequate and fair compensation... and in accordance with due process of law.\" For the reasons given in paragraphs 427 to 443 above, the Tribunal is strongly of the view that the expropriation in this case did not satisfy those conditions, and that accordingly it was not a lawful expropriation to which Article 5 of the BIT applied.\n\n*See* para. 597 below.\n\n540.\n\nThe BIT mandates, through Article 5(iii), that compensation for a lawful expropriation is to be based on the actual market value applicable to the investment immediately at the time of expropriation, and further that interest shall be paid from the date of dispossession through until the date of payment. However, it does not purport to establish a *lex specialis* governing the standards of compensation for wrongful or unlawful expropriations. In adopting this analysis the Tribunal notes that it was also the approach followed by the ICSID tribunal in *Vivendi v Argentine Republic.735*\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3 (Resubmission Proceeding), Award, 20 August 2007.\n\n541.\n\nIt is worth observing, however, that in the present case the distinction between compensation for a lawful expropriation and compensation for an unlawful expropriation may not make a significant practical difference. In the *Vivendi* case, the difference was relevant because it went to the question of whether the Claimants were entitled to recover for lost profits. Lost profits did not immediately appear recoverable under the compensation provisions of the relevant BIT, whereas they were arguably recoverable pursuant to the more generous damages regime applicable under customary international law. In the instant case, the Claimants\u2019 do not advance a loss of profits claim *per se.* The recourse to a discounted cash flow analysis for expected future revenue/profit of the project is aimed at ascertaining a present market value for the Property and Project in 1996, and the calculation produces a result not materially different from the alternative basis upon which compensation was calculated, namely an assessment of the market value of the land at the time of the expropriation.\n\n**The Basis to be Adopted by the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n542.\n\nThe basis on which the Tribunal intends to compensate the Claimants is by ascertaining, to the extent possible, the value of the expropriated asset in the Claimants\u2019 hands immediately prior to the expropriation. The Tribunal has no hesitation in concluding that this value far exceeded the sum which was paid by Siag Touristic under the Sale Contract and the sums which had been expended on construction by 23 May 1996 and on other work undertaken in relation to developing and progressing the Project. The Tribunal is persuaded that the opportunity which was identified by Mr Siag was a very promising one and that the Project appeared to be moving forward successfully, albeit that it was still at an early stage.\n\n543.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Egypt\u2019s submission that the Project was doomed to fail. Such a conclusion is itself susceptible to one of the criticisms levelled by Egypt at the Claimants\u2019 expert evidence, namely that it was too early to tell how this Project would fare. That said, there were undoubtedly considerable risks associated with the further investment required to bring the Project to fruition and to realise the potential which the Property and the Project seemed to hold, and it is trite to observe that success in business ventures can never be assured. The Tribunal bears these risks in mind in reaching the final level of compensation which is set out further below.\n\n544.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the Claimants\u2019 request for punitive damages, whether that would be by way of a discrete sum (although noting that the Claimants expressly disavow an entitlement to such a discrete sum) or whether, as submitted by the Claimants in their post-hearing submissions, a punitive element should be introduced into the overall compensation by \"erring in favour of the Claimants.\" There is no provision in the BIT which could be said to give rise to a right for punitive damages or for a treatment of compensation which introduces a punitive element.\n\n545.\n\nThe question whether punitive damages are available is logically distinct from the question whether recovery for an unlawful expropriation should proceed on a different (more generous) basis from recovery for a lawful expropriation. The latter issue almost always concerns an argument over whether certain measures of compensation provided for in the applicable BIT should or should not act as a ceiling to recovery. Punitive damages, by their very nature, are not compensatory. It is worth observing that in the oft-cited *Chorzow Factory* case, the principle derived from that case is that even in the case of an unlawful taking, the relief to be given to the claimant is still purely compensatory. The potential availability of punitive damages, or a punitive \"enhancement\" of compensatory damages, is a matter of some controversy in international law, as indeed the Claimants acknowledged.736 The Tribunal notes that the prevailing view of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal appears to have been that punitive damages are not available737 and it appears that the recovery of punitive or moral damages is reserved for extreme cases of egregious behaviour738.\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, para. 103.\n\nCharles N. Brower & Jason D. Brueschke, The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal 477 (1998).\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Desert Line Projects LLC v. Republic of Yemen,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award of 6 February 2008.\n\n546.\n\nFurther, in attempting to identify precedents for the award of punitive damages, it is necessary to distinguish cases in which the harm suffered by the claimant was not essentially financial in nature, or cases in which what was really being addressed was the level at which compensatory damages should be measured. It was to this latter point that the Claimants ultimately focussed their \"punitive damages\" submissions, acknowledging that their damages must be demonstrated with reasonable certainty and must not be unduly speculative, but urging the Tribunal to register its disapproval of Egypt\u2019s unlawful conduct by \"... [indulging] all reasonable inferences in favour of the Claimants.\"739\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, para. 105.\n\n547.\n\nAs to the latter, the Tribunal is not prepared to draw any inferences other than those justified by the evidence. The burden upon the Claimant is to prove that its loss was caused by the wrongful act of Egypt and to prove to the satisfaction of the Tribunal the quantum of such loss.\n\n548.\n\nAs will become apparent below, the evidence (Comparable Sales Valuation) which underpins the main award of damages in this case was largely unchallenged by Egypt. Notwithstanding the absence of a serious forensic challenge to that evidence, the Tribunal has taken care to satisfy itself that the evidence in question does bear the weight which the Claimants seek to place on it.\n\n**The Expert Evidence on Quantum**\n----------------------------------\n\nThe Evidence for the Claimants\n------------------------------\n\n549.\n\nThe Claimants presented evidence of their loss calculated pursuant to three different methodologies, prepared by LECG, LLC (\"LECG\") and by CB Richard Ellis (\"CBRE\"), the latter firm producing two distinct calculations. LECG produced a lost business opportunity valuation based on a discounted cashflow analysis (\"DCF\"). That analysis resolved the Project into three main components or businesses, namely the timeshare apartments, the two hotels, and the casino. For each of those three businesses LECG worked up expected revenue streams and the income which would be derived from those revenues over the period from 1996 through until 2008. Those cashflows were then discounted back to May 1996, using a weighted average cost of capital of 12.8%, to arrive at a value for the business as at the date of the expropriation.\n\n550.\n\nIn LECG\u2019s original report dated 30 July 2007, the total value of the Project as a business opportunity in the hands of the Claimants740 was calculated to be USD 204.7 million. LECG subsequently prepared a supplemental report dated 20 December 2007 which, by adding further revenue streams which had not been included in the original report, re-valued the Claimant\u2019s interest in the business as USD 223.8 million. Finally, at the hearing, that figure was again revised, this time down to USD 195.8 million.741\n\nThat is to say, taking into account that the Claimants owned less than 100% of the Project.\n\nOn day 7 of the merits hearing, at the beginning of the evidence given by Mr Manuel Abdala.\n\n551.\n\nCB Richard Ellis (\"CBRE\") submitted a report prepared by Mr Fleetwood-Bird which presented two distinct valuations - a \"Comparable Sales Valuation\" and a Residual Land Valuation as at May 1996. The Comparable Sales Valuation was based on the straightforward premise of assessing the value of the Property by reference to sales (or other evidence - for example offers) of comparable land in the region. For reasons associated with the uniqueness of the Property and its relative isolation at the time of the expropriation, evidence was also included of sales which were not contemporaneous, with adjustments being made to account for changes in value over time.\n\n552.\n\nThe Residual Land Valuation was a hybrid method based in part on LECG\u2019s work and in part on comparable sales. The process underlying this valuation method was to begin with the values calculated by LECG for the Hotel, Casino and Timeshares, deduct from those values the construction and development costs, and then add in a value for the reserve land which remained (on which nothing had been constructed, and for which a value was \"borrowed\" from the Comparable Sales method. The obvious difference between the methods was that the Residual Land Valuation method attempted in part to attribute value to the specific Project which the Claimants were developing. For that reason, and perhaps unsurprisingly, it produced a valuation higher than that obtained by the Comparable Sales Valuation method.\n\n553.\n\nThe response by Egypt was essentially to the effect that all of these methods were too speculative. The LECG Lost Business Opportunity calculation was challenged particularly strongly.\n\nEgypt\u2019s criticisms of the Claimants\u2019 calculation of damages\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n554.\n\nIn addressing the quantum evidence presented for the Claimants by CBRE and LECG, Egypt marshalled its arguments around two main themes: first, that the Project was over-ambitious and doomed to fail, and second, that the Claimants\u2019 experts had proceeded upon assumptions which were too optimistic and in any event unsupported by reliable empirical evidence. The latter submission was based in large part on the fact that the Project was still only in the early stages of construction and accordingly there was no trading history available for analysis.\n\n555.\n\nOn the question of whether the Project would have succeeded at all, Egypt submitted that the Project was \"grossly oversized and inappropriate for the market for which it was intended.\"742 Further, Egypt contended that the costs of both building and operating the resort would have far exceeded the Claimants\u2019 estimate.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 95.\n\n556.\n\nWith respect to the timeshare aspect of the resort, Egypt criticised the size of the resort and the number of timeshare intervals which would need to be sold, the basis on which the resort was to be marketed for sale (with reduced emphasis or reliance upon on-site sales), the expectations regarding the likely identity of the market, the intended or assumed pricing of the timeshare intervals, and the phasing of availability of the units for sale.\n\n557.\n\nRegarding the two hotels, Egypt similarly criticised the Claimants\u2019 analysis of value from this aspect of the planned resort as being based on an underestimate of construction costs, and an overstatement of likely hotel revenues.743 The planned resort was also criticised for not incorporating a golf course.744\n\nIbid., paras. 106-109.\n\nIbid., para. 110.\n\n558.\n\nEgypt made a comprehensive challenge to the planned casino and its likely profitability. Factors criticised included the size of the casino which Egypt said would have been the largest in the Middle East and one of the largest in Europe, and yet no feasibility study had been undertaken to determine whether a market existed for a casino of such size (or any size) in that location.745 Egypt criticised the assumptions made on behalf of the Claimants as to the total revenue which the casino might have generated, the availability and willingness of a suitable investor/operator to participate on terms favourable to the Claimants, and the long-term viability of the area as an up-market tourist destination in light of previous and subsequent terrorist acts in the region.746\n\nIbid., paras. 114-116.\n\nIbid, paras. 123-125.\n\n559.\n\nMost of these criticisms were reiterated and amplified in Egypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits dated 12 February 2008. That Rejoinder did not contain much specific criticism of the CBRE analyses, although it must be the case that any criticism of the LECG methodology and calculation is a criticism which also goes to CBRE\u2019s Residual Land Valuation.\n\n560.\n\nIn relation specifically to the Comparable Sales Valuation, Egypt drew attention to the disparity between the sum paid for the Property by Siag Touristic and the value ascribed to it as at several years later by CBRE.747 Egypt criticised the reliance by CBRE on information which was not derived from completed sales, and further criticised some of the sales data which was relied upon as being insufficiently comparable, and of doubtful relevance in light of the numerous adjustments required to made to arrive at a 1996 \"Taba\" value.748\n\nEgypt\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 176.\n\nIbid., paras. 178-180.\n\n561.\n\nIn relation to the claim for discrete reliance damages, Egypt submitted that the Claimants had presented little or no evidence of expenditure said to have been incurred under the various heads.749\n\nIbid., paras. 187, 188.\n\n**Discussion**\n--------------\n\n562.\n\nThe Tribunal proceeds on the basis that the burden of proving and measuring a loss rests at all times with the Claimants.\n\n563.\n\nIn general terms, the Tribunal finds on the evidence that the Claimants have been permanently deprived of a valuable investment, and that the value of that investment exceeds by a considerable margin the sums actually expended by the Claimants. The Tribunal does not accept the submission by Egypt that the Project was doomed to fail for being too big and poorly located. While this is by no means the sole reason for such conclusion, Egypt\u2019s submissions in that regard were undermined by the discovery that a company owned and controlled by Egypt has recently launched the Riviera Centre project in Taba, which is to be located only some 20 km south of the Property and will be several times larger than the Project was planned to be.\n\n564.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Egypt\u2019s submission that the 1995 sale of shares in Siag Touristic between members of the Siag family provides useful guidance as to the value of the Property and Project. A transaction such as that is self-evidently unlikely to be a reliable proxy for an open-market transaction conducted at arms length on normal commercial terms. There are simply too many (obvious) non-commercial factors which might affect the price at which the transaction is concluded.\n\n565.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Tribunal holds that the Lumir Agreement, and in particular the settlement of the dispute which arose following its cancellation, does not provide reliable evidence of the value of the Claimants\u2019 investment. Apart from the obligation to repay USD 803,000 there was no evidence available as to the basis on which the settlement sum was calculated.\n\n566.\n\nHowever, while the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants\u2019 investment was a substantial one, and one considerably more valuable than portrayed by Egypt, the Tribunal is not satisfied that it was an investment which lends itself to a robust DCF analysis.\n\n567.\n\nAt the end of his evidence, Mr Abdala of LECG was asked by the Tribunal a question concerning the differences in valuing the future profits of a business which has been operating for several years, as compared to a \"business opportunity\" which is still in the development phase. Mr Abdala very candidly acknowledged that there is one particular difference and this is that\"... in the [case] that you have a track record of profitability you could say that you have a higher degree of certainty as to what to expect of the performance of the business in the future.\"750 He further offered that \"... in both cases, whether you\u2019re valuing new business or [existing] business, you will still have a certain degree of uncertainty as to projecting revenues moving forward, and profits moving forward.\"751\n\nT7: 131. This difficulty had also been acknowledged and discussed in LECG\u2019s original report - refer para. 48.\n\nIbid.\n\n568.\n\nThis point is perhaps obvious, but it is nonetheless significant. Of equal importance are the numerous \"moving parts\" which contribute to a DCF analysis, whether at the front end in terms of building up the model of revenue and operating costs and capital expenditure, or in terms of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\"WACC\") used to discount future cash flows back to a present value. On the question of capital expenditure, the Tribunal notes that in accounting for construction costs, LECG relied on information provided to it by Mr Fleetwood-Bird of CBRE, which information Mr Fleetwood-Bird explained he had obtained from a discussion with an architect in Cairo.752 It was necessarily a sketch or rough estimate of what such costs might be.\n\nT4:85-87. It is evident from LECG\u2019s supplemental report that they (erroneously) believed these figures had been provided by the Project\u2019s architect. Refer para. 127 of LECG\u2019s supplemental report, dated 20 December 2007.\n\n569.\n\nSimilarly, on the question of WACC, it is self-evident from the nature of a DCF analysis that a small change in the WACC can produce very considerable changes in the absolute value of a business. In the present case, LECG adopted a WACC of 12.79%. The experts who presented evidence for Egypt presented alternative scenarios in which the WACC would be more like 20% or higher. It is not necessary to attempt the impossible exercise of determining which figure is \"right\" to realise that the DCF analysis in such a case is attended by considerable uncertainty.\n\n570.\n\nPoints such as those just mentioned tend to reinforce the wisdom in the established reluctance of tribunals such as this one to utilise DCF analyses for \"young\" businesses lacking a long track record of established trading. In all probability that reluctance ought to be even more pronounced in cases such as the present where the business is still in its relatively early development phase and has no trading history at all. The Tribunal accepts Egypt\u2019s submission753 that the authorities are generally against the use of a DCF analysis in circumstances such as the present, and further that the DCF analysis presented by LECG is an insufficiently certain basis upon which to calculate damages in the present case.\n\nEgypt\u2019s post-hearing submissions, para. 74.\n\n571.\n\nThat conclusion in itself is sufficient to dispose also of the Residual Land Value calculation, given that it was dependent in significant part upon values borrowed from LECG\u2019s report on the measure of the Lost Business Opportunity. In any event, by the time of closing submissions it was apparent that the Claimants were focussing their efforts on the Comparable Sales Valuation in preference to the Residual Land Valuation.754\n\nClaimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions, para. 93.\n\n572.\n\nAs to the Comparable Sales Valuation, the Tribunal was very impressed by Mr Fleetwood-Bird and the evidence he gave. His initial report (27 July 2007) was appropriately qualified by the acknowledgement that in his view, he did not have sufficient data at that point to arrive at an independent valuation based on the comparable sales approach, although he did offer a range of USD 141,275,000 to USD 183,525,000. His supplemental report (21 December 2007) outlined the further inquiries that had been made and the extra data that had been obtained, all of which enabled him to provide a firm valuation. That report stated a value for the Property of USD 183,300,000 which was subsequently corrected slightly during the hearing to USD 181,350,000.755\n\nHe made certain revisions to his report. (See T4: 12-14).\n\n573.\n\nMr Fleetwood-Bird\u2019s credentials and experience are excellent. The inquiries made by him were wide-ranging. Further, the Tribunal found him to be a very thoughtful, professional and fair-minded person whose opinion on matters within his area of expertise could be relied upon. While Egypt made a wide ranging challenge to the viability of the project, it did not adduce evidence of a property valuation such as the one carried out by Mr Fleetwood-Bird.\n\n574.\n\nIt has already been noted above that Egypt itself has recently commenced construction of a very substantial resort development in roughly the same location known as \"the Riviera Centre.\"756 The desirability of the Property\u2019s location, and its suitability as a site for resort development by Siag, was emphasised by Mr Fleetwood-Bird in his original report:\n\n\"The quality of the Property compares with the best resort sites in Sharm El Sheik, Hurghada and elsewhere in the Sinai and Red Sea areas and this, coupled with the unique character of the Property close to Eilat in Israel and Aqaba in Jordan would have ensured that had resort development been permitted, the Property would have become a central feature of a major coastal resort.\"757\n\nIt is precisely this desirability of the Property, confirmed as it is by the development of the Riviera Centre, which supports the substantial valuation accorded to the Property by Mr Fleetwood-Bird.\n\nPara. 563 above.\n\nCBRE Report of 27 July 2007, p. 34.\n\n575.\n\nAt the end of his cross-examination Mr Fleetwood-Bird was asked by the Tribunal what margin of error he would apply to his Comparable Sales Valuation. His response was that ordinarily he would hope to be within 5% either side of an exact or precise figure. However, in view of the uniqueness of this Property and the difficulties which he acknowledged were attendant upon conducting this particular valuation, he stated that in the present case: \"I believe that percentage should be wider, and it could be at least 10% on either side of my figure.\"758 (Emphasis added.)\n\nT4: 121-122.\n\n576.\n\nIn all the circumstances, the Tribunal increases that margin to 20% and will apply that discount to the value of the Property as assessed by Mr Fleetwood-Bird (USD 181,350,000). That produces a value of USD 145,080,000. It is to be borne in mind that this is the value of the entire Property as at 23 May 1996. The Claimants\u2019 total interest in the Property at that time was 95.27%.\n\n577.\n\nIn addition to recognising that the Claimants had less than a 100% interest in the Property, it is important to bear in mind also the terms upon which that interest was held as at the date of expropriation. The Tribunal has in mind the provisions of Article 10 of the Sale Contract, which provided as follows:\n\n\"[Siag Touristic] may not dispose of all or part of the piece of land, subject of this contract, to third parties except after the approval of [Egypt], subject to finishing the project. In such a case [Egypt] shall get 50% of the value of land sale in accordance with the prices prevailing in the area at the time of sale.\"\n\n578.\n\nEgypt expressly relied upon Article 10, submitting that \"pursuant to Article 10 of the Contract, any transfer of title of the Property will entitle the TDA to receive 50% of the sale value according to the prevailing price in the area, an amount that needs to be deducted from any assessed market value in order to reach the due compensation to Siag Touristic, if any.\"759 It also contended that \"it was only after finishing the project that Siag Touristic would have been permitted to sell the land to third parties, and, when it did, it would be obliged to pay to the Egyptian government 50% of the value of the land sale....\"760 The Tribunal does not accept Egypt\u2019s further submission that this contractual term had an \"obvious effect\" on the value of the land,761 but the Tribunal does accept that it had an effect on the value of the asset in the Claimants\u2019 hands.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 73.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions, para. 55.\n\nIbid., where the implication appears to be that the existence of this clause reduced the overall value of the land in some objective sense.\n\n579.\n\nArticle 10 is not without its difficulties - in particular there may be uncertainty over the correct construction of the words \"subject to finishing the project.\" The clause could mean that prior to finishing the Project, Siag Touristic could only sell the land with the consent of Egypt, and would be required to account to Egypt for half the value of the transferred land. Or it could mean that prior to completion of the Project there was a complete bar on any transfer of the land, but that following completion a transfer could be made with consent of Egypt, and again with the requirement to account for 50% of the value. In the present case, it is an undisputed fact that Egypt\u2019s expropriation of the Property made it impossible for Siag to finish the Project. The Tribunal considers therefore that a reading of Article 10 which would require Siag to have finished the Project before being able to dispose of the Property cannot be relied on by Egypt to disqualify the Claimants from recovery of the loss suffered, since the Claimants\u2019 incapacity to respect that particular condition was a direct result of Egypt\u2019s own illegal conduct. It would appear, however, that regardless of which interpretation is correct, the most that Siag Touristic could have hoped to retain from a sale of the land was 50% of the net proceeds.\n\n580.\n\nThat is particularly relevant in circumstances where the Tribunal is valuing the expropriated asset on the basis primarily of its underlying land value, and awarding compensation accordingly.\n\n581.\n\nThe Tribunal has given careful consideration to the argument that the act of expropriation was a repudiation of the Sale Contract, and that in a sense therefore Egypt is seeking to enforce a provision in a contract which it repudiated. However, the Tribunal is concerned to compensate the Claimants for what has been taken, and the effect of Article 10 was that immediately prior to the expropriation, Siag Touristic\u2019s beneficial interest in the Property was only 50%. Article 10 was no doubt included for good commercial reasons (relating to the price for which the Property was offered to Siag Touristic, and the desirability from Egypt\u2019s point of view in having the Project completed) and it was a provision which was willingly accepted by the Claimants through Siag Touristic.\n\n582.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that an award of damages should, as far as possible, put the injured party in the position he or she would have been in had there been no expropriation. In the calculation of such damages, regard would have to be had to the fact that, but for the expropriation, the Claimants would only have been able to dispose of the Property under the conditions fixed in Article 10 of the Contract. Thus, in the event of a sale of the Property, the Claimants would have received 50% of the sale value. Faced with this objective measure of the Claimants\u2019 beneficial interest in the Property, the Tribunal finds that it cannot disregard the express stipulations of Article 10 and simply assume that the Contract would have continued until completion of the Project.\n\n583.\n\nTherefore, in circumstances where the Claimants themselves were content to bind themselves to an entitlement of only 50% of the value of the land in the event of any sale of the Property or part of it (a factor which would undoubtedly also have affected other transactions such as borrowings secured against the Property), the Tribunal considers it would be surprising if the expropriation would result in payment to the Claimants of a sum representing the whole value of the Property. It may have been the case that the Project could have been structured, and even sold down in subsequent years, in such a way as to avoid any need to sell the underlying land,762 but the Tribunal prefers to apply a simple analysis to what is on its face a fairly simple contractual term. This is more so given the rejection of the DCF analysis and the focus on the underlying land value of the Property. Plainly, it was land value with which Article 10 was concerned.\n\nA point made by Mr Abdala of LECG during cross examination *(see* T7: 90).\n\n584.\n\nThe result is that the value of USD 145,080,000 (calculated by applying a 20% discount to Mr Fleetwood-Bird\u2019s Comparable Sales Valuation of USD 181,350,000) should then be reduced by 50% to USD 72,540,000. For the purposes of compensation, that sum must be further reduced by recognising that the Claimants\u2019 total interest in the Property was not 100% but 95.27%. That yields a figure for compensation purposes of USD 69,108,858.\n\nDiscrete Damages - Construction Costs\n-------------------------------------\n\n585.\n\nTurning to discrete damages, the single biggest item claimed was USD 15,643,000 for construction costs. The Tribunal must be careful to avoid any double counting. It is apparent from Mr Fleetwood-Bird\u2019s original report that his final valuation figures included the Gross Replacement Cost of the buildings and other site works (including the service station) which were on the Property at the time of the expropriation.763 Mr Fleetwood-Bird\u2019s assessment of that cost was USD 9,325,000. Insofar as that figure differs (and differs substantially) from the figure provided by Mr Siag, the Tribunal prefers the evidence of Mr Fleetwood-Bird.\n\nCBRE Report, 30 July 2007, p. 39.\n\n586.\n\nThe question then is whether the revised figure of USD 181,350,000 already includes the value of construction work carried out prior to the expropriation. The Tribunal finds that it does not. CBRE\u2019s supplemental report concludes by stating explicitly that \"... the fair market value of the Property using the Comparable Sales methodology, excluding the improvements thereon, in 1996 was US$282 per sq m or US$183,300,000764 for the 650,000 sq m.\"765 (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that there is no double compensation in awarding damages for both the value of the expropriated Property (which excludes any value added by the buildings and other site works) and the construction costs.\n\nAs previously noted, this figure was corrected during the hearing to USD 181,350,000.\n\nCBRE Supplemental Report, 21 December 2007, p. 21.\n\n587.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it is appropriate to apply the same method of calculation of the Claimants\u2019 interest in the construction costs as that adopted in the calculation of the damages awarded for the loss of the Property. It is most likely that, had a sale of the Property taken place in 1996, such a sale would have included any constructions on the land itself. Thus, under article 10 of the Sale Contract, the Claimants would only have been entitled to their 95.27% interest in 50% of the value added by those constructions. In light of the preceding considerations, the Tribunal therefore awards the sum of USD 4,441,936.75 in respect of the construction costs sought by the Claimants.\n\nSalaries and Benefits\n---------------------\n\n588.\n\nThe Claimants seek USD 730,000 for \"salaries and benefits\" and a further USD 138,000 for \"rents and utility bills\". In both cases these relate to sums allegedly expended after the expropriation. There has been no reliable evidence presented relating to either of these claims. No award is made in respect of them.\n\n589.\n\nThe Claimants seek USD 500,000 for \"travels and fairs\". The Tribunal has already noted that Egypt has conceded that damages are payable for, inter alia, \"the costs of studies undertaken pertaining to the Project.\" Notwithstanding that concession, it is impossible to ascertain what is actually comprised under this head of damages, and to what extent any of it can be characterised as \"studies pertaining to the Project\" or similar. Further, and ultimately this is a greater difficulty for the Claimants, there is no reliable evidence of sums actually expended. The Tribunal declines to make award in respect of this head of damages.\n\n590.\n\nA sum of USD 2,650,000 (together with compound interest) is sought in relation to the cancellation of the Lumir Agreement and its subsequent settlement. This claim cannot succeed. The Lumir Agreement was terminated by Siag Touristic in June 1995, nearly a year before the expropriation. If there had been no expropriation there would still have been a dispute with Lumir, and there would still have been costs incurred in settling that dispute.\n\nBank Loans\n----------\n\n591.\n\nThe second largest head of discrete damages is for a sum of USD 8,750,000 relating to \"Bank Loans.\" This arises from a loan obtained by Siag Touristic in May 1995 from the Egyptian Arab Land Bank. Prior to the account being frozen following the expropriation, the total drawdown had been LE7,979,845. By reason of the application of penalty interest, that debt had grown by 30 November 2005 to be LE34,947,079, and was continuing to incur interest at 16% plus a further 2% penalty. By the end of 2007 the total sum owing was estimated to be LE48,000,000 or USD 8,750,000.\n\n592.\n\nThe first difficulty with this claim is that it is a debt of Siag Touristic. On the face of it, there being no evidence of personal guarantees or other personal liability for the Claimants, neither Mr Siag nor Mrs Vecchi have suffered a loss. Secondly, the assessment of damages is made as at May 1996. If the Property had not been expropriated and had been sold at that point this loan would have had to be repaid out of the proceeds of sale. To the extent that penalty interest has since been accruing, it is counterbalanced by the inclusion of interest on the sum to be awarded as damages.\n\nLegal Expenses\n--------------\n\n593.\n\nFinally, the Claimants seek the sum of USD 2,500,000 for the legal expenses incurred in bringing their claims before the domestic courts over a period of more than 7 years.766 No invoices, receipts or other accounting material was produced in support of this claim. However, there is no doubt that the Claimants had to employ Egyptian lawyers as well as in-house lawyers during the long period of litigation. Mr Siag in the Third Witness Statement of December 19, 2007 explained at some length that he needed to retain various lawyers to argue the cases. He also spelt out the extensive number of hearings and all of the meetings with the lawyers which were necessary to prepare for the hearings. In paragraph 40 he said that there had been employed seven different lawyers over the period of the litigation who were in turn assisted by an in-house junior lawyer from Siag Touristic. In paragraph 41 of his evidence he stated that he believed he had \"spent over US$750,000 on case administration ie, transportation and accommodation, copying, telephone and fax, Court fees, experts reports etc. This represents approximately US$70,000 per year. For the case our lawyers and I had to travel to Sinai to the Police Station in Nuweibaa, the District Attorney\u2019s Office in El Tor, the El Tor Courts, and the Appeal Court in Suez.\" He conservatively estimated his total legal costs for the proceedings in Egypt for the past eleven years to be in excess of USD 2,500,000. After giving this matter careful consideration the Tribunal considers it appropriate that USD 1,000,000 in respect of this aspect of the claim.\n\nParas. 43-87 above.\n\nInterest\n--------\n\n594.\n\nClaimants sought interest on all damages \"at the highest appropriate rate\"767 and further sought that it be compounded at six month intervals.768 Egypt countered that interest should be simple interest only, and that it should be at the rate of just 4% as permitted by domestic Egyptian law in respect of civil matters.769\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply Memorial on the Merits, para. 240.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submissions on Damages, dated 30 July 2007, para. 141.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, paras. 89-92.\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal has no hesitation in ruling that interest should run from the date of the expropriation, and that it should be compounded. The Claimants submitted that since 2000, no less than 15 out of 16 BIT tribunals have awarded compound interest on damages in investment disputes.770 Whether or not that statistic is correct, the Tribunal is certain that in recent times compound interest has indeed been awarded more often than not, and is becoming widely accepted as an appropriate and necessary component of compensation for expropriation.771 There is nothing in the present case to suggest that an award of compound interest would be inappropriate, nor any reason to believe that simple interest would provide adequate compensation for the deprivation of an asset for more than 12 years. Further, the Claimants\u2019 request that interest be compounded only at half-yearly intervals is a modest and appropriate request.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply Memorial on the Merits, para. 242.\n\nSee, *e.g.,* the discussions **in** The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law (Muchlinski, Ortino & Schreur eds. 2007), at p. 1107; and **in** McLachlan, Shore & Weiniger, International Investment Arbitration 343-346 (2007).\n\n596.\n\nThe Tribunal has found the question of the rate of interest to be more difficult. The higher rates suggested by the Claimants were based on cost of financing but it will be readily observed that the bulk of the damages awarded to the Claimants derive not from costs which have been borne and are only now being recovered, but from an asset which has been taken. In those circumstances, interest should expressly be tied to the loss of opportunity to invest, and not to the cost of servicing debt. The Tribunal will award interest on an investment basis.\n\n597.\n\nSome guidance is available from the BIT. Article 5, which sets out the basis on which so-called \"lawful\" expropriation may occur, provides at sub-clause (iv) that \"compensation for any such expropriation should include interest at the current six month LIBOR rate of interest from the date of nationalisation or expropriation until the date of payment.\" The Tribunal has already observed that in the present case there may be no practical difference between compensation for a lawful or unlawful expropriation.772 In the same way, it can be said that if LIBOR rates were thought to compensate adequately for delay in payment of compensation for a lawful expropriation, there is no reason not to hold that they are similarly adequate to compensate in case of delayed payment of compensation for an unlawful expropriation.\n\nSee para. 541 above\n\n598.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal orders that Interest should be paid on all sums of damages awarded hereunder, at the six month LIBOR rates applicable from time to time since 23 May 1996 through until the date of payment, with such interest being compounded six-monthly.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n599.\n\nAs an initial point it must be noted that the costs of not only the merits phase of the proceedings773 but also the original jurisdiction phase, which culminated in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction dated 11 April 2007, fall to be determined. As recorded above, the Decision on Jurisdiction reserved the issue of costs related to that phase of the arbitration.\n\nWhich, for ease of reference, is taken to include Egypt\u2019s jurisdictional objections raised subsequent to the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n**The Tribunal\u2019s directions as to costs**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n600.\n\nOn 9 December 2008, the members of the Tribunal conveyed to the parties the following:\n\n\"The Tribunal has made considerable progress with the drafting of its Award. Before the closing of proceedings, the Tribunal is however obliged to consider any claims for legal costs and expenses made by the parties.\n\nAs to the Claimants, it will be recalled that the total amount sought by the Claimants is US$8,411,491.72, of which US$6,071,978.08 is for attorney\u2019s fees. The nest largest component of the costs claim is US$1,035,814.00 for the fees of LECG along with US$135,591.00 in relation to CBRE fees.\n\nIn an email to the Tribunal, dated 8 May 2008, Egypt submitted that the Tribunal should not accept the schedule of costs annexed to the Claimants\u2019 post-hearing memorial until the Claimants had adduced documentation in support of the claim for costs and Egypt had had the opportunity to comment thereon. In its response dated 13 May 2008, Claimants said they would provide supporting documentation if the Tribunal so requested.\n\nThe Tribunal now does so request.\n\nAs to the Respondent, in its post-hearing submissions dated 24 April 2008 it also sought costs in this proceeding, including experts\u2019 and attorney\u2019s fees. Egypt further requested the Tribunal\u2019s guidance as to the submission of its claim in this respect.\n\nThe Respondent is therefore requested to submit documentation in respect of its claim for costs.\n\nTo ensure an orderly procedure, the following will be the sequence:\n\n1. Claimants, as promised earlier, are requested to submit further documentation is support of their costs claims no later than 19 December 2008.\n\n2. Egypt is requested to submit to the Tribunal a combined statement of (a) its own costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and (b) its comments on the details of the Claimants\u2019 costs claim no later than 16 January 2009 (the longer period for filing takes into account the year-end holiday period).\"\n\n601.\n\nOn 19 December 2008, the Claimants provided further documentation in support of their claim for costs. By letters dated 11 and 16 January 2009, Egypt contended that the Claimants had still not provided adequate substantiation of their claim for costs and requested that the Tribunal direct the Claimants to produce further documentation in this respect.\n\n602.\n\nOn 6 March 2009 the Tribunal advised the parties that it considered that the submissions and documentation provided by the parties were sufficient to enable it to make an award on costs without the need for further documentation.\n\n**The Claimants\u2019 Submissions on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n603.\n\nIn section G of the Claimants\u2019 post-hearing submissions,774 the Claimants requested the Tribunal to award them all costs and expenses associated with this arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees. The Claimants noted that \"in addressing similarly inexcusable conduct by the Egyptian Government, the Tribunal in *Wena Hotels Ltd v. Arab Republic of Egypt775* awarded the claimant its costs and fees associated with presenting its case on the merits.\" The Claimants contend that the Tribunal in this case should do likewise.\n\n24 April 2008, at para. 137.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/98/4.\n\n604.\n\nThe Claimants further submitted that although Egypt\u2019s conduct throughout the underlying dispute with Mr Siag was ample reason to award the Claimants their full costs, the Tribunal should also consider Egypt\u2019s procedural misconduct in this proceeding. They contended that Egypt had repeatedly defied the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction and \"has subjected the Claimants to frivolous requests for a \u2019special estoppel sub-phase\u2019, an \u2019effective nationality\u2019 discovery request, extensive \u2019effective nationality\u2019 arguments in its Counter Memorial and Rejoinder under the guise of \u2018estoppel\u2019 and opposability, a belated \u2019bankruptcy\u2019 jurisdictional objection based on a matter emerging from its own Courts and slanderous allegations of \u2019forgery and fraud\u2019 that are now largely retracted and that never had a sound evidentiary basis.\" The Claimants concluded by contending that Egypt\u2019s misconduct in this proceeding had substantially increased the time and effort required for the Claimants to prosecute their claims and should be meaningfully sanctioned by the Tribunal in its award on Costs. The total amount of Claimants\u2019 claim for its costs and expenses was USD 8,411,491.72. Of that amount, the value of time incurred by the Claimants\u2019 counsel from the inception of this matter until 31 March 2008, at their normal billing rates, was said to be USD 6,071,978.08. Because of the Claimants\u2019 financial circumstances they had asked, and the Claimants\u2019 counsel had agreed, that the Claimants will pay attorney\u2019s fees only on a successful recovery in this matter. It was argued that since the Claimants were contractually obligated to pay such fees, they should be entitled to an award of fees equal to the value of the time worked by their counsel.\n\n605.\n\nThe following is a summary of the Claimants\u2019 fees and expenses :\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Summary of Claimants\u2019 Fees and Expenses** | Combined Total (USD) |\n| **Attorney\u2019s Fees and Expenses** King & Spalding - Value of Time | $6,071,978.08 |\n| Transcription Costs | $29,779.07 |\n| Duplication and Binding Costs | $85,147.94 |\n| Travel costs | $232,047.01 |\n| Document Delivery Costs | $36,979.88 |\n| Translation Costs | $18,106.80 |\n| Telephone/TeleConference/Telecopy Costs | $10,124.39 |\n| On-Line Computer and Other Research Costs | $7,692.54 |\n| **Testifying Experts\u2019 Fees and Expenses** CBRE | $135,591.29 |\n| Abillama | $26,250.00 |\n| LECG | $1,035,814.02 |\n| Reisman | $132,500.00 |\n| Riad | $25,000.00 |\n| Rubinstein | $120,979.80 |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Consulting Experts\u2019 Fees and Expenses** Abbadi | $2,001.57 |\n| Glencer | $36,057.33 |\n| Margolis | $14,434.50 |\n| Zarntsky | $14,437.50 |\n| Sacerdoti | $11,570.00 |\n| **ICSID Advances Paid** | $365,000.00 |\n| TOTAL | $8,411,491.72 |\n\n606.\n\nOn 8 May 2008, counsel for Egypt questioned the adequacy of the submissions on costs in the Claimants\u2019 Post-hearing Memorial and alleged that the compensation of the Claimants\u2019 experts may be contingent upon the Claimants\u2019 recovery in this case. In a subsequent letter dated 13 May 2008, the Claimants pointed out that this was not the case and confirmed that LECG and the Claimants\u2019 other experts had all been paid in full for their services rendered.\n\n**Egypt\u2019s Submissions on Costs**\n--------------------------------\n\n607.\n\nOn 16 January 2009, Egypt submitted a combined statement of (a) its own costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and (b) its comments on the details of the Claimants\u2019 costs claim.\n\n608.\n\nIn its letter of 16 January 2009, Egypt referred to the general practice of ICSID Tribunals as to awarding costs and made the following submissions:\n\n\"The starting principle is that the Tribunal may in the sound exercise of its discretion award claims for legal costs and expenses to the extent that it deems it appropriate to make such an award, provided that the costs awarded are reasonable. Thus, Rule 28(b) of the ICSID Convention requires that each party submit to the Tribunal \"a statement of the costs ***reasonably*** incurred or borne by it in the proceeding...\" Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention allows an ICSID Tribunal to **\"assess** the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings...\" (Emphasis added).\n\nThe great majority of tribunals in ICSID arbitrations have exercised their discretion in this regard by ordering that the parties bear their own legal costs regardless of the outcome of the arbitration. See, e.g., Malaysian Historical Salvors SDN, BHD v Malaysia, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10, 17 May 2007 (stating \"it is common ICSID practice for each party to bear its own legal costs and for the arbitration costs to be divided equally regardless of the outcome of the arbitration\"); W. Ben Hamida, *Cost Issue in Investor-State Arbitration Decisions Rendered Against the Investor: a Synthetic Table,* 5(5) Transnational Dispute Management (Nov. 2005) (concluding, after an exhaustive study of investor-state arbitration decisions that \"the majority of arbitral tribunals decided that each party shall bear the expenses incurred by it in connection with the arbitration...\").\n\nThe only exception to this general practice has been where one party has presented spurious claims or engaged in bad-faith litigation. See, e.g., Matthew Weiniger & Matthew Page, *Treaty Arbitration and Investment Disputes: Adding up the Costs,* 3 Glob. Arb. Rev. 44 (2006). Committing a fraud on both the Egyptian Government as well as this Tribunal is clearly an example of bad-faith litigation. Thus, if the Tribunal should determine that Waguih Siag acted with fraudulent intent when he presented a spurious Lebanese government document to both the Egyptian government and this Tribunal for the purposes of falsely representing his status as a supposed Lebanese national, then not only should Claimants\" requests for payment of their legal fees and costs be rejected but Respondent should be awarded all of its legal fees and costs, including the administrative costs paid by it to ICSID. Had Mr Siag not engaged in such a fraud, he never would have had a basis for claiming that he had lost his Egyptian nationality and therefore would not have been able to initiate this proceeding.\"\n\n609.\n\nEgypt contended that, should the Tribunal rule in favour of the Claimants and give consideration to deviating from a general practice concerning the award of costs, it should take into account in determining reasonableness the Claimants\u2019 failure to provide substantiation of their legal fees. It submitted that their failure to submit proof of legal fees beyond a mere summary spreadsheet should by itself, regardless of the outcome of the case, prevent them from receiving reimbursement of such purported expenditures.\n\n610.\n\nEgypt also submitted that the amounts claimed were far higher than could be justified. It argued that the amount of USD1,035,814 for the fees of LECG were grossly excessive especially when \"Claimants\u2019 counsel knew full well that they were advancing a reckless over-extensive DCF analysis to a set of facts for which it was not manifestly suited.\"\n\n611.\n\nAs to the legal fees, Egypt submitted that they were unreasonable on the basis of the test of proportionality. It pointed out the total cost that Egypt\u2019s counsel sought was less than one-half of the USD 8,411,491.72 sought by the Claimants\u2019 counsel.\n\n612.\n\nTurning to Egypt\u2019s own claim for costs: it claimed USD 4,112,673.24, which was made up as follows :\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **APPENDIX** **No.** | **Summary of Respondent\u2019s Fees and Expenses** | **Total (USD)** |\n| 1 | **Attorney\u2019s Fees and Expenses** **A.** Baker & McKenzie \"Cairo Office\" Helmy Hamza & Partners | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Value of time | | | | $642,110.63 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Other costs **B.** Baker & McKenzie \"New York Office\" | $75,421.39 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Value of time | | | | $1,335,550.20 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Other costs **C.** Dr. Ahmed Kamal Aboulmagd | $86,174.56 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Value of time | | | | $90,000 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Other costs **D.** Egyptian State Lawsuit Authority | $15,150.8 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Value of time | | | | $9,846.46 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Other costs | 4,949.7 |\n| 2 | **Experts Fees and Expenses** | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Dr. Hafiza El Hadad | $15000 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Dr. Saeed El Dakak | $7500 | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Dr. Okasha Abd Elaal | $7500 | |\n| 3 | Nadeem Souhaid | $17,975 |\n| 4 | Straight Line Hospitality Corporation | $159,651.77 |\n| 5 | Abd El Hafiz Ghalyini | $22,533 |\n| 6 | Hans Smit | $108,509.55 |\n| 7 | Ivan Shearer | $11,200 |\n| 8 | EMA Office | $8,855 |\n| 9 | Karim Hafez | $125,408.12 |\n| 10 | KPMG L.L.P | $529,763.57 |\n| 11 | KPMG Egypt | $87,041.94 |\n| 12 | Euro-Asia Consulting | $97,694.26 |\n| 13 | Trevor McGowan | $5,614.05 |\n| 14 | **Travel Costs and Expenses** | $149,223.24 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | **ICSID Advances Paid** | $500,000 |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Total | $4,112,673.24 |\n\n**Relevant principles as to costs**\n-----------------------------------\n\n613.\n\nThe relevant legal provisions which provide the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the issues related to costs in these proceedings are Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 28(1)(b) of the ICSID Rules.\n\n614.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses on the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\"\n\n615.\n\nRule 28(1) of the ICSID Rules provides:\n\n\"(1) Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the costs of the proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide:\n\n(a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre;\n\n(b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties.\"\n\n616.\n\nAs to the apportionment of costs, the Tribunal has drawn useful guidance from the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention, which indicate that the wording chosen for Article 61(2) was specifically designed to allow the Tribunal to make the decision on the assessment of costs (as opposed to the wording which had initially been included in the Preliminary Draft and the First Draft, which embodied the principle that each party to arbitration should bear its own expenses and that the charges of the Centre as well as the fees of the tribunal should be borne equally by the parties).776 The Tribunal also notes Professor Schreuer\u2019s comment that \"neither the Convention nor the attendant Rules and Regulations offer substantive criteria for the tribunals\u2019 decision on which party should bear the costs. Possible principles are the equal sharing of costs, the \"loser pays\" maxim, or the use of costs as a sanction for procedural misconduct.\"777\n\nSchreuer, *supra* note 162, p. 1224.\n\nIbid.\n\n617.\n\nIn coming to its decision on costs, the Tribunal has also taken due note of the decisions made by previous ICSID Tribunals, in light of which it appears that the practice of such Tribunals has not been uniform and that the present Tribunal therefore has a broad discretion to apportion costs.778 In this respect, the Tribunal has derived assistance from the method adopted by the Arbitral Tribunal in *Plama Consortium Limited v Republic of Bulgaria.779*\n\nSee, *e.g.,* *SPP v Egypt,* Award and Dissenting Opinion of 20 May 1992, 3 ICSID Reports 189; *MINE v Guinea,* Award of 6 January 1988, 4 ICSID Reports 61; *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. v. Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Award of 27 June 1990; *Wena Hotel Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award of 8 December 2000.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award of 27 August 2008.\n\n618.\n\nIn the *Plama* case, the Tribunal held that:\n\n\"Article 61 of the ICSID Convention gives the Arbitral Tribunal the discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the parties as it deems appropriate. In the exercise of this discretion, the Arbitral Tribunal will apply the principle that \"costs follow the event,\" by a weighing of relative success or failure, that is to say, the loser pays costs including reasonable legal and other costs of the prevailing party; or costs are allocated proportionally to the outcome of the case....\"\n\n619.\n\nFurther, in *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v The Republic of Hungary,* the Tribunal stated on the issue of costs:\n\n\"... the Tribunal can find no reason to depart from the starting point that the successful party should receive reimbursement from the unsuccessful party. This was a complex, difficult, important and lengthy arbitration which clearly justified experienced and expert legal representation as well as the engagement of top quality experts on quantum. The Tribunal is not surprised at the total of the costs incurred by the Claimants. Members of the Tribunal have considerable experience of substantial ICSID cases as well as commercial cases and the amount expended is certainly within the expected range. Were the Claimants not to be reimbursed their costs in justifying what they alleged to be egregious conduct on the part of Hungary it could not be said that they were being made whole.\"780\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award of 2 October 2006, p. 101.\n\n**Discussion**\n--------------\n\n620.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered all submissions as to costs made by the parties including Egypt\u2019s contentions that the Claimants had not provided adequate substantiation of their actual legal fees and that their costs application was \"unjustified and excessive.\"\n\n621.\n\nHaving considered all of this material the Tribunal finds that it is appropriate in this case for the losing party to bear the reasonable costs of the successful party in these proceedings. The Claimants have succeeded on the merits and Egypt\u2019s objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal were rejected in their totality, both at the jurisdictional phase and during the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the merits. All of Egypt\u2019s defences on the merits have been dismissed. Moreover, in view of the repeated and belated re-formulated jurisdictional arguments advanced by Egypt, all of which have failed, the Tribunal is of the opinion that Egypt was responsible for greatly increasing the costs of these proceedings.\n\n622.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the Claimants should be compensated for their reasonable legal fees and related expenses in respect of both the original jurisdictional phase and subsequent phases.\n\n623.\n\nIt now falls to the Tribunal to determine the reasonableness of the amount of Claimants\u2019 legal fees and related expenses.\n\n624.\n\nAs a preliminary point, this Tribunal agrees with the observation made in the *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v The Republic of Hungary* case, where the Tribunal rejected the submission \"that the reasonableness of the quantum of the Claimants\u2019 claim for costs should be judged by the amount expended by the Respondent.\" This Tribunal further agrees that \"it is not unusual for claimants to spend more on costs than respondents given, among other things, the burden of proof.\"781\n\nIbid., at p. 102.\n\n625.\n\nAs regards the legal costs sought by the Claimants, the Tribunal is satisfied that the amount sought by the Claimants for its legal costs is in line with the level of fees normally charged by a major international law firm in a case of this kind involving many complex issues and a number of procedural phases. These costs are not, therefore, unreasonable. The fact that the attorney\u2019s fees presented by Egypt are significantly less than those sought by the Claimants does not of itself demonstrate that the fees charged by counsel for the Claimants are unreasonable.\n\n626.\n\nWith regard to the costs of the Claimant\u2019s experts, the Tribunal recalls that it has accepted Egypt\u2019s submission that the DCF analysis presented by the Claimants\u2019 expert, LECG, was an insufficiently certain basis upon which to calculate damages in the present case. As such, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to grant any recovery of LECG\u2019s fees, particularly in light of the Claimants\u2019 pursuit of its alternative approach to the quantum of damages which has been upheld by the Tribunal. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that some of the legal fees would have been expended in briefing the LECG witness. In making this ruling, the Tribunal intends no disrespect to LECG since the relative paucity of baseline information made its task a difficult one.\n\n627.\n\nHowever, as regards the Claimants\u2019 other experts, the Tribunal finds that the costs sought are reasonable. In its consideration of this issue, the Tribunal has taken into account the well known observations of Judge Holtzmann:\n\n\"Nor should the Tribunal neglect to consider the reality that legal bills are usually first submitted to businessmen. The pragmatic fact that a businessman has agreed to pay a bill, not knowing whether or not the Tribunal would reimburse the expenses, is a strong indication that the amount billed was considered reasonable by a reasonable man spending his own money, or the money of the corporation he serves. That is a classic test of reasonableness.\"782\n\nSeparate opinion of Judge Holtzmann, at p. 7; reported in Iranian Assets Litigation Reporter 10, 860, 10, 863; 8 Iran-US C.T.R. 329, 332-333.\n\n628.\n\nThe Claimants have confirmed that the fees of their experts have been paid in full. In light of the foregoing reasons and having given due weight to the complexity of the issues on which expert evidence was required, the Tribunal is of the view that the experts\u2019 fees were reasonably incurred and also reasonable as to the amount.\n\n629.\n\nFinally, in coming to its decision on the allocation of costs, the Tribunal has also noted that Egypt has made a number of unsuccessful jurisdictional objections, some of which were filed late in the course of proceedings and which represented in modified form issues which had already been decided by the Tribunal.\n\n630.\n\nIn consideration of the above and taking into account all the circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal concludes that it would be appropriate, in the exercise of its discretion, to order Egypt to pay the Claimants the sum of USD 6,000,000 as a reasonable contribution towards their reasonable costs and expenses in this arbitration. This figure starts with the total amount claimed and deducts the LECG fee and a sum which reflects an approximation of the legal costs likely to have been incurred in briefing LECG.\n\n**X.
