I believe that, in view of their consequences, the measures applied to the firm are tantamount to an expropriation, even though the Congolese authorities may have acted legally or did not intentionally seek the effects produced.\n\n5.\n\nIf I do not agree with the Award, it is because, in my opinion, the Tribunal has not provided appropriate responses to the other two points argued by the parties:\n\n- *the investment required for the dispute to be within the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal (A);*\n\n- *the bases for evaluation of the compensation claimed by Mr. Patrick Mitchell (B).*\n\n**A. CONCERNING THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED FOR THE DISPUTE TO BE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe evaluation of the investment required for the dispute to be within the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal was strongly influenced by the fact that the parties placed more emphasis in their debate on the **form** than on the **content** of the notion of investment.\n\n7.\n\nIn refusing to recognize the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, the DRC relied exclusively on the ground that ***the activity as an attorney or legal counsel does not qualify as an investment***  without taking into account the elements alleged by the Claimant as being investments.\n\n8.\n\nThe DRC contends, among other things, that the activity as an attorney or legal counsel does not qualify as a service within the meaning of Article I (c) of the BIT which provides a definition of the term investment. It also argues that the license to operate delivered to the Claimant is not in conformity with the Congolese Investment Code. It contends, moreover, that the profession of attorney-at-law or legal counsel is not considered as a commercial activity falling under the scope of the BIT.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal is correct in rejecting the various facets of the argument. I should simply like to note that I do not understand why the Tribunal insisted on including among the grounds for the Award that it \" *does not have to examine, in relation to the question of its jurisdiction, whether Mr. Mitchell's firm had or did not have the permission to perform activities as attorney-at-law or legal consultant\"* (Award, para. 51). It could have omitted these grounds, especially since it responded immediately thereafter to the concern expressed by the DRC. In reality, I find it surprising that the Tribunal implies that the Claimant could have set up business in the host country without conforming to the regulations and administrative procedures referred to in Articles II (9) and IX (a) of the BIT.\n\n10.\n\nThat being said, I agree with the decision that the activity as an attorney or legal counsel may serve as a framework for an investment justifying the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\n*But can one go so far as to say that the activity as an attorney or legal counsel constitutes in itself an investment as defined in the BIT and the ICSID Convention* (Award, paras. 52 and 53)?\n\n*Likewise, I wonder if it is possible to qualify as an investment justifying the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal:*\n\n- *the service contracts by which Mr. Patrick Mitchell provided legal assistance to his clients (Award: paras. 46 and 48);*\n\n- *the goodwill of the Claimant (para. 48);*\n\n- *the payments registered on his accounts in the United States of America (para.* *48);*\n\n- *the right to exercise the activity of legal counsel (para. 48).*\n\n12.\n\nFollowing the exchanges of views on these various issues, the Tribunal concluded that ***\"...the resources and activities related to this firm [Patrick Mitchell] qualify as an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT\" (para. 57).***\n\n13.\n\nI do not share this opinion. The Tribunal, in my view, is mistaken.\n\n14.\n\nIt is true that contracts for legal assistance and the other activities referred to in the Award as constituting an investment are protected by the BIT. But Article II (2), which provides for such protection, took care to designate the activities in question by a specific term, **\"associated activities**,\" to mark their difference from the notion of **\"investment**.\" The nuance is not accidental. Nor is it by chance that the Treaty refers to \"investment activities,\" not in Article I (c) concerning the definition of investment, but in Article II, devoted to the treatment of investments. Although they benefit from the same protection, the two notions are distinct.\n\n15.\n\nInsofar as the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is dependent solely on the evidence of an investment, the Tribunal should base its analysis on this notion. Once the required investment has been established, the protection thereof rightfully extends to associated activities and products, such as goodwill, service contracts, and fees.\n\nThis list of elements protected by the Treaty must be taken into account in applying the notions of expropriation and compensation.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal was thus erroneous in its belief that it would attain the same result by qualifying as an \"investment\" *activities associated with investments.*\n\n17.\n\nBesides, I do not think that the flexibility of the notion of investment can be used to cover every **service** referred to in Article I (c) of the BIT. A service, just like property, receivables, debt or any other element referred to in Article I (c) of the BIT, may not be qualified as an investment unless it is involved in a production process. **\"Goods or services invested\"** cannot be confused with **\"goods or services produced**.\" In the present instance, the services provided to third parties by the Claimant in the DRC and fees billed or returned for consideration are products of investment. It could be otherwise only if these fees were reinvested. Then they would constitute an investment within the meaning of Article I (c) (vii) of the Treaty.\n\n18.\n\nLikewise, ordinary goodwill is the result of investment, not an element of investment. This is the case under the Treaty. It is also true under Congolese law, and in general in countries with a French legal tradition. In all these countries, goodwill is not included among the elements of investment. The only exception is the case of transfer of goodwill, where the transferee acquires a right of non-competition vis-\u00e0-vis the transferor; this right may be qualified as an investment in terms of the intellectual and industrial property rights referred to in Article I (c) (iv) of the BIT. This exception does not apply in the present instance, since the Claimant has not proved that the transfer of assets agreement he signed on March 31, 1991 with his former associates included a transfer of goodwill clause.\n\n19.\n\nI have also wondered how the Tribunal could have speculated on the flexibility of the notion of investment to the point of extending its application to income registered by Patrick Mitchell in his accounts in the United States of America and in the Republic of South Africa, without concerning itself with the scope of coverage of the BIT.\n\n20.\n\nIn reality, the only investment to which Mr. Patrick Mitchell referred in his supplementary memorial of October 11, 2001, under heading G (points 39-51), is constituted by the assets he acquired by the transfer of assets agreement he signed on March 31, 1991 with his former partners, [...]. He did not mention goodwill, legal assistance contracts or fees in the abovementioned memorial except under the heading of compensation. Thus, unlike the Tribunal, the Claimant did not extend the notion of investment to associated activities.\n\n21.\n\nBut now we come to the heart of the matter: why did the Tribunal combine the two notions? Is it because it felt that the investment as established by the BIT and the ICSID convention would not be significant enough to justify the Tribunal's jurisdiction? I had personally thought at one stage of the Tribunal's exchanges that the assets acquired by the Claimant as a result of the transfer of assets agreement of March 31, 1991 might justify the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. But I came to understand as I listened to the Tribunal that we ran the risk of being inconsistent if we qualified as an investment the movable property, files, records, and other documents present in the office at the time of the seizure. Actually, if proper care is not taken, Mr. Patrick Mitchell could ultimately take advantage of his authorization to practice the profession of legal counsel in order to claim entitlement to argue before the ICSID Tribunal. This would open the door to countless abuses.\n\n22.\n\nWe must thus avoid confusion in applying the notion of investment. It is one thing to invest, and another to \"practice activities.\"\n\n23.\n\nBy confusing \"investment\" with \"associated activities,\" the Tribunal has given an inappropriate response to the objection to its jurisdiction, wrongly basing itself on the volume of Mr. Patrick Mitchell's activities in order to maintain that in this case there was an investment within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. CONCERNING THE BASES FOR EVALUATION OF COMPENSATION CLAIMED BY MR. PATRICK MITCHELL**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal was asked to respond to the question of whether it was necessary, in determining the compensation claimed by Mr. Patrick Mitchell, to take into account only the fair market value of his office in the DRC, or if the value of his other two offices in the United States of America and in the Republic of South Africa should also be included.\n\n25.\n\nIt decided to take into account the value of the three offices, because \" *[o]n the basis of the* *statements of income and the billings filed as evidence of such income, the Tribunal is satisfied that the incomes referred to in these statements are related to services provided by the Claimant's firm in the DRC. The clients to whom these billings were addressed were seeking and have been provided with services of the firm in the Congo. The fact that most payments were addressed to* *Mr. Mitchell's office in the USA does in no way imply that the office in the DRC did act as a mere sub-contractor* \" (Award, para. 80).\n\n26.\n\nI dissociated myself with the Tribunal's reasoning because I found it shocking.\n\n27.\n\nIn clarification of my opinion, I should like to note that no one disputes the fact that Patrick Mitchell's office in the DRC is legally distinct from his offices in the other two countries, and that it has its own local clientele and operating account.\n\n28.\n\nIt is also agreed that, in respect of the clients living abroad on whose behalf the DRC office acted at the request of the offices in the USA and RSA, it was the latter which billed and collected the fees.\n\nContrary to the views expressed in the Award, it is undeniable that, for the clients abroad, the Kinshasa office provided services merely as a sub-contractor acting on behalf of the offices in USA and RSA. Furthermore, by every indication, the funds transferred to the DRC office by the offices in the USA and RSA were re-transfers of fees in consideration for the services thus provided. The re-transferred fees plus the internal income constitute, in my view, the only income that can be compared with expenses in determining the income statement for the operation of the Kinshasa office. The \"capitalized earnings approach\" used by the Tribunal to determine the market value of the \"investment\" allegedly expropriated from Mr. Patrick Mitchell must be applied to this last-mentioned income statement.\n\n29.\n\nWhy  did the Tribunal choose to base itself on the consolidated revenue of the three offices? It would certainly not have done so if the income accrued by the Kinshasa office for the fiscal year 1998 had been substantial.\n\n30.\n\nAs it happens, for the fiscal year 1998 the operating account of the DRC office showed a deficit of US$ [...]; billings filed and expenses paid amounted respectively to US$ [...]. This statement certainly had some influence on the position taken by the Tribunal.\n\n31.\n\nAs it was necessary to hand down a sentence, there could have been another way of circumventing the problem. The Tribunal could have combined the capital earnings approach with a method that would determine the net assets of the office on the date of the actions of which the Congolese authorities are accused. The Tribunal could merely have invited the Claimant to provide it with appropriate information on the firm's assets and liabilities; he had not yet done so, since the only element of evidence available to the Tribunal was the agreement which he had signed in 1991 with his partners to transfer a modest amount of assets. This step would have at least enlightened the Tribunal on the investments associated with the premises housing his firm in the DRC and all the other property he acquired subsequent to 31 March 1991.\n\n32.\n\nI do not understand why the Tribunal ruled out this action, which I proposed, and instead chose to follow the reasoning by which the offices in the USA and DRC were merely billing and collection offices for services provided by the DRC office.\n\n33.\n\nThis move by the Tribunal first of all violates the scope of application of the BIT of August 28, 1984. The Treaty can only cover Patrick Mitchell's office in the DRC. Its effects cannot be extended to offices opened by the Claimant in other countries.\n\n34.\n\nSecondly, the action will have serious consequences in that it constitutes an open and inadmissible means of supporting a mechanism invented by Mr. Patrick Mitchell to illegally transfer abroad the income generated by his office in the DRC.\n\n35.\n\nIf Article V (1) (a) of the Bilateral Treaty of August 28, 1984 guarantees Mr. Patrick Mitchell the free transfer of his returns in the DRC, it is on the express condition that he conform with the prescribed procedures in Congolese law and that he pay income taxes (Article V (3)).\n\n36.\n\nHowever, by his method of billing and collecting fees abroad, Mr. Patrick Mitchell has, over the years, shielded the bulk of his revenues from the application of these regulations.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot close its eyes to such practices without betraying the objectives of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n38.\n\nIt is legally and morally unacceptable for Mr. Patrick Mitchell to be demanding with respect to the provisions of the BIT that favor him while his own behavior is detrimental to the development of the host country.\n\nThe Tribunal should not, in my view, consider granting compensation for any alleged prejudice to income that was illegally transferred abroad at the expense of the DRC.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n--------------\n\n39.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, I believe that it is contrary to law and justice that the Tribunal is not only granting to Mr. Patrick Mitchell the amount of US$ 750,000, plus interest at an annual rate of 7.75%, but is further sentencing the DRC to pay US$ 95,000 as a contribution to the Claimant's costs, expenses and counsel fees, including his share of the costs incurred by ICSID.\n\n40.\n\nFor these reasons I abstained from signing the Award."}], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n**I. The Proceeding**\n---------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 6 October 1999 the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter \"ICSID\" of the \"Centre\") received a Request for arbitration on behalf of Mr. Patrick H. Mitchell (hereinafter \"Mr. Mitchell\" or \"Claimant\") against the Democratic Republic of Congo (hereinafter also \"Congo\", \"DRC\" or \"Respondent\"). This Request referred to the seizure by Congolese military forces, on March 5, 1999, of the premises of Mr. Mitchell's legal consulting firm and to the consequences of that seizure. The Request asked the Arbitral Tribunal to issue a final award\n\n\"a) Declaring that the DRC has, in violation of the USA/DRC Bilateral Investment Treaty, Congolese law, and international law, expropriated the assets of Mr. Mitchell;\n\nb) Requiring the DRC to compensate Mr. Mitchell for all damages suffered by Mr. Mitchell as a result of DRC's actions; and\n\nc) Granting to Mr. Mitchell all of the costs incurred by him in undertaking this arbitration, including the arbitrators' fees, the fees of any experts, the legal costs incurred by Mr. Mitchell, and any administrative costs.\"\n\n2.\n\nThe Request for arbitration was supplemented on behalf of Mr. Mitchell by letters of November 3, 12 and 22, 1999 and of December 6 and 7, 1999, and was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on December 10, 1999.\n\n3.\n\nThe Request refers to Article VII of the Bilateral Treaty concluded on August 3, 1984 between the Republic of Za\u00efre and the United States of America concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments (hereinafter \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\"), which provides, in relevant part, under paragraph 4, as follows:\n\n\"4. (a) The national or company concerned may consent in writing to submit the dispute to the Centre or the Additional Facility for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration.\n\n(b) Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may institute proceedings before the Centre or Additional Facility at any time after six months from the date upon which the dispute arose, provided,\n\n(i) the dispute has not, for any reason, been submitted by the national or company for resolution in accordance with any applicable dispute settlement procedures previously approved by the parties to the dispute; and\n\n(ii) the national or company concerned has not brought the dispute before the courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Party that is a party to the dispute.\"1\n\nPrior to the registration of the Request, by letters dated December 6 and 7, 1999 Mr. Mitchell had confirmed that he was not actually, and had not been on the date of the Request for arbitration, a national of the Democratic Republic of Congo and that he satisfied the requirements set out in Article VII (4)(b)(i) and (ii) of the BIT.\n\nThe English version of the BIT, as provided by Claimant, is a copy of the document submitted to the Senate by the President of the United States on February 26, 1984.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent not having responded to Claimant's proposal to submit the dispute to a sole arbitrator selected by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID, by letter of March 10, 2000 and in accordance with Arbitration Rule 2(3), Claimant informed the Secretary-General of ICSID of his choice of the formula provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention (hereinafter the \"Convention\") concerning the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. As a result, the Tribunal was to consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each Party and the third, the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. Pursuant to Arbitration Rule 3(1), Claimant designated Mr. Willard Z. Estey, a national of Canada, to act as the Claimant's appointee to the Tribunal.\n\n5.\n\nThe arbitrator appointed by Respondent by letter dated May 10, 2000 declined to accept such appointment. The Respondent did not concur in the appointment of the arbitrator proposed by Claimant to be the President of the Tribunal, nor did it appoint another arbitrator.\n\n6.\n\nActing upon a request made by Claimant by letter of October 11, 2000 and in accordance with Article 38 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 4, the Acting Chairman of the Administrative Council appointed Mr. Yawovi Agboyibo as the second arbitrator and Professor Andreas Bucher as the third and presiding arbitrator of the Arbitral Tribunal. Both Parties expressed their acceptance of the appointment of these arbitrators.\n\n7.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Tribunal was deemed to be constituted and the proceeding to have begun on November 21, 2000, when all three arbitrators had accepted their appointment. Ms. Gabriela Alvarez-Avila was designated as the Secretary of the Tribunal. She was replaced by Ms. Martina Polasek as from August 2002.\n\n8.\n\nOn January 15, 2001, the Tribunal held its first session with the Parties at the seat of ICSID in Washington, D.C. At that session, the Parties acknowledged that the Tribunal had been properly constituted. It was decided that the languages of the proceeding would be English and French. The pleadings submitted by the Parties would be in one of these languages and accompanied by a translation into the other language. The latter requirement would not apply to annexes of the pleadings and to witness statements.\n\n9.\n\nAt the same session, it was decided that Claimant would file his memorial on the merits (including translation) no later than March 28, 2001, and that Respondent would file its counter-memorial (including translation) no later than July 13, 2001.\n\n10.\n\nClaimant's memorial was filed on March 28, 2001. It repeats the conclusions contained in the Request for arbitration (see paragraph 1), but adds that the compensation sought from Respondent is \"in an amount no less than US$ [...] plus interest\".\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent did not file its counter-memorial at the date initially fixed. On July 26, 2001, it requested the time limit to be extended citing a change at the head of the Ministry of justice. The President of the Tribunal acceded to this request and extended the time limit to September 10, 2001. Respondent's counter-memorial, dated September 3, 2001, was filed on September 17, 2001.\n\n12.\n\nIn its counter-memorial of September 3, 2001, Respondent requested the Tribunal to decide:\n\n\" *Mainly* : that the ICSID is materially unqualified to know about a litigation which does not relate to \"an investment\";\n\n*Subsidiarily* as for the meaning [sic]: there has never been any expropriation, in the absence of constitutive elements and evidence;\n\nSince then, the request of M. MITCHELL is not justified and is obviously rash and vexatious;\n\nConsequently, the DRC postulates for the counter claim, the conviction of the petitioner to pay him damages for all prejudice that this case caused, i.e.:\n\n- justice expenses, lawyers' honoraria and experts fees (reserved while waiting for the end of process),\n\n- and for attack to the good reputation to the DRC: [\u2026] $ US.\"\n\n(Translation supplied by Respondent.)\n\n13.\n\nRespondent having thus raised for the first time in its counter-memorial of September 3, 2001 an objection to the Tribunal's competence, as is possible under Arbitration Rule 41(1), the President of the Tribunal, after consultation with the other members of the Tribunal, decided to suspend the proceeding on the merits pursuant to Article 41 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 41(3) and (4). In reply to a request from Claimant for a time limit of four months to be set for his counter-memorial on jurisdiction, the President, after consultation with the other members of the Tribunal, extended this limit to February 8, 2002.\n\n14.\n\nOn January 29, 2002, all concerned learned with deep regret that Mr. Willard Z. Estey, the arbitrator appointed by Claimant, had passed away on January 25, 2002. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 10(2), the proceeding was suspended until the vacancy on the Tribunal was filled. On February 13, 2002, the Tribunal was reconstituted and the proceedings were resumed when Mr. Marc Lalonde, a national of Canada, accepted his appointment as an arbitrator designated by Claimant pursuant to Arbitration Rule 11(1).\n\n15.\n\nClaimant's counter-memorial on jurisdiction, dated February 4, 2002, was received by the Centre on February 7, 2002.\n\n16.\n\nHaving consulted with the Parties, the Tribunal decided to ask the Parties to file a second exchange of pleadings on jurisdiction, giving thereby the Parties the option to exhaust the subject in writing, thus avoiding an oral hearing on the question of jurisdiction, unless later considered necessary by the Tribunal. The President fixed the time limit for the submission of Respondent's memorial in reply to be April 15, 2002. This memorial, dated April 8, 2002, was filed with ICSID on April 19, 2002. As he was invited to do, Claimant submitted to ICSID his rejoinder, dated May 24, 2002, on May 29, 2002.\n\n17.\n\nUpon receipt and examination of all these written pleadings, the Tribunal came to the view that it had not received sufficient evidence concerning the investments made by the Claimant in the DRC. As stated in Procedural Order No. 1 of July 11, 2002, the Tribunal, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4), decided to join the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction to the merits. The Tribunal therefore invited the Claimant to file, by October 11, 2002, any complementary observations that he wished to make on his memorial of March 29, 2001 and, in particular, to produce any relevant additional evidence in support of his claim, including all pertinent documents concerning the valuation of \"Mitchell & Associates\" and the relief claimed. Respondent was granted three months to file its response. Claimant's Reply, dated October 11, 2002, was received by the Centre on October 16, 2002. The Counter-memorial in reply of the Respondent, dated January 7, 2003, was received by the Centre by electronic mail on January 15, 2003, and by ordinary mail on January 31, 2003. Respondent indicated in this brief that it claimed an amount of US$ [\u2026] as damages for attacking its reputation and for the costs incurred in this litigation.\n\n18.\n\nBy its Procedural Order No. 2 of January 17, 2003, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to file a rejoinder to the Respondent's last brief. It provided also for a rebuttal pleading to be filed by Respondent. In a letter dated January 21, 2003, Claimant declared that he did not consider it necessary or appropriate to file a further pleading. He also stated that, having presented his case by way of affidavits, he did not consider necessary to present his case at a hearing at which witnesses and experts would be examined. In reaction to this statement, the Respondent declared in its letter dated February 4, 2003, that under the circumstances it had no further remarks to make, and that in the absence of any pleading from its opponent, it did not wish to plead its case alone at a hearing. In a letter dated February 27, 2003, Claimant further confirmed that he would prefer the matter to be decided on the basis of the affidavits; he declared, however, to be prepared to participate in a hearing in the event the Tribunal considered oral evidence as necessary in relation to any specific issues.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that it did not need to hear the Parties' pleadings. By letter of March 10, 2003, it submitted to the Parties several questions in order to better understand certain aspects of the dispute. The Claimant's reply to the questions raised by the Tribunal, dated May 22, 2003, was received by the Centre on May 27, 2003. The Respondent's answer to the questions of the Arbitral Tribunal, dated April 21, 2003, was filed on May 2, 2003. Claimant commented on the Respondent's answers on May 22, 2003 and Respondent did so with regard to Claimant's reply on June 9, 2003. In response to the question raised by the President of the Tribunal whether, in the light of this exchange of briefs, an oral hearing was requested, Respondent stated by an e-mail of June 19, 2003 that it had nothing further to say nor to add to its previous declarations. The Claimant confirmed by letter of June 25, 2003 that it did not consider it necessary to present oral evidence. In response to the Tribunal's further query in respect of the relevant interest rate at March 5, 1999, Claimant answered by a second letter of June 25, 2003 that the rate was 7.75%. This letter was commented upon by Respondent in its letter dated August 22, 2003. Claimant's Counsel filed on September 11, 2003 additional comments prepared by Mr. Mitchell in reply to this letter of Respondent. In the mean time, the Tribunal had invited Claimant, by letter of August 14, 2003, to further explain some of his answers given to the questions raised in the Tribunal's letter of March 10, 2003. Claimant's reply to this letter was given on September 5, 2003. By letter of September 19, 2003, Respondent sent its observations to Claimant's remarks contained in his letters of September 5 and 11, 2003.\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal met for a deliberation in Paris on October 15 and 16, 2003.\n\n21.\n\nBy a letter dated January 13, 2004, the Parties were informed that the proceeding was closed. Each Party submitted a statement of costs incurred or borne by it in this proceeding. In his reply to Respondent's answers to the Tribunal's letter of March 10, 2003, Claimant requested to be awarded an additional amount of US$ 530,000.00 to cover the costs of Claimant's counsel in the event the award would be in his favour, this amount being payable by Respondent in case it would not pay the amount of the award within the time provided for by the Tribunal.\n\n22.\n\nIn conformity with the choice of two languages applicable to this proceeding, this award has been drafted in English and in French.\n\n**II. The source of the dispute**\n---------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n31.\n\nThe dispute brought by Claimant via the Centre before this Tribunal raises basically the question whether the measures taken by the Government of the DRC in respect of Mr. Mitchell's firm constituted an expropriation relating to an investment of Mr. Mitchell in the DRC and, in the affirmative, whether Claimant is entitled to be indemnified by Respondent. In Respondent's view, however, this dispute does not come under the jurisdiction of ICSID or this Tribunal's competence. This challenge of the Tribunal's competence has to be examined first.\n\n**B. The Arbitral Tribunal's Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal is asked to decide whether Claimant's Request for arbitration comes under the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Tribunal. It is not disputed that both Parties validly expressed their consent to ICSID arbitration, as provided for in Article VII of the Bilateral Investment Treaty concluded between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States of America. As Respondent has stated, its objection to jurisdiction is solely one to the qualification of Claimant's activity in the Congo as an investment.\n\n33.\n\nIt is further argued by Respondent that under Article III(3) of the BIT, Claimant was required to submit his request first to the competent judicial or administrative authority in the DRC. By not having done so, the claim could not be brought before this Tribunal. However, this is manifestly not what results from the provision referred to. Under that rule, indeed, the recourse to state authorities is a right, but not an obligation of the investor, who is free to have direct recourse to the mechanism provided for in Article VII of the BIT for the settlement of disputes.\n\n**I. The position of the Parties**\n----------------------------------\n\n1. *The Respondent*\n-------------------\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*2. The Claimant*\n-----------------\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**II. Analysis by the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nIn considering the objection raised by the Democratic Republic of the Congo and directed against the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Tribunal's competence in this case, the Tribunal must begin with considering whether the dispute in the instant case arises directly out of an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n41.\n\nIt is well known that the Convention does not define the term \"investment\" and that various proposals made during the negotiations in that regard failed. This is reflected in the Report of the Executive Directors in the following words:\n\n\"27. No attempt was made to define the term \"investment\" given the essential requirement of consent by the parties, and the mechanism through which Contracting States can make known in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider submitting to the Centre (Article 25[4]).\" (1 ICSID Reports 28; ICSID Convention, Regulations and Rules, ICSID/15/Rev.1, Washington 2003, p. 44)\n\n42.\n\nThis statement indicates that the authors of the Convention have chosen a broad approach to the concept of investment. As noted during the drafting of the Convention, a Contracting State that prefers to limit the scope of the Centre's jurisdiction can do so by making the declaration provided for in Article 25(4) of the Convention. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has not made such a declaration and has, therefore, accepted the broad scope of the subject matter jurisdiction governed by the Convention.\n\n43.\n\nAs indicated in the statement quoted above, an important factor in determining whether a dispute qualifies as an investment dispute under the Convention is the consent given by the Parties. The State Parties' consent to submit a certain category of disputes to the Centre's jurisdiction does contain the determination that such disputes are to be considered as related to investments within the meaning of the ICSID Convention. Even if, in a particular case, a dispute arises out of an investment within the meaning of the Convention, one must further examine, however, whether such a dispute relates to an investment as defined in the Parties' consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal must accordingly look with particular care at the definition of the notion of investment given in the Bilateral Investment Treaty concluded between the Congo and the United States (BIT). This Treaty contains in Article VII the expression of these States' consent to the ICSID arbitration mechanism.\n\n45.\n\nIn support of its conclusion that the firm of Mr. Mitchell, including its assets and business prospectives, qualifies as an investment under the BIT, Claimant refers to Article 1, letter (c), which reads as follows:\n\n\"For the purposes of this Treaty,\n\n(c) \u2018investment' means every kind of investment, owned or controlled directly or indirectly, including equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:\n\n(i) tangible and intangible property, including all property rights, such as liens, mortgages pledges, and real security;\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;\n\n(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;\n\n(iv) intellectual and industrial property rights, including rights with respect to copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade names, industrial designs, trade secrets and know-how, and goodwill;\n\n(v) licenses and permits issued pursuant to law, including those issued for manufacture and sale of products;\n\n(vi) any right conferred by law or contract, including rights to search for or utilize natural resources, and rights to manufacture, use and sell products; and\n\n(vii) returns which are reinvested.\n\nAny alteration of the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect their character as investment.\"\n\n46.\n\nOne striking feature of this definition is the fact that all items listed in this provision are mentioned for illustrative purposes. They do not have the effect of restricting in any manner the notion of an investment and the scope of the subject matter of the BIT. Indeed, as stated expressly in the introductory part of this provision, \"\u2018investment' means every kind of investment, owned or controlled directly or indirectly\". Anything that follows in the definition quoted above is included in this concept. This has not the effect, however, of excluding items which may qualify as an investment while they may not be included in any of the items listed. In addition to Article I, the BIT contains in Article II, dealing with \"treatment of investment\", a list of \"associated activities\", that are to be treated like investments and include, *inter alia*, \"the making, performance and enforcement of contracts\" (paragraph 2, letter c).\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal has received ample information about the activities exercised by Mr. Mitchell in the DRC, which allow to answer the question concerning the existence of an investment of the Claimant in the DRC. These elements of information include in particular the declarations made by former clients of the firm, the agreements concluded with former associates who left the firm in 1991 and the income statements for the year 1996 to 1998.\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that in respect of items of Mr. Mitchell's property seized during the intervention of the military forces on March 5, 1999, the requirement listed under Article I(c)(i) of the BIT is met. This concerns movable property and any documents, like files, records and similar items. It further appears from the text of the provision as quoted that the investor's right to \"know-how\" and \"goodwill\" (iv) as well as the right to exercise its activities (vi) are elements which are stated as being covered by the protection of investments under the BIT. This concerns also the payments registered on the accounts of Mr. Mitchell in the United States to which Claimant refers in order to demonstrate his activity within the DRC. Indeed, these payments are based on bills for fees referring to legal consultations provided by Mr. Mitchell and his employees through the office \"Mitchell & Associates\" within the DRC.\n\n49.\n\nRespondent opposes in particular to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal the fact that, in its view, the activity of Mr. Mitchell's legal firm does not qualify as a \"service\" in respect of the BIT and Congolese law. These legal sources, in case of lack of an appropriate definition, would also have to be completed with the laws and usages of international commerce.\n\n50.\n\nOn this particular question, the Tribunal has to stress firstly that the definition of an investment, as a material element of the definition of the scope of the consent to arbitration contained in Article VII of the BIT, is contained in the text of the BIT, which may have to be completed by an appropriate interpretation of this instrument. Such a concept, like any other concept retained as a matter of international law in this agreement, cannot be determined on the basis of the domestic law of one of the Parties. The principle of interpretation to be applied is contained in paragraph 1 of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties of 1969, which reads as follows: \"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n51.\n\nAlthough it appears correct to state, as is done by the Respondent, that Mr. Mitchell's law firm does not qualify as an investment under the Congolese Investment Code, with regard to, in particular, the definitions contained in Articles 1, 4 and 7, this does by no means have the effect of excluding the assets and any other items connected with the firm from the notion of investment retained by the BIT. The same conclusion must apply to any other notion of \"service\" contained in other parts of Congolese domestic law. For this reason, the Tribunal does not have to examine, in relation to the question of its jurisdiction, whether Mr. Mitchell's firm had or did not have the permission to perform activities as attorney-at-law or legal consultant. The Tribunal notes, however, that according to the law on the organization of the profession of attorney-at-law of September 28, 1979, in addition to their exclusive right to represent clients before the Courts, attorneys are permitted to provide legal counseling to parties outside the judiciary context, but the same law does not stipulate that such an activity would be an exclusive privilege of attorneys, nor that it would require an authorization.\n\n52.\n\nWith regard to the notion of \"service contracts\" as contained in the introductory part of Article I(c) of the BIT, the Tribunal notes that this notion is not further defined in the Treaty and that the exceptions listed in the Annex on behalf of the Republic of Za\u00efre are not helpful in this respect. Similarly, the associated activities referred to in Article II, which include \"the making, performance and enforcement of contracts\", do not contain any element of restriction in respect of service contracts. Nor does the Treaty support the interpretation of the DRC according to which legal counseling and activities as attorney-at-law, in order to be included in the notion of service under the BIT, should have been affirmatively and expressly qualified as such in the Treaty. Such approach has not been chosen by the Contracting States to the BIT, neither in respect of legal services nor in respect of any other service. There does not exist either, as has been suggested by Respondent, a limitation of the scope of the BIT exclusively to commercial matters.\n\n53.\n\nIt appears therefore to the Tribunal that in the absence of any indication directing to the exclusion from the scope of the Treaty of particular activities that may be considered as services, such a concept should be given a broad meaning, covering all services provided by a foreign investor on the territory of the host State. In this respect, the concept of service is a notion proper to the BIT. There is no indication that such a concept should be interpreted in light of other agreements containing the notion of services, like those concluded within the GATT or the WTO, where such a notion is used for other purposes, different from those which were prevalent at the time of the signing of the BIT in 1984. Therefore, the services typically offered by a firm providing legal advice as did the Claimant's firm are covered by the notion of services used by the BIT.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that the matter of interpretation of the notion of \"service contracts\", as contained in Article I(c) of the BIT, is anyhow not determinative for the decision on the question of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Indeed, as the definition in the provision referred to states explicitly, the notion of \"service and investment contracts\" is used for purposes of illustration only. Under the BIT, the notion of investment means \"every kind of investment\". Article VII on consent to ICSID arbitration is equally broad in this respect, when it states the following:\n\n\"1. For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as a dispute involving\n\n(a)...\n\n(b)...\n\n(c) an alleged breach of any right confirmed or created by this\n\nTreaty with respect to an investment.\"\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal can draw from these elements of definition the conclusion that the BIT contains a definition of the notion of investment which is as broad as the concept is used in the ICSID Convention. In addition to movable property, Claimant transferred into the Congo money and other assets which constituted the foundations for his professional activities which came to an end the day of the seizure of his firm or soon thereafter. Together with the returns on the initial investments, which also qualify as investments (see Article I(c) of the BIT), these activities and the economic value associated therewith qualify as an investment within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that Claimant's activity does not qualify as an investment as it does not satisfy the objective requirements in this respect. Respondent mentions the fact that such activity does not constitute a long-term operation nor is it materialized by a significant contribution of resources, and that it is not of such importance for the State's economy that it distinguishes itself from an ordinary commercial transaction. The Tribunal notes, however, that these elements, while they are frequently present in investment projects, are not a formal requirement for the finding that a particular activity or transaction constitutes an investment. Such a concept, as long as it is not supplemented by the appropriate restrictions, does equally include, under the ICSID Convention, and, as demonstrated, under the BIT, \"smaller\" investments of shorter duration and with more limited benefit to the host State's economy.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, accordingly, that Mr. Mitchell's property detained in the Offices of Mitchell & Associates and the resources and activities related to this firm qualify as an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Therefore, the Tribunal decides that this dispute is within the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Tribunal.\n\n**C. The Merits of the Dispute**\n--------------------------------\n\n**I. The applicable provisions of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Investment Treaty concluded in 1984 between the United States of America and the Democratic Republic of Congo (\"Za\u00efre\" at that time) contains a number of provisions on the protection of investments that can be found in many other Treaties of this kind. Article II of this BIT is dealing with the \"Treatment of Investment\" and it provides under paragraph 4 as follows:\n\n\"Investments of nationals and companies of either Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy protection and security in the territory of the other Party. The treatment, protection and security of investment shall be in accordance with applicable national laws, and may not be less than that recognized by international law. Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary and discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investment made by nationals or companies of the other Party. Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investment of nationals or companies of the other Party.\"\n\n59.\n\nOne particular and important aspect of such protection of investments concerns the protection in case of measures of expropriation or nationalization. Article III of the BIT, under the heading \"Compensation for Expropriation\", provides in this respect, under paragraph 1, in its first part, the following:\n\n\"No investment or any part of an investment of a national or a company of either Party shall be expropriated or nationalized by the other Party or subjected to any other measure or series of measures, direct or indirect, tantamount to expropriation, unless the expropriation:\n\n(a) is done for a public purpose;\n\n(b) is accomplished under due process of law;\n\n(c) is not discriminatory;\n\n(d) does not violate any specific provision on contractual stability or expropriation contained in an investment agreement between the national or company concerned and the Party making the expropriation; and\n\n(e) is accompanied by prompt, adequate and effectively realizable compensation.\"\n\n60.\n\nAs the Parties to this dispute have not concluded an agreement in respect of the applicable law, the Tribunal, pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute and such rules of international law as may be applicable. The most prominent rules of international law applicable to investment disputes are the rules embodied in investment treaties to which the host State is a party. The BIT concluded in 1984 contains the rules of international law applicable to the merits of this dispute. As the DRC is a party to the BIT, the rules of this Treaty are equally to be considered as part of the law of the State party to this dispute.\n\n**II. The notion of expropriation**\n-----------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nIt is not argued in this case that any formal measure of expropriation of Mr. Mitchell's firm had been taken. Claimant contends that the seizure of his firm, including all measures related to such seizure, constitutes an event which has to be qualified as being, directly or indirectly, tantamount to an expropriation, within the meaning of Article III(1) of the BIT, as quoted above.\n\n62.\n\nAs a factual matter, it is not disputed between the Parties that on March 5, 1999, an intervention executed by military forces of the DRC took place, without having been announced. During this intervention, which lasted for several hours, the premises housing the firm of Mr. Mitchell were searched and put under seals, documents qualified as compromising were seized and two lawyers, [\u2026] and [\u2026], put into prison. These individuals remained under arrest for eight months, until the day they were released by a decision of the Military Court on November 12, 1999, which ordered also the removal of the seals placed around the premises of Mr. Mitchell's firm and the return of the documents that had been seized.\n\n63.\n\nWhereas Claimant asserts that the documents taken by the military forces have never been returned, Respondent contends that this had been done. The Military Court refers in its decision to such documents, without further precision. Thus, there is evidence before the Tribunal that part of the firm's documentation and files have been seized on March 5, 1999. Respondent, which has been the holder of these documents during the critical period, has not shown to the Tribunal any proof of their return or restitution, like a copy of a receipt signed by a staff-member of Claimant's firm. Respondent argues that according to Congolese law, it was up to [\u2026] and [\u2026] to collect the documents that were seized and that, if they failed to do so, those documents were deemed to be abandoned; no evidence has been produced in this respect. However, the issue whether the seized documents have been returned or not, is not relevant to the resolution of this dispute. Indeed, Claimant does not seek a relief relating to the return of files or other documents, nor does he claim property he may have lost during the events in 1999. Claimant seeks compensation for damage suffered from the loss of clients and the closing of the firm that occurred on March 5, 1999 and that he continued to suffer after [\u2026] and [\u2026] had been released.\n\n64.\n\nClaimant produced before the Tribunal a number of affidavits made by authorized representatives of companies doing business in the DRC which were clients of Mr. Mitchell's firm at the relevant time, including [\u2026] and its [\u2026] and [\u2026]. It results from these statements, that these clients no longer had recourse to the services of the Claimant's firm as from March 5, 1999, and that they did not return seeking such services when [\u2026] and [\u2026] were released, at a time when Mr. Mitchell's concerns for his own safety did not allow him to re-enter the territory of the DRC. Respondent did not contest nor discuss the fact that Claimant's firm lost clients as a consequence of the intervention of March 5, 1999.\n\n65.\n\nOn the basis of the statements made by representatives of companies which were clients of the firm of Mr. Mitchell, and considering the negative impact that the seizure, operated by military forces for purported reasons related to the security of the DRC, and the subsequent closing of the firm, must have had on the clients of Claimant's firm, the Tribunal concludes that the intervention which took place on March 5, 1999 ended with the total loss of the firm as an entity providing legal services in the DRC.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal has not been given information that the Claimant's firm had reopened anytime after its closing in March 1999. Both Parties mention that Mr. Mitchell went to the Congo, in April 2002 according to the Respondent and in the middle of 2002 according to Claimant. Claimant filed with the Tribunal an \"Amicable Settlement Agreement\" (\"Accord de R\u00e8glement Amiable\") concluded between [\u2026] and [\u2026].\n\n[\u2026]\n\n67.\n\nRespondent's main objection to the claim is that the Mitchell & Associates firm has not been victim of any measure of expropriation and that, therefore, no compensation is due under such title. For the Respondent, indeed, the BIT uses the term expropriation, but it does not contain any definition. Such definition, it says, has therefore to be found by reference to national law, which is in this case the law of the Congo. As stated by Respondent, the law No. 77-001 of February 22, 1977 does provide for expropriation for a public purpose, but it can relate to immovable property only. Even if one would consider that the seizure of movable property would be tantamount to an expropriation, this could be of concern, in the instant case, for the seized documents only. However, these documents have been the subject of a regular seizure which cannot be assimilated to an expropriation. Respondent contends that, as a consequence of the decision of the Military Court, these documents have been returned.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot follow Respondent's arguments in this respect. The State Parties to the BIT have, by necessity, agreed upon an autonomous regime on the protection of investors in case of expropriation, based on international law. If, for each Contracting State, it would be permitted to refer to its own national law to determine the cases qualifying as an expropriation, each State Party to the Treaty would be able to define for its own country the scope of the protection which the Treaty provides to investors. Thus, if one follows Respondent's view, no protection would be warranted in respect of investments in the DRC composed of financial funds, companies, rights to intellectual property, or returns from other investments, all of them being assets different from immovable property and therefore not subject to expropriation under the law of the Congo, notwithstanding the fact that these assets are mentioned on the list of the investments protected under the BIT (Art. I). Such a view in respect of the protection of investments in case of expropriation is manifestly not what the State Parties to the BIT had in mind. Pursuant to Article II(4) BIT, quoted above, the protection of investments shall be in accordance with national laws but it \"may not be less than that recognized by international law\".\n\n69.\n\nMoreover, Respondent's objection does not reflect that the principle of the obligation to offer compensation in case of nationalization or expropriation is contemplated in the Constitution of the DRC of 1994 (Art. 22) and constitutes one of the generally recognized principles of international law, as this has been stated by the Arbitral Tribunal seized through ICSID with the dispute in the matter *Ltd. Benvenuti et Bonfant Srl vs. the Government of the People's Republic of the Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/77/2, Award of August 8, 1980, see International Legal Materials 1982 p. 740, 758, para. 4.64).\n\n70.\n\nAn expropriation of an asset invested is a measure by which the host State, acting for a public purpose, deprives the investor of his title in respect of such asset, totally or in part. Such title can be property or a receivable or any other right which constitutes an asset qualified as an investment by the definition given in Article I of the BIT. As indicated in Article III(1) of the BIT, the notion of an expropriation is not a formal one, which would imply that a decision of an authority of the State would be needed in order to qualify a taking of title as an expropriation. This notion is to be understood as substantial in nature, which means that it covers any measure which is, directly or indirectly, tantamount to an expropriation. The Protocol added to the Treaty further stipulates that \"direct or indirect measures tantamount to expropriation\" may include \"the levying of taxes equivalent to indirect expropriation, the compulsory sale of all or part of an investment, or the impairment or deprivation of the management, control, or economic value of an investment\".\n\n71.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the measures taken by the military authorities of the DRC are tantamount to an expropriation of Mr. Mitchell's investment, including the loss of clients who no longer made use of the services provided by the firm. Done as it was under dramatic circumstances, as is the case in a sudden intervention of military forces, the search and the sealing of the premises of the firm, the detention of two employees for the purported reason of the security of the State, the intervention of March 5, 1999 ended up with the total loss of the firm's clients. That loss is to be explained not only by the fact that the firm ceased to offer services and by the circumstances relating to the intervention on March 5, 1999, but also by the fact that many clients had been asking the firm for counseling in relation to requests to be presented to State authorities, for which Mitchell & Associates was no longer a credible reference after March 5, 1999.\n\n72.\n\nThe arrest of two employees lasted more than eight months and Mr. Mitchell considered preferable to stay abroad waiting for the situation to improve in respect of his safety. The expropriation initiated by the intervention of March 5, 1999 has, therefore, not produced results that could be qualified as being of an exclusively transitory nature. The loss of clients was definitive. It is correct to say that the Military Court ordered the restitution of the documents which had been seized. Such restitution has not been evidenced before this Tribunal. Even if it had occurred, such return would manifestly not have been an incentive for the clients to return. The Tribunal cannot, therefore, share Respondent's view that the removal of the seals, the release of the two employees and the restitution of the items seized for the purpose of the inquiry did re-establish the Claimant in his rights.\n\n73.\n\nUnder the BIT, an expropriation is prohibited if it does not conform with all of the five requirements listed in Article III(1), quoted above. Claimant contends, firstly, that the expropriation he suffered was not made for a public purpose (lit. a) and under due process of law (lit. b) and that it was discriminatory (lit. c). Secondly, he affirms that the measures directed against him were not accompanied by \"prompt, adequate and effectively realizable compensation\" (lit. e).\n\n74.\n\nOn the first point, the Tribunal does not have to rule on it since the sole purpose of the claim is to provide Mr. Mitchell with compensation for the prejudice he suffered. It is true that the decision of the Military Court of November 12, 1999 stated that the arrest of [...] and [...] was not justified and that, with the exception of two cars requisitioned by the army, all items that have been seized had to be returned. Respondent argues, however, that on March 5, 1999, the authorities of the Congo had sufficient reasons to fear for the security of the State and to justify an intervention and an investigation, the principal reason relating to the risk that the product of the sale of the 99 tons of cassiterite would go to [\u2026], a company which was, in the view of the Congolese authorities, run by certain individuals with ties to the rebellion against the Government of the DRC. The Tribunal does not dispose of enough information to evaluate, under all pertinent angles, the situation as it existed in March 1999. It cannot make a statement, therefore, on Respondent's argument that there existed, at the relevant time a public purpose and a legitimate power of the military forces, based on the Constitution or the Law, that would have justified, at least as a preventive measure, the intervention which did actually occur. [\u2026]\n\n**III. The right to receive compensation**\n------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nClaimant affirms, without being contested by Respondent on this point, that he did not receive any compensation in relation to the intervention of March 5, 1999 and its consequences. As the measures taken by the Government of the DRC in respect of the firm of Mr. Mitchell have not been accompanied by a compensation as contemplated in letter e) of Article III(1) BIT, the Government has acted in violation of Article III(1). Such a violation of an undertaking made in the Treaty creates an obligation upon Respondent to repair the economic prejudice thereby suffered by Claimant.\n\n77.\n\nThe compensation to which a victim of an expropriation is entitled is defined in the second part of Article III(1) of the BIT in the following terms:\n\n\"Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment. The calculation of such compensation shall not result in any reduction in such fair market value due to either prior public notice or announcement of the expropriatory action, or the occurrence of the events that constituted or resulted in the expropriatory action. Such compensation shall include interest at a rate equivalent to current international rates from the date of expropriation, and be freely transferable at the prevailing market rate of exchange on the date of expropriation.\"\n\nBy reference to this provision, the Tribunal has to determine the \"fair market value\" of Mr. Mitchell's firm as of March 5, 1999.\n\n78.\n\nFor the purpose of analyzing this value, Claimant has produced an evaluation prepared by [\u2026]. This expert has reviewed Mitchell & Associates' income statements for the fiscal years ending December 31, 1996 through December 31, 1998, the firm's financial statements for the fiscal years ending February 29, 1996 through February 28, 1999, and the firm's accounting records for the years 1996 through 1998. Moreover, [\u2026] indicates that he did interview Mr. Mitchell regarding the background and nature of the firm's practice and that he did research economic and industry data. Professor Maritz has concluded that the \"fair market value\" of the firm at the relevant time was US$ [\u2026]. [\u2026] assumed that the firm not only would have continued to service existing clients but would have acquired new clients, particularly in the mining and banking sectors. Accordingly, he concluded that if the seizure had not occurred, the firm's future profits would have been at least the amount earned in 1998, which is US$ [\u2026] per year. On the basis of this estimated profit, the expert consulted by Claimant used the so-called Capitalized Earnings Approach, under which the expected profits are divided by a risk factor (24 percent in the present instance), which results in a value of the firm to be US$ [\u2026]. He also found that in dividing this value by the expected profits (US$ [\u2026]), such value would have been realized over a period of 4.16 years, which corresponds to the period during which Mr. Mitchell would have continued to practice law in the Congo if the seizure had not occurred. Using also the Discounted Future Earnings Method, [\u2026] arrived at the identical figure of a value of US$ [\u2026].\n\n79.\n\nClaimant has submitted combined income statements for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998, prepared by [\u2026]. They record the income and expenses incurred. For each year, these statements are divided in three parts, reflecting payments made, respectively, through the accounts of Mitchell & Associates in Seattle (Washington, USA) and Johannesburg (South Africa, RSA), as well as the payments provided in cash in local currency in Kinshasa. For reasons related to the monetary fluctuations in the DRC, most clients paid their fees in US$ to the accounts of Mitchell & Associates in the USA or in the RSA, whereas payments in cash were usual in the Congo.\n\n80.\n\nRespondent did not comment in any detail on these statements. The Government of the DRC objects, however, that the statements relating to accounts in the USA and the RSA are in fact connected to activities of the Claimant in those two countries. As they are, in the Respondent's view, unrelated to any service provided in the Congo, they are irrelevant for the evaluation of the Claimant's firm in the DRC. On the basis of the statements of income and the billings filed as evidence of such income, the Tribunal is satisfied that the incomes referred to in these statements are related to services provided by the Claimant's firm in the DRC. The clients to whom these billings were addressed were seeking and have been provided with services of the firm in the Congo. The fact that most payments were addressed to Mr. Mitchell's office in the USA does in no way imply that the office in the DRC did act as a mere sub-contractor. Anyhow, even if this would have been the case, the prejudice caused by the loss of the clients in the Congo would have been the same.\n\n81.\n\nFor the year 1998, which Claimant takes as the main basis for the calculation of his loss, the combined income statement, covering revenue accrued in all three countries (RSA, USA, DRC), shows (in US$):\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThese amounts show a net amount of [\u2026] which reflects in Claimant's view the profit in US$ for 1998.\n\n82.\n\nThe income statements relating to the accounts in the USA and the RSA are supplemented by (1) the journal recording all incomes and expenses, (2) bank statements, (3) a list of payments of client fees and (4) billings to clients.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n87.\n\nIn respect of the accounts held at the Office in Kinshasa, the Tribunal accepts that Claimant's documentation is incomplete as a consequence of the intervention in March 1999. No adverse consequences should be drawn against Claimant for the lack of documents which have been taken away by the military forces and not returned. [\u2026]. The Tribunal finds that the variations and differences appearing when consulting these accounts, as well as the small amounts on balance, do not justify taking them into account for the purpose of establishing the commercial value of the firm, the profit of which results essentially from the accounts held in the USA.\n\n88.\n\nThe analysis of the statements presented and of the information further provided by Claimant lead the Tribunal to the understanding that the effective profit was US$ [\u2026] for 1996, US$ [\u2026] for 1997 and US$ [\u2026] for 1998. [\u2026].\n\n[\u2026]\n\n90.\n\nIn respect of the funds transferred from Claimant's US bank accounts to the DRC office and to the RSA office, Claimant affirms that they represent the expenditure that had already been taken into account in the expenses recorded for the offices in the DRC and in the RSA. Thus, to deduct such inter-office transfers would amount, in Claimant's view, to a double-counting of these expense items. Claimant further contends that the expenses that were funded by the inter-office transfers were brought on the accounts in the DRC and RSA offices and already appear in the combined income statement prepared by [\u2026]. The Tribunal, however, observes that the payments debited on the accounts of the US office for the purpose of funding the DRC and the RSA offices were reasonably to be credited on the accounts of the latter offices, before the expenses of these offices were actually paid with the respective amounts. Claimant has not provided the Tribunal with any further detail about these transfers. The accounts of the RSA office contain several deposits originating from the US office. Therefore, when these payments are deducted from the amount on credit of the US account and subsequently credited to the DRC/RSA accounts, no double-counting occurs. Therefore, these amounts cannot be added to the figure representing the profits made through the US office.\n\n91.\n\nClaimant contends that in order to assess the level of profitability which would have occurred in the future, the appropriate figure is determinable by averaging the three years 1996 to 1998 either by simple average or weighted average. In the Tribunal's view, such an approach is reasonable in light of the important variations in the annual results. The variations in the annual results are considerable. The decrease in profit in 1998 has not been explained as being exceptional, apart from the fact that the bonus paid to [\u2026] was particularly high that year. It has been noted also that certain expenses are included in the loss registered in the RSA. In addition, some weight has to be given to the lack of more structured and readable accounts, despite the repeated queries addressed to Claimant. The Tribunal therefore concludes that an amount of US$ [\u2026] could reasonably be retained as an expected annual benefit as from 1999.\n\n92.\n\nThe evaluation of the period subsequent to the events of March 1999 during which profit is to be anticipated is a delicate matter. The Tribunal observes that [\u2026] did not explain the manner in which he applied (1) the Capitalized Earnings Approach and (2) the Discounted Earnings Method, nor did he demonstrate how these methods take into account the particular circumstances related to Mitchell & Associates activity. After a first query addressed to Claimant in its letter of March 10, 2003, the Tribunal wrote again to the Claimant through its letter of August 14, 2003, in the following terms:\n\n\"..., Claimant has given a short reply only to the question raised by the Tribunal in its March 10, 2003 letter concerning [\u2026] evaluation (questions No. 2 and 3), basically repeating what has already been written in the first Memorial on the merits. Claimant is invited again to reply fully to the questions raised, in order to allow the Tribunal to understand (1) the methods of calculation that have been applied and (2) the determination of the factor for capitalization which would support the conclusion that the benefit of the Firm was to be expected for a period of 4.16 years as from March 1999 in the particular market of provision of legal services in the DRC.\"\n\nIn its answer of September 5, 2003, Claimant explained that the income used was the last two years annualised results. The amount of US$ [\u2026] was used as an extremely conservative estimate of the future earnings, assuming no growth in earnings and already taking account of the developments within the DRC. Claimant added that the capitalization rate of 24% was based on the average rate used in all transactions valued by [\u2026] since 1992 and involving similar firms of attorneys. In this respect, says Claimant, both the DRC and South Africa are to be classified as relatively similar in country status, which allows the use of the same rate. However, these statements have not been supported by appropriate evidence, the Claimant's adding only that he offers to brief a further expert if the Tribunal finds that the explanation by [\u2026] is inadequate. Claimant did not explain to the Tribunal to what extent the economic and industry data collected by [\u2026], which have not been presented to the Tribunal, support the estimated profit anticipated for more than 4 years as from March 1999.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that the mining and banking sector in which the Claimant was particularly involved, are among the most profitable parts of the Congo's economy, despite a lack of political stability in that country. However, the commercial value that Claimant identifies essentially as his know-how and client-basis can hardly be given an asset-value of more than four years. First of all, the capitalization rate of 24% used by [\u2026] might be valid in the South African context; however, one cannot assimilate the economic and political environment of the Congo to that of South Africa. A higher capitalization rate would clearly be required in the case of the Congo. Secondly, it has been established that Mr. Mitchell visited the Congo some time in 2002, without being interfered with. In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that a shorter period would be more realistic, which it establishes at three years. It results from this that the \"fair market value\" of Mitchell & Associates was at the relevant time US$ 750,000.\n\n94.\n\nClaimant submits that the rate of interest applicable to this amount is the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Bank prime loan rate which was at 7.75 percent in March 1999. Respondent argues that this matter is governed by the law of the DRC, which provides for a rate not higher than 6% in respect of civil law claims and 8% in commercial matters, to be determined as from the date of the filing of the claim with the court. In reply, Claimant, without arguing about the applicable law, contends that Congolese law gives power to the courts to determine the rate of interest in a range between 6% and 12% and that in tort actions, the injured party may recover interest on the damages from the date of the loss. Respondent rejects this explanation, adding in particular that under Congolese law, a tort claim cannot produce interest before it comes into legal existence by a court order awarding the principal amount. The Tribunal, however, has to apply the pertinent provisions of the BIT which prevail over Congolese domestic law. Pursuant to the second paragraph of Article III(1) of the BIT (corresponding to the third paragraph of the same provision in the French version), \"compensation shall include interest at a rate equivalent to current international rates\", to be fixed as \"from the date of expropriation\". The Tribunal is of the view that the rate indicated by Claimant is appropriate. Therefore, the annual rate of 7.75% shall apply to the amount of US$ 750,000 as from March 6, 1999.\n\n95.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal decides that Respondent has to pay to Claimant the amount of US$ 750,000 plus interest thereon at a rate of 7.75% per annum from March 6, 1999 until the date of payment.\n\n**D. The Counter-claim of the DRC**\n-----------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nIn its counter-memorial of September 3, 2001, Respondent presented a counterclaim on damages for the amount of one million US dollars \"for nuisances caused by the petitioner\" and \"for attack to the good reputation to the DRC\". In its counter-memorial in reply of January 7, 2003, Respondent indicated an amount of US$ [...], covering both the damages for attacking the reputation of the DRC and for the costs incurred by the latter for its defense in this litigation. In the answer given to the questions raised by the Tribunal in its letter of March 10, 2003, Respondent explained the difference between these two amounts by the costs related to its defense in this proceeding.\n\n97.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal's conclusion that Claimant has been the victim of an expropriation in violation of Article III(1) of the BIT and that Respondent shall be required to pay Claimant an appropriate compensation, the Tribunal concludes that the counter-claim is not founded in the light of the outcome of this dispute. The allocation of costs will be dealt with below.\n\n**E. The division of the costs of these proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nClaimant requests that Respondent be required to reimburse to him all his costs incurred in undertaking this arbitration, including the arbitrators' fees, the fees of any expert, the legal costs incurred by Mr. Mitchell and any administrative costs. Claimant's costs have been identified as US$ 206,560 (divided in US$ 172,337.40 and R 243,223.81) *.*\n\n99.\n\nRespondent requests that Claimant be required to pay the DRC all costs incurred as expenses in the present litigation, including fees of arbitrators and experts. Respondent's costs have been identified as US$ 307,907.50.\n\n100.\n\nTaking into account that Respondent did oppose without success the Tribunal's jurisdiction and that its objections to the merits of the claim have been rejected by the Tribunal, as well as its counter-claim, while Claimant has been successful with respect to a part of his claim only, the Tribunal finds appropriate that Respondent shall bear its own costs, expenses and counsel fees and that it shall contribute to Claimant's costs by the amount of US$ 35,000. Claimant shall bear its own costs, expenses and counsel fees above this amount of US$ 35,000. The costs incurred by the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID have been settled by Claimant in the amount of US$ 110,000 and by Respondent in the amount of US$ 70,000. The Tribunal decides that Respondent shall bear its share and shall further pay to Claimant the amount of US$ 60,000, who will bear the costs of the Tribunal he paid above the latter amount. Therefore, Respondent shall pay to Claimant the total amount of US$ 95,000, together with interest at an annual rate of 7.75% as from the date of the Award.\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects moreover Claimant's request to be awarded an amount of US$ 530,000 in case Respondent would not pay the amount awarded within the time limit provided for by the Tribunal. Indeed, apart from the fact that the Tribunal's decision cannot include an indemnity for an hypothetical prejudice, Arbitration Rule 28 does not allow the allocation of costs incurred by a party after the closure of the proceeding.\n\n**F. Decision**\n---------------\n\n102.\n\nOn the basis of the reasons given above, the Tribunal, by a majority, finds as follows:\n\n1. This dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of this Tribunal.\n\n2. Mr. Patrick H. Mitchell has been the victim of an expropriation by the Democratic Republic of the Congo in violation of Article III(1) of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States of America.\n\n3. The Democratic Republic of the Congo shall pay to Mr. Patrick H. Mitchell the amount of US$ 750,000.00 plus an interest on such amount at an annual rate of 7.75%, commencing on March 6, 1999, until the date of payment.\n\n4. The counter-claim of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is rejected.\n\n5. The Democratic Republic of the Congo shall bear its own costs, expenses, counsel fees, including its share of the costs incurred by the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo shall pay to Mr. Patrick H. Mitchell the total amount of US$ 95,000, together with interest at an annual rate of 7.75% as from the date of the Award, as a contribution to Claimant's costs, expenses and counsel fees, including his share of the costs incurred by the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID.\n\nMr. Patrick H. Mitchell shall bear his costs, expenses and counsel fees, including his share of the costs incurred by the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID, in any amount higher than US$ 95,000."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2004-11-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 7 June 2004 the Democratic Republic of the Congo (\"DRC\" or \"Respondent\" or \"Applicant\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") an application (\"the Application\") requesting the annulment of an Award rendered on February 9, 2004 in ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7 (\"the Award\") between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mr. Patrick Mitchell (\"Claimant\"). The Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on July 15, 2004 and transmitted a Notice of Registration to the Parties on that date.\n\n2.\n\nThe Application for the annulment of the Award comprised a request for the stay of its enforcement under Article 52(5) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\") and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"). Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, second sentence, provides: *\"If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\"* Accordingly, the Secretary-General, together with the Notice of Registration, informed the Parties that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n3.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee was constituted on August 24, 2004. Rule 54(2), second sentence, of the Arbitration Rules provides: *\"As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\"* In the present case, the Democratic Republic of the Congo submitted such a request by letter of August 30, 2004. Therefore the Committee had until September 30, 2004 to rule on whether or not to continue the stay of enforcement.\n\n4.\n\nIn order to give the Parties the opportunity to fully present their observations on the issue of the continuation of the stay of enforcement, and for the Committee to rule on this issue in both languages (English and French), the Parties were asked by letter of September 9, 2004 to agree on the extension of the time limit set forth in Rule 54(2), second sentence, of the Arbitration Rules, until November 30, 2004. Both the Democratic Republic of the Congo by letter of September 17, 2004 and Mr. Patrick Mitchell by e-mail of September 19, 2004 agreed to this extension.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of September 21, 2004, the Parties were invited to submit their observations on the issue of stay of enforcement: the DRC had to submit its observations by October 5, 2004 and Mr. Patrick Mitchell to submit his response by October 20, 2004.\n\n6.\n\nThe Parties complied with the prescribed time limits and consequently the Centre received on October 5, 2004 the observations of the DRC on the issue of stay of enforcement and on October 20, 2004 Mr. Patrick Mitchell\u2019s response.\n\n7.\n\nIn compliance with Rule 13 of the Arbitration Rules the Committee held its first session on October 23, 2004 in Paris. The Parties participated in this session by telephone conference. On that occasion new time limits for the submission of additional observations were agreed: the DRC had to submit its reply by October 28, 2004 and Mr. Patrick Mitchell had to submit his rejoinder by November 3, 2004.\n\n8.\n\nThe Parties complied with the prescribed time limits and consequently the Centre received on October 28, 2004 the reply of the DRC and on November 3, 2004 Mr. Patrick Mitchell\u2019s rejoinder.\n\n9.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mr. Patrick Mitchell indicated through their e-mails of November 5, 2004 and November 8, 2004, respectively, their agreement not to hold an oral hearing on the issue of stay of enforcement. The Committee was also of the opinion that there was no use of holding such a hearing.\n\n**II. PARTIES\u2019 POSITION**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. The position of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as presented through its written submissions of October 5 and October 28, 2004, is in summary the following:**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nFirst, the DRC contends that it would be very difficult for it, if not impossible, to recoup the amount of the Award in case the latter is annulled. It explains that Mr. Patrick Mitchell, as an attorney, has professional activities that are founded on intangible goods as his know-how and clientele, in respect of which no forcible execution is possible. The DRC adds that Mr. Patrick Mitchell\u2019s income is dispersed among several countries, and indicates on this point that the amount awarded to him by the Award may be claimed by his partners or by his law firms, which would make it more difficult for the DRC to recoup the amount. Respondent also contends that Mr. Patrick Mitchell has at his disposal the necessary means to possibly proceed to financial operations determining the localization of his income, and that moreover he has no known residence. The DRC concludes that a forcible execution against Mr. Patrick Mitchell would be almost impossible.\n\n11.\n\nSecond, the DRC contends that Mr. Patrick Mitchell has lucrative professional activities, so that there would be no urgency for him to recoup the amount of the Award, all the more so as this amount bears interest until the date of actual payment. Further on this point, Respondent argues that Mr. Patrick Mitchell\u2019s acceptance of the extension of the time limit in order to let the Committee rule on the stay proves that there is no urgency for him.\n\n12.\n\nThird, the DRC contends that the grounds for annulment invoked by it are *prima facie* relevant, pointing out in this regard that these grounds concur with the criticism expressed by the dissenting arbitrator Mr. Yawovi Agboyibo, who was appointed by the Centre. In other words, the DRC contends that the annulment proceedings are not dilatory, as the grounds for annulment it invokes are serious.\n\n13.\n\nThe DRC concludes that the requested stay of enforcement should be granted without any guarantee in favour of Mr. Patrick Mitchell. It explains that, generally speaking, the posting of a guarantee, which is an important burden for a developing country as the DRC, would have a \"deterrent effect\" on the submission of applications for annulment that are made in good faith and are well-founded. The DRC adds that if, as Claimant contends, its financial situation is difficult, it is not obvious at all that it would be able to negotiate a guarantee under reasonable conditions; furthermore, the posting of such a guarantee would constitute a precedent for its other creditors.\n\n14.\n\nIn respect of the placement in an escrow account of the amount of the Award, as proposed by Mr. Patrick Mitchell, the DRC explains that it has other budgetary priorities. Referring to the Resolution 1565 of October 1, 2004 of the UN Security Council, the DRC specifies that its funds should be used, as a matter of priority, for maintaining international peace and security. In this context, the DRC contends that the amount due to Mr. Patrick Mitchell acquires considerable importance since, leaving aside the interest accruing, it would allow to pay the salary of 2,071 Congolese soldiers during six months or of 12,426 soldiers during one month; together with interest, this amount would allow to pay the salary of 2,878 soldiers during six months or of 17,270 soldiers during one month.\n\n15.\n\nThe DRC finally indicates that the international organizations were called upon by the Security Council, in the above-mentioned Resolution, to provide their support to the DRC in its endeavours to restoring its territorial integrity and developing its economy. Therefore, the DRC considers that the Committee should grant the stay of enforcement without any condition.\n\n**B. Mr. Patrick Mitchell's position, as presented through his written submissions of October 20 and November 3, 2004, is in summary the following:**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nMr. Patrick Mitchell asserts that the DRC had, as of February 9, 2004, an obligation to pay him the amount of the Award in accordance with the provisions of the Bilateral Treaty between the United States of America and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the ICSID Convention. In this regard, Claimant contends that the application for annulment and the request for stay of enforcement filed by the DRC are specious and only aim at further delaying its payment.\n\n17.\n\nClaimant responds to the first argument of the DRC, regarding the difficulty in recouping the amount, by indicating his addresses in South Africa and the United States. Claimant also proposes to provide Respondent with a list of assets that could be attached should the DRC be successful in the annulment proceedings, on condition that Respondent proceeds alike.\n\n18.\n\nMr. Patrick Mitchell further contends that he accepted the stay of enforcement of the Award until the end of November 2004 only because of his concern for fairness, so that each party could present its observations.\n\n19.\n\nClaimant adds that he cannot find, neither in the Award nor in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Yawovi Agboyibo, any *prima facie* evidence that would justify the annulment of the Award; on the contrary, he is convinced that all of Respondent's actions have a dilatory motive.\n\n20.\n\nIn regard to the issue of posting a guarantee in case the stay of enforcement is granted, Mr. Patrick Mitchell indicates in his first written submission that he would be happy, in order to avoid the DRC bearing the related bank fees, to place into escrow an amount equal to the said bank fees which would be payable to Respondent in the event the latter is successful in having the Award annulled. Mr. Patrick Mitchell indicates further that, in case the DRC is ordered to provide a guarantee for the amount of the Award, plus costs and interest to date, he would be willing to waive any further interest that may accrue during the period of annulment procedure1.\n\nThe Committee, perceiving this position of Mr. Patrick Mitchell as an implicit offer of amicable settlement with the DRC on the stay, drew the attention of the DRC on this point during the session of October 23, 2004, asking it to take position. The DRC continued pleading against the guarantee.\n\n21.\n\nAs Respondent continued pleading against the guarantee in its reply of October 28, 2004, Mr. Patrick Mitchell concluded in his response of November 3, 2004 that deciding the stay of enforcement of the Award on condition that a guarantee be provided would be in conformity with the practice of ICSID annulment proceedings. In support of this position, he refers to different precedents and to an ICSID document (\"Discussion Paper\") of October 22, 2004. Further, Mr. Patrick Mitchell underlines that nothing in the ICSID Convention says that a party to an ICSID arbitration is entitled to protection against enforcement efforts while pursuing an annulment of the award. Mr. Patrick Mitchell draws thus the conclusion that Respondent should bear a real cost as a counterbalance to a Committee\u2019s decision to grant the stay of enforcement.\n\n22.\n\nMr. Patrick Mitchell\u2019s concluding statements of his written submission of October 20, 2004 remain unchanged: Mr. Patrick Mitchell agrees to a stay of enforcement until the annulment proceedings are terminated, on the condition that Respondent provide a guarantee or place the amount of the Award to date into escrow; otherwise, Mr. Patrick Mitchell requests the termination of the current stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n**III. DISCUSSION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The issue of stay of enforcement**\n---------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nAccording to Article 52(5) of the Convention: *\"The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision.\"* No indication is given as to what kind of circumstances require a stay; therefore the Committee is free to evaluate the arguments of the Parties in view of the particularities of each case. In this respect, the ICSID precedents do not bind the Committee. However, these precedents constitute examples of the practice, which must thus be taken into consideration, especially when the Parties refer to them, as in the present case; and these precedents may influence the Committee if they are convincing and if they concern similar circumstances.\n\n24.\n\nThe first argument of the DRC relates to the difficulties in recouping the amount of the Award, in case the latter is annulled. In this respect, the Committee retains that Mr. Patrick Mitchell is a natural person, whose activities and assets are difficult to localize. Thus, theoretically, possible difficulties in recoupment cannot be excluded. In reply to this argument, Mr. Patrick Mitchell declared that he was ready to provide a list of assets that could be attached. This proposal shows good will; yet, it does not suffice for excluding a possible danger of nonrecoupment. Lastly, the circumstances of the present case resemble those of the *MINE*2 case, the reasoning of which was adopted also in the *Wena*3 case. The concern of the Democratic Republic of the Congo about not being able to recoup the paid amounts is thus justifiable.\n\nMaritime International Nominees Establishment [MINE] v. Republic of Guinea, Decision partially annulling the award, Dec. 22, 1989, 5 ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ. 95 (1990): *\"MINE is a corporation controlled by a single individual who would be able to thwart any recoupment by Guinea of assets seized by MINE by transferring those assets out of MINE.\"*\n\nWena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt, Decision on application for annulment, Feb. 5, 2002, 41 I.L.M. 933, paras. 5-6 (2002); Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt, Procedural Order No. 1 of the *ad hoc* Committee concerning the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the award, Apr. 5, 2001, 18(10) Mealey's Int'l Arb. Rep. 33 (2003): \"... *Wena Hotels Limited is currently reduced to a \u2018shell' company, almost entirely without assets, and that is controlled by a single individual.\"*\n\n25.\n\nAs to the second argument of the DRC, regarding the absence of urgency for Mr. Patrick Mitchell to have the amount of the Award at his disposal, this is not capable of influencing the Committee's reasoning. Mr. Patrick Mitchell is the beneficiary of the Award of February 9, 2004, and therefore he has the right to seek enforcement of this Award. Whether or not he actually needs to have the amount of the Award at his disposal immediately, is a contingent question, personal to Mr. Patrick Mitchell and outside the context of the present proceedings.\n\n26.\n\nThe Committee refuses to enter into the question of the *prima facie* relevance of the grounds for annulment, which is another argument of the DRC. As a matter of fact, any discussion on the merits and on the chances of annulment of the Award would be misplaced. Having said that, the *prima facie* dilatory character of the application for annulment is a distinct question that does not refer to the chances of success of the application but to the manner in which the latter is presented, *i.e.* to the apparent seriousness of the invoked grounds; a *prima facie* dilatory application would be the one with a manifestly abusive character and would for that reason only exclude the stay of enforcement. The application filed by the DRC has not such a character; and this is so, irrespective of the close similarities between some of its arguments and the position of the dissenting arbitrator Mr. Yawovi Agboyibo. Besides, the fact that the application for annulment was filed by the DRC at the end of the time limit prescribed in Article 52(2) of the Convention, which was underlined by Mr. Patrick Mitchell, does not change at all the above consideration: the time limits for the exercise of a right allow the interested party to take advantage of them until the last moment, all the more so if said party is a State that needs to set in motion several wheels of its administration.\n\n27.\n\nThe current situation of the DRC constitutes an argument that has been invoked by Respondent in connection with the question of the escrow account. Still, the Committee is of the opinion that it has to firstly examine this argument in connection with its decision on the stay. Given the sensitive political situation of the DRC, described in the UN Resolution 1565 of October 1, 2004 to which Respondent refers, significant efforts have to be made in order to ensure peace and security in the region, which entails an important financial burden for the State. The Committee is of the opinion that, in this context, the payment, leaving aside the interest accruing, of the amount of 750,000 plus 95,000 USD ordered by the Award \u2014 even if this amount seems minimal \u2014 could constitute today a significant additional burden for the DRC. Even if there is no question \u2014 as was the case in MINE \u2014 of *\"catastrophic, immediate and irreversible consequences for its ability to conduct its affairs\"*4, still the immediate payment by the DRC of this amount may obstruct its plans for the restoration of its authority and for the economic and social development of the country.\n\nOp. c. note 2: *\"The criterion is, rather, whether termination of the stay would have what Guinea calls 'catastrophic' immediate and irreversible consequences for its ability to conduct its affairs.\"*\n\n28.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee considers that if the amount of the Award is paid, on the one hand, real difficulties in recouping the amount should the Award be annulled cannot be excluded and, on the other hand, there is an obvious risk that such payment would have unfortunate repercussions on the DRC\u2019s efforts to achieve its restructuring. None of the above considerations may in itself justify the stay of enforcement; yet, due to their coexistence the Committee is inclined to accept the stay of enforcement, all the more so as this seems to be in conformity with the general practice. Indeed, in a different field but with the same \u2018raison d\u2019\u00eatre\u2019, stay of enforcement pending an appeal from a judicial decision is, according to several national laws, almost automatic5. Same stands in the context of applications for setting aside arbitral awards under Article VI of the New York Convention. Finally and most importantly, though the annulment of an ICSID award constitutes an exceptional remedy, the stay of enforcement of the award, pending an annulment procedure, was granted in all cases where such stay was requested6.\n\nSee in the same effect Paul D. Friedland \"Stay of Enforcement of the Arbitral Award Pending ICSID Annulment Proceedings,\" in Annulment of ICSID Awards, IAI Series on International Arbitration No. 1\n\nAmco Asia Corporation and Others v. Republic of Indonesia, Decision annulling the Award, May 16, 1986, 25 I.L.M. 1439 (1986) [Amco I]; Amco Asia Corporation and Others v. Republic of Indonesia, Decision rejecting the parties\u2019 applications for annulment of the Award and annulling the decision on supplement decisions and rectifications, Dec. 17, 1992 [Amco II] (quoted in the article of Paul D. Friedland, op. c. note 5); Wena, op. c. note 3; MINE, op. c. note 2; CDC Group PLC v. Republic of Seychelles, Decision on Whether or Not to Continue Stay and Order of July 14, 2004, published on the site www. transnational-disputes-management.com.\n\n29.\n\nThus, the Committee decides unanimously that the stay of enforcement of the Award of February 9, 2004 shall continue until its decision on the application for annulment filed by the DRC is issued.\n\n**B. The issue of the guarantee**\n---------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe stay of enforcement of the Award may be combined or not with a guarantee in favour of Mr. Patrick Mitchell, the beneficiary of the Award. In examining this issue, the Committee starts with some general considerations:\n\n31.\n\nThe posting of a guarantee aims at preventing the risk of non-enforcement in the future. It is no exaggeration to say that the guarantee is a form of \"conditional payment in advance\"7. Nowhere in the Convention or in the ICSID Rules is it said that the stay of enforcement should or might (as is the case of Article VI of the New York Convention) be combined with the posting of a guarantee. It is obvious, however, that this question is let to the discretion of the Committee. On this point, it is noted that all the ICSID *ad hoc* Committees which had to decide on the stay of enforcement of an award8 had also dealt with the issue of guarantee. Four of them conditioned their decision to grant the stay upon the posting of a guarantee9. Only one of them granted the stay without any guarantee10. The ICSID Discussion Paper of October 22, 2004 just acknowledges this practice.\n\n*See* Paul D. Friedland, op. c. note 5.\n\nAmco I, op. c. note 6; Amco II, op. c. note 6; Wena, op. c. note 3; MINE, op. c. note 2; CDC Group PLC, op. c. note 6.\n\nAmco I, op. c. note 6; Amco II, op. c. note 6; Wena, op. c. note 3; CDC Group PLC, op. c. note 6.\n\nMINE, op. c. note 2.\n\n32.\n\nThe strongest argument against the granting of a guarantee, to which the DRC expressly refers, is that its beneficiary would be in a much more favourable position regarding the enforcement of the award than he was before the provisional stay. This was also the main consideration which led the Committee in the *MINE* case to grant the stay of enforcement without the condition of a guarantee11. The above argument is strengthened by the fact that such an improvement in the position of the beneficiary of the award is juxtaposed with Article 55 of the Convention, which preserves the immunity of the signatory States from execution.\n\nOp. c. note 2 : *\"To require such a guarantee would, in addition to involving what might turn out to be very heavy expenditure for the fees of the guaranteeing bank and possibly making it necessary to freeze the amount of the Award and the interest accruing thereon, place MINE in a much more favourable position than it enjoys at the present time and also in a more favourable position than it enjoyed prior to the provisional stay.\"*\n\n33.\n\nHowever, by virtue of the Convention a State has the obligation to comply with the award, while annulment of an ICSID award is \"unusual\"12. It thus seems reasonable to order the posting of a guarantee when a State requests the stay of enforcement of the award, except if this entails significant costs for said State, or the freezing of the amount due with serious consequences on this State's budget. Moreover, if the posting of a guarantee does actually improve the position of the beneficiary of the award with respect to enforcement, it also constitutes the counterbalance to the negative effect of the stay on the beneficiary, *i.e.* the counterbalance to the delay in his satisfaction through payment of the amount of the award, which in principle should be immediate.\n\n*\"an unusual remedy for unusual situations\": See* C. Schreuer, \"Three Generations of ICSID Annulment Proceedings,\" in Annulment of ICSID Awards, IAI Series on International Arbitration No. 1, especially p. 42.\n\n34.\n\nYet, on the other hand, it should be kept in mind that the guarantee aims at ensuring the payment\u2014in case the award is upheld\u2014and that consequently there must exist a serious risk of non-enforcement of the award in the future.\n\n35.\n\nIn the present case:\n\n36.\n\nFirst, the possibility of an escrow account is to be excluded (alternative request of Mr. Patrick Mitchell for a security conditioning the decision on the stay). Indeed, as it has already been decided by the *ad hoc* Committee in the context of the issue of the stay of enforcement *per se*, the fact that the DRC cannot use the amount of the Award because of an immediate payment might have significant repercussions on its present situation. It is obvious that the placement of this amount in an escrow account, *i.e.* its freezing until the decision on the annulment of the Award is issued, would have the same result for the DRC.\n\n37.\n\nAll the arguments of the DRC regarding its difficult position relate to the freezing of the amount as a consequence of an escrow account, and not to the posting of a bank guarantee. In regard to the latter, the DRC's arguments aim only at refuting Claimant's arguments; they are limited to the difficulty in negotiating a guarantee under *\"reasonable conditions\"* and to the risk that a guarantee *\"would induce other creditors to request similar treatment.\"* In the Committee's opinion, the first argument is not relevant as presented\u2014 *i.e.* in a hypothetical and imprecise way\u2014and does not allow any further discussion, all the more so because it is difficult to believe that a State would not be in a position to furnish a bank guarantee for about one million dollars under, more or less, acceptable conditions. As to the second argument, it can in no way influence the Committee in its decision; it might only lead the Committee to think that there are indeed several creditors of the DRC who remain unpaid.\n\n38.\n\nAs to Mr. Patrick Mitchell\u2019s arguments in favour of a guarantee, these refer to the existence of a very important debt of the DRC towards local creditors, which does not imply however that the DRC would not respect its international obligations.\n\n39.\n\nGiven the Parties\u2019 arguments, the Committee feels obliged to take some distance and revert to some more general and objective considerations in order to make its decision:\n\n40.\n\nReference is made to the most important argument against the posting of a guarantee mentioned herein above under para. 32, namely the improvement of the position of the beneficiary of the guarantee with respect to enforcement. There is no doubt about this improvement, but there is more: indeed, from another perspective, as regards the debtor and his right to request the annulment of the award according to Article 52 of the Convention and Rule 50 of the Arbitration Rules, it can be said that the posting of a guarantee, which is always a burden, penalizes in fact the party that applies for annulment. However, a party must remain free to file such an application for annulment. Moreover, there is no doubt that in the absence of the annulment procedure, the States would not have ratified the ICSID Convention13. And, on this point, the Committee is of the opinion that the DRC\u2019s argument about the \"deterrent effect\" of the posting of a guarantee on the submission by developing countries of applications for annulment made in good faith, has a certain value.\n\n*See* Pierre Lalive, \"Concluding Remarks,\" in Annulment of ICSID Awards, IAI Series on International Arbitration No. 1, especially p. 300.\n\n41.\n\nFurther, the posting of a guarantee is not absolutely necessary to ensure the future enforcement of the award in case the latter is upheld. The immunity of a State from execution (Article 55 of the Convention) does not exempt it from enforcing the award, given its formal commitment in this respect following signature of the Convention. If it does not enforce the award, its behaviour is subject to various indirect sanctions. Precisely, reference is made to Articles 27 and 64 of the Convention. The investor\u2019s State has the right, according to Article 27, to exercise diplomatic protection against the State which does not respect its obligation to enforce an arbitral award of the Centre; but also, according to Article 64, to have recourse to the International Court of Justice14. Moreover, a State's refusal to enforce an ICSID award may have a negative effect on this State's position in the international community with respect to the continuation of international financing or the inflow of other investments.\n\n*See* Christoph H. Schreuer, \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,\" Article 64, pages 1259 et seq., especially p. 1263.\n\n42.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the *ad hoc* Committee by majority, notwithstanding the fact that the DRC did not prove that the posting of a guarantee would entail significant costs having serious consequences on its present situation, is however of the opinion that an order for the stay of enforcement is not necessarily conditioned upon the posting of a guarantee except if the Committee is convinced that circumstances, which would make more difficult the enforcement of the award should the latter be upheld, do actually exist. In the present case the Committee is not convinced that the DRC, albeit its present political difficulties, will not comply in the future with its international obligations deriving from the ICSID Convention. In addition, the amount of the Award being minimal indeed, it is difficult to believe that the DRC would expose itself to the risk of the abovementioned sanctions (para. 41) by denying enforcement of the Award in the event the latter is upheld.\n\n43.\n\nOne of the three members of the Committee, while completely agreeing with the reasoning of the present chapter on the guarantee, however concludes differently, giving more weight to the considerations under the above paragraphs 33, 37 and 38 and considering especially the following elements: (i) the DRC does not prove\u2014not even argues\u2014that the posting of a guarantee would be a really important burden for it (because the bank fees would be very significant or the amount of the Award should be frozen); (ii) objectively, the bank fees concerning the posting of a guarantee with respect to this minimal amount cannot be very high; (iii) in the specific context of an annulment procedure of the ICSID, it is not reasonable to decide on the guarantee by reason solely of the principle *per se* that a State is obligated to comply with its international obligations (a Committee could never thus have conviction that a State would not comply with such an obligation in the future and consequently the posting of a guarantee should never be ordered against a State). According to the minority opinion, the posting of a bank guarantee by the DRC for the entire amount of the Award would be justified in view of the circumstances of the present case.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\nTherefore, the *ad hoc* Committee decides that:\n\nEnforcement of the Award rendered on February 9, 2004 shall continue to be stayed according to Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules, until the *ad hoc* Committee issues its decision on the application for annulment filed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe present Decision is signed on behalf of the Committee by its President."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Award", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2006-11-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Award\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Object of the Dispute and the Award under Consideration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nIn accordance with the Award of February 9, 2004 (\"Award\") para. 23, the dispute between Mr. Patrick Mitchell (\"Claimant\") of the law firm \"Mitchell & Associates\" and the Democratic Republic of Congo (\"DRC\" or \"Respondent\")\n\n\"relates to the intervention ordered by the Military Court of the Democratic Republic of Congo and executed on March 5, 1999 when the premises housing Mr. Mitchell's firm were put under seals, documents qualified as compromising and other items were seized, the employees of the firm were forced to leave the premises and two lawyers, Mr. Risasi and Mr. Djunga, were put into prison. These individuals remained incarcerated until the day of their release by a decision of the Military Court on November 12, 1999, which also ordered the removal of the seals placed on the premises of Mr. Mitchell's firm.\"\n\n2.\n\nAccording to the Request for Arbitration, the jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"Centre\") is based on the Bilateral Treaty concluded in 1984 between the United States of America and the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly the Republic of Za\u00efre) Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment (\"Treaty\" or \"BIT\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal, having joined the examination of the objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent to the examination of the merits, rendered its Award of February 9, 2004 (\"Award\") in resolution of the whole of the dispute. The operative part of the Award states as follows:\n\n\"1. This dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of this Tribunal.\n\n2. Mr. Patrick H. Mitchell has been the victim of an expropriation by the Democratic Republic of the Congo in violation of Article III(1) of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States of America.\n\n3. The Democratic Republic of the Congo shall pay to Mr. Patrick H. Mitchell the amount of US$750,000 plus an interest on such amount at an annual rate of 7.75%, commencing on March 6, 1999, until the date of payment.\n\n4. The counter-claim of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is rejected.\n\n5. The Democratic Republic of the Congo shall bear its own costs, expenses, counsel fees, including its share of the costs incurred by the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo shall pay to Mr. Patrick H. Mitchell the total amount of US$95,000, together with interest at an annual rate of 7.75% as from the date of the Award, as a contribution to Claimant's costs, expenses and counsel fees, including his share of the costs incurred by the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID.\n\nMr. Patrick H. Mitchell shall bear his costs, expenses and counsel fees, including his share of the costs incurred by the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID, in any amount higher than US$95,000.\"\n\n**B. The Course of the Annulment Proceedings**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 7 June 2004, the Centre received an Application for Annulment (\"Application\") dated the same day from the Democratic Republic of Congo, regarding the arbitral Award rendered on February 9, 2004. The Application for Annulment was based on two of the grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"Washington Convention\" or \"Convention\"), namely manifest excess of powers and failure to state the reasons. The application was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on July 15, 2004.\n\n5.\n\nThe Application for annulment of the Award also included a request for the stay of enforcement of the Award on the basis of Article 52(5) of the Convention and Rule 54(1) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"). In accordance with the second sentence of Article 52(5) of the Convention, the Secretary-General notified the parties, when transmitting to them the notice of registration by the Centre of the Application, that enforcement of the Award had been stayed provisionally.\n\n6.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee was constituted on August 24, 2004, following appointment of its members by the Chairman in accordance with Article 52(3) of the Convention. An extension of the time period referred to in Rule 54(2), second sentence, of the Arbitration Rules having been agreed upon by the parties, they were invited to present their observations on the question of the stay of enforcement of the Award. The Centre received the observations of the DRC on October 5, 2004, and the reply of Mr. Patrick Mitchell on October 20, 2004.\n\n7.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 13 of the Arbitration Rules, a first session was held on October 23, 2004 in Paris, in which the parties participated by telephone conference. Minutes of this first session were prepared in French and in English, the two languages of the proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nAt the first session, agreement was reached on the dates for a new exchange of written pleadings between the parties on the question of the stay of enforcement of the Award. Consequently, on October 28, 2004 the Centre received the reply from the DRC and on November 3, 2004 the rejoinder from Mr. Patrick Mitchell. The parties stated that they agreed not to hold a hearing on the issue of the stay of enforcement, and the *ad hoc* Committee was also of the opinion that holding such a hearing was not of real use.\n\n9.\n\nThe decision on the stay of enforcement of the Award was rendered in French and English on November 30, 2004. The *ad hoc* Committee decided that:\n\n\"Enforcement of the Award rendered on February 9, 2004 shall continue to be stayed according to Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules, until the *ad hoc* Committee issues its decision on the application for annulment filed by the Democratic Republic of Congo.\"\n\n10.\n\nIn accordance with the agreement reached at the first session of October 23, 2004 regarding the dates for the filing of the parties' written pleadings on the Application, the Centre received on December 23, 2004 the Claimant's CounterMemorial in response to the Application, on February 23, 2005 the Reply of the Democratic Republic of Congo to the Counter-Memorial of Mr. Patrick Mitchell, and on March 23, 2005 the Claimant's Rejoinder to the Reply of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n11.\n\nBoth parties submitted documentation in support of their respective arguments. They also requested that the Centre transmit to the *ad hoc* Committee, in accordance with item 14 of the Minutes of the first session, certain documents from the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal. On March 4, 2005, the Centre sent to the *ad hoc* Committee copies of all written pleadings exchanged by the parties before the Arbitral Tribunal, as well as, in accordance with the DRC's request in its Reply of February 23, 2005, copies of certain exhibits from the arbitration proceedings that it had identified.\n\n12.\n\nA hearing devoted to oral arguments of counsel to the parties was held in Paris on May 11, 2005, in which participated Mr. Emmanuel Gaillard assisted by Ms. Yas Banifatemi and Ms. Anna Crevon for the Claimant, and Mr. Tshibangu Kalala, Mr. Nicolas Angelet, and Mr. Joe Sepulchre for the Respondent. The hearing was conducted in French, as all the participants preferred to express themselves in that language; however, simultaneous interpretation into English was provided in accordance with item 7 of the Minutes of the first session. A transcript in French of the oral arguments was transmitted to the parties for any possible comments that they had in this respect to be submitted by June 20, 2005. The parties' comments concerned mostly questions of form and did not lead to further discussions.\n\n13.\n\nDue to the non-payment by the DRC of the amounts requested by the Centre in accordance with Regulation 14(3) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, the proceeding was suspended on September 21, 2005 by virtue of the above Regulation. The requested payment was finally made by the DRC and the proceeding was resumed on September 19, 2006. As the presentation of the case by the parties had been already completed, the proceeding was declared closed on September 26, 2006 in accordance with Rule 38 of the Arbitration Rules, applied in accordance with Rule 53 of the Rules.\n\n**C. The Application for Annulment**\n------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo requests that the *ad hoc* Committee annul the Award of February 9, 2004 on the basis of Article 52(1) of the Convention, more specifically on the grounds set out under paragraphs 1(b) and 1(e). It further requests that all costs in the annulment proceeding be borne by the Claimant, and that he be ordered to reimburse the DRC for all its costs, including its legal fees.\n\n15.\n\nThe grounds on which the Application for Annulment was based were reduced during the proceedings. In its Application dated June 7, 2004, the DRC cited the following grounds:\n\n(i) Manifest excess of powers with regard to the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction in respect of the definition of investment;\n\n(ii) Manifest excess of powers with regard to the identity of the Claimant and with regard to the \"arising directly out of\" relationship between the dispute and the investment;\n\n(iii) Manifest excess of powers with regard to the law applicable to the dispute;\n\n(iv) Manifest excess of powers with regard to the failure to apply Article VII(3) of the BIT to the dispute for purposes of determining the admissibility of the request of Mr. Patrick Mitchell; and\n\n(v) Failure to state reasons for the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Arbitral Tribunal with regard to the identity of the Claimant, the characterization of the measures under dispute as expropriation, and the amount of compensable damages.\n\n16.\n\nSubsequently, in its Reply to the Counter-Memorial of Mr. Patrick Mitchell dated February 23, 2005, the DRC dropped its second ground for annulment based on a manifest excess of powers with regard to the \"arising directly out of\" relationship between the dispute and the investment in view of the identity of the Claimant; it also abandoned its fourth ground for annulment based on a manifest excess of powers for failure to apply Article VII(3) of the BIT to the dispute. The Respondent further dropped the second part of its fifth ground for annulment, based on the failure to state reasons regarding the identity of the Claimant.\n\n17.\n\nIn the final analysis, the Respondent's grounds for annulment are the following:\n\n(i) Manifest excess of powers with regard to the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction in respect of the definition of investment;\n\n(ii) Manifest excess of powers with regard to the law applicable to the dispute; and\n\n(iii) Failure to state reasons for the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Arbitral Tribunal with regard to the characterization of the measures under dispute as expropriation, and the amount of compensable damages.\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimant, Mr. Patrick Mitchell, opposes the arguments of the DRC and considers the Application for Annulment to be abusive, arguing that the Respondent seeks to review the merits of the Award. He therefore requests that the *ad hoc* Committee reject all grounds for annulment invoked by the DRC and, pursuant to Article 52(4) and of Chapter VI of the Convention, have the Respondent bear all the costs of this proceeding, including legal fees.\n\n**D. Principles and Structure of the Present Decision**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee considers it appropriate to discuss briefly its role within the annulment system established by Article 52 of the Washington Convention. No one has the slightest doubt - all the *ad hoc* Committees have so stated, and all authors specializing in the ICSID arbitration system agree - that an annulment proceeding is different from an appeal procedure and that it does not entail the carrying out of a substantive review of an award. In the case at hand, the parties, while agreeing in principle on such distinction, have turned their attention to this issue on a number of occasions; indeed, the grounds invoked by the Respondent in respect of the Award are sometimes based on arguments which touch upon the merits of the case. The *ad hoc* Committee is fully aware of the risk to which the nature of this case exposes it. Nor is there any doubt that the grounds for annulment set out in Article 52 must be examined in a neutral and reasonable manner, that is, neither narrowly nor extensively.1 An *ad hoc* Committee should not decide to annul an award unless it is convinced that there has been a substantial violation of a rule protected by Article 52. In this case, the grounds invoked for annulment by the Respondent are, on one hand, manifest excess of powers, Article 52(1)(b), which the Arbitral Tribunal allegedly committed in respect of its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and in respect of the law applicable to the dispute, and, on the other hand, the failure to state reasons, Article 52(1)(e), relating to the Award as regards jurisdiction, the qualification as an expropriation of the disputed measures and the valuation of the compensation.\n\nAlong these lines, see *Maritime International Nominees Establishment* [MINE] *v. Republic of Guinea* (Case No. ARB/84/4), Decision partially annulling the Award, December 22, 1989, 5 ICSID Rev. -Foreign Inv. L. J. 95 (1990); *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on Application for Annulment, February 5, 2002, 41 I.L.M. 933 (2002); *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, 19 ICSID Rev. - Foreign Inv. L. J. 89 (2004).\n\n20.\n\nAs regards the ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) raised by the Respondent with respect to jurisdiction, it is here a question of the positive and habitual aspect of the excess of powers whereby the Arbitral Tribunal is reproached for having done what it did not have the right to do, namely in that it declared itself competent on the basis of an investment which was not one. In contrast, as regards the same ground raised with respect to the applicable law, it is a question of the negative aspect of the excess of powers: the Arbitral Tribunal is reproached for not having done what it was obligated to do, namely in that it did not examine all the provisions of the Treaty. In the context of Article 52, however, the excess of powers has no consequence unless it is manifest.2 If an excess of powers is to be the cause of an annulment, the *ad hoc* Committee must so find with certainty and immediacy, without it being necessary to engage in elaborate analyses of the award.3\n\nOn the meaning of the term \"manifest,\" the *ad hoc* Committee provides the following dictionary definitions. In French: \" *dont l'existence ou la nature est \u00e9vidente. V. certain, \u00e9vident, indiscutable, visible\"* (Le Robert) and especially (Cornu) : *\" criant ; qui appelle et justifie incontestablement une intervention, une r\u00e9action\"* or (with a different nuance) *\"grave parce que n\u00e9cessairement perceptible, grossier, flagrant.\"* In English: \" *plain, open, clearly visible to the eye or obvious to the understanding; apparent; not obscure or difficult to be seen or understood\"* (Webster's); \" *Manifest means easily noticed or obvious\"* (Cambridge International Dictionary of English).\n\nAlong these lines, see *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt, op. cit.,* note 1\n\n21.\n\nAs regards the ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) invoked by the Respondent in respect of jurisdiction, the qualification of the measures under dispute as an expropriation and the valuation of the compensation, the *ad hoc* Committee is of the opinion that a failure to state reasons exists whenever reasons are purely and simply not given, or are so inadequate that the coherence of the reasoning is seriously affected. In other words, the Committee embraces the position adopted by the *ad hoc* Committee in the *MINE* case,4 according to which *\"the requirement that an Award* *has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of* *the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that.* [...] *This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\"* Indeed, it is evident that a seriously contradictory reasoning would be equivalent to a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e), provided that the contradiction is at the same time apparent, to a point such that the *ad hoc* Committee cannot be reproached for engaging in an analysis of the merits.\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment* [MINE] *v. Republic of Guinea, op. cit.,* note 1.\n\n22.\n\nThe Application for Annulment includes various criticism of the Award that relates to the two grounds for annulment under 1(b) and 1(e) of Article 52. Since the existence of an investment, which is a condition for the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction, and the law applicable to the expropriation are both contested by the Respondent on the basis of the two grounds for annulment taken cumulatively, the *ad hoc* Committee is of the opinion that its consideration of the matter will be more orderly and efficient if it focuses its analysis first on the issue of jurisdiction/investment as regards the two grounds (Chapter II), secondly on the applicable law/expropriation as regards the same two grounds (Chapter III), and finally on the valuation of the compensation as regards the second ground alone (Chapter IV). The relevant paragraphs of the Award will be indicated in parentheses in the text which follows.\n\n**II. Manifest Excess of Power and Failure to State Reasons with Regard toJurisdiction: The \"Investment\"**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The findings of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nAs mentioned in the Award itself, the Respondent argued that the dispute did not fall within the jurisdiction of ICSID or the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal. More specifically, the Respondent maintained first that the activity of the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm could not be qualified as an investment because by its nature it did not contribute to the economic and social development of the host State; in other words, this activity may have contributed to the promotion of the investor himself, but could not in any way contribute to the economic benefit of Congo (para. 34). Second, the Respondent maintained that the legal counseling activity of the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm could not be considered as a commercial activity covered by the Treaty between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the United States (para. 35). Third, the Respondent contended that the notion of \"service\" used in the Treaty should be understood to be a commercial or economic service related to investments, and that legal consulting cannot constitute an activity covered by this notion (para. 36). Fourth and last, the Respondent maintained that the activity of the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm did not satisfy the objective requirements of an investment, given the fact that such activity did not constitute a long-term operation nor was it materialized by a significant contribution of resources, and that it was not of such importance for the country's economy that it distinguished itself from an ordinary commercial transaction (para. 37).\n\n24.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee deems it worthwhile to cite below a number of extracts from the Award in which the Arbitral Tribunal examined the arguments of the Respondent and ultimately concluded that it did have jurisdiction, which passages were those discussed most extensively in the context of the criticisms of the Award:\n\n\"47. The Tribunal has received ample information about the activities exercised by Mr. Mitchell in the DRC, which allow it to answer the question concerning the existence of an investment of the Claimant in the DRC. These elements of information include in particular the declarations made by the former clients of the firm, the agreements concluded with former associates who left the firm in 1991 and the income statements for the years 1996 to 1998.\n\n48. The Tribunal finds that in respect of items of Mr. Mitchell's property seized during the intervention of the military forces on March 5, 1999, the requirement listed under Article I(c)(i) of the BIT is met. This concerns movable property and any documents, like files, records and similar items. It further appears from the text of the provision as quoted that the investor's right to \"know-how\" and \"goodwill\" (iv) as well as the right to exercise its activities (vi) are elements which are stated as being covered by the protection of investments under the BIT. This concerns also the payments registered on the accounts of Mr. Mitchell in the United States to which Claimant refers in order to demonstrate his activity within the DRC. Indeed, these payments are based on bills for fees referring to legal consultations provided by Mr. Mitchell and his employees through the office \"Mitchell & Associates\" within the DRC.\n\n[...]\n\n53. It appears therefore to the Tribunal that in the absence of any indication directing to the exclusion from the scope of the Treaty of particular activities that may be considered as services, such a concept should be given a broad meaning, covering all services provided by a foreign investor on the territory of the host State. In this respect, the concept of service is a notion proper to the BIT. There is no indication that such a concept should be interpreted in light of other agreements containing the notion of services, like those concluded within the GATT or WTO, where such a notion is used for other purposes, different from those which were prevalent at the time of the signing of the BIT in 1984. Therefore, the services typically offered by a firm providing legal advice as did the Claimant's firm are covered by the notion of services used by the BIT.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n55. The Tribunal can draw from these elements of definition the conclusion that the BIT contains a definition of the notion of investment which is as broad as the concept is used in the ICSID Convention. In addition to movable property, Claimant transferred into Congo money and other assets which constituted the foundations for his professional activities which came to an end the day of the seizure of his firm or soon thereafter. Together with the returns on the initial investments, which also qualify as investments (see Article I(c) of the BIT), these activities and the economic value associated therewith qualify as an investment within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n56. The Respondent further argues that Claimant's activity does not qualify as an investment as it does not satisfy the objective requirements in this respect. Respondent mentions the fact that such activity does not constitute a long-term operation nor is it materialized by a significant contribution of resources, and that it is not of such importance for the State's economy that it distinguishes itself from an ordinary commercial transaction. The Tribunal notes, however, that these elements, while they are frequently present in investment projects, are not a formal requirement for the finding that a particular activity or transaction constitutes an investment. Such a concept, as long as it is not supplemented by the appropriate restrictions, does equally include, under the ICSID Convention, and, as demonstrated, under the BIT, \"smaller\" investments of shorter duration and with more limited benefit to the host State's economy.\n\n57. The Tribunal concludes, accordingly, that Mr. Mitchell's property detained in the Offices of Mitchell & Associates and the resources and activities related to this firm qualify as an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Therefore, the Tribunal decides that this dispute is within the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Tribunal.\"\n\n**B. The Analysis of the** ***ad hoc*** **Committee**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Investment in the Context of ICSID**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nIn accordance with Article 25(1) of the Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre depends upon the existence of a dispute \"arising directly out of an investment.\" Reference to this article at the outset is unavoidable; this is what the Arbitral Tribunal also did, and then went on to observe and recall that there is no definition of investment contained in the Convention. Indeed, in the case at hand the question is not so much one of determining whether there is an \"arising directly out of\" relationship, but rather whether there is an \"investment.\" In the opinion of the *ad hoc* Committee, in view of the absence in the Convention of an explicit definition of the concept of investment, it is in the parties' agreement or in the applicable investment treaty that one should look for such definition, whether it is broad or less broad. In doing so, the fact that a State has not made use of the notification option provided for under Article 25(4) of the Convention may not be understood to mean that that State has taken a certain position regarding the very concept of investment. It is then necessary to verify the conformity of the concept of investment as set out in the parties' agreement or in the BIT with the concept of investment in the Washington Convention, as this latter results from the interpretation of the Convention in accordance with Article 31.1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, as well as from ICSID case law, to the extent the latter may contribute to defining the concept. Indeed, such concept of investment should prevail over any other 'definition' of investment in the parties' agreement or in the BIT, as it is obvious that the special and privileged arrangements established by the Washington Convention can be applied only to the type of investment which the Contracting States to that Convention envisaged.\n\n(a) The Relevant Provisions of the BIT between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the United States\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nIn the case at hand, there is no direct agreement between Mr. Mitchell and the DRC, but the bilateral Treaty between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the United States contains, in its Article VII, the offer made by each State to potential investors of the other State to settle their disputes through the ICSID mechanism. This Treaty, like most treaties of its type, contains an enumerative and non exhaustive approach to investment, which makes it possible to apply the protection provided by the Treaty to a range of rights and assets of the foreign investor. But it does not contain, properly speaking, a definition of investment as such. The relevant provisions of the Treaty are found in its Article I (\"Definitions\") under item (c) and in its Article II (\"Treatment of Investment\") under item 2. These provisions provide as follows:\n\n**\"Article I Definitions**\n\nFor the purposes of this Treaty:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(c) \"Investment\" means every kind of investment, owned or controlled directly or indirectly, including equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:\n\n(i) tangible and intangible property, including all property rights, such as liens, mortgages, pledges, and real security;\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;\n\n(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;\n\n(iv) intellectual and industrial property rights, including rights with respect to copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade names, industrial designs, trades secrets and know how, and goodwill;\n\n(v) licenses and permits issued pursuant to law, including those issued for manufacture and sale of products;\n\n(vi) any right conferred by law or contract, including rights to search for or utilize natural resources, and rights to manufacture, use and sell products; and\n\n(vii) returns which are reinvested.\n\nAny alteration of the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect their character as investment.\"\n\n**\"Article II Treatment of Investment**\n\n[\u2026]\n\n2. Each Party shall accord existing or new investments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Party, and associated activities, treatment no less favorable than that which it accords to investments and associated activities of its own nationals or companies or of nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the most favorable.\n\nAssociated activities include:\n\n(a) the establishment, control and maintenance of branches, agencies, offices, factors or other facilities for the conduct of business;\n\n(b) the organization of companies under applicable national laws and regulations; the acquisition of companies or interests in companies; the management, control, maintenance, use, and expansion, and the sale, liquidation, and dissolution of companies organized or acquired;\n\n(c) the making, performance and enforcement of contract;\n\n(d) the acquisition (whether by purchase, lease or otherwise), possession with rights of ownership, and disposition (whether by sale, testament or otherwise), of property, both tangible and intangible;\n\n(e) the leasing of real property required for the conduct of business;\n\n(f) the acquisition, maintenance, and protection of intellectual property rights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, trade names, licenses and other approvals of products and manufacturing processes, and other industrial property rights; and\n\n(g) the borrowing of funds, the purchase and issuance of equity shares, and the purchase of foreign exchange for imports.\"\n\n(b) Characteristics of the Investment under the Washington Convention\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThere are four characteristics of investment identified by ICSID case law5 and commented on by legal doctrine,6 but in reality they are interdependent and are consequently examined comprehensively. The first characteristic of investment is the commitment of the investor, which may be financial or through work; indeed, in several ICSID cases the investor's commitment mainly consisted in its know-how.7 Other characteristics of investment are the duration of the project and the economic risk entailed, in the sense of an uncertainty regarding its successful outcome. The fourth characteristic of investment is the contribution to the economic development of the host country, a matter which the *ad hoc* Committee will review at some length in that it is a key point of the debates in the Annulment Proceedings. Indeed, while the Respondent regards the contribution to economic development as an \"essential element\" of investment which, if found wanting, must prompt the Arbitral Tribunal to declare that it lacks jurisdiction,8 the Claimant Mr. Patrick Mitchell regards this contribution to economic development - which he does not contest constitutes one of the criteria for the existence of an investment9 - as a supplementary condition used heretofore in order to justify the broadening of the concept of investment and as somewhat duplicating with the investor's commitment.10\n\n*Fedax N.V. v.

Similarly, in the *Fedax* case,12 which involved promissory notes issued by the Republic of Venezuela to guarantee a loan equivalent to their amount, the arbitral tribunal observed that: \" *It* *is quite apparent that the transactions involved in this case are not ordinary* *commercial transactions and indeed involve a fundamental public interest* [...] *There is clearly a significant relationship between the transaction and the development of the host State.* \" Finally, in the *CSOB* case,13 which involved a \u2018consolidation agreement' between the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the Czechoslovak bank *CSOB*, with each of the two new States guaranteeing the reimbursement of the loan granted by *CSOB* to its national Collection Company, the Arbitral Tribunal observed that: \" *Under certain circumstances a loan may contribute substantially to a State's economic development* [\u2026] [The] *undertaking involved a significant contribution by CSOB to the economic development of the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the Convention.* \" While it is true that in these cases, where explicit reference was made to the \"contribution to the economic development of the host State,\" the concept of investment was somewhat 'broadened,' this does nothing to alter the fundamental nature of that characteristic. It is thus found that, in another group of cases where the contribution to the economic development of the host State had not been mentioned expressly, it was doubtless covered by the very purpose of the contracts in question -all of which were State contracts - which had an obvious and unquestioned impact on the development of the host State.14\n\n*Salini Construttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v.

It is thus repeated that, before ICSID arbitral tribunals, the Washington Convention has supremacy over an agreement between the parties or a BIT.\n\n*Op. cit.,* note 6, \u00a7 88, p. 124: *\"The only possible indication of an objective meaning that can be gleaned from the Convention is contained in the Preamble's first sentence, which speaks of \"the need for international co-operation for economic development and the role of private international* *investment therein\" Therefore, it may be argued that the Convention's object and purpose indicate* *that there should be some positive impact on development.\"*\n\n32.\n\nThis said, the problem does not arise in the case at hand, since not only are the aforementioned provisions of the Bilateral Treaty between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the United States altogether usual and in no way exorbitant, but the same Treaty also recognizes clearly in its Preamble\n\n\"that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded such investment will stimulate the flow of private capital and the economic development of both Parties.\"\n\nMoreover, this is a provision that appears in all bilateral treaties signed by the United States, and was even emphasized in the Preamble to the *2004 Model BIT.*16\n\n*\"The Government of the United States of America and the Government of [Country] (hereinafter the \"Parties\"):*  \n*Desiring to promote greater economic cooperation between them with respect to investment by nationals and enterprises of one Party in the territory of the other Party;*  \n*Recognising that agreement on the treatment to be accorded such investment will stimulate the flow of private capital and the economic development of the Parties;*  \n*Agreeing that a stable framework for investment will maximize effective utilization of economic* *resources and improve living standards;* [\u2026]\"\n\n33.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee wishes nevertheless to specify that, in its view, the existence of a contribution to the economic development of the host State as an essential - although not sufficient - characteristic or unquestionable criterion of the investment, does not mean that this contribution must always be sizable or successful; and, of course, ICSID tribunals do not have to evaluate the real contribution of the operation in question. It suffices for the operation to contribute in one way or another to the economic development of the host State, and this concept of economic development is, in any event, extremely broad but also variable depending on the case.\n\n**2. The Reasoning of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nIt bears recalling that the case at hand did not involve a *\"readily recognizable\"*17 investment, as it concerned a legal counseling firm established by a U.S. citizen in the DRC. It is the first time that such an operation was considered within the special arbitration system of ICSID as a dispute between a State and an investor from another State. Moreover, during the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal, the DRC had concretely contested the existence of an investment, mainly in respect of the criterion of the contribution to the economic development of the country18.\n\nAron Broches, cited by Christoph Schreuer, *op. cit.,* note 6, \u00a7 86, p. 124: \"[\u2026] *Mr. Broches recalled* *that none of the suggested definitions of the word \"investment\" had proved acceptable. He suggested* *that while it might be difficult to define the term, an investment was in fact readily recognizable.\"*\n\nCounter-Memorial of September 3, 2001, p. 8, 11 and 12; Counter-Memorial in Response of April 8, 2002, p. 7; Counter-Memorial in Reply of January 7, 2003, p. 9.\n\n35.\n\nThe Award (paras. 48 and 55 cited above) identifies as elements constituting Mr. Patrick Mitchell's investment:\n\n- the movable property and any documents, like files, records and similar items, of the firm, as per item I(c)(i) of the BIT;\n\n- rights with respect to know-how and goodwill as well as the right to exercise his activities, as per item I(c)(iv);\n\n- the payments registered on the accounts of Mr. Patrick Mitchell in the United States, which came from fees referring to legal consultations provided within the DRC.\n\n36.\n\nWith the exception of the payments, to which the *ad hoc* Committee will return later, the elements identified by the Award for purposes of affirming the existence of an investment fall well within the scope of application of the Treaty as they are \"included\" in the term \"investment\" pursuant to Article I(c) of the Treaty. But do these elements, absent further discussion, make it possible to affirm the existence of an investment within the meaning of the Washington Convention?\n\n37.\n\nAs the DRC has contested whether legal consulting services come within the notion of \"services\" included in the introductory portion of item I(c) of the Treaty, the Arbitral Tribunal considered that the concept of service must be broad in scope, including \"any service provided by a foreign investor,\" and especially the services normally provided by a legal consulting firm, as was the case of the Claimant's firm (para. 53). The *ad hoc* Committee cannot but observe two things: first, that resolving the question of application of the concept of service within the meaning of the Treaty to legal consulting services by stating that this concept embraces \"any service provided by a foreign investor,\" is to fall into a vicious circle, inasmuch as the Award does not explain why in this case the Claimant was an investor; and second, that item I(c) of the Treaty speaks of \"every kind of investment, [\u2026] including [\u2026] service and investment contracts,\" and not of \"every kind of service.\" This said, it is easy to follow the Award as regards the inclusion of a legal consulting firm within the concept of service, but that is not the issue at hand.\n\n38.\n\nIn the opinion of the *ad hoc* Committee, one should avoid confusing the economic operation or project - which, if it fulfills certain characteristics, becomes the investment within the meaning of the Convention and the Treaty, even if it is \"smaller\" and \"of shorter duration and with more limited benefit to the host State's economy\" (para. 56) - with all the rights and assets protected by the Treaty because they are part of the operation or project, or concern the same in one way or another. In this case, by the nature of things, it is the services of the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm that would or would not constitute the investment within the meaning of the Convention and the Treaty, and certainly not the minimal 'investment' in the strictly economic sense of the term that Mr. Patrick Mitchell made with a view to establishing and exercising his profession in the DRC. It is true that the latter would be protected by the Treaty, but because it related to the operation or project constituting the investment. However, nothing is said in the Award about the content of the services of the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm that would justify the decision to qualify them as an investment.\n\n39.\n\nAs a legal consulting firm is a somewhat uncommon operation from the standpoint of the concept of investment, in the opinion of the *ad hoc* Committee it is necessary for the contribution to the economic development or at least the interests of the State, in this case the DRC, to be somehow present in the operation. If this were the case, qualifying the Claimant as an investor and his services as an investment would be possible; furthermore, it would be necessary for the Award to indicate that, through his know-how, the Claimant had concretely assisted the DRC, for example by providing it with legal services in a regular manner or by specifically bringing investors. It does appear, according to the statements of both parties,19 that some U.S. investors had indeed consulted the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm. However, the Award itself is actually mute on this issue. The vague indication set forth in para. 47 of the Award, to the effect that the Arbitral Tribunal had received ample information about the activities exercised by Mr. Mitchell, including in particular the declarations made by former clients of the firm, the agreements concluded with former associates, and income statements, fail to fill this gap. The same holds true as regards the passing reference made in para. 71 of the Award with respect to the loss of clients, according to which \"many clients had been asking the firm for counseling in relation to requests to be presented to State authorities.\"\n\nSee, for the Claimant, the transcript of the hearing of May 11, 2005, p. 20, and for the Respondent, its Reply to the Counter-Memorial of Mr. Patrick Mitchell of February 23, 2005, p. 43.\n\n40.\n\nThe Award is incomplete and obscure as regards what it considers an investment: it refers to various fragments of the operation, without finally indicating the reasons why it regards it overall as an investment, that is, without providing the slightest explanation as to the relationship between the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm and the DRC. Such an inadequacy of reasons is deemed to be particularly grave, as it seriously affects the coherence of the reasoning and, moreover, as it opens the door to a risk of genuine abuses, to the extent that it boils down to granting the qualification as investor to any legal counseling firm or law firm established in a foreign country, thereby enabling it to take advantage of the special arbitration system of ICSID.\n\n41.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee thus concludes that the Award is tainted by a failure to state reasons, in the sense that the inadequacy of reasons is such that it seriously affects the coherence of the reasoning as to the existence of an investment in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Convention and the Bilateral Treaty between the United States of America and the Democratic Republic of Congo, on which relied the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n**3. Excess of Power? Manifest Excess of Power?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee now reverts to the question of the returns of the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm as an element constituting the investment identified by the Arbitral Tribunal as above in para. 48 of the Award:\n\n\"[\u2026] are elements which are stated as being covered by the protection of investments under the BIT. This concerns also the payments registered on the accounts of Mr. Mitchell in the United States.\"\n\nThis conclusion is repeated in para. 55 of the Award where, again with reference to movable property, money, and other assets which the Claimant had transferred into the DRC for purposes of establishing his firm, the Arbitral Tribunal adds the following sentence:\n\n\"Together with the returns on the initial investments, which also qualify as investments (see Article I(c) of the BIT), these activities and the economic value associated therewith qualify as an investment within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\"\n\nThe returns are thus, it clearly appears, deemed by the Arbitral Tribunal to be an element constituting the investment, even though the returns in question were, according to the Award itself (para. 48), registered on the accounts of Mr. Patrick Mitchell in the United States and, moreover, Mr. Mitchell never referred to his returns before the Arbitral Tribunal in order to establish ICSID jurisdiction (as it clearly results from paras. 38-39 of the Award concerning the position of the Claimant).\n\n43.\n\nThe finding of the Arbitral Tribunal on this point is rather surprising, in that Article I(c) of the BIT includes in the concept of investment under item (vii) \"returns which are reinvested.\" Consequently, 'non-reinvested' returns cannot be included in the concept of investment and be protected by the Treaty. This *a contrario* interpretation of one of the items on an enumerative list, even one that is not exhaustive, is fully in keeping with the logic and the spirit of a BIT and is equivalent to an interpretation \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose,\" in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969, which codifies a rule of customary international law.20\n\nAlong these lines, see International Court of Justice, *Case Concerning the Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989,* 12 November 1991, (Guinea-Bissau v. Senegal), Rec. 1991 \u00a748 [in French], English summary at http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/icases/igbs/igbs\\_isummaries/igbs\\_isummary\\_19911112.htm.\n\n44.\n\nThe discussion of the returns of Mr. Patrick Mitchell identified as an element of his investment led, during the Annulment Proceedings, to another question on which the Respondent placed great emphasis. This is the Claimant's sheltering of his income from Congolese taxation, alleged by the Respondent in support of its ground of manifest excess of power as to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal in respect of the definition of the investment: not only did the Claimant in no way contribute to the economic development of the Respondent, but by removing his income from the latter's tax system he \"knowingly and voluntarily acted against the development of the DRC.\"21 This argument was not raised by the Respondent during the proceedings on the merits; moreover, tax avoidance - assuming it to have existed - however shocking it may be in the eyes of the DRC, relates to the merits of the case and in any event is not determining as to the existence *per se* of an investment. Consequently, the *ad hoc* Committee need not express an opinion on this argument by the Respondent.\n\nRespondent's Reply to the Counter-Memorial of Mr. Patrick Mitchell of February 23, 2005, p. 44\n\n45.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee has already identified a serious failure to state reasons as to the existence of an investment on which the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal would be based. If this had not been the case and the Award had been adequately and cohesively reasoned as to the existence of an investment by the Claimant, the error committed by the Arbitral Tribunal as to the inclusion of non-reinvested returns in the notion of investment could not be identified as a manifest excess of power. An *ad hoc* Committee ought not to sanction an error of interpretation of the Treaty - as awkward as it may be - when, even in the absence of such error, the result would have been the same.\n\n46.\n\nBut here the error is certainly not one of inadvertence and compounds the failure to state reasons. It is an arbitrary reference, made two or even three times in the Award (paras. 48, 55, and 57 less clearly, in speaking of \"resources\"), to the returns collected by the Claimant in the United States being treated as an element constituting the investment, which runs counter to the clear and precise provision of the Treaty and compounds reasoning which is already incomplete and obscure. The *ad hoc* Committee is thus inclined to believe that the Arbitral Tribunal forced the concept of investment in the case at hand in order to affirm its jurisdiction. This is perhaps attributable to the discomfort engendered in the Arbitral Tribunal by the factual circumstances of the case, namely the violent dispossession of the Claimant's property and good will. The fact remains, however, that this combination of flaws in the Award is such that an excess of power on the part of the Arbitral Tribunal must be acknowledged.\n\n47.\n\nIt is a manifest excess of power: on the first reading of the Award, even before examining the Treaty, questions arise as to the basis for the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal in general, and the reader is disconcerted to find that returns received in the United States and non-reinvested in the host State are identified as an element of the investment within the meaning of a Bilateral Investment Treaty.\n\n48.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee is thus obligated to annul the Award of February 9, 2004 due to the failure to state reasons and manifest excess of powers committed by the Arbitral Tribunal in its decision to declare itself competent. It is evident that this annulment, as it concerns the very jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, cannot but relate to the Award as a whole, making it somewhat superfluous to examine the other criticisms expressed by the DRC about the Award. However, given the importance of certain arguments debated between the parties in respect of these criticisms, the *ad hoc* Committee deems it useful to discuss the other grounds briefly. Needless to say, the discussion which follows is written as if the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm did constitute a genuine investment and the Arbitral Tribunal properly considered that it had jurisdiction.\n\n**III. Manifest Excess of Power and Failure to State Reasons with Regard to the Applicable Law: The \"Expropriation\"**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Non-Application of Article X(1) of the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Committee finds that it is in consideration of the facts and in application of Article III(1) of the Treaty on \"Compensation for Expropriation\" - the standard provision of all BITs regarding the undertaking of States not to expropriate or nationalize an investment or subject it to \"any other measure or series of measures, direct or indirect, tantamount to expropriation,\" except under certain conditions including \"done for a public purpose\" and \"accompanied by prompt, adequate, and effectively realizable compensation\" - that the Arbitral Tribunal decided (para. 71) that:\n\n\"[\u2026] the measures taken by the military authorities of the DRC are tantamount to an expropriation of Mr. Mitchell's investment, including the loss of clients who no longer made use of the services provided by the firm.\"\n\n50.\n\nThe DRC argues that the Award failed to take into account Article X(1) of the Treaty on \"Measures not precluded by this Treaty.\" This article provides as follows:\n\n\"This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary in its territory for the maintenance of public order and morality, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance and restoration of international peace and security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.\"\n\n**1. The Ground of Manifest Excess of Power**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Article X(1) effectively determines the scope of application of the Treaty and makes it completely nonapplicable, or determines the scope of exclusion from it and consequently makes Article III nonapplicable. In substance, the DRC argues that Article X(1) determines the range of the undertakings engaged in by the States under Article III; that the Treaty, being the applicable law according to the Award, constitutes a \"body of rules\" that should have been taken into consideration by the Arbitral Tribunal in its entirety. This is especially so because the DRC had expressly called the attention of the Arbitral Tribunal to the state of war in the Congo and had made reference to the circumstances making the disputed measures necessary in order to address what it characterized as a \"threat to State security.\" Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal would have had before it all the information necessary - not to forget the international press, which was focusing attention on the armed conflict in Congo and its relations with the exploitations of that country's natural resources - to bring Article X of the Treaty to bear. In not having done so, still according to the Respondent, it manifestly exceeded its powers as regards the applicable law.\n\n52.\n\nThe Award devotes an entire chapter to the concept of expropriation. While the Award does not provide an analysis of the Treaty and its Article III(1), one can easily understand why the sealing of the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm, the seizure of documents considered to be compromising, and the imprisonment of two lawyers, as well as the subsequent loss of clients by the firm, were deemed by the Award to be a measure equivalent to an expropriation. Parenthetically, the *ad hoc* Committee notes that seizure is commonly taken to constitute a measure equivalent to expropriation.22 Indeed, the Arbitral Tribunal dealt only with the effect that the measure had for the 'investor', that is, privation from the use of his 'investment', in order to consider such privation equivalent to an expropriation. It did not concern itself with the finality of that measure in the eyes of the judiciary of the DRC that handed it down, which was to investigate a presumed criminal violation and punish it. The Arbitral Tribunal did not assess the possibility of regarding this not as a measure equivalent to an expropriation, but as a court measure that was driven by circumstances and was temporary, separate from any desire of the host State to threaten an investment, a measure which caused Mr. Mitchell and two Congolese nationals to suffer irreparable damages in the context of an ICSID proceeding.\n\nSee, *inter alia,* an explicit discussion in document ACP-CEE 2172/92 of the Council of the European Communities entitled *\"Community Position on Investment Protection Principles in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States,\"* Brussels, November 3, 1992, which was drawn up in the context of the Lom\u00e9 IV Convention to establish a basis and provide advice for the negotiation of bilateral treaties:  \n*\"4. Expropriation (i) Scope of \"expropriation\": Protection against expropriation should extend to any measures attributable to the host government which have the effect of depriving an investor of his ownership or control of, or a substantial benefit from, his investment. This formula is intended to capture myriad forms of expropriation, including nationalisation, confiscation, sequestration, seizure and attachment.\"*\n\n53.\n\nHowever, the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal focused solely on the impact that the measure had on the 'investment' corresponds to the application of the tantamount principle which is consistent with the spirit of investment treaties, namely the protection of investors. It bears noting in this regard that the 1992 Directives of the World Bank23 had already expressly mentioned \"measures which have similar effects\" and that a number of investment treaties also explicitly refer to \"measures of tantamount effect.\"24 It also bears noting that in the case of *Metalclad v. Mexico,* concerning the application of Article 1110 of the NAFTA Treaty which is similar to Article III(1) of the BIT (without mention of the effect), the Arbitral Tribunal made reference only to the effect of the measure for the investor, without taking into account the purpose sought by the expropriating authority.25 This appears to be a practice of arbitrators - at present a majority of them - in international investment disputes when they are assessing the tantamount character.26\n\n*\"Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment Issued by the Development Committee,\"* 7 ICSID Rev. - Foreign Inv. L. J. 295 (1992), Section IV, *\"Expropriation and unilateral alterations or* *termination of contracts,\" \u00a7 1: \"A State may not expropriate or otherwise take in whole or in part a foreign private investment in its territory, or take measures which have similar effects, except where this is done in accordance with applicable legal procedures, in pursuance in good faith of a public purpose, without discrimination on the basis of nationality and against payment of appropriate compensation.\"*\n\nThis is the case, for example, of the bilateral investment protection treaties concluded between the United States and Senegal, the United States and Tunisia, the United States and Mozambique; it is also the case for the document of the Council of the European Communities entitled *\"Community Position on Investment Protection Principles in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States,\" op. cit.,* note 21; furthermore, it is the case of the bilateral treaties concluded by France, the Greco-Egyptian treaty (See *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (Case No. ARB/99/6), Award, April 12, 2002, 18 ICSID Rev. - Foreign Inv. L. J 602 (2003)), as well as the BIT between Burundi and the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union (See *Antoine Goetz and others v. Republic of Burundi* (Case No, ARB/95/3), Award embodying the parties' settlement agreement, February 10, 1999, 15 ICSID Rev. - Foreign Inv. L. J 457 (2000)).\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States*, (Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1), Award, August 30, 2000, 16 ICSID Rev. - Foreign Inv. L. J. 168 (2001): *\"Thus, expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use ofproperty which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\"*\n\nSee Yves Nouvel, \" *Les mesures \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 une expropriation dans la pratique r\u00e9cente des tribunaux arbitraux,\"* RGDIP 2002, pp. 79 et seq.\n\n54.\n\nIn any event, regardless of the various positions adopted in legal doctrine and case law on the question of determining whether the effect should be the sole and unique criterion to be used in assessing an indirect expropriation or a measure tantamount to expropriation, or whether the purpose sought by the State is also to be taken into account, it cannot but be found in the case at hand that the Arbitral Tribunal, in apparently opting for the \"sole effect\" doctrine, was merely exercising its freedom of judgment.\n\n55.\n\nTurning now to what is really argued against the Award, namely the manifest excess of powers as to the applicable law, the Committee finds, first, as clearly set out by the Claimant, that Article X(1) of the Treaty is a provision relating to the causes for exemption from liability, or, in other words, a provision which precludes the wrongfulness of the behavior of the State27 in certain exceptional circumstances, and not a provision which delimits the scope of application of the Treaty. Namely, by application of Article X(1) and following some scrutiny by the Arbitral Tribunal concerning the need for the measures undertaken, the DRC might have been spared the reproach of having violated its international obligation to protect U.S. investors.\n\nSee, for example, International Court of Justice, *Case concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary-Slovakia),* Decision of September 25, 1997, Rec. 1997 \u00a7\u00a7 51-52 : *\"The Court considers, first* *of all, that the state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law for precluding* *the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation. It observes moreover that* *such ground for precluding wrongfulness can only be accepted on an exceptional basis* [...] *Thus, according to the Commission, the state of necessity can only be invoked under certain strictly defined conditions which must be cumulatively satisfied; and the State concerned is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met.\"*\n\n56.\n\nSecond, the Committee finds that Article X(1) was not invoked by the DRC before the Arbitral Tribunal; the DRC simply referred to the measures to maintain order and security in the context of its factual argument as to the legitimacy of dispossessing the Claimant. There is no doubt that, as clearly stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in the *MINE* case,28 the annulment proceeding *\"is not an occasion to* *present arguments and submissions which a party failed to make in the underlying proceedings,\"* but that issue is not raised here in the same manner; this is because while Article X(1) itself was not adduced by the DRC, the threat to State security was actually inserted into the debate before the Arbitral Tribunal through its written pleadings and the documentation it submitted (in particular the decision to remand the charged Mr. Djunga and Mr. Risasi before the Military Court of Order) in order to justify the intervention of the military against the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm. Is it possible to find a manifest excess of powers in the fact that, in these circumstances, the Arbitral Tribunal did not examine Article X(1) of the Treaty?\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment* [MINE] *v. Republic of Guinea, op. cit.,* note 1.\n\n57.\n\nIt is entirely conceivable that, in view of the specific circumstances of the intervention of the military forces against the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm, the well known state of war in Congo,29 and the DRC's contestation of the qualification of the measures under dispute as an expropriation, the Arbitral Tribunal would have been welcome to address *ex proprio motu* the other provisions of the Treaty, which might potentially excuse taking such measures against the Claimant. A comparable approach would have been along the lines of the adage *jura novit curia* - on which the DRC leaned heavily during the Annulment Proceeding - but this could not truly be required of the Arbitral Tribunal, as it is not, strictly speaking, subject to any obligation to apply a rule of law that has not been adduced; this is but an option - and the parties should have been given the opportunity to be heard in this respect - for which reason it is not possible to draw any conclusions from the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal did not exercise it. Furthermore, the *ad hoc* Committee notes that even if the Arbitral Tribunal had examined Article X(1) of the Treaty, if it had checked the need for the measures - regardless of the degree of such a check - and if it had concluded that they were not wrongful, this would not necessarily have had any impact on evaluating the act of dispossessing Mr. Mitchell, and on the need for compensation; possibly, it could have had an influence on the calculation of the amount of such compensation.30 Consequently, it is evident that manifest excess of powers does not apply in this instance.\n\nThis situation was widely known not only through the international press, but also through a series of UN Security Council Resolutions issued during the period of the arbitration proceedings.\n\nSee along these lines, and predating the Washington Convention, A.A. Fatouros, *Government Guarantees to Foreign Investors*, Columbia University Press, 1962, pp. 307 et seq., and far more recently, Dominique Carreau & Patrick Juillard, *\u00ab Droit international \u00e9conomique \u00bb*, 4e \u00e9d., Paris, LGDJ, 1998, and further, bearing witness to the existence of a principle of international law in this regard, the draft articles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts adopted by the International Law Commission and annexed to United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/56/83 of December 12, 2001. Article 27 of that draft reads:  \n*\"Consequences of invoking a circumstance precluding wrongfulness:*  \n*The invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness in accordance with this chapter is without prejudice to:*  \n*(a) Compliance with the obligation in question, if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists;*  \n*(b) The question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question.\"*\n\n**2. The Ground of Failure to State Reasons**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAs regards the ground of failure to state reasons adduced by the Respondent, still as regards the application of Article X(1), it is certain that there can be no serious discussion of \"failure to state reasons\" in the case of a provision not adduced before the Arbitral Tribunal. In the case at hand, the failure to state reasons is all the less warranted given that para. 74 of the Award, even though it is set out in the context of Article III(1) and the criterion of public purpose, the existence of which was contested by the Claimant, seems to the Committee also to cover, implicitly, the scope of Article X(1):\n\n\"On the first point [i.e. \u00a7 73: \"Claimant contends, firstly, that the expropriation he suffered was not made for a public purpose (lit. a)\"], the Tribunal does not have to rule on it since the sole purpose of the claim is to provide Mr. Mitchell with compensation for the prejudice he suffered. It is true that the decision of the Military Court of November 12, 1999 stated that the arrest of Messrs. Risasi and Djunga was not justified and that, with the exception of two cars requisitioned by the army, all items that have been seized had to be returned. Respondent argues, however, that on March 5, 1999, the authorities of the Congo had sufficient reasons to fear for the security of the State and to justify an intervention and an investigation, the principal reason relating to the risk that the product of the sale of the 99 tons of cassiterite would go to SAKIMA SARL, a company which was, in the view of the Congolese authorities, run by certain individuals with ties to the rebellion against the Government of the DRC. The Tribunal does not dispose of enough information to evaluate, under all pertinent angles, the situation as it existed in March 1999. It cannot make a statement, therefore, on Respondent's argument that there existed, at the relevant time a public purpose and a legitimate power of the military forces, based on the Constitution or the Law, that would have justified, at least as a preventive measure, the intervention which did actually occur.\"\n\nSince the Tribunal did not dispose of \"enough information to evaluate, under all pertinent angles, the situation as it existed in March 1999\" as to the existence of a public purpose under Article III(1), it logically also did not have, *a fortiori,* enough information as to a threat to the security of the State under Article X(1) which might have made the measure undertaken \"necessary.\"\n\n59.\n\nFurthermore, the *ad hoc* Committee can only repeat, as mentioned above, that even if it were assumed that the Arbitral Tribunal had examined Article X(1) and had agreed that the measures undertaken were not wrongful, this would not have ruled out the need for compensation.\n\n60.\n\nFrom whatever angle, the Committee is of the opinion that there would not have been any reason, in the case at hand, to annul the Award for failure to state reasons in respect of the application of Article X(1).\n\n**B. The Non-Application of Articles II and IV of the Treaty: The Ground of Failure to State Reasons**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe DRC further argues, albeit less fierce fully and rather *ad abundatiorem cautelam*, that the Award suffers from a failure to state reasons as to qualifying the measures under dispute as expropriation, as the Arbitral Tribunal did not take into account Article II (\"Treatment of Investment\") and Article IV (\"Compensation for Damages due to War and Similar Events\") of the Treaty. It argues that the Arbitral Tribunal should have interpreted and applied Article III(1) in light of Articles II(4) and IV, which would have led it to conclude that there was no expropriation.\n\n62.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee sees no purpose being served by specifically examining these criticisms of the Award, all the more so since the provisions in question do not have the same likelihood of 'applicability' in the case at hand as does Article X(1). The Committee shall confine itself to stressing that the application of these provisions of the Treaty was not adduced before the Arbitral Tribunal; several of the considerations set forth above with regard to Article X could be transposed to the non-application of Articles II(4) and IV, and, in any event, the ground of failure to state reasons cannot be applied in the case of provisions not adduced before the tribunal ruling on merits.\n\n**IV. Failure to State Reasons with Regard to the Evaluation of the Compensation**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Arbitral Tribunal's Findings**\n---------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal calculated the damages sustained by Mr. Patrick Mitchell on the basis of Article III(1) of the Treaty, which stipulates that \"Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment.\" It examined Mr. Mitchell's various accounts in Congo, the United States, and South Africa, and found, on the one hand (para. 79), that:\n\n\"For reasons related to the monetary fluctuations in the DRC, most of the clients paid their fees in US$ to the accounts of Mitchell & Associates in the USA or in the RSA, whereas payments in cash were usual in the Congo.\"\n\nIt found, on the other hand (para. 80), that the payments to the accounts in the United States and South Africa:\n\n\"are related to services provided by the Claimant's firm in the DRC.\"\n\nFinally, the Arbitral Tribunal retained only the payments recorded on Mr. Mitchell's accounts in the United States (para. 87), clarifying that:\n\n\"The Tribunal finds that the variations and differences appearing when consulting these accounts [the accounts held at the Office in Kinshasa], as well as the small accounts on balance, do not justify taking them into account for the purpose of establishing the commercial value of the firm, the profit of which results essentially from the accounts held in the USA.\"\n\n**B. The DRC's criticism**\n--------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe DRC argues that the Award suffers from a failure to state reasons in various different ways, which are summarized as follows:\n\n(i) The Award uses as its basis for calculating the damage to Mr. Mitchell the projection into the future, over three years, of the income from the three preceding years, without providing clear explanations in this respect: If Mr. Mitchell's return to the DRC meant that the effects of the expropriation had come to an end, the measures taken against the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm would not have resulted in \"the total loss of the firm as an entity providing legal services in the DRC\" (para. 65 of the Award) and the loss of clients would not have been definitive (contrary to what is stated in para. 72 of the Award); there would thus be contradictory reasoning. If, on the other hand, the three-year period selected was not associated with the end of the effects of the expropriation upon Mr. Mitchell's return to Congo, that the reasoning behind the Award is incomplete and incomprehensible.\n\n(ii) The Arbitral Tribunal chose a method for valuation of compensation consisting in projecting past profits into the future, without taking account of political circumstances and of the state of war in Congo, which had profoundly disrupted the Congolese economy.\n\n(iii) The Arbitral Tribunal took into account the affidavit of SAKIMA SARL in order to conclude that the measures under dispute had resulted in the loss of clients by Mr. Mitchell, while the DRC had presented in its discussion of the facts that there were ties between that company and Mr. Patrick Mitchell (this would constitute not only a failure to state reasons, but also - according to an argument raised by Respondent three times, yet incidentally31 - a serious violation of a procedural rule).\n\n(iv) Once the Award accepted that all the services invoiced by Mr. Mitchell's offices in the United States and South Africa were performed in the DRC - thus limiting those offices to an invoicing function - it could not without contradicting itself take into account the expenses of those offices.\n\n(v) The Arbitral Tribunal does not explain why it calculated the amount of the compensation without taking into account the impact of the Congolese and/or U.S. tax systems.\n\n(vi) The Award took into account the full market value of the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm without inquiring into the share of each of the partners in that office.\n\nApplication for Annulment and Stay of Enforcement of the Award of February 9, 2004, dated June 7, 2004, \u00a7 40; Respondent's Reply to the Counter-Memorial of Mr. Mitchell of February 23, 2005, \u00a7 66; Transcript of the hearing of May 11, 2005, p. 17.\n\n**C. The** ***ad hoc*** **Committee's analysis**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThere is no question that all the criticisms formulated by the DRC pertain to questions on the merits. This said, Article 52(1)(e) may be applicable, even in respect of questions on the merits, when the reasoning of the Arbitral Tribunal is inadequate or contradictory. It must nevertheless be observed, first, that the reasoning of the Arbitral Tribunal as to the valuation of the compensation is lengthy and detailed, covering six pages of the Award, and it appears from its very wording that the parties had ample opportunity to express themselves on all the issues relating to that valuation. The Committee will examine the various points raised by the DRC in a summary manner, within the limits of a control of the coherence of the reasoning, and without expressing itself on any possible poor decision which it is not called upon to correct in any event.\n\n(i) As to the first point raised by the DRC, the Committee is of the opinion that, although Mr. Mitchell's return to the DRC was in fact mentioned, among other elements, in para. 93 of the Award, there does not appear to be any direct connection between that reference and the three-year duration selected by the Arbitral Tribunal; consequently, there is no reason to speak of contradictory reasoning. The use of the three-year period stems from the Arbitral Tribunal's assessment of the valuation made by Mr. Maritz, the certified public accountant presented by the Claimant and whose expertise was used as the basis for calculating compensation. This assessment is sovereign, and even though the Arbitral Tribunal does not fully explain itself on this point, the *ad hoc* Committee does not consider that its reasons can be characterized as incomplete or inconsistent.\n\n(ii) On the second point raised by the DRC, the Committee finds that the Tribunal's assessment was based, as above, on the expert opinion of Mr. Maritz, who used a conventional calculation method for determining the fair market value of an enterprise. The Arbitral Tribunal adopted a lower capitalization rate than the one adopted by the expert, duly taking into account \"the economic and political environment of the Congo.\" The existence of a failure to state reasons on this point cannot be supported.\n\n(iii) On the third point raised by the DRC, it appears from the wording of the Award (para. 64) that the Arbitral Tribunal ruled on the loss of clients of the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm on the basis of statements from various clients of that firm, and not solely on the affidavit from SAKIMA SARL. As the Tribunal is \"judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value\" (Rule 34(1) of the Arbitration Rules), in the case at hand there can neither be a failure to state reasons nor a serious violation of a rule of procedure. This is all the more true in that the Respondent failed to contest except quite indirectly the credibility of this witness, and is consequently not permitted to raise such an argument during the Annulment Proceeding.\n\n(iv) On the fourth point raised by the DRC, the inclusion in the compensation calculation of any particular expenditure may be freely determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. In the case at hand, the inclusion of a high amount of expenses for the U.S. and South Africa offices when they should have been limited to invoicing activities does not constitute contradictory reasoning, but a possible incorrect finding, which is outside the mission of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n(v) Everything stated with regard to the fourth point raised by the DRC stands as well for the fifth point, which refers to the non-consideration of the impact of the Congolese and/or U.S. tax systems in the calculation of compensation. Moreover, as this argument was raised by the DRC for the first time during the Annulment Proceeding, it is inadmissible.\n\n(vi) Finally, on the last point raised by the DRC, the question of the legal status of the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm was adduced before the Arbitral Tribunal in order to contest Claimant's standing, and not in the context of the calculation of compensation. While it is true that the Arbitral Tribunal might have briefly explained why its calculation of the compensation for the Claimant, an individual, is based on total revenue of the \"Mitchell & Associates\" firm, it can be discerned from the Award (paras. 23, 62 of the French version of the Award, especially) that it apparently considered Messrs. Djunga and Risasi as \"employees\" or \"collaborateurs\" of the firm and not as partners. This cannot be regarded as a failure to state reasons, especially since both parties in their pleadings used the terms \"employees\" and \"partners\" indiscriminately.\n\n66.\n\nIn conclusion, the Award is not tainted by a failure to state reasons as regards the valuation of the compensation; it therefore could not have been annulled for this reason on the basis of Article 52(1)(3).\n\n**V. Decision**\n---------------\n\n67.\n\nIn consideration of the foregoing, the *ad hoc* Committee unanimously decides to:\n\n\u25a0 Annul the Award of February 9, 2004 on the grounds of manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(b) and (e) of the Convention) owing to the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal to accept its jurisdiction on the basis of the existence of an investment within the meaning of the Washington Convention; such annulment applies necessarily to the Award in its entirety, pursuant to Article 52(3) of the Convention.\n\n\u25a0 Order the equal sharing of the costs of the Annulment Proceeding between the parties, with each bearing the expenses incurred for its own defense, including legal fees, which in this case, in consideration of all the circumstances of this Annulment Proceeding, appears to the *ad hoc* Committee to be fair and equitable. Consequently, since the DRC has solely been responsible for making the advance payments covering the costs of the Annulment Proceeding, amounting to USD 200,000, Claimant is ordered to pay the DRC the amount of USD 100,000."}]}
