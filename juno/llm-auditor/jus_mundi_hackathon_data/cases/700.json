Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe decision of the majority is based on the confidential shareholder agreements that the President obtained from the Claimant during the hearing. The significant provisions of these shareholder agreements appear in the quotations in paragraphs 319, 320 and 321 of the majority decision. Paragraph 319 refers to Article 2.02 of the Pooling Agreement that states 'in case the Shareholders are unable to reach a common position' then after consultations 'the shareholders shall thereafter act upon the recommendations of [the Claimant]'. Paragraph 320 refers to Article 1.07 of the same agreement that states ' [t]he Shareholders shall keep the terms and conditions of this Agreement strictly confidential...' Paragraph 321 refers to Article 9 of the addendum that states that the Claimant 'shall be the finance arranger for the Project and shall have the exclusive authority...'\n\nIf these are the significant sections of the secret shareholder agreement then my question is where is the breach of the Anti-Dummy Law, given the vast submission of documents in this arbitration, as part of the written evidence and after lengthy discovery battles? The majority of the arbitral tribunal understands that these contractual phrases constitute a violation of the Anti-Dummy Law. And even if they were, would these sections strip the Claimant's investment of all treaty protection? The majority thinks so, but I do not, particularly given that the shareholding of the Claimant in PIATCO and related companies was legal under Philippine law (as the majority accepts). After the Supreme Court of the Philippines has declared the Terminal 3 Concession null and void, and given the way the government and especially the Attorney-General have acted, is there any possibility at all of demonstrating a violation of the Anti-Dummy Law? I do not believe so. Firstly, PIATCO has not been a dummy. Secondly because the declaration by the Supreme Court that the Terminal 3 Concession is null and void takes effect *ex tune* and not *ex nunc,* so that the contract was never valid and had no effect. If this is the case, then PIATCO never held a public utility franchise and so the Anti-Dummy Law could not apply.\n\nThe majority also speaks of good faith in international arbitration. As I will explain, good faith applies to both the investor and the State Party.\n\n**B. The Philippines-Germany BIT**\n----------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThis is an arbitration pursuant to the *Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of the Philippines for the Promotion and the Reciprocal Protection of Investments* (hereafter ***\u00abthe Philippines-Germany BIT\u00bb*** or ***\u00abthe BIT\u00bb).*** Article 9 of the BIT provides for the Settlement of Disputes between a Contracting State and an Investor of another Contracting State. Article 9 provides that *\u00aball kinds of divergencies between a Contracting State and an investor of the other Contracting State concerning an investment))* shall first be addressed through negotiations, and if a settlement is not reached within six months, then the investor may submit the divergencies to arbitration pursuant to the *Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States,* of March 18, 1965 done in Washington D.C.\n\nThe Claimant has commenced this arbitration pursuant to Article 9 of the Philippines-Germany BIT in relation to its investment in an international passenger terminal of Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Terminal 3).\n\n3.\n\nOn July 12, 1997 PIATCO entered into a Concession Agreement with the Republic of the Philippines for the construction and operation of Terminal 3. Further negotiations culminated in the Amended and Restated Concession Agreement of November 1998 (the original Concession Agreements and its subsequent amendments are collectively referred to as the ***\u00abTerminal 3 Concession)}).*** Fraport became a shareholder in PIATCO and various related Philippine companies in July 1999, and increased its shareholdings in May 2000 and again in 2001. The result of these successive investments was that Fraport owned 30% of the shares of PIATCO and 40% of the shareholding of three related companies (namely, Philippine Airport and Ground Services, Inc. *(\u00abPAGS\u00bb),* PAGS Terminal Holdings, Inc. *(\u00abPTH\u00bb)* and PAGS Terminals, Inc. *(\u00abPTI\u00bb)).* The latest share purchase by Fraport occurred on September 5, 2001 with the purchase of 450,000 shares in PAGS for the amount of USD 14,700,000.\n\nBy 2002 the construction of Terminal 3 was virtually completed, and the Claimant and PIATCO wished to commence commercial operations. However, there was opposition to the Terminal 3 project within the Philippines which during 2002 reached the highest levels of government. These developments are fully described in section II.E of the Award.\n\nBy late 2002 the Respondent had decided that the Terminal 3 Concession granted to PIATCO was null and void. On November 29, 2002 the President of the Philippines declared publicly that *\u00ab[t]he Solicitor General and the Justice* *Department have determined that all five agreements covering the NAIA [i.e. Ninoy Aquino International Aiport] Terminal 3, most of which were contracted in the previous administration, are null and void\u00bb.* The President then said that the Terminal 3 Concession would henceforth not be honoured and declared: *\u00abI cannot honour contracts which the Executive Branch's legal offices have declared null and void\u00bb.*\n\n4.\n\nIn a decision dated May 5, 2003 in *Agan et al.* v. *PIATCO* (G.R. Nos 155001, 155547, and 155661) the Philippine Supreme Court found irregularities in the bidding and terms of the PIATCO Concession. The Supreme Court held:\n\n*\u00abWHEREFORE, The 1997 Concession Agreement, the Amended and Restated Concession Agreement and the Supplements thereto are set aside for being null and void. \u00bb*\n\nThe Supreme Court subsequently confirmed the finality of its decision on a motion for reconsideration. In December 2004 the Respondent sought and obtained a court order expropriating the Terminal 3 works. The same day the Respondent deployed 200 armed security personnel to take physical possession of Terminal 3.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant alleges numerous violations of the Philippines-Germany BIT arising from the annulment of the Terminal 3 Concession and the expropriation of Terminal 3. The Respondent alleges that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine this dispute because the Claimant does not have an investment within the meaning of the Philippines-Germany BIT.\n\nInvestment' is defined in Article 1 of the Philippines-Germany BIT as follows:\n\n*For the purpose of this Agreement:*\n\n*1. the term \u2019investment\u2019 shall mean any kind of asset accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State, and more particularly, though not exclusively:*\n\n*(a) movable and immovable property as well as other rights in rem, such as mortgages, liens, pledges, usufructs and similar rights;*\n\n*(b) shares of stocks and debentures of companies or interest in the property of such companies;*\n\n*(c) claims to money utilized for the purpose of creating an economic value or to any performance having an economic value;*\n\n*(d) intellectual property rights, in particular copyrights, patents, utility-model patents, registered designs, trademarks, trade-names, trade and business secrets, technical processes, know-how, and good will;*\n\n*(e) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources;*\n\n*any alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their classification as an investment. \u00bb*\n\n6.\n\nThe assets alleged by Fraport to constitute its investment within the meaning of the BIT (Claimant's Memorial, paragraphs 35-37; Award paragraphs 115-117) are:\n\n(i) Fraport's shareholding in PIATCO and in the cascade of Philippine companies (namely PAGS, PTH and PTI) that had direct or indirect shareholdings in PIATCO. The primary asset at issue in this arbitration therefore is the *shareholdings* in Philippine companies; and\n\n(ii) Loan and payment guarantees to PIATCO, the cascade companies, PIATCO lenders and constructors, and various expenses relating to the Terminal 3 Concession.\n\nThe Respondent states that Article 1(1) of the BIT contains a fundamental limitation in requiring an asset to be *((accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State\u00bb* which incorporates compliance with internal law as part of the international law standard that must be applied as part of the BIT's provisions. The Respondent argues that the Claimant breached Commonwealth Act No 108 entitled *An Act to Punish Acts of Evasion of the Laws on the Nationalization of Certain Rights, Franchises or Privileges* (hereafter the ***\u00abAnti-Dummy Law\u00bb)*** and for this reason its shareholdings fall outside the definition of 'investment' in Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\n7.\n\nArticle 1(1) must be interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:\n\n***\u00abArticle 31 General rule of interpretation***\n\n*1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n*2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:*\n\n*(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;*\n\n*(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.*\n\n*3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:*\n\n*(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;*\n\n*(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;*\n\n*(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.*\n\n*4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended. \u00bb*\n\nThe requirement that an investment be made in accordance with or in conformity with the laws of the Host State is a common provision in bilateral investment treaties. It has been considered, or at least referred to, in a number of awards (see, for example, *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A.* v. *Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction of July 23, 2001); *Saipem S.p.A. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7, Decision of March 21, 2007); *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L* v. *Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award of August 2, 2006); *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction of April 29, 2004)). The meaning of this requirement is a question of treaty interpretation, and not of precedent or analogy. The meaning must be determined in light of the terms, context, object and purpose of each bilateral investment treaty. The integrity of this interpretative process must not be compromised by the pronouncements of other arbitral tribunals in their interpretation of different treaties in wholly unrelated factual and legal contexts. Other awards or decisions are no more than illustrative of the implications of a standard form of treaty wording.\n\n8.\n\nThe object and purpose of the Philippines-Germany BIT is summarised in its title, namely, the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments. This object and purpose is confirmed by the preamble to the BIT, its content, and the second paragraph of the Instrument of Ratification of the Republic of the Philippines.\n\nThere are a number of other provisions within the context of Article 1 (as 'context' is defined in the Vienna Convention) including the following:\n\nArticle 2(1) of the BIT:\n\n***\u00abArticle 2 Promotion and Acceptance***\n\n*(1) Each Contracting State shall promote as far as possible investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting State and admit such investments in accordance with its Constitution, laws and regulations as referred to in Article 1 paragraph 1. Such investments shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment. \u00bb*\n\nArticle 11(5) of the Philippines-Germany BIT states that the attached Protocol forms an integral part of the BIT. Ad Article 2(a) and Ad Article 5(a) of the *Protocol* state:\n\n*\u00ab(2) Ad Article 2*\n\n*(a) As provided for in the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, foreign investors are not allowed to own land in the territory of the Republic of the Philippines. However, investors are allowed to own up to 40% of the equity of a company which can then acquire ownership of land.*\n\n*(5) Ad Article 5*\n\n*(a) With respect to the Republic of the Philippines it is understood that duly registered investments are assets of any kind as defined in Article 1, admitted in accordance with Article 2(1) and reported to competent governmental agencies at the time the investment was made. It is further understood, that the transfer guarantee is not limited to the capital values of the investments that have been duly registered. The Republic of the Philippines will relax as soon as possible existing reporting requirements. \u00bb*\n\nFinally, the third paragraph of the Instrument of Ratification states:\n\n*\u00abWHEREAS, the Agreement provides that the investment shall be in the areas allowed by and in accordance with the Constitutions, laws and regulations of each of the Contracting Parties;\u00bb*\n\n9.\n\nThese provisions demonstrate an intention to restrict the protection of the BIT to investments 'accepted' (Article 1(1)), 'admitted' (Article 2(1) and Ad Article 5(a)) or 'allowed' (Ad Article 2, and the Philippine Instrument of Ratification) in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting States, with Article 2 and the Philippine Instrument of Ratification adding express references to the Constitution of the Contracting Parties and Ad Article 2 referring specifically to 'the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines'. There is, in my view, no difference in meaning intended in the terms accepted', 'admitted' or 'allowed', and although Ad Article 5 suggests a form of admittance on registration regime for foreign investments, it was common ground between the Parties that no such regime applied to the Claimant's shareholdings in this case.\n\n10.\n\nAd Article 2 refers to a specific limitation in the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines on the ownership of land by foreign investors. Article iII of the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, entitled 'National Economy and Patrimony' defines in some detail the role of the State in the economy, including resources inalienably owned by the State, reserved privileges for Filipino citizens and restrictions on the participation in the Philippine economy by foreign investors. Sections 2, 10 and 11 of Article XII read as follows:\n\n***\u00abARTICLEXII NATIONAL ECONOMY AND PATRIMONY***\n\n*Section 2. All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, forests or timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, and other natural resources are owned by the State.* *With the exception of agricultural lands, all other natural resources shall not be alienated. The exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State. The State may directly undertake such activities, or it may enter into co-production, joint venture, or production-sharing agreements with Filipino citizens, or corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens. Such agreements may be for a period not exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for not more than twenty-five years, and under such terms and conditions as may be provided by law. In cases of water rights for irrigation, water supply, fisheries, or industrial uses other than the development of water power, beneficial use may be the measure and limit of the grant.*\n\n*The State shall protect the nation\u2019s marine wealth in its archipelagic waters, territorial sea, and exclusive economic zone, and reserve its use and enjoyment exclusively to Filipino citizens.*\n\n*The Congress may, by law, allow small-scale utilization of natural resources by Filipino citizens, as well as cooperative fish farming, with priority to subsistence fishermen and fishworkers in rivers, lakes, bays, and lagoons.*\n\n*The President may enter into agreements with foreign-owned corporations involving either technical or financial assistance for large-scale exploration, development, and utilization of minerals, petroleum, and other mineral oils according to the general terms and conditions provided by law, based on real contributions to the economic growth and general welfare of the country. In such* *agreements, the State shall promote the development and use of local scientific and technical resources.*\n\n*The President shall notify the Congress of every contract entered into in accordance with this provision, within thirty days from its execution.*\n\n*Section 10. The Congress shall, upon recommendation of the economic and planning agency, when the national interest dictates, reserve to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens, or such higher percentage as Congress may prescribe, certain areas of investments. The Congress shall enact measures that will encourage the formation and operation of enterprises whose capital is wholly owned by Filipinos.*\n\n*In the grant of rights, privileges, and concessions covering the national economy and patrimony, the State shall give preference to qualified Filipinos.*\n\n*The State shall regulate and exercise authority over foreign investments within its national jurisdiction and in accordance with its national goals and priorities.*\n\n*Section 11. No franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations organized under the laws of the Philippines, at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens, nor shall such franchise, certificate, or authorization be exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. Neither shall any such franchise or right be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires. The State shall encourage equity participation in public utilities by the general public. The participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any public utility enterprise shall be limited to their proportionate share in its capital, and all the executive and managing officers of such corporation or association must be citizens of the Philippines.*\n\nThese provisions of the Constitution prohibit ownership of natural resources, including land, by foreign investors; limit the participation of foreign investors in joint ventures relating to natural resources to no more than 40% of the capital (Section 2); prohibit the holding by foreign investors of any franchise for a public utility; and limit their participation in any Philippine corporation holding a public utility franchise to 40% of its capital, as well as limiting the participation of foreign investors in the management and governance of any public utility enterprise (Section 11).\n\nAd Article 2 of the BIT in making express reference to the limitation on the rights of foreign investors to own land in the Philippines reflects the terms of Article XII, Section 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines.\n\n11.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the Philippines-Germany BIT defines an investment as an 'asset', and makes express reference to 'shares' as a class of asset included in the protection of the BIT. The Claimant's claim in this arbitration is based primarily upon the treatment by the Respondent of its shareholdings in Philippine corporations. These shareholdings are an 'asset' and therefore an investment within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's shareholdings fall outside Article 1(1) because they were not accepted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Philippines in that the Claimant's investment breached the Anti-Dummy Law. I will deal with the Anti-Dummy Law later in this opinion. Assuming, however, that there were a breach of the Anti-Dummy Law, this would not deprive the Arbitral Tribunal of jurisdiction because the Claimant's shareholdings in a Philippine corporation are still a *\u00abkind of asset accepted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Philippines\u00bb.*\n\n12.\n\nIt is clear from the context of Article 1(1) that the word 'asset' is qualified by 'accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting States' because certain assets by law cannot be owned by foreign investors. In the case of the Philippines, a foreign investor that owned land, natural resources, a public utility franchise, or a shareholding in corporations exceeding the restrictions in the Constitution would possess an asset not accepted by law, and therefore would fall outside the protection of the BIT.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimant's shareholdings in PIATCO and the other Philippine corporations do not violate any Philippine law relating to the holding of this kind of asset. PIATCO was awarded a public utility franchise (namely the Terminal 3 Concession), but at all times at least sixty percent of PIATCO's capital was owned by Philippine citizens (including other Philippine corporations), and Fraport's direct and indirect shareholding in PIATCO complied at all times with Philippine law.\n\nThe fact that the Claimant's asset may have engaged in illegal conduct in the Philippines (allegedly, a breach of the Anti-Dummy Law) does not change the fact that its shareholdings are an asset accepted in accordance with Philippine law. The Respondent's interpretation of Article 1(1) does not respect its ordinary meaning, nor its context, nor the object and purpose of the BIT. The Respondent proposes, in effect, that any illegal conduct by an investor shall deprive the investor to the protection of the BIT. This is not what Article 1 states.\n\n14.\n\nOf course, any illegal behaviour by an investor is likely to have consequences. Criminal conduct can and should be punished within the domestic criminal justice system. Illegal conduct by the investor might well excuse or limit any liability of the State Party in an arbitration pursuant to the BIT, depending on the circumstances. It is also possible for the Contracting Parties to a BIT to exclude the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal for illegalities committed by the investor. Investor illegality is serious, and there are many means to address it. However, in my opinion, it is an artificial, decontextualised interpretation of Article 1(1) of the BIT that excludes the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal for an alleged breach of the Philippine Anti-Dummy Law, and an interpretation that does violence to the object and purpose of promoting and protecting investment in the Philippines.\n\n**C. The Anti-Dummy Law**\n-------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent submits, and the majority of this Arbitral Tribunal accepts, that the Claimant has breached Section 2-A of the Anti-Dummy Law. Section 2-A is not drafted for easy interpretation, consisting of a single complex sentence with three provisos. Comprehension is assisted by breaking the text up as follows:\n\n***((Section 2-A - Unlawful use, exploitation or enjoyment:***\n\n*Any person, corporation, or association which, having in its name or under its control, a right, franchise, privilege, property or business, the exercise or enjoyment of which is expressly reserved by the Constitution or the laws to citizens of the Philippines or of any other specific country, or to corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by such citizens,*\n\n*permits or allows the use, exploitation or enjoyment thereof by a person, corporation or association not possessing the requisites prescribed by the Constitution or the laws of the Philippines; or*\n\n*leases, or in any other way, transfers or conveys said right, franchise, privilege, property or business to a person, corporation or association not otherwise qualified under the Constitution, or the provisions of the existing laws; or*\n\n*in any manner permits or allows any person, not possessing the qualifications required by the Constitution, or existing laws to acquire, use, exploit or enjoy a right, franchise, privilege, property or business, the exercise and enjoyment of which are expressly reserved by the Constitution or existing laws to citizens of* *the Philippines or of any other specific country, to intervene in the management, operation, administration or control thereof, whether as an officer, employee or laborer therein with or without remuneration except technical personnel whose employment may be specifically authorized by the Secretary of Justice, and*\n\n*any person who knowingly aids, assists or abets in the planning consummation or perpetration of any of the acts herein above enumerated*\n\n*shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than five nor more than fifteen years and by a fine of not less than the value of the right, franchise or privilege enjoyed or acquired in violation of the provisions hereof but in no case less than five thousand pesos:*\n\n*Provided, however, That the president, managers or persons in charge of corporations, associations or partnerships violating the provisions of this section shall be criminally liable in lieu thereof:*\n\n*Provided, further, That any person, corporation or association shall, in addition to the penalty imposed therein, forfeit such right, franchise, privilege, and the property or business enjoyed or acquired in violation of the provisions of this Act:*\n\n*And provided, finally, That the election of aliens as members of the board of directors or governing body of corporations or associations engaging in partially nationalized activities shall be allowed in proportion to their allowable participation or share in the capital of such entities\u00bb.*\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant's actual shareholding in PIATCO never exceeded 30% of the total share capital. It also had an indirect shareholding in PIATCO through its shareholdings in PAGS, PTH and PTI. There is no doubt in this case that Fraport's direct and indirect shareholdings in PIATCO complied with Philippine law on foreign ownership (as accepted in the Award).\n\nThe treatment of indirect shareholdings in Philippine law is governed by the 'Control' test, which has replaced the earlier 'Grandfather' test and brings the Anti-Dummy Law into line with the definition of a 'Philippine national' in the Foreign Investments Act of 1991. The 'Control' test treats actual voting power as the decisive characteristic of a Philippine corporation, as it treats a corporation in fact 60% owned by Philippine citizens as entirely Philippine. The Control test is not, as the majority suggests (paragraph 352) 'a misleading rubric' but a rule of Philippine law, with the virtue of simplicity, that states there can be no violation of the Anti-Dummy Law on the grounds of illegal control where 60% of the capital of the alleged dummy is in the hands of Philippine citizens (other possible breaches of the Anti-Dummy Law, such as the violation of the provision relating to the election of aliens to the Board, are not of relevance here).\n\nNotwithstanding this clear rule of Philippine law, the majority accepts the Respondent's submission that the Anti-Dummy Law may still be violated by a foreign investor where 60% of actual voting control is in the hands of Philippine citizens.\n\nThe extensive analysis in the Award (paragraphs 357 to 382) devoted to the decision of the State Prosecutor, the official responsible in Philippine law for the prosecution of Anti-Dummy Law crimes, seeks to demonstrate that the reliance on this official on the 'Control' test and his failure to examine other forms of control is explained by the fact that the State Prosecutor did not have access to the secret shareholder agreements. In fact the State Prosecutor applied the Control test and no other because, as he explained, this is the law of the Philippines. The State Prosecutor considered and rejected the position, now adopted by the majority of this Tribunal, that control might be identified in 'organisational structure' as old law that *\u00abcan no longer be used in this case because the Foreign Investment Act already provided that the Control Test shall be used in determining the nationality of the corporation))* (Resolution of the State Prosecutor dated December 27, 2006 in the matter *of National Bureau of Investigation v. Cheng Yong & others,* I.S. Nv 2006-817, page 13).\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the *\u00abevidence shows that Fraport made a conscious decision before investing to evade nationality restrictions by use of contractual arrangements that it knew were not enforceable under local law)).* The Respondent identifies the breach of the Anti-Dummy Law in Fraport's contractual and financial relationships with the other shareholders in PIATCO, including the agreement of July 6, 1999 between four PIATCO shareholders (Fraport, PAGS, PTI and Paircargo) referred to as the 'Pooling Agreement' or the 'FAG-Paircargo-PAGS-PTI Shareholders' Agreement', and particularly Article 2.02 of this Pooling Agreement (set out in paragraph 319 of the Award).\n\nThe confidential nature of the Pooling Agreement and other agreements is presented as evidence of criminality. Reference is also made to subsequent legal advice, both from Fraport lawyers and from a consortium of lenders. The subsequent amendment of the shareholder agreements (including the removal of the allegedly illegal agreements in Article 2.02 of the Pooling Agreement, including the requirement that in certain circumstances the shareholders 'shall.... act upon the recommendations of FAG') is presented as evidence of the criminality of the previous agreements.\n\n18.\n\nThe purpose of the Anti-Dummy Law as its long title *('An Act to Punish Acts of Evasion of the Laws on the Nationalization of Certain Rights,* *Franchises and Privileges')* states, is to punish the evasion of Philippine nationalisation requirements, such as those in Article iII of the Constitution, through the use by foreigners of a Philippine entity that is a mere sham or 'dummy'. It is a criminal statute, and the offence created by Section 2-A is a serious felony punishable by imprisonment *\u00abfor not less than five not more than fifteen years\u00bb,* fines, forfeit of *\u00absuch right, franchise, privilege, and the property or business enjoyed or acquired in violation of the provisions of this Act\u00bb* and (in Section 3) dissolution of an offending corporate entity.\n\n19.\n\n***The Anti-Dummy Law criminalises the conduct of the dummy.***  Section 2-A creates an offence for a Philippine person or corporation in possession of a right, franchise, privilege, property or business expressed reserved by the Constitution or laws to citizens of the Philippines to allow itself to be used as a 'dummy' by foreigners in the ways particularised in Section 2-A. Section 2-A only indirectly provides for possible criminal liability by foreign investors in criminalising the conduct of a person who *\u00abknowingly aids, assists or abets in the planning consummation or perpetration of any of the acts herein above enumerated.\u00bb* However, the guilt of an accomplice depends upon the commission of an offence by the Philippine principal i.e. proof of *\u00abany of the acts herein above enumerated)).*\n\n20.\n\nThe Terminal 3 Concession was a public utility franchise. Pursuant to Article XII, Section 11 of the Philippine Constitution such a franchise could only be held by Philippine citizens or Philippine corporations *\u00abat least sixty percent of whose capital is owned by such citizens)).* The Terminal 3 Concession was granted to PIATCO, a Philippine corporation sixty percent owned by Philippine interests.\n\n***The Respondent has not demonstrated that PIATCO had violated the AntiDummy Law. If PIA TCO did not breach the Anti-Dummy Law, then Fraport cannot have aided, assisted or abetted or otherwise participated in any offence.***\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent's extensive submissions on Fraport's knowledge of the Anti-Dummy Law, its alleged criminal purpose, the secrecy of the shareholder agreements and the role that the Philippine shareholders allegedly conceded to Fraport ignore the *sine qua non* of its Anti-Dummy Law argument, namely, that PIATCO -the alleged dummy- has violated the Act.\n\nThe majority decision is based on the shareholder agreements between Fraport and the other PIATCO shareholders that allegedly gave Fraport illegal control of PIATCO. However, PIATCO was not itself a party to these agreements, and the Respondent did not demonstrate -and conceded it could not do so- that Fraport exercised any of its allegedly illegal powers of control or, more importantly, that PIATCO permitted and allowed Fraport to exploit or enjoy the Terminal 3 Concession by being used as a dummy.\n\nFor example, notwithstanding the emphasis given to Article 2.02 of the Pooling Agreement, and the massive discovery and disclosure of documents in this arbitration, there is no evidence that Fraport sought to exercise the powers in Article 2.02 on any occasion, or that the other shareholders accepted any purported exercise of this power, or any decision or action of PIATCO was in any manner influenced by the provisions of the Pooling Agreement. The Respondent conceded that Fraport never exercised these allegedly illegal powers (hearing transcript page 2528; Award paragraph 291). ***Accordingly, PIATCO never permitted itself to be used as a dummy and there was never any violation of the Anti-Dummy Law.***\n\n22.\n\nThe majority states that *\u00ab[i]t is clear from the texts of the ADL, as confirmed by the QT due diligence report, that it was* managerial *control which was the concern of the Constitution and the ADL\u00bb* (paragraph 352, emphasis original). 'Managerial control' is not an expression that appears in the AntiDummy Law. The Anti-Dummy Law does not criminalise Fraport for *possessing* 'managerial control' of PIATCO, rather it criminalises ***PIATCO*** if PIATCO has in any manner permitted or allowed Fraport *\u00abto acquire, use, exploit or enjoy a...franchise* ki.e. the Terminal 3 Concession]...to *intervene in the management, operation, administration or control thereof [i.e.* the Terminal 3 Concession], *whether as an officer, employee or laborer therein...\u00bb.*\n\nFor this reason, the mere execution of the Pooling Agreement cannot of itself be a violation of the Anti-Dummy Law.\n\n23.\n\n***The Respondent's submission, and regretfully, the decision of the majority, confuse a perceived recklessness by Fraport towards its obligations under Philippine law with the violation of a criminal statute.*** **I** do not share the interpretation of the documents that led the majority to the conclusion that Fraport *\u00abwas consistently aware that the way it was structuring its investment in the Philippines was in violation of the ADL and accordingly sought to keep those arrangements secret\u00bb* (Award, paragraph 332) but in any event this is a conclusion of no more than an illegal intent.\n\nFurther, the finding of criminal intent relies heavily on legal advice provided to the Claimant by its Philippine lawyers, Quisumbing Torres. This legal advice was obtained by the Respondent indirectly, and not through disclosure in the discovery process in the arbitration. When the subject of the legal advice is a serious criminal offence then the double violations of professional secret and the privilege against self-incrimination is problematic. It is particularly problematic when combined with the peculiar form of legal reasoning adopted by the majority (see, for example, Award paragraphs 323, 327, 329, 332, 355 and 356) that infers a crime from the Claimant's legal advice, rather than from a careful examination of its actions in light of the text of the Anti-Dummy Law.\n\nI also would not be prepared to construe a confidential clause in a shareholders agreement, such as Article 1.07 of the Pooling Agreement referred to in paragraph 320 of the Award, as evidence of criminal intent.\n\n24.\n\nAs a final point, the majority approach by equating the execution of shareholder agreements with an illegal managerial control, fixes the illegality at the moment the shareholders executed the agreements (i.e. July 1999). If the execution of the shareholders agreements was the commission of the offence, what then are the legal consequences of the repeal of certain provisions (such as Article 2.02 of the Pooling Agreement) of the shareholder agreements at the suggestion of the Senior Lenders in 2001? If the entry of the investment is the critical moment to determine legality (Award, paragraphs 315 and 395) in what way was Fraport's investment of a further jSD14,700,000 in PAGS in September 2001, after the amendment of the offending sections of the shareholder agreements, tainted with any illegality?\n\n25.\n\nThe Anti-Dummy Law also requires that the dummy ***in fact holds a public utility franchise.*** The dummy in this case is PIATCO, and the franchise is the Terminal 3 Concession. However, the Philippine Supreme Court in *Agan v. PIATCO,* on an application supported by the Respondent State, has found that the grant of the Terminal 3 Concession to PIATCO in 1997 was null and void. The Supreme Court denied reconsideration and the nullity of the Terminal 3 Concession is now *res judicata* in Philippine law.\n\nThe expropriation of the Terminal 3 Concession as a result of this Supreme Court decision is the basis of this arbitration.\n\nAs a matter of Philippine law, the Terminal 3 Concession was null and void when granted in 1997. Is it possible for PIATCO to be guilty of a criminal offence by acting as a dummy for Fraport to enjoy this franchise some time after Fraport first invested in this project in July 1999? This question has both a substantive and a procedural dimension.\n\n26.\n\nOn a substantive level, the Respondent has not demonstrated to the Tribunal that, as a matter of Philippine law, a corporation might breach the Anti-Dummy Law when the public utility franchise -a key element of the criminal offence- is null and void. As a matter of principle, in the interpretation of a criminal offence carrying penalties of up to fifteen years imprisonment, the subject matter of the offence should exist as a matter of law at the time the alleged offence was committed.\n\nThis Tribunal is bound to apply Philippine law to the interpretation of the AntiDummy Law (Article 42 of the Washington Convention), and it manifestly exceeds its powers if it does not do so. It is not bound by a decision of a Philippine court -even the Supreme Court- but its own judgment on Philippine law must be premised on Philippine law itself. It is *res judicata* in Philippine law that the Terminal 3 Concession is null and void *ex tune* and not *ex nunc,* and this must be accepted by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nIn my view, the Tribunal should respect the consequences of the Supreme Court decision. On this basis, it is impossible for PIATCO, or Fraport, to be guilty of any breach of the Anti-Dummy Law.\n\n27.\n\nAs a final point, I refer again to the decision of the Philippine State Prosecutor dated December 27, 2006 in respect of a complaint against PIATCO for a breach of the Anti Dummy Law (Resolution of the State Prosecutor dated December 27, 2006 in the matter of *National Bureau of Investigation* v. *Cheng Yong & others,* I.S. No 2006-817). The State Prosecutor is the official responsible in Philippine law to decide whether a prosecution should be made under the Anti-Dummy Law. In his lengthy and reasoned rejection of grounds for prosecution, the State Prosecutor stated (page 13):\n\n*((Finally, what the law prohibits is the granting of a franchise or the operation of a public utility by a corporation already in existence without the required proportion of Filipino capital as held by the Supreme Court in a long line of cases.*  ***Thus, if there is no grant of a franchise, as in this case where the government itself denies the existence of a public utility franchise in favor of PIATCO, then a non-holder of a franchise will result to the absurd and unfair situation where a non-holder like PIATCO is prosecuted for an offense which may only be committed by a holder of a franchise.***  *This could not have been the intention of the Anti-Dummy Law. We certainly cannot prosecute the individuals who clearly have not committed or could not possibly have committed the crimes penalized by the Anti-Dummy Law.\u00bb* (emphasis added)\n\n**D. Procedural Good Faith**\n----------------------------\n\n28.\n\nArticle 26 of the Vienna Convention provides:\n\n***\u00abPacta sunt servanda***  \n*Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith. \u00bb*\n\nThe Respondent must perform the Philippines-Germany BIT in good faith, and this includes its obligation under Article 9 to arbitrate its divergencies with a German investor such as Fraport. The principle of good faith in international law precedes and transcends Article 26 of the Vienna Convention. It extends, for example, to the abuse of rights, the improper use of internal law by State parties (a matter addressed in Article 27 of the Vienna Convention), and the principle that a State cannot adopt inconsistent positions in respect of the same state of facts (an application in the international sphere of the principle known in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions as estoppel).\n\n29.\n\nThe investor-State dispute resolution provision in Article 9 of the Philippines-Germany BIT constitutes an open offer of arbitration to the investors from the other State. The investor's acceptance of that offer, and so the formation of the arbitration agreement, does not arise until the investor commences arbitration *(**Lanco International, Inc.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6, Preliminary decision on jurisdiction of December 8, 1998)). The standing offer of the State parties must be made and maintained in good faith, and when accepted, the arbitration must be conducted in good faith.\n\nAs already noted, the requirement that an investment be made in accordance with or in conformity with the laws of the Host State is a common provision in bilateral investment treaties. At the same time, the abuse of its own law by State parties is a perennial problem in investment and international commercial arbitration. Indeed, the generic purpose of investment treaties of providing juridical security and certainty presupposes the need to control the Host State's use of its law for its own convenience. International investors and contractors have a long experience of the ingenuity of State parties in the use of their legislative, executive and judicial powers to escape their responsibilities, including their obligation to arbitrate. Investment arbitration requires a mutual respect for the law of the Host State, by both the investor and the Host State itself.\n\nThe misuse by the State party of its own law is the subject of the substantive provisions of bilateral investment treaties such as the requirements of fair and equitable treatment, and that there is no expropriation without compensation. It is also the subject of obligations of public international law such as denial of justice. However, the misuse of a State party of its own law can take procedural forms, and therefore effects the formation of the arbitration agreement and the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. In the context of an arbitration agreement arising from a bilateral investment treaty, such as Article 9 of the Philippines-Germany BIT, the formation and performance of the arbitration agreement is governed by good faith, derived from both Article 26 of the Vienna Convention and fundamental principles of procedure.\n\n30.\n\nThe epitome of the abuse of law is its inconsistency or arbitrariness. Where rules are applied to one person, and not to another, or at one time and not another, or at the discretion of one official or another, or recognised and enforced by one organ of the State and ignored by another, then there is an inconsistency contrary to the nature of law. As regards the formation of an arbitration agreement, the principle of good faith or estoppel prevents the State from taking a legal position that is inconsistent with its internal law, or the position it has previously taken with the investor regarding the proper application of its internal law.\n\n31.\n\nOn July 12, 1997 the Respondent granted the Terminal 3 Concession to PIATCO, and in December 2001 negotiations began between the Claimant and the Respondent to bring Terminal 3 into commercial operation. Over the next year, political opposition to the Terminal 3 Concession intensified. The following is a short summary of the position of the Respondent (or state organs for which the Respondent is responsible in international law) in relation to the validity of the Terminal 3 Concession from this point:\n\n(a) November 29, 2002: President of the Philippines publicly declares that the Solicitor General and Department of Justice have advised that the Terminal 3 Concession is null and void and will not be honoured by the government (Award, paragraphs 190-192);\n\n(b) May 5, 2003: Philippine Supreme Court sets aside the Terminal 3 Concession as being null and void (Award, paragraphs 207-218);\n\n(c) January 21, 2004: Philippine Supreme Court denies with finality motions for reconsideration of its May 5, 2003 decisions setting aside the PIATCO Concession as null and void;\n\n(d) September 17, 2003: The Claimant initiates this arbitration with its Request for Arbitration alleging that the nullification of the Terminal Concession amounts to an expropriation of Fraport's investment in PIATCO and related companies, unfair and inequitable treatment, and a denial of justice by the Philippine judicial system. In its Counter-Memorial dated December 20, 2004 the Respondent particularised many irregularities in the bidding and award process for the Terminal 3 Concession, and specifically defended the Supreme Court's decision to declare the Terminal 3 Concession null and void *ab initio* (Counter-Memorial paragraph 294);\n\n(e) December 21, 2004: Respondent files an *exparte* petition before the Regional Trial Court and obtains an *ex parte* Writ of Possession of Terminal 3 on the same date. Both the Respondent's petition and the decision of the Court refer to the Supreme Court decision declaring the Terminal 3 Concession null and void (Award, paragraphs 237 *et seq.);*\n\n(f) December 27, 2006: The State Prosecutor rejects the initiation of an Anti-Dummy Law Prosecution against PIATCO and its shareholders on various grounds, including the non-existence of a public utility franchise as required by the Anti-Dummy Law.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent has consistently taken the position that the Terminal 3 Concession was void *ab initio.* The Philippine President has publicly taken this position. The Supreme Court has confirmed this position. The State Prosecutor has acted on this position. The Supreme Court of the Philippines, the highest court in the country, has declared the Terminal 3 Concession void *ab initio* and confirmed the finality of this decision on a motion for reconsideration, so the question is *res judicata* as a matter of Philippine law.\n\nThe Respondent cannot in good faith take a position in this arbitration -namely that PIATCO held a valid public utility franchise- that is (i) contrary to its own internal lawm and (ii) contrary to the position its officials have consistently and publicly taken over a period of four years. Yet this is exactly the position that the Respondent has taken in pursuing the Anti-Dummy Law violation as an objection to jurisdiction. ***The Respondent is this arbitration escapes from its agreement to arbitrate by asserting the criminal control of a franchise that for four years it has insisted does not exist.***\n\nIn my view, this defence must be rejected on the grounds of procedural bad faith.\n\n33.\n\nThere is a further disturbing element to the Respondent's behaviour regarding the State Prosecutor's decision of December 27, 2006 not to prosecute PIATCO and its shareholders for violations of the Anti-Dummy Law. The Respondent: (i) misrepresented the content of this decision to the Arbitral Tribunal; (ii) misrepresented to the Arbitral Tribunal the material available to the Special Prosecutor when he made this decision; and (iii) publicly insinuated that the Special Prosecutor should change his decision because it might damage the State's position in this arbitration.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent's apparent attitude that its internal law may be manipulated for own convenience shows a disdain for the rule of law and is the epitome of bad faith.\n\nE. **Conclusions :**\n--------------------\n\n35.\n\nFor these reasons, I consider that this Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over this dispute, and in particular:\n\n1. The Claimant's shareholdings in Philippine companies constitute an 'investment' within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT;\n\n2. These shareholdings are a 'kind of asset accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of [the Philippines]', irrespective of whether the Claimant is guilty of any breach of the Philippine Anti-Dummy Law;\n\n3. The Respondent has not demonstrated that PIATCO as the public utility holder is guilty of any breach of the Anti-Dummy Law, and if PIATCO is not guilty of any breach then Fraport cannot be guilty as an accomplice;\n\n4. This Arbitral Tribunal must apply the current Philippine law relating to the Anti-Dummy Law. Philippine law applies the 'Control' Test to determine the legality of the shareholding of a foreign investor in a public utility franchise holder, and does not criminalise managerial control by the foreign investor. Fraport's shareholding at all times complied with the 'Control' test, and in any event it was conceded that Fraport never exercised any of the allegedly illegal powers under the shareholders agreements;\n\n5. As a matter of Philippine law, the Terminal 3 Concession was null and void *ab initio,* and therefore a violation by PIATCO or Fraport of the Anti-Dummy Law is legally impossible on the grounds of the non-existence of a public utility franchise;\n\n6. The Respondent's Anti-Dummy Law submission is premised on the validity of the public utility franchise, and therefore is an argument against its own internal law;\n\n7. The Respondent's Anti-Dummy Law submission violates the good faith required of a party in investment arbitration in (i) being contrary to its own law; (ii) being contrary to the consistent position of its senior officials in their dealings with the Claimant, with the public and in the exercise of their official duties; (iii) that the actions of its officials have been misrepresented to and manipulated before this Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nThe Respondent presented the 'secret shareholder agreements' as the 'smoking gun' of the ADL crime. There has certainly been plenty of smoke in this arbitration. However, if the actions of the Claimant, PIATCO and the Respondent, the terms of the ADL and Philippine law, are studied carefully, then the smoke disperses and reveals that there is no bullet, no victim and no crime.\n\n**F. Final Observations: Illegality and Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nAn investor that contravenes the law of the Host State of the investment must expect to suffer the consequences prescribed by law. Foreign investment occurs within a sophisticated legal framework of foreign ownership, tax, antitrust, administrative, labour, environmental and other regulations as well as the law relating to obligations arising directly from contractual relations. An investor that breaches any law or regulation bears the consequences, in the appropriate forum and in accordance with the applicable rules.\n\nThe principle of legality in investment arbitration, like the principles of *pacta sunt servanda* and good faith, applies equally to both Parties. Indeed, the very purpose of investment arbitration is to determine the legality of the conduct of the Host State and the investor under the applicable law.\n\nAs I have said, it is not uncommon for BITs to include in the definition of investment some reference to domestic law and regulation similar to the language of the Philippines-Germany BIT. The purpose of these provisions is not to condition the right to arbitrate on the minute compliance by the investor at all times and in all respects with the domestic law and regulation of the Host State. It was not the intention, for example, that a Host State might escape responsibility for unfair or expropriatory acts because the investor did not comply with domestic regulation relating to the expression of corporate names. Such an argument has been raised before an international arbitral tribunal and was properly rejected because *\u00abto exclude an investment on the basis of such minor errors would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Treaty\u00bb* see *Tokios Tokeles* v. *Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction of April 29, 2004, paragraphs 83-86.\n\n37.\n\nThe legality of the investment in investment arbitration has its analogy in international commercial arbitration in the validity of the contract. If the applicable law does not insist on the separability of the arbitration agreement from the main contract, then respondents quickly seek to subvert the arbitral process by challenging the validity of the main contract. Similarly, the phrase 'according to the laws and regulations of the Host State' might provide the Achilles Heel of investment arbitration if jurisdiction depends on the Claimant passing a full legal compliance audit.\n\nIf the legality of the Claimant's conduct is a jurisdictional issue, and the legality of the Respondent's conduct a merits issue, then the Respondent Host State is placed in a powerful position. In the Biblical phrase, the Tribunal must first examine the speck in the eye of the investor and defer, and maybe never address, a beam in the eye of the Host State. Such an approach does not respect fundamental principles of procedure.\n\n38.\n\nAs a matter of principle, therefore, the legality of the investor's conduct is a merits issue. The inquiry at the jurisdictional phase required by the phrase *\u00abin accordance with the laws and regulations of the Host State\u00bb* is limited to determining whether the type of asset is legal in domestic law. For the reasons already explained, I consider that the proper interpretation of Article 1(1) of the Philippines-Germany BIT in accordance with the principles of the Vienna Convention produces exactly this result.\n\n39.\n\nIt is important to emphasise that there is no question of an Arbitral Tribunal passing over or treating lightly any illegal conduct by the investor. The question is the proper time and context to consider and evaluate the proof and consequences of illegality. In many cases, legal action will also be possible in competent domestic tribunals. There is no question of impunity for the foreign investor. The foreign investor that commits a crime should go to jail or suffer the other penalties prescribed by law.\n\nHowever, it is equally mistaken to adopt an interpretation of a standard phrase in investment instruments in a manner capable of leaving an investor without a remedy, and a Host State secure and immune in a gross violation of a Bilateral Investment Treaty.\n\n40.\n\nI referred to the *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine* case as an example of a State's reliance on a trivial breach of local law to challenge the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. What of an example at the other extreme, of an investor that has engaged in systematic fraud or corruption? The recent award in *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award of August 2, 2006) involved systematic fraud in securing a contract with the Republic of El Salvador, for the operation of vehicle inspection stations, and the tribunal held that there was no jurisdiction on a number of grounds, including that the investment was not made in accordance with the laws of El Salvador.\n\nAs a matter of principle, even in such an extreme case the proper question is whether the kind of asset is legal under domestic law and, if so, the tribunal has jurisdiction and should move on to consider the merits. In a case of gross illegality the Host State will almost certainly have a defence on the merits, and the claim will be dismissed.\n\nIn cases of gross illegality there may also be other reasons for the inadmissibility of a claim. In some cases, for example, the principles of good faith and public policy may bar a claim. Both good faith and international public policy were important in *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador.* International public policy barred the claims in *World Duty Free v. The Republic of Kenya* (ICSID Case N ARB/00/07, Award of October 4, 2006). Alternatively, illegality might have consequences for jurisdiction peculiar to the circumstances of a particular dispute, as for example, where the illegality connects the dispute to events before the treaty entered into force, and therefore deprives the tribunal of jurisdiction *rationae temporis (**Empresas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Peru, S.A. v. Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, Award of February 7, 2005.)\n\nAs a final point, I refer to the practice of the casual use of citations from other awards without regard to their original contexts. Awards have been cited as if they were authorities or precedents on, for example, the significance of illegal conduct by the investor that bear no similarity to the case at issue. *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction of July 23, 2001) concerned the proper separation of contract from treaty claims. *Empresas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Peru, S.A. v. Republic of Peru,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, Award of February 7, 2005) concerned the date when a dispute had arisen, and the effect on this determination of certain decisions of the Peruvian courts, for the purposes of jurisdiction *rationae temporis* under the Chile-Peru BIT. *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L.* v. *Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award of August 2, 2006) is also not relevant to the arbitration before us, as it involved a concession solicited and obtained by fraud, where the documentary evidence of the fraud was overwhelming.\n\n41.\n\nFor these reasons, I consider that the decision of the majority in this arbitration is not only contrary to the terms of Article 1(1) of the Philippines-Germany BIT, but it is also fundamentally wrong in its approach to illegality as a matter of principle."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **GLOSSARY** |\n| **Abbreviation** | **Definition** |\n| ADB | Asian Development Bank |\n| ADL | Anti-Dummy Law |\n| AEDC | Asia's Emerging Dragon Corporation |\n| ARCA | Amended and Restated Concession Agreement |\n| \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\" | Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of the Philippines on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments |\n| Blue Ribbon Committee | Senate Committee on Accountability of Public Officers and Investigations |\n| BOT Law | Republic Act No. 7718 entitled \"An Act Authorizing the Financing, Construction, Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructure Projects by the Private Sector and for Other Purposes\" |\n| BSP | Bangko Sentral ng Philipinas |\n| Clark | Clark Field Airport |\n| DMIA | Diosdado Macapagal International Airport |\n| DOTC | The Philippine Department of Transportation and Communication |\n| Dresdner Bank | Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein |\n| EPC Contract | Agreement entered into by Takenaka, PIATCO, and Takenaka's wholly owned offshore procurement supplier, Asahikosan Corporation, for the construction of Terminal 3 |\n| FAG | Flughafen Frankfurt Main AG |\n| ICC | NEDA Investment Coordination Committee |\n| IFC | International Finance Corporation |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Abbreviation** | **Definition** |\n| IRR | Implementing Rules and Regulations of the BOi Law |\n| KfW | Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau MIA-NAIA |\n| MASO | Association of Service Operators Manila |\n| MIAA | International Airport Authority Ninoy Aquino |\n| NAIA | International Airport National Bureau of |\n| NBI | Investigation |\n| NEDA | Philippine National Economic Development Authority |\n| PAGS | Philippine Airport Y Ground Services, Inc. |\n| PAL | Philippine Airlines |\n| PBAC | Prequalification Bids and Awards Committee |\n| PEhA | Philippine Economic hone Authority |\n| PIATCO | Philippine International Air ierminals Co., Inc. |\n| QT | Quisumbing iorres |\n| SEC | Securities and Exchange Commission |\n| Security Bank | Security Bank Corporation |\n| \"TWG\" or \"ICC Contract Review Committee\" | ICC Xechnical Working Group |\n\n**I. PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\nA. **Overview**\n---------------\n\n1.\n\nAt the outset of its present Award, the Tribunal deems it necessary to set out certain facets of the dispute between the parties to this arbitration. This overview is meant to shed some light on the reasons why this arbitration has proceeded, in some respects, in a most unusual manner.\n\n2.\n\nThe investment at issue in this arbitration was made by the Claimant, a German company incorporated as Fraport AG Frankfurt Services Worldwide (\"Fraport\" or the \"Claimant\"), which has established itself as a leader in the international airport business. The Claimant's investment was made in a Philippine company, Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc., later known as PIATCO. Fraport's investment in PIATCO, both as a shareholder and lender, was influenced by the fact that the Respondent had, prior to the investment at issue, conferred upon PIATCO the concession rights for the construction and operation of a new international passenger airport terminal in Manila, otherwise known as \"Ninoy Aquino International Airport Passenger Terminal III\" or Terminal 3.\n\n3.\n\nPursuant to the ICSID arbitration provisions contained in the \"Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of the Philippines on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments\" dated 18 April 1997 and in force since 2 February 2000 (the \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\"), the Claimant initiated this arbitration on the basis of a number of allegations of breach by the Republic of the Philippines (the \"Republic\", the \"Philippines\", the \"Government\" or the \"Respondent\") of its obligations towards Fraport as an investor in the Philippines.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent, in turn, has challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in this regard and denies all liability under the Treaty. In the course of the proceeding, the Respondent has alleged that the Claimant made its investment in violation of the laws of the Philippines, in particular foreign ownership and control legislation known as the AntiDummy Law (the \"ADL\").\n\n5.\n\nIn the course of the proceeding, the Respondent has also made allegations of fraud and corruption on the part of PIATCO shareholders, including the Claimant, as well as on the part of various Philippine public officials. In connection with its allegations of fraud and corruption, the Respondent contends that relevant evidence can be found in documents and submissions filed in a related pending ICC arbitration initiated by PIATCO against the Respondent. The Respondent has further alleged that such evidence could be uncovered in the course of ongoing investigations in Germany, as well as in the Philippines, the united States and Hong Kong.\n\n**B. Registration of the Request for Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 17 September 2003, the Claimant filed its request for arbitration (the \"Request\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") against the Respondent for the resolution of divergencies having arisen amongst the parties to this arbitration. The Request was submitted in accordance with the ICSID arbitration provisions contained in the Treaty, in particular paragraph 2 of Article 9 of the BIT entitled \"Settlement of Disputes between a Contracting State and an Investor of another Contracting State\":\n\n\"If such divergencies cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article within six months from the date of request for settlement, the investor concerned may submit the dispute to: [...] (b) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes through conciliation or arbitration.\"\n\n7.\n\nOn 17 September 2003, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Institution Rules\"). On 23 September 2003, the Centre submitted a copy of the Request to the Republic of the Philippines and to its Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n8.\n\nOn 9 October 2003, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 6 of the ICSID Institution Rules, the Request was registered by the Centre. On the same day, ICSID's Acting Secretary-General, pursuant to Rule 7 of the ICSID Institution Rules, notified the parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to the constitution of the Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n**C. Constitution of the Tribunal and Commencement of the Proceeding**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nRegarding the constitution of the Tribunal in this arbitration, it was agreed by the parties that the Tribunal would consist of three members. It was further agreed that each party would appoint an arbitrator and that the third arbitrator, *i.e.* the President of the Tribunal, would be appointed by agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, by the Centre.\n\n10.\n\nOn 25 November 2003, as set forth at paragraph 90(a) of its Request, the Claimant confirmed its appointment of Dr. Bernardo M. Cremades, a national of Spain, as its party-appointed arbitrator. On 24 December 2003, the Respondent appointed Professor W. Michael Reisman, a national of the United States of America, as its party-appointed arbitrator. The parties subsequently agreed upon the appointment of Mr. L. Yves Fortier, a national of Canada, as President of the Tribunal. The President's appointment was confirmed on 11 February 2004.\n\n11.\n\nOn this same date, the Centre wrote to the parties confirming the constitution of the Tribunal and indicating that the proceeding was deemed to have commenced on 11 February 2004 pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID's Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"). The parties were further informed that Ms. Aurelia Antonietti, Counsel at ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. Over the course of the proceeding, Ms. Antonietti was replaced by Ms. Corinne Clave at ICSID, who in turn was replaced by Ms. Eloise Obadia, Senior Counsel at ICSID, on 31 January 2007.\n\n12.\n\nOn 28 January 2005, it was further agreed by the parties, following the suggestion of the Tribunal, that Ms. Renee Theriault of the law firm of Ogilvy Renault, an associate of the President of the Tribunal, would act as Assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n**D. Written and Oral Phases of the Proceeding**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 13(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and after consultation with the parties and the Centre, the Tribunal held its First Session in Washington, D.C. on 20 April 2004. During this First Session, the parties confirmed that they did not have any objections to the proper constitution of the Tribunal or to any member of the Tribunal. It was also agreed that the place of arbitration would be at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C.\n\n14.\n\nIn its first Procedural Order dated 23 April 2004, contained in the Minutes of the First Session, the Tribunal ordered that the Respondent file its objection to jurisdiction, if any, by no later than at the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of its CounterMemorial. In the event, the proceeding would be bifurcated, with the issue of jurisdiction and liability to be determined as part of the first phase and the issue of quantum, if required, as part of the second phase.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal also established a timetable for the written procedure on liability and objection(s) to jurisdiction, if any, as follows: the Claimant's Memorial by 10 August 2004; the Respondent's Counter-Memorial by 10 December 2004; the Claimant's Reply by 10 March 2005; the Respondent's Rejoinder by 10 June 2005; and in the event that the Respondent filed an objection to jurisdiction with its Counter-Memorial, the Claimant's Sur-Rejoinder was to be filed by 10 July 2005.\n\n16.\n\nDuring the First Session, it was also decided, provisionally, that pursuant to Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, a pre-hearing conference between the Tribunal and the parties would be held on 26 July 2005 in Washington, D.C. The oral phase of the proceeding with respect to jurisdiction, in the event of an objection thereto, and liability was scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C. from 29 August 2005 to 9 September 2005.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal was first informed of the related ICC arbitration initiated by PIATCO against the Respondent during the First Session. In that arbitration, PIATCO claims from the Respondent amounts allegedly owing pursuant to the concession agreements applicable to the construction and operation of Terminal 3.\n\n18.\n\nOn 1 July 2004, the Claimant formally submitted a request for the production by the Respondent of certain documents, including the submissions it made to PIATCO (and submissions and documents it would be making) in the related ICC arbitration. On 27 July 2004, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order addressing some of the issues raised by this request. On 3 August 2004, a further Procedural Order was issued regarding the parties' Confidentiality Agreement. Thereafter, on 10 August 2004, the Claimant submitted its Memorial.\n\n19.\n\nOn 18 October 2004, by Procedural Order, the Tribunal directed the Respondent to produce to the Claimant all of its submissions and documents in the related ICC arbitration proceedings on an \"on-going basis\". The Tribunal noted in its Procedural Order:\n\n\"While the present ICSID arbitration and the ICC arbitration are not strictly speaking, parallel arbitrations, the Tribunal accepts Claimant's representations that the underlying issues in both arbitration are, in substantial part, overlapping.\n\nIn the circumstances, there exists a real possibility that the two arbitral tribunals, presented with and asked to consider similar facts, could render conflicting or inconsistent decisions regarding those facts. This is not a desirable outcome.\"\n\n20.\n\nOn 24 November 2004, the Respondent sought an extension of the time for the filing of its Counter-Memorial. On 30 November 2004, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal indicating that the parties had agreed to an amended timetable, whereby the Respondent would file its Counter-Memorial by 20 December 2004; the Claimant would file its Reply by 8 April 2005; the Respondent would file its Rejoinder by 13 July 2005; and, in the event that the Respondent filed an objection to jurisdiction with its CounterMemorial, the Claimant would file its Sur-Rejoinder in this regard by 13 August 2005.\n\n21.\n\nOn 21 December 2004, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial, including its formal objections to jurisdiction. A corrected version of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial was submitted on 21 January 2005.\n\n22.\n\nAlso on 21 December 2004, the Respondent filed an expropriation complaint against PIATCO before the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City in the Philippines. By virtue of this complaint, the Respondent sought a writ of possession authorizing it to take immediate possession of the airport terminal at issue in this arbitration (the \"Philippine expropriation proceedings\"). The writ was issued and the Respondent was granted possession of the Terminal. To this date, the Respondent is the owner of the Terminal and has made a provisional payment to PIATCO representing the proffered value of the Terminal of approximately US$60 million, of which US$29 million was reportedly transferred to the Claimant1.\n\nThis matter is addressed in more detail in Chapter III of this Award (\"The Philippine Expropriation Proceedings\").\n\n23.\n\nOn 23 December 2004, following the expropriation, the Claimant submitted an application for interim measures for the preservation of its rights pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n24.\n\nOn 27 January 2005, the Tribunal convened an in-person meeting with the parties in Washington, D.C. to dispose of the Claimant's application for interim measures and, if any, all outstanding requests for document production on the part of both the Claimant and the Respondent. The Tribunal also requested a full status report from the parties with respect to the expropriation proceedings in the Philippines. During this meeting, the Claimant confirmed that its application for interim measures was withdrawn. The issue of document production was also extensively discussed, including whether the timetable for written pleadings ought to be modified in light of the parties' recent submissions and the document production process. The Tribunal decided, *inter alia,* that the timetable would remain unchanged. The Tribunal also confirmed that the oral phase of the proceeding would commence, as previously scheduled, on 29 August 2005, and that the pre-hearing conference would be held on 17 August 2005.\n\n25.\n\nIn the interim, the Tribunal issued a number of additional Procedural Orders: Procedural Order No. 6 on 15 February 2005 regarding the Respondent's requests for production of documents of 26 August 2004, 29 October 2004 and 11 November 2004; Procedural Order No. 7 on 31 March 2005 regarding the Claimant's request for an order compelling the Respondent to produce documents withheld on the basis of privilege; and Procedural Order No. 8 on 8 July 2005 regarding the Respondent's request for production of documents dated 14 June 2005. On various occasions, the Tribunal reminded the parties that their respective disclosure obligations were of a continuing nature.\n\n26.\n\nOn 8 April 2005, the Claimant filed its Reply. A corrected version of the Claimant's Reply was submitted on 27 April 2005.\n\n27.\n\nOn 8 July 2005, the Respondent filed a request seeking an order that the deadline for the filing of its Rejoinder due on 13 July 2005 be stayed or at a minimum extended by six months and that the Claimant's Sur-Rejoinder and the hearing on jurisdiction and liability be rescheduled accordingly. Citing \"exceptional circumstances\" in support of its request, the Respondent invoked the recent political crisis in the Philippines which had led to the resignation of important cabinet ministers and had prevented proper communication between the Respondent and its counsel in Washington. The Respondent also referred to the unavailability of one of its key witnesses, Secretary Gloria Tan Climaco, due to medical reasons. The Respondent also stressed that it had not received some of the documents which the Tribunal had ordered the Claimant to produce, or the documents which the ICC tribunal, in the related PIATCO arbitration, had ordered PIATCO to produce to the Philippines. Finally, as part of the Respondent's request, the Tribunal was appraised of the ongoing investigations involving Fraport in the Philippines, Germany and the United States. Such circumstances, the Respondent argued, impeded its ability to fully present its case.\n\n28.\n\nOn 11 July 2005, the Tribunal informed the parties that the deadline for the submission of the Respondent's Rejoinder was maintained. Accordingly, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on 13 July 2005, under protest and with the following reservation:\n\n\"The Republic submits this Rejoinder under substantial objection and reserving the right to submit additional evidence that is currently unavailable for reasons described in our 8 July 2005 letter to the Tribunal [...].\"\n\n29.\n\nOn 19 July 2005, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 9 addressing the Respondent's request for a postponement of the hearing on jurisdiction and liability. The Tribunal indicated that it was not minded at that time to reschedule the hearing but that it would only issue a final decision in this regard following a telephone meeting with the parties which it scheduled for 26 July 2005.\n\n30.\n\nOn 26 July 2005, the Tribunal held a telephone meeting with the parties.\n\n31.\n\nOn 3 August 2005, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 granting the Respondent's request for a postponement of the hearing on jurisdiction and liability. The Tribunal said, in part:\n\n\"3. Having considered the Parties' submissions and deliberated, the Tribunal has decided, with considerable reluctance, that Respondent's Request should be granted. The overriding circumstance which, in the final analysis, swayed the Tribunal is the situation which obtains today with respect to the many documents produced recently by Claimant to Respondent as well as those documents which will soon be produced by PIATCO to the Republic of the Philippines in a related ICC arbitration.\n\n4. The Tribunal accepts that all of these documents, once produced, will need to be examined and analyzed by Respondent and its experts. Claimant has asked that Respondent file a witness statement and/or expert statement with respect to such documents, in accordance with paragraph 7 of the April 23, 2004 Procedural Order. Respondent, for its part, has requested the opportunity to make a 'supplemental submission to the Tribunal' with respect to any new evidence which such documents may reveal, as well as the right to submit additional declarations from various witnesses.\n\n5. Last Friday 29 July 2005, Respondent filed yet another request regarding the production of documents by Claimant. On Sunday 31 July 2005, Claimant responded to this request by stating clearly that it 'has produced all of the documents that the Tribunal has ordered.'\n\n6. Claimant has also made a request for the production of documents by Respondent based on the witness statement of Edgar R. Navales, which was submitted with the Respondent's Rejoinder on 13 July 2005.\n\n7. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is concerned lest, if the hearing dates are maintained, both Parties may be prevented from fully presenting their case. The Tribunal is also concerned that, even if it issues, prior to 29 August 2005, orders and directions which dispose of all pending Applications and Requests, there be a serious risk that the evidentiary record will be incomplete and that the efficient conduct of the hearing would thus be impeded.\n\n8. In the opinion of the Tribunal, these circumstances are truly extraordinary and constitute valid reasons for the exercise by the Tribunal of its discretion to postpone the Hearing in accordance with the Tribunal's Order of April 23, 2004.\n\n9. The Tribunal has, of course, considered whether a postponement of the Hearing could cause irreparable prejudice to Claimant. The Tribunal has reached the conclusion that it would not.\n\n10. However, the Tribunal will maintain the dates of 29 (at 2 p.m.), 30 and, if necessary, 31 August for a hearing with the Parties. At this hearing, the Tribunal, after consultation with the Parties, will fix, peremptorily, dates in early 2006 for the hearing on jurisdiction and liability.\n\n11. At this hearing, the Tribunal will also hear the Parties' oral submissions on all other Requests and Applications which are presently pending. The Tribunal intends to issue rulings on all of these outstanding matters promptly thereafter. The Tribunal will also establish at that time a definitive procedural timetable and calendar for the efficient conduct of this arbitration.\n\n12. Before the end of this week, the Tribunal will distribute to the Parties a list of all pending requests and applications of which it remains seized and which will be on the Agenda of the hearing at the end of the month. In the meantime, the Parties are ordered to refrain from filing any further submissions with the Tribunal.\n\n13. In the present circumstances, the filing by Claimant of its Sur-Rejoinder which was due on 13 August is suspended. A new date for the filing of Claimant's Sur-Rejoinder will be fixed at the August hearing.\"\n\n32.\n\nA procedural hearing was accordingly held on 29 and 30 August 2005 in Washington, D.C., at the conclusion of which the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, as contained in the minutes of this hearing dated 1 September 2005. A schedule for the production of further documents was established. The Tribunal also decided that the Respondent would be allowed to file an additional submission by 17 October 2005 in order to address documents recently produced by the Claimant. Similarly, the Claimant was given the right to file a Sur-Rejoinder by 17 November 2005 in response thereto. The Tribunal also directed the parties to report to the Tribunal, on an ongoing basis, on the progress of discussions which they were having involving the sale of Fraport's equity and related interests in PIATCO to Manila Hotel Corporation as well as developments in the various related legal proceedings, particularly in the Philippines and in Germany, to which the Republic of the Philippines, PIATCO and/or Fraport were parties. Finally, it was decided that the hearing on jurisdiction and liability would be held in Washington, D.C. from 6 to 17 January 2006 and that a pre-hearing conference would be held in December 2005 between the President and the parties at a date to be fixed later after consultation with the parties.\n\n33.\n\nOn 12 October 2005, five days prior to the deadline set for its Supplemental Submission, the Respondent requested an extension of time until 20 January 2006, invoking in support of its request various alleged deficiencies in the Claimant's production of documents. As part of its request, the Respondent also asked that the Claimant's Sur-Rejoinder and the hearing on jurisdiction and liability be rescheduled accordingly. Two days later, on 14 October 2005, the Respondent also made an application to submit various additional witness statements.\n\n34.\n\nOn 14 October 2005, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 informing the parties that the Tribunal granted the Respondent a one-week extension for the filing of its Supplemental Submission, *i.e.* to 24 October 2005. The deadline for the filing of the Claimant's Sur-Rejoinder was accordingly also extended by one week, *i.e.* to 24 November 2005. All other dates set by the Tribunal during the August 2005 hearing were maintained.\n\n35.\n\nOn 17 October 2005, the Respondent submitted a request for reconsideration of the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 12.\n\n36.\n\nOn the same date, by way of Procedural Order No. 13, the parties were informed that the Respondent's application to submit additional witness statements by Messrs. Silverstone, Pringle and Pieth, as well as Secretary Gutierrez, was granted. Its request to submit statements by two other witnesses was denied.\n\n37.\n\nOn 19 October 2005, following instruction from the President, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the parties verbally that the Tribunal, having considered the parties' submissions, had decided, unanimously, that the Respondent's request for reconsideration of Procedural Order No. 12 was denied, without prejudice, and that a more detailed order would follow.\n\n38.\n\nOn 20 October 2005, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 14 setting forth detailed reasons for the dismissal of the Respondent's request for reconsideration of its Procedural Order No. 12. The Tribunal stated, in part, as follows:\n\n\"6. The Tribunal remains concerned with the non-production to the Respondent of the PIATCO documents in the ICC arbitration. The Tribunal recalls that in its Procedural Order No. 4 of October 18, 2004, it accepted that 'the underlying issues in both arbitrations are, in substantial part, overlapping' (at page 1). The Tribunal remains of that view.\n\n7. Regarding production by PIATCO to the Republic of the Philippines in the ICC arbitration, the Tribunal notes the statement by counsel for PIATCO that '[d]ocument production shall re-commence immediately and shall be completed by 9 December 2005 '.\n\n8. This is the principal reason why the Respondent's request for reconsideration is denied, but without prejudice. While the Tribunal will not be held hostage to the production of PIATCO documents in the ICC arbitration, it will nevertheless consider any further application which either Party may make as document production on the part of PIATCO proceeds.\" (emphasis in original)\n\n39.\n\nOn 24 October 2005, the Respondent filed its Supplemental Submission, and on 23 November 2005, the Claimant filed its Sur-Rejoinder.\n\n40.\n\nSubsequently, in the period prior to the hearing on jurisdiction and liability, the Tribunal was seized of numerous requests from both parties and issued a number of further Procedural Orders: Procedural Order No. 15 on 8 November 2005 rejecting the Claimant's request for an order compelling the Respondent to produce a document over which it had claimed privilege; and Procedural Order No. 16 on 9 December 2005 pursuant to which the Tribunal, *inter alia,* granted the Claimant's request for an order directing the Respondent not to share with the Special Prosecutor of the Office of the Ombudsman documents marked confidential, granted the Respondent's request for an order allowing the late submission of a witness submission from Mr. Mendoza, denied the Respondent's request for an order accepting an affidavit from Mr. Maurits Van Linder and directed the Respondent to provide to the Claimant copies of all of its submissions in the ICC arbitration.\n\n41.\n\nOn 15 December 2005, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference with the parties in Washington, D.C. During this conference, various directions were issued by the President with respect to the orderly conduct of the oral hearing in January 2006.\n\n42.\n\nOn 20 December 2005, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 17 pursuant to which the Tribunal directed the Respondent to produce immediately to the Claimant all of its submissions in the ICC arbitration that it had not previously provided. The Respondent was also allowed to submit written statements by Messrs. Barrenchea and De Ocampo, provided they were limited to rebutting issues raised in the Claimant's SurRejoinder, by no later than 30 December 2005. Oral testimony on the part of Mr. Barrenchea for the purpose of rebutting accusations made against Secretary Climaco, in the absence of exceptional circumstances justifying the introduction of such testimony, would not be allowed.\n\n43.\n\nOn 21 December 2005, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 18 granting the Respondent's request that Mr. Villaraza be permitted to testify at the hearing on jurisdiction and liability by videoconference.\n\n44.\n\nOn 22 December 2005, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 19 denying both the Claimant's request for production of counsel for the Respondent's communications with the German Prosecutor and the Respondent's request for an order regarding access to the German Prosecutor's documents.\n\n45.\n\nOn 27 December 2005, the Respondent made a further request for a postponement of the hearing on jurisdiction and liability scheduled to commence less than 10 days later or, alternatively, a stay of proceedings, pending the resolution of ongoing litigation in Germany relating to its access to the German Prosecutor's documents and the production by PIATCO of documents in the ICC arbitration.\n\n46.\n\nOn 29 December 2005, by Procedural Order No. 20, the Tribunal ruled that the Respondent's request for a postponement or a stay of the oral proceedings would be heard at the outset of the hearing on 6 January 2006. The Tribunal further ordered the parties to refrain, unless otherwise directed, from filing any further written submissions until the commencement of the hearing on jurisdiction and liability.\n\n47.\n\nOn 6 January 2006, prior to the commencement of the hearing and as previously ordered, the Tribunal heard the parties with respect to the Respondent's request for a postponement or a stay of proceedings and, at the conclusion of arguments, took the matter under advisement. The request was later denied by the Tribunal. In its Procedural Order No. 21 dated 6 January 2006, the Tribunal stated, in part, as follows:\n\n\"14. In support of its present Request for a Postponement, the Respondent avers that 'the record is incomplete without the relevant and material PIATCO documents that [...] [t]he ICC Tribunal has ordered PIATCO to produce [...] by January 12,2006'.\n\n15. The Tribunal notes that there has been an ongoing debate between PIATCO and the Republic of the Philippines before the ICC Tribunal in respect of the production by PIATCO of documents sought by the Respondent. This Tribunal cannot in any way influence the timely outcome of the document production process in the ICC arbitration. The Tribunal further notes that documents may soon be produced. If they are, the Respondent will have the opportunity of seeking permission from this Tribunal to produce any such document which it considers relevant and material. In any event, the Tribunal will not postpone the present hearing until a date uncertain in the future when documents, which may or may not be relevant, become available.\n\n16. The Respondent also invokes in support of its present Request for a Postponement that 'the record is incomplete without Fraport's relevant and material documents seized by the German Prosecutor'. The Claimant, exercising a procedural option granted to it under German law, has opposed access by the Respondent to these documents, and such access has been suspended pending a decision of a German court. The Tribunal notes that these documents consist of 'investigation files' and that according to the Respondent, '[i]n the near future, either the German court will rule that the documents will not be made available, or these documents will be forthcoming'. In answer to a question from a member of the Tribunal in this regard, the Respondent's counsel stated that she did not know when the German court was likely to rule on the Claimant's objection.\n\n17. The Tribunal believes that the record before it is sufficient to commence a hearing on jurisdiction and liability. It thus sees the situation which obtains today as altogether different from the situation which obtained in August 2005 when it issued Procedural Order No. 10. The Respondent's Request for a Postponement is accordingly denied.\n\n18. The Tribunal would caution the Parties that in its Procedural Order No. 19 dated 22 December 2005, after having noted the Respondent's allegations regarding the Claimant's alleged behaviour which forms part of the Request No. 2 (regarding access to the documents seized by the German Prosecutor), the Tribunal ruled that 'each Party will be at liberty during the merits hearing to invite the Tribunal to draw appropriate inferences from the other Party's failure to comply voluntarily with its Request'.\n\n19. Before concluding the present Order, the Tribunal wishes to remind the Parties of ICSID Arbitration Rule 38 (Closure of the Proceeding):\n\n(1) When the presentation of the case by the parties is completed, the proceeding shall be declared closed.\n\n(2) Exceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, reopen the proceeding on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points.'\n\n20. As mentioned by the Tribunal during oral arguments on 6 January 2006, in the event that there is an application to the Tribunal by either Party pursuant to a provision of the above-cited Rule, the Tribunal in exercising its discretion of necessity will be mindful of and take into account the totality of the record since it has been constituted.\"\n\n48.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction and liability was held in Washington, D.C. from 6 January to 17 January 2006, *i.e.* 11 hearing days. In addition to opening and closing arguments, the following witnesses were heard during the hearing:\n\nCalled for cross-examination by the Respondent:\n\nMr. Salih Samim Aydin\n\nMr. Dietrich F. Stiller Mr.\n\nManfred Scholch Mr.\n\nWilhelm Bender Mr.\n\nPeter Henkel Mr. Thomas W. Golden\n\nCalled for cross-examination by the Claimant:\n\nSecretary Gloria L. Tan Climaco\n\nMr. Reynaldo S. Libutan\n\nMr. Norbert Losch\n\nSecretary Maria Merceditas N. Gutierrez\n\nMr. Edgar Navales\n\nMr. Juan Jose Rodom T. Fetiza\n\nMr. F. Arthur L. Villaraza\n\nMr. Victor C. Fernandez\n\nSecretary Alberto G. Romulo\n\nSecretary Avelino X. Cruz, Jr.\n\n49.\n\nOn 1 March 2006, the parties, simultaneously, filed post-hearing briefs.\n\n50.\n\nAt this point, the parties' written submissions had totaled approximately 1300 pages, and their witness and expert statements had totaled collectively over 2300 pages, in addition to several hundred exhibits.\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that, at the request of the Respondent, in view of the ongoing related proceedings and investigations, the proceeding was not closed at the end of the January 2006 hearing on jurisdiction and liability. In fact, as will be seen later, after 17 January 2006, the Tribunal received numerous letters from the parties, as well as additional requests and applications.\n\n52.\n\nThus, on 10 May 2006, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal and made the following application:\n\n\"Fraport hereby requests that if Respondent is going to request leave to make any further submission to the Tribunal with respect to any new information currently in its possession, that Respondent be directed to so request the Tribunal by close of business on Friday, May 19. If the Tribunal grants the application, a suitable briefing schedule should be worked out.\"\n\n53.\n\nOn 19 May 2006, the Respondent responded to the Claimant's letter with the following application:\n\n\"For all of the foregoing reasons, the Respondent anticipates that it will request leave within the next two to four months to file an additional submission. Given the uncertainty in timing of the ongoing dispute over document production with PIATCO and the ongoing efforts in Germany, the Respondent submits that it is premature to require that a briefing schedule be established now, as Claimant contends. Instead, in the interest of efficiency, the Respondent requests that it be allowed to notify the Tribunal at the earliest time when a precise date can be set for the filing of an additional submission.\"\n\n54.\n\nOn 30 May 2006, the Claimant responded to the Respondent's application as follows:\n\n\"Having failed to request leave to make any further submission 4 months after obtaining the PIATCO documents, Respondent should be precluded from making any further submission based upon those documents. Further, Respondent should be ordered, again, to abide by the Tribunal's repeated orders that it provide Fraport on an ongoing basis all documents and submissions in the ICC arbitration. The Tribunal should accept the Respondent's communication to the German authorities as further unlawful treatment of Fraport and its executives in violation of the BIT. Respondent's baseless demands and threats for delay of the Tribunal's deliberation and issuance of an award on liability and jurisdiction in this bifurcated Arbitration should be rejected.\"\n\n55.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal seeking the following:\n\n\"The Republic will continue to update the Tribunal of any new significant developments in these matters. Beyond providing factual updates, it is critical that the Parties be allowed to brief the Tribunal on the legal implications of these developments. As such, the Republic requests that it should be permitted to address the legal implications of recent developments in the expropriation proceedings in a later written submission.\"\n\n56.\n\nOn 31 May 2006, the Respondent wrote a further letter to the Tribunal:\n\n\"Claimant has submitted a 14 page single-spaced letter addressing matters beyond those mentioned in our May 19 submission. Claimant's letter is effectively a supplemental submission on the merits that is calculated to impact the Tribunal's deliberations and should be disregarded.\n\nAlternatively, if the Tribunal plans to read and consider Claimant's submission, then the Republic must be permitted to respond before any consideration is given to the issues addressed therein. [...]\n\nAccordingly, we ask that the Republic be permitted to respond to Claimant's extensive and substantive May 30, 2006 submission, that came in the guise of a response to the Republic's discussion of a potential supplemental submission, before the Tribunal considers Claimant's submission. We are prepared to file a response by June 21, 2006. That response is not meant to supplant the requested supplemental submission based on PIATCO documents and any others obtained from Hong Kong or Germany in the interim.\"\n\n57.\n\nOn 6 June 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 22, ordering as follows:\n\n\"(i) the Respondent shall file an additional submission on 19 June 2006 for the purpose of addressing the Claimant's letter of 30 May 2006, the PIATCO documents, any other documents obtained from Hong Kong or Germany, as well as recent developments in the expropriation proceedings in the Philippines;\n\n(ii) the Claimant shall file its response thereto on 3 July 2006 m and\n\n(iii) the Respondent shall be entitled to submit a reply to the Claimant's response of 3 July 2006 on 10 July 2006.\" (emphasis in original)\n\nAs part of its Procedural Order No. 22, the Tribunal also reminded the Respondent of its directions that it provide to the Claimant on an ongoing basis all of its documents and other submissions in the related ICC arbitration.\n\n58.\n\nOn 14 June 2006, the Respondent sought a revision of the timetable established under Procedural Order No. 22. By letter dated 16 June 2006, the Tribunal informed the parties that this timetable was temporarily suspended pending the Claimant's response and the Respondent's reply.\n\n59.\n\nOn 23 June 2006, the Tribunal, after deliberating, issued Procedural Order No. 23, directing as follows:\n\n\"the Respondent shall file an additional submission on 15 August 2006 for the purpose of addressing the Claimant's letter of 30 May 2006, the PIATCO documents, any other documents obtained from Hong Kong or Germany, as well as recent developments in the expropriation proceedings in the Philippines;\n\nthe Claimant shall file its response thereto on 15 September 2006 : and\n\nthe Respondent shall be entitled to submit a reply to the Claimant's response of 15 September 2006 on 29 September 2006.\" (emphasis in original)\n\n60.\n\nOn 27 June 2006, the Claimant made an application requesting that the Tribunal reconsider its ruling under Procedural Order No. 23.\n\n61.\n\nOn 18 July 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 24 dismissing the Claimant's application requesting that the Tribunal reconsider its ruling under Procedural Order No. 23. As part of its Procedural Order No. 24, the Tribunal also stated:\n\n\"7. With respect to the production by Respondent to Claimant of all documents and submissions in the ICC arbitration between Respondent and PIATCO, Respondent is reminded yet again that it has been ordered to provide these documents to Claimant on an ongoing basis, i.e. as soon as they are available.\n\n8. With respect to documents which Respondent, or indeed Claimant, may receive from ongoing Hong Kong or German criminal investigation, both Parties are minded of their obligations to update the Tribunal and report any new development in a timely manner.\n\n9. Finally, with respect to the Philippine expropriation proceedings, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has offered to update the Tribunal (and Claimant) on all developments in these proceedings and it is so ordered.\" (emphasis in original)\n\n62.\n\nOn 15 August 2006, the Respondent filed its Additional Submission consisting of 80 pages, numerous exhibits and supplementary witness statements.\n\n63.\n\nOn 7 September 2006, the Respondent filed an additional submission.\n\n64.\n\nOn 15 September 2006, the Claimant filed its Observations to Respondent's Additional Submission consisting of 76 pages.\n\n65.\n\nOn 2 October 2006, the Respondent filed its Reply to Claimant's Observations consisting of 132 pages as well as further exhibits and witness statements.\n\n66.\n\nOn 25 October 2006, in accordance with Rule 38 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal stated:\n\n\"The Tribunal is of the view that the presentation of their case by both parties is now completed and the instant proceedings are hereby declared closed.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal's Procedural Order of 18 July 2006, as it pertains to the ongoing expropriation proceedings in the Philippines, remains in effect and Respondent is accordingly directed to keep the Tribunal (and Claimant) informed of the status of those proceedings.\"\n\n67.\n\nOn 5 January 2007, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Philippine Department of Justice had dismissed an ADL complaint made against PIATCO and Fraport officials (the \"ADL complaint\"2).\n\nThis matter is addressed in more detail in Chapter V of this Award (\"Analysis and Findings on jurisdiction\").\n\n68.\n\nOn 8 January 2007, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, taking issue with the Claimant's characterization of the Philippine Department of Justice's dismissal of the ADL complaint.\n\n69.\n\nOn 10 January 2007, at the Tribunal's request, the Claimant provided the Tribunal with certain documents forming part of the evidentiary record in the ADL complaint.\n\n70.\n\nOn 11 January 2007, the Respondent made further submissions to the Tribunal regarding the ADL complaint, alleging that although the ADL complaint was dismissed, certain \"critical documents\" had not been before the Department of Justice. The Respondent contended:\n\n\"These critical documents were unavailable to the DOX, not for lack of effort or interest, but (1) because of the confidentiality designation in this arbitration under the ordered confidentiality agreement; and (2) because Fraport, through German courts, blocked the Philippine DOX's request for mutual legal assistance in Germany. Having denied the Philippine DOX the crucial and relevant evidence, Fraport cannot celebrate the DOX's dismissal as evidence of its innocence.\"\n\n71.\n\nIn a letter dated 12 January 2007, the Claimant took issue with this contention of the Respondent. The Claimant reiterated that it did not have the full record regarding the ADL complaint.\n\n72.\n\nOn 14 February 2007, the Tribunal requested that the Respondent produce *in* *extenso* the documents having formed part of the record in the ADL complaint. The Tribunal added:\n\n\"The present request is not a decision by the Tribunal to reopen the proceeding under ICSID Arbitration Rule 38. The Tribunal merely seeks to complete the evidentiary record which the Parties have constituted with their attachments to Respondent's letter of 5 January and Claimant's letter of 10 January.\n\nUntil further notice, the Tribunal does not wish to receive any submissions with respect to this material from either Party.\"\n\n73.\n\nThe requested documents regarding the ADL complaint, consisting of over 1900 pages, were produced by the Respondent on 14 March 2007. The Respondent's document production regarding the ADL complaint was subsequently supplemented, *inter alia,* by additional documents provided by the Claimant on 26 March 2007.\n\n74.\n\nBy letter dated 13 June 2007, the proceeding was declared closed in its entirety. The Tribunal wrote:\n\n\"[T]he Tribunal is of the view that the presentation of their case by both parties is completed and accordingly, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38, the proceeding is now declared closed in its entirely.\"\n\n75.\n\nAs a final observation, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that the above account of the procedural history of this arbitration is not meant to be exhaustive. As noted earlier, this has been a bitterly fought case since the constitution of the Tribunal on 11 February 2004. The mere fact that, more than 14 months after the end of the oral hearing on jurisdiction and liability, the parties were still exchanging letters and submitting reports and documents to the Tribunal attests to the unusual nature of the present arbitration and explains why the Tribunal's decision has only been made now.\n\n76.\n\nThroughout this arbitral proceeding, the Tribunal has been required to address a plethora of procedural requests and applications, in addition to those reviewed in the present chapter of its Award. They were all extensively and diligently briefed by the parties, resulting in literally thousands of pages of submissions and exhibits. The Tribunal considers it unnecessary to describe these submissions beyond the account set forth above. The Tribunal wishes to acknowledge, however, the dedication and professionalism of counsel for both parties who, often in trying circumstances, have always sought to assist the Tribunal.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n77.\n\nFor reasons set out in more detail later in this Award, the Tribunal has decided that it does not have jurisdiction to rule on the Claimant's allegations of breaches by the Respondent of certain provisions of the BIT, because the Claimant's investment is not protected by the Treaty.\n\n78.\n\nIn order to fully understand the Tribunal's analysis and findings on jurisdiction, it is necessary to set out at some length the factual matrix of this case as disclosed by the evidence, written and oral, presented by the parties and thereby review the history of Fraport's investment in the Philippines Terminal 3 project. The Tribunal will now proceed to do so.\n\n**B. The Terminal 3 Project**\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. The Original Proposal**\n----------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe project to construct an international passenger terminal at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (\"NAIA\") in Manila, otherwise known as Terminal 3, dates back to 1990 when, as part of a report (\"Master Plan Review\") commissioned by the Philippine Department of Transportation and Communication (\"DOTC\"), it was recommended that NAIA continue to be the principal airport for Metro Manila, with construction of Terminal 2 for domestic passengers and Terminal 3 for international passengers.\n\n80.\n\nIn April 1993, the then-President of the Philippines, President Fidel V. Ramos, met with a group of six Philippine business leaders and asked them to submit a bid to develop Terminal 3. These business leaders, known collectively as the Six Taipans, were led by Lucio Tan, Chairman of Philippine Airlines (\"PAL\"), the national flag carrier; the other five were Alfonso T. Yuchengco, Henry Sy, Sr., George S.K. Ty, John Gokongwei and Andrew L. Gotianun.\n\n81.\n\nOn 15 September 1993, the Six Taipans incorporated a company known as Asia's Emerging Dragon Corporation (\"AEDC\") for the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining Terminal 3. Approximately one year later, on 5 October 1994, AEDC formally submitted its bid to the DOTC in the form of an unsolicited proposal for the construction and operation of Terminal 3.\n\n82.\n\nThe AEDC Terminal 3 proposal called for a US$369 million terminal that would be financed entirely by AEDC, *i.e.* at no cost to the Philippine Government. under the proposal, AEDC would construct a world-class passenger terminal with a design capacity of up to 10 million passengers annually. AEDC would operate and collect revenues from the terminal over a 25-year concession period, which could be renewed for an additional 25 years. During the construction and concession period, AEDC would also pay to thePhilippine Government a series of fixed annual guaranteed payments.\n\n83.\n\nIn the period during which AEDC was preparing its Terminal 3 proposal, the Philippine Congress passed Republic Act No. 7718 on 5 May 1994, entitled \"An Act Authorizing the Financing, Construction, Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructure Projects by the Private Sector and for Other Purposes\", better known as the Philippine \"BOT Law\". The BOT Law regulates, *inter alia,* project proposals that are not publicly solicited by the Philippine Government. under the BOT Law, the incentive for private investment is the concessionaire's ability to earn revenues from operation of the concession on agreed terms and conditions for a given period of time.\n\n84.\n\nThe BOT Law lists three conditions that must be met before a government agency or unit may accept an unsolicited proposal: (a) the project must involve a new concept or technology and/or is not part of the list of priority projects; (b) no direct government guarantee, subsidy or equity is to be required; and (c) the agency or unit concerned must have subsequently invited by publication, for three consecutive weeks, in a newspaper of general circulation, comparative or competitive proposals. In the event that another project proponent submits a lower price proposal, the original proponent has the right to match it within thirty working days. If the original project proponent matches the submitted lowest price within the specified period, it is immediately awarded the project; otherwise, the contract is awarded to the one tendering the lowest price.\n\n85.\n\nThe BOT Law and Implementing Rules and Regulations of the BOT Law (\"IRR\") provide the criteria for selecting the winning proposal: \"[T]he contract shall be awarded to the bidder who, having satisfied the minimum financial, technical, organizational and legal standards required by this Act, has submitted the lowest bid and most favourable terms for the project, based on the present value of its proposed tolls, fees, rentals and charges over a fixed term for the facility to be constructed, rehabilitated, operated and maintained according to the prescribed minimum design and performance standards, plans and specifications.\"\n\n86.\n\nThe BOT Law and the IRR further set forth various legal, credential, and financial requirements for project bidders. In the event of a public utility franchise, the proponent and facility operator must be Filipino or if a corporation, it must be duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and owned and controlled up to at least sixty percent (60%) by Filipinos, as further required by the Philippine Constitution. In addition, the project proponent, by itself or through the member-firms in case of a joint venture/consortium or through the contractor(s) engaged for the project, must have successfully undertaken a project similar or related to the project at issue.\n\n87.\n\nThe BOT Law also requires that an unsolicited proposal be approved by the Philippine National Economic Development Authority (\"NEDA\"). More particularly, pursuant to the IRR, the NEDA Investment Coordination Committee (\"ICC\") is tasked with leading the approval process in connection with projects \"involving substantial government undertakings\". As part of this process, the BOT contract is reviewed by the ICC Technical Board, and on a line-by-line basis by the ICC Technical Working Group (\"TWG\", or ICC Contract Review Committee), which recommends approval or disapproval to the ICC Cabinet Committee.\n\n88.\n\nIn the present case, the evidence discloses that AEDC's proposal for the Terminal 3 project, as submitted in October 1994, was endorsed six months later on 27 March 1995 by the DOTC Secretary to NEDA-ICC, as required by the BOT Law and applicable IRR. In May 1995, however, President Ramos publicly approved the simultaneous development of both Terminal 3 and a second airport which was known then as Clark Field Airport (\"Clark\"), a former United States Air Force Base. In light of this development, a revised proposal was forwarded by the DOTC to NEDA on 13 December 1995.\n\n89.\n\nThereafter, on 19 January 1996, as required by the BOT Law and IRR, the ICC Cabinet Committee reviewed and recommended approving the Terminal 3 project proposal upon the terms formulated by AEDC.\n\n90.\n\nOn 13 February 1996, the NEDA Board approved the Terminal 3 project in NEDA Board Resolution No. 2 along the terms and conditions imposed by the ICC, but added certain conditions concerning appraisal of the land valuation of the site and other clauses for negotiations. AEDC and the DOTC then held a \"Project Launching Ceremony\" for Terminal 3 in February 1996. The parties also signed a memorandum of agreement to fast-track the implementation of the Terminal 3 project.\n\n91.\n\nThe only challenge to AEDC's unsolicited proposal came on 20 September 1996 from Paircargo Y Associates, Inc. (which would later incorporate as Philippine International Air Terminals Co. or PIATCO). Paircargo Y Associates was a joint venture composed of People's Air Cargo Y Warehousing Co, Inc. (\"Paircargo\"), Philippine Airport Y Ground Services, Inc. (\"PAGS\"), and Security Bank Corporation (\"Security Bank\"). Paircargo operated a cargo warehouse facility at NAIA and was owned by Cheng Yong and his son, Jefferson Cheng (the \"Chengs\"). PAGS was a joint venture between Paircargo and GIobeGround, the latter a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lufthansa. Security Bank is a Philippine commercial bank.\n\n92.\n\nOn 20 September 1996, the Paircargo group thus submitted its proposal to the Prequalification Bids and Awards Committee (\"PBAC\"). On 23 September 1996, the PBAC opened an envelope containing the requalification documents of the Paircargo group. The next day, on 24 September 1996, the PBAC determined the Paircargo group to be financially capable under the BOT Law and the IRR.\n\n93.\n\nTwo days later, the PBAC's determination prompted AEDC to make its first official objection to the Paircargo group's bid, alleging that the Paircargo group did not have sufficient capital to meet the prequalification requirement. The basis for AEDC's challenge was the contention that the total net worth of Security Bank, one of the Paircargo group's consortium members, should not have been considered in evaluating whether the Paircargo group had the ability to raise 30% of the project cost equity. AEDC argued that the Philippine General Banking Act limited Security Bank's equity investment to no more than 15% of the total net worth of Security Bank, as opposed to its entire net worth.\n\n94.\n\nOn 2 October 1996, the PBAC rejected AEDC's challenge and informed AEDC that the Paircargo group had been correctly pre-qualified. The PBAC wrote: \"Based on the documents submitted and established criteria for prequalification the PBAC found that the challenger pre-qualified to undertake the NAIA 3 project.\" The PBAC further stated that the DOTC Secretary had approved the PBAC's findings.\n\n95.\n\nOn 16 October 1996, despite further objections raised by AEDC, the PBAC thus opened the Paircargo group's envelope containing its financial proposal. Subsequently, AEDC received a letter from the PBAC stating that it had accepted the Paircargo group's financial proposal, attaching Paircargo Y Associates' schedule of annual guaranteed payments to the Government during the construction and 25-year concession period. At this point, AEDC had 30 working days to match the proposal of the Paircargo group or the contract would be awarded to Paircargo Y Associates.\n\n96.\n\nOn 29 October 1996, AEDC's counsel asked the PBAC to provide it with official copies of the Paircargo group's financial proposal in order for AEDC to evaluate what it was being asked to match. The PBAC rejected AEDC's request. Consequently, on 2 December 1996, AEDC's lawyers, Villaraza Y Cruz, informed DOTC Secretary Lagdameo that AEDC could not make a decision on whether or not to match the competing bid due to a lack of sufficient data, which DOTC officials refused to provide. AEDC never submitted a bid to match the Paircargo group's bid and the latter was accordingly selected for the Terminal 3 project.\n\n97.\n\nSubsequently, on 16 April 1997, AEDC filed a civil suit in the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City against DOTC officials, PBAC Chairman Cal, Vice-Chairman Atayde, Technical Committee Chairman Alvarez, and PBAC voting members Ceser Valbuena, Herminia Castillo, and Wilfredo Trinidad. AEDC's petition requested a declaration that Paircargo Y Associates (which by then had incorporated as PIATCO) was not properly prequalified, a declaration of nullity of the award of contract to PIATCO, and an injunction against proceeding with its bid.\n\n**2. The Concession Agreement**\n-------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Concession Agreement was executed on 12 July 1997 by PIATCO (which had been incorporated on 27 February 1997) and DOTC Secretary Enrile, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines. Its core terms included the following:\n\n(i) The exclusivity for international passengers at Terminal 3, whereby the Government committed to relocate international passenger operations for Terminals 1 and 2 once Terminal 3 opened, with the result that the older terminals were to be used for domestic passengers and cargo. The development of Clark as a facility for international passengers was also restricted.\n\n(ii) Various concession fees and payments to the Government, as well as a distinction between \"public utility revenues\" and \"non-public utility revenues\".\n\n(iii) A concession period of 25 years, which could be extended by another 25 years at the Government's request. At the end of the concession period, PIATCO was to transfer Terminal 3 free of charge.\n\n(iv) The Government was given several options in the event of the concessionaire's default under the concessionaire's agreements with its lenders. Specifically, the Government had the option of allowing the concessionaire's creditors to be substituted, if qualified, as the concessionaire and operator of Terminal 3, or to designate an operator. In the event the Government were to designate an operator pursuant to this election, the Government would be obligated to assume attendant liabilities to the concessionaire's creditors.\n\n(v) A separability clause providing that \"[t]he invalidation of any of the terms, conditions, stipulations, covenants, conditions, or restrictions, or any part hereof by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction shall not affect the other provisions hereof.\n\n(vi) A conflict clause providing that, \"[i]n case of conflict between any of the provisions of this Agreement and any provision of any document or instrument relating to the Project (whether or not forming part of the Bid Documents), the provisions hereof shall prevail\".\n\n(vii) The Concession Agreement expressly permitted amendments, changes, modifications or supplements, provided that they were in writing and executed by both parties.\n\n99.\n\nSimultaneously with the signing of the Concession Agreement, a separate agreement (the \"Side Agreement\") was executed by the Parties to address the various possible outcomes following resolution of the ongoing legal challenge to the bid process raised by the AEDC lawsuit. If the AEDC challenge was resolved in favour of the PBAC *(i.e.* in favour of PIATCO), the Side Agreement would become void and of no effect. If, however, the challenge was successful and the Concession Agreement terminated as a consequence, the Side Agreement provided that PIATCO would be released unconditionally from any obligations under the Concession Agreement without liability and the Government would have to reimburse PIATCO fully for all its expenses.\n\n100.\n\nThe Concession Agreement, like all contracts in the Philippines for infrastructure and development projects, went through the process of being submitted by the DOTC to the ICC and NEDA \"for clearance on a no-objection basis, specifically on the extent of the final government undertaking to be provided to the project\". On 16 April 1997, the Concession Agreement negotiated between PIATCO and the PBAC members was thus sent to the ICC for approval. PIATCO's contract was required to meet the same conditions as AEDC's unsolicited proposal previously approved by NEDA in February 1996; any changes would require review and approval by the ICC and NEDA.\n\n101.\n\nOn 17 April 1997, the ICC Cabinet Committee held a meeting, the minutes of which reflect that an *ad referendum* was conducted. However, only four of the requisite six signatures were obtained to approve or clear the contract on a \"no objection\" basis as required by the IRR. The contract, therefore, was merely noted. The minutes at issue do not reflect that additional signatures were subsequently forwarded. In any event, on 9 July 1997, the DOTC issued a Notice of Award to PI ATCO, and the parties proceeded to execute the Concession Agreement on 12 July 1997.\n\n**3. The Amended and Restated Concession Agreement**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nBy 1998, the terms of the Concession Agreement were being renegotiated to allow PIATCO to obtain financing from certain international lenders. The loan PIATCO was depending upon had not materialized and the international lenders were requiring changes to the Concession Agreement prior to committing financing. The renegotiations to effect these changes culminated in the Amended and Restated Concession Agreement (\"ARCA\"), ultimately signed by PIATCO and Secretary Rivera of the DOTC on 26 November 1998.\n\n103.\n\nThe core terms of the ARCA included the following:\n\n(i) The concession payments, *i.e.* the basis thereof, would be established when operations were started by the MIAA. In addition, a passenger fee of US$20, as opposed to 500 pesos, would be collected.\n\n(ii) In the event of default by PIATCO, the lenders had the right to designate a qualified nominee to operate the Terminal or transfer the Terminal to a qualified transferee. If the lenders were unable to designate a nominee or transferee, the Terminal was to be transferred to the Government or its designee, with the Government being required to make a payment to PIATCO \"equal to the Appraised Value of the Development Facility or the sum of the Attendant Liabilities if greater\". The Concession Agreement had specified only that, in the event of a PIATCO default, the Government would have the option to take over the Terminal and to assume all attendant liabilities.\n\n(iii) If the ARCA was terminated because of a default by theGovernment, it was to pay liquidated damages to PIATCO.\n\n(iv) The ARCA added a special warranty as to the legality of the ARCA as well as of the actions of the DOTC and the MIAA in accordance with the contract to PIATCO. The Government further warranted that it was entitled to enter into the agreement and to guarantee that all of the procedures of the DOTC/MIAA in connection with the Terminal 3 project, including the order of award of the concession to PIATCO, were legal, valid and binding and in accordance with all applicable regulations.\n\n(v) The ARCA was to take precedence over the Bid Documents in the event of any conflict.\n\n104.\n\nThe same day that the ARCA was signed, DOTC Secretary Rivera forwarded it to NEDA. In his cover letter, Secretary Rivera informed the Director General of NEDA that the ARCA was the result of negotiations to address the concerns of international lenders. The cover letter also stated that although there were seventeen substantial changes:\n\n\"A great majority of the amendments, however, were for consistency of reference, adherence to defined terms, brevity, precision, and in some cases a mere matter of writing style. Rest assured that the so-called substantial changes do not contravene the minimum requirements of the Terms of Reference and do not put the government to a disadvantage.\"\n\n105.\n\nThe letter also attached a matrix prepared by PIATCO's counsel showing the section-by-section changes from the Concession Agreement to the ARCA, and the reasons for the change. After looking at the 135-page matrix comparing the changes from the Concession Agreement to the ARCA, Technical Board member Undersecretary of Finance for Corporate Affairs Lily Gruba suggested to the Technical Board that the ARCA be reviewed by the ICC Contract Review Committee, also known as the TWG.\n\n106.\n\nDuring this period, on 12 February 1999, President Estrada issued a Memorandum \"Affirming the Government's Commitment to Extend Full Assistance to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport [NAIA] Terminal 3 Project in order to Ensure its Completion and the Commencement of its Commercial Operations by 2001\". The memorandum, which President Estrada signed, was directed to the heads of 16 government agencies and \"all other pertinent Government Agencies and Officers\". President Estrada stated in the memorandum as follows:\n\n\"The Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) has committed to the fulfillment of all its obligations under the Concession Agreement dated 12 July 1997 (as amended and restated on November 26, 1998) with the Philippine International Air Terminals Co. In support of this commitment, you are hereby directed to engage your full cooperation in ensuring into completion of the said project within the timetable set.\"\n\n107.\n\nMeanwhile, the TWG, which was headed by Department of Finance Assistant Secretary Juan Jose Rodom T. Fetiza, proceeded with the ARCA review. Undersecretary Gruba assigned to him the task of reviewing the matrix of changes in the ARCA and preparing a memorandum for the Chairman of the Technical Board, NEDA Deputy Director-General Ruperto Alonzo. In a letter dated 12 March 1999 to Mr. Alonzo, Mr. Fetiza specifically summarized approximately eighty substantive changes in the ARCA that required further study and recommended that the ARCA be scrutinized by the TWG to determine its effect on the Terminal 3 project. At a meeting on 15 March 1999, the ICC Technical Board decided to refer the amendments to the TWG for further review.\n\n108.\n\nThe TWG met over the following months to review and resolve objections to the ARCA raised by Mr. Fetiza and others. When negotiations broke off, the ARCA was elevated to the ICC Cabinet Committee with a statement that most of the issues were resolved except for the direct guarantee language in ARCA section 4.04(c)(vi). On 25 June 1999, the ARCA was thus presented to the ICC Cabinet Committee and the only issue the Cabinet Committee discussed was the language in section 4.04(c)(vi).\n\n109.\n\nSection 4.04(c)(vi) of the ARCA addressed the Government's rights in the event of default on the part of PIATCO. It provided that in such circumstances, the lenders had the option to designate a qualified nominee to operate Terminal 3 or transfer it to a qualified transferee. Otherwise, Terminal 3 was to be transferred to the Government or its designee, with the Government being required to make a payment to PIATCO \"equal to the Appraised Value of the Development Facility or the sum of the Attendant Liabilities if greater.\" The Bangko Sentral ng Philipinas (\"BSP\"), *i.e.* the central bank of the Philippines, had viewed this as a \"buy out\" that would not be a direct guarantee provided it were optional, *i. e.* if the Government was not required to make a termination payment and that payment was limited to PIATCO's verifiable expenses, and not the amount of PIATCO's attendant liabilities to its creditors.\n\n110.\n\nThe ICC Cabinet Committee ultimately adopted BSP's view and conditioned its approval of the ARCA on BSP's review, approval, and monitoring of the credit agreement between PIATCO and the lenders to ensure the buy-out was optional and the termination payment limited. The ICC's conditional approval was accordingly contained in NEDA Board's Resolution that approved the ARCA, subject to \"the understanding that the credit agreement between the concessionaire and the Senior Lenders shall be subject to the approval and monitoring by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\". In this regard, the Tribunal further notes that Annex A of the ARCA (the required certificate from the Department of Finance) and Annex B (the required opinion from the Minister of Justice) both required a sovereign guarantee, but were never attached nor is there evidence that they were ever executed.\n\n**4. The ARCA Supplements**\n---------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThree supplements to the ARCA were also executed. The First Supplement, executed on 27 August 1999, addressed the Government's obligation under the Concession Agreement to deliver clean possession of the project site to PIATCO so that construction could proceed as scheduled. The ARCA had mandated that this obligation be performed by 30 September 1998, but the Government requested an extension of time. Pursuant to the First Supplement to the ARCA, the date for delivery of clean possession of the project site was accordingly extended to 31 December 1998, with corresponding changes to the rest of the contractual timetable. The First Supplement also made express that PIATCO would have responsibility to construct a surface access road rather than an access tunnel because a tunnel was deemed neither economically viable nor technically feasible. Finally, the First Supplement also amended provisions of the ARCA defining \"Revenues\" or \"Gross Revenues\", as well as provisions regarding \"Terminal Fees\".\n\n112.\n\nThe parties executed a Second Supplement to the ARCA on 4 September 2000, by virtue of which PIATCO agreed to take on the clearing of the site of subterranean structures. The Second Supplement also contained detailed provisions for determining compensation for PIATCO's performance of this task.\n\n113.\n\nFinally, the Third Supplement, executed on 22 June 2001, dealt with the surface access road between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, and imposed on PIATCO the additional obligation to build and finance the road. Four months later, on 16 October 2001, the Third Supplement was presented to the ICC Technical Board for approval. Submission of the Third Supplement raised questions at the ICC about the prior supplements that had not been approved, but which were submitted about ten days later. The ICC ultimately decided to defer discussing the Third Supplement until DOTC and MIAA explained why they executed three Supplements to the ARCA \"neither with justification nor prior ICC approval\".\n\n114.\n\nThe parties subsequently negotiated two additional supplements, *i.e.* the Fourth Supplement in 2001 and the Fifth Supplement in 2002. Neither one of these supplements was ever executed. The Tribunal will revert later in the present Award to these two Supplements.\n\n**C. Fraport's Investment In The Terminal 3 Project**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nAs indicated earlier, Fraport is a leading company in the international airport business and owns and operates the Frankfurt Airport, one of the busiest and most successful in the world. Fraport is also the owner, operator or shareholder, either directly or through affiliated companies, of a number of other airport facilities, both in Germany and elsewhere.\n\n116.\n\nFraport's investment as a financial participant in the Terminal 3 project spans a period of several years, starting in 1999 and ending in 2002-2003, when, as the evidence discloses, Fraport progressively wrote off its investment. Fraport's investment was both directly in PIATCO and, indirectly, in a \"cascade\" of Philippine companies that have ownership interests in PIATCO. In addition to its equity investments, Fraport has extended loans and loan and payment guarantees to PIATCO, the cascade companies and PIATCO's lenders and contractors.\n\n117.\n\nFraport directly and indirectly owns 61.44% of PIATCO. Its ownership of PIATCO and the cascade companies is set forth on the following chart submitted in evidence. As will be seen, the PIATCO shareholders, beside Fraport, are Jefferson G. Cheng, Paircargo, PAGS, and PTI, all of which are controlled by the Cheng family, as well as Sojitz and SB Airport.\n\n**1. The Initial 1999 Investments**\n-----------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nIn mid-1998, Stephan M. Bauchspiess, a member of PIATCO's Board of Directors who was also a manager of GlobeGround, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lufthansa, and the managing director of PAGS, a joint venture between the Cheng family and GlobeGround, approached Fraport on behalf of PIATCO and invited Fraport to join the Terminal 3 project as a consultant. Fraport, then known as Flughafen Frankfurt Main AG (\"FAG\"), agreed to become involved in the Terminal 3 project in that capacity.\n\n119.\n\nA short time thereafter, Fraport contemplated initial equity and loan infusions into PIATCO and affiliated companies. To this end, a Philippine KPMG affiliate, Laya Mananghaya Y Co., conducted a financial due diligence review of the proposed investment. In addition, Quisumbing Torres (sometimes referred to as \"QT\"), a local Philippine affiliate of Baker Y McKenzie, conducted a legal due diligence and issued to Fraport a preliminary report on 28 December 1998.\n\n120.\n\nThis report which, as will be seen later, addressed important provisions of the Philippine Constitution and other pertinent legislation, indicated, *inter alia:* (1) the need to consider carefully any shareholder arrangement other than an equity investment in PIATCO, in view of the Philippine constitutional requirement that foreign nationals can own no more than 40% of the capital of a public utility, and the prohibitions of the ADL that prevent foreign nationals from intervening in the management, operation, administration or control of a company that is a public utility; (2) the need to obtain ICC/NEDA approval for the ARCAm and (3) the need to obtain from the President of the Philippines a certification attesting to the authority of the government signatories to sign on behalf of the Philippines, because the BOT Law does not contain an express delegation of authority from the President of the Philippines as required by the Administrative Code.\n\n121.\n\nFraport was also advised to seek termination or resolution of the AEDC lawsuit (raising the issue whether PIATCO had been prequalified properly as a bidder) because \"court cases involving high profile infrastructure projects for policy reasons can be politically sensitive\".\n\n122.\n\nAn event worthy of note, in this regard, which occurred prior to Fraport's Supervisory Board's consideration of the PIATCO investment, is AEDC's dismissal of its court challenge to the award of the Terminal 3 concession to PIATCO. In fact, approximately six months earlier, on 14 September 1998, AEDC had withdrawn its pending challenge to the award of the concession to PIATCO (including its contention that PIATCO was not properly prequalified) at the express request of then-President Estrada, who had summoned AEDC to meet with him and his Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora shortly after taking office. The record discloses however that AEDC withdrew its challenge with continued misgivings, which AEDC expressed to President Estrada, as to PIATCO's ability to meet minimum equity requirements and to finance the bid.\n\n123.\n\nDuring the month of March 1999, Fraport's Supervisory Board ultimately determined that the investment would be made. The discussions leading to the decision to invest were recorded in the minutes of the Supervisory Board meeting of 12 March 1999. While the views of those involved in making the decision to invest will be considered in more detail later in this Award, the following excerpts from the meeting of 12 March 1999 are reproduced here:\n\n\" Mr. Schmidt reports that the information given [to] the employees' representatives is contradictory, so that it is difficult for him to make a decision. Moreover, the facts certified by the auditor are now being portrayed as no longer relevant. In order to take the decision requested in the submission, he needs reliable information that he does not possess today. Dr. Bender points out that it is very difficult for FAG to get projects if the discussion is conducted in this manner. He reminds of the joint statement according to which this company needs outside growth. During the latest strategy retreat, it was stated that FAG, over the next several years, has a strategic revenue gap of about DM 3 billion. This revenue cannot be achieved through increased activity in the Frankfurt market - even if the EWP already provides for an increase from DM 2.5 billion to DM 3.5 billion DM next year - but must be achieved outside. True, in part the Manila project is considered to be very risky, but FAG was asked to participate in it by a German company - GlobeGround. Even though the returns of this project are already taking *[sic]* into account the country risks, they are still far above the margin jointly agreed upon as any project's minimum return. He points out that it will be difficult to present again a similar project having this kind of returns and this degree of maturity.\n\n[...] Mr. Struck reports that on February 12, 1999 the President of the Philippines instructed all government agencies to proceed immediately with the construction of Terminal 3 at the Manila airport as THE international airport of the Philippines. This decree had not yet been taken into account by the K.PMG report. Now, the risk of the airport being built anywhere else must be assessed more cautiously. Also, the support of PIATCO as the airport operator is now certain. As to the question of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board which would be the consequences of a failure to reach a decision today, Mr. Struck explains that the equity contributed by PIATCO is nearly exhausted. Without the professional leadership of FAG, none of the current shareholders is willing to invest more funds into the project. Furthermore, the banks have asked PIATCO to make room for a competent airport operator; only then can the lending be finalized.\" (emphasis in original)\n\n124.\n\nThe Supervisory Board thus decided to invest in PIATCO in part in reliance on the representation that the Government had removed the risk of another international airport and supported the Terminal 3 project, and based on the conclusion that the failure to participate financially at this time would mean the loss of the project as an investment opportunity. Fraport's Supervisory Board made this decision with the knowledge that PIATCO had virtually no capital (\"the equity contributed by PIATCO is nearly exhausted\") and that PIATCO's shareholders were not willing to support the project without Fraport's commitment to provide equity and financing. It is in this context that Fraport entered into four agreements dated 6 July 1999 (the \"1999 Share Purchase Agreements and Share Subscription Agreements\"), whereby it acquired a direct and indirect interest in PIATCO as follows: 25% of PIATCO, 40% of PTI and 40% of PTH; PTI further acquired 11% of PIATCO.\n\n125.\n\nIt was also during this period that Fraport entered into shareholder agreements which, on their own terms, were to remain confidential (the \"secret shareholder agreements\"). While these secret shareholder agreements are reviewed in more detail later in this Award as part of the Tribunal's analysis and findings on jurisdiction, the Tribunal notes at this juncture that these agreements consist of critical evidence establishing that Fraport sought to exercise managerial control over PIATCO and thereby knowingly orchestrated its investment in flagrant violation of the ADL.\n\n**2. The Subsequent 2000 - 2001 Investments**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nIn early 2000, PIATCO, with substantial assistance from Fraport, concluded a competitive bidding process and selected the Takenaka Corporation as the contractor for the Terminal 3 project. Takenaka, PIATCO, and Takenaka's wholly owned offshore procurement supplier, Asahikosan Corporation, entered into several contracts that collectively are referred to as the \"EPC Contract\". The EPC Contract effectively transferred to Takenaka PIATCO's design, construction, supply, commissioning, defects liability and related obligations under the concession arrangements.\n\n127.\n\nConstruction commenced under the EPC Contract on 15 June 2000 to be completed in 30 months in late 2002. Regular meetings with the MIAA were held throughout construction to ensure that the MIAA was fully informed and that construction-related issues were properly addressed, including security, design, subterranean structure demolition, and utilities issues.\n\n128.\n\nPayments under the EPC Contract were to be made from proceeds from long-term finance agreements. In order to facilitate timely commencement of the work, the EPC contractors and PIATCO agreed to an interim works procedure whereby they could suspend work if their entitlement to payments exceeded or was likely to exceed US$70 million. In this connection, Fraport entered into several contracts that effectively made Fraport the guarantor of up to US$127.4 million of PIATCO's payment obligations to Takenaka and Asahikosan. In addition, Fraport supported as guarantor a term loan facility made available to PIATCO by a group of German banks. This term loan facility was eventually increased to US$165 million, US$138.5 million of which were available to PIATCO for utilizations. This available amount was fully drawn by PIATCO, in large part to make payments to the general contractor, 52.4% of which payments were deducted from Fraport's maximum liability under the US$127.4 million guarantee until Fraport's guarantee was reduced to US$86.7 million.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that at the time when it began contemplating further investments, Fraport had anticipated raising equity from PIATCO's other minority investors. To that end, in September 2000, Fraport had dispatched its financial adviser, Dr. Georg Braune of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein (\"Dresdner Bank\"), to the Philippines to \"win[] the additional support needed from the shareholders\". PIATCO's other shareholders, however, were unable or unwilling to invest additional money into the Terminal 3 project. Nissho Iwai, for instance, was still reeling from the effects of the Asian financial crisis, and thus declined to make its equity call. Paircargo, too, was \"unable even to make its basic contribution\". Like PIATCO's other shareholders, SB Airports also refused to make its required equity contributions, noting that \"its funds are currently tied-up in different projects\".\n\n130.\n\nIn short, Fraport was the only shareholder in PIATCO willing to invest further funds. Dr. Braune explained that \"[a] decision has to be made as soon as possible whether to implement the project with the full support of all shareholders (if need be, to be exchanged) or to abandon it\". Fraport accordingly decided to increase its shareholdings pursuant to two agreements dated 5 May 2000 (the \"2000 Share Purchase Agreements\"). Under these two agreements, Fraport acquired an additional 5% of PIATCO, and PTI acquired another 24% of PIATCO.\n\n131.\n\nIn 2001, Fraport acquired a 40% stake in PAGS, which resulted in Fraport having an additional 9.04% indirect interest in PIATCO. The Tribunal notes that, as of this point, Fraport had acquired 61.44% direct and indirect ownership of PIATCO.\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that, during this time, Fraport needed to secure longterm financing for PIATCO to ensure sufficient funds were available to complete the Terminal 3 project and recoup the bridge loans and loan guarantees to PIATCO. For this purpose, Dresdner Bank formed a lending consortium with Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (\"KfW\"), the Asian Development Bank (\"ADB\") and the International Finance Corporation (\"IFC\"). On 27 July 2001, KfW, ADB and IFC (collectively, the \"Senior Lenders\"), among others, accordingly entered into an \"Omnibus Agreement\" with PIATCO as Borrower for the purpose of financing the Terminal 3 project. The Omnibus Agreement included a \"Common Terms Agreement\", which in turn identified various \"conditions precedent\" (referred to, by the Respondent, as the 77 conditions precedent) that required resolution before the Senior Lenders would permit a drawdown of the loans, including:\n\n\u25cf Approval of the project, the ARCA, and the three Supplements by the cabinet-level ICC.\n\n\u25cf A shareholding structure acceptable to the Senior Lenders, which required reducing the Chengs' shareholding to less than fifty percent.\n\n\u25cf A legally binding commitment letter from Duty Free Philippines agreeing to: (1) close its flagship store, the Fiesta Mall; (2) relocate all duty-free operations in Metro Manila to Terminal 3; and (3) pay PIATCO fifteen percent of duty-free revenues at Terminal 3.\n\n\u25cf A Fourth Supplement to the ARCA in a form that was acceptable to the Senior Lenders and that, among other things, expanded the Government's obligations as regards attendant liabilities, *force majeure,* incremental and consequential costs, and other \"special obligations\".\n\n\u25cf An agreement with the Philippine Economic hone Authority (\"PEhA\") concerning PIATCO's obligation to make full use of the land allocated by the Government for the Terminal 3 project, in order to take advantage of certain tax advantages.\n\n\u25cf A certified copy of \"Presidential Full Powers Authority\", ratifying the DOTC's authority to have entered into agreements (such as the ARCA) on behalf of the Government.\n\n\u25cf A legal opinion from the Philippine Department of Justice approving the ARCA, its Supplements and the Government's Direct Agreement.\n\n\u25cf A legal opinion from the Philippine SEC attesting to the legality of PIATCO's shareholder arrangements.\n\n\u25cf Approval of the Government Direct Agreement by Government departments and agencies, including the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.\n\n133.\n\nSection 2 of the \"Common Terms Agreement\", entitled \"Conditions Precedent\", states as follows:\n\n\"2. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT\n\n*2.1 Initial Conditions Precedent*\n\n2.1.1 The Borrower may not submit a Notice of Drawdown in respect of the Initial Advance unless the Intercreditor Agent has notified the Borrower and each of the Senior Creditors that all of the Initial Conditions Precedent are in form and substance satisfactory to, or have been waived by, each of the Senior Lenders.\n\n2.1.2 The Intercreditor Agent will promptly give the notification in Clause 2.1.1 above upon receipt from each of the Senior Facility Agents of written confirmation that all of the Initial Conditions Precedent have been satisfied or waived (such confirmation to be given promptly by the Senior Facility Agents upon such satisfaction or waiver).\n\n*2.2 Conditions Precedent to each Advance*\n\nThe obligation of each of the Senior Lenders to participate in an Advance under a Senior Facility (including the Initial Advance) is subject to the further conditions that, on both the date of the Notice of Drawdown and the Drawdown Date of that Advance:\n\n2.2.1 (in the case of the Initial Advance only) the Senior Facility Agents are satisfied that the Initial Conditions Precedent remain satisfied or waived;\n\n2.2.2 the conditions set out in Part B of Schedule 3 (Conditions Precedent to each Advance) are in form and substance satisfactory to the Senior Facility Agent under that Senior Facility;\n\n2.2.3 all conditions precedent specifically set out in the relevant Senior Facility Agreement are in form and substance satisfactory to the Senior Facility Agent under that Senior Facility.\n\n*2.3 Waiver of Conditions Precedents*\n\n2.3.1 The initial Conditions Precedent may be waived only by all of the Senior Lenders.\n\n2.3.2 Conditions under Clause 2.2 (Conditions Precedent to each Advance) may be waived by each Senior Facility Agent in relation to the relevant Senior Facility Agreement.\"\n\n134.\n\nMany of the changes that the Senior Lenders were requesting as preconditions for the drawdown of long-term financing that Fraport had arranged were reflected in the draft Fourth Supplement (in addition to the DOTC's issuance of a letter to all airlines informing them that all international flights would have to go through Terminal 3 after the in-service date, and the relocation of Duty Free Philippines to Terminal 3). The Fourth Supplement was never executed.\n\n135.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that, on 8 June 2001, Fraport proceeded with an important IPO in Germany and that the Offering Circular, in a section entitled \"Risk Factors\", includes the following pertinent information regarding, *inter alia,* the issue of long-term financing:\n\n*\"Risks in connection with the NAIA International Passenger Terminal IPT 3 project in Manila*\n\n*Due to legal restrictions, Fraport AG has only limited commercial influence over the main project for the construction and operation of the new passenger terminal IPT3 at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (\"NAIA \") in Manila, Philippines; moreover, the time frame, costs and effects of pending changes of the project\u2019s shareholding structure cannot presently be estimated in detail.*\n\nThe NAIA IPT 3 project is currently one of Fraport's most capital-intensive projects and includes the financing, construction and operation of a new passenger terminal at NAIA. The main project company is the Philippine International Air Terminal Corporation Inc. (\"PIATCO\"), in which Fraport AG participates both directly and, through other companies, indirectly. According to Philippine law, the direct shareholdings of all foreign investors in PIATCO may not exceed 40 percent in the aggregate. Fraport AG's direct as well as indirect shareholdings in PIATCO currently amount to 52.4 percent in the aggregate. Thus, in spite of its substantial capital investment, Fraport AG can only exert limited influence over PIATCO's commercial decisions. The project is based on complex corporate legal and contractual structures. Discussions and negotiations are currently being held to secure the overall project, including, without limitation, the shareholding structure. There can be no assurance that these negotiations will be concluded successfully within the intended timeframe and without additional costs for Fraport AG or PIATCO. This could have a material adverse effect on Fraport's business activity, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n*The profitability of the overall project is dependent on obtaining business partners for the operation of the airport terminal and on resolving certain customs and tax issues affecting the legal status of PIATCO and PTI*\n\nThe profitability of the entire terminal project rests upon PIATCO'S cooperation with competent and commercially viable business partners on appropriate terms. In terms of profitability, it is particularly important that duty-free outlets be operated exclusively in the new IPT 3 terminal and that all international flights be transferred to this terminal. However, there can be no assurance that these two goals will be achieved. Additionally, the customs and tax status of PIATCO and the future operating company Philippine Airport Ground Services Terminal, Inc. (\"PTI\") *[sic],* for which individual issues still require resolution, has a significant impact on the results of operations of the entire project. To the extent that these prerequisites for the profitability of the project cannot be met, this could have a material adverse effect on Fraport's business activity, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n*The success of the entire project depends on the granting of permits from relevant public authorities*\n\nThe success of the entire project depends upon the granting of a large number of permits, concessions, consents and similar authorizations from governmental bodies, including the consent of the Philippine government for PTI to operate the terminal. A few of these permits are also important for the project's financing. Some of the required permits and similar authorizations are still outstanding. There can be no assurance that all required permits will be granted in the timeframe anticipated by Fraport, if at all. If the required permits and similar authorizations are not granted or are only granted after considerable delay, the project could fail or its results of operations could be materially diminished. This could have a material adverse effect on Fraport AG's business activity, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n*The timely and complete implementation of the terminal project depends substantially on obtaining financing and sponsor support*\n\nPIATCO presently needs considerable bridge financing to secure the entire Project until long-term financing arrangements have been concluded. Fraport AG may be required to assume this bridge financing or a significant portion thereof. Furthermore, the provisions of the concession contract require that PIATCO maintains an equity ratio of 30 percent (without taking subordinate shareholder loans into account as either equity or debt). Other government agencies may impose even more stringent capital ratio requirements, which would increase further Fraport's financing burden. Declines in the value of the Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar, which in turn have led to changes in other currency exchanges rates, have occurred in the past. These changes have created additional funding risks for PIATCO shareholders, and it is possible that these risks could reoccur in the future. Moreover, the banks financing the project are likely to require the shareholders to contribute additional equity capital to PIATCO.\n\nPIATCO's long-term external financing has not been secured and is contingent on its strengthening its shareholding structure. This restructuring must take into account restrictions on foreign shareholdings in PIATCO and PIATCO's direct and indirect shareholders and ensure the profitable operation of the terminal through corresponding agreements. If it is not possible to achieve the prerequisites for long-term bank financing, Fraport AG will have to continue to carry or assume disproportionate economic risks from the loans it has granted and the collateral it has provided, without being able to participate to the same extent in the project's dividends. Even if long-term bank financing can be secured, Fraport AG may have to provide disproportionate financial support (so-called sponsor support) for the equity capital and liabilities of PIATCO. In either case, Fraport may have to provide substantial additional financing that could have a material adverse effect on its business activity, financial condition and results of operations. If long-term financing is not obtained, PIATCO may become insolvent. This would lead to a loss of the investments made up to that time and could thus have a material adverse effect on Fraport's business activity, financial condition and results of operations.\"\n\n136.\n\nThat section of the Offering Circular concluded prophetically as follows:\n\n*\"Political developments in the Philippines could jeopardize the success of the project*\n\nRecently, political relations within the Philippines have become unstable. Because of the project's significance to Philippine air traffic infrastructure, political relations are also of considerable significance to the project. Unforeseen changes in political relations, unrest or similar developments could have a negative impact on the project's completion. This could have a material adverse effect on Fraport's business activity, financial condition and results of operations.\"\n\n**D. Opposition To The Terminal 3 Project**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Transfer of International Operations to Terminal 3 and PAL's Emergence from Bankruptcy**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nIn the late 1990s, PAL had suffered major financial losses and entered rehabilitation following then-President Ramos' liberalization of the Philippines' domestic and international airline industry. PAL thus introduced severe cost-cutting measures and reduced international destinations from 30 to 4 and domestic destinations from 39 to 14. But PAL's troubles continued and it was forced to cease all operations in September 1998 due to a breakdown in negotiations with its creditors and employees.\n\n138.\n\nBy this time, PAL's emergence from rehabilitation depended heavily upon renewed pledges of commitment by the Government, which the Government acknowledged in rehabilitation proceedings:\n\n\"The Government of the Republic of the Philippines has committed, and will continue to commit itself to the rehabilitation of PAL. In demonstration of such commitment, the government has undertaken a review of the air rights granted to certain competing regional airlines to ensure that PAL will no longer be unfairly disadvantaged and can operate profitably under the Amended Plan as the National Flag Carrier.\"\n\n139.\n\nOne important feature of PAL's rehabilitation plan was for all operations of PAL at NAIA, both domestic and international, to be relocated to Terminal 2. On 10 August 1999 - one day after the inaugural opening of Terminal 2 - PAL moved its operations exclusively to the new Terminal 2. Mr. Lucio Tan said the opening of the new terminal indicated that \"PAL is well on its way to reclaiming its accustomed place among the leaders of Asian aviation\". By late 2000, just three years after being grounded by bankruptcy and forced into receivership, PAL had gained back many of its lost routes.\n\n140.\n\nWithin weeks of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, however, PAL announced that it had \"suspended all expansion plans\" until the impact of the terrorist attacks became clearer. PAL announced in November 2001 that it expected to suffer a quarterly loss for the first time in two years. Throughout the next several months, PAL continued to report that it expected to lose money for its fiscal year ending in March 2002. In May of 2002, PAL announced that it had unaudited losses of US$30.3 million dollars.\n\n141.\n\nUnder the Concession Agreement, PAL's international operations were to be relocated prior to the Terminal 3 in-service date. Even before September 11, the aviation press had described the award of the contract for the construction of Terminal 3 to the PIATCO group as a \"setback for PAL\". In post-September 11 testimony to the Philippine Congress, Mr. Perfecto Yasay, the former chairman of the Philippine SEC at the time when PAL's rehabilitation plan was approved, who by this time had become a spokesperson for a group of businesses known as MASO (\"MIA-NAIA Association of Service Operators\"3), was more direct, stating that the relocation of international operations to Terminal 3 would \"signal the start of PAL's collapse\".\n\nThese businesses include Cargohaus Inc., Dnata-Wings Aviation System Corp., MacroAsia-Eurest Catering Services Inc., MacroAsia-Ogden Airport Services Corp., the Miascor Group of Companies and PAL.\n\n**2. The MASO Campaign**\n------------------------\n\n142.\n\nOpposition to the Terminal 3 project was voiced by MASO which, as noted earlier, comprised a group of businesses, including PAL, that had contracts to provide airline-related services in Terminals 1 and 2. In essence, the MASO members feared their companies would be prohibited from operating in Terminal 3 because of the exclusivity clause of the concession arrangements in favour of PIATCO with respect to international passenger operations. In particular, PAL did not want to move to Terminal 3 because it had consolidated operations in Terminal 2 and was reportedly not charged fees for use of the terminal. Ostensibly because of these concerns, the Tribunal notes that MASO launched a vigorous and unrelenting campaign to keep Terminal 3 from entering into service or to cause significant amendments to the concession arrangements which PIATCO held.\n\n143.\n\nMASO began its campaign in late June 2001, the month before the planned execution of PIATCO's long-term finance arrangements pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement referred to earlier in this Award. The Tribunal notes that MASO wrote to the lenders alleging that PAGS had been inducing MASO's clients to enter into service agreements with PAGS by promising to deliver certain favours or concessions when PAGS took over operations at Terminal 3, and attempted to dissuade the lenders from loaning money to PIATCO. MASO referred in this letter to the allegedly \"onerous and illegal provisions\" of the concession agreements and vowed PAL would \"go to the highest court of the land\" in order not to leave Terminal 2. After tying the concession agreements to the disgraced Estrada administration, and without recognizing that the concession had been awarded to PIATCO under President Ramos and that the Third Supplement had been executed under President Macapagal-Arroyo, MASO asked whether it was in the banks' \"charter to lend money to companies that take advantage of poorer countries by exploiting the weaknesses of some of its public servants, who, in the end, feel no remorse for selling their own country down the drain\". MASO emphasized that the 25-year concession would outlast several Philippine administrations and asked the lenders: \"Do you really want to be worrying about the contract every time there is an election?\"\n\n144.\n\nMASO also wrote a letter to President Macapagal-Arroyo in the summer of 2001, asserting \"this Concession Agreement was suspiciously, if not surreptitiously, amended once and supplemented two times by the Erap Administration, through former DOTC Secretary Vincente Rivera, Jr., to further favour PIATCO and place the government at the losing end\". In this letter to the President, MASO said it was prepared to got to court, but that \"will create a public spectacle that could put the country in a bad light\", and pleaded with her to have the agreements \"reviewed by your new anti-graft body and rectify this onerous contract immediately before this becomes a national embarrassment that the entire world will see\".\n\n145.\n\nIn addition, MASO began a public relations attack on the Terminal 3 project by taking out advertisements in four major Manila newspapers. MASO's advertisements were essentially \"open letters\" to DOTC Secretary Alvarez, stating on the purported behalf of the \"Filipino people, the local companies operating in the airport, and the airlines\", that the PIATCO concession arrangements should be invalidated.\n\n146.\n\nFraport expressed concern to the highest levels of the Philippine Government about the efforts on the part of MASO and others to dissuade the lenders from financing the project. In particular, on 30 November 2001, Fraport wrote to President Macapagal-Arroyo. Fraport wrote:\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that this ambitious Project, which is designed to serve 13 million passengers annually with its state-of-the-art facilities at no cost the Philippine Government, has become the subject of political disputes which are paralysing the honest efforts of all parties involved to achieve the conditions precedent for a first draw-down of the credit facilities in the near future. It makes us particularly concerned that the validity of the Amended and Restated Concession Agreement of PIATCO, which forms the legal basis of the whole Project, and the legality of which had been confirmed, *inter alia,* by the Committee on Transport and Communication, is now being put in question again.\n\nOne of the political arguments raised against this Project is the allegation that the development and prosperity of the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (\"DMIA\") and of the whole province of Pampanga would be adversely affected by this Project. Presently, DMIA serves around 50,000 passengers per year, and it is evident that the development of DMIA will take its time until the design capacity of 850,000 passengers per year has been reached. By then, however, it appears that NAIA IPT 3 will already have reached its design capacity for three consecutive years so that the restrictions to the further upgrade of the facilities at DMIA will no longer be applicable.\n\nWe do not have any doubts that the Philippine Government will act in accordance with the constitution and the law, and that the Philippine Government will always follow the principle of 'pacta sunt servanda'. Nevertheless, we would like to ask you, Madam President, for all possible political support for this Project, which support is urgently needed by the Project and PIATCO to overcome the present standstill in relation to various aspects of the negotiations with the Philippine Government.\n\nNot only international investors, but also the credit institutions from all over the world look closely on this Project and place their confidence on a reliable climate for foreign investment in the Philippines to foster the prosperity of the people and for the mutual benefit of all parties concerned.\n\nWe therefore pray for your support for this Project and for a reliable environment for foreign investment in your great country.\"\n\n147.\n\nOne of the PIATCO's long-term lenders, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, also expressed its concerns to President Macapagal-Arroyo in a letter dated 3 December 2001:\n\n\"Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) is willing to support the long term financing of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) International Passenger Terminal III project (the \"Project\"), based on its financial viability. KfW forms part of a bank consortium of leading international and multilateral financing institutions comprising Asian Development Bank (ADB), International Finance Corporation (IFC) as well as Dresdner Bank. As you know, KfW - like the other development banks involved in the Project - has been financing successfully projects over decades within the Philippines and in the region, both through financial co-operation and through commercial export and project finance.\n\nAs the Project is providing state-of-the-art facilities to serve 13 million passengers annually at NAIA, it is a major contribution to the transportation infrastructure of the Philippines. It fosters mobility throughout the region, thereby adding valuable economic benefits to the Philippines. With Fraport as major sponsor, the Project will benefit from the know-how of one of the world's leading airport operators. All of this is especially remarkable in the world's and South East Asia's current economic situation. The macro-economic benefits of the Project for your country and the involvement of a highly qualified private sponsor such as Fraport are a major consideration for KfW to participate.\n\nUnfortunately, we have noted with concern that certain issues - which are outlined in a separate letter of Fraport to you \u2014 have arisen that may cause delays to the completion of the Project. As we all share the same goals, namely the successful conclusion of the Project, we would highly appreciate your support to resolve the open issues in a joint effort.\"\n\n148.\n\nNot surprisingly, the need for a solution in light of the circumstances obtaining in the Philippines was referred to by Fraport in its 2001 Annual Report to its shareholders:\n\n\"Our BOT (build, operate, transfer) project for a new international terminal at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in the Philippine capital of Manila presented difficulties in 2001. Construction is on target and the opening is scheduled for November 2002. Because of a changed forecast of future profitability, we made a write-down. In addition, political difficulties have arisen in connection with this project, which were not expected when we first undertook the commitment. We are vigorously working on a solution.\"\n\n**E. The Collapse of Fraport's Investment**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Early Discussions with Secretary Climaco**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nLate in 2001, in the midst of MASO's public campaign against the Terminal 3 project, President Macapagal-Arroyo appointed Gloria L. Tan Climaco as a presidential advisor on strategic projects. Pursuant to Executive Order No. 79, President Macapagal-Arroyo formally elevated Ms. Climaco to full cabinet rank in March 2002. Her presidential mandate included the express authority to review the Terminal 3 concession.\n\n150.\n\nShortly after her appointment, on 10 December 2001, Secretary Climaco held meetings with Fraport and PIATCO representatives, namely Mr. Bernd L. Struck (Executive Vice-President of Fraport and PIATCO's Chairman of the Board), Mr. Johannes Endler (Fraport's Chief Financial Officer), Dr. Deitrich F.R. Stiller (Clifford Chance Punder) and Mr. Hans-Arthur Vogel (PIATCO's Finance Director). The Fraport attendees reported that this first meeting with Secretary Climaco had been \"friendly\" and \"cooperative\". The minutes of meeting reveal that the parties discussed, *inter alia,* the following:\n\n\"1. Sec. Climaco opened the discussion by mentioning that a number of concerns have been raised with respect to the agreements relating to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3 (NAIA 3), among which is the lack of NEDA-ICC approval for the Amended and Restated Concession Agreement and its 3 supplements. Apparently a 4th supplement [is] pending before DOTC Sec. Pantaleon Alvarez.\n\n3. Fraport, through Mr. Struck, said they acknowledge the necessity for approval of these documents by the NEDA-ICC. However, the Terminal is 60% complete with outside structures finished and work continuing on the structures within the Terminal. The approval for these amendments to the original Concession Agreement, as well as the 4th supplement, is necessary for their senior lenders to release the loans needed to finance the Project. [...] Fraport hopes to comply with its conditions precedent for financial drawdowns soon so that it can recover its advances to PIATCO. It has been advancing funds because its local partners have not been able to invest more than US$50 Million to the Project because of restrictions imposed by local laws. [NB: figures subject to verification]\n\n4. Sec. Climaco assured Fraport that the government will be fair, and this was acknowledged by Fraport. It would after all be to the best interests of both parties to settle pending issues expediently.\n\n5. There are MASO contracts whose validity extend beyond the targeted InService Date in 2002. Mr. Struck gave his views that MASO is being sponsored by Messrs. Tan and Delgado for their respective business considerations.\n\n10. Mr. Struck mentioned that in their view, an approval by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and by the NEDA-ICC of the Amended and Restated Concession Agreement and the supplements thereto would be ideal.\n\n11. Mr. Struck said that they have discussed the exclusivity provision with respect to the Clark Terminal with their senior lenders and the latter are amendable to relinquishing that right. In return, however, they would want to be given the right to operate the Clark Terminal.\"\n\n151.\n\nThe Fraport executives attending the meeting of 10 December 2001 also reported:\n\n\"We have noted that shortly after the meeting with Hon. Gloria Tan-Climaco there appeared certain articles in the German and Philippine press, according to which the Concession Agreement would need to be substantially renegotiated. We do not know from which sources such misleading information originated. However, the truth is that the issues raised by the Philippine Government might lead to certain amendments of the Concession Agreement, as the issues raised by the Senior Lenders which should lead to certain other amendments of the Concession Agreement as set out in the draft Fourth Supplement to the Concession Agreement. This appears to us as a normal bargaining situation where one party agrees to certain changes in consideration of the agreement of the other party to other changes. We do not have any reasons to believe that the Philippine Government would not comply with its obligations under the existing contracts, or bring forward unreasonable demands which might jeopardize the commercial and legal basis of the concession.\"\n\n152.\n\nOn 19 December 2001, in a memorandum entitled \"Expression of Concern by Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide and Kreditanstalt for Wiederaufbau on the NAIA Terminal 3 Project\" addressed to Executive Secretary Romulo, Secretary Climaco described her first meeting with Fraport as follows:\n\n\"The concerns of Fraport were mutually discussed in a meeting held with their representatives on 10 December 2001. A copy of the minutes of said meeting is attached for your perusal. We proposed that the open issues concerning Fraport and the Philippine Government be discussed in further detail in order to resolve the same at the soonest possible time and Fraport agreed to commence discussions in January 2002. We gather that Fraport subsequently referred its concerns and the discussions in this meeting to Philippine International Air Terminals Co. Inc. (PIATCO), the concessionaire for the NAIA Terminal 3 Project, and in a letter of PIATCO dated 11 December 2001 to the undersigned. PIATCO expressed its concern that matters relating to the Project be discussed with PIATCO directly.\"\n\n153.\n\nDuring this time, Secretary Climaco also met with PIATCO representatives. During the first of these meetings on 7 January 2002, Secretary Climaco indicated that, although the Government planned to honour the concession agreements, it wanted revisions to be made to address the concerns of MASO; she stated that certain provisions in the concession agreements were too onerous.\n\n154.\n\nAt a further meeting held on 21 January 2002 at which Fraport and PAL representatives were invited, Dr. Georg Braune of Dresdner Bank, Fraport's financial adviser for the Terminal 3 project, made a presentation. Dr. Braune sought to demonstrate to Secretary Climaco that the changes to the concession arrangements she had proposed on 7 January 2002 would be unacceptable to the Senior Lenders. In her first witness statement to the Tribunal, Secretary Climaco stated:\n\n\"Dr. Georg Braune of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein made a presentation explaining from the lenders' view the Project's unsatisfactory situation. Dr. Braune raised concerns about the lack of an agreement with Duty Free Philippines (\"DFP\") to move to Terminal 3; PAL's reluctance to move to Terminal 3; and that the Project's internal rate of return at the PIATCO level was dropping. Mr. Braune said that he would show me the financial model. At the same meeting, Mr. Struck also discussed the possibility of having PIATCO operate Terminal 2 and the Government becoming a PIATCO shareholder.\"\n\n155.\n\nFurther discussions were held the next day, on 22 January 2002. PIATCO handed a document to Secretary Climaco entitled \"List of Action Items Involving the Philippine Government\". This list set forth 18 key items, including 13 items identified as the \"conditions precedent in loan documents\" and 5 items identified as \"other issues\". The Tribunal considers that this list should be reproduced:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ***Item*** | *Description* |\n| **I.

PAL submitted its \"shopping list\" and presented demands that would have to be met if it was to operate out of Terminal 3, principally a simultaneous transfer of its domestic operations as well as its international operations from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3. PAL also stated that, if it relocated to Terminal 3, it wanted to incur no greater charges or fees for the first five years than it paid in Terminal 2. PAL also stated that it expected to perform its own ground handling operations.\n\n**2. Secretary Climaco's Negotiations with Fraport and PIATCO**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nOn 23 January 2002, negotiations began in earnest when Secretary Climaco submitted the proposed Fifth Supplement to the ARCA which, according to her witness statement, contained \"the necessary changes to the ARCA that would make it to the fullest extent possible accord with the Bid Documents and, therefore, acceptable for the Government\". One of the main provisions of the draft Fifth Supplement required that PIATCO surrender the exclusivity of Terminal 3 for international passenger operations at NAIA.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the \"Exclusivity\" provision in the ARCA read as follows:\n\n**\"Section 3.02 Exclusivity.**\n\n(a) During the Term of this Agreement, GRP undertakes and guarantees that Concessionaire shall have the exclusive right to operate a commercial international passenger terminal within the Island of Luzon, with the exception of those already existing at the time of the execution of this Agreement, specifically, the airports at the Subic Bay Freeport Special Economic Zone (SBFSEZ), Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ) and Laoag City. With regard to CSEZ, GRP shall ensure that no new terminal facilities shall be operated therein until such time as the Development Facility Capacity shall have been consistently reached or exceeded for three (3) consecutive years during the Concession Period. 'Development Facility Capacity' refers to the ten million (10,000,000) passenger capacity per year of the Development Facility.\"\n\n160.\n\nThe draft Fifth Supplement envisaged that this provision would be replaced by the following:\n\n**\"Section 3.02 Exclusivity.**\n\n(a) On the In-Service Date, GRP shall cause the closure of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Passenger Terminals I and II as international passenger terminals. Neither shall GRP, DOTC or MIAA use or permit the use of Terminals I and/or II under any arrangement or scheme, for compensation or otherwise, with any party which would directly or indirectly compete with Concessionaire in the latter's operation of and the operations in the Terminal and Terminal Complex, including without limitation the use of Terminals I and/or II for the handling of international traffic; provided that if Terminals I and/or II are operated as domestic passenger terminals, the conduct of any activity therein which under the ordinary course of operating a domestic passenger terminal is normally undertaken, shall not be considered to be in direct or indirect competition with Concessionaire in its operation of the Development Facility.\"\n\n161.\n\nAfter having reviewed the draft Fifth Supplement, PIATCO wrote to Secretary Climaco on 4 February 2002 and concluded categorically that \"we are not in a position to agree on a reopening of the ARCA\". PIATCO said:\n\n\"On behalf of Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc. (PIATCO), we wish to thank you for meeting with us on several occasions to find a workable and acceptable solution to all the issues raised in connection with the construction, development and operation of the NAIA IPT3 Project.\n\nWe wish to stress that the Amended and Restated Concession Agreement (ARCA) dated 20 November 1998 between PIATCO as Concessionaire and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) is a valid and legally binding document signed in good faith by the representatives of PIATCO and the Philippine Government, and approved by ICC-NEDA on 25 June 1999. The ARCA has long been in implementation, with both parties mutually exercising their rights there under. We respectfully submit that we are not in a position to agree on a reopening of the ARCA.\n\nMoreover, a reopening of the ARCA will be unacceptable to the Senior Lenders of PIATCO who have structured the credit facilities and their financial projections around the current provisions of the ARCA.\n\nA review of the proposed 5th Supplement to the ARCA have *[sic]* led us to believe that such 5th Supplement is tantamount to a renegotiation and reopening of the ARCA and if agreed to, will definitely have a negative impact on the financing arrangement between PIATCO and the Senior Lenders. This may then lead to the inability of PIATCO to draw from such credit facilities.\n\nWe were hoping that the proposed 5\\* Supplement would have contained the 'win/win' solution for PIATCO and GRP that we were discussing.\n\nNevertheless, we are prepared to discuss with GRP the issue related to the development of the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (formerly Clark International Airport), which, we understand, is a major political concern to the present Administration.\n\nAs also discussed during our previous meetings and in the spirit of our mutual cooperation, we would like to request your invaluable assistance in obtaining certain consents and documents from GRP, which are required by the Senior Lenders of PIATCO. These consents and documents are listed in Annex 'A' hereof.\"\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Senior Lenders' conditions precedent for long-term financing were expressly discussed with Secretary Climaco from the outset. In this regard, the Tribunal further observes that Fraport's financial adviser for the Terminal 3 project, Dr. Georg Braune of Dresdner Bank, participated in the early discussions with Secretary Climaco, PIATCO and Fraport. In a letter dated 26 January 2002, Dr. Braune of Dresdner Bank wrote to Fraport in order to convey his assessment of these discussions, indicating that there were problems, but they were not insurmountable from the Dresdner Bank's point of view.\n\n163.\n\nOn 27 January 2002, *i.e.* the day after Fraport received Dresdner Bank's assessment of the Project's profitability, Dr. Hippe of Fraport circulated an internal memorandum addressed to Mr. Endler and copied to Mr. Struck, Dr. Baune and Dr. Stiller. This memorandum summarized, *inter alia,* the January meetings with Secretary Climaco, and indicated that Fraport had made it clear to her that \"the results achieved to date are not enough to prevent a massive write-off. Dr. Hippe referred expressly to Dresdner Bank's assessment and the scenarios discussed therein, and went on to conclude that \"[i]f however the likelihood increases that the above mentioned scenarios come into play in the further negotiations, a considerable valuation adjustment for Fraport must be assumed, which would impact the 2001 financial statements totally. This would require a further injection of capital by Fraport.\"\n\n164.\n\nAgainst this background, on 1 February 2002, Fraport wrote to PIATCO as follows:\n\n\"We write to you in our capacity as one of the Project sponsors of Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc. ('PIATCO') in relation to the Project.\n\nAfter the signing of the long-term financing agreements for the Project on 27 July 2001 and after the release from escrow of the said agreements on 26 August 2001, Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, as Project sponsor, has continuously exerted its best efforts to cooperate and coordinate with PIATCO to enable PIATCO to comply with the conditions precedent for draw-down under its long-term financing agreements. However, supervening events in the political and economic environment of the Project has made compliance with the conditions precedent an extremely complicated and volatile process. You are already no doubt aware of the substantial change in international passenger traffic projections following the September 11 events and the resulting dismal projections on the project's economics including without limitation duty-free spendings. We also note the extremely political situation of the Project that has required considerable effort and attention from you and your management team. The collective effect of these factors is to make compliance with the conditions precedent extremely difficult and to make any draw-down in 2002 highly uncertain. Without interim financing, which should be in place by February 2002, PIATCO will have an untenable financial condition and defaults in its contractual obligations is *[sic]* highly foreseeable. Another foreseeable consequence is that PIATCO would not be in a position to enter into contracts which give rise to new obligations, and this would inevitably lead to a standstill and most probably to a failure of the Project.\n\nThe amount of the required additional interim financing for the period from February 2002 to December 2002 is estimated at USD 162.5million. This amount\n\n\u25cf Already includes a possible bridge financing in the form of an accelerated set-off of advance payments made to the EPC Contractors against progress payment claims of the EPC Contractors in the amount of USD 45 million which is presently negotiated with the EPC Contractors,\n\n\u25cf but it is in addition to a USD 39 million increase of a Fraport-guaranteed bank bridge loan facility, which we hope will push through during the course of the next days.\n\nAs we continue to give our full support to the Project, and as we continue to have interest in the success of the Project, we are however unable to extend any form of further financial support pending compliance with all the conditions precedent to draw-down under PIATCO's long-term financing agreements. Our Board of Directors and our Supervisory Board are, under the present conditions, no longer in a position to approve any further financial exposure for our company in the Project in addition to the already tremendous financial support that Fraport has extended to the Project, and in addition to the support granted to increase the Fraport guaranteed bank bridge loan facility from USD 126 million by USD 39 million to USD 165 million, subject always to the overall limits set out in the Additional Agreement dated December 21, 2001. Our company therefore exhorts and urges the management of PIATCO to exert its best efforts to obtain interim financing or other form of alternative financing for PIATCO to enable it to comply with its payments obligations this fiscal year 2002 and to operate on a more solid financial basis. We urge you to seek the financial support of the other Project sponsors, whether in the form of direct financing or other form of sponsor support.\n\nWe can not emphasize enough the urgency of putting this interim financing in place as soon as possible. We look forward and hope that the management of PIATCO will receive firm commitments of financial support from the other Project sponsors.\"\n\n165.\n\nMeanwhile, Secretary Climaco was also making a number of inquiries regarding the Project's financial model, including the Project's \"soft costs\". Referring to meetings held on 2 and 4 February 2002 in this connection, Secretary Climaco wrote to PIATCO's President on 5 February 2002. She said:\n\n\"As you are aware, some members of my project team met with your Messrs. Hans-Arthur Vogel and Georg D. Braune last Saturday, 02 February 2002, to discuss certain queries regarding the Financial Model which Mr. Braune furnished us previously. This is to provide us with a clearer understanding of the economics of the NAIA Terminal 3 Project which, in turn, will help the government fairly address the issues PIATCO is now facing. Unfortunately, most of the questions posed by my project team members were left unanswered, and instead, we were requested to provide a list of these queries so that the same may be replied to point by point.\"\n\n166.\n\nOn 6 February 2002, Secretary Climaco again wrote to PIATCO in connection with the latter's letter of 4 February 2002 regarding the draft Fifth Supplement. She stated that \"[i]t is disappointing that at this late stage of our negotiations, Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc. (PIATCO) has taken the stance it has in this letter, as if it was caught unaware that its concession agreement with the Government requires the changes which the Government has proposed in the draft 5th Supplement to address infirmities which its concession has sustained because of changes initiated by PIATCO every year since the time it was awarded the concession for the NAIA Terminal 3 Project in 1997\". She went on:\n\n\"Changes to the original Concession Agreement of 1997, which itself appears to be a departure from the draft concession agreement in the Bid Documents, were proposed yearly by PIATCO - in 1998 through the Amended Y Restated Concession Agreement (ARCA); in 1999 through the First Supplement; in 2000 through the Second Supplement; and in 2001 through the Third Supplement; and in 2001-2002 ; with a draft Fourth Supplement pending before the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), all of which are being questioned on legal, political, economical, and moral grounds by several sectors, and not without reason. Even grievances on PIATCO's manner of implementing its concession, at this stage where Terminal 3 is not even in its operational phase, has *[sic]* been raised before the Government. Government's draft 5\\* Supplement was one of several actions we deem necessary to address these issues, and this was explained to you and your local and foreign lawyers on different occasions.\n\nNonetheless, we shall address each of the points raised in your 04 February letter.\n\n*First,* PIATCO claims that it is 'not in a position to agree on a reopening of the ARCA'. Without prejudice to legal objections to the ARCA, we believe PIATCO is not in a position to say it is not in a position to reopen the ARCA since it has constantly done so in 1999, 2000, and 2001. In fact, the first action which you requested us to address in Annex A to your 04 February letter is your draft Fourth Supplement now pending before the DOTC, which would have been the change to the ARCA for 2002, tantamount to the fourth reopening of the ARCA. Neither does it appear to be your intention to let these annual changes end with the draft Fourth Supplement, since the first item of said annex likewise speaks ofOther amendments and supplements, including clarifying letters to the Concession Agreement.' Thus far, reopening the ARCA appears to be an annual activity. Your actions appear inconsistent with your statement.\n\n*Second,* PIATCO claims that 'a reopening of the ARCA will be unacceptable to the Senior Lenders of PIATCO who have structured the credit facilities and their financial projections around the current provisions of the ARCA. A review of the proposed 5\\* Supplement to the ARCA have *[sic]* led us to believe that such 5\\* Supplement is tantamount to a renegotiation and reopening of the ARCA, and if agreed to, will definitely have a negative impact on the financing arrangement between PIATCO and the Senior Lenders. This may then lead to the inability of PIATCO to draw from such credit facilities.' Have the Senior Lenders been apprised of the three supplements and the pending draft fourth supplement which have reopened the ARCA? We see no difference in the action to be taken by PIATCO on its proposed draft Fourth Supplement and Government's draft 5th Supplement. We believe that the effect of the 5 th Supplement, on the whole and in the long run, is to strengthen the concession granted to PIATCO. PIATCO's Senior Lenders only stand to benefit from a strengthened concession. From the undersigned's very first meeting with you, and time and again thereafter, we informed you that the concerns of PIATCO's Senior Lenders will be met provided all pending issues relating to PIATCO's concession and its implementation thereof are suitably addressed. The latter should take precedence over the former.\n\n*Third,* PIATCO expressed its sentiment 'We were hoping that the proposed 5th Supplement would have contained the 'win/win' solution for PIATCO and GRP that we were discussing.' The 5th Supplement is one of several actions proposed to be taken to solve the issues surrounding the NAIA Terminal 3 Project. The undersigned has stressed that given all that has transpired, a 'win/win situation' may be difficult to conceive at this point, although we are nonetheless constantly exerting efforts to arrive at other legal acceptable solutions. The issues concerning the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport and consents and documents which you listed in Annex A of your letter, have always been part of these discussions.\n\nIt is only in the spirit of cooperation, fairness, and good faith that all issues besieging PIATCO and the Project may be resolved. We trust that this spirit shall govern our relations.\"\n\n167.\n\nSecretary Climaco and representatives of PIATCO met again on 7 February 2002. PIATCO then submitted a presentation regarding the Project's financial model in response to Secretary Climaco's queries. Secretary Climaco also continued to meet with Fraport representatives during this time.\n\n168.\n\nOn 15 February 2002, Fraport met with President Macapagal-Arroyo and raised with her, as with Secretary Climaco, the possibility that the Chengs' share participation in PIATCO be diluted and that the Government eventually become a shareholder in PIATCO.\n\n169.\n\nTwo weeks later, on 1 March 2002, Secretary Climaco wrote to Mr. Endler indicating that \"[i]t does not appear feasible to obtain a written consent between the Government and Fraport on further proceedings\", and also indicated that discussions with PIATCO had been \"hampered\", in part due to her \"project cost\" inquiries.\n\n170.\n\nOn 7 March 2002, Mr. Stiller wrote to Mr. Endler and Mr. Struck. He warned his colleagues:\n\n\"I believe that we have to rethink our strategy. For the known legal concerns a Memorandum of Understanding (or a similar document) will not be achievable within the next future. We therefore have to focus on\n\n\u25cf negotiating with our local partner whatever changes in the shareholding structure and / or the relevant agreements we want to achieve from them,\n\n\u25cf making sure that our local partner co-operates with the Philippine Government in all respects where such co-operation is required or advisable to solve the existing problems (one difficulty in this respect will be that not all members of the government speak with one voice),\n\n\u25cf co-ordinating a joint approach in all relevant negotiations with the government and third parties,\n\n\u25cf convincing our local partners *[sic]* to move where he has to move to rescue this project (including without limitation to increase its flexibility in the areas of ground handling and warehousing),\n\n\u25cf working out which conditions precedent (milestones) need to be achieved from our side before any additional financing could be made available to PIATCO, if any\n\n\u25cf being prepared that pressure from congress (investigations) and MASO will further increase, and that senior officers of Fraport will be directly made subject of suspicions and investigations; Mr. Struck seems to be the first target, but others might follow,\n\n\u25cf protecting the interests of Fraport and of all representatives of Fraport in a hostile environment,\n\n\u25cf continuing to talk to the government in a way where their and Fraport's representatives' face can be saved to bring this project forward, because we do not have influence on the government, but the government has strongest influence on the project.\n\nIn addition, we need to monitor the situation with respect to Fraport's obligations as a public listed corporation (WPHG etc.).\"\n\n171.\n\nWhile Secretary Climaco continued to meet with Fraport in March 2002, President Macapagal-Arroyo held a news conference. The President addressed the restrictions on the development of Clark Airport, which by then had been re-named Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (\"DMIA\") in honour of President Macapagal-Arroyo's father. During the press conference, President Macapagal-Arroyo announced that she had signed a memorandum order authorizing Secretary Climaco to renegotiate the contract with PIATCO so that her government would be able to \"freely undertake efforts to fully develop the DMIA as an international airport\". President Macapagal-Arroyo quoted from the memorandum:\n\n\"As Presidential Advisor for Strategic Projects, you are hereby instructed to pursue the negotiations, among others, to revise the restrictions on the development of the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport under the provisions of the amended and restated concession agreement between the Philippine government and the Philippine International Air Terminals Co. Inc. in order that the government may freely undertake efforts to fully develop the DMIA as an international airport.\"\n\n172.\n\nApproximately one month later, on 11 April 2002, Secretary Climaco provided President Macapagal-Arroyo with a written \"update\" regarding the Terminal 3 project. She stressed that the \"issues pending with the Government may be divided into legal, commercial, and legal-commercial issues. It was made clear to [Fraport representatives] that the legal issues are non-negotiable, while the commercial and legal-commercial issues are negotiable to the extent permitted by law.\"\n\n173.\n\nSince, in the opinion of Fraport, little progress was being made, Fraport decided to change the leader of its Manila team and dispatched the Vice Chairman of its Executive Board to make a personal assessment of the situation. The new team leader was Peter Henkel, Senior Vice-President of Fraport's Special Projects Division. A meeting between Mr. Henkel and Executive Board Vice Chairman Manfred Scholch, among others, with Secretary Climaco was scheduled for 17 April 2002.\n\n174.\n\nThis meeting between Fraport and Secretary Climaco was followed by an internal memorandum within Fraport, signed *inter alia* by Mr. Henkel. Under the heading \"Options for action\", the memorandum concluded:\n\n\"The long-term financing depends on the guaranteed profitability. This is not assured either on the basis of the CA 1997 or the basis of the ARCA 1998 without adding the 4th Supplement. However, the Government can successfully stymie the latter. What is more, it insists on the 5th Supplement, which jeopardizes the profitability of the project even more.\n\nResult: The project is doomed without a willingness to cooperate on the part of the Government. According to the way things are, cooperation with the Government is only possible if we succeed in convincing the Cheng family to give up their shares in PIATCO, if need be against payment of a reasonable amount, or to prove their criminal behavior and take court action against them. It remains to be seen whether we could pull it off. It is difficult to conceive that we can without the Government's help.\"\n\n175.\n\nOn 14 June 2002, evidencing the on-going discussions, Secretary Climaco provided Fraport with another list containing a series of \"Commercial Items\", 27 \"Legal Matters\" and 14 \"Other Matters\". A few days later, as part of a further update dated 19 June 2002 to President Macapagal-Arroyo, Secretary Climaco characterized this list as a \"Term Sheet\" of \"pertinent renegotiating points\". As part of this same update, Secretary Climaco briefed President Macapagal-Arroyo as follows:\n\n\"5. Fraport's immediate concern involves the coming shareholder's meeting on 26 June 2002. It is the first time for Fraport to have a large shareholder's meeting since it was only made a public company in 2001. They anticipate several contentious issues to be raised involving the investment in Terminal 3, and hence have requested for the following:\n\n\u25cf A letter from the undersigned which could be read in their shareholder's meeting, assuring their shareholders that the Government will continue to assist Fraport in its investment in the Philippines. A copy of the letter of the undersigned dated 19 June 2002 is attached as Annex 2.\n\n\u25cf A call from Executive Secretary Alberto G. Romulo to Fraport's Chairman Roland Koch informing him that a new DOTC Secretary has been appointed, but despite said appointment, all matters concerning NAIA Terminal 3 should be referred to the undersigned.\n\n6. On international political matters, Fraport's representatives informed us that should Fraport be constrained to write off its investment in PIATCO, information on the scandal will be made worldwide to cause detrimental political repercussions on the current administration. Fraport also wanted to convey to Her Excellency their desire to deal on all matters regarding the Project with the undersigned.\n\n7. On domestic political matters, the undersigned is of the opinion that to allow her reports to be made public or subject to congressional scrutiny at this point in time would be inappropriate, premature and would impede the ongoing negotiations with Fraport, which is to continue beginning 01 July 2002. It is therefore requested that all her reports on this Project be classified as Top Secret in accordance with memorandum Circular No. 78, series of 1964, as amended by Memorandum Circular No. 196, series of 1964, or such classification as Her Excellency may deem appropriate.\n\n8. The undersigned has made it very clear to Fraport that the final deadline for the conclusion of the negotiations should be on 10 July 2002 to give the President and Congress time to review and approve the final revised agreement.\"\n\n176.\n\nConcurrently, Fraport in its Interim Report to Shareholders as at 30 June 2002, wrote:\n\n\"Our current discussions with the Philippine government are aimed at establishing negotiating positions for PIATCO. A major aspect continues to be the concession agreement made between PIATCO and a previous government. Our most important objective is to limit the changes to this agreement sought by the Philippine government in order to obtain a customary market return from the BOT project. Achievement of this objective is a pre-condition for our continued involvement in Manila. More recently, we have also discussed with the government alternatives to the present project structure. For us, one alternative is a transfer of the project from PIATCO back to the Philippine state. In this case, Fraport would aim to recover the amounts invested and ensure a professional operation of the terminal as part of a management agreement to be made between a future operator and the government. This alternative also requires the Philippine government to buy the terminal for a reasonable price which is acceptable to PIATCO and its shareholders and that the conditions set out in the management agreement are in line with international standards.\n\nFollowing our decision to provide no further financing, PIATCO has substantially used up its available liquid funds. PIATCO is currently trying to obtain additional financing. However, Fraport does not consider the current state of the negotiations far enough advanced to provide further liquid funds.\n\nDue to the financial constraints at PIATCO, in contrast to the original plan there are not enough personnel hired to operate the terminal, which makes adequate training by the end of November 2002 questionable. The start of operations will thus probably also be delayed for this reason. Despite these difficulties, construction of the terminal will be substantially completed in August 2002.\n\nDespite the slow progress of discussions over the past few months, Fraport continues to assume that it will be possible to continue the Manila project successfully. This requires that current discussions will be successful. Otherwise, risks could arise which could lead to considerable negative effects on the results for 2002.\"\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Fraport's auditors, KPMG, subsequently issued Fraport's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2001. KPMG's Audit Report included Fraport's Management Report which set forth an account of the negotiations with the Government in 2002. Fraport disclosed to its shareholders that a t60 million write-down had been made. Fraport's explanation for this write-down is detailed as follows:\n\n\"[B]y the date of the 2001 balance sheet, the financial exposure to this project - through equity interests, loans and other receivables amount to t 234.7 million, plus the securities provided, namely: t 26.3 million to the general contractor of the construction work, t 118.3 million to banks in connection with bridge loans and to the group of banks which is to provide the long-term financing, as well as a t 22.7 million contribution to the increase of PIATCO's equity by US$ 70 million - was much greater than the influence in terms of corporate law. After the 2001 balance sheet date, additional securities amounting to t 38.7 million were provided.\n\nThis disproportionate financing exposure of Fraport AG to the Manila project was caused by the necessity to obtain interim financing for the terminal construction and by the inability of the fellow shareholders to contribute to this interim financing. True, on July 27, 2001, the longterm financing was concluded with an international group of banks led by the Asian Development Bank, the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, and the International Finance Corporation, but in order for this financing to be disbursed, various conditions must have been fulfilled, which up to now is not the case, and their fulfillment depends to a large extent on decisions and declarations of intent of the Philippine government and its agencies. For this reason, mainly in the past few weeks, the Executive Board and other executives of Fraport AG had numerous talks with members of the government and their advisors, with government agencies and business partners, in order to create the conditions for disbursement of the loans. By the end of our audit, Fraport AG had not yet succeeded in this, but based on the progress of these talks up to now, especially after involvement of a special representative of the Philippine President, the Executive Board is confident that they will continue the Manila project, provided the BOT project achieves an acceptable profitability and the Fraport AG Supervisory Board releases the additional funds to cover PIATCO's short-term financing need amounting to US$ 80 million (roughly t 90.7 million).\n\nFrom today's perspective, it seems inevitable that the project will be much less profitable that initially planned, which is reflected in the Executive Board's risk assessment of the Manila project. Even though a concession agreement was entered into with the previous Philippine government, the present government attempts to re-negotiate \u2014 for instance, the amount of the concession fees - so that by now there is the 5\\* amendment of the concession agreement. The Manila project is accompanied by allegations of corruption against members of the government, employees of government agencies, and Fraport AG's Philippine business partners, and by investigations of PIATCO because of the exclusive concession for ground transportation services. Final decisions on factors crucial for the project's profitability, such as, for instance, the move of Philippine airline PAL into the new terminal are still outstanding. The present estimate of the duty free revenue is far below the assumptions made when Fraport AG joined the project. In addition, after a January 2002 expert opinion of the Halcrow Group Ltd., London, the forecast of the traffic volume had to be reduced, reflecting among other things, the business climate after the September 11 terrorist attacks and the weakness of economic activity in East Asia.\n\nUp to now, the delays in disbursing the loans of the long-term financing have created severe liquidity squeezes for PIATCO. The construction company threatened to stop the work if PIATCO does not meet its payment obligations according to contract. Since the project partners are not willing or able to make a greater contribution to the interim financing, up to now all these loans were made available by Fraport AG. Until disbursement of the long-term loans, PIATCO will need additional loans to prevent its insolvency, which would mean for Fraport AG the loss of all the investments it has made up to now.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2001, the Executive Board had to assess the total exposure to Manila and the related risks. Against the background of the good progress of construction and the - in the Board's view - constructive talks with the Philippine government and its advisors, on the one hand, and the numerous unresolved problems, on the other hand, the financial investments related to the Manila project were written down by nearly t 60 million, so that total investments of t 234.7 million were written down by a total of t 67.7 million including the previous year's adjustments, i.e. by 28.8 % of the gross value of the assets.\"\n\n**3. Secretary Climaco's \"Null and Void\" Assessment**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nIn early September 2002, during the on-going discussions regarding a potential takeover plan with Fraport, President Macapagal-Arroyo directed a seven-member interagency Cabinet Review Committee to look into the various issues raised by the Terminal 3 project. In this connection, Secretary Climaco submitted to the Cabinet Review Committee, on 10 September 2002, a \"Chronology Y Assessment of the NAIA Terminal 3 Project\" outlined by reference to (i) background, (ii) commercial assessment, (iii) legal assessment, and (iv) proposed directions. In terms of \"commercial assessment\", Secretary Climaco stated that the \"Project will not survive under original bid terms\". In terms of legal assessment, Secretary Climaco concluded *inter alia:* \"[m]ust get court to declare contract is void\". The directions suggested by Secretary Climaco were:\n\n\"A. DOX/OGCC Opinion saying award Y contracts are void\n\nB. Declaration of nullity\n\nC. Negotiate on mutual termination/amicable settlement\n\nD. Possible options to Government\"\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, while Secretary Climaco had concluded that court nullification of the concession agreements was one of the Government's options, the Cabinet Review Committee was still recommending negotiations with PIATCO in line with Fraport's takeover proposal. Indeed, on 25 September 2002, the Cabinet Review Committee recommended the following to the President:\n\n\"1. Her Excellency directed on 09 September 2002 a seven-member interagency Cabinet Review Committee (hereinafter, \"Review Committee\") to look into various issues that have been raised about the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) International Passenger Terminal (IPT) 3 build-operate-transfer (BOT) project, and to assess the Fraport offer conveyed by Roland Koch. The Review Committee was tasked to recommend alternative courses of action to the President within two weeks.\n\n2. The Review Committee is composed of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) as chairman, and the following agencies as members: Department of Justice (DOX), Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Tourism (DOT) and Office of the Presidential Adviser for Strategic Projects (OPASP).\n\n25. The Review Committee took into consideration the concern that, as a matter of public interest, the timely completion of Terminal 3 must be pursued.\n\n26. The Review Committee agreed to recommend to Her Excellency the following courses of action:\n\na. The President to designate the negotiating team composed of DOTC as lead negotiator, the DOX, and M1AA. The NEDA and other agencies may be called upon for assistance. The negotiating team shall initiate informal consultations with PIATCO pending the clarification on the legal position of the government. In relation to this, the DOX pointed out the \"separability principle\" in dealing with any legal infirmity in the contract. An interpretation that could be adopted is that if any of the provisions in the contract were found void, it would not necessarily nullify the contract. It could be instead be a point for renegotiation.\n\nb. The legal agencies of the government, composed of DOX (as head), OGCC, and, OSG to be instructed by Her Excellency to formulate the legal position of the Executive particularly in response to the contract nullification lawsuit filed before the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, all officers of the executive department shall be enjoined to refrain from making any public pronouncements through any media regarding *sub judice* matters pertaining to the suit.\n\nc. Once the legal position of the Executive has been formulated, DOTC, MIAA, and DOX may start the formal negotiations with PIATCO.\"\n\n180.\n\nOn 30 September 2002, five days after the Cabinet Review Committee's recommendation for \"formal negotiations with PIATCO\", Secretary Climaco wrote to President Macapagal-Arroyo recommending \"that the Government proceed with obtaining a declaration of nullity\" of the concession agreement. With her letter of 30 September 2002, Secretary Climaco attached her Memorandum to the Senate Committee on Accountability of Public Officers and Investigations (\"Blue Ribbon Committee\") on the NAIA International Passenger Terminal 3 project. Secretary Climaco had determined that the concession arrangements were null and void and could accordingly not be renegotiated. She stated and recommended very clearly:\n\n\"Being null and void, these agreements cannot be re-negotiated. Novations are void if the original obligations are void. Further, void contracts cannot be ratified, nor does the action or defense for the declaration of their inexistence prescribe. Neither can the Government be held in estoppel for the mistakes or errors on the part of its officials or agents, nor the erroneous application and enforcement of the law by public officers.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that the Government proceed with obtaining a declaration of nullity of the above agreements. Parallel thereto, the Government must determine whether PIATCO was a builder in bad faith or a builder in good faith in order to ascertain whether the structures constructed on Government land should be acquired. Should the Government determine that PIATCO is a builder in good faith, and should the Government deem it feasible to acquire the structures built on its property, then it may consider the offer of Fraport AG in its letter dated 06 August 2002.\"\n\n181.\n\nOn 2 October 2002, Secretary Climaco also transmitted a copy of her Memorandum to Secretary Dante B. Canlas, then Director General of the National Economic Development Authority. In her transmittal letter, she wrote:\n\n\"Pursuant to the undersigned's membership in the committee created by Her Excellency President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to review the NAIA Terminal 3 Project and the proposal of Fraport AG in its letter dated 06 August 2002, the undersigned is transmitting herewith, to yourself and to all the members of said committee and others concerned, a copy of the undersigned's memorandum to the Senate Committee on Accountability of Public Officers and Investigations (Blue Ribbon Committee) dated 26 September 2002.\n\nBased on a review of the Project, the following conclusions may be made:\n\n*First,* the award of the Project to Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc. (PIATCO) [t]hen a joint venture composed of People's Air Cargo Y Warehousing Co., Inc. (Paircargo), Philippine Air *[sic] Y* Ground Services, Inc. (PAGS), and Security Banking Corporation] was void, since the joint venture did not possess the financial prequalification requirements at the time the bidding was conducted. The provisions of the General Banking Act which restricted the equity investment of Security Bank in a non-allied undertaking to not more than 15% of Security Bank's net worth could not be overlooked nor waived by the Prequalification Bids Y Awards Committee (PBAC).\n\nThe BOT Law was violated when the unsolicited proponent was required to match the bid on an entity not prequalified. Further, the unsolicited proponent was not provided with an opportunity to match the bid due to a mis-application by the PBAC of the 1994 Implementing Rules Y Regulations (IRR) of the BOT Law.\n\n*Second,* the 1997 Concession Agreement executed between the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC)/Manila International Airport Authority (M1AA) and PIATCO on 12 July 1997 was null and void.\n\nWhile the sanctity of contracts is enshrined in the Civil Code, it is also a basic rule of law that contracts whose cause, object or purpose is contrary to public policy are inexistent and void from the beginning. These contracts cannot be novated nor ratified. Neither can the defense of their illegality be waived.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that contracts which require public bidding affect public interest. To alter these contracts without another public bidding runs counter to public policy, and makes the contract null and void. The Department of Justice (DOX) considers this good law as it continues to cite said rulings in the opinions which it renders.\n\nSince the 1997 Concession Agreement was altered in material respects, and was not subject to another public bidding, the 1997 Concession Agreement was null and void.\n\n*Third,* the 1998 Amended and Restated Concession Agreement (ARCA) executed between DOTC/MIAA and PIATCO on 26 November 1998 is likewise void for being contrary to public policy, applying the Supreme Court rulings which even the DOX cites.\n\nIn addition, the ARCA, constitutes a novation of the 1997 Concession Agreement, and a novation is void if the original obligation is void.\n\n*Fourth,* the 1999 First Supplement, 2000 Second Supplement, and 2001 Third Supplement are likewise invalid and void. They are invalid pursuant to the 1999 IRR of the BOT Law for not having been approved by the NEDA-ICC prior to execution and implementation. They are likewise void, applying the principles laid down by the Supreme Court.\n\n*Fifth,* the Government is not precluded from having the above contracts declared null and void. It is hornbook law that the principle of estoppel does not operate against the Government for the acts of its agents. Nor is it estopped by mistake or error on the part of its officials or agents. The erroneous application and enforcement of the law by public officers does not prevent a subsequent correct application of the statute.\n\n*Sixth,* the Constitutional provision on non-impairment of contracts does not apply in this instance since, pursuant to the rulings of the Supreme Court, the provision applies only to contracts legally-executed. Since the above contracts did not comply with the requisite public bidding, then legally-speaking, there is no contract abrogated because the contract was void and inexistent.\n\nThe undersigned hopes that the attached Memorandum, which discusses each of the above points in great depth, will be of assistance to her fellow Cabinet members in their review of the Project.\n\nMoving forward, after the determination of the legal status of the Project, the undersigned suggests that a declaration of nullity for the above contracts be obtained. Thereafter, our committee should determine whether PIATCO was a builder in good faith or a builder in bad faith. Parallel thereto, we must determine whether it is feasible for the Government to acquire the structure built on its property. Should this be the case, then the Fraport proposal contained in its letter of 06 August 2002 may be considered.\n\nThe undersigned looks forward to working with the committee at the earliest time possible.\"\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that notwithstanding Secretary Climaco's conclusions regarding the illegality of the concession arrangements, it was reported at that time in the media that President Macapagal-Arroyo had ordered the \"soft opening\" of Terminal 3 for 15 December 2002. On 10 October 2002, Secretary Climaco wrote to Executive Secretary Romulo and Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Cruz to express her disagreement in this regard and concluding that \"the statement has caused confusion and directly and indirectly pre-empted and prejudiced Government's position\". She wrote:\n\n1. Soft Opening - The statement of Press Secretary Ignacio R. Bunye that Her Excellency President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has ordered the soft opening of Terminal 3 on December 15, 2002, which was printed in daily newspapers starting 03 October 2002, has resulted in effects deleterious to the Government, which could have been prevented had that statement not been made.\n\n*First,* the term 'soft opening' is being equated with 'In-Service Date' which, as will be explained below, is being used by the Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc. (PIATCO) to compel Government to comply with stipulations favorable to PIATCO and to compel the airlines to transfer to Terminal 3 despite it being untested for operational readiness. With the In-Service Date declared in their favor, PIATCO effectively holds a Sword of Damocles over Government as it has been preparing to call Government in default, given the excessive Liquidated Damages Government has to pay after In-Service Date.\n\n*Second,* the Executive Branch is widely perceived to have foregone studying the legality of the contracts involving Terminal 3 since the signal from the Palace is to open the terminal even before any finding is made, and to prematurely re-negotiate the onerous provisions of the contracts. This has been reinforced by the statements of NEDA Director-General Dante B. Canlas, as printed in the October 8, 2002 issue of Business World, page 11 (copy attached), despite his self same Memorandum to the President dated 25 September 2002 enjoining all members of the Cabinet, the Presidential Review Committee, and their subordinates from issuing statement on the matter because this controversy is *subjudice.*\n\n*Third,* the Senate Committee on Accountability of Public Officers and Investigations (Blue Ribbon Committee) is due to render its report on the legality of the contracts of the Project, and this apparent eagerness to open Terminal 3 from the Executive Branch does not further Government's interest, given the lengthy discussions on the onerous and apparent illegal provisions of the Project agreements in the Blue Ribbon Committee hearing, which Sec. Canlas is privy to.\n\n*Fourth,* this has prompted the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation to conduct a hearing on 09 October 2002, effectively criticizing the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), Air Transportation Office (ATO), and Philippine Economic hone Authority (PEhA) for not cooperating with PIATCO. We have been informed that members of the House Committee were reprimanding MIAA and ATO for not acceding to PIATCO's requests which would lead to the opening of Terminal 3 on December 16, 2002. We were also informed that PEhA was criticized for not fully granting PIATCO the tax exemptions it claims are due to it.\n\nIn sum, the statement has caused confusion and directly and indirectly pre-empted and prejudiced Government's position. It is therefore strongly recommended that this statement, if not be retracted, be clarified to refer to a blessing, a site visit, or similar activity NOT EQUIVALENT TO IN-SERVICE DATE.\n\nThe undersigned is in favor of opening Terminal 3, but only:\n\n\u25cf Under legal terms acceptable to and favorable to the Government, unlike the terms of the Project agreements as they stand;\n\n\u25cf Once Terminal 3 is certified by independent appraisers to be structurally-sound and operational under international standards;\n\n\u25cf When the requirements of the airlines and MIAA employees are addressed; and\n\n\u25cf If its operations do not pose a security risk, given international standards.\"\n\n**4. Secretary Climaco's Appearance before the Senate \"Blue Ribbon Committee\"**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nAs noted earlier, in the period during which discussions involving Fraport, PIATCO and Secretary Climaco were being held, a Philippine Senate Blue Ribbon Committee was conducting hearings as part of an investigation instituted in response to a resolution filed in late 2001 by three senators calling for the investigation of the alleged \"grossly anomalous agreement entered into by the Republic of the Philippines and PIATCO involving the construction, operation and maintenance of the NAIA T3 [Terminal 3 project]\". The resolution was referred to three Senate Committees, which jointly conducted an investigation. The Blue Ribbon Committee heard witnesses.\n\n184.\n\nIn August and September 2002, Secretary Climaco appeared before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee and testified that the concession contracts should be declared null and void. This appears to be the first time that Secretary Climaco took the position that the contracts which she had been busy re-negotiating were null and void. More particularly, Secretary Climaco testified that, after reviewing the Terminal 3 concession arrangements, she had presented to President Macapagal-Arroyo two options: (1) to declare the agreements null and void; or (2) to renegotiate the contract. She informed the Committee that her effort to renegotiate the contract had failed. Secretary Climaco also addressed what she alleged had been corruption by the Cheng family in connection with the Terminal 3 project, stating unequivocally that she had information that PIATCO's controlling shareholder took \"kickbacks\" and received \"under-the-table\" payments.\n\n185.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, on 26 September 2002, at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, Secretary Climaco provided an extensive Memorandum (\"Climaco Memorandum\") in which she advocated that all five of the project contracts, and the award of the concession to PIATCO, be declared null and void.\n\n186.\n\nMore particularly, in her Memorandum, Secretary Climaco expressly stated that there would be severe negative financial consequences for both the Government and PAL if the Concession Agreement was performed and its invalidation and nullification not obtained. According to the Climaco Memorandum, \"[t]he financial and operational issues of NAIA Terminals 1, 2 and 3 and the proposed international cargo terminal must be rationalized\". The Climaco Memorandum explained as follows:\n\n\"It appears that when the Project was accepted as an unsolicited proposal, a study on the financial impact thereof to MIAA's capacity to absorb the financial impact of the requirements for Terminals 1 and 2 was not made. Neither was the impact of the proposed construction of an international cargo terminal on the site currently occupied by Nayong Pilipino conducted.\"\n\n187.\n\nThe Climaco Memorandum referred to PAL's expressed desire to continue to operate its domestic and international operations on a consolidated basis and concluded as follows:\n\n\"In any event, if PAL's requests will be accommodated, this will result in:\n\n1. The under-utilization and loss of revenues for Terminal 2, should PAL's integrated operations be moved to Terminal 3. This will result in MIAA's inability to pay the JICA loan for Terminal 2.\n\nIn the alternative, should PAL's integrated operations be retained in Terminal 2, then the Government may be called in default for not transferring all international passenger terminal operations to Terminal 3 upon In-Service Date.\n\n2. If PAL's integrated operations will be transferred to Terminal 3, PIATCO will have to construct and *[sic]* extension of Terminal 3 to be used for domestic flights, which shall cost around US$15M.\"\n\n188.\n\nThe Climaco Memorandum further emphasized that, whether in Terminal 2 or Terminal 3, PAL would want \"to be permitted to enjoy privileges/exemptions which it is now enjoying in Terminal 2\". It also expressly stated that PAL's relocation to Terminal 3 would have negative financial consequences for the Government as well. According to the Climaco Memorandum, Terminal 2 was \"now operating at a loss because of low traffic volume, low domestic passenger terminal fee, and non-payment of fees by some end users\", giving the Government, as creditor to the Japanese lenders of Terminal 2, concern about the additional negative revenue consequence of a PAL move to Terminal 3. The Climaco Memorandum explained:\n\n\"If Philippine Airlines, which currently uses Terminal 2 as it hub for its domestic and international operations, transfers to Terminal 3 on In-Service Date, the loss of revenue will greatly impact upon the ability of MIAA to service its loan for Terminal 2 to JICA. It should be noted that payments for the principal to JICA are due beginning 2003, and this amounts to approximately P700M.\"\n\n189.\n\nUltimately, after seven separate hearings and testimony by witnesses representing, *inter alia,* PIATCO and Fraport, the Blue Ribbon Committee issued its Report on 10 December 2002. The report concluded that: (1) the PIATCO contracts are intrinsically void because the required six signatures of the ICC members were not obtained; (2) the contracts were also void because there were substantial deviations from the Bid Documents; (3) the contracts contained onerous and disadvantageous provisions contrary to public policy and to the BOT Law; (4) the payment to Alfonso Liongson for buying favours from the Government was condemned; (5) the contract provides for a direct government guarantee which is prohibited by the BOT Law; and (6) the condition of the terminal facility raised serious security concerns. The Committee recommended the investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the violation of laws and irregularities at issue.\n\n**5. President Macapagal-Arroyo's Declaration That Her Government Would Not Honour the Terminal 3 Contracts**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nA few days prior to the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee's Report, President Macapagal-Arroyo delivered a public condemnation of the Terminal 3 project and PIATCO. These remarks were made on 29 November 2002 before a group of Filipino exporters in the Ceremonial Hall at Malacanang Palace during the 16 Annual \"Golden Shell Awards\". In her speech, the President raised the \"PIATCO issue\" as a disreputable example of the hold of \"vested interest\" on the Philippine State. After recognizing the importance of PIATCO's concession to build a world-class airport for international travelers, the President stated that \"the Solicitor General and the Justice Department have determined that all five agreements covering the NAIA Terminal 3, most of which were contracted in the previous administration, are null and void\".\n\n191.\n\nThe President then said that the contracts would henceforth not be honoured and declared: \"I cannot honour contracts which the Executive Branch's legal offices have concluded are null and void.\" The Tribunal notes that these remarks were delivered ten days before oral argument in the Supreme Court in the cases brought by petitioners identified with PAL to prevent the opening of Terminal 3.\n\n192.\n\nThe President declared that there had been illegality during the procurement and subsequent negotiations of the Concession Agreement, the ARCA, and its supplements. She stated that the PIATCO concession was \"emerging as a test-case\" of her administration's \"commitment to fight corruption\" and \"to free the state from the hold of any vested interest\". She added that she was ordering \"the Department of Justice and the PAGC (Presidential Anti-Graft Commission) to investigate any anomalies and prosecute all those found culpable in connection with the NAIA contract\". The following day, on 30 November 2002, the President reiterated her declaration in another speech and said that the \"Solicitor General has submitted to the Supreme Court the government position that all five agreements covering NAIA 3 are null and void\".\n\n193.\n\nOn 28 November 2002, *i.e.* the day before President Macapagal-Arroyo publicly declared that the Terminal 3 concession agreements would not be honoured, the Department of Justice had concluded in a memorandum addressed to the Executive Secretary that the concession agreements were null and void, mainly because they contained material deviations from the Bid Documents and the draft Concession Agreement.\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this memorandum is strikingly different from the Department of Xustice's prior written advice to the President on 21 May 2002 that had identified several provisions of the ARCA which \"may be possible subjects of renegotiation\" but neither stated that the ARCA was null and void nor questioned the validity of the original Concession Agreement.\n\n195.\n\nThe conclusion in this memorandum is also diametrically different from \"Contract Review No. 434\" dated 30 September 2002, in which the Office of the Government's Corporate Counsel concluded that the concession arrangements were valid, and added that \"[r]ecords attest to the fact that the negotiation, drafting, execution and signing of the Concession Agreement were strictly in accordance with Republic Act No. 6957, as amended by Republic Act No. 7718 k(the BOT Law)l and its Implementing Rules and Regulations\". Accordingly, the Office of the Government's Corporate Counsel recommended that \"[s]ubject to the regulatory powers of the government through MIAA, the parties continue with the implementation of the contract but in the process the onerous provisions thereof, if any, be negotiated/re-negotiated\".\n\n196.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that as part of President Macapagal-Arroyo's speech on 30 November 2002, she expressly addressed the shareholders involved in the Terminal 3 project: \"Let me, however, assure the shareholders: Your legitimate claims will be honored to the last peso and the Terminal will open early next year.\" On 4 December 2002, Fraport wrote to the Government seeking a written confirmation along the same lines:\n\n\"Now we are at a critical junction. We need for internal reasons and in particular for auditors, a written confirmation along the lines that President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo announced publicly.\n\nThe key point is, Fraport can only continue to negotiate with Government and continue the same supportive level if a written confirmation is given to us that under Philippine Law, our investment is acknowledged and protected. Therefore, it is urgent that we have someone we can deal with to achieve the goal.\"\n\n**6. Fraport's Continued Efforts to Find a Solution**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nOn 12 December 2002, Mr. Henkel met with representatives of the Government including Executive Secretary Romulo and Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Cruz. During this meeting, Fraport expressed its concern regarding the \"turn of events\". The minutes of the meeting reveal the following:\n\n\"1. Mr. Lauk stated that Fraport was now very concerned with the turn of events. The Department of Justice rendered an opinion saying that the PIATCO concession agreements were void. Her Excellency President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo delivered a speech quoting said opinion, and that of the Solicitor General, and said that she could not enforce a void contract. The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee had rendered Senate Report No. 130 which, among others, stated that the concession agreements of PIATCO were void. Further, third parties have initiated proceedings before the Supreme Court to confirm that PIATCO's concession agreements are void.\n\n2. Fraport believes that the Chengs were the ones who originated the problems PIATCO now faces. Fraport is nonetheless bound to the Chengs as fellow-shareholders in PIATCO. Mr. Lauk stated that Fraport will be coming out with a press release soon stating these matters.\n\n3. Given the above, Fraport seeks assurance from the Philippine Government that Fraport, as the primary funder of Terminal 3, will receive compensation.\n\n4. Secretary Cruz stated that President Arroyo stated in her speech that all legitimate claims shall be paid to the last centavo, provided the same are legitimate and valid. The Solicitor General likewise mentioned the same in its pleading before the Supreme Court.\n\n5. Mr. Lauk requested for Executive Secretary Romulo's indulgence that he speak with Fraport Chair Roland Koch to inform him of what President Arroyo and the Solicitor General had said. Mr. Lauk also requested that these be reduced to a letter which Fraport can show to its shareholders and other interested parties, such as Fraport's auditors who are currently in the process of auditing the books of Fraport. Fraport's auditors are considering a total write-off of the amounts infused by Fraport into the NAIA Terminal 3 project. Mr. Lauk said that if that is done, then Fraport can no longer join hands with the government, which has been his recommendation.\n\n6. Executive Secretary Romulo replied that these requests shall be given due consideration.\n\n7. Secretary Cruz reiterated that Philippine laws amply protect local and foreign investors provided their claims are legitimate and valid.\"\n\n198.\n\nOn 27 December 2002, Secretary Romulo wrote to Fraport. Some of the extracts from this letter are quoted at length since they are not irrelevant to the aftermath of the Tribunal's decision in respect of jurisdiction:\n\n\"This refers to your letter to Her Excellency President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo dated December 18, 2002.\n\nPhilippine laws protect legitimate investments and arm's length transactions.\n\nAccordingly, Her Excellency President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, during her speech for the Bonifacio Day Celebration on November 30, 2002, assured the stakeholders that 'your legitimate claims will be honored to the last peso'. Her statement was reiterated by Solicitor General Alfredo L. Benipayo in a Supplemental Comment dated December 9, 2002 filed before the Supreme Court wherein it was stated: 'To disabuse PIATCO of its apprehension that a government takeover will send a wrong signal to foreign investors, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has made it plain in a speech on November 30, 2002 that 'legitimate claims of stakeholders in PIATCO will be honored to the last peso'.\n\nDuring our meeting on December 11, 2002, Secretary Avelino X. Cruz and I reiterated that all legitimate investments shall be protected and honoured in accordance with the Philippine Constitution and laws.\n\nRest assured that our Administration intends to implement fairly and justly the law as the Constitution mandates.\"\n\n199.\n\nNotwithstanding these assurances, there were no discussions between Fraport and the Government. On 17 January 2003, Mr. Henkel wrote to Executive Secretary Romulo to express Fraport's disappointment:\n\n\"With disappointment I have noted that, despite several attempts through various channels, it was not possible to get any appointment with your goodself or with any other representative of the Philippine Government who is responsible for the NAIA IPT 3 Project during my stay in Manila from 7 January 2003 through 17 January 2003. Unfortunately I have to travel back to Germany on 18 January 2003 to report the status of the NAIA IPT 3 Project to my Board.\n\nBearing in mind that the discussions with the Philippine Government on several open issues on this ambitious Project have now been pursued for more than one year, and that a world class and state of the art terminal has been materially completed and ready for operations since December 2002, but despite of this is not allowed to enter into operations and earn revenues for an unforeseeable period, we believe that the present status of the Project leads to a tremendous waste of resources and unnecessary costs and risks.\n\nWe therefore urgently request you that the talks about the future of our investment are resumed as soon as possible, and I am pleased to assure you that I will be available again, together with my team, here in Manila from 27 January 2003 to meet with your goodself or any other duly authorized representative of your Government who is responsible for this Project.\n\nPlease allow me to suggest that a final solution for the various pending issues should be achieved until the mid of February of 2003.\"\n\n200.\n\nOn 10 February 2003, Mr. Henkel again wrote to Executive Secretary Romulo reiterating Fraport's request for an amicable settlement:\n\n\"We hereby reiterate our appeal to the Philippine Government to finally come to an expeditious solution for our investment in the NAIA IPT 3 Project either through an economically viable concession or through an amicable settlement.\n\nBased on the bilateral Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between your Country and the Federal Republic of Germany, we repeat our numerous requests for a counterpart to seriously and actively discuss a mutually acceptable solution on the future of our investment in the Philippines.\n\nWith disappointment we have noted that we have neither received any reply to our letter dated January 17, 2003 nor have we been advised of who is the duly authorized representative of the Philippine Government for discussions with us about our investment. We would be grateful if such nomination could be notified to us by February 13, 2003, and it should be our joint goal to reach an agreement in principle, subject to further detailed negotiations, by February 28, 2003.\n\nWithout feedback from Government's side, we have no other recourse but to initiate the commencement of arbitration proceedings before World Bank in Washington D.C. in order to protect our investments in the event that no agreement in principle has been reached by February 28, 2003.\"\n\n201.\n\nBy letter dated 14 February 2003, Fraport repeated its desire to settle the issue amicably through negotiations and stated its position as follows:\n\n\"Please understand that it is completely unacceptable for Fraport if Fraport's investment is questioned only after the NAIA International Passenger Terminal 3 Project has been almost completed, and the government has received benefits under the relevant agreements without raising any objections, and without assurance that Fraport shall receive compensation in accordance with the Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of the Philippines for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments ('Bilateral Investment Treaty') in the event the concession agreements are deemed by your national courts to be null and void as announced by your government.\"\n\n202.\n\nOn 18 March 2003, Dr. Wilhelm Bender, Fraport's CEO, wrote to Secretary Cruz in his capacity as Chief Legal Counsel of the Office of the President:\n\n\"Over the last week, the Executive and the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG had the impression that a mutually acceptable solution for the problems of the NAIA IPT 3 Project had been agreed upon in principle. This impression was confirmed by the conversations between Executive Secretary Romulo and Prime Minister Koch. It was confirmed that the Government of the Republic of the Philippines is willing to cooperate to come to an amicable settlement, which would secure Fraport's investments in the Philippines.\n\nOn this basis, and with the explicit support of our shareholders, I decided to come personally to Manila to discuss with the authorized representatives of the Philippine Government the major issues to come to an acceptable solution. It was always very clear to me from our previous discussions with the Philippine Government that you sought a solution involving an exit for Fraport and thereby securing the value of the NAIA IPT 3 Project, in which we invested in good faith.\n\nIt is evident that such solution has to recognize the value of our commitment either through the economic viability of the Project or through a fair compensation of Fraport in the amount of at least 300 Mio. USD. The draft memorandum of understanding distributed to us and discussed with Secretary Tan Climaco still has significant gaps and unresolved critical issues.\n\nHowever, we would be very pleased to continue fruitful negotiations with the Philippine Government, in which the following key issues should be addressed:\n\n\u25cf Minimum compensation for Fraport's investment in 2003   \nWe would be willing to receive a compensation which is determined by an internationally renowned auditor, which both sides agree upon. Based on the size of our investment, we expect that this will result in a compensation to Fraport not less than 300 Mio. USD.\n\n\u25cf Appropriate financing terms and conditions  \n We could agree to a financing agreement reflecting market conditions, which will not result in further write-off for Fraport upon the determination of the value of the project on market conditions.\n\nAccording to the requirements of German law, we could sign such an agreement immediately to take effect after approval by the Supervisory Board of Fraport AG.\"\n\n203.\n\nOn the same day, Dr. Bender also wrote to President Macapagal-Arroyo requesting a meeting with her and indicating that he was \"optimistic that we will be signing an agreement with your Government on a mutually beneficial solution within the next day\".\n\n204.\n\nOn 25 March 2003, Secretary Climaco responded to Fraport's letter of 18 March 2003. She wrote:\n\n\"It was pursuant to the numerous requests of Fraport and its claim that it has a proposed amicable solution which prompted the undersigned to meet with its representatives. The following communications may be referred to: the letter of Mr. Peter Henkel to Executive Secretary Alberto G. Romulo dated 17 January 2003; the facsimile transmission of Mr. Henkel to Executive Secretary Romulo dated 03 March 2003; and the facsimile transmission of Mr. Henkel to the undersigned dated 06 March 2003. Copies of these are attached for immediate reference.\n\nFraport likewise requested for meetings through diplomatic channels. Accordingly, the undersigned met with German Ambassador to the Philippines Herbert D. Jess on 07 March 2003.\n\nIt was likewise these requests which prompted Executive Secretary Romulo to call your Mr. Roland Koch and inform him that the undersigned would meet with Fraport's representatives to listen to Fraport's proposed amicable solution.\n\nDuring the undersigned's meetings with Fraport, the undersigned emphasized that the issues on the validity of the award of the NAIA Terminal 3 Project to Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc. (PIATCO), and the five (5) contracts executed thereafter, have been submitted to the Philippine Supreme Court before any discussions could be commenced with PIATCO.\n\nNonetheless, since Fraport claimed that it had an amicable solution for all parties concerned, the undersigned met with your representatives. The undersigned reiterated in said meetings that any amicable solution should be made on the basis that the award of the Project to PIATCO, and the five (5) contracts executed thereafter, are null and void. This is the same premise which any negotiations with PIATCO was to be made. Further, Fraport's proposed solution should be in accordance with Philippine laws and further discussions on the issues on the Project should be with the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) headed by Secretary Leandro R. Mendoza, with the assistance of Solicitor General Alfredo L. Benipayo and Government Corporate Counsel Manuel A. X. Teehankoe.\n\nIn said meetings, Fraport informed the undersigned that it is in the process of purchasing its local partner's equity interest in PIATCO, and its proposed solution calls for an agreement between Fraport, PIATCO, and our Government. Fraport's proposal included the following principal terms: (1) the immediate delivery and turnover of ownership and physical possession of Terminal 3 by PIATCO to the Government; and (2) payment by the Government to PIATCO of an appropriate value for Terminal 3 to be determined by a reputable international auditing firm, subject to the verification and confirmation of the Commission on Audit.\n\nFraport's proposed terms also included: (1) a minimum guaranteed payment to Fraport for its financial exposure to the Project; and (2) a Technical Services Agreement (TSA) for the operation of Terminal 3.\n\nThe undersigned in her meetings with Fraport representatives has advised them that the minimum guaranteed payment to Fraport may not be allowed under Philippine laws. With respect to the TSA, that is an operational matter best addressed to DOTC Secretary Mendoza and the Manila International Airport Authority, subject to compliance with the Philippine procurement laws.\n\nIn addition, should PIATCO decide to dissolve its corporate existence, as your representatives have claimed, then the amounts which PIATCO possesses, under our laws, should first be used to pay its creditors. The balance, should there be any, is distributed to its shareholders. We are not privy to the credit agreements of PIATCO, and the shareholder agreements among its shareholders.\n\nThe above issues were emphasized by the undersigned in all of her meetings with Fraport. The undersigned trusts that the above narration is a faithful summary of what transpired in her discussions with Fraport and its representatives, and that the same clarifies some misunderstandings in the letter dated 18 March 2003.\"\n\n205.\n\nThis would turn out to be Secretary Climaco's last official letter to Fraport regarding the Terminal 3 project. In the end, when the takeover proposal became public, the Manila press presented the plan as evidence of government mismanagement and selfdealing. Secretary Climaco later denounced the takeover plan in testimony before the Senate and the plan was never implemented. In a subsequent press statement, President Macapagal-Arroyo declared:\n\n\"Even while the Government was taking the correct position that the concession contracts are null and void, negotiations with both PIATCO and Fraport were being conducted, to explore the possibility of avoiding protracted litigation [...]. Immediately upon assumption of my second term, I directed renewed efforts to arrive at a negotiated solution so that the terminal could be examined, and if it is safe, structurally sound, and conforms to international standards, open it in a way that adheres to law. Two new waves of effort were undertaken, but both failed, not because of any fault of Government, but due to deep reasons that prevent PIATCO and Fraport representatives from coming to a unified, reasonable position vis-a-vis the Republic. Those reasons are beyond the capability of the Republic to address and are internal to the two companies.\"\n\n206.\n\nIn his witness statement to the Tribunal, Fraport's CEO, Mr. Bender, states that as of this point, \"Fraport's management decided to write down the value of our investment to zero in accordance with German accounting requirements\". Mr. Bender's statement concludes:\n\n\"Because of the write-down, Fraport had an annual net loss of 121 million euros, and retained earnings were zero after a release from capital reserves. As a result, no dividend payments were made for fiscal year 2002. This was the first loss that Fraport had experienced since I joined the company in 1993.\"\n\n7. **The Philippine Supreme Court's Decision that the Terminal 3 Contracts Are Null and Void** ***Ab Iaitio***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nStarting in September 2002, several petitions for prohibition were filed with the Philippine Supreme Court against PIATCO and others. Under the Philippine Constitution, the Court has original jurisdiction over petitions for writs of prohibition. Rule 65, paragraph 2, of the Philippine Rules of Civil Procedure provides for use of the writ to restrain ministerial acts of a government agency, including the performance of public contracts, when such acts are without or in excess of authority or constitute grave abuses of discretion and when administrative appeal is unavailable or inadequate.\n\n208.\n\nIn case number G.R. No. 155001, filed on 17 September 2002, the petitioners4 were employees of international airline service providers operating at Terminals 1 and 2 who claimed that they stood to lose their employment upon the implementation of the Terminal 3 concession contracts. On 15 October 2002, employers of the petitioning workers filed a motion to intervene and a petition-in-intervention. In G.R. 155547, filed on 24 October 2002, Congressmen Salacnib Baterina, Clavel Martinez and Constantino Jaraula filed a similar petition. In G.R. 155661, filed on 6 November 2002, several employees of the MIAA also filed a petition for prohibition seeking to nullify the Terminal 3 concession contracts. On 11 December 2002, another group of Congressmen moved to intervene as Respondents-Interveners seeking to defend the validity of the concession agreements and seeking dismissal of the petitions.\n\nIncluding one Demosthenes Agan, Jr., hence the subsequent references to the *\"Agan* decision\"\n\n209.\n\nPIATCO filed comments in response to the petitions on 7 and 27 November 2002. PIATCO sought as relief a denial of the petitions with an award of costs.\n\n210.\n\nThe Office of the Solicitor General, on behalf of the public respondents, filed comments on November 11 and 18, 2002 seeking to have the contracts declared null and void, and filed a supplemental comment on 9 December 2002 reiterating its prayer and adding the argument that PIATCO had not been properly qualified. The Office of the Government Corporate Counsel filed comments on behalf of MIAA on 7 November. 2002, in which it requested that the ARCA and supplements, but not the 1997 Concession Agreement, be declared null and void.\n\n211.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral argument on the petitions from all parties to the proceedings, including PIATCO, on 10 December 2002. After the oral argument, the Court required the parties to file memoranda in amplification of the issues heard in oral argument within 30 days and ordered the parties to explore the possibility of mediation or arbitration. The Office of the Solicitor General, now joined by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel, filed a joint memorandum seeking a judgment from the Supreme Court declaring the 1997 Concession Agreement, the ARCA and the Supplements to the ARCA void as contrary to the Constitution, the BOT Law and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted that during the Supreme Court proceedings, the Solicitor General at first had urged that the original Concession Agreement be upheld, and that only certain provisions of the ARCA be struck down. Specifically, on 11 November 2002, then-newly appointed Solicitor General Benipayo filed a comment which was, with a few exceptions, a *verbatim* restatement of the fact section and other parts of the legal discussion of Secretary Climaco's Memorandum to the Blue Ribbon Committee. Solicitor General Benipayo's comment, unlike Secretary Climaco's Report, however, did not contest the validity of the Concession Agreement itself. Instead, it requested that the parties \"reinstate, and comply with the 1997 Concession Agreement, except as regards material deviations therein from the Bid Documents\".\n\n213.\n\nAs indicated earlier, on 18 November 2002, the Office of the Solicitor General also filed a comment in the *Agan* case. This comment was a major reversal of the Solicitor General's position a week earlier. The Solicitor General was now requesting that all PIATCO agreements be declared null and void, rather than having the original concession agreement reinstated, which he acknowledged \"in all candour\" to be a reversal of position. The 18 November comment, like the 11 November comment, restated *verbatim* the facts and some of the legal sections of Secretary Climaco's Memorandum. But for the first time, the Solicitor General argued that a basis for nullifying the concession agreements was the PIATCO group's failure to satisfy the bidding prequalification requirements.\n\n214.\n\nThe full reformulation of the Solicitor General's position came on 9 December 2002, a week after President Macapagal-Arroyo's public denunciation of PIATCO and the Terminal 3 project. The occasion was the supplemental comment in the *Baterina* case. The Solicitor General stated that \"Paircargo, PIATCO's predecessor, was not validly prequalified, and thus the award to PIATCO is void\", concluding that \"[c]learly, the award to PIATCO, and consequently, the PIATCO contracts are void\". Again, the supplemental comment constituted a mostly *verbatim* restatement of the relevant passages of Secretary Climaco's Memorandum to the Blue Ribbon Committee. Indeed, the supplemental comment reiterated, with very minor editing, pages 15 to 22 of Climaco's argument, according to which the award of the Terminal 3 concession and each of the concession agreements were considered void because the PIATCO group had lacked the requisite financial capability. The Solicitor General concluded that \"since the subject contracts are void, it follows that no irreparable injury will be suffered by PIATCO\" in the event of a government takeover of the Terminal, and PIATCO would not be entitled to argue that such a takeover would constitute a confiscation without due process and just compensation, because the \"facility is not the private property of PIATCO\".\n\n215.\n\nThe Philippine Supreme Court issued its decision on the Agan and related petitions on 5 May 20035. The Court first decided the question of standing, and determined that the airport employees and concessionaire petitioners had standing because they had a direct personal stake in the outcome of the proceeding. As for the public official petitioners, the Court determined that the case was of \"transcendental importance\" to the Philippine public and therefore supported a waiver of the technical requirements of standing, consistent, the Court said, with a longstanding and well-established line of Philippine precedents.\n\nG.R. No. 155001, G.R. No. 155547 and G.R. No. 155661.\n\n216.\n\nThe Court then determined to take the case as a matter of original jurisdiction under its Rule 65 writ of prohibition procedure because the facts essential to the decision were well-established, a speedy disposition was important, and the parties agreed that the petitions raised issues of transcendental importance.\n\n217.\n\nIn considering the merits of the issues raised by the petitions, the Court determined that serious violations of Philippine law and public policy in respect of several issues raised by the petitioners compelled it to conclude that the concession agreements in the Terminal 3 project were null and void *ab initio.* The Court considered the contention that the Terminal 3 project concessionaire (then the Paircargo consortium) had not been properly pre-qualified as financially able to undertake the contract because the PBAC had improperly factored into the net worth of the consortium the entire equity of Paircargo's partner, Security Bank, in disregard of the provisions of the Philippine Banking law that limited Security Bank's contribution to no more than 15% of its equity. The Court determined that it was erroneous to include all of Security Bank's equity, which was never available to Paircargo because of the restrictions of the Banking Law, in deciding the Paircargo consortium's net worth. Had the proper calculation been made prior to the award of the concession, it would have been evident that Paircargo did not qualify, because its equity would have amounted only to 6.08% of the project cost, instead of the 30% required. Because Paircargo was not a qualified bidder, the Court concluded that PBAC's award of the Terminal 3 concession contract to Paircargo was null and void.\n\n218.\n\nIn addition, among various other findings, the Court found that the 1997 Concession Agreement was \"entirely different\" from the draft Concession Agreement that had been bidded out, which \"directly translates concrete financial advantages to PIATCO that were previously not available during the bidding process\". Therefore the 1997 Concession Agreement was void as being contrary to public policy.\n\n**F. The Aftermath**\n--------------------\n\n219.\n\nAt the time of the Supreme Court's decision, Terminal 3 was almost fully built. In fact, after the Supreme Court's decision invalidating the PIATCO concession and related contracts, as was noted earlier, the Macapagal-Arroyo administration officials repeated assurances that Fraport would receive due compensation. One day after the Supreme Court's decision, the Philippine Finance Secretary said that investors in the Terminal 3 project would be justly compensated, stating that the \"issue of just compensation is one that is respected by this administration. I don't think there's any question of getting it for free. I don't think that's an issue.\" The next day, President Macapagal-Arroyo repeated that the investors would be \"justly compensated\". Moreover, President Macapagal-Arroyo instructed the Philippine Ambassador to Germany Minerva Jean Falcon to brief the German government on the options open to the Philippine government and to assure that Fraport would be treated fairly and equitably.\n\n220.\n\nFollowing the \"null and void\" decision of the Supreme Court, Fraport accordingly continued its discussions with the Government in order to obtain compensation. In June 2003, President Macapagal-Arroyo issued Administrative Order No. 75 establishing a Cabinet Oversight Committee to resolve the various outstanding issues with respect to Terminal 3. The Committee first met with Fraport in a joint session also attended by the other PIATCO shareholders. Committee Chairman Roxas refused to consider separate treatment for individual shareholders. He declared that if a solution could not be found which was satisfactory to all parties, he would recommend that the President dissolve the Oversight Committee. In response to Roxas' statement and in an effort to move the talks forward, the PIATCO shareholders agreed to and did in fact consolidate their requests for compensation. They also appointed a common representative to facilitate negotiations with the Government.\n\n221.\n\nHowever, by year-end 2003, the discussions between the Oversight Committee, on the one hand, and PIATCO and Fraport, on the other hand, had been postponed indefinitely. It is noted that during this period, PIATCO sought reconsideration before the Supreme Court of its decision in *Agan,* but PIATCO's motions were denied by a Resolution of the Supreme Court dated 21 January 2004. As of this point, the Supreme Court's decision in *Agan* became final. On 1 March 2004, in Administrative Order No. 96, President Macapagal-Arroyo dissolved the Oversight Committee. In the interim, on 17 September 2003, Fraport had submitted its Request for Arbitration to ICSID.\n\n222.\n\nShortly after Fraport's Request for Arbitration was registered by ICSID on 6 August 2004, Attorney F. Arthur L. Villaraza filed a criminal complaint for libel against two of Fraport's senior executives, Dr. Wilhem Bender and Dr. Manfred Scholch, as well as against two of Fraport's Philippine lawyers, Cesar Manalaysay and Edgardo Balois, alleging that the Request contained derogatory statements against him and his law firm.\n\n223.\n\nOn 19 September 2004, Secretary Climaco also filed a criminal complaint for libel against the same respondents alleging that Fraport's Request for Arbitration contained malicious and derogatory statements against her.\n\n224.\n\nAlthough these two complaints were dismissed in the spring of 2006, at the time of writing the present Award, the two complainants have sought leave to appeal these decisions. To the Tribunal's knowledge, these appeals are presently pending.\n\n225.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that following a lawsuit filed by Takenaka in London's High Court of Justice against PIATCO claiming substantial sums due pursuant to the EPC Contract for Terminal 3, it obtained a ruling in its favour for the unpaid amount of US$83 million under that agreement.\n\n**III. THE PHILIPPINE EXPROPRIATION PROCEEDINGS**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n226.\n\nAs the Tribunal noted earlier, after the Request for Arbitration had been registered by ICSID and the Tribunal constituted, and while the written phase of the instant arbitration was proceeding, the Republic of the Philippines, in December 2004, took possession of Terminal 3.\n\n227.\n\nAt the time of writing the present Award, the expropriation proceedings in the Philippines have not been concluded.\n\n**B. The Background to the Philippine Expropriation Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nIn December 2004, the Republic of the Philippines instituted court proceedings to take possession of Terminal 3. In a statement issued on 24 December 2004 titled \"NAIA Terminal 3 takeover\", President Macapagal-Arroyo explained the Respondent's action as follows:\n\n\"On Tuesday, December 21, 2004, I directed the Solicitor General to file the expropriation complaint to allow Government to acquire the NAIA Terminal 3. We are now in possession of the terminal, and after the necessary inventory and inspection to ensure the safety of the travelling public, we will take steps to complete and operate the Terminal as soon as possible. Public interest requires that the Government take all lawful measures to immediately provide for the increasing demands of international passenger traffic. I am concerned at the unmet need of our overseas Filipino workers, businessmen and tourists who are deprived of a modern, safe and convenient airport terminal.\n\nThe expropriation was undertaken only after all reasonable measures to arrive at a negotiated settlement broke down. In November 2002, I announced that after careful study it was my Government's view that the concession contracts to Terminal 3 were null and void ab initio. The position was upheld by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee in December, and by the Supreme Court in May of 2003. PIATCO moved to reconsider the decision by the Supreme Court twice, and both motions were rejected. The care shown by the three branches of Government, and our careful adherence to law and due process are underscored by the availability of remedies to PIATCO every step of the way. We could not have taken possession of the Terminal until the judgment of the Supreme Court became final in March 2004, at a time when the country was engrossed in the presidential electoral exercise.\n\nEven while the Government was taking the correct position that the concession contracts are null and void, negotiations with both PIATCO and Fraport were being conducted, to explore the possibility of avoiding protracted litigation. While the case was pending before the Supreme Court, both PIATCO and Fraport sued the government before two international arbitration bodies. We are vigorously defending our right to implement our own laws as a sovereign country in those two arbitration proceedings.\n\nThis includes the constitutional role of the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of the law. Its decisions must be and will be fully respected and upheld.\n\nImmediately upon assumption of my second term, I directed renewed efforts to arrive at a negotiated solution so that the terminal could be examined, and if it is safe, structurally sound, and conforms to international standards, open it in a way that adheres to law. Two new waves of effort were undertaken, but both failed, not because of any fault of Government, but due to deep reasons that prevent PIATCO and Fraport representatives from coming to a unified, reasonable position vis-a-vis the Republic. Those reasons are beyond the capability of the Republic to address and are internal to the two companies.\"\n\n229.\n\nThe President concluded her statement with the following commitment to, *inter* *alia,* Fraport:\n\n**\"Let me take this occasion to assure everyone that prompt just compensation will be paid in accordance with Philippine law. Existing legal processes will be observed, and due process will be accorded** ***[sic]*** **all genuine parties in interest, including foreign investors and contractors, who will have the full benefit of the observance of law. The Government has deposited the sum required by law into the custody of the expropriation court with the filing of the Complaint.\"** (emphasis added)\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent, in its Rejoinder, addressed the context in which the Terminal 3 expropriation was undertaken:\n\n\"In short, following the litigation before the Supreme Court, which finally concluded on January 21, 2004 when the Court issued its decision on reconsideration, PIATCO could not lawfully operate the Terminal. PIATCO, however, retained its rights in the terminal facility and denied government officials any access to it. PIATCO's unpaid contractor, Takenaka, in fact, fenced it off and employed armed guards to exclude the government officials and others from the premises. *That is, Takenaka barred entry to MIAA and DOTC and posted armed guards to physically exclude government personnel from the Terminal, a public utility situated on the Government\u2019s own land.* That situation was threatening the safety and security of the airport as a whole. At the same time the public need for the terminal was increasing with increasing passenger traffic, given that the Republic had refrained from improving Terminal 1 expecting that Terminal 3 would be operational by 2002. Finally, expropriation followed numerous serious efforts to resolve the situation amicably, ending with the last failed attempt several days earlier in December.\" (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted)\n\n231.\n\nAs noted, at the time of writing the present Award, the legal proceedings in connection with the expropriation of Terminal 3 have yet to reach their final resolution. The Tribunal has been informed by the parties that the expropriation proceedings have in fact resulted in literally dozens of related motions and orders which need not be described *in extenso* for purposes of this Award. The Tribunal nonetheless will summarize the key rulings and procedural milestones regarding the expropriation proceedings thus far, in particular as they relate to the compensation to be made to Fraport as a result of the expropriation of Terminal 3.\n\n**C. The Right of Eminent Domain or Expropriation Generally**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe right of eminent domain is defined as the right of the sovereign to appropriate any property within its territory for a public purpose. Under the Philippine Constitution, this right of eminent domain, or expropriation, is subjected to the requirement to pay just compensation6.\n\n1987 Philippine Constitution, Article III, \u00a7 9.\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the process for taking property by eminent domain or expropriation in the Philippines consists of two principal judicial stages: a first stage during which the authority and public purpose for the expropriation are scrutinized prior to the authorization of the expropriation, and a second stage in the course of which the just compensation for the expropriated property is determined.\n\n234.\n\nThe first stage focuses on the authority of the plaintiff to exercise the power of eminent domain and the propriety of its exercise in the specific case. It ends with an order (if the expropriation complaint is not dismissed) of condemnation declaring that the plaintiff has a lawful right to take the property sought to be condemned for the public use or purpose described in the complaint for expropriation, upon compensation to be determined as of the date of the complaint. The only requisites for judicial authorization of immediate entry upon the property pursuant to a writ of possession are (1) the filing of a complaint for expropriation sufficient in form and substance, and (2) the making of the deposit of an assessed value of the property at issue, also referred to as the \"proffered value\"7. It is observed that the writ of possession is issued by the court seized of the complaint on an *exparte* basis.\n\nRevised Rules of Court, Rule 67, \u00a7 2.\n\n235.\n\nAs noted, the second stage is concerned with the determination of the just compensation for the property to be taken. This is done by the court seized of the complaint for expropriation with the assistance of not more than three commissioners. In essence, the commissioners are required to view and examine the property sought to be expropriated, assess its value and make a full and accurate report to the court of all their proceedings. Thereafter, the court seized of the complaint is required to hold a hearing. A number of outcomes are then possible: the court may accept the commissioners' report and render judgment in accordance therewith or, for cause shown, recommit the file to the commissioners for a further report of facts; or, set aside the report and appoint new commissioners; or accept the report in part and reject it in part. In any case, the court may make such order or render such judgment as shall secure to the plaintiff the property essential to the exercise of the right of expropriation, and to the defendant just compensation for the property so taken.\n\n236.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal observes that just compensation for the expropriated property is based on market value, which is defined under Philippine law as the price which the expropriated property will command when it is offered for sale by one who desires, but is not obliged to sell it, and is purchased by one under no necessity of having it8. In this connection, the Tribunal further notes that the provisional deposit upon entry of the order of condemnation, *i.e.* the proffered value, serves the double purpose of prepayment upon the value of the property, if finally expropriated, and as an indemnity against damages if the expropriation suit fails9. The difference between, on the one hand, the proffered value already paid and, on the other hand, the just compensation as subsequently confirmed by the court, is to be paid when the court's decision on just compensation becomes final and executory.\n\n*Manila Railroad Company* v. *Caligsihan,* G.R.

The Initial Expropriation Proceedings Before the Regional Trial Court**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nExpropriation complaints in the Philippines are filed with the Regional Trial Court, which has original and exclusive jurisdiction over such matters. In the circumstances at issue, the complaint was filed on 21 December 2004 before the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, where Terminal 3 is located. A deposit with the Land Bank of the Philippines in the amount of US$62,343,175.77 was made by the plaintiffs, who were identified as the Republic of the Philippines, the Manila International Airport Authority and the Department of Transportation and Communications. PIATCO, as owner of Terminal 3, was impleaded as an indispensable party to the expropriation proceedings. The complaint for expropriation included a plea for the immediate issuance of a writ of possession of Terminal 3.\n\n238.\n\nThe Writ of Possession was obtained on the same day that the complaint was filed, *i.e.* on 21 December 2004, based on an Order issued by Judge Henrick Gingoyon of the Regional Trial Court. More particularly, Judge Gingoyon instructed that the plaintiffs be made \"in possession and control of the International Passenger Terminal 3 described above and to eject therefrom all adverse occupants, defendant Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc. and all other persons claiming under it\". The Tribunal notes that in his Order directing the issuance of the Writ of Possession, Judge Gingoyon took judicial notice of the Supreme Court's decision to \"set aside the 'PIATCO Contracts'\". Judge Gingoyon also stated that \"IPT 3 is a structure for a well-defined public purpose\". He concluded as follows:\n\n\"The case record shows that plaintiffs have deposited the assessed value of the IPT3 in the Land Bank of the Philippines, an authorized government depository, as shown by the certification attached to their complaint. This Court adds that due notice to the defendant PIATCO of the instant complaint has been made. Plaintiffs have thus complied with the requisites for the issuance of the writ of possession.\"\n\n239.\n\nOn 4 January 2005, Judge Gingoyon issued a supplemental order (\"January 4 Order\") that (a) directed the release of US$62,343,175.77 to PIATCO, which would be deducted from the yet-to-be determined amount of just compensation (b) directed the submission of a Certificate of Availability of Funds to cover the payment of just compensation and (c) pending the expropriation proceedings, directed the Republic, through the DOTC and the MIAA, to maintain, preserve and safeguard the Terminal, but prohibited them from performing \"acts of ownership such as awarding concessions or leasing any part of the NAIA IPT3 to other parties\". In so doing, Judge Gingoyon relied on Republic Act No. 8974 entitled \"An Act To Facilitate The Acquisition Of Right-Of-Way, Site Or Location For National Government Infrastructure Projects And For Other Purposes\" (R.A. No. 8974) as the applicable law.\n\n240.\n\nOn 5 January 2005, the Republic filed an Urgent Motion for Reconsideration of the January 4 Order. The Republic challenged the applicability of R.A. No. 8974 to Terminal 3 on the basis this law refers only to acquisition of real property needed as right-of-way, site, or location. The Republic also challenged the January 4 Order to release to PIATCO an amount which exceeded the provisional deposit.\n\n241.\n\nOn 7 January 2005, Judge Gingoyon issued a further supplemental Order (\"January 7 Order\") appointing three commissioners to value Terminal 3 and instructing them to take oaths of office within three days. On the same date, the Republic filed a Motion for Inhibition of the Regional Trial Court judge, *i.e.* Judge Gingoyon, which led to a hearing on both the Urgent Motion for Reconsideration and the Motion for Inhibition. The Republic argued that the January 4 and 7 Orders were issued *motu* *proprio* in favour of PIATCO, which had not yet entered its appearance or filed its answer. The hearing of both motions was held on 10 January 2005 and, on that same date, an Omnibus Order denying both the Motion for Reconsideration and the Motion for Inhibition was issued (\"January 10 Order\").\n\n242.\n\nTwo days later, on 12 January 2005, the Republic filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Supreme Court of the Philippines. While the outcome of this petition is discussed in greater detail later in this chapter, the Tribunal notes here that pursuant to its petition the Republic sought a temporary restraining order against the Regional Trial Court Judge Gingoyon to (1) cease implementing the January 4, 7 and 10 Orders; and (2) inhibit himself from further actions on the Republic's expropriation complaint. The Republic also sought nullification of the three orders at issue.\n\n243.\n\nOn 14 January 2005, notwithstanding its Petition for Certiorari before the Supreme Court, the Republic filed in the Regional Trial Court its \"Objections to the Appointment of Commissioners\". The Republic again objected that the January 7 Order had been issued *motu proprio* and with none of the interested parties having been notified or given the opportunity to be heard on the matter of appointment of commissioners. The Republic also objected *inter alia* to the alleged haste with which the January 7 Order was issued.\n\n244.\n\nOn 17 January 2005, PIATCO filed its Answer in the expropriation proceedings before the Regional Trial Court. More particularly, PIATCO sought the dismissal of the Republic's complaint for expropriation of 21 December 2004 on the basis that, *inter alia,* the Regional Trial Court lacked jurisdiction. PIATCO also raised the pending ICC arbitration between the same parties involving the \"same cause\" and maintained that the Republic had engaged in forum shopping.\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Republic argued in the hearing before the Regional Trial Court on 10 January 2005 that Fraport should be included as an interested party in the expropriation proceedings10. The Republic stated that while PIATCO was the named party in the expropriation complaint, Fraport, among others, is a necessary party which, though not indispensable, has a right to join if it so desires. However, to the Tribunal's knowledge, no such action has formally been taken by Fraport in the expropriation proceedings to date.\n\nTranscript of Stenographic Notes, 10 January 2005, 8:30 a.m., at page 9.\n\nE. **The Republic's Petition Before the Supreme Court**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nAs noted earlier, on 12 January 2005 the Republic filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Supreme Court of the Philippines. In essence, with this petition the Republic sought to prevent the implementation of the Regional Trial Court's Orders of 4, 7 and 10 January 2005. In effect, the Republic appealed against these orders. According to the Republic, these orders amounted to grave abuse of discretion and unjustly prejudiced its rights in the expropriation for substantially the reasons argued before the trial judge.\n\n247.\n\nOn 14 January 2005, the Supreme Court, in an *en bane* Resolution, issued a temporary restraining order instructing the trial judge to cease and desist from executing the assailed orders, thereby allowing the Republic to perform all acts necessary to accomplish the public purpose for which the expropriation was undertaken. PIATCO filed its comment on the Petition for Certiorari on 27 January 2005, and the Republic in turn filed a reply on 11 February 2005. In addition, on 4 April 2005, the Republic filed a Motion for Early Resolution with the Supreme Court, arguing that an expedited resolution of the Petition for Certiorari \"would allow the expropriation case before another branch of the Regional Trial Court in Pasay City, other than the present one, i.e. Branch 117, to progress in accordance with law and justice\". In a Resolution dated 26 April 2005, the Supreme Court required the parties to submit memoranda and by June 2005, the Petition for Certiorari was ready for resolution.\n\n248.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued its ruling on the Republic's Petition for Certiorari on 19 December 2005 (the *\"Gingoyon* decision\"). In brief, the Supreme Court's decision directed that the implementation of the 21 December 2004 Writ of Possession over Terminal 3 be held in abeyance, pending payment by the Republic to PIATCO of the amount of Php3,002,125,000.00 representing the proffered value of the Terminal.\n\n249.\n\nLess than two weeks later, on 2 January 2006, the Republic filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the Supreme Court's *Gingoyon* decision. The Republic's principal argument was that the release of the proffered value solely to PIATCO would deny full and final relief to the Philippine Government and would work an injustice to lawful claimants of the just compensation. In its Motion, the Republic referred to various claims against PIATCO such as Fraport's as well as judgment creditors of PIATCO, namely Takenaka and Asahikosan. The Republic argued that the amount of Php3,002,125,000.00 should not be released until legitimate claims against PIATCO with respect to the Terminal were ascertained and liquidated, and the fair value of the Terminal determined. The Republic also argued against the applicability of Republic Act No. 8974.\n\n250.\n\nMotions for intervention were filed with the Supreme Court after the promulgation of the *Gingoyon* decision. Takenaka filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration in Intervention on 5 January 2006, arguing that the Php3,002,125,000.00 amount should not be released to PIATCO pending the determination of its claim against PIATCO and the amount of just compensation. Takenaka pointed out that, after determining the value of the Terminal and the unsettled obligations of PIATCO, the just compensation may not be sufficient to settle PIATCO's obligations to its creditors. Takenaka informed the Supreme Court of its favourable judgments in the courts of the United Kingdom against PIATCO. In its separate motion of same date, Asahikosan made similar arguments.\n\n251.\n\nThe Supreme Court denied all these motions in a Resolution dated 1 February 2006. The interventions were denied as filed after promulgation of the *Gingoyon* decision, which the Supreme Court considered as contrary to procedural rules. In particular, the Supreme Court emphasized that the directive enjoining payment was in accordance with Republic Act No. 8974, which the Supreme Court again upheld as the applicable law.\n\n252.\n\nOn 17 March 2006, the Republic filed a Motion for Clarification and Second Motion for Reconsideration before the Supreme Court, praying that the Court clarify whether the awarding of concessions and leasing airport premises to airport-related operating businesses in Terminal 3 could be undertaken while full payment of the just compensation remained pending. The Republic also requested a reconsideration of the *Gingoyon* decision and the Supreme Court's Resolution of 1 February 2006. Alternatively, the Republic also requested that the deposit of the Terminal 3's proffered value be placed in escrow pending determination of just compensation due to PIATCO. The Supreme Court denied this Second Motion for Reconsideration as a prohibited pleading under the Rules of Court in a Resolution dated 21 February 2006. The *Gingoyon* decision thus became final and executory, and an Entry of Judgment was thereafter made on 17 March 2006. More particularly, the following rulings in the *Gingoyon* decision were entered into judgment as final and executory11:\n\nG.R. No. 166429, 19 December 2005.\n\n253.\n\nFirst, the Supreme Court stated that its 21 January 2004 Resolution denying PIATCO's motions for reconsideration of the *Agan* decision was the principal reason why it ruled as it did in respect of the issues raised in the *Gingoyon* Petition for Certiorari. The Tribunal recalls that in its January 2004 Resolution, the Supreme Court specifically held that the Government had to pay PIATCO just compensation in accordance with law and equity prior to taking over Terminal 3. According to the *Gingoyon* decision, \"[t]his pronouncement contains the fundamental premises which permeate [the *Agan]* decision of the Court\", and \"any disposition of the present petition must conform to the conditions laid down by the Court in its 2004 *Resolution\".* It is abundantly clear that the Supreme Court of the Philippines was well aware of the close nexus between its *Agan* decision and the *Gingoyon* decision.\n\n254.\n\nSecond, the Supreme Court ruled that Republic Act No. 8974 and its Implementing Rules provided the legal regime which the Government had to follow in the expropriation of Terminal 3, and not Rule 67 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, the amount of payment to PIATCO under R.A. No. 8974 was to include the value of the improvements and/or structures on the land.\n\n255.\n\nThird, the Supreme Court ruled that because there was no way to ascertain immediately the value of the improvements, a factual determination, the Republic had to pay PIATCO a provisional amount denominated the \"proffered value\" of Terminal 3 pursuant to R.A. No. 897412. The Supreme Court refused to accept PIATCO's argument that the proffered value be set at its alleged Terminal cost of \"not less than US$ 350 million\". Instead, the Supreme Court deemed that the proffered value should be equal to the amount the Republic had deposited to commence the expropriation proceedings, *i.e.* Php3,002,125,000.00. The Supreme Court ruled that the Republic could not take possession of the Terminal until it paid PIATCO the proffered value13.\n\nSection 4(c) of R.A. 8974 provides in relevant part that \"in case the completion of a government infrastructure project is of utmost urgency and importance, and there is no existing valuation of the area concerned, the implementing agency shall immediately pay the owner of the property its proffered value\".\n\nThe Supreme Court suspended the Republic's Writ of Possession to the Terminal until PIATCO was paid the proffered value.\n\n256.\n\nFourth, the Supreme Court recognized a critical distinction between possession of the Terminal through a Writ of Possession upon payment of the proffered value, and \"taking over\" the Terminal upon paying PIATCO just compensation, which was the same as exercising full ownership rights over the Terminal. The Supreme Court ruled that the Government is limited under the Writ of Possession \"to perform the acts that are essential to the operation of the NAIA 3 as an international airport terminal. [...] These would include the repair, reconditioning and improvement of the complex, maintenance of the existing facilities and equipment, installation of new facilities and equipment, provision of services and facilities pertaining to the facilitation of air traffic and transport, and other services that are integral to a modern-day international airport\". However, until the Government paid PIATCO final payment of just compensation, the Government could not \"perform[] acts of ownership such as awarding concessions or leasing any part of NAIA 3 to other parties\".\n\n257.\n\nFifth, to ensure that PIATCO was promptly paid, the Supreme Court ruled that the Regional Trial Court must determine the amount of PIATCO's just compensation within the 60-day period for paying a property owner just compensation as set forth in R.A. No. 8974. This time period would start to run from the date of the \"finality\" of the Supreme Court's decision.\n\n258.\n\nSixth, the Supreme Court ruled that the appointment of three Commissioners to hear evidence on valuation under Rule 67 was appropriate under the circumstances and that any objection to the appointments was to be lodged with the Regional Trial Court and not by way of petition to the Supreme Court.\n\n**F. The Subsequent Proceedings Before the Regional Trial Court**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nOn 27 March 2006, the Regional Trial Court, referring to the \"finality\" of the *Gingoyon* decision and without being seized of any motion, ordered the issuance of a Writ of Execution, and the release of Php3,002,125,000.00 to PIATCO.\n\n260.\n\nOn the same date, the ceiling of the arrival lobby section of Terminal 3 collapsed. This prompted the Republic to file an Urgent Motion to Quash the Writ of Execution of 27 March 2006. Pointing to the supervening event of the collapse of the ceiling, as well as the procedural requirement under the Philippine Rules of Court that writs of execution can only be issued upon motion by the prevailing party, the Republic challenged the issuance of the Writ of Execution. A hearing on the Republic's Motion to Quash was held on 7 April 2006. PIATCO filed its comment on 12 April 2006.\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that AEDC, which had filed a Motion for Intervention in the expropriation proceedings, filed a Manifestation and Motion dated 8 May 2006 praying that the resolution of the Republic's Motion to Quash be held in abeyance pending resolution of its Motion for Intervention. This Manifestation and Motion were promptly met with PIATCO's Opposition on 16 May 2006. The Tribunal further notes that throughout the valuation proceedings, AEDC attempted to prevent the payment of the Terminal's proffered value to PIATCO14.\n\nFor example, in a brief filed with the Supreme Court on 5 September 2006, AEDC asserted that it had a legal right as \"original proponent\" of the Terminal to obtain the concession to operate the facility and accordingly argued that the Republic cannot assume ownership of the Terminal or transfer it to third parties without AEDC's consent.\n\n262.\n\nIn an Order dated 15 June 2006, the Regional Trial Court denied the Republic's Urgent Motion to Quash the Writ of Execution. The Court, upholding the arguments in PIATCO's comment, concluded that collapse of the ceiling could not be considered as a supervening event that would warrant quashing the Writ of Execution. The Court opined that the collapse of the ceiling did not have a direct effect on the matter already litigated and settled by the Supreme Court in *Gingoyon,* as it did not create a substantial change in the rights or relations of the parties. The Court directed immediate compliance by the Republic with the Order of 27 March 2006.\n\n263.\n\nFollowing the denial of the Urgent Motion to Quash, the Republic filed an Urgent Manifestation and Motion on 21 June 2006 declaring that it would comply with the order of payment, but requested that, in anticipation of the operation of the Terminal, the Court issue an order granting plaintiffs an effective writ of possession authorizing them to implement the Terminal 3 project by performing acts essential to the operation of an international airport passenger terminal, such as the awarding and execution of lease contracts and concession agreements. PIATCO opposed this Motion on the basis that it was identical to the Motion for Clarification and Second Motion for Reconsideration which the Republic had filed previously in the *Gingoyon* case.\n\n264.\n\nIn an oral hearing before the Regional Trial Court on 23 and 28 June 2006, the Republic reiterated its commitment to pay the proffered value as required under Philippine law while requesting confirmation of its rights under the Writ of Possession. During the hearing, EPC contractors Takenaka and Asahikosan requested that the release of payment be held in abeyance pending a determination of the amount of just compensation and the identification of the rightful claimants. In order to determine what action needed to be taken in view of Takenaka's interest as a judgment creditor of PIATCO (now judgment creditor for the unpaid US$83 million on the EPC Contract) and also in the interest of orderly procedure, the Court declared on 28 June 2006 that it would resolve the remaining pending motions in an Omnibus Order before it ordered the actual release of the Republic's deposited proffered value.\n\n265.\n\nThus, by Order dated 7 August 2006, the Regional Trial Court denied the Republic's Urgent Manifestation and Motion. This Order was followed by an Order on 8 August 2006 denying all motions for intervention from third parties, including those of Takenaka, and another Order on 9 August 2006 directing the Manila International Airport Authority and the Land Bank of the Philippines to cause the release of the Php3,002,125,000.00 to a duly authorized PIATCO representative. The Board of Directors of the Manila International Airport Authority accordingly issued a Board Resolution where it \"approved the payment to PIATCO of the proffered value of NAIA Terminal 3\" and authorized its General Manager \"to take the necessary steps in order to effect immediate payment of the said proffered value to PIATCO\". The second stage proceedings for the valuation of the Terminal for payment of just compensation could then commence.\n\n**G. The Valuation Proceedings by the Court-Appointed Commissioners**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nUnder Rule 67 of the Philippine Rules of Court, which is suppletory to Republic Act No. 8974, upon payment of the proffered value by the Republic and issuance of the order of expropriation (already issued), just compensation is determined by three competent and disinterested commissioners in order to ascertain and report to the court the just compensation for the expropriated property. Evidence may be introduced by either party to the proceedings who may also examine the property sought to be expropriated.\n\n267.\n\nAs noted earlier, the determination of just compensation and the transfer of title to the Republic is the last stage of the expropriation proceedings. As also noted earlier, on 7 January 2005, the Regional Trial Court had already issued an order appointing three commissioners for the determination of just compensation, to which the Republic had filed its objections on 14 January 2005, questioning the competence of the appointees. The resolution of this matter had been held in abeyance pending resolution of the *Gingoyon* case. On 5 April 2006, the Regional Trial Court issued an Order denying the Republic's opposition and set the oath-taking of the commissioners for 11 April 2006. The Regional Trial Court ordered the commissioners to submit their report on the valuation of the Terminal on or before 22 May 2006.\n\n268.\n\nThe Republic filed a Motion for Reconsideration on 11 April 2006, on the grounds that (1) the appointed commissioners did not appear to be competent for the task; and (2) there was no showing that the appointed commissioners were disinterested. Of particular relevance to the present arbitration, the Republic of the Philippines submitted that since the determination of the valuation of the Terminal and the just compensation for its taking would impact *inter alia* on the ICSID arbitration proceedings, the valuation should be made by a disinterested, competent and respected international airport engineering construction expert. Only in this way would the valuation be respected by international tribunals. PIATCO took issue with these arguments in its comment of 26 April 2006. In the interim, on 12 April 2006, the Regional Trial Court ordered a valuation conference to be held between the parties and the appointed commissioners on 18 April 2006. On 19 April 2006, the Regional Trial Court ordered an \"ocular inspection\" of the Terminal to be held on 25 April 2006.\n\n269.\n\nThe Republic filed a Manifestation and Motion on 24 April 2006 praying that the Regional Trial Court resolve all pending motions, including a number of motions filed by various intervenors, before continuing with the valuation proceedings. In light of the unresolved objections to the appointment of commissioners, the Republic also objected to the \"ocular inspection\" and submitted that it should not be considered part of the valuation proceedings but should merely be a \"visit\" to the Terminal. The viewing of the Terminal nonetheless proceeded on 25 April 2006, with all parties present.\n\n270.\n\nIn a Request for Extension of Time by Court-Appointed Commissioners, filed on 5 May 2006, the commissioners asked the Regional Trial Court to allow them \"to determine the appropriate appraised value unilaterally by engaging an internationally accepted professional entity that would perform the actual technical work of appraisal of the Terminal in question\". The commissioners also asked for an extension of three months to complete the task of determining just compensation.\n\n271.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Section 4 of R.A. No. 8974 provides that in the event the owner of the property contests the implementing agency's proffered value, the Regional Trial Court shall determine the just compensation to be paid to the owner within sixty (60) days from the date of the filing of the expropriation case. It will be recalled that the Supreme Court in its decision in *Gingoyon* directed the Regional Trial Court to determine just compensation within the same period. However, consistent with the Court's inherent power to control its own processes, the commissioners' Motion for extension of time was granted by the Court in its Order of 17 May 2006. This Order was silent on the matter of the commissioner's proposed engagement of an \"internationally accepted professional entity\".\n\n272.\n\nOn 22 May 2006, the Republic filed a Manifestation stating that it had retained the international engineering firms of TCGI Engineers, Ove Arup Consulting, and Gleeds Management Services for the assessment of the safety, operability and value of Terminal 3. The Republic informed the Regional Trial Court that notwithstanding its continuing objection to the appointment of the commissioners, it would submit the final report of these engineering firms for use in the expropriation proceedings. Three days later, on 25 May 2006, the Republic filed a Motion for Production and Inspection of Documents and Things.\n\n273.\n\nOn 11 September 2006, while the valuation proceedings were pending, the Government of the Philippines made a provisional payment to PIATCO representing a proffered value for the Terminal of Php3,002,125,000.00. The Tribunal notes that PIATCO transferred approximately half of this amount, *i.e.* US$29 million, to Fraport during the month of September15. On that same date, *i.e.* on 11 September 2006, the Regional Trial Court issued an Order memorializing payment of the proffered value to PIATCO and stated that the Republic had complied with the Supreme Court's *Gingoyon* decision and the Regional Trial Court's Orders directing payment. The Regional Trial Court thus reinstated the Republic's Writ of Possession over Terminal 3 dated 21 December 2004.\n\nIn a press release dated 25 September 2006 posted on Fraport's website (www.fraport.com) under the heading \"Fraport Receives First Payment for Manila Terminal Project\", the following is stated:  \nThe Philippine government has made a first partial compensation payment of 3,002,125,000 Philippine pesos (about US$60 million) to PIATCO terminal company, in which Fraport AG holds a 30-percent share. Of this amount, some US$29 million were transferred to Fraport AG's account in Frankfurt today. Part of this amount is the redemption of a loan which Fraport granted to PIATCO. The remainder of this initial payment was used for the reduction of other PIATCO liabilities. The definitive total amount of compensation shall soon be determined with the help of independent experts.  \n This is a first success in our efforts to get appropriate compensation for our investment in the Philippines,' said Fraport AG's executive board chairman Dr. Wilhelm Bender. The sum remitted can therefore only be a down payment for PIATCO. We are still vigorously pursuing the arbitration procedure before the World Bank in Washington.' The full amount of the payment made will have an effect on earnings in the current business year so that Fraport will show additional non-recuring income of about \u20ac22.6 million.\n\n274.\n\nThe commissioners subsequently held a valuation conference with the Republic and PIATCO on 21 September 2006, during which the commissioners stated that the quantitative determination of just compensation could be simplified if the parties could agree on the valuation. The parties were invited to confer and consider whether they were willing to engage in negotiations. In a conference on 19 October 2006, the commissioners again proposed setting aside a period of time to negotiate and attempt to reduce the issues in dispute. The commissioners nevertheless stated that they would simultaneously seek presentations for a formal valuation in the event negotiations were not fruitful.\n\n275.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that a subsequent commissioners' conference on 30 October 2006 was attended by representatives of the Republic and PIATCO, as well as by Fraport official Peter Henkel and legal counsel for Takenaka.\n\n276.\n\nThe next valuation conference took place on 24 November 2006, during which the commissioners stated that the informal negotiations between the parties had failed. The formal valuation would accordingly proceed and, to this end, an independent appraiser would be appointed.\n\n277.\n\nThe parties to the valuation proceedings were subsequently requested to provide the commissioners with various documents, including the Tender documents, the Terminal-related contracts between the Republic and PIATCO as well as the EPC Contract. The commissioners' request for documents resulted in a production Order dated 5 January 2007. As of the date of the present Award, the parties had yet to fully comply with this Order, and an independent appraiser had yet to be appointed to proceed with the formal valuation of Terminal 3.\n\n278.\n\nAs a final observation, it is noted that on 17 March 2007, the Regional Trial Court modified its Order of 8 August 2006 and allowed the intervention of Takenaka and Asahikosan in the expropriation proceedings. The Court held that the two firms, as PIATCO's construction contractor and procurement supplier, are in the best position to elucidate actual construction costs, which is the most important consideration facing the commissioners and the Court.\n\n279.\n\nThe valuation phase of the expropriation proceedings regarding the Terminal continues as of the date of the present Award. As they progress, the Tribunal recalls the commitment made by President Macapagal-Arroyo on 24 December 2004 when Respondent instituted the expropriation proceedings to take possession of Terminal 3:\n\n\"Let me take this occasion to assure everyone that prompt just compensation will be paid in accordance with Philippine law. Existing legal processes will be observed, and due process will be accorded *[sic]* all genuine parties in interest, including foreign investors and contractors, who will have the full benefit of the observance of law. The Government has deposited the sum required by law into the custody of the expropriation court with the filing of the Complaint.\"\n\n**IV. THE RESPONDENT'S JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Treaty**\n-----------------\n\n280.\n\nBefore addressing the Respondent's jurisdictional challenge, it is essential to reproduce those provisions of the Treaty which the Tribunal is called upon to interpret and analyze in this regard.\n\n281.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the Preamble to the Treaty, as well as part of Article 1, read as follows:\n\n\"The Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of the Philippines\n\nhereinafter referred to as the Contracting States,\n\nDesiring to intensify economic co-operation between both States;\n\nIntending to create favorable conditions for investments by nationals and companies of either Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State, and to increase prosperity in their respective territories;\n\nRecognizing that encouragement and protection of such investments will benefit the economic prosperity of both States -\n\nHave agreed as follows:\n\n**Article 1 Definition of Terms**\n\nFor the purpose of this Agreement:\n\n1. The term 'investment' shall mean any kind of asset **accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State,** and more particularly, though not exclusively:\n\n(a) movable and immovable property as well as other rights in rem, such as mortgages, liens, pledges, usufructs and similar rights;\n\n(b) shares of stocks and debentures of companies or interest in the property of such companies;\n\n(c) claims to money utilized for the purpose of creating an economic value or to any performance having an economic value;\n\n(d) intellectual property rights, in particular copyrights, patents, utility-model patents, registered designs, trademarks, tradenames, trade and business secrets, technical processes, knowhow, and good will;\n\n(e) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources;\n\nany alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their classification as an investment.\" (emphasis added)\n\n282.\n\nParagraph 1 of Article 2 of the Treaty further contains the following relevant provisions regarding jurisdiction:\n\n**\"Article 2 Promotion and Acceptance**\n\n(1) Each Contracting State shall promote as far as possible investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting State and **admit such investments in accordance with its Constitution, laws and regulations** as referred to in Article 1 paragraph 1. Such investments shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment.\" (emphasis added)\n\n283.\n\nAlso of significance to the issue of jurisdiction are the following provisions from the Protocol to the Treaty:\n\n**\"Protocol to the Agreement** **between the Federal Republic of Germany** **and the Republic of the Philippines concerning the** **Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments**\n\n(2) Ad Article 2\n\n(a) As provided for in the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, foreign investors are not allowed to own land in the territory of the Republic of the Philippines. However, investors are allowed to own up to 40 % of the equity of a company which can then acquire ownership of land.\n\n(5) Ad Article 5\n\n(a) With respect to the Republic of the Philippines it is understood that duly registered investments are assets of any kind as defined in Article 1, **admitted in accordance with Article 2 (1)** and reported to competent governmental agencies at the time the investment was made. It is further understood, that the transfer guarantee is not limited to the capital values of the investments that have been duly registered. The Republic of the Philippines will relax as soon as possible existing reporting requirements.\" (emphasis added)\n\n284.\n\nWith these Treaty provisions in mind, the Tribunal now turns to the parties' respective positions regarding the issue of jurisdiction. As the Respondent is the moving party, the Tribunal will consider its arguments in this regard first. The Tribunal will then review the Claimant's arguments regarding jurisdiction.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nIn essence, the Respondent challenges the Tribunal's jurisdiction in this arbitration on the basis that the protections afforded by the BIT at issue do not extend to investments made in violation of Philippine law. The premise to this challenge is that the BIT entered into between the Philippines and Germany provides the only possible basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Claimant's BIT claims. In this regard, the Respondent refers to the \"limited nature\" of the BIT's application and contends that the Claimant's investment falls outside of the BIT's expressly limited scope because it was not made in compliance with Philippine law. In brief, the Respondent avers that the Claimant's investment was not \"accepted\" in accordance with the laws of the Philippines, in the words of Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\n286.\n\nIt is in this connection that the Respondent emphasizes that \"even once 'admitted' an investment may fall outside the scope of the BIT's protections where it is implemented in a manner that materially violates the host State's laws that directly regulate the investment or the investment activities\". In other words, the duty to comply with the host State's law is an ongoing one which must be respected throughout the period in which the investment is made. It is also in this connection that the Respondent posits that \"[t]he burden is on the investor to ensure that its investment complies with host State law if the investor wishes to avail itself of the rights and benefits of the BIT\".\n\n287.\n\nMore particularly, the Respondent contends that the Terminal 3 concession is a public utility subject to the nationality restrictions of the Philippine Constitution and the prohibitions imposed by the ADL, and that both have application to Fraport's investment in PIATCO. It is the Respondent's contention that Fraport openly sought to evade the nationality requirement limiting foreign ownership of the capital of a public utility to 40% through the device of \"indirect\" ownership coupled with the secret shareholder agreements referred to earlier in this Award16. The Respondent argues that Fraport sought *de facto* control of the Terminal 3 project and/or of PIATCO as the corporate vehicle of Fraport's investment because its Supervisory Board would not otherwise permit the flow of its funds into the Terminal 3 project.\n\n*Supra* at paragraph 125.\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent expands on its argument that the BIT's protections extend only to investments made in accordance with Philippine law by referring to, *inter alia,* the decision in the ICSID case of *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A.* v. *Kingdom* *of Morocco17.* Where a BIT contemplates, as it allegedly does here, a threshold analysis of the legality of the investment as a jurisdictional matter, such an analysis must be conducted. According to the Respondent, broad and general statements in the preamble to a BIT to the effect that it is meant to promote investments cannot serve as grounds to circumvent the duty to conduct this analysis. The Respondent argues that \"interpreting the provisions of a BIT requires a balanced approach that takes into consideration that States seek to create favourable environments for the promotion of investment, but not at the cost of other *[sic]* imperatives legal and regulatory imperatives that must be respected in order to promote and sustain governments based on the rule of law\".\n\nICSID Case No.ARB/00/4 (23 July 2001).\n\n289.\n\nIn terms of the applicable standard regarding jurisdiction, the Respondent refers to the Claimant's argument that the Tribunal must dismiss the Respondent's jurisdictional objection if it is satisfied that the Claimant has \"alleged facts\" that if proven would be \"capable of falling with *[sic]* the provisions of the treaty\". According to the Respondent, the Claimant's argument confuses the general standard of proof for establishing jurisdictional elements with the standard applied to assessing the sufficiency of claims that the substantive terms of the BIT have been breached. The Respondent further adds that it is not challenging whether the causes of action alleged by the Claimant are capable of constituting violations of the BIT. Rather, the Respondent's jurisdictional objection focuses on whether a basic element necessary to establish jurisdiction is present, *i.e.* the existence of an investment covered by the BIT.\n\n290.\n\nFinally, according to the Respondent, it is precisely because the Claimant's capital investments, loans and guarantees to PIATCO were made in violation of the Philippine Constitution and ADL that they do not benefit from the BIT's protection. In particular, the Respondent contends that, starting in 1999, the Claimant structured its investment in PIATCO in a manner that was intended to evade Philippine nationality and anti-dummy laws. It devised a series of arrangements designed to assure that it could exert influence and control over PIATCO, including authority to make additional appointments to PIATCO's board, veto rights over decisions of the terminal operator, pooling arrangements to permit it to influence areas of terminal operations and retail management, as well as contractual arrangements through which it had the exclusive authority to determine the financial arrangements for the Terminal 3 project. The Respondent further states that the Claimant had been advised that \"arrangements, other than mere equity investments between FAG *[i.e.* Fraport] and the Company *[i.e.* PIATCO], must be considered carefully\".\n\n291.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, the Respondent's jurisdictional challenge, to the extent that it relates to the Claimant's alleged non-compliance with Philippine law (with emphasis on ADL prohibitions), is based on the following statement: \"The point is not that Fraport controlled PIATCO, but that Fraport tried but failed to control PIATCO, and in so doing violated the Philippine Anti-Dummy Law.\" According to the Respondent, the Claimant's (failed) attempt to control PIATCO is conclusively evidenced by the secret shareholder agreements produced by the Claimant in December 2005 and during the hearing in January 2006.\n\n**C. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Claimant's central position on jurisdiction is that its investment, which allegedly totals more than US$425 million, was made in accordance with Philippine law. In the Claimant's own words:\n\n\"Fraport's indirect investment in PIATCO by means of the cascade companies allowed funds to be provided to the Terminal 3 project in compliance with Philippine law, including Philippine restrictions on foreign ownership of public utilities. The members of the Cheng family are citizens of the Philippines and control PIATCO. Fraport is a 30% non-controlling shareholder of PIATCO notwithstanding its 61.44% direct and indirect ownership of PIATCO through the cascade companies.\"\n\n293.\n\nIn terms of general observations, the Claimant maintains that the \"Respondent's arguments based on Fraport's non-compliance with the 'anti-dummy' and nationality laws should also be understood as inventions for this arbitration\", and states that the Philippines has not \"ever taken any action under its own laws to charge Fraport with any violation of those laws\".\n\n294.\n\nRegarding the manner in which its investment was structured, the Claimant makes this further general observation:\n\n\"An obvious fundamental flaw of Respondent's argument is its failure to distinguish between economic participation and management control. Fraport is a *minority* shareholder in PIATCO. Control is in the hands of the majority shareholders of PIATCO, the Cheng family. Fraport is also a *minority* shareholder in the cascade companies, and Fraport does not have control over any company owning stock in PIATCO. This was the structure by which Fraport complied with the Philippine law's prohibition against its having control over a public utility while also achieving an economic interest commensurate with its investment. Fraport should not be viewed with suspicion for having structured its investments on the basis of legal advice so as to have the influence in the project that Philippine law permitted.\" (emphasis in original)\n\n295.\n\nAs a theme running through its arguments on jurisdiction, the Claimant emphasizes that the Respondent has long known the details of PIATCO's shareholding structure, and never charged the Claimant in the Philippines with violating its foreign ownership laws. In particular, the Claimant maintains that its investment(s) has always been fully disclosed to the Philippine SEC, and furthermore that the Respondent was aware of the Claimant's investment(s) at the highest levels of government. The Claimant also makes the point that although it was provided with a chart of PIATCO's shareholder structure, the Philippine Supreme Court did not address this issue in its May 2003 *Agan* decision. The Claimant stresses that it asked for and followed legal advice to ensure it respected the law while achieving permissible influence in the Terminal 3 project.\n\n296.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant maintains that the Philippine SEC and DOX have rendered opinions to the effect that \"companies that are at least 60% owned by Philippine nationals are considered Filipino-owned irrespective of minority ownership\". Similarly, it submits that the Respondent's own description of facts and the statements of its witnesses foreclose the argument that the Claimant controlled PIATCO in violation of Philippine law and that, furthermore, none of the Respondent's experts on Philippine law conclude that the Claimant violated Philippine law.\n\n297.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the BIT creates an obligation for the Respondent to admit foreign investments. The Claimant argues that \"tribunals will look to the broader purpose of a BIT when defining the scope of a clause containing a reference to the admission of foreign investments and their compliance with local laws\" (emphasis added). The Claimant adds that the interpretation of BIT provisions must be guided by the fact that the purpose of bilateral investment treaties is to promote foreign investments.\n\n298.\n\nFinally, it is the Claimant's contention that the parties' dispute in this arbitration is indeed about an \"investment\" made pursuant to the BIT. The Claimant makes a number of assertions in this regard. First, the Claimant maintains that its *prima facie* showing that its investment satisfied Philippine law has not been rebutted, with the result that the investment must be deemed accepted under the BIT. Second, the Claimant stresses that the Respondent bears the burden to produce evidence that Fraport's investment was not in accordance with its laws, and that the Respondent cannot satisfy its burden merely by showing non-compliance with local laws. The Claimant also argues that its compliance with Philippine law must be assessed at the time of the investment. Finally, the Claimant maintains that acts of approval and acquiescence of competent authorities constitute further evidence that the Respondent accepted the Claimant's investment(s).\n\n299.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal's analysis and findings in light of the parties' respective arguments and submissions on jurisdiction follow.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS ON JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Preliminary Observations**\n-------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nAs gleaned from the overview of their respective arguments regarding the issue of jurisdiction, the parties fundamentally disagree on the scope of the BIT in terms of limitations imposed by the laws and regulations of the host state. In order to make a determination in this regard, the terms of Article 1(1) of the BIT will be recalled:\n\n**\"Article 1**\n\n**Definition of Terms**\n\nFor the purpose of this Agreement:\n\n1. The term 'investment' shall mean any kind of asset **accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State,** and more particularly, though not exclusively:\n\n(a) movable and immovable property as well as other rights in rem, such as mortgages, liens, pledges, usufructs and similar rights;\n\n(b) shares of stocks and debentures of companies or interest in the property of such companies;\n\n(c) claims to money utilized for the purpose of creating an economic value or to any performance having an economic value;\n\n(d) intellectual property rights, in particular copyrights, patents, utility-model patents, registered designs, trademarks, tradenames, trade and business secrets, technical processes, know-how, and good will;\n\n(e) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources;\n\nany alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their classification as an investment.\" (emphasis added)\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that as a result of the BIT's wording, the arguments of both parties address at some length the interpretation to be given to the term \"accepted\" used in the BIT. For instance, the Respondent points to the following passage from UNCTAD:\n\n\"In agreements that apply this limitation, investment that was not established in accordance with the host country's laws and regulations would not fall within the definition of investment' as used in the agreement.\n\nSuch a limitation in an investment agreement obviously is intended to induce foreign investors to ensure that all local laws and regulations are satisfied in the course of establishing an investment by denying treaty coverage to noncompliant investment.\"18\n\nUNCTAD, *Scope and Definition: UNCTAD Series on issues in international investment agreements* at page 24.\n\n302.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to the \"objective standard of lawfulness\" which must be met. It quotes, in aid of its argument, the following extract from the Dolzer and Stevens treatise:\n\n\"A further important consideration as to the limited scope of the BIT's application is that the requirement that investments be made in accordance with law is premised upon an objective standard of lawfulness.\n\nBITs generally do not include any specific requirements that an investor must follow other than that it must be done in accordance with the law; however, a few BITs have laid down objective conditions in the treaty itself.\n\nAlthough therefore not a common phenomenon, it is critical to examine whether this type of condition has been introduced by the Contracting Parties, insofar as it may well exclude investments that would otherwise fall under the treaty.\"19\n\nRudolf Dolzer and Margrete Stevens, *Bilateral Investment Treaties* (1995) at page 54.\n\n303.\n\nThe Claimant argues that this passage from Dolzer and Stevens is inapposite as it relates solely to circumstances where a State has laws and regulations for the admittance of investments. More particularly, the Claimant does not accept that Article 1(1) of the\n\nBIT can be construed as a substantive jurisdictional limitation. The Claimant elaborates\n\nas follows:\n\n\"[...] An analysis of other BITs shows that there is nothing 'remarkable' about the phrase 'in accordance with domestic law', as it appears to be a common feature of BITs. Even if one were to conclude that these phrases reflect a special emphasis on the part of the contracting parties, **such emphasis may only be understood to concern the right of States to regulate the initial access of foreign investments to their territories.** This is acknowledged by Professor Dolzer. Such barriers to foreign investment are not, however, at issue in the current dispute.\" (emphasis added)\n\n304.\n\nThe Claimant adds:\n\n\"It further derives from the object and purpose of the BIT that the phrase 'in accordance with the law' shall not be understood to mean that foreign investments have to comply with each and every provision of domestic law or else risk forfeiture of the protection afforded by the BIT. As Professor Dolzer concedes, 'it would appear implausible to argue that each infraction of the local laws would deprive the investor of the guarantees laid down in the BIT'. Such a conclusion would also contradict general principles of law, such as Article 27 of the Vienna Convention, which provides that '[a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty'.\n\nFurther, a tribunal would have jurisdiction to hear a claim even in the presence of a violation of local investment laws that could otherwise deprive it of jurisdiction when, for example, 'the actions of the Respondent were out of proportion with any non-compliance that may have existed'. It would indeed be inappropriate and inconsistent with the BIT to deprive the investor of the protections of the BIT on the basis of non-compliance with municipal law where, for example, such noncompliance may be cured or rectified by the investor.\"\n\n305.\n\nIt is further observed that the boundaries of this Tribunal's jurisdiction are delimited by the arbitration agreement, in the instant case, both the BIT and the Washington Convention. Article 25 of the Washington Convention, which provides, *inter alia,* parameters of jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* does not define \"investment\", leaving it to parties who incorporate ICSID jurisdiction to provide a definition if they wish. In bilateral investment treaties which incorporate an ICSID arbitration option, the word \"investment\" is a term of art, whose content in each instance is to be determined by the language of the pertinent BIT which serves as a *lex specialis* with respect to Article 25 of the Washington Convention.\n\n306.\n\nWith respect to a bilateral investment treaty that defines \"investment\", it is possible that an economic transaction that might qualify *factually and financially* as an investment *(i.e.* be comprised of capital imported by a foreign entity into the economy of another state which is party to a BIT), falls, nonetheless, outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal established under the pertinent BIT, because *legally* it is not an \"investment\" within the meaning of the BIT. This will occur when the transaction that might otherwise qualify as an \"investment\" fails *ratione temporis,* as occurred in *Empresa Lucchetti S.A. et ah* v. *Republic of Peru20,* or fails *ratione personae,* as occurred in *Soufraki* v. *The United Arab Emirates21.* It will also occur when the transaction fails to qualify *ratione materiae,* as occurred in *Inceysa Vallisoletana, S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador22.*\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/4 (7 February 2005).\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/02/07 (7 July 2004).\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/26 (2 August 2006)\n\n307.\n\nIn the case before this Tribunal, there are no plausible objections to its jurisdiction *ratione temporis* or *ratione personae.* Objections have, however, been lodged with respect to its jurisdiction *ratione materiae.* In addressing these objections, the Tribunal will first consider the factual allegations regarding the Claimant's investment as it relates to the laws of the Philippines, in particular the ADL. The Tribunal will then set forth the legal standards established by the relevant instruments before proceeding to elaborate its own analysis.\n\n**B. The Pertinent Facts**\n--------------------------\n\n308.\n\nOn 11 January 1999, the law firm of Quisumbing Torres (\"QT\"), which is based in Manila and is affiliated with Baker & McKenzie, submitted a preliminary due diligence report on legal issues to Fraport or FAG as it was then known as part of Fraport's preparations for its planned investment in the Philippines. Lest segments be taken out of context, the Tribunal believes it will be useful to quote *in extenso,* emphasizing the portions of the QT report that are of special relevance by setting them in boldface.\n\n309.\n\nAt pages 6-9 of its report, QT stated:\n\n\" Regulatory Environment\n\nWe set out certain general aspects of Philippine law, which will assist in understanding this preliminary Report:\n\n(a) Foreign Ownership. RA 7042, Foreign Investments Act of 1991, as amended ('FIA') governs and regulates equity investments in domestic corporations made by non-Philippine nationals, either in the form of foreign exchange or other assets actually transferred into the Philippines.\n\nGenerally, a non-Philippine national may own up to 100% of domestic corporations, except domestic corporations engaged in any business activity included in the Negative List of the FIA. The Negative List of the FIA contains the areas of economic activities where foreign ownership is prohibited or limited. The Negative List contains 2 lists, List A and List B. List A contains areas of investment where foreign ownership is limited by mandate of the Philippine Constitution and/or by specific laws. List B contains areas of investment where foreign ownership is limited for reasons of security, defense, risk to health and morals and protection of local small and medium scale enterprises.\n\nThe following are included in the Negative Lists of the FIA:\n\n\u25cf Operation and ownership of public utilities (up to 40% foreign equity allowed)m\n\n\u25cf Retail Trade (no foreign equity allowed)m\n\n\u25cf The practice of licensed professions such as engineering (no foreign equity allowed)m\n\n\u25cf Ownership of private lands (up to 40% foreign equity allowed)m and\n\n\u25cf Advertising (up to 30% foreign equity allowed).\n\nIn respect of ownership and operation of public utilities, the Philippine Constitution provides that:\n\nNo franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted **except to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations organized under the laws of the Philippines at least sixty percentum of whose capital is owned by such citizens,** nor shall such franchise, certificate or authorization be exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. Neither shall any such franchise or right be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires. The State shall encourage equity participation in public utilities by the general public. **The participation of foreign investors in the governing body of a public utility enterprise shall be limited to their proportionate share in its capital, and all the executive and managing officers of such corporation or association must be citizens of the Philippines.'** (underscoring supplied)\n\nPursuant to the Philippine Constitution, if the operation of the infrastructure or development facility requires a public utility franchise, the BOT Law requires that the project proponent must be a Filipino or a corporation registered with the SEC and owned up to a least 60% by Filipinos.\n\nPhilippine law does not provide an exact definition of a public utility. In the 1989 Supreme Court case of Albana v. Reyes (175 SCRA 264), 'public utility' was defined in a footnote only citing American Jurisprudence as follows:\n\nA 'public utility' is a business or service engaged in regularly supplying the public with some commodity or service of public consequence such as electricity, gas, water, transportation, telephone or telegraph service. Apart from statutes which define public utilities that are within the purview of such statutes, it would be difficult to construct a definition of a public utility which would fit every conceivable case. As its name indicates, however, the term public utility implies a public use and service to the public'\n\nThis means that the term 'public utility' may be subject to a broad interpretation. Other than utilities traditionally falling within the term public utility, it is not certain as to what activities fall within the term public utility.\n\nGenerally, the operations of the Project fall within the meaning of a public utility. Thus, foreign ownership of the Company is limited to 40% of its capital.\n\nThe Concession Agreement appears to imply that the Company will undertake both public utility activities and non-public utility activities.\n\nAlthough the leasing of space for the operations of retail outlets or restaurants or for putting up advertising signs, in the terminal, are not nationalized or partially nationalized activities, engaging in retail, restaurant or advertising business are covered by nationalization laws. The transportation business is also considered a public utility business.\n\nThe limitations on foreign equity in corporations engaging in these activities are as follows:\n\n\u25cf Operation and ownership of public utilities (up to 40% foreign equity allowed)m\n\n\u25cf Retail Trade (includes restaurant business) (no foreign equity allowed)m and\n\n\u25cf Advertising (up to 30% foreign equity allowed).\n\n**(b)**  **Anti-Dummy Law.**  **Commonwealth Act No. 108 (as amended by Presidential Decree No. 715), otherwise known as the 'Anti-Dummy Law' imposes criminal and civil penalties to those violating nationalization laws. The Anti-Dummy Law prohibits, among others, foreign nationals from:**\n\n**'interven(ing) in the management, operation, administration or control thereof, whether as an officer, employee or laborer therein with or without remuneration, except technical personnel whose employment may be specifically authorized by the Secretary of Justice'.**\n\n**In addition, the Anti-Dummy law provides that:**\n\n**'the election of aliens as members of the board of directors or governing body of corporations or associations engaging in partially-nationalized activities shall be allowed in proportion to their allowable participation or share in the capital of such entities'.**\n\n**As a public utility, the operations and ownership of the Company are also covered by the Anti-Dummy Law.**\n\n**This means that any arrangements with foreign nationals by the Company will have to be considered carefully. Foreign nationals may only be employed in technical positions after prior approval of the Secretary of Justice. All executive and management positions must be occupied by Filipino citizens.\"** (emphasis added)\n\n310.\n\nIn its Executive Summary of the same due diligence report, QT stated:\n\n\"1. The operation and ownership of a public utility is reserved by the Philippine Constitution to Filipino citizens or to domestic corporations owned at least 60% by Filipinos. This means that foreign nationals can only own a maximum of 40% of the capital of a public utility. The operations of the Company generally fall within the term 'public utility'. Thus, the direct equity investment of FAG together with the equity in the Company presently held by foreign nationals cannot exceed 40% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company. At present, the Company is owned 75% by Philippine nationals and 25% by foreign nationals.\n\n2. The Anti-Dummy Law prohibits foreign nationals from, among others, intervening in the management, operation, administration or control of a company engaged in a partially nationalized activity (e.g. a public utility) except as technical personnel with specific authority from the Secretary of the Department of Justice. Further the Philippine Constitution provides that all executive and management positions in a public utility company must be occupied by Filipino citizens. However, foreign nationals are entitled to such number of directors *[sic]* in the board of a public utility in proportion to their actual and allowable equity in the Company. **In view of the Anti-Dummy Law and the provisions of the Philippine Constitution, arrangements, other than mere equity investments between FAG and the Company, must be considered carefully.\"** (emphasis added)\n\n311.\n\nNine days later on 20 January 1999, the financial services firm of KPMG submitted to Fraport or FAG, as it was then known, a due diligence report on financial issues. In light of its extensive analysis, KPMG identified three alternatives for Fraport:\n\n\"Subject to the above milestone provisions, we believe that the following are the best alternatives open to FAG with regards to its role in NAIA Terminal 3:\n\n1. Invest in the project and simultaneously take on the responsibility as Master Concessionaire.\n\nConsidering that we believe the Project is generally viable, this would appear to be the ideal alternative available to FAG. As Master Concessionaire, FAG would have the access and authority to manage the operation to ensure that their best interests are taken into account as an investor because of the planned majority shareholding structure with PAGS and Pair Cargo. **More so considering that PIATCO does not possess the experience nor expertise to properly manage and coordinate the technical and commercial operations of an international airport terminal.**\n\nThe dual role of investor and Master Concessionaire would minimise any agency problems and costs associated with FAG coming in only as an investor, hence we have not offered the latter as an alternative. We believe that considering FAG's limited exposure in the Philippines taking a less active role than being actually part of the project as Master Concessionaire where it can readily protect its interests would not be prudent.\n\nIt should be noted, that at this time **we are not in a position to offer further advice particularly on the structuring of FAG's entry because this is beyond the confines of this engagement.**\n\nUpon entry, however, FAG should consider that PIATCO indicated that it would be heavily reliant on FAG as Master Concessionaire to realize the full potential of the Project upon operation. Consequently, the entry of FAG would require a substantial commitment of resources on a continuing basis covering not only the initial investment but other resources, such as funds and people, for its role as Master Concessionaire. **The resources would be used formulating concepts, strategies and a business plan in the pre-operational phase and to manage the new terminal in the operational period.**\n\nThis alternative offers 2 financial benefits - cash dividends and management fees. In terms of the latter, there is also significant potential for performance related compensation, should FAG desire to include such provisions in its contract as Master Concessionaire. In general terms, we believe that a fixed fee plus performance related compensation calculated on certain targets and milestones with full cost recovery would be an ideal structure. More definitive advice requires further study, which would fall under a separate engagement, as this would be beyond the current engagement scope.\n\n2. Enter only as the contracted Master Concessionaire in exchange for a management fee.\n\nWe believe that this would be the next best alternative, although it does offer a more limited potential for profitability. As Master Concessionaire, FAG would profit only in terms of receiving management fees for its services. **The inherent risk covering this alternative is that unless FAG secures sufficient authority and leverage from PIATCO to make necessary changes, modifications and orders to better ensure the successful** ***[sic]*** **of their role and subsequent tasks as Master Concessionaire FAG may not really capture the full benefits under this alternative.**\n\nUnless this is clarified and ensured at the outset, there is a significant potential for problems in meeting performance targets especially if certain FAG recommended facility specifications that are integral to successful airport terminal operations are not implemented. **If FAG believes that securing the necessary authority and leverage discussed above would be [a] problem, then only alternatives 1 and 3 should be considered.**\n\n3. Do not invest in the Project and do not assume role of Master Concessionaire for the new terminal.\n\nAlthough we believe that the Project is viable and has the good profit potential for its investors and participants, i.e. good chances of healthy performance related compensation, FAG always has this option if it feels that its expectations are not in the line with our findings.\" (emphasis added)\n\n312.\n\nThere is no indication in the record as to whether Fraport made the QT due diligence report available to KPMG.\n\n313.\n\nFraport's final report to its supervisory body of 26 February 1999 addressed the concerns of the KPMG report with respect to the preferred structuring of the investment from a financial perspective, but ignored the legal concerns which QT had expressed with respect to the ADL. The proposed arrangements set forth in Fraport's final report did not comply with the legal requirements of Philippine law which QT had spelled out. Indeed, Fraport did not mince words, as the underscored segment indicates:\n\nUnder Philippine law, the share of non-Philippine capital in PIATCO may not exceed 40%. Currently, 25% are in non-Philippine ownership, with only 10% being up for sale. This means that FAG can have a maximum direct share in PIATCO of 25% (nominally 63.75 million DM). This investment is written into the Sale Purchase Agreement.\n\nWithin PIATCO, all shareholders will enter into a Shareholder Agreement that will also define the management appointments, voting rights and provisions for the acquisition and sale of shares.\n\nAnother Shareholder Agreement between FAG, PAGS, Paircargo and PTI makes sure that the above-mentioned parties will hold a majority of 51% in PIATCO. It also establishes that FAG will be consulted in matters that represent its core competencies (retailing, terminal operation). **PAGS and Paircargo are willing to accept the professional advice of FAG in above-mentioned decisions as binding, which, however, cannot be enforced legally because of local laws. In order to reinforce this declaration of intent, the idea is for GlobeGround and FAG to conclude an additional agreement under German law making the provisions of the Shareholder Agreement binding on the mandate holders.**\n\nAfter the afore-mentioned transactions, PIATCO will only have a passive role, while the main activities will be controlled by PTI as concessionaire for operations and center management.\n\nAs a result of its direct investment in PIATCO of 25%, FAG will receive two seats on the Board out of eleven, and, as a result of the direct investment via PTI, it will receive two seats on the Board on behalf of PTI, one of which will be occupied by FAG. **Together with the mandates of PAGS and Paircargo, the consortium will have six seats on the Board of PIATCO.**\n\n**PIATCO will limit itself in the future to oversee compliance with all agreements and the agreement with the Government.** The entire project management will be assigned to PTI, i.e. PTI will plan, build and operate the terminal. **We have a joint 51% share in PIATCO via our partnership with PAGS and Paircargo. According to the agreements FAG will have financial and operating control over the project.**\n\nAccording to the agreements, **FAG will assume the management function together with PAGS/GlobeGround** (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 for the following comments). In terms of dividing up the business, PAGS/GlobeGround will be responsible for anything to do with local dealings and **FAG will be responsible for anything to do with the airport.** The partners will be given the right to make proposals for management positions based on their respective responsibilities. The shareholders of PAGS have decided that GlobeGround V DLH will handle PAGS' management positions.\" (emphasis added)\n\n314.\n\nPreviously, on 19 January 1999, the PIATCO Master Concession Concept Brief had made the arrangement explicit:\n\n\"In compliance with the requirements of Asian Development Bank and Export-Import Bank of Japan (Senior Lenders), PIATCO intends to appoint a Master Concessionaire (MC) which will be an entity controlled by an internationally-known airport terminal operator with proven recent experience in managing international airport terminals at least of the size and with the full management scope described herein. At this point, PIATCO is looking to Flughafen Frankfurt Main AG (FAG) to be the international airport terminal operator.\n\nThe MC may be a joint venture consisting of FAG and a Filipino company. The ratio of national to foreign participation should be in accordance with Philippine laws. **A shareholders agreement will have to secure the actual control by** **FAG as may be allowed by Philippine laws. Actual control refers to full executive and management control by FAG. This requirement of actual control must be backed up by an undertaking from the shareholders of the MC in favor of PIATCO and Senior Lenders so that PIATCO and Senior Lenders can enforce such requirements. Changes to the shareholders agreement relating to FAG's exercise of actual control of the MC will require PIATCO's consent. FAG will be expected to guarantee the performance in all respects of the functions to be carried out by the Master Concessionaire.\"** (emphasis added)\n\n315.\n\nFraport's Supervisory Board, which was charged with making the decision of whether to proceed with the project, was fully aware of the inconsistency of the proposed arrangements with Philippine law. In a document dated 7 March 1999, *i.e.* before its decision was taken, Dr. Werner Schmidt, a member of the Board wrote (\"Comments on Investing in the Consortium for the Construction and Operation of Terminal 3 in Manila, Philippines\" (Meeting of the Supervisory Board re Agenda Item 8 on March 12, 1999)):\n\n\"A. Control of the Consortium of Companies by FAG\n\nThe documents show that an actual majority shareholding by FAG is to be reached by investment in various nested equity interests and the granting of a shareholder loan to PAGS against a subordinate collateral. In fact, **FAG's equity interest shall total 64%. A 'control agreement' shall ensure that FAG exercises control over the enterprise.**\n\nThis is also absolutely necessary since KPMG points out repeatedly that the current owners are not in a position to ensure the proper operation of the airport.\n\n**In fact, however, such control is not practicable for legal reasons, as PIATCO's legal due diligence states the following: 'Foreign citizens are prohibited from intervening in the management, operation or control of the company...'. Moreover, the summary of the agreements contains the statement that 'a decisive voting right of FAG would violate the anti-dummy law of the Philippines'.**\n\n*Consequently,*  ***FAG cannot legally enforce its intended leadership in this***  *consortium.* This, however, is the most important prerequisite for the entire transaction.\" (emphasis added)\n\n316.\n\nLike the QT due diligence report, Werner Schmidt's comments were ignored. Indeed, the legal problem to which he drew attention appears to have been ignored from the very outset; those concerned with designing the architecture of the Terminal 3 project always assumed, as did KPMG, that Fraport's effective control of the project was vital for its success. In a letter dated 18 December 1998 from the Chairman and President of Fraport to a senior investment officer in ADB, *i.e.* one of the Senior Lenders, Fraport's Chairman had summarized discussions with ADB as follows:\n\n\"(i) Single point operator for both airside and landside which is currently envisioned to be a company made up of FAG, Paircargo and PAGS ('FPP'). This company will be a 60/40 Filipino company in accordance with the requirements of Philippine Law.\n\n(ii) **Within the FPP, FAG will have effective control and responsibility for the performance of the master concessionaire.\"** (emphasis added)\n\n317.\n\nSimilarly, on 19 January 1999, Jesse Ang, then CFO of PIATCO, had written to John Archer, Department Head, Product, Marketing and Consulting of FAG, as Fraport was then named, referring to \"the percentage ownership of FAG within FPP and the **manner in which FAG will assume and retain effective control\"** (emphasis added). But the attached Concept Brief elaborated that \"[a] shareholders agreement will have to secure the actual control by FAG **as may be allowed by Philippine laws\"** (emphasis added).\n\n318.\n\nMr. Ang's letter referred to what was allowed by Philippine law. The problem was that the actual control and management that a Senior Lender, KPMG and Fraport's Supervisory Board understood to be necessary for the success of the investment was not compatible with the ADL, as QT had explained to Fraport.\n\n319.\n\nFraport proceeded to deal with this problem by implementing the strategy described in its confidential documents of concluding secret shareholder agreements that circumvented the relevant Philippine law. A confidential shareholders agreement between it, Paircargo, PAGS and PTI, concluded on 6 July 1999, characterized by the Respondent as the \"Control Agreement\" or \"Pooling Agreement\", provided in Article 2.02:\n\n\"2.02 The Shareholders' or their directors' vote shall be determined in accordance with the following rules:\n\n(1) Within a reasonable time prior to the date set for a stockholders' or board meeting, the Shareholders shall have their own preliminary meeting for the purpose of extensive discussions and deliberations on the matters to be put to a vote. During the preliminary meeting, the Shareholders shall thoroughly discuss all the possible consequences of an affirmative and of a negative note, with a view to arriving at a unanimous vote. The position of each Shareholder during the preliminary meeting shall be given equal weight (i.e., FAG, PAIRCARGO, PAGS and PTI shall have one vote each).\n\n**(2) In case the Shareholders are unable to reach a common position,**\n\n**(a) The Shareholders shall consult FAG and FAG may make recommendations in relation to any of the following matters (which matters fall within FAG's area of expertise and competence):**\n\n**(i) the implementation of the O&M Agreement, as executed;**\n\n**(ii) the operation, maintenance and management of the Terminal Complex;**\n\n**(iii) the conduct of commercial operations within the Terminal Complex in the ordinary course of business.**\n\n**The Shareholders shall thereafter act upon the recommendations of FAG.**\n\n(b) in all other matters not covered by (a) above, the issue shall be submitted to the respective boards of directors of the Shareholders for further independent deliberations. If the position taken by the boards of directors is not unanimous, unless the Shareholders thereafter agree to postpone any action on the matter, the issue shall be submitted for resolution by three (3) arbitrators appointed under and acting pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. Arbitration shall be for the purpose of determining the course of action most favorable to the interests of the Shareholders and most consistent with Article 1.02. The place of arbitration shall be Singapore and the language of arbitration shall be English. Arbitration shall be concluded within sixty (60) days from submission.\n\nThe following, without limitation, shall be deemed matters not covered by (a) above: the amendment of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation or By-laws; the amendment of the PIATCO Shareholders' Agreement; the dividend policy of the Corporation a public offering of the shares of stock of the Corporation the election of directors, the appointment of officers; the formation of committees and their composition the appointment of and entering into contracts with consultants, advisers and external auditors; the maintenance of corporate accounts; the designation of authorized representatives and check signatories; the conduct of business outside the Terminal Complex, such as hotels, convention centers and jewelry manufacturing; relations with GRP in matters not falling under (a) above.\" (emphasis added)\n\n320.\n\nUnder Article 1.07 of the above-quoted FAG-PAIRCARGO-PAGS-PTI Shareholders' Agreement, strict confidentiality was undertaken:\n\n**\"1.07 The Shareholders shall keep the terms and conditions of this Agreement strictly confidential and undertake not to disclose the contents hereof to any third party without the prior written consent of the other Shareholders, except to the extent necessary in order to perform their obligations hereunder or to enforce the provisions hereof.\"** (emphasis added)\n\n321.\n\nA second relevant agreement was the Addendum to the PIATCO Shareholders' Agreement of 6 July 1999. Article 9 of the Addendum gave \"exclusive authority\" to Fraport as finance arranger:\n\n**\"Notwithstanding any provision in the Shareholders Agreement to the contrary, FAG shall be the finance arranger for the Project and shall have the exclusive authority** to determine the financial arrangements for the Project, if necessary, including the nomination of the Company's financial advisers, on terms and conditions not disadvantageous to the Company. Articles 7.1.2, 7.1.4 and 8.1.18 shall not be construed to include and shall not apply to the financial arrangements to be undertaken or arranged by FAG for the Company. FAG hereby undertakes to obtain debt financing for the Project from third party Project Lenders and undertakes to work for a successful financial closing. However, FAG shall not be responsible for any event or circumstance beyond its control. FAG acknowledges the fact that the Company has, to date, expended substantial sums of money in an effort to obtain a successful debt financing from international financial institutions.\" (emphasis added)\n\n322.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this agreement, while it does not contain a confidentiality clause, was only produced to the Tribunal in January 2006 during the hearing on jurisdiction and liability, at the President's request and insistence.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal need not refer to the other secret agreements which were only discovered in January 200623. Indeed, the above-quoted agreements and, in addition, the Claimant's own internal documents show that Fraport was consciously, intentionally and covertly structuring its investment in a way which it knew to be a violation of the ADL. Fraport's equity investment in terms of the statutorily limited percentage in the Terminal 3 project was lawful under Philippine law. Fraport's controlling and managing the investment was not. Despite having been advised and plainly understanding this, Fraport secretly designed its investment in the project so as to have that prohibited management and control, in particular by reserving to itself the ultimate authority as a shareholder in PIATCO to decide those matters set out in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of Article 2.02 (2) (a) of the FAG-PAIRCARGO-PAGS-PTI Shareholders' Agreement of 6 July 1999.\n\nThese secret shareholder agreements include a shareholders' agreement amongst PTH Inc. and FAG dated 6 July 1999, as well as a shareholders' agreement amongst PAGS and FAG of the same date.\n\n324.\n\nIn a meeting on 14 December 1999, Herr Vogel posed a number of questions to QT, once again indicating Fraport's awareness of a concern about violations of the ADL. A week later, in a letter of 21 December 1999, the law firm of QT responded. QT stated the question posed to it as follows (at page 1):\n\n\"We understand that together with SB Capital Investment Corporation ('SB Capital') and using appropriate legal structures/vehicles, FAG is contemplating acquiring 26% of PIATCO. FAG currently directly owns 25% of PIATCO. We understand that other foreign shareholders, namely Chuan Hup Incorporated ('Chuan Hup') and Nissho Iwai Corporation ('Nissho Iwai') own 10% and 5% of PIATCO respectively. Chuan Hup may be selling its 5% of PIATCO. We further understand that the other 21% will be purchased from the other shareholders.\n\n16. You inquire in respect of the following:\n\n1. To what possible extent may foreigners assume positions in public utility companies?\"\n\n325.\n\nQT, in answering the first question, reviewed the relevant Philippine constitutional law and then stated (at page 3-4):\n\n**\"However, the constitutional provision should be read in conjunction with the Anti-Dummy Law which appears to contain a more rigid prohibition in respect to alien employment in public utility companies. Under the AntiDummy Law, in respect of nationalized and partially nationalized activities, foreign nationals are prohibited from intervening in the management, operation, administration or control of the business,** ***whether as an officer, employee or laborer,*** **with or without remuneration, except:**\n\n**a. technical personnel whose employment may be specifically authorized by the Secretary of Justice; and**\n\n**b. as members of the board of directors of the corporation in proportion to their actual and allowable equity participation.**\n\nIn this regard the Supreme Court has held in the case of *King v. Hernaez (4 SCRA 792)* that the words 'management, operation, administration and control,' followed by the words 'whether as an officer, employee or laborer' in the nationalized or partially nationalized business enterprise signify that the employment of a person who is not a Filipino citizen even in a minor or clerical or non-control position is prohibited.\n\nBased on the foregoing, **it appears that aside from holding positions in PIATCO's board of directors in proportion to its share in PIATCO's equity,**\n\n**FAG's representatives can only be appointed to technical positions in PIATCO's enterprise, upon prior approval by the Secretary of Justice.**\n\nIncluded among the allowable positions is that of Chairman of the Board of Directors because, generally, the Chairman is the head of the board of directors.\n\nIn respect of technical personnel in public utility companies, the Department of Justice (\"DO\"x) has held that the criteria used by the DOX in granting specific authorization to employ alien \"technical personnel\" in a nationalized business or activity are: whether the position sought to be filled is technical in nature, taking into consideration the duties involved therein, and whether the applicant possesses the required qualifications. In this connection, it may be stressed that DOX, in construing the term \"technical personnel\" to determine whether it applies to a given situation usually refers the application for employment of technical personnel in partly nationalized undertakings to the government office that exercises supervision over the employing corporation for its comment and recommendation (DOX Opinion No. 120, dated 30 June 1982). Thus, if FAG would like to have representatives appointed to positions outside of PIATCO's board of directors, the employment of these representatives would have *[sic]* authorized by the DOX as technical personnel. The DOX will likely refer this matter for recommendation by the Department of Transportation and Communications.\" (emphasis added)\n\n326.\n\nThe preliminary meeting required in Article 2.02 (1) of the FAG-PAIRCARGO- PAGS-PTI Shareholders' Agreement of 6 July 1999, which ensured Fraport's control over the items specified in Article 2.02 (2) thereof, was not consistent with the ADL. The actual board meeting in which the other shareholders were obliged to act in accordance with the confidential preliminary meeting was no more than a rubber stamp of \"the recommendations of FAG\". The confidentiality clause contained in this shareholder agreement indicates that Fraport's strategy was to conceal its illegal control from the Philippine authorities.\n\n327.\n\nIn summary, Fraport had been fully advised and was fully aware of the ADL and the incompatibility with the ADL of the structure of its investment which it planned and ultimately put into place with the secret shareholder agreements.\n\n328.\n\nThe Claimant had opportunities to provide an explanation in this regard during the hearing. The relevant part of the cross-examination on 10 January 2006 of Mr. Bender, Chairman of Fraport's Executive Board, follows:\n\n\"1320\n\n0,693275462962963\n\n5 Q. Sir, let me ask you another question based\n\n6 on that same paragraph on page 5, the third bullet\n\n7 point.\n\n8 Do you see, sir, the sentence there that\n\n9 states, PAGS and Paircargo are willing to accept\n\n10 the professional advice of Fraport in\n\n11 above-mentioned decisions as binding which,\n\n12 however, cannot be enforced legally because of\n\n13 local laws?\n\n14 Do you see that section, sir?\n\n15 A. Yes, I see it.\n\n16 Q. So, sir, in fact, Fraport, PAGS,\n\n17 Paircargo, and PTI were agreeing to certain\n\n18 provisions that were not enforceable legally under\n\n19 Philippines law; correct?\n\n20 A. No. That is not correct because if I see\n\n21 this correctly, this dates back to February 26,\n\n22 '99, and only after that we received counsel by the\n\n1321\n\n0,694155092592593\n\n1 Philippines attorneys, and then all the agreements\n\n2 that were entered into were then based on the legal\n\n3 advice that we received, and for that reason this\n\n4 is not an agreement, but this is just the way the\n\n5 considerations were in February of 1999, and later\n\n6 on the agreements, of course, were reworded and\n\n7 rephrased.\n\n8 Q. Sir, at this point in time, in this\n\n9 document, executives of Fraport were proposing that\n\n10 Fraport enter into an agreement that it knew was\n\n11 not enforceable legally under Philippines law;\n\n12 correct?\n\n13 A. No, that is an erroneous quote. This part\n\n14 of this sentence, however, cannot be enforced\n\n15 legally because of local law.\n\n16 Q. Is that an accurate statement in this\n\n17 document?\n\n18 A. Yes, I just quoted from this document.\n\n19 Q. And that was your understanding of the\n\n20 situation at this point in time, in March of 1999?\n\n21 A. Yes. This was in February of '99, by the\n\n22 way, not in March, and that was the state of the\n\n1322\n\n0,695277777777778\n\n1 considerations at that point in time, and it was\n\n2 clear that there is an Anti-Dummy Law imposing\n\n3 certain restrictions in terms of the rights of the\n\n4 Fraport AG, and then based on counsel's advice,\n\n5 which we didn't have at that point in time, but\n\n6 received later on. Based on counsel's advice, then\n\n7 we worded the agreements to be in accordance and in\n\n8 agreement with Filipino law.\n\n9 Q. Sir, you referred a couple of times to\n\n10 advice under Philippines law in connection with\n\n11 these terms. Have you ever seen any written\n\n12 Philippine law opinions with regard to those terms?\n\n13 A. I don't remember exactly, but I don't\n\n14 think so that I have seen that, but they reported\n\n15 our project managers and the employees responsible\n\n16 for the project reported to the executive board\n\n17 that the contracts are in line with the Philippine\n\n18 law, and also told us that we had this advice by QT\n\n19 law firm.\"\n\n329.\n\nNo document from the firm of QT supporting the above-quoted statement that the secret shareholder agreements at issue were \"in line with the Philippine law\" is to be found in the extensive record of this arbitration. The documents which were produced to the Tribunal, all of which emanate from Fraport, contradict this statement insofar as they were even responsive to the questions posed. It seems that the Republic of the Philippines is factually correct in its Post-Hearing Memorandum when it says \"[n]ot only is there is no evidence of any counsel's review of the shareholder agreements in 1999, the record shows that every Philippine lawyer who looked at Fraport's shareholder agreements after that time advised that they violated the Anti-Dummy Law\".\n\n330.\n\nIn 2001, as noted earlier, Fraport, anxious to secure a loan from a consortium, referred to as the Senior Lenders, which would reduce its own financial exposure, was again advised, this time by legal counsel for the Senior Lenders, of the incompatibility of its arrangements with the ADL. The due diligence report of the law firm of SyCip, which was not produced to the Tribunal, is, however, referred to in the email traffic between officials of Fraport which is part of the record before the Tribunal. Thus every legal due diligence report with respect to the way that Fraport had elected to structure its investment in PIATCO confirmed that it was in violation of the ADL and thus in violation of Philippine law.\n\n331.\n\nOn 2 June 2001, after the SyCip report, Mr. Bernd Struck, Fraport's Executive Vice President, wrote a stern letter to QT:\n\n\"Having received your report of the meeting held with the counsel of the Senior Lenders, I am deeply concerned about the way, how the position of Fraport in the NAIA IPT III Project is threatened by issues under the Anti Dummy Law. The same is true in relation to the Second Addendum, where we had discussed the Anti Dummy Law issues extensively before we learned that the nomination rights structure already adopted on the level of PIATCO and on the level of PTI might constitute a breach of the Anti Dummy Law.\n\nFraport is a foreign investor and cannot be familiar with the Philippine laws and regulations. We have to rely on the legal advice obtained on the Philippines and in particular from your distinguished law firm. Large parts of the contractual structure of our investment have been crafted by your distinguished firm, and the amounts at risk are paramount if something goes wrong because of a possible non-compliance with the local law.\n\nWe therefore expect that the advice obtained from your firm is consistent and provides us with a firm legal basis which enables you and us to defend the structures created against any attack from whatever side. If you find out that certain contemplated structures are not, or may not be, in line with Philippine law, we wish that you warn us early enough, and that you advise us early enough on safe alternatives to achieve our goals. Please understand that it is not acceptable for us if resolutions which have been adopted, and which have been prepared by you, are questioned thereafter, or if contractual structures on which you have advised are questioned by the Senior Lenders or any other party without being vigorously defended by you against any attack whatsoever.\n\nPlease make sure that Quisumbing Torres is represented by partners familiar with our Project and the contracts concluded in relation thereto during all upcoming discussions with the Senior Lenders' counsels, and I would very much appreciate your personal attendance during these meetings.\n\nPlease make also sure that whoever will join these meetings shall have all necessary information and shall defend vigorously the legality of the agreements entered into during the course of this Project.\"\n\n332.\n\nWhatever Mr. Struck's *personal* knowledge may have been, considering the documents which have been excerpted in the previous pages of this Award and, in particular, Werner Schmidt's statement to Fraport's Supervisory Board when it was considering the investment, the Tribunal cannot see how the highest executive levels of Fraport can evade their own responsibility and attribute responsibility for its problems to a mistake of QT, some obscurity on this point in Philippine law, or Fraport's misunderstanding of QT's warning. It is especially difficult to see how the highest executive levels of Fraport can plausibly claim not to have been aware of the advice previously given and confirmed in the communication of Werner Schmidt regarding the incompatibility of the arrangements that Fraport had concluded with PIATCO with the legal requirements of the Philippines. The Tribunal is persuaded from Fraport's own internal and contemporaneous documents that it was consistently aware that the way it was structuring its investment in the Philippines was in violation of the ADL and accordingly sought to keep those arrangements secret.\n\n333.\n\nWhile this factual record is troubling, it does not *eo ipso* mean that the Tribunal is without jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to hear the substance of the claim. The Tribunal's task is to make this determination in accordance with applicable legal standards, which are considered next.\n\n**C. The Applicable Legal Standards**\n-------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nAs observed earlier, the BIT at issue in this arbitration has a jurisdictional limitation *ratione materiae* to which the Tribunal now turns.\n\n335.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT provides that for the purpose of this Agreement \"[t]he term investment' shall mean any kind of asset accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State [...]\". The qualification \"accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State\" applies to every form of investment covered by the BIT. Article 2(1) provides:\n\n\"Each Contracting State shall promote as far as possible investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting State and admit such investments in accordance with its Constitution, laws and regulations as referred to Article 1, paragraph 1. [...]\"\n\n336.\n\nThe Protocol to the Agreement, which was concluded on the same day as the BIT, states in reference to ad Article 2:\n\n\"As provided for in the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, foreign investors are not allowed to own land in the territory of the Republic of the Philippines. However investors are allowed to own up to 40% of the equity of a company which can then acquire ownership of land.\"\n\n337.\n\nThe Republic's Instrument of Ratification, which was exchanged with Germany on 10 July 1997, provided:\n\n**\"KNOW YE,** that whereas, the Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the Federal Republic of Germany for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments was signed in Bonn on 18 April 1997;\n\n**WHEREAS,** the Agreement, consisting of eleven (11) Articles, seeks to promote, protect and create a favorable condition for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party based on the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit;\n\n**WHEREAS, the Agreement provides that the investment shall be in the areas allowed by and in accordance with the Constitutions, laws and regulations of each of the Contracting Parties;**\n\n**WHEREAS,** the Agreement also provides for the free transfer of investments and returns thereto out of the Contracting Parties territories;\n\nWHEREAS, Article 11 of the Agreement provides that it shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the date of exchange of the German instrument of ratification and the Philippine notification of approval;\n\n**NOW, THEREFORE,** be it known that **I, FIDEL V. RAMOS,** President of the Republic of the Philippines, after having seen and considered the aforementioned Agreement Between the Republic of the Philippines and the Federal Republic of Germany for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, do hereby ratify and confirm the same and each and every Article and Clause thereof.\n\nIN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the Republic of the Philippines to be affixed.\" (emphasis added)\n\n338.\n\nBecause the exchange of instruments of ratification puts a treaty into effect in accordance with its terms, the second preambular paragraph emphasized above is particularly important in regard to the issue at bar.\n\n339.\n\nWhile all of these provisions are manifestly limitations *ratione materiae,* their interpretation is not simple. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties enjoins interpretation of particular provisions in their context, *i.e.* with reference to the rest of the treaty and in the light of its objects and purposes. The fact that there are three explicit references in the total of 16 provisions in the Treaty and Protocol plus an additional reference in the Instrument of Ratification, which selected only four items in the treaty deemed so important to the Philippines as to require additional recitation, indicates the significance of this condition. The parties had in mind explicit constitutional limitations in the Philippines. Article 2 of the Protocol as well as the Instrument of Ratification make that clear beyond peradventure of doubt.\n\n340.\n\nIt is also clear that the parties were anxious to encourage investment, which was the *raison d'etre* of the treaty. But while a treaty should be interpreted in the light of its objects and purposes, it would be a violation of all the canons of interpretation to pretend to use its objects and purposes, which are, by their nature, a deduction on the part of the interpreter, to nullify four explicit provisions. Plainly, as indicated by these four provisions, economic transactions undertaken by a national of one of the parties to the BIT had to meet certain legal requirements of the host state in order to qualify as an \"investment\" and fall under the Treaty.\n\n341.\n\nThere are some linguistic differences between the provisions. In the equally authentic German version of the Treaty, the same verb \"zulassen\" is used in both Article 1 and Article 2, while the English version uses two different verbs: \"accept\" and \"admit\" in Articles 1 and 2, respectively. Article 1(1) refers to investments \"accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State\". Article 2(1) obliges each state to \"admit such investments in accordance with its Constitution, laws and regulations as referred to in Article 1, paragraph 1\". The Instrument of Ratification states that \"[t]he Agreement provides that the investment shall be in the areas allowed by and in accordance with the Constitutions, laws and regulations of each of the Contracting Parties\".\n\n342.\n\nBut lest any difference be inferred from the use of two different verbs in the English version, the Tribunal would note that the chapeau of Article 2 is \"Promotion and Acceptance\" and \"acceptance\" is the verb used in Article 1 (the chapeau of Article 1 is \"Definition of Terms\".). Thus, this linguistic difference does not appear to indicate an intentional nuance and hence to be legally significant. Article 2 refers to the Constitution, as well as laws and regulations; Article 1 uses a generic reference to laws and regulations. Here again, the difference does not appear significant. The Instrument of Ratification of the Philippines which is only in English does not include the word \"acceptance\" but simply requires that investments be \"in the areas allowed by and in accordance with [...]\".\n\n343.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two types of international investments. The first is comprised of an investment based on or accompanied by some explicit agreement with or unilateral communication from the host state24; the second involves an investment in the market of the host state without an accompanying specific agreement between the investor and the government of the host state. The English version of the BIT might be read as applying Articles 1(1) and 2(1) only to the first type of investment. But such a construction would seem unreasonable and even doubtful for a number of reasons. First, it is unlikely that state parties would insist on compliance with their respective constitutions, laws and regulations only with respect to the first type of investment but would, at the same time, discharge potential investors from such compliance with respect to the quite common type of investments in the second category. Second, ad Article 2 of the Protocol, which elaborates Article 2 of the Treaty, relates to purchasing shares in a company which might then acquire land in the territory of the Republic. The acquisition of shares by a foreign investor in a domestic corporation is a legal transaction that does not, by its nature, involve some action by the government involving acceptance or permission. Third, the Instrument of Ratification uses a comprehensive formulation: \"the investment shall be in the areas allowed by and in accordance with [...]\". So it would appear that the material restrictions on investments relate both to investments of the first and second types.\n\n\"The Question of Unilateral Governmental Statements as Applicable Law in Investment Disputes\" by W. Michael Reisman and Mahnoush H. Arsanjani, 19:2 1CSID Review 328 (2004).\n\n344.\n\nWith respect to the temporal extension of the condition in the relevant provisions of the BIT, it has been contended by the Respondent and some of its experts that an investment, in order to maintain jurisdictional standing under the BIT, must not only be \"in accordance\" with relevant domestic law at the time of commencement of the investment but must continuously remain in compliance with domestic law, such that a departure from some laws or regulations in the course of the operation of the BIT would deprive a tribunal under the BIT of jurisdiction.\n\n345.\n\nAlthough this contention is not relevant to the analysis of the problem which the Tribunal has before it, namely the *entry* of the investment and not the way it was subsequently conducted, the Tribunal would note that this part of the Respondent's interpretation appears to be a forced construction of the pertinent provisions in the context of the entire Treaty. The language of both Articles 1 and 2 of the BIT emphasizes the *initiation* of the investment. Moreover the effective operation of the BIT regime would appear to require that jurisdictional compliance be limited to the initiation of the investment. If, at the time of the initiation of the investment, there has been compliance with the law of the host state, allegations by the host state of violations of its law in the course of the investment, as a justification for state action with respect to the investment, might be a defense to claimed *substantive* violations of the BIT, but could not deprive a tribunal acting under the authority of the BIT of its jurisdiction.\n\n346.\n\nThere is, however, the question of estoppel. Principles of fairness should require a tribunal to hold a government estopped from raising violations of its own law as a jurisdictional defense when it knowingly overlooked them and endorsed an investment which was not in compliance with its law.\n\n347.\n\nBut a covert arrangement, which by its nature is unknown to the government officials who may have given approbation to the project, cannot be any basis for estoppel: the covert character of the arrangement would deprive any legal validity (assuming that informal and possibly *contra legem* endorsements would have legal validity under the relevant law) that an expression of approbation or an endorsement might otherwise have had. There is no indication in the record that the Republic of the Philippines knew, should have known or could have known of the covert arrangements which were not in accordance with Philippine law when Fraport first made its investment in 1999.\n\n348.\n\nHaving set forth the legal standards applicable to its jurisdictional analysis, the Tribunal now turns to its interpretation of the ADL.\n\n**D. The Tribunal's Interpretation of the ADL**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nWhile the relevant provisions of the ADL have been set out earlier in this chapter, the Tribunal deems it useful to reproduce here, *in extenso,* Commonwealth Act No. 108, entitled An Act to Punish Acts of Evasion of the Laws on the Nationalization of Certain Rights, Franchises or Privileges, commonly known as the Anti-Dummy Law:\n\n\"SEC. 1. In all cases in which any constitutional or legal provision requires Philippine or any other specific citizenship as a requisite for the exercise or enjoyment of a right, franchise or privilege, any citizen of the Philippines or any other specific country who allows his name or citizenship to be used for the purpose of evading such provision, and any alien or foreigner profiting thereby, shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than five nor more than fifteen years, and by a fine of not less than the value of the right, franchise or privilege, which is enjoyed or acquired in violation of the provisions hereof but in no case less than five thousand pesos.\n\nThe fact that the citizen of the Philippines or of any specific country charged with a violation of this Act had, at the time of the acquisition of his holdings in the corporations or associations referred to in section two of this Act, no real or personal property, credit or other assets the value of which shall at least be equivalent to said holdings, shall be evidence of a violation of this Act.\n\nSEC. 2. In all cases in which a constitutional or legal provision requires that, in order that a corporation or association may exercise or enjoy a right, franchise or privilege, not less than a certain per centum of its capital must be owned by citizens of the Philippines or of any other specific country, it shall be unlawful to falsely stimulate the existence of such minimum of stock or capital as owned by such citizens, for the purpose of evading said provision. The president or managers and directors or trustees of corporations or associations convicted of a violation of this section shall be punished by imprisonment of not less than five nor more than fifteen years, and by a fine of not less than the value of the right.\n\nSEC. 2-A. **Any person, corporation, or association, which having in its name or under its control, a right, franchise, privilege, property or business, the exercise or enjoyment of which is expressly reserved by the Constitution or the laws to citizens of the Philippines or of any other specific country, or to corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by such citizens, permits or allows the use, exploitation or enjoyment thereof by a person, corporation or association not possessing the requisites prescribed by the Constitution or the laws of the Philippines;** or leases, or in any other way, transfers or conveys said right, franchise, privilege, property or business to a person, corporation or association not otherwise qualified under the Constitution, or the provisions of the existing laws; **or in any manner permits or allows any person, not possessing the qualifications required by the Constitution, or existing laws to acquire, use, exploit or enjoy a right, franchise, privilege, property or business, the exercise and enjoyment of which are expressly reserved by the Constitution or existing laws to citizens of the Philippines or of any other specific country, to intervene in the management, operation, administration or control thereof, whether as an officer, employee or laborer therein with or without remuneration except technical personnel whose employment may be specifically authorized by the Secretary of Justice, and any person who knowingly aids, assists, or abets in the planning, consummation or perpetration of any of the acts herein above enumerated** shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than five nor more than fifteen years and by a fine of not less than the value of the right, franchise or privilege enjoyed or acquired in violation of the provisions hereof but in no case less than five thousand pesos: *Provided, however,* That the president, managers or persons in charge of corporations, associations or partnerships violating the provisions of this section shall be criminally liable in lieu thereof: *Provided, further,* That any person, corporation or association shall, in addition to the penalty imposed herein, forfeit such right, franchise, privilege and the property provisions of this Act: And *Provided, finally,* That the election of aliens as members of the board of directors or governing body of corporations or associations engaging in partially nationalized activities shall he allowed in proportion to their allowable participation or share in the capital of such entities.\" (emphasis added)\n\nThe Tribunal need hardly add that statutory interpretations are never to be made in hypothetical legislative vacuums. Each interpretation must be made in the light of the Constitution and the ensemble of legislation of which a particular statute is a part.\n\n350.\n\nThe issue upon which the Tribunal focuses in connection with the ADL is *not* to be found in the fact that Fraport may have exceeded the statutorily determined level of equity investment lawfully permitted to a foreign investor in a constitutionally defined category of public utilities. In the view of the Tribunal, Fraport did not. Nor did Fraport violate the \"in accordance\" requirement of the BIT in that it may have loaned \"too\" much money to the public utility in question. Neither of these actions, both essentially quantitative, translates *per se* into managerial control over a modern corporation. But the FAG-PAIRCARGO-PAGS-PTI Shareholders' Agreement of 6 July 1999, set forth earlier in this Award, does.\n\n351.\n\nThat agreement makes the preliminary meeting of the shareholders the moment of actual decision: the board meeting that follows it simply endorses the outcomes. At the preliminary meeting, two things which sound in the ADL happen: first, the actual voting weight according to the percentage of shares held (which is subject to a statutory cap under Philippine law) is ignored and replaced by an equalization of the voting power of each of the shareholders (\"The position of each Shareholder during the preliminary meeting shall be given equal weight *(i.e.,* FAG, PAIRCARGO, PAGS and PTI shall have one vote each).)\". Second, even then, if the shareholders do not agree, Fraport's view is controlling with respect to the matters itemized in Article 2.02 (2). In short, for those items, Fraport secures *managerial* control in violation of the ADL.\n\n352.\n\nIt is clear from the texts of the ADL, as confirmed by the QT due diligence report, that it was *managerial* control which was the concern of the Constitution and the ADL; quantitative findings such as the percentage of equity investment were simply \"significant indicators\" or \"badges\" as Philippine law puts it25. In terms of quantitative findings, Fraport is correct that the Republic's relaxation of the quantitative test was especially clear after the abrogation of the \"Grandfather Rule\" for computing, for ADL purposes, the percentage of foreign equity (which seemed to create a strong legal presumption) and the adoption of the so-called \"Control Rule\". The \"Control Rule\", the shorthand reference in Philippine law for the replacement of the Grandfather Rule, is a misleading rubric, for it does not involve an empirical examination to determine whether a foreign investor actually exercises managerial control. It simply uses a more lenient non-cumulative quantitative test for computing the permissible equity ceiling and does not turn the new quantitative test into an irrebuttable presumption, as might have been inferred from Department of Justice Opinion No. 165.\n\nDepartment of Justice Opinion No. 165, Series of 1984.\n\n353.\n\nNothing in the record even suggests that the relaxation of the quantitative test of the Grandfather Rule by the introduction of the more lenient Control Rule can be interpreted to mean that the relevant constitutional provision and the ADL prohibiting managerial control ceased to be applicable. None of the lawyers consulted by Fraport in the various due diligences it commissioned assumed that the constitutional provision and the ADL had lapsed by operation of desuetude. Quite the contrary. Nor is there anything in the National Bureau of Investigation (\"NBI\") or DOX documents, *i.e.* the record established as part of the ADL proceedings, to which the Tribunal will turn below, to suggest that the agencies of the Philippine Government hold that view.\n\n354.\n\nUnder Philippine law, there are two ways of establishing an ADL violation:\n\n*first,* a quantitative test (whether the numerical threshold applied is the cumulative one in the Grandfather Rule or the non-cumulative one in the Control Rule), which, if violated, leads to a *praesumptio juris;* or\n\n*second,* an actual demonstration of managerial control, in which case the quantum of equity in the company is irrelevant.\n\nIn other words, if a foreign investor owned, let us say, 15% of the equity of a public utility, but had secret managerial and control agreements with the Philippine component, that would constitute a violation of the ADL.\n\n355.\n\nThe first way is only a means of inferring the second way. The only relevant change in Philippine law was with respect to the quantitative way of establishing a violation, *i.e.* replacing the cumulative computational formula of the Grandfather Rule with the more generous, non-cumulative formula of the Control Rule. The Tribunal's concern here is not with Fraport's quantitative equity; it is with the secret shareholder agreements. In the context of the internal Fraport documents, the secret shareholder agreements show that Fraport from the outset understood, with precision, the Philippine legal prohibition but believed that if it complied with it, the prospective investment could not be profitable. So it elected to proceed with the investment by secretly violating Philippine law through the secret shareholder agreements. These agreements evidence that Fraport planned and knew that its investment was not \"in accordance\" with Philippine law.\n\n356.\n\nIt is correct that Fraport's real modality of intervention in \"the management, operation, administration or control\" of PIATCO for the items specified in the FAG- PAIRCARGO-PAGS-PTI Shareholders' Agreement is as a shareholder in the confidential but binding preliminary meeting described at Article 2.02 thereof. Fraport does not, as the ADL specifies, intervene \"as an officer, employee or laborer\" in the subsequent formal board meeting that rubber-stamps the result of the confidential but binding meeting. To be sure, the formal modality of unlawful intervention would still be accomplished by Fraport's designated officer in PIATCO; indeed the real control decision would always have to be implemented, wherever it may have been made, by \"an officer, employee or laborer\" within PIATCO; that would satisfy a literal interpretation. But a literal interpretation here could produce an absurdity: an alien would violate the ADL if its designated officer intervened to manage and control matters A, B and C, but the same alien would not violate the ADL if it secretly intervened as a shareholder to manage and control those same matters. The Tribunal construes this part of the ADL as covering intervention by shareholders, if that is the actual means of intervening in \"the management, operation, administration or control\" of PIATCO. Nor does this interpretation impose a retroactive burden on Fraport, for its own documents, which the Tribunal reviewed above, indicate that Fraport was well aware that the arrangements it was making were not in accordance with the ADL.\n\n**E. The ADL Proceedings in The Philippines**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nIn 2003, two Philippine lawyers, Messrs. Balayan and Bernas, complained to the NBI that the officers and directors of Fraport and PIATCO had violated the ADL, referring to the fact that Fraport owned 61.44% of PIATCO's shares. As the NBI Report makes clear, \"[t]he procedures instituted by the NBI kin response to the complaints of Balayan and Bernas] are merely to gather facts and evidence to determine the need to refer the matter to the Prosecutor's Office for Preliminary Investigation\".\n\n358.\n\nThe \"sole express basis\" for the ADL complaints rested on statements in the Request for ICSID arbitration. The documents submitted to the NBI, which are listed at pages 7-13 of the Report, did not include the secret shareholder agreements nor Fraport's internal documents which have been set out above. Indeed, the NBI received an affidavit to the contrary. The NBI Report records:\n\n\"Subjects CHENG ONG, ET. *[sic]* al., likewise alleged that none of them are bound by any contract commitment or undertaking to allow Fraport AG to, in any manner, exercise legal rights reserved under Philippine law to Philippine citizens or Philippine nationals. They further alleged that Complainants have failed to even insinuate the existence of any such contract, commitment or undertaking, much less submit any evidence thereof.\"\n\n359.\n\nThis was not correct, as is clear from the documents which the Tribunal has set out above.\n\n360.\n\nThe arguments considered in the NBI Report about immunity and the admissibility of the Request for ICSID arbitration, whose equity share descriptions were the basis of the two ADL complaints, are not relevant for the Tribunal's inquiry. The NBI Report concluded that there had been a violation by Fraport of the quantitative test of the Grandfather Rule. But the *ratio* of the NBI Report was that the annulment of the PIATCO concession by the Supreme Court before Fraport could have exercised the potential managerial control it had acquired, which the NBI inferred from the *quantitative* indicators, rendered the ADL violation moot. The NBI Report nonetheless recommended prosecution on the basis of the Respondents \"intent\".\n\n361.\n\nAs a matter of Philippine law, the NBI Report is plainly incorrect in its application of what had become the obsolete \"Grandfather\" quantitative test. But more important for the analysis of the Tribunal is that the NBI could have known nothing of the secret shareholder agreements, which were only produced in the present arbitration in December 2005 and January 2006. Yet the existence of the secret shareholder agreements was the critical factor for answering the question of whether there was a violation of the ADL.\n\n362.\n\nThe NBI Report was issued in June 2004. Eighteen months later, the Prosecutor rejected the NBI recommendation in his report which was issued on 27 December 2006.\n\n363.\n\nAgain, the jurisdictional and admissibility issues in that latter Prosecutor's Report are not relevant for the analysis of the Tribunal. The Prosecutor summarized the Bernas and Balayan complaints as based on a quantitative violation of the ADL: Fraport's equity exceeded 60% by its own admission and would exceed 71% if the holdings of Nissho Iwai were included. The Chengs rejected this Grandfather type computation and, more relevantly, said:\n\n\"The Board of Directors of the said corporations are controlled by Filipino citizens to the extent of at least 60% of the total number of members of the said Board.\n\nThe FRAPORT's financial contribution and technical support to the P1ATCO are completely irrelevant in so far as the Anti-Dummy law was concerned since none of those have been attended by an unlawful level of control over PIATCO's board of directors or management. The officers of PIATCO are all Filipino citizens and they never acted as fronts or FRAPORT AG's dummy or lending their names for FRAPORT AG's benefit. Any allegations, statements or act made by FRAPORT AG before ICSID is not binding upon them as they are not parties thereto.\"\n\n364.\n\nThis was consistent with the Cheng's submission to the NBI, which is quoted above. It is an accurate statement of Philippine law but a misrepresentation of the critical facts.\n\n365.\n\nThe Prosecutor stated that \"it is obvious that the complainants erroneously used the Grandfather Rule\". The Prosecutor relied upon the Foreign Investments Act, which adopts a non-cumulative and more lenient quantitative test and quoted approvingly an SEC opinion of 23 November 1993 which affirms the non-cumulative computation for the equity of the foreign investor, subject however to an important proviso: \"provided, however, that the voting and Board membership requirements under Section 3 R.A. 7042 are complied with.\" The Prosecutor applied the same lenient quantitative test with respect to loans by a foreign investor to a public utility type corporation the issue was not quantum but **\"what is prohibited is the engagement by the alien himself of a** **nationalized activity\"** (emphasis added).\n\n366.\n\nThe Prosecutor agreed that if the Terminal concession had been annulled, the ADL could not be applied. But the Prosecutor's rejection of the NBI report was centrally based upon the applicability of the more lenient non-cumulative computational formula and not on the secret shareholder agreements. At page 10 of the Report, the Prosecutor states, in what is the central holding:\n\n\"From the foregoing corporate structure of PIATCO, it is far-fetched that a foreign corporation like FRAPORT could gain dominion, control and ascendancy in the management or control of PIATCO considering 60% of its shares are owned by Filipinos [...]. Thus, the prohibitions imposed under the provisions of the Anti-Dummy Law have not been transgressed specifically that is, is to prevent foreign intervention or participation in areas traditionally reserved for citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations at least 60% of the capital stock of which is owned by citizens of the Philippines or allowing a noqualified person or corporation from intervening 'in the management, operation, administration or control' of such right, franchise, privilege, property or business.\"\n\n367.\n\nWhat is missing here is reference to or any indication of awareness of the actual secret shareholder agreements by which the management and control prohibited by the ADL was effectively assigned to Fraport. Indeed, in holding that the so-called \"badges of dummy status\" \"were inconclusive and inapplicable to the present case\", the Prosecutor quoted, regarding the third badge, that \"[t]he organization structure of PIATCO would unmistakably show Fraport's clear and concrete control over affairs of the respondent\". But, as is clear from the factual account set out above, the secret shareholder agreements were designed to and did precisely this. Neither the NBI nor DOX Reports deals with the issue of the secret shareholder agreements and their violation of the ADL.\n\n368.\n\nThis Tribunal decided to review the full record of evidence regarding the ADL proceedings which resulted in the Department of Justice's Chief State Prosecutor's Resolution of 27 December 2006 (the \"Prosecutor's Resolution\") dismissing the Bernas and Balayan complaints. Accordingly, as noted earlier in the Award, it requested all of those documents from the Respondent, and the Claimant supplemented the record with other documents. Aside from the legal question of whether a finding by a competent Philippine institution on a matter which arises both under Philippine law and under the BIT binds this Tribunal, the factual question, on which the Tribunal sought to satisfy itself, was whether the secret shareholder agreements constituted part of that record and had been considered in the ADL proceedings. The Respondent contended:\n\n\"Rather, this Tribunal has before it Fraport's secret shareholder agreements themselves (which Fraport belatedly produced at the oral hearing in January 2006). These documents provide the critical proof that Fraport intended to, and did, implement a scheme to exert financial dominance and effective corporate control of PIATCO, and thereby evade Philippine nationality and anti-dummy laws. The Philippine DOX, by contrast, has never had the central evidence proving Fraport's violations of the Anti-Dummy Law, including\n\n\u25cf Fraport's Final Holding Report, which set out Fraport's intention to evade Philippine nationality laws;\n\n\u25cf Fraport's secret shareholder agreements with the Chengs, which established the means by which Fraport obtained unlawful influence in PIATCO and PTI, through 'pooling,' block voting, vetoes, and the right to appoint, indirectly, members of PIATCO's board of directors; and\n\nFraport's secret loan agreements to the Chengs, which enabled the Chengs to make their share subscription payments in PIATCO and its shell companies.\n\nThese critical documents were unavailable to the DOX, not for lack of effort or interest, but (1) because of the confidentiality designation in this arbitration under the ordered confidentiality agreement; and (2) because Fraport, through German courts, blocked the Philippine DOX's request for mutual legal assistance in Germany. Having denied the Philippine DOX the crucial and relevant evidence, Fraport cannot celebrate the DOX's dismissal as evidence of its innocence.\"26\n\n*See* Respondent's letter to the Tribunal of 11 January 2007 at page 2 *(supra* at paragraph 70).\n\n369.\n\nNeither the NBI Report nor the Prosecutor's Resolution, it will be recalled, refers to the secret shareholder agreements. The DOX Prosecutor's summary of the Bernas/Balayan complaints also imports that the secret shareholder agreements were not part of the record, despite oblique references to Fraport's control over PIATCO:\n\n\"Complainant Bernas, alleged among others that Fraport, the officers/directors PIATCO violated the Anti-Dummy as he pointed out in the Request for Arbitration of Fraport with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes as regards to NAIA Terminal 3 Project where it allegedly flaunted its 61.44% foreign ownership in PIATCO. He further added that Nisho *[sic]* Iwai, a foreign corporation, has equity shareholdings of 10 % in PIATCO, which if combined with Fraport's 61.44 ownership would result to a 71.44 % foreign ownership. Thus, 31.44 percent over and above the 40% foreign ownership allowed by the Constitution.\n\nHe, likewise, stressed that badges of a dummy status as embodied in Department of Justice Opinion No. 165, Series of 1984 are present in PIATCO's stockholding composition. He explained that through Fraport's equity stockholding together with Nissho Iwai equity, provided practically all the funds for the operation of PIATCO. In addition, he stated that along with dominant foreign equity contributions, Fraport arranged most of the borrowed funds that were used in the construction of NAIA Terminal 3. This fact can be gleaned from the records of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, which showed that the Cheng Group has only contributed US$9.7 million, while the rest of the funds used come from Fraport ranging from US$ 425 million to US$ 500 million.\n\nFurthermore, he alleged that Fraport may have practically provided all the technological support for the construction of the NAIA Terminal III Project. This came about by reason of the Fraport's representative designation as technical and operation manager for the Project, through PTI. He opined that neither the consortium nor any of the shareholders could provide funds, which could have been used to pay for technical expertise or services. With these controlling or withholding flow of funds and extension of expertise, **Fraport obviously influenced the management and operations of PIATCO.**\n\nMeanwhile, complainant Balayan alleged that Fraport in conspiracy with the member corporation in consortium who participated in the bidding process for the construction of NAIA Terminal Project violated the Constitution and Commonwealth Act No. 108. This is due to the fact that Fraport ownership with PIATCO 61 % comprising of: direct ownership of 30% and indirect ownership of 31.44 % through PAGS, PTH and PTI. He also added that since Nissho Iwai, a foreign corporation has a 10 % shareholding in PIATCO, the total foreign ownership in PIATCO is 71.44 %.\" (emphasis added)\n\n370.\n\nAccording to the DOX Prosecutor, \"badges of dummy status\", in light of the now- confirmed \"Control Test\", are \"inconclusive and inapplicable\" when **\"determining the** **nationality of the corporation\".** The Prosecutor's reasoning thus suggests that it focussed on whether an ADL violation had been demonstrated by a quantitative determination of **nationality** as opposed to an actual demonstration of **managerial** **control.** As noted, the evidentiary record before the DOX Prosecutor did not include the direct evidence of such managerial control, such as the secret shareholder agreements.\n\n371.\n\nWhile it is clear that the Prosecutor's Resolution and the related NBI Report focussed on the issue of nationality as opposed to the issue of managerial control, the record of these proceedings does include references to a \"control agreement\" and \"adjustments] of the Shareholder Agreement\", as noted by the Claimant27. The Claimant has drawn attention to Balayan's Consolidated Reply-Affidavit dated 20 November 2006 in this regard. Balayan's Consolidated Reply-Affidavit expressly refers to the Schmidt Report which recommended a \"control agreement\"28. Reference is made therein to Fraport's \"intention to control the management of respondent PIATCO\", as it was discussed at the Supervisory Board Meeting on 12 March 1999. This section of Balayan's Consolidated Reply-Affidavit also identifies one of the July 1999 shareholder agreements, namely the Addendum to the PIATCO Shareholders Agreement dated 6 July 1999 (referred to as \"Annex S\" of the Complaint-Affidavit29). But the Tribunal would note that this is *not* the secret \"Control Agreement\" described earlier in this chapter as being critical to the issue of jurisdiction *ratione materiae.*\n\n*See* Claimant's letter of 12 January 2007 at page 3 *(supra* at paragraph 71).\n\nAt paragraphs 16.8 and following under the heading \"Respondent Fraport Exercises Management and Control of Respondent PIATCO\".\n\nIt is further noted that the Balayan Complaint-Affidavit states that Fraport increased its shareholdings in 1999 pursuant to four agreements dated 6 July 1999 (at paragraph 10), but solely attaches the Addendum to the PIATCO Shareholders Agreement dated 6 July 1999. The June 2004 NBI Report also refers to these four 1999 shareholder agreements at paragraph 39.\n\n372.\n\nNor does Dr. Schmidt's statement, which was quoted *in extenso* earlier in this chapter, indicate that secret shareholder agreements had been concluded and actually existed. It is useful to recall the critical passages in Dr. Schmidt's words of 7 March 1999 to Fraport's Supervisory Board:\n\n\"In fact, FAG's equity interest shall total 64%. **A 'control agreement' shall ensure that FAG exercises control over the enterprise.**\n\nThis is also absolutely necessary since KPMG points out repeatedly that the current owners are not in a position to ensure the proper operation of the airport.\n\nIn fact, however, **such control is not practicable for legal reasons, as PIATCO's legal due diligence states the following: 'Foreign citizens are prohibited from intervening in the management, operation or control of the company [...]'. Moreover, the summary of the agreements contains the statement that 'a decisive voting right of FAG would violate the anti-dummy law of the Philippines'.**\n\n**Consequently, FAG cannot legally enforce its intended leadership in this consortium.** This, however, is the most important prerequisite for the entire transaction.\" (emphasis added)\n\n373.\n\nThese words would not indicate to an investigator charged with determining whether there was probable cause for a criminal indictment, but from whom the existence and content of the secret shareholder agreements were kept by operation of the confidentiality agreement between the parties to the present arbitration, that such secret agreements were ever concluded. Indeed, the secret agreements continued to be denied by Fraport's officers who were the respondents in the ADL proceedings. Thus, in a comment submitted as part of the ADL proceedings on 19 January 2007, Dr. Stiller stated:\n\n\"Fraport never entered into a control agreement with respect to PIATCO. It is quite natural for a foreign investor, who plans an investment in a legal environment not familiar to it, to explore all legal options available in the relevant jurisdiction. That a foreign investor explores its legal options and then complies with the law is exactly what can be expected from a prudent investor, and does not violate any law.\"\n\n374.\n\nDr. Stiller had made the same point before in a manifestation submitted as part of the ADL proceedings on 8 December 2006:\n\n\"At no time did PIATCO or its stockholders allow the intervention of aliens in its management, operation, administration or control. The Philippine shareholders are actually in control. Control is exercised by the board of directors of PIATCO and not by Fraport. Fraport did not cause, or procure, or itself in any way participate in the management, operation, administration or control of PIATCO other than by nominating the members of the board, to the extent it was authorized to do so under the shareholder agreements. Note that the law allows aliens to be elected to the governing board of nationalized or partly nationalized entities in proportion to their allowable participation of share in the capital of such entities, although such alien directors may not occupy management positions. Aside from pure speculation that control of PIATCO flows from Fraport's alleged substantial funding of the project, there is no independent and concrete proof of control. Admittedly, the Philippine shareholders have always been firmly in control.\"\n\n375.\n\nPlainly Balayan and Bernas suspected and alleged that there was a conspiracy on the part of Fraport to control PIATCO. That was the common predicate of their respective ADL complaints. Balayan's Consolidated Reply-Affidavit does not expressly refer to the secret shareholder agreements, as he was unaware of them, but his conclusion indicates his suspicion of some such arrangement. Balayan's Consolidated Reply- Affidavit states:\n\n\"16.13 The organizational structure of respondent PIATCO would unmistakably demonstrate respondent Fraport's clear and concrete control over the affairs of respondent PIATCO in that respondent Fraport has assigned consultants and officers in the Philippines for the NAIA Terminal III project. Thus, in view of respondent Fraport's hold on both the financial and technical operations of respondent PIATCO, respondent Fraport has necessarily assumed complete and steadfast control over the management of respondent PIATCO's affairs over the NAIA Terminal HI project.\n\n17. Indeed, the totality of the foregoing plainly shows that respondents Fraport, PIATCO, PTH, PTI, PAGS and Paircargo, in conspiracy and for the benefit of one another, knowingly aided, assisted, and/or abetted in the planning, consummation or perpetuation of violations of the Anti-Dummy Law. Resultantly, **appropriate criminal charges should be filed against all the respondents.\"** (emphasis added)\n\n376.\n\nBalayan's Complaint-Affidavit dated 19 November 2003 is referred to in the NBI Report as containing \"details [of] how respondents have allegedly fraudulently created an elaborate web in order to hide their ploy to circumvent our nationality laws\". Later in the NBI Report, there is also a reference to the \"scheme to violate the anti-dummy law\". The point is argued in Balayan's Reply-Affidavit dated 21 June 2004 as follows:\n\n\"3.2 Indeed, it may be conceded that, **on** paper, the capital structure of respondent PIATCO complies with the constitutional limit on foreign ownership. However, this does not serve to stop the NBI from further investigating respondents because even if the capital stock of a corporation appears to comply superficially with the requirement of at least sixty percent (60%) Filipino ownership, this may actually be disregarded, and a review of the contracts or agreements governing the actual relationship of its shareholders may be undertaken by the proper government agency to determine whether the Constitution and the Anti-Dummy Law have, in fact, been violated. Otherwise, the Anti-Dummy Law, which was designed to *[sic]* precisely to prevent foreign intervention or participation in areas of investment reserved for Philippine nationals whether directly or **indirectly through the use of 'dummy relationships',** would be an utter failure and rendered vacuous and nugatory. Notably, respondents have not even disputed, much less denied, the *Complaint-Affidavit* dated 19 November 2003, which details how respondents herein have fraudulently created an elaborate web in order to hide their ploy to circumvent our nationality laws.\" (emphasis in original)\n\n377.\n\nNot surprisingly, the theories put forward by Bernas and Balayan, without the benefit of the secret shareholder agreements, could not and did not persuade the DOX Prosecutor. As every lawyer knows, to bring an indictment and initiate a criminal prosecution, one needs evidence and not theories. The evidence was to be had in the secret shareholder agreements. The ADL charges were accordingly dismissed.\n\n378.\n\nThe Prosecutor's Resolution was subsequently challenged pursuant to Bernas' Motion for Reconsideration dated 18 January 2007 and Balayan's Petition for Review dated 19 January 2007. The former, in particular, is described as being based on the following grounds30:\n\n\"1. Section 3(a) of the Foreign Investment Act, as cited in the assailed resolution does not provide the phrase 'the control test shall be applied for this purpose';\n\n2. The actual citation of SEC Opinion dated November 23 1993 which allegedly resolved 'to do away with the strict application of the Grand Father Rule and instead applied the Control Test in determining corporate nationality for purposes of investment was not stated;\n\n3. The administrative interpretations of the DOX and SEC are at best persuasive, and not controlling, hence, reliance thereon is misplaced;\n\n4. There is no Supreme Court decision stating that the Grand Father Rule is no longer the de jure standard in determining the nationality of a corporation for purposes of criminal prosecution for violation of the Anti-Dummy Law;\n\n5. The resolution would in effect render impossible for anyone to be indicted for violating the Anti-Dummy Law;\n\n6. This Office erred in setting aside the badges of dummy status as enunciated in one of its opinions;\"\n\n*See* DOX Resolution dated 15 March 2007.\n\n379.\n\nOn 15 March 2007, Bernas' Motion for Reconsideration was granted by a DOX Resolution recommending that a criminal indictment for ADL violations be filed with the appropriate court as follows (at pages 12-13):\n\n\"After a careful evaluation of the arguments raised in the motion for reconsideration, it is respectfully opined by this Office that the same is meritorious.\n\nRecord shows that all foreign investments without using the control test to determine the nationality of the corporation constitutes 71.44% thereby violating the Anti-Dummy Law.\n\nLastly, settled is the rule that preliminary investigation is essentially inquisitorial and is often the only means to discover who may be charged with crime, its function is merely to determine the existence of probable cause. (Pilapil vs. Sandiganbayan, 221 SCRA349)\n\nWHEREFORE, the motion for reconsideration is hereby respectfully recommended to be GRANTED. Let an information for violation of AntiDummy Law be filed against herein respondents before the appropriate court.\"\n\n380.\n\nHaving reviewed the additional 1900 pages of documents produced by the Respondent on 14 March 2007, it is clear to the Tribunal that the record of the ADL proceedings did not include the secret shareholder agreements themselves. It is true that there are various references to shareholder agreements generally, and some copies of them, but the vast majority of such references relate to the *2001* shareholder agreements. In fact, apart from the 1999 Addendum to the PIATCO Shareholders Agreement referred to *inter alia* in Balayan's Consolidated Reply-Affidavit, which was set out above, there is no actual copy of any of the 1999 shareholder agreements and, *a fortiori,* of any of the secret shareholder agreements.\n\n381.\n\nThe 1999 Addendum to PIATCO Shareholders Agreement is the only 1999 shareholder agreement that the Claimant has identified as being part of the record in the ADL proceedings, with the added observation that shareholder agreements were \"discussed\" in the proceedings of the Philippine Senate Blue Ribbon Committee in August and September 200231. The Claimant argues that there are \"many references to shareholder agreements\", but, as the quotation from its submission shows, fails to point to any of the secret shareholder agreements32:\n\n*\"See, e.g.,* PIATCO's Amended Articles of Incorporation, Annex D to Balayan Complaint-Affidavit (Ex. R-510 Annex B), at ROP-T-00159 ('Shares represented by this Certificate are subject to the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement, which was executed by and among the Corporation's Shareholders on 23 August 2001...'); PIATCO's Audited Financial Statements, Annex N to Balayan Complaint-Affidavit (Ex. R-510 Annex B), at ROP-T-00347 (Summary of 'Significant Contracts', including Memorandum of Understanding, July 6, 1999, O&M Agreement and Advisory Services Agreement): PIATCO's Amended By-Laws, Annex B to Respondent Castro's Counter-Affidavit, Ex. R-545, at ROP-T-01489 (referring to 'PIATCO Shareholders Agreement dated 14 July 1997 among the stockholders of the Corporation, as amended and supplemented by the Addendum to the PIATCO Shareholders Agreement dated 17 May 2001, and any and all other amendments and supplements thereto...').\"\n\n*See* Claimant's letter of 16 March 2007 at pages 1-2.\n\n*See ibid,* at footnote 4.\n\n382.\n\nThus, the Respondent is correct in stating that \"neither the prosecutors nor the Sandiganbayan had access to the more substantial record of evidence presented to this Tribunal [...] because of the confidentiality restrictions\"33. The Tribunal will consider the legal significance of this factual finding below.\n\n*See* Respondent's letter of 7 March 2007.\n\n**F. The Claimant's Concealment of the Secret Shareholder Agreements**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nAlthough the Respondent raised objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, the specific objection based on a violation of the ADL, as a challenge to jurisdiction *ratione* *materiae,* was essentially argued in post-hearing submissions because most of the documents that established it were produced either immediately before the hearing on jurisdiction and liability or, at the President's insistence, during the hearing itself. As a result, the Claimant's contention that the Respondent's experts did not address this problem is jejune the Respondent, its experts and the Tribunal cannot be expected to be clairvoyant and could not have known of this critical issue before the hearing.\n\n384.\n\nThe Claimant argues, nonetheless, that the word \"accepted\" in Article 1(1) of the BIT is critical to the operation of that provision and since the Philippines did not establish an acceptance regime, that provision does not apply. As noted above, the word \"acceptance\" does not appear in the Instrument of Ratification, which simply states that \"the Agreement provides that the investment shall be in the areas allowed by and in accordance with the Constitutions, laws and regulations of each of the Contracting Parties\". But, without regard to that, it is, as explained in the analysis of the BIT earlier in this Award, unreasonable to assume that state parties would incorporate a reiterated insistence on compliance with their respective constitutions, laws and regulations only not to have them apply.\n\n385.\n\nNor is there need for an acceptance procedure for the purchase of shares, the form of putative investment in this case and the focus of ad Article 2 of the Protocol, which elaborates Article 2 of the BIT. It relates to purchasing shares in a company which might then acquire land in the territory of the Republic. The acquisition of shares by a foreign investor in a domestic corporation is a legal transaction that does not, by its nature, require some action by the government involving acceptance or permission, yet it is quite clear from the BIT and the Protocol that accordance with the host state's law is nonetheless required. That was the ostensible form of Fraport's putative investment. And, to repeat, the Instrument of Ratification makes no mention of \"acceptance\" but speaks only of \"areas allowed by and in accordance with\".\n\n386.\n\nThe Claimant argues, further, presumably in the alternative, that there was, in fact, acceptance through many acts of the Respondent and that the Respondent \"has never initiated any official action pursuant to the Nationality or Anti-Dummy Laws\".\n\n387.\n\nAs a matter of law, the Claimant is correct that the cumulative actions of a host government may constitute an informal \"acceptance\" of a foreign investment that otherwise violates its law. The Claimant is also correct that a failure to prosecute something of the order of a violation of the ADL, such that an investor reasonably inferred that it was acting lawfully and made further investments, could obviate an objection to jurisdiction *ratione materiae.* The issue here, however, is fact. The Claimant, knowing of the violation of the ADL, consciously concealed it, such that any actions that might otherwise have been viewed by a foreign investor in good faith as endorsements by the Philippine government cannot be deemed to have cured the violation or estopped the Government. The Respondent could hardly have initiated legal action against the Claimant for violations which the Claimant had concealed.\n\n388.\n\nThe timing of the initiation of criminal action by the host state in the instant case is particularly complex. A detailed confidentiality agreement was negotiated by the parties to this arbitration and noted by the Tribunal. At the insistence of the Claimant, it precluded the Philippines from using material which might be produced in the course of document exchange in criminal proceedings in the Philippines.\n\n389.\n\nEven in the absence of such an agreement, it is doubtful whether the Philippines could have lawfully undertaken an action which usurped a matter within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It is significant that Fraport's directors, who were respondents in the ADL proceedings, submitted a letter in those proceedings before the Prosecutor, stating:\n\n\"The ICSID has the exclusive jurisdiction to decide the issues presented to it pursuant to the agreement between Germany and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines.\"\n\n390.\n\nAssuming further that the findings of the Prosecutor had dealt directly with the secret shareholder agreements, which is not the case here, such a finding would not constitute a *res judicata* because of a difference in the identity of the parties and the claim. The complaints designed to initiate ADL prosecutions were undertaken by private citizens in a type of *actio popularis* which is available in Philippine law. The parties were different, the claim (initiation of a criminal action) and the issues that were the *ratio* of the preliminary decision were different from those which engage this Tribunal.\n\n391.\n\nMoreover, holdings of municipal legal institutions cannot be binding with respect to matters properly within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. As the *Inceysa* tribunal put it, \"as the legality of the investment is a premise for this Tribunal's jurisdiction, the determination of such legality can only be made by the tribunal hearing the case, i.e. by this Arbitral Tribunal\"34. The Claimant can hardly challenge this legal proposition, for if this were not the case, then its entire substantive case would fail; the decision of the Philippine Supreme Court would have decided the issue against it.\n\nAt paragraph 209.\n\n392.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the point of law in the Claimant's additional argument which is based on \"the foreign investor's reasonable reliance upon the state's contemporaneous manifestations of its understanding of its laws\". A foreign investor is, indeed, entitled to reasonable reliance upon the state's contemporaneous manifestations of its understanding of its laws. The Claimant's problem, again, derives from the facts. The Claimant argues:\n\n\"Fraport was aware of the Nationality and Anti-Dummy Laws from the outset. **Fraport continuously sought and acted upon Philippine legal advice to ensure compliance.\"** (emphasis added)\n\n393.\n\nThis assertion is simply incorrect, as the review of pertinent facts which is set out above and which is based entirely on the Claimant's own documents, shows.\n\n394.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree, as a matter of law, with the Claimant's contention that \"[e]ven if there could be said to be an issue as to whether the Philippine laws were complied with [...], it could be of only municipal, not international legal significance\". This interpretation, if accepted, would deprive a significant part of the ordinary words of a treaty of any meaning and effect. The BIT is, to be sure, an international instrument, mechanism which is hardly unusual in treaties and, indeed, occurs in the Washington Convention. A failure to comply with the national law to which a treaty refers will have an international legal effect.\n\n395.\n\nThe Claimant offers a congeries of arguments to the effect that it never actually exercised control over PIATCO and subsequently revised the secret shareholder agreements to bring them into conformity with the ADL which, in any event, the Claimant alleges, does not criminalize attempts to violate it. The Respondent characterizes these arguments as admissions. The Tribunal does not but rather takes them as legitimate arguments in the alternative which scrupulous counsel are entitled to make. Nonetheless, the arguments fail, for two reasons: first, because the relevance of compliance with national law for jurisdiction *ratione materiae* purposes is at the moment of the investment, as explained in the analysis of the BIT's terms. That is a limitation which actually works in favour of both the foreign investor and international arbitral jurisdiction. Second, because the ADL, which the Claimant only quotes selectively, criminalizes:\n\n\"any person who knowingly aids, assists, or abets in the planning, consummation or perpetration of any of the acts herein above enumerated shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than five nor more than fifteen years [...].\"35\n\nThe contention that Fraport never intended to exercise the power which it took pains to acquire through the secret shareholder agreements is simply not credible.\n\nAnti-Dummy Law, Commonwealth Act No. 108, section 2-A.\n\n**G. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n396.\n\nWhen the question is whether the investment is in accordance with the law of the host state, considerable arguments may be made in favour of construing jurisdiction *ratione materiae* in a more liberal way which is generous to the investor. In some circumstances, the law in question of the host state may not be entirely clear and mistakes may be made in good faith. An indicator of a good faith error would be the failure of a competent local counsel's legal due diligence report to flag that issue. Another indicator that should work in favour of an investor that had run afoul of a prohibition in local law would be that the offending arrangement was not central to the profitability of the investment, such that the investor might have made the investment in ways that accorded with local law without any loss of projected profitability. This would indicate the good faith of the investor.\n\n397.\n\nIn this case, the comportment of the foreign investor, as is clear from its own records, was egregious and cannot benefit from presumptions which might ordinarily operate in favour of the investor.\n\n398.\n\nThe record indicates that (i) the BIT explicitly and reiteratedly required that an investment, in order to qualify for BIT protection, had to be in accordance with the host state's law and (ii) local counsel explicitly warned that a particular structural arrangement would violate a serious provision of Philippine law. Moreover, the violation *qua* violation was explicitly discussed at the level of the Board of Directors. In view of the due diligence study prepared by financial experts (who had apparently not been briefed on the local law restrictions), the investor, Fraport, concluded that the only plausible way for its equity investment to prove profitable was to arrange secretly for management and control of the project in a way which the investor knew were not in accordance with the law of the Philippines. This was accomplished by Article 2.02 of the FAG- PAIRCARGO-PAGS-PTI Shareholders' Agreement of 6 July 1999 which allowed Fraport (or FAG as it was then known) to have a casting and controlling vote over matters which fell within its \"area of expertise and competence\". Thus the violation could not be deemed to be inadvertent and irrelevant to the investment. It was central to the success of the project. The awareness that the arrangements were not in accordance with Philippine law was manifested by the decision to make the arrangements secretly and to try to make them effective under foreign law. All of these facts derive from internal Fraport documents whose credibility can hardly be impeached by Fraport.\n\n399.\n\nA brief comment on evidentiary standards: whatever standard of proof is required under Philippine law to prove a criminal act, the jurisdictional question before this Tribunal, which is seized of an international investment dispute, is not a determination of a crime but whether an economic transaction by a German company was made \"in accordance\" with Philippine law and thus qualifies as an \"investment\" under the German-Philippine BIT. Even assuming, however, that the \"preponderance of evidence\" test which applies in civil law must yield in the instant case to a \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" test because the subject of the \"in accordance\" inquiry is a Philippine criminal statute, this is a case in which *res ipsa loquitur.* The relevant facts, all of which are found in Fraport's own documents, are incontrovertible.\n\n400.\n\nThere is a further troubling factor. Despite requests for document production, the obvious relevance of these secret documents to the Respondent's jurisdictional objection, and a stern warning by the President of the Tribunal early in the arbitration that adverse consequences could be drawn from the failure to produce such documents, it was only in the course of the hearing that the existence of many of these documents became known. It was only at the insistence of the President of the Tribunal at that moment that they were finally produced. In that regard, it lies ill in Fraport's mouth to allege, in its defense, that the Philippines had not \"ever taken any action under its own laws to charge Fraport with any violation of those laws\". If Fraport, as its own documents attest, concealed the agreements in violation of the ADL, how could the Philippines take any legal action against it?\n\n401.\n\nFraport knowingly and intentionally circumvented the ADL by means of secret shareholder agreements. As a consequence, it cannot claim to have made an investment \"in accordance with law\". Nor can it claim that high officials of the Respondent subsequently waived the legal requirements and validated Fraport's investment, for the Respondent's officials could not have known of the violation. Because there is no \"investment in accordance with law\", the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae.*\n\n402.\n\nAs for policy, BITs oblige governments to conduct their relations with foreign investors in a transparent fashion. Some reciprocal if not identical obligations lie on the foreign investor. One of those is the obligation to make the investment in accordance with the host state's law. It is arguable that even an investment which is not made in accordance with host state law may import economic value to the host state. But that is not the only goal of this sector of international law. Respect for the integrity of the law of the host state is also a critical part of development and a concern of international investment law. That said, the Tribunal's decision in this matter does not rest on policy. It is the language of the BIT which is dispositive and it is unequivocal in this matter.\n\n403.\n\nIn *Lucchetti* v. *Peru,* the tribunal observed that:\n\n\"Lucchetti may therefore consider it a harsh result that its effort at obtaining an international remedy is brought to a halt before the merits of its contentions are even examined. Such a conclusion, however, would not be warranted in light of the fact that Lucchetti did not have an *a priori* entitlement to this international forum.\"36\n\nAt paragraph 61.\n\n404.\n\nNor does Fraport, *mutatis mutandis,* in the instant case. Compliance with the host state's laws is an explicit and hardly unreasonable requirement in the Treaty and its accompanying Protocol. Fraport's ostensible purchase of shares in the Terminal 3 project, which concealed a different type of unlawful investment, is not an \"investment\" which is covered by the BIT. As the BIT is the basis of jurisdiction of this Tribunal, Fraport's claim must be rejected for lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae.*\n\nVI. COSTS\n---------\n\n405.\n\nThe Respondent has prevailed in this proceeding since the Tribunal has decided that the dispute is not within its jurisdiction and that the Claimant's claim is therefore dismissed. The general practice in international arbitration is that the successful party should recover its legal costs. Having regard to all the circumstances of this unusual arbitration, the Tribunal is of the view that such an approach would be inappropriate. There is no successful party on the merits in the traditional sense. Accordingly, the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, has formed the view that each party shall bear in full its own legal costs as well as one half of the arbitration costs, including the administration fees for the use of the Centre.\n\n**VII. AWARD**\n--------------\n\n406.\n\nFor the reasons set forth herein and pursuant to Rules 41(5) and 47(1)(i) and (j) of the Arbitration Rules and Article 61(2) of the Convention, a majority of the Arbitral Tribunal decides:\n\n1. To accept the objection to the jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes raised by the Republic of the Philippines;\n\n2. To declare that the Centre does not have jurisdiction to hear this dispute and that this Arbitral Tribunal is not competent to resolve it;\n\n3. To dismiss the claim of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide; and\n\n4. To order that each party shall bear in full its own legal costs and that the payment of the fees and expenses of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal and of the administrative fees for the use of the Centre shall be paid in equal share by each party."}, {"Title": "Decision on Application for Disqualification of Counsel", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2008-09-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Application for Disqualification of Counsel\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Annulment Proceedings**\n--------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 6 December 2007, Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide ('Fraport' or 'the Applicant') filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes ('ICSID' or 'the Centre') an application requesting the annulment of an Award ('the Award') dated 16 August 2007 rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal in ICSID Case No ARB/03/25 commenced by Fraport against the Republic of the Philippines ('the Republic' or 'the Respondent').\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States 1965 (the 'ICSID Convention'). In it, Fraport sought annulment of the Award on three grounds specified in Article 52(1), namely that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1) (b)); that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n3.\n\nThe Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the application on 8 January 2008 and on that date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties. Copies of the Application and accompanying documentation had been forwarded to the Respondent on 6 December 2007, when the ICSID Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Application.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated 14 April 2008, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified that the *ad hoc* Committee had been constituted, and was composed of Judge Peter Tomka, Judge Dominique Hascher, and Professor Campbell McLachlan QC ('the Committee'). The parties were further notified by letter of 18 April 2008 that Judge Peter Tomka had been designated President of the Committee, and on 27 May 2008, the Centre sent to the parties copies of Declarations signed by Members of the Committee pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2).\n\n5.\n\nThe Committee held its first session on 11 June 2008 at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague and several procedural issues were agreed and decided, as more fully recorded in the Minutes of the First Session. The parties confirmed that they did not have any objections to the proper constitution of the Committee or to any of the Members of the Committee.\n\n**B. Background to the application to disqualify counsel**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nFraport's Application for Annulment dated 6 December 2007 was signed by Jeffrey Barist, Michael D Nolan and Lesley A Benn of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP ('Milbank Tweed') and by Eric Schwartz and Sabine Konrad of Dewey & Leboeuf ('Dewey & Leboeuf'), as Counsel for Fraport. The firm of Milbank Tweed had represented Fraport as counsel of record before the Arbitral Tribunal in the original arbitration proceeding. Dewey & Leboeuf, and Mr Schwartz, first appeared in the annulment proceeding instituted by Fraport.\n\n7.\n\nIn her letter of 19 May 2008 to the Committee, Ms Lamm of White & Case on behalf of the Respondent objected to Mr Schwartz's representation of the Applicant in this proceeding on the ground of conflict of interest. She stated that this arose from Mr Schwartz's prior representation of the Respondent in related proceeding. She stated:\n\nDuring the time that he represented Respondent, however, Mr Schwartz received the case file and discussed case strategy with representatives of Respondent.\n\nShe concluded:\n\nIf Mr Schwartz does not voluntarily resign his representation of Fraport, Respondent reserves its rights to take any appropriate action in light of his disqualifying representation of Fraport in this proceeding, including raising a due process objection on the grounds that it must participate in an arbitration where opposing counsel has had access to, and may make use of, confidential information that was obtained from the opposing party.\n\n8.\n\nMr Schwartz replied to Ms Lamm on 26 May 2008 (with a copy to the Committee) rejecting the objection to his representation. He denied having represented the Republic or having had access to confidential information relevant to the present proceeding from the Republic or its representatives. He requested that the Republic withdraw its objection. Ms Lamm replied on 6 June 2008 maintaining the objection, concluding that the Respondent was ready to discuss the matter in greater detail at the First Session of the Committee. Mr Schwartz responded on 9 June 2008 stating that he was unavailable to attend the First Session of the Committee and inviting Ms Lamm to submit the matter to the appropriate bar authorities. Both of these letters were copied to the Committee by their authors.\n\n9.\n\nAt its First Session on June 11, 2008, the *ad hoc* Committee recorded that the Applicant was represented by Mr Barist, Mr Nolan and Ms Benn of Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy LLP, and by Mr Schwartz and Ms Konrad of Dewey & Leboeuf: Minutes of First Session, [2]. As noted above, Mr Schwartz did not attend the First Session. The Committee noted that the Respondent had raised an objection to Mr Schwartz's representation of the Applicant. It was confirmed at that stage that no request on this subject was pending before the Committee. It was also confirmed that the Respondent's objection did not concern the Applicant's representation by Dewey & Leboeuf, but only its representation by Mr Schwartz.\n\n**C. The Application**\n----------------------\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 9 July 2008, White & Case on behalf of the Respondent applied to the Committee for 'an order disqualifying Mr Schwartz from appearing or acting in any way for Fraport in this arbitration' (page 7). White & Case submitted that the Committee should do so:\n\n[T]o safeguard the legitimacy of the arbitral process, to grant procedural due process to both parties during the proceedings, and to ensure that an eventual decision is not tainted by any procedural irregularities. (page 1)\n\n11.\n\nBy letters dated 11 & 16 July 2008, the Committee invited the Applicant, and Mr Schwartz, in his capacity as the subject of the request for disqualification, to file submissions in reply, if they so wished, by 24 July 2008. No separate submission was received from the Applicant. Mr Schwartz, however, replied by letter dated 23 July 2008.\n\n12.\n\nMr Schwartz submitted that the Committee should reject this request. He accepted that the Applicant had invited the Respondent to submit its request to the Committee, noting the Applicant's intention that:\n\n[T]he Committee's decision would finally resolve the matter, without regard to whether the Committee would, in the absence of the parties' agreement, possess the authority to rule on the Republic's objection. (page 10)\n\n13.\n\nOn 25 July 2008, the Committee wrote to the parties, and stated:\n\n[T]he Committee invites the Respondent to clarify whether it contends that Mr Schwartz received confidential information from the Republic of the Philippines. This request is made without prejudice to any decision the Committee may take. In addition, the Committee invites the Respondent to comment on the Rules of the Paris Bar referred to by Mr Schwartz in his letter of July 23, 2008.\n\nThe Committee also invited both parties to provide observations on the Respondent's request in light of the Code of Conduct for Lawyers issued by the Council of the Bars and Law Societies of the European Union, all such submissions to be filed by 15 August 2008.\n\n14.\n\nMr Schwartz replied briefly on 12 August 2008. On 15 August 2008, White & Case filed a further submission, together with a Report of Lawrence Fox of the same date, and 15 exhibits. On 19 August 2008, Mr Schwartz filed his further comments.\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent and Mr Schwartz have each exhibited a number of documents to their respective submissions, including some contemporaneous documents. Neither party nor Mr Schwartz requested that the Committee hold a hearing on the application, which has been decided on the basis of the written pleadings set out above.\n\n**D. Grounds for Application**\n------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent's application relates to Mr Schwartz's appearance as counsel of record in ICC Case No 12610: *Philippine International Air Terminals Co Inc* ('PIATCO') *v The Government of the Republic of the Philippines (acting through the Department of Transportation and Communications* ('DOTC') *and the Manila International Airport Authority)* ('MIAA') ('the ICC Arbitration').\n\n17.\n\nThe basis which the Respondent advances for its application is that:\n\nMr Schwartz has a disqualifying conflict of interest stemming from his prior representation of the Republic in the related and still pending ICC arbitration.\n\nBasis for Disqualification Request\n\nIt is uncontested that, in 2003, Mr Schwartz was retained by the Respondent in the ICC case filed by PIATCO against the Republic of the Philippines. He and his firm later withdrew after PIATCO complained that the firm had a conflict of interest stemming from its prior representation of the Asian Development Bank (\"ADB\") in connection with potential financing for the Terminal 3 project. The Republic respectfully submits that representing a party adverse to a former client in a substantially related dispute constitutes a conflict of interest that disqualifies Mr Schwartz from representing Fraport in this annulment proceeding.1\n\nThe Respondent requests a disqualification order from the Committee '[i]n the interest of safeguarding the integrity of these proceedings.'\n\nWhite & Case letter 9 July 2008, p 2\n\n**E. Mr Schwartz's Reply**\n--------------------------\n\n18.\n\nIn summary, Mr Schwartz's reply is that:\n\nI never represented the Republic in the ICC arbitration, and the Republic has never been my client. Moreover, I never performed any work (or received any confidential information) in relation to the ICC arbitration. By assisting Fraport in the present proceeding against the Republic, I am therefore not violating any ethical duty.2\n\nDewey & Leboeuf letter 23 July 2008, pp 1-2\n\n**F. Facts as to Mr Schwartz's involvement in the ICC Arbitration**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Committee finds the following undisputed facts as to Mr Schwartz's involvement in the ICC Arbitration.\n\n20.\n\nPIATCO commenced the ICC Arbitration by Request dated 26 February 2003.3\n\nTerms of Reference 24 July 2004, [5.49]\n\n21.\n\nOn 20 June 2003, the Philippines Office of the Government Corporate Counsel ('OGCC'), represented by Mr Teehankee and Mr Vega wrote, on behalf of MIAA, to the ICC Court of Arbitration Secretariat (with copies to counsel for PIATCO, Messrs Paulsson and Schwartz of Freshfields and the Philippines Solicitor-General) 'in response to your letter dated 12 June 2003 giving Respondent MIAA until 27 June 2003 to file its answer to the Request for Arbitration and to nominate an Arbitrator.' The letter stated, *inter alia:*\n\n...please be informed that Respondent MIAA is retaining Freshfields... to assist the Office of Government Corporate Counsel in its objection to the violations of MIAA's procedural rights under ICC Rules.\n\n\u2026\n\nWe will instruct our ICC counsel to file the necessary papers with the Secretariat and please take this as authority for Freshfields to have complete access to the file and to be added as a party to receive all notices and communications.\n\n22.\n\nOn 24 June 2003, a facsimile letter was sent in the name of Mr Schwartz to the ICC Secretariat (copied to the same parties as above) which stated:\n\nFurther to Undersecretary Teehankee's letter dated 20 June 2003, the Manila International Airport Authority has retained the law firm of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer as its counsel in the present proceedings.\n\nFurther to my colleague, Reza Mohtashami's telephone conversation with Ms Pui-Ki Ta yesterday, we would be grateful if you could provide us with copies of the correspondence, including the Request for Arbitration, filed to date by the parties. We will of course be happy to bear any costs incurred in this respect.\n\n23.\n\nShortly thereafter PIATCO wrote to Freshfields objecting to its representation of MIAA on the grounds of Freshfields' prior representation of the Asian Development Bank in connection with the project, and, after deliberation, Freshfields withdrew from its representation. According to Mr Schwartz, the letter from PIATCO was written on 25 June 2003 (and received by Freshfields on 27 June 2003), and:\n\n[U]pon receipt of PIATCO's letter, Freshfields immediately suspended all work for MIAA and began investigating the alleged conflict. Freshfields informed the ICC that it was withdrawing from the case on July 16, 2003.4\n\nThis account has not been disputed by the Respondent. The Respondent accepts that Freshfields did resign their representation in response to that objection, and that it was only after their withdrawal that White & Case was retained to represent the Republic in the ICC Arbitration.5\n\nDewey & Leboeuf letter 26 May 2008\n\nWhite & Case letter 9 July 2008, p 5\n\n24.\n\nBy the time the Terms of Reference were signed (24 July 2004), there was a single Respondent: the Government of the Philippines described as set out in [16] above. It was represented by the Solicitor-General, Justice Feliciano and White & Case. MIAA was not named as a separate party or separately represented.\n\n25.\n\nMr Schwartz subsequently ceased to be a member of Freshfields and joined the firm of Dewey & Leboeuf.\n\n**G. Receipt of confidential information**\n------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nMr Schwartz has stated that he received no confidential information from MIAA; that he had no meeting with MIAA and did not discuss the case with MIAA. In his letter to Ms Lamm of 26 May 2008, he stated:\n\nDuring the brief period between Freshfields' receipt of the ICC file and its suspension of work (less than three working days), Freshfields did little more than read the ICC file. It did not receive any documents concerning the case from MIAA. It also did not meet with MIAA, discuss the substance of the case with MIAA or give any advice to MIAA. A letter of engagement was never prepared or executed, a power of attorney was never received (or, to my knowledge, issued), and Freshfields never raised an invoice or received payment for any work.\n\n27.\n\nIn his submission to the Committee of 23 July 2008 (page 9) he further confirmed, as to Freshfields' involvement:\n\nIt did not receive any documents from MIAA or anyone else in the Philippines, apart from the letter sent by MIAA's counsel to the ICC on June 20, 2003. It did not meet with MIAA or discuss the case with MIAA, either before or after June 20, 2003. The only information provided to Freshfields about the case was the information contained in the June 20, 2003 letter, which was also sent to PIATCO, and Freshfields never gave MIAA any legal advice. I have also checked my diary for the period concerned and found that I was in a hearing in Brussels in another matter on June 24-25, 2003 and preparing on June 26-29 for yet a further hearing scheduled to commence on June 30, 2003. I have no recollection of seeing the ICC file received by Freshfields, which is doubtful, and no record of any meeting or discussion during that period with any representative of MIAA.\n\n28.\n\nIn his further submission of 19 August 2008, Mr Schwartz added the following further information as to the letter of 20 June 2003:\n\nPrior to sending that letter, Mr Teehankee contacted Freshfields in order to determine whether it would be willing to provide the assistance described in that letter. Freshfields was advised by Mr Teehankee that he was concerned about the matters described in that letter. Freshfields agreed to review those matters upon receipt of the ICC file. Following receipt and review of the file, it was intended that Freshfields would discuss with Mr Teehankee MIAA's rights under the ICC Rules and assist MIAA in taking appropriate actions in the proceedings. For the reasons already described in my previous letters, no such discussion ever occurred, and Freshfields withdrew without providing any advice or receiving any further information about the arbitration.\n\n29.\n\nIn response to the Committee's specific request of 25 July 2008 that the Respondent inform the Committee whether it contends that Mr Schwartz received confidential information from it, the Respondent has not advanced evidence of such receipt. Rather, its position is that:\n\nThe passage of more than five years and changes of personnel in the government of the Republic make it impossible to state with specificity the full range of information that Mr Schwartz acquired during his representation of the Republic in the ICC arbitration.6\n\nIts submission is that there is an irrebuttable presumption of Californian law (which it submits is binding upon Mr Schwartz as a member of the Californian Bar) that Mr Schwartz acquired confidential information.7\n\nWhite & Case letter 15 August 2008, p 4\n\nIbid, p 5\n\n**H. Relationship between the ICC Arbitration and these proceedings**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nFor reasons which will be developed below, the Committee does not need to make detailed findings as to the extent of the connection between the parties and the subject-matter of the ICC Arbitration and of the present proceedings. Indeed, given the very early stage of this annulment proceeding, and the fact that the only document submitted to the Committee from the ICC Arbitration is the 2004 Terms of Reference, it would not be in a position to do so.\n\n31.\n\nFor the purpose of the present application, it will be sufficient to proceed on the basis that there is a substantial overlap between the subject-matter of the ICC Arbitration and the matters which were the subject of the ICSID Arbitration. Both proceedings concern the project for the construction of Manila Airport Terminal 3, and the actions of the Philippines Government in relation to that project.8 The Committee has been informed by the Respondent that the ICC Arbitration is still ongoing.9\n\nICC Arbitration Terms of Reference; Fraport Application for Annulment [6] - [10]\n\nWhite & Case letter 15 August 2008, pp 9-10, exhibiting a letter from PIATCO's counsel 7 August 2008 (Exh 15)\n\n32.\n\nFraport accepts that PIATCO is the company through which Fraport made its investment in the construction of the Terminal.10\n\nFraport Application for Annulment [8]\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent in each of the arbitrations is the Republic. In the case of the ICC Arbitration, the Republic is stated by PIATCO in its Request to be 'acting through' the DOTC and MIAA, and the summary of its claims in the agreed Terms of Reference describes MIAA as a 'government-owned and controlled corporation.'11 However, the letter from OGCC of 20 June 2003, and Mr Schwartz's letter of 24 June 2003, confine Freshfields' retainer to acting as counsel for MIAA. Mr Teehankee thus informs the ICC (and the other parties, including the Solicitor-General of the Republic) that 'Respondent MIAA is also presently consulting with its co-respondent DOTC' and that 'Respondent MIAA is retaining Freshfields.'12\n\nICC Arbitration Terms of Reference [5.26]\n\nOGCC letter 20 June 2003, p 4\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent and Mr Schwartz disagree as to whether MIAA and the Republic are different persons. Mr Schwartz has submitted that his retainer was limited to acting for MIAA, and that he did not act for the Republic.13 He contends that, therefore, in accepting his present appointment to act against the Republic, he does not have a conflict of interest vis-a-vis a former client. The Republic, on the other hand, submits that MIAA is not a government-owned and controlled corporation. It is an instrumentality of the Republic. Thus it submits: 'The distinction that Mr Schwartz attempts to draw is one without a difference.'14 It is not necessary for the Committee to resolve this question in order to decide the present application.\n\nDewey & Leboeuf letter 26 May 2008, pp 2-3; Dewey & Leboeuf letter 23 July 2008, pp 3-5\n\nWhite & Case letter 9 July 2008, p 4\n\n35.\n\nFinally on this aspect, however, the Committee notes that this annulment proceeding necessarily has a much narrower scope than the proceedings before the ICSID Arbitral Tribunal. The issues which may form the subject-matter of the proceedings before this Committee are strictly limited by the terms of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. A request for annulment is not an appeal or rehearing of the merits of the underlying substantive allegations between the parties. Rather, by the express terms of Article 52, the grounds for any request for annulment must relate to the conduct of the Tribunal: its constitution (Art 52(1)(a)); its powers (Art 52(1)(b)); its members (Art 52(1)(c)); its procedure (Art 52(1)(d)); and the statement of the basis for its Award (Art 52(1)(e)).\n\n**I. Approach of the Committee**\n--------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe ICSID Convention creates a self-contained system for the arbitration of investment disputes, which is not subject to national law. Rather, the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules provide their own *lex arbitri,* subject to international law *.* The Convention and the Arbitration Rules contain no specific rules as to the disqualification of counsel.15 Nevertheless, Article 44 of the ICSID Convention (applicable *mutatis mutandis* to the procedure before the Committee pursuant to Article 52(4)) provides, in relevant part:\n\nIf any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\n\nThe parties have not submitted any prior jurisprudence of ICSID tribunals or committees, which deals with the issue presently before the Committee. Nor are any such decisions reported. Accordingly, the Committee must decide the matter in accordance with the power given to it under Article 44. It notes the agreement of the Respondent and Mr Schwartz that it should do so.16\n\nIn contrast to the specific rules as to the disqualification of arbitrators in Art 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the Arbitration Rules\n\nSee [10] & [12] above.\n\n37.\n\nThe Committee considers that it has the power and duty to conduct the process before it in such a way that the parties are treated fairly and with equality and that at any stage of the proceedings each party is given the opportunity to present its case. This power and duty necessarily includes the power and obligation to make sure that generally recognized principles relating to conflict of interest and the protection of the confidentiality of information imparted by clients to their lawyers are complied with. Indeed, such principles are of fundamental importance to the fairness of the Committee's procedures, such that the Committee has the power and duty to ensure that there is no serious departure from them.\n\n38.\n\nThe Committee also observes that, where the issue involves legal representation, the rights of both parties are potentially affected, since a decision to disqualify counsel from acting for a party in proceedings before the Committee affects that party's freedom to rely upon advice and representation of counsel of its own free choosing.\n\n39.\n\nHowever, the Committee does not have deontological responsibilities or jurisdiction over the parties' legal representatives in their own capacities. Despite the agreement of the parties to submit the present application to it, the Committee has no power to rule on an allegation of misconduct under any such professional rules as may apply. Its concern is therefore limited to the fair conduct of the proceedings before it.\n\n40.\n\nMr Schwartz is a member of the Californian and Paris Bars.17 The parties have made extensive reference in their submissions to the Californian law on legal ethics; and also to the ethical rules of the Paris Bar and, following the Committee's request, to the Code of Conduct for Lawyers issued by the Council of the Bars and Law Societies of the European Union.\n\nDewey & Leboeuf letter 23 July 2008, p 2\n\n41.\n\nThis material is valuable to the extent that it reveals common general principles which may guide the Committee. But none of it directly binds the Committee, as an international tribunal. Accordingly, the Committee's consideration of the matter is not, and should not be, based upon a nice reading of any particular code of professional ethics, applicable in any particular national jurisdiction. Such codes may vary in their detailed application. Rather, the Committee must consider what general principles are plainly indispensable for the fair conduct of the proceedings.\n\n42.\n\nThe present application advances an allegation of prejudice to the fair conduct of these proceedings arising from Mr Schwartz's representation of a former client in related proceedings some five years ago. In the Committee's view, there is a distinction in principle between the conflict of interest which may arise from the concurrent representation of clients, and the issue which arises where a former client (or related party) objects to a lawyer acting against him. Where the allegation relates to the representation of a *former* client, the issue for the Committee is whether there is a real risk that the lawyer could have received confidential information from that client, which may be of significance in the subsequent proceedings, and which may accordingly prejudice the fair trial of the second proceedings.\n\n43.\n\nThe Committee is fortified in taking that approach as a matter of general principle by a number of the authorities referred to or relied upon by the Respondent. Thus, Professor Hazard observes in his authoritative commentary on American legal ethics in relation to disqualification of counsel based on conflicts of interest with a former client:\n\n[The] substantial relationship test is not a formalistic inquiry into degrees of closeness, but is in large measure a judgment as to whether the former client's confidences are at risk of being turned against him. The modern understanding of the test is therefore a particularly good example of the convergence in the law of lawyering of loyalty or conflict of interest concerns, and confidentiality concerns.18\n\nHazard, Hodes & Jarvis *The Law of Lawyering* (3 ed) S 13.5, p 13-13. This work is cited by the Respondent, White & Case letter 9 July 2008, p 2, and an extract is exhibited as Exh 5 to Dewey & Leboeuf letter 23 July 2008\n\n44.\n\nThe Paris Bar Rules and the CCBE Code of Conduct also deal with the position in relation to former clients in terms of the protection of confidential information. The CCBE Code of Conduct, having provided in Article 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 for conflicts of interest in relation to two current clients, turns to the position in relation to former clients in Article 3.2.3, which provides:\n\nA lawyer must also refrain from acting for a new client if there is a risk of a breach of confidences entrusted to the lawyer by a former client, or if the knowledge which the lawyer possesses of the affairs of the former client would give an undue advantage to the new client.19\n\nCCBE Code of Conduct for Lawyers in the European Community Art 3.2.3, reproduced in Griffths-Baker Serving *Two Masters: Conflicts of Interest in the Modern Law Firm* (2002), 91, Exh 1 to White & Case letter 15 August 2008 *.* Art 4.1 (para 3) of the Paris Bar Rules states substantially the same principle: Exh 1 to Dewey & Leboeuf letter 23 July 2008. A similar principle has also been adopted in English law: *Bolkiah v KPMG* [1999] 2 AC 222, 234-5 (HL, per Lord Millett)\n\n**J. Application to the facts**\n-------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nIs there, then, in the present context, any real risk that Mr Schwartz could have received confidential information from MIAA which may be relevant to the current annulment application and give an undue advantage to Fraport, prejudicing the fair disposition of these proceedings?\n\n46.\n\nWithout deciding the question of the relationship between MIAA and the Respondent, the Committee proceeds for this purpose on the basis that the provision of confidential information to Mr Schwartz by MIAA in the ICC Arbitration could potentially prejudice the interests of the Respondent in the present proceedings.\n\n47.\n\nHowever, the Respondent does not allege that Mr Schwartz received specific confidential information from MIAA or from the Respondent, and Mr Schwartz denies that he did. This element of the application is now put by the Respondent on the basis of a presumption (which is said to be irrebuttable under Californian law) that Mr Schwartz would have received confidential information.\n\n48.\n\nThe only two letters which have been submitted to the Committee (the letters of 20 and 24 June 2003) are both open correspondence, common to the parties and the ICC. The documents which Mr Schwartz requested from the ICC on 24 June 2003 were documents filed in the proceedings, which would also have been, of their nature, documents common to both parties. Indeed, it is clear from the OGCC letter of 20 June that no substantive written pleading had yet been filed in the ICC Arbitration, and nor had the Respondent appointed an arbitrator.\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent's expert, Mr Fox, opines that:\n\nFirst, confidential information definitely was shared. In order for Mr Schwartz even to sign the letters in evidence before this Committee as the partner in charge of the matter, his professional duty required him to inform himself on any number of topics relating to the representation - his client's objectives, reasons for hiring him, the client's need for information - and all of that information was and remains confidential.20\n\nReport of Lawrence Fox 15 August 2008, p 4\n\n50.\n\nMr Schwartz denies this.21 His account of the circumstances in which his firm was approached by OGCC to act for MIAA is to the effect that the information which OGCC gave to Freshfields did not go beyond the substance of that set out in the open letter of 20 June 2003.22\n\nDewey & Leboeuf letter 19 August 2008, p 3\n\nCited supra, [28]\n\n51.\n\nThe Committee has no evidence of fact before it disputing this account. It does not find it inherently improbable that a law firm would agree to go on the record for a governmental entity, which it was thought urgently required representation in an existing international arbitration, before receiving confidential information about the matter. The request to the ICC for documentation from the arbitration file on 24 June 2003 is consistent with this.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent's submission that the receipt of confidential information may be presumed from the fact of the retainer is not compelling in the circumstances of this case. As the Committee has already observed, it is not bound by specific provisions of the laws or professional codes of any other jurisdiction, including Californian law, in arriving at its decision. It has nevertheless carefully considered the Opinion of Mr Fox, together with the other materials on this point filed by the Respondent and by Mr Schwartz.\n\n53.\n\nOf course, if the lawyer is actively engaged in the course of a retainer, the client should not be required to prove communication of specific confidential information. By its nature, the lawyer-client relationship requires an ability to communicate in confidence. The very purpose of the protection may be lost if the client, in seeking protection, is required to disclose the very confidences which he seeks to protect. Thus a conclusion about the possession of such information may be based upon the nature of the services which the lawyer provided to the former client and the information which would in the ordinary course be learned by a lawyer providing such services.23\n\nAccord Hazard et al, supra n 18, 13-16.\n\n54.\n\nBut in this case, the retainer was still-born. The evidence before the Committee is that it did not proceed beyond the first communication, Freshfields having stopped work in order to investigate the allegation of conflict made by PIATCO on 27 June 2003. In the view of the Committee, the nature of the services provided by Freshfields from the date on which it accepted the retainer until when it ceased work seven days later was not such as necessarily to require the conclusion that confidential information was provided to it. On the contrary, the evidence from the record which has been produced is consistent with the conclusion that no such confidential information was provided. Despite a specific question from the Committee as to whether the Respondent contends that Mr Schwartz actually received confidential information, the Respondent has not met Mr Schwartz's denial on the facts.\n\n55.\n\nThe Committee cannot act in this regard simply on mere appearances since to prevent a party from having access to its chosen counsel cannot depend upon a nebulous foundation, but rather must flow from clear evidence of prejudice. On the facts as adduced to the Committee, there is no real risk of prejudice to the current proceeding in allowing Fraport to continue to be represented by Mr Schwartz.\n\n56.\n\nIn these circumstances, therefore, the Committee has decided that the Respondent's application must be dismissed.\n\n**K. Decision**\n---------------\n\n57.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee DECIDES:\n\n(1) The Respondent's application for the disqualification of Mr Schwartz from representing or advising the Applicant in this annulment proceeding is dismissed;\n\n(2) All questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Committee and of the parties in connection with this application are reserved for subsequent determination, together with the Application for Annulment."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2010-12-23T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 6 December 2007, Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide *(\"Import\")* filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes *(\"ICSID\"* or *\"the Centre\")* an application in writing requesting the annulment of the Award, dated 16 August 2007 in the arbitration proceeding between Fraport and the Republic of the Philippines *(\"the Philippines\"* or *\"the Respondent\"),* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25). The Award was rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal composed of Mr. L. Yves Fortier, C.C., Q.C. (a national of Canada), Dr. Bernardo M. Cremades (a national of Spain), and Professor W. Michael Reisman (a national of the United States).\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was submitted within the time period provided for in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 18 March 1965 (\"the *ICSID Convention\").* In its application, Fraport seeks annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically claiming that:\n\n1. the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b));\n\n2. there had been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and\n\n3. the Award had failed to state the reasons on which it was based (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n3.\n\nThe Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on 8 January 2008 and on the same date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, transmitted the Notice of Registration to the parties. A copy of the Application had been sent to the Philippines on 6 December 2007, when the ICSID Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Application.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of 14 April 2008, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified by the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID that an *ad hoc* Committee (\"the *Committee\")* had been constituted, composed of Judge Dominique Hascher (a national of France), Professor Campbell McLachlan Q.C. (a national of New Zealand), and Judge Peter Tomka (a national of the Slovak Republic), and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date. The parties were also notified that Ms. Eloise Obadia, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee. By letter of 18 April 2008, the parties were notified that the Members of the Committee had designated Judge Peter Tomka as President of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held, with the agreement of the parties, in the Peace Palace at The Hague on 11 June 2008. Several issues of procedure were discussed, agreed upon and decided. The agreements and decisions were recorded in the Minutes.\n\n6.\n\nOn 9 July 2008, the Respondent submitted to the Committee an application for an order disqualifying one of the Applicant\u2019s counsel. After providing the parties and the counsel in question with the opportunity to submit their comments and replies on the request and after having deliberated, the Committee issued, on 18 September 2008, the Decision on Application for Disqualification of Counsel. The Committee dismissed the application and reserved all questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Committee and of the parties in connection with that application for subsequent determination, together with the Application for Annulment.\n\n7.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, the Applicant filed its Memorial on 25 September 2008, and the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on 15 January 2009. In the second round of the written procedure, the Applicant filed its Reply on 15 April 2009, and the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on 15 July 2009.\n\n8.\n\nOn 2 April 2009, Fraport filed an Urgent Request to the Committee for an order of protection in connection with the initiation by the Philippines\u2019 Department of Justice of criminal prosecution of \"Fraport\u2019s Philippine arbitration counsel.\" The Committee, after having provided opportunity to the parties to submit their observations and comments, issued, on 3 June 2009, its Decision on the above request. The Committee decided that \"[u]nder the circumstances as they ha[d] been presented to it, the Applicant ha[d] not satisfied the Committee that the requested relief [was] justified. Its request [was] therefore dismissed.\" The Committee further decided that \"[a]ll questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Committee and of the parties, in connection with this Request [were] reserved for subsequent determination, together with the Application for Annulment.\"\n\n9.\n\nAs agreed, a three-day hearing was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. on 24, 25 and 26 August 2009, at which counsel for both parties presented their arguments and submissions, and responded to questions from the Members of the Committee. Present at the hearing were:\n\n1. The Members of the Committee: Judge Peter Tomka, Judge Dominique Hascher, Professor Campbell McLachlan, Q.C., and the Secretary of the Committee Ms. Eloise Obadia;\n\n2. Fraport\u2019s representatives: Mr. Peter Henkel, Ms. Aletta von Massenbach and Ms. Dorte Ochs of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide; Dr. Sabine Konrad of K&L Gates LLP; Mr. Eric Schwartz of King & Spalding LLP; Mr. Michael D. Nolan, Mr. Edward Baldwin, Mrs. Elitza Popova-Talty and Mr. Frederic Sourgens of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, LLP; Ms. Lesley Benn of Shulman, Rogers, Gandal, Pordy & Ecker, PA; Mr. Cesar P. Manalaysay and Mr. Edgardo G. Balois of Siguion Reyna Montecillo and Ongsiako.\n\n3. The representatives of the Republic of the Philippines: Mr. Alfonso Cusi, Former General Manager, Manila International Airport Authority; Ms. Gloria Victoria Yap-Taruc and Ms. Ellaine Rose A. Sanchez-Corro, Assistant Solicitors General, Office of the Solicitor General of the Republic of the Philippines; Justice Florentino P. Feliciano (Ret.) of Sycip Salazar Hernandez & Gatmaitan; Ms. Carolyn B. Lamm, Ms. Abby Cohen Smutny, Ms. Andrea Menaker, Ms. Anne D. Smith, Mr. Stephen Ostrowski, Mr. Hansel Pham, Mr. Rahim Moloo, Mr. Amr Abbas, and Ms. Erin Vaccaro of White & Case, LLP.\n\n10.\n\nOn 15 October 2009, the parties submitted their statements of costs.\n\n11.\n\nOn 3 August 2010, the Respondent informed the Committee that the Arbitral Tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce rendered an Award, dated 22 July 2010, in *Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc.* v. *Government of the Republic of the Philippines (\"ICC Award),* and sought the Committee\u2019s leave to submit that Award for the Committee\u2019s consideration. The Applicant, in its letter of 5 August 2010, took issue with certain statements in the Respondent\u2019s request, concluding that \"if the *ad hoc* Committee wishes to include the ICC award in the record, Fraport requests an opportunity briefly to comment on the award and in particular its reliance upon Philippine legal materials not in the record of this [annulment] proceeding.\" The Committee subsequently invited the parties, on 13 August 2010, to elaborate in writing why the Award of 22 July 2010 would be relevant for the annulment proceeding, as well as to provide the legal basis for admitting this Award into the annulment record. Both parties availed themselves of this opportunity and filed within the prescribed time limits their submissions, the Philippines on 23 August 2010, and Fraport on 31 August 2010. The Committee duly considered their submissions at its meeting on 6 September 2010 and informed them, through a letter from its Secretary, dated 7 September 2010, of the following decision:\n\n\"The Committee has decided not to admit the ICC Award into the annulment record in view of the limited nature of the annulment proceeding. The function of the Committee is to review the conduct of the Arbitral Tribunal which rendered the challenged decision and the decision itself. As the ICC Award had not been in front of the ICSID Arbitral Tribunal in the *Fraport* v. *The Philippines* case, being non-existent at that moment, it could not have been taken into account by the ICSID Tribunal. The Committee is of the view that its task is to review the Award rendered by the ICSID Tribunal only in light of the original arbitration evidentiary record.\"\n\n12.\n\nThe Committee declared the proceeding closed on 22 October 2010, pursuant to Arbitration Rules 53 and 38(1).\n\n13.\n\nDuring the course of the proceedings, the Members of the Committee deliberated by various means of communication, including meetings in Washington on 27 August 2009, at The Hague on 3 November 2009, in Washington on 11 April 2010, in Paris on 28 June 2010, and in The Hague on 6 September 2010, and have taken into account all pleadings and documents before them.\n\n**II. THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe dispute has arisen out of an investment made by Fraport, which is a German company, in a Philippine company, Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc., later known as PIATCO.\n\n15.\n\nIn 1997, the Philippine government conferred upon PIATCO the concession rights for the construction and operation of an international passenger terminal at Manila\u2019s principal airport, known as \"Ninoy Aquino International Airport Passenger Terminal III\" *(\"Terminal* 3\"). The Concession Agreement was entered into on 12 July 1997 between PIATCO and the Philippine government, represented by its Secretary of Transportation and Communication.1\n\nAward, para. 98.\n\n16.\n\nIn 1998, the terms of the Concession Agreement were renegotiated in order to allow PIATCO to obtain financing from certain interested lenders. The Amended and Restated Concession Agreement *(\"ARCA\")* was signed by PIATCO and the Secretary of the Department of Transportation and Communication on 26 November 1998.2 Three supplements to the ARCA were executed between 1999 and 2001, the first on 27 August 1999, the second on 4 September 2000, and the third one on 22 June 2001.3\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 102.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 111-113.\n\n17.\n\nFraport\u2019s investment started in 1999 when, on 6 July, it entered into four agreements (the *\"1999 Share Purchase Agreements and Share Subscription Agreements\")* whereby it acquired direct and indirect interest in PIATCO as follows: 25% of PIATCO, 40% of PAGS Terminals, Inc. *(\u00bf\u2018PTC)* and 40% of PAGS Terminal Holding, Inc. *(\u00bf\"PTH\")',* PTI further acquired 11% of PIATCO.4\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 124.\n\n18.\n\nThe construction of Terminal 3 commenced on 15 June 2000 to be completed in 30 months, by late 2002. As the project under construction required further financial resources and PIATCO\u2019s other shareholders were either unable or unwilling to invest additional money into the Terminal 3 project, Fraport accordingly decided to increase its shareholdings pursuant to two agreements dated 5 May 2000 (the *''2000 Share Purchase Agreements\u2019)* and thus it acquired an additional 5% of PIATCO, and PTI acquired another 24% of PIATCO.5\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 127, 129 and 130.\n\n19.\n\nIn 2001, Fraport acquired a 40% stake in PAGS, thus having an additional 9.04% indirect interest in PIATCO. The Award notes that, as of that point, Fraport had acquired 61.44% direct and indirect ownership of PIATCO.6\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 131; *see also* para. 11 of the Award.\n\n20.\n\nIn late 2001 and throughout 2002 PIATCO/Fraport\u2019s representatives were involved in numerous negotiations on the two further supplements to the ARCA. The Fourth Supplement was proposed by PIATCO in order to accommodate the conditions set by the Senior Lenders for a drawdown of the loans,7 the Fifth Supplement was sought by the Philippine government which required, *inter alia,* that PIATCO surrender the exclusivity of Terminal 3 for international passenger operations at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (\"W4L4\").8 The Government representative asserted in a communication to PIATCO that the concession agreement required changes which the Government proposed in the draft Fifth Supplement \"to address infirmities which [PIATCO\u2019s] concession has sustained.\"9\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 132 and 134.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 158.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 166.\n\n21.\n\nDespite the numerous meetings and exchanges between the parties, no agreement was reached on the proposed Fourth and Fifth Supplement to ARCA. In September 2002, the government considered its options. While the Cabinet Review Committee was still recommending negotiations with PIATCO, the Presidential Advisor on Strategic Projects, who held a Cabinet rank, wrote to the President of the Philippines advising \"that the Government proceed with obtaining a declaration of nullity\" of the concession agreement.10\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 178-180.\n\n22.\n\nIn the same period, PIATCO\u2019s concession agreement and the circumstances surrounding its conclusion were the subject of the Philippines\u2019 Senate investigation. In her testimony before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee in August and September 2002, the Presidential Advisor on Strategic Projects opined for the first time, as the Arbitral Tribunal noted, that the concession contracts, which she had been busy renegotiating, should be declared null and void.11 In her memorandum submitted to the Committee, she expressly stated that there would be severe negative financial consequences for both the Government and Philippine Airlines if the Concession Agreement was performed and its invalidation and nullification not obtained. As she explained, \"the financial and operational issues of NAIA Terminals 1, 2 and 3 and the proposed international cargo terminal must be rationalized.\"12 The Report, issued by the Senate Committee on 10 December 2002, concluded that: (1) the PIATCO contracts were intrinsically void because the required six signatures of the Members of the Investment Coordination Committee of the Philippine National Economic Development Authority were not obtained; (2) the contracts were also void because there were substantial deviations from the Bid Documents; (3) the contracts contained onerous and disadvantageous provisions contrary to public policy and to the Act Authorizing the Financing, Construction, Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructure Projects by the Private Sector and for Other Purposes *(\u00bf\u2018BOTLaw\")',* (4) the payment for buying favors from the government was condemned; (5) the contract provides for a direct government guarantee which is prohibited by the BOT Law; and (6) the condition of the terminal facility raised serious security concerns.13\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 183 and 184.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 186.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 189.\n\n23.\n\nAt the end of November 2002, the President of the Philippines declared that her Government would not honor the Terminal 3 contracts as \"the Solicitor General and the Justice Department have determined that all five agreements covering the NAIA, most of which were contracted in the previous administration, are null and void.\"14 The Arbitral Tribunal did not fail to note that the Memorandum of Department of Justice of 28 November 2002, to which the President of the Philippines referred in her statement, was \"strikingly different from the Department of Justice\u2019s prior written advice to the President on 21 May 2002 that had identified several provisions of ARCA which \u2018may be possible subjects of renegotiation\u2019 but neither stated that the ARCA was null and void nor questioned the validity of the original Concession Agreement.\"15 The Arbitral Tribunal also noted that the 28 November 2002 memorandum was diametrically different from \"Contract Review No. 434,\" dated 30 September 2002, in which the Office of the Government\u2019s Corporate Counsel concluded that the concession agreements were valid, and added that \"[r]ecords attest to the fact that the negotiation, drafting, execution and signing of the Concession Agreement were strictly in accordance with\" the BOT Law and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.16\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 190.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 194.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 195.\n\n24.\n\nFraport continued in its efforts to find a solution. In that period the Supreme Court of the Philippines had been considering, since September 2002, several petitions for prohibition against PIATCO and others. The Supreme Court, in its decision of 5 May 2003, determined that serious violations of Philippines law and public policy, in respect of several issues raised by the petitioners, had taken place, and concluded that the concession agreements in the Terminal 3 projects were null and void *ab initio.* It also concluded that PairCargo was not a qualified bidder and therefore the award of the Terminal 3 concession contract to PairCargo was null and void.17\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 217.\n\n25.\n\nOn 17 September 2003, Fraport initiated arbitral proceedings against the Philippines by submitting its Request for Arbitration to ICSID, pursuant to arbitration provisions contained in the \"Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of the Philippines on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated 18 April 1997 and in force since 2 February 2000 (the *\"BIT\"* or *\"Treaty\").*\n\n26.\n\nWhile international arbitral proceedings were in progress, the Republic of the Philippines, in December 2004, took possession of Terminal 3 and instituted domestic court expropriation proceedings, also in December 2004.\n\n**III. THE ARBITRAL AWARD**\n---------------------------\n\n27.\n\nIn the arbitral proceedings, which developed, as the Tribunal itself noted, \"in some respects, in a most unusual manner,\"18 the Respondent challenged the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* arguing that the Claimant\u2019s investment did not enjoy protection afforded by the BIT. The Respondent argued that the Claimant made its investment in violation of the laws of the Philippines, in particular the Philippine Constitution and Commonwealth Act No. 108, entitled \"An Act to Punish Acts of Evasion of the Laws on the Nationalization of Certain Rights, Franchises or Privileges,\" (the so-called Anti-Dummy Law (the *\"ADL\"))19* In the view of the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s investment fell outside of the BIT\u2019s expressly limited scope because it was not made in compliance with Philippine law.20 The Tribunal understood the Respondent to be arguing that \"the Claimant\u2019s investment was not \u2018accepted\u2019 in accordance with the laws of the Philippines, in the words of Article 1(1) of the BIT.\"21\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 1\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 290.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 285.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimant argued that its investment was an investment within the meaning of the term, as defined in Article 1(1) of the BIT, and, therefore, that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to decide the case. The Claimant emphasized that the Respondent knew the details of PIATCO\u2019s shareholding structure and never charged Fraport with any violation of its ADL or nationality laws.22\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 293, 295.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal, at the outset of its analysis, observed that \"it is possible that an economic transaction that might qualify *factually* and *financially* as an investment... falls, nonetheless, outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal established under the pertinent BIT, because *legally* it is not an \u2018investment\u2019 within the meaning of the BIT.\"23 Then it proceeded to consider the factual allegations regarding the Claimant\u2019s investment as it related to the laws of the Philippines, in particular the ADL. It came to the conclusion that, while \"Fraport\u2019s equity investment in terms of the statutorily limited percentage in the Terminal 3 project was lawful under Philippine law,\" its \"controlling and managing the investment was not.\"24 The Tribunal was \"persuaded from Fraport\u2019s own internal and contemporaneous documents that it was consistently aware that the way it was structuring its investment in the Philippines was in violation of the ADL and accordingly sought to keep these arrangements secret.\"25 Having then observed that \"[w]hile this factual record is troubling, it does not *eo ipso* mean that the Tribunal is without jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to hear the substance of the claim,\"26 it proceeded to the determination of its jurisdiction in accordance \"with applicable legal standards.\"27 The Tribunal identified as the legal standards applicable to its jurisdiction Articles 1(1) and 2(1) of the BIT,28 the Protocol to the BIT (ad Article 2)29 and the Philippines\u2019 Instrument of Ratification30 of the BIT. The Tribunal stressed that \"[b]ecause the exchange of instruments of ratification puts a treaty into effect in accordance with its terms, the second preambular paragraph...is particularly important in regard to the issue at bar.\"31\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 306 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 323.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 332.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 333.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 335. Article 1(1) of the BIT, in its relevant part, reads as follows: \"[t]he term \u2018investment\u2019 shall mean any kind of asset accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State.\" Article 2(1) reads as follows: \"Each Contracting State shall promote as far as possible investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting State and admit such investments in accordance with its Constitution, laws and regulations as referred to in Article 1, paragraph 1 [... ].\"\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 336. The provision ad Article 2 reads as follows: \"As provided for in the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, foreign investors are not allowed to own land in the territory of the Republic of the Philippines. However, investors are allowed to own up to 40% of the equity of a company which can then acquire ownership of land.\"\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 337.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 338. The second paragraph of the Philippines Instrument of Ratification reads as follows: \"Whereas, the Agreement provides that the investment shall be in the areas allowed by and in accordance with the Constitutions, laws and regulations of each of the Contracting Parties.\"\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that the above-mentioned \"provisions [were] manifestly limitations *ratione materiae,\"* noting that \"their interpretation [was] not simple.\"32 Then having considered the FAG-PAIRCARGO-PAGS-PTI Shareholders\u2019 Agreement of 6 July 1999, it concluded that it \"translates *per se* into managerial control over a modern corporation\"33 by Fraport, with managerial control being in violation of the ADL.34 In the view of the Tribunal, \"Fraport knowingly and intentionally circumvented the ADL by means of secret shareholder agreements.\" Therefore, in its view, Fraport \"cannot claim to have made an investment \u2018in accordance with law.\u2019\"35 The Tribunal concluded that \"[b]ecause there is no \u2018investment in accordance with law,\u2019 the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae.\"36* The Tribunal thus, by a majority vote, decided:\n\n\" 1. *To accept the objection to the jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes raised by the Republic of the Philippines;*\n\n2. *To declare that the Centre does not have jurisdiction to hear this dispute and that this Arbitral Tribunal is not competent to resolve it;*\n\n3. *To dismiss the claim of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide; and*\n\n4. *To order that each party shall bear in full its own legal costs and that the payment of the fees and expenses of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal and* *of the administrative fees for the use of the Centre shall be paid in equal share by each party.\"37*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 339.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 350.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 351.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 401.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 406.\n\n31.\n\nArbitrator Bernardo Cremades attached to the Award a twenty-four page, single-spaced dissenting opinion. He strongly disputed the finding of the majority that there was a breach of the ADL. Even if a violation had occurred it would not have, in his view, stripped Fraport\u2019s investment of all BIT protection. Fraport\u2019s shareholdings in a Philippine corporation are still a kind of asset accepted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Philippines and therefore, in his view, the Tribunal would not have been deprived of its jurisdiction even if the ADL was breached. He relied on the Philippine Supreme Court decision in *Agan* v. *PIATCO* which found that the grant of the Terminal 3 Concession to PIATCO in 1997 was null and void. That decision, in his view, is now *res judicata* in Philippine Law. He pointed out that the Tribunal is bound to apply Philippine Law in its interpretation of the ADL and that it manifestly exceeds its powers if it does not do so. He further added that the Tribunal is not bound by a decision of a Philippine court - even the Supreme Court - but the Tribunal\u2019s decision on Philippine Law must be premised on Philippine law itself. He considered that it is *res judicata* in Philippine law that the Terminal 3 Concession is null and void *ex tunc* and not *ex nunc,* and that this must be accepted by the Arbitral Tribunal. In his view, the Tribunal should have respected the consequences of the Supreme Court decision. On this basis, he concluded, it is impossible for PIATCO, or FRAPORT, to be guilty of any breach of the ADL. Finally, he addressed the issue of illegality and jurisdiction, which he considered to be a matter of principle. In his view, the legality of the investor\u2019s conduct is an issue for the merits. The inquiry at the jurisdictional phase required by the phrase *\"in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Host State\"* is limited to determining whether the type of asset is legal in domestic law. He was of the view that the proper interpretation of Article 1(1) of the Philippines-Germany BIT in accordance with the Vienna Convention produces exactly this result. He concluded that the decision of the majority is not only contrary to the terms of Article 1(1) of the Philippine-Germany BIT, but that it is also fundamentally wrong in its approach to illegality as a matter of principle.\n\n**IV. THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT RELIED UPON BY FRAPORT**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nAs noted above (paragraph 2), the Applicant in its request to the Committee for the annulment of the Award relies on three separate grounds provided for in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention; namely that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b)), that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)), and that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 5l(1)(e)). The Committee will in turn consider whether any of these grounds has been established to its satisfaction in the course of this proceeding, and if so whether it should annul the award. Article 52(3) provides that \"the Committee shall have the authority to annul the award or any part thereof.\"\n\n**A. Manifest Excess of Power (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe first ground upon which the Applicant relies in its Application for the annulment of the Award is that which is set forth in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Article 52(1)(b) reads as follows:\n\n\"Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General [of the ICSID] on...the following ground[]:\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\"\n\n34.\n\nAs stated earlier (see paragraph 30 above), the Arbitral Tribunal decided that \"the Centre does not have jurisdiction to hear this dispute and that this Arbitral Tribunal is not competent to resolve it.\"\n\n35.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it declined to exercise jurisdiction which, according to Fraport, it possessed under the ICSID Convention and the German-Philippine BIT. The Committee will deal below with the arguments advanced by the parties regarding this alleged excess of powers by the Tribunal.\n\n36.\n\nThe Committee notes, at the outset, that it is well established in the practice of the application of Article 52(1)(b) by various *ad hoc* Committees that a failure to exercise jurisdiction where such jurisdiction does exist constitutes an excess of powers. The *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi I,* in an oft-cited passage, explained, in the following terms, that a failure to exercise jurisdiction could constitute an excess of powers:\n\n\"It is settled that an ICSID Tribunal commits an excess of powers not only if it exercises jurisdiction which it does not have under the relevant agreement or treaty and the ICSID Convention, but also if it fails to exercise a jurisdiction which it possesses under those instruments. One might qualify this by saying that it is only where the failure to exercise jurisdiction is capable of making a difference to the result that it can be considered a manifest excess of power. Subject to that qualification, however, the failure by a tribunal to exercise a jurisdiction given it by the ICSID Convention and a BIT, in circumstances where the outcome of the inquiry is affected as a result, amounts in the Committee\u2019s view to a manifest excess of powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b).\"38\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, *(\"Vivendi I\"),* 6 ICSID Reports, p. 363, para. 86.\n\n37.\n\nA number of *ad hoc* Committees have endorsed this reading of Article 52(1)(b), albeit using different words and formulations, as equally covering both instances (1) when a Tribunal assumes jurisdiction and exercises it when in fact no jurisdiction has been granted to it, and (2) when a Tribunal fails to exercise the jurisdiction which it has been granted.39\n\n*See, e.g., Soufraki v. UAE,* Decision on Annulment, 5 June 2007, para. 43; *Lucchetti* v. *Peru,* Decision on Annulment, 5 September 2007, para. 99.\n\n38.\n\nSeveral arbitral awards in which Tribunals concluded that they lacked jurisdiction have subsequently been annulled by *ad hoc* Committees. In those cases, the *ad hoc* Committees, having duly considered the awards and arguments of the respective parties, reached the conclusion that the Tribunals by failing to exercise jurisdiction manifestly exceeded their powers.40\n\n*See, e.g., Vivendi I, supra* n. 38, paras. 86-88, 93-115; *Malaysian Historical Salvors SDN BHD v. Malaysia,* Decision on Annulment, 16 April 2009.\n\n39.\n\nThe Committee further notes that under Article 52(1)(b) the excess of powers must be \"manifest\" in order to provide a ground for the Committee to annul an Award. As is well known, Article 52 of the ICSID Convention was inspired by Article 35 of the Model Rules on Arbitral Procedure, which were adopted by the United Nations International Law Commission in 1958 on the basis of the reports submitted by its Special Rapporteur Professor Georges Scelle. Article 35 of the Model Rules provides that\n\n\"The validity of an award may be challenged by either party on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) That the tribunal has exceeded its powers;...\"41\n\nThe word \"manifestly\" was added to the First Draft of what was to become the ICSID Convention upon the suggestion of the German delegate, who thought that otherwise there might be some risk of frustration of Awards.42 The proposal to delete the word \"manifestly\" was put to the vote and rejected.43 Therefore, because the adjective is part of the rule contained in Article 52(1)(b), it must be given effect. The question is what is the implication of the adjective \"manifestly\" for the proper construction of this ground for annulment.\n\n*See Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1958,* Vol II, p. 86. (Also in *History of the ICSID Convention, {\"History\"),* Vol. I, p. 230). Model Rules were originally drafted for arbitral proceedings in order to settle disputes between States.\n\n*History,* Vol. II-l, p. 423, Vol. II-2, p. 850.\n\nIbid,... pp. 851-2.\n\n40.\n\nThe Commentary to the ICSID Convention declares that \"Article 52(1)(b) entails a dual requirement: there must be an excess of powers, and that excess must be manifest.\" Referring to the dictionary meaning of the term \"manifest,\" which may be understood as \"plain,\" \"clear,\" \"obvious\" or \"evident,\" the Commentary expresses the view that the manifest nature of an excess of powers \"relates to the ease with which it is perceived,\" concluding that \"[a]n excess of powers is manifest if it can be discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis.\"44 If this were to be the case, it would mean that the important and exclusive control over the integrity of the arbitration process instituted by the Contracting States through inclusion of Article 52 in the ICSID Convention may be satisfied by a merely superficial inquiry. One may further wonder why there is need for extensive submissions by the parties on the manifest excess of power if it would suffice for the members of the Committee merely to read the award and to \"discern[] with little effort and without deeper analysis\"45 that the Arbitral Tribunal exceeded its powers. Such a conclusion, of course, would have been reached on the basis of a simple reading, and would therefore be manifest.\n\nCh. Schreuer with L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, A. Sinclair, *The ICSID Convention, A Commentary,* 2nd ed., (2009), p. 938, para. 135.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n41.\n\nThe Committee is aware that several *ad hoc* Committees have in the past made a number of various pronouncements on manifest excess of power, and adopted different methodological approaches to this issue. Some favoured a \"self-evident\" or \"simple reading\" approach (test). Thus the *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena Hotels v. Egypt* stated:\n\n\"The excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. Where the latter happens the excess of power is no longer manifest.\"46\n\nFor the *ad hoc* Committee in *CDC v. Seychelles,* \"the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy.\"47 The Committee then added that \"[a]ny excess apparent in a Tribunal\u2019s conduct, if susceptible of argument \u2018one way or the other,\u2019 is not manifest.\"48 This approach reached its zenith in *Repsol v. Petroecuador,* in which the *ad hoc* Committee held the view that \"manifest\" should be interpreted as \"obvious by itself\u2019 and ascertainable \"simply by reading the Award, that is even prior to a detailed examination ot its contents.49\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2002, 6 ICSID Reports, pp. 135-136, para. 25.\n\n*CDC* v. *Seychelles,* Decision on Annulment, 29 June 2005, 11 ICSID Reports, p. 251, para. 41.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Repsol* v. *Petroecuador,* Decision on Annulment, 8 January 2007, para. 36.\n\n42.\n\nSome other Committees perceived the requirements of \"manifest excess\" to be a condition for the annulment related not so much to the clarity of an excess as to its extent or seriousness.50\n\n*Vivendi I, supra* n. 38, paras. 104-112, 115.\n\n43.\n\nAnother *ad hoc* Committee in *Soufraki v. UAE* attempted to reconcile these views when it stated:\n\n\"...the Committee believes that a strict opposition between two different meanings of \u2018manifest\u2019 - either \u2018obvious\u2019 or \u2018serious\u2019 - is an unnecessary debate. It seems to this Committee that a manifest excess of power implies that the excess of power should at once be textually obvious and substantially serious.\"51\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE,* Decision on Annulment, 5 June 2007, para. 40.\n\n44.\n\nIn the view of this Committee, the requirement of a \"manifest excess of power\" goes to the nature of the review exercise. In cases where the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is reasonably open to more than one interpretation, the *ad hoc* Committee will give special weight to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the jurisdictional instrument. The Committee will not intervene where the Tribunal\u2019s decision on its jurisdiction was not unreasonable. This approach seems to be justified because what is at issue here is the interpretation of an international treaty - the BIT concluded between the two sovereign States. Such an approach has been followed by the International Court of Justice in its review jurisprudence.52 The Committee is convinced that the jurisprudence of ICSID *ad hoc* Committees on the \"tenable\" standard for review on issues of jurisdiction53 is to be interpreted to like effect. The Committee considers that the excess of jurisdiction should be demonstrable and substantial and not doubtful.\n\n*See* *Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989 (Guinea-Bissau v. Senegal), I.C.J. Reports 1991,* p. 69, paras. 47-48. *See also Government of Sudan and The Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Army (the Abyei Arbitration),* Final Award of July 22, 2009, para. 510, referring to \"the standard of review established by the ICJ\".\n\n*See, e.g, Kl\u00f4ckner I v. Cameroon,* Decision on Annulment, 3 May 1985, 2 ICSID Reports, p. 115, para. 52.\n\n45.\n\nThe fact that difficult questions of law are raised, requiring extensive argument, is not necessarily conclusive of whether or not the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. Instead, because the purpose of the inquiry is to determine the reasonableness of the Tribunal\u2019s approach, there is necessarily a heavy burden upon the applicant to establish a manifest excess of powers. The Committee must determine the reasonableness of the Tribunal\u2019s approach in light of the evidence and submissions which were before the Tribunal, and not on the basis of new evidence.\n\n**b) Parties\u2019 Submissions**\n---------------------------\n\n46.\n\nFraport contends that the Arbitral Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it wrongly refused to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. Fraport alleges that \"the Tribunal refused jurisdiction on the basis of a series of findings of which none are \u2018tenable\u2019, let alone \u2018clearly\u2019 so.\"54 Fraport challenges two findings of the tribunal\u2019s majority:\n\n(i) that the BIT required, as a jurisdictional prerequisite, that investments had to be made in accordance with Philippine Law at the time the investment was made; and\n\n(ii) that Fraport\u2019s investments were not in accordance with the Philippine Anti-Dummy law, a criminal statute.55\n\nMemorial, para. 46.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n47.\n\nFraport asserts that neither of these propositions has any reasonable basis. In Fraport\u2019s view and contention,\n\n\"the Tribunal:\n\n(i) disregarded the express language of the BIT, remaking it to fit the Tribunal\u2019s own conception of what the BIT should, but does not, say;\n\n(ii) failed to apply the BIT to each of Fraport\u2019s discrete investments; and\n\n(iii) distorted the requirements of Philippine criminal law, in breach of fundamental norms of public international law, in order to find an imagined violation by Fraport based upon the potential for unlawful acts pursuant to a shareholding agreement that was amended prior to the occurrence of any unlawful act.\"56\n\nFraport\u2019s criticism of the majority conclusion on the lack of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is thus three-pronged.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 47.\n\n48.\n\nOn the first prong, namely that the Tribunal allegedly disregarded the express language of the BIT, Fraport puts emphasis on Article 1(1) of the BIT. It quotes what it considers to be a relevant part:\n\n\"The term \u2018investment\u2019 shall mean any kind of asset **accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of** either Contracting State, and more particularly, though not exclusively...\" (emphasis added by Fraport).\n\nFraport argues that the Tribunal ignored the word \"accepted\" in Article 1(1) and failed to interpret that provision in accordance with its ordinary meaning as required by Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.57\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 50.\n\n49.\n\nFraport agrees that \"the BIT permits the Philippines to put in place laws and regulations that regulate its acceptance of assets as investments.\"58 But in its view, \"to the extent no legal regime for the acceptance of foreign investments exists, the requirement in the treaty can refer only to legal requirements for certain types of property rights under host state Law.\"59 Fraport further adds that the ordinary meaning of the BIT comports with Philippine law, which has set up \"an acceptance regime for certain types of investments requiring certain conditions to be met for admission of investments.\"60 Fraport, however, notes that its investment did not require homologation under this regime to be accepted.61 Fraport maintains that the ordinary meaning of the treaty in light of the statutory regime in place in the Philippines on its face shows that the Tribunal was vested with jurisdiction *ratione materiae* on account of the acceptance requirement in Article 1(1) of the BIT. In its view, \"any issue of legality that the majority believed to exist with respect to any investment of Fraport could have been relevant only to determinations about the merits or compensation.\"62\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 51.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 53. Fraport specifically refers to Republic Act N\u00b07042, entitled \"An Act To Promote Foreign Investments, Prescribe the Procedures For Registering Entreprises Doing Business in the Philippines And For Other Purposes\", as amended, known as the \"Foreign Investment Act of 1991\".\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n50.\n\nFraport is particularly critical of the majority\u2019s statement in the Award that\n\n\"(i) the BIT explicitly and reiteratedly required that an investment, in order to qualify for BIT protection, had ***to be*** in accordance with the host state\u2019s law.\"63\n\nIn Fraport\u2019s view, the majority \"erased\" the word \"accepted\" from the definition of investment in Article 1(1) of the BIT.64 It goes as far as asserting that the \"Majority removed an operative word from the BIT to reach its desired result.\"65 Fraport contends that \"the BIT does not define an investment as an investment made in accordance with law.\"66 Fraport points to the fact that the Tribunal replaced the express words of the BIT in Article 1(1) \"any kind of asset accepted in accordance with the law\" by its own formulation \"any kind of economic transaction made in accordance with the law,\"67 which, according to Fraport, are two different things. Fraport submits that the relevant language of the BIT operates as an admission provision, and not as the majority construed it as a legality requirement provision.68\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 54. The quote is from para. 398 of the Award, emphasis added by Fraport.\n\nReply, para. 19.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 38.\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 58.\n\nMemorial, para. 61.\n\n51.\n\nThe second prong of Fraport\u2019s challenge of the Award on account of the alleged manifest excess of power consists of the assertion that the Tribunal failed to apply its jurisdictional analysis to its discrete investments.69\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 72-84.\n\n52.\n\nFraport explains that it made investments not only through the purchase of the shares but also provided loans to PIATCO, PTI, PTH and PAGS and guarantees (securing loans granted by banks to PIATCO). It criticizes the majority for having reached the conclusion that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction solely on the basis of Fraport\u2019s conduct (namely the entry of secret shareholder\u2019s agreements on 6 July 1999) which concerned only part of its investments consisting of shares, but had nothing to do with its other investments (such as Fraport\u2019s shareholdings themselves, loans and guarantees). It adds that it had made successive investments in the 1999-2001 period, some of them after the amendments of the provisions, deemed by the majority as offensive, of the shareholding agreement on 23 August 2001.70\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 82; Reply, para. 35.\n\n53.\n\nThe third prong of Fraport\u2019s challenge of the award as being the result of the manifest excess of power by the Tribunal is directed against the Tribunal\u2019s allegedly wrong application of Philippine law, the Anti-Dummy Law, as a precondition to its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under the BIT and against \"an untenable interpretation of that Law.\"71\n\nMemorial, para. 87.\n\n54.\n\nFraport argues that \"the majority improperly extended the reach of the Philippine Anti-Dummy Law, a criminal statute, to impute a violation to Fraport, where there clearly was none\" and \"[i]n doing so, the majority declined jurisdiction on a manifestly erroneous basis.\"72\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 88, 90.\n\n55.\n\nIn order to follow the argument of Fraport on this point, it is useful to quote Section 2-A of the Anti-Dummy Law, which Fraport according to the majority of the Tribunal \"knowingly and intentionally circumvented\"73 and thus committed its violation which \"could not be deemed to be inadvertent and irrelevant to the investment.\"74\n\nThe pertinent section reads as follows:\n\n\"Section 2-A - Unlawful use, exploitation or enjoyment:\n\nAny **person, corporation, or association** which, having in its name or under its control, a right, franchise, privilege, property or business, the exercise or enjoyment of which is expressly reserved by the Constitution or the laws to **citizens** of the Philippines or of any other specific country, or to **corporations or associations** at least sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by such citizens, permits or allows the use, exploitation or enjoyment thereof by a **person, corporation or association** not possessing the requisites prescribed by the Constitution or the laws of the Philippines;\n\nor leases, or in any other way, transfers or conveys said right, franchise, privilege, property or business to a **person, corporation or association** not otherwise qualified under the Constitution, or the provisions of the existing laws;\n\nor in any manner permits or allows any **person,** not possessing the qualifications required by the Constitution, or existing laws to acquire, use, exploit or enjoy a right, franchise, privilege, property or business, the exercise and enjoyment of which are expressly reserved by the Constitution or existing laws to citizens of the Philippines or of any other specific country, **to intervene in the management, operation, administration or control thereof, whether as an officer, employee or labourer therein with or without remuneration except technical personnel whose employment may be specifically authorized by the Secretary of Justice,**\n\nand any **person who knowingly aids, assists or abets in the planning consummation or perpetration of any of the acts herein above enumerated**\n\nshall be punished by imprisonment for not less than five nor more than fifteen years and by a fine of not less than the value of the right, franchise or privilege enjoyed or acquired in violation of the provisions hereof but in no case less than five thousand pesos:\n\nProvided, however, That the **president, managers or persons in charge** of **corporations, associations or partnerships** violating the provisions of this section shall be criminally liable in lieu thereof:\n\nProvided, further, **That any person, corporation or association** shall, in addition to the penalty imposed therein, forfeit such right, franchise, privilege, and the property or business enjoyed or acquired in violation of the provisions of this Act:\n\nAnd Provided, finally, That the election of aliens as members of the board of directors or governing body of corporations or associations engaging in partially nationalized activities shall be allowed in proportion to their allowable participation or share in the capital of such entities.\"75\n\nAward, para. 401.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 398.\n\nThe text of Section 2-A is quoted in para. 349 of the Award. It consists of a single complex sentence. Broken into paragraphs, as above, in order to facilitate the reading, it appears in para. 92 of the Memorial (emphasis by Fraport).\n\n56.\n\nFraport argues that it did not possess the necessary quality as perpetrator of the violation of the ADL\u2019s Section 2-A as it did not fulfil the *ratione personae* conditions of Section 2-A. The Award, Fraport contends, makes no finding that Fraport had in its name or under its control a right, franchise, privilege, property or business subject to nationality restrictions and permitted or allowed any person, corporation or association not possessing the nationality condition to intervene in the management, operation, administration or control of such right, franchise, privilege, property or business.76\n\nMemorial, paras. 93 and 95.\n\n57.\n\nFraport further points to the *actus reus* under Section 2-A which it interprets as consisting of permitting or allowing a third party to intervene in the management, operation, administration or control of a public utility concession falling within that Section.77 Fraport stresses that the Award fails to establish the existence of the *actus reus78*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 98.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 98 and 100.\n\n58.\n\nFraport further submits that it could not have violated Section 2-A as an aidor, assister or abettor as \"there can be no crime of aiding, assisting or abetting in the absence of a criminal act committed by a principal.\"79 It maintains that \"[i]f there is no principal, there can be no accessory.\"80 Fraport points out that the Tribunal\u2019s majority failed to find any wrongful act by a principal. It further adds that in any case the accessory has to be a natural person.81 With reference to the Philippine Supreme Court decision in *Agan* Case, which held the Terminal 3 concession as null and void *ab initio,* Fraport draws the conclusion that the ADL was ipso facto inapplicable.82\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 101.\n\n*Ibid. See also* Reply, para. 46.\n\nMemorial, para. 107.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 106; Reply, para. 51.\n\n59.\n\nFraport finally submits that the Tribunal\u2019s majority extended the scope of the law rather than applied it as written. It quotes a following passage from the award:\n\n**\"a literal interpretation [of the law] here could produce an absurdity:** an alien would violate the ADL if its designated officer intervened to manage and control matters A, B, and C, but the same alien would not violate the ADL if it secretly intervened as a shareholder to manage and control the same matters. **The Tribunal construes this part of the ADL as covering intervention by** **shareholders, if that is the actual means of intervening in \u2018the management, operation, administration or control\u2019 of PIATCO.\"83**\n\nMemorial, para. 110. The quotation is from para. 356 of the Award (emphasis added by Fraport).\n\n60.\n\nIn Fraport\u2019s view such expansive interpretation of the ADL violated mandatory norms of public international law. Fraport argues, relying on the Expert Opinion of Professor Antonio Cassese,84 that it is not possible for a tribunal, including an international arbitral tribunal, to interpret and apply national criminal law extensively, even when, as in the case at hand, it is only being applied *incidenter tantum.85* In doing so, Fraport contends, the Tribunal\u2019s majority violated the principle *nullum crimen sine lege* which, in its view, forms part of *jus cogens.86*\n\nExpert Opinion of 9 September 2008 \"How International Tribunals Should Incidentally Apply National Criminal Law\", submitted by Fraport with its Memorial, (hereinafter *\"Cassese* 1\").\n\nMemorial, para. 123.\n\n*Ibid.,* Fraport relies on the view of Professor Cassese who states that \"[i]t is widely accepted that the *nullum crimen sine lege* principle has become a general rule of international law, and is in addition endowed with the legal force of peremptory norms *(jus cogens)\", Cassese 1,* para. 14.\n\n61.\n\nFraport concludes that the Tribunal\u2019s majority, by disregarding the *nullum crimen* principle and thus violating international *jus cogens,* manifestly exceeded its powers87.\n\nMemorial, para. 142.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent the Republic of the Philippines, maintains, that \"the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers in declining to exercise jurisdiction over Fraport\u2019s claims.\"88 It argues that \"[t]he Tribunal ruled correctly as to its jurisdiction, articulating an interpretation of the parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration in the BIT that fully accords with the principles set forth in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and certainly was tenable.\"89\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 9.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 9, also para. 79.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent denies Fraport\u2019s argument that the Tribunal ignored the word \"accepted\" in Article 1(1) of the BIT. It emphasizes that the words in a treaty are to be interpreted in their context and recalls the Tribunal\u2019s observation that \"Article 31 of the Vienna Convention... enjoins the interpretation of particular provisions in their context, i.e., with reference to the rest of the treaty and in light of its objects and purposes.\"90\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 82 quoting para. 339 of the Award.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent contends that \"the Tribunal came to the tenable conclusion that the language of both Articles 1 and 2 refer to the temporal requirement that an investment must comply with host State Law at \u2018the initiation of the investment\u2019,\"91\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 88, referring to para. 345 of the Award.\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent further rejects Fraport\u2019s allegation that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers applying Article 1(1) of the BIT incorrectly. The Respondent maintains that the Tribunal\u2019s application of Article 1(1) was tenable.92 It points to the holding of the Tribunal that Article 1(1) required that economic transactions undertaken by a national of one of the parties to the BIT had to meet certain legal requirements of the host state in order to qualify as an \u2018investment\u2019 and fall under the Treaty.93 As the Tribunal considered that an asset accepted in accordance with Philippine law need not only refer to a single asset, but plainly may refer to a bundle of rights, particularly when it is a bundle of inter-related rights acquired in a single transaction, as it was in the case of Fraport which, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, agreed to acquire equity interests on the basis that it would enjoy related rights of control, the Respondent maintains that the Tribunal, when it concluded that the bundle of rights so acquired by Fraport violated requirements under Philippine law and Fraport\u2019s \"investment\" thus was not covered by the BIT, did not manifestly exceed its powers.94\n\n*Ibid.,* paras 114-118, 124-128.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 118 referring to para. 340 of the Award\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 117 and 118.\n\n66.\n\nIn reply to Fraport\u2019s contention that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to consider Fraport\u2019s \"other discrete\" investments, including additional purchases of equity and loans and guarantees contributed over time to the project, the Respondent argues that \"there is no basis to require a tribunal to treat separate elements of an investment in separate categories or on a per unit basis, and then to make separate jurisdictional determinations accordingly.\"95 The Respondent is of the view that the Tribunal, having found that Fraport\u2019s investment in the project was initiated unlawfully and thus was not accepted in accordance with Philippine law, acted fully consistently with the BIT and the ICSID Convention when it decided not to treat subsequent contributions to the \"tainted project\" as separate investments.96\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 125.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 128.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects Fraport\u2019s view that the Award is based on an untenable interpretation of the Philippine Anti-Dummy Law (ADL), that the majority improperly extended the reach of that Law and thus declined jurisdiction on a manifestly erroneous basis.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 1(1) of the BIT limits the scope of its consent to arbitrate. The scope of the consent was to be determined as a matter of international law, according to the Respondent. Although Article 1(1) contains, in Respondent\u2019s view, \"a renvoi\" to Philippine law, that law - it argues - was not directly applicable but rather was to be consulted to assess in good faith what investments were intended to be covered by the BIT\u2019s protection.97\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 145.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that an erroneous application of law, even if manifest, does not provide a ground for annulment. With reference to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention, it recalls that a proposal to insert a \"manifestly incorrect application of the Law\" as a ground for annulment was expressly considered and rejected.98\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 149, referring in p. 276 to *History of the ICSID Convention,* Vol. II-2 at pp. 853-854.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that the Tribunal devoted over twenty pages to an analysis of the ADL and to the evidence presented that Fraport\u2019s investment \"was in violation\" thereof. It takes the view that this \"extensive attention... devoted to the ADL and its application in the present case should foreclose any further inquiry as to whether the Tribunal applied the Law.\"99\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 154.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the arguments of Fraport that it could not have breached Section 2-A of the ADL as a principal, explaining that the Tribunal concluded that Fraport\u2019s investment was made in violation of the ADL\u2019s provision on aiding and abetting the planning, consummation or perpetration of acts prohibited by the ADL.100 Further, it adds that Fraport\u2019s various arguments on issues relating to the ADL \"are in the nature of appeals that the Tribunal was mistaken in its application of the ADL.\"101\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 159.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 162.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent considers the arguments of Fraport that the Tribunal\u2019s decision violated the rule *nullum crimen sine lege,* which Fraport considers to be part of *jus cogens,* as being \"without merit\".102 In the Respondent\u2019s view, *nullum crimen sine lege* does not apply to the determination by an international tribunal of the scope of its jurisdiction over an investment dispute.103 Relying on the Expert Opinion of Professor Pocar, it maintains that \"this rule is limited to cases when statutes are applied in order to establish the individual criminal responsibility of an accused.\"104\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 180.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 183.\n\n**c) The Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Committee starts its analysis with the observation that this is a case which concerns the interpretation of a treaty, *in concreto* of the Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of the Philippines, for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, concluded on 18 April 1997. Whether the Arbitral Tribunal was endowed with jurisdiction to decide the claims brought by Fraport depends on the interpretation of this BIT. The Committee notes that for the proper construction of the BIT, the rules of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties are relevant; they are directly applicable as conventional rules since both Germany and the Philippines had been parties to it at the moment when they concluded the BIT in 1997.105\n\nThe Philippines ratified the Vienna Convention on 15 November 1972: Germany on 21 July 1987. Article 4 of the Vienna Convention provides: \"Without prejudice to the application of any rules set forth in the present Convention to which treaties would be subject under international law independently of the Convention, the Convention applies only to treaties which are concluded by States after the entry into force of the present Convention with regard to such States.\"\n\n74.\n\nThe relevant Articles of the Vienna Convention for the interpretation of treaties are contained in Articles 31-33. The Committee considers sufficient to quote the text of Article 31. Article 32 concerns supplementary means of interpretation when the interpretation according to Article 31 leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. One of the supplementary means specifically mentioned in Article 32, namely the preparatory work of the treaty, has not been brought to the attention of the Arbitral Tribunal. In the course of the annulment proceeding, Fraport submitted three diplomatic notes106 exchanged between Germany and the Philippines in the process of their negotiating the BIT. They had not been submitted to the Tribunal. Even if they were to be deemed as bearing on the interpretation of the BIT, the Committee is of the view that it would not have been appropriate to have recourse to them in the context of the annulment proceeding. The Committee considers that it has to review the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the BIT in light of the record concerning that Treaty which was available to the Tribunal. Article 33 of the Vienna Convention (Interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages) is of little practical use in the instant case as the parties, which concluded the BIT in the German, Filipino and English languages, all three texts being authentic, expressly agreed that \"in case of divergent interpretation of the German and Filipino texts, the English text shall prevail.\"\n\nApplication for Annulment, Annex F-3.\n\n75.\n\nArticle 31 of the Vienna Convention reads as follows:\n\n**General rule of interpretation**\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context;\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n76.\n\nBefore proceeding further, a word of caution is needed. The Applicant\u2019s criticism of the interpretation of the BIT\u2019s provisions by the Tribunal and its suggestion of a different interpretation cannot be decisive. The task of the Committee is not to pronounce itself on which interpretation is better or more plausible. If the Committee were to proceed in this way, it would have been treating, as the International Court of Justice observed, \"the request as an appeal and not as a *recours en nullit\u00e9.\"107* The role of the Committee is rather to inquire whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to exercise its jurisdiction. The International Court of Justice has stated that \"[s]uch manifest breach might result from, for example, the failure of the Tribunal properly to apply the relevant rules of interpretation of the Arbitration Agreement which govern its competence.\"108 In the present case, such arbitration agreement relied upon by Fraport is the BIT.\n\n*Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989 (Guinea-Bissau* v. *Senegal) I.C.J. Reports 1991,* p. 69, para. 47.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 48.\n\n77.\n\nThe BIT, in its Article 9, provides for ICSID jurisdiction. Article 9 reads as follows:\n\n**\"Settlement of disputes between a Contracting State and an Investor of another Contracting State.**\n\n1) All kinds of divergencies between a Contracting State and an investor of the other Contracting State concerning an investment shall be settled amicably through negotiations.\n\n2) If such divergencies cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article within six months from the date of request for settlement, the investor concerned may submit the dispute to:\n\na) the competent court of the Contracting State for decision;\n\nb) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes through conciliation or arbitration, established under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, of March 18, 1965 done in Washington D.C.\n\n3) Neither Contracting State shall pursue through diplomatic channels any matter referred to arbitration until the proceedings have terminated and a Contracting State has failed to abide by or to comply with the award rendered by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\n4) The award shall be binding and shall not be subject to any appeal or remedy other than those provided for in the said Convention. The award shall be enforced in accordance with domestic law.\"109\n\nUnited Nations Treaty Series (*\"UNTS* \"), Vol. 2108, p. 24.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s objection to the jurisdiction of ICSID, and thus to the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal, was based on the assertion that Fraport\u2019s investment was not an investment within the meaning of that term in the BIT, in other words that Fraport\u2019s investment is not covered by the BIT, as it allegedly was not made in compliance with Philippine law.110\n\nAward, paras. 285,289.\n\n79.\n\nSo the critical question for the Tribunal was the determination whether Fraport\u2019s investment was an investment to which the BIT was applicable, whether it was an investment as defined by the BIT.\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal started its analysis by recalling the terms of Article 1(1) of the BIT which reads as follows:\n\n**\"Definitions of Terms**\n\nFor the purpose of this Agreement:\n\n1. The term \"investment\" shall mean any kind of asset **accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State,** and more particularly, though not exclusively:\n\n*a)* movable and immovable property as well as other rights in rem, such as mortgages, liens, pledges, usufructs and similar rights;\n\n*b)* shares of stocks and debentures of companies or interest in the property of such companies;\n\n*c)* claims to money utilized for the purpose of creating an economic value or to any performance having an economic value;\n\n*d)* intellectual property rights, in particular copyrights, patents, utility-model patents, registered designs, trademarks, tradenames, trade and business secrets, technical processes, know-how, and good will;\n\n*e)* business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources;\n\nany alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their classification as an investment.\"111\n\nThe text of Article 1(1) is reproduced in para. 300 of the Award (emphasis added by the Arbitral Tribunal), *see also UNTS,* Vol. 2108, p. 20.\n\n81.\n\nIt was not disputed by the Respondent that the assets expended by Fraport in the Terminal 3 Project fall within the categories of assets as exemplified, of course not in an exclusive manner, in Article 1(1) of the BIT. The Respondent argued that Fraport\u2019s assets were *not* \"accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of the [Philippines]\". It was for this reason that the Arbitral Tribunal highlighted the quoted formula in the reproduction of the text of Article 1(1) of the BIT in paragraph 300 of its Award. The Tribunal observed \"that as a result of the BIT\u2019s wording, the arguments of both parties address at some length the interpretation to be given to the term \u2018accepted\u2019 used in the BIT.\"112\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 301.\n\n82.\n\nDespite the above observation, the Arbitral Tribunal did not proceed immediately to the interpretation of Article 1(1) of the BIT, and in particular of the words \"asset accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State,\" contained therein.\n\n83.\n\nInstead, the Arbitral Tribunal focused its attention on what it considered were \"the pertinent facts\"113 of the case. It quoted extensively from a preliminary due diligence report on legal issues prepared for Fraport by the Philippine law firm Quisumbing Torres, from a due diligence report on financial issues prepared for Fraport by KPMG, from Fraport\u2019s final report to its supervisory body, from some of Fraport\u2019s other internal documents, from a confidential shareholders agreement of 6 July 1999 *(\"Pooling Agreement\")* and the Addendum to it. Based on the analysis of these documents and other facts it considered pertinent, the Arbitral Tribunal concluded that it was \"persuaded from Fraport\u2019s own internal and contemporaneous documents that it was consistently aware that the way it was structuring its investment in the Philippines was in violation of the ADL and accordingly sought to keep those arrangements secret.\"114\n\nAward, pp. 142-159, paras. 308-333.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 332.\n\n84.\n\nIt is not for the *ad hoc* Committee to review, within the confines of the annulment proceeding, the consideration of the factual record by the Arbitral Tribunal nor to pronounce on the correctness of the view that \"the way [Fraport] was structuring its investment in the Philippines was in violation of the ADL,\"115 that is to say Philippine Law. When its task is limited to the determination of its jurisdiction, which has been objected to by the Respondent, the Committee observes that a dispute settlement organ should only consider the factual records to the extent necessary to make the determination regarding its own jurisdiction. Which facts are pertinent or relevant for that purpose would depend on the provisions of the legal instrument on which the Applicant wishes to base the jurisdiction of the dispute settlement organ seized of the case. Thus, in an investment treaty case, the provisions of the BIT govern the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. To determine jurisdiction in such a case, it is only necessary to analyse such facts that are relevant to the application of the BIT\u2019s jurisdictional provisions, as properly interpreted (evidently if the case was brought under the ICSID Convention, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention will also apply).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n85.\n\nIn the arbitration under review, the Tribunal first reached certain conclusions on the facts, being convinced, or to use the language of the Tribunal \"persuaded,\" that Fraport \"was consistently aware that the way it was structuring its investment in the Philippines *was in violation* of the ADL.\"116 It thus formed its conviction regarding the conduct of Fraport in relation to the Philippines\u2019 statute, the ADL, without first determining whether the ADL itself, and Fraport\u2019s compliance with that statute, have a role to play in determining the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n*Ibid,* (emphasis added).\n\n86.\n\nHaving thus first looked at the facts, the Tribunal proceeded to the determination of its jurisdiction with the following note:\n\n\"While this factual record is troubling, it does not *eo ipso* mean that the Tribunal is without jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to hear the substance of the claim. The Tribunal\u2019s task is to make this determination in accordance with applicable legal standards.\"117\n\nHaving already been troubled by the factual record, the Tribunal next proceeded to a consideration of these applicable legal standards.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 333.\n\n87.\n\nIn the section titled \"The Applicable Legal Standards,\"118 the Tribunal recalled its earlier observation that \"the BIT at issue... has a jurisdictional limitation *ratione materiae.\"119* The Tribunal thought that there were \"four explicit provisions\"120 which limit its jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* namely Articles 1(1) and 2(1) of the BIT, ad Article 2 of the Protocol to the BIT and a clause in the Philippines\u2019 Instrument of Ratification.\n\n*Ibid.,p.* 160.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 334\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 340, *see* also para. 339.\n\n88.\n\nWhat do these provisions, identified by the Tribunal as the applicable legal standards, say and how did the Tribunal interpret them?\n\n89.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT provides that \"[t]he term \"investment\" shall mean any kind of asset accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State\". The Tribunal stated that \"[t]he qualification \u2018accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State\u2019 applies to every form of investment covered by the BIT.\"121\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 335.\n\n90.\n\nArticle 2, quoted by the Tribunal, reads as follows:\n\n\"Each Contracting State shall promote as far as possible investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting State and admit such investments in accordance with its Constitution, laws and regulations as referred to [in] Article 1, paragraph 1 [...] \"122\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n91.\n\nThe next provision, identified by the Tribunal as the applicable legal standard, the provision ad Article 2 of the Protocol to the BIT, states the following:\n\n\"As provided for in the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, foreign investors are not allowed to own land in the territory of the Republic of the Philippines. However investors are allowed to own up to 40% of the equity of a company which can then acquire ownership of land.\"123\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 336.\n\n92.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal felt necessary to quote the text of the Philippines\u2019 Instrument of Ratification and further to highlight its second paragraph.124 The Committee considers that for the present purpose it is sufficient to reproduce just the highlighted paragraph of the Instrument of Ratification which reads as follows:\n\n\"Whereas, the Agreement [i.e. the BIT] provides that the investment shall be in the areas allowed by and in accordance with the Constitutions, laws and regulations of each of the Contracting Parties.\"\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 337.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal attached to this part of the Instrument of Ratification a particular importance. In its view, \"[b]ecause the exchange of instruments of ratification puts a treaty into effect in accordance with its terms, the second preambular paragraph emphasized above is particularly important in regard to the issue at bar.\"125\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 338.\n\n94.\n\nThe \"issue at bar\" was the determination of the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal under the BIT; whether Fraport\u2019s investment was an investment within the meaning of the BIT as that term was defined in its Article 1(1); in other words, whether Fraport\u2019s investment falls within the scope *ratione materiae* of the BIT. If it falls within it, the Tribunal would have jurisdiction over the dispute brought to it by Fraport under Article 9 of the BIT. If Fraport\u2019s investment is not an investment within the meaning of the BIT, falling thus outside its scope *ratione materiae,* the dispute would not be within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n95.\n\nThe scope *ratione materiae* of the BIT, and the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, are governed by the provisions of the BIT itself. The provisions of the BIT are controlling, while a preambular paragraph of the Philippines\u2019 Instrument of Ratification is not.126\n\n*See* Transcript, Day 1, 63/ 1-4.\n\n96.\n\nAn instrument of ratification is a unilateral act by which a State expresses, on the international plane, its consent to be bound by a treaty.127\n\n*See ibid.,* 61/ 14-18.\n\n97.\n\nIt is true that through the exchange of the Instruments of Ratification of the Philippines and Germany, respectively, which occurred on 10 July 1997, the BIT entered into force in accordance with its Article 11. But that fact has no bearing on the scope *ratione materiae* of the BIT, nor does it provide any basis for attaching any particular importance to one of the two instruments of ratification.128\n\n*See ibid.,* 62/ 19-22.\n\n98.\n\nThe quoted paragraph of the Philippines\u2019 Instrument of Ratification does not modify the legal effect of the BIT, nor was it established before the Tribunal that such was the intention of the Philippines. It was not formulated as a reservation, something extraordinary in the context of a bilateral treaty, nor as an interpretative declaration intimated to the other Contracting Party to the BIT, Germany, for its acceptance.129\n\n*See* Memorial, paras. 56-57, Transcript, Day 1, 61-63.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal relied heavily on the Philippines\u2019 Instrument of Ratification to determine whether Fraport\u2019s investment fell within the meaning of the BIT.130 The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties is directly applicable to the interpretation of the BIT. However, the Tribunal did not provide any explanation based on the Vienna Convention for attaching so much importance to the Instrument, in its determination of the scope *ratione materiae* of the BIT and its jurisdiction.131\n\n*See* Award, paras. 337-343.\n\n*See* Memorial, paras. 65-66; Reply, para. 25.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal proceeded to the interpretation of the above quoted provisions of Articles 1(1) and 2(1) of the BIT, of the provision of ad Article 2 of the Protocol, and of the second preambular paragraph of the Philippines\u2019 Instrument of Ratification, which it considered as \"manifestly limitations *ratione materiae\",* observing that \"their interpretation is not simple.\"132 It referred to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties as \"enjoin[ing] interpretation of particular provisions in their context, *i.e.* with reference to the rest of the treaty and in the light of its objects and purposes.\"133 The Tribunal observed simply that \"there are three explicit references [to the condition] in the total of 16 provisions in the Treaty and Protocol plus an additional reference in the Instrument of Ratification\", and concluded that \"[t]he parties had in mind explicit constitutional limitations in the Philippines.\"134 One can understand that the Tribunal, from its perspective of assessing Fraport\u2019s investment in the *Philippines,* was focused on the \"constitutional limitations in the Philippines\". However, the provisions of the bilateral treaty operate both ways, unless specifically provided otherwise.135 The BIT uses the formula \"in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State.\" Of the all quoted provisions on which the Tribunal relied, only the one contained in the Protocol, ad Article 2, specifically refers to the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines and the foreign ownership restrictions contained therein.136\n\nAward, para. 339.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*See* Memorial, paras. 56-57.\n\nThe assertion of the Tribunal that \u2018The Instrument of Ratification make[s] that [i.e., \"[t]hat the parties had in mind *explicit* constitutional limitations in the Philippines\"] clear beyond peradventure of doubt\" lacks a basis in the actual text of the Instrument of Ratification. (Award, para. 339, emphasis added).\n\n101.\n\nArticle 31, paragraph 1, of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties requires that a treaty be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the Treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.\n\n102.\n\nFraport is highly critical of the way the Tribunal interpreted Article 1(1) of the BIT, alleging that the Tribunal disregarded the express language of the BIT, in particular the word \"accepted\" in the definition of the term \"investment\".137\n\n*See* paras. 47 and 48 above.\n\n103.\n\nIt is true that the Tribunal never expressly referred to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the BIT when it construed its provisions in order to determine its jurisdiction which had been challenged by the Respondent.138 Rather, it emphasized the object and purpose of the BIT. On the other hand, the Tribunal was certainly aware of the limits of relying on the object and purpose in the interpretation exercise when it observed that:\n\n\"while a treaty should be interpreted in the light of its objects and purposes [encouraging investment], it would be a violation of all the canons of interpretation to pretend to use its objects and purposes, which are, by their nature, a deduction on the part of the interpreter, to nullify four explicit provisions.139\n\n*See* Memorial, paras. 51-53.\n\nAward, para. 340.\n\n104.\n\nFurther, it appears from the Award that the Tribunal did consider the express terms of Article 1(1) of the BIT, including the words *\"accepted* in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State.\" It pointed to some linguistic differences in the German and English versions of the BIT140 but concluded that they do not appear to indicate an intentional nuance and hence be legally significant.141 Then it offered its analysis of Article 1(1) at two different places.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 341.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 342.\n\n105.\n\nFirst, in paragraph 343 of the Award, although the words of Article 1(1) are not expressly used, in particular the word \"accepted\" emphasized by Fraport in its argument, there is no doubt that the Tribunal considered them in its discussion. It starts paragraph 343 with the observation that \"[b]roadly speaking, there are two types of international investments.\" It explains that \"[t]he first is comprised of an investment based on or accompanied by some explicit agreement with or unilateral communication from the host state; the second involves an investment in the market of the host state without an accompanying specific agreement [...] \"142 The Tribunal admits that \"[t]he English version of the BIT might be read as applying Articles 1(1) and 2(1) only to the first type of investment.\"143 But it does not accept such reading of the BIT because, in its views, \"such a construction would seem unreasonable and even doubtful for a number of reasons.\"144 It explains:\n\n\"First, it is unlikely that state parties would insist on compliance with their respective constitutions, laws and regulations only with respect to the first type of investment, but would, at the same time, discharge potential investors from such compliance with respect to the quite common type of investments in the second category. Second, ad Article 2 of the Protocol, which elaborates Article 2 of the Treaty, relates to purchasing shares in a company which might then acquire land in the territory of the Republic. The acquisition of shares by a foreign investor in a domestic corporation is a legal transaction that does not, by its nature, involve some action by the government involving acceptance or permission.... So it would appear that the material restrictions on investments relate both to investments of the first and second types.\"145\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 343, footnote omitted.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n106.\n\nSecond, in another section of its jurisdictional analysis, titled \"The Claimant\u2019s Concealment of the Secret Shareholder Agreements,\"146 the Tribunal specifically addressed Fraport\u2019s argument that the word \"accepted\" in Article 1(1) of the BIT implies an acceptance *r\u00e9gime* for foreign investments to be established by the Contracting States. The Tribunal rejected for several reasons the Claimant\u2019s argument that \"the word \u2018accepted\u2019 in Article 1(1) of the BIT is critical to the operation of that provision and since the Philippines did not establish an acceptance regime, that provision does not apply.\"147\n\nAward, p. 183.\n\nAward, para. 384.\n\n107.\n\nIts first reason was that \"the word \u2018acceptance\u2019 does not appear in the Instrument of Ratification, which simply states that \u2018the Agreement provides that the investment shall be in the areas allowed by and in accordance with the Constitutions, laws and regulations of each of the Contracting Parties\u2019.\"148 As explained above, this reason is not well founded in the rules of interpretation binding upon the Tribunal, as the Philippines\u2019 Instrument of Ratification did not modify the legal effects of the provisions of the BIT which govern the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.149\n\n*Ibid.* The Tribunal repeated in para. 385 of the Award that the Instrument of Ratification makes no mention of \"acceptance\" but speaks only of \"areas allowed by and in accordance with.\"\n\n*See* paras. 94-99 above. *See* Memorial, paras. 56-57.\n\n108.\n\nBut the Tribunal also rejected Fraport\u2019s contention on the basis that \"without regard to that [i.e., the provision of the Instrument of Ratification], it is,..., unreasonable to assume that state parties would incorporate a reiterated insistence on compliance with their respective constitutions, laws and regulations only not to have them apply.\"150 In particular, the Tribunal supported its view, as a matter of treaty interpretation, by reference to ad Article 2 of the Protocol to the BIT,151 which elaborates Article 2 of the BIT itself. In accordance with Article 11(5) of the BIT, the Protocol \"forms an integral part of this Agreement.\" Based on its construction of that provision, the Tribunal expressed the view that there is no need for an acceptance procedure for the purchase of shares, the form of putative investment in Fraport\u2019s case, but that nevertheless \"it is quite clear from the BIT and the Protocol that accordance with the host state\u2019s law is nonetheless required.\"152\n\nAward, para. 384.\n\nCited *supra* para. 91.\n\nAward, para. 385 in which the Tribunal repeats its explanation already provided in para. 343 of the Award and quoted in para. 105 above.\n\n109.\n\nThe point which the Committee understands the Tribunal to be making here is that it would have been unnecessary for the Contracting Parties to add an express qualification to Article 2, recognising that \"investors are allowed to own up to 40% of the equity of company which can then acquire ownership of land\" (a form of acquisition which required no acceptance procedure), if the limitation in Article 2 vis-\u00e0-vis the \"Constitution, laws and regulations\" of each Contracting State applied only in cases where a specific acceptance regime had been put in place. Rather, the Tribunal considered that the need to add this provision supported a broader construction of the requirement, to include other limitations on the making of investments under the law of the respective Contracting States. Such a construction was applied by the Tribunal equally to the definition of the investments protected by the BIT in Article 1(1), a definition to which Article 2 cross-refers.\n\n110.\n\nAn alternative and plausible interpretation of Article 1(1) of the BIT, submitted by Fraport, is that Article 1(1) contemplates the establishment of an acceptance regime. If the investment was accepted by the state under this regime, or, in the absence of an acceptance regime, if it fell within the definition of investment, then, it would constitute an investment for the purposes of the BIT which, being thus applicable to such investment, would provide protection to it (including through arbitration as envisaged in Article 9 of the BIT). On this interpretation, ad Article 2 of the Protocol was required in order to exclude an investment in land from the scope of Article 2 of the BIT. Otherwise such land ownership by foreign investors (being simply prohibited by the Constitution and, thus, not being an investment which could require an acceptance regime) would have been included within the BIT\u2019s protections\u2014the reverse of the objective to which the Philippines was committed under its Constitution. Once this specific exclusion from the scope *ratione materiae* of the BIT had been added, it was necessary to also add the qualification regarding minority shareholders in land-owning companies, since otherwise the exclusion would be inaccurate. Thus, the qualification found in ad Article 2 is neutral, so far as concerns the construction of the meaning of Articles 1(1) and 2 of the BIT, since ad Article 2 does not otherwise suggest that any investment must comply in all respects with Philippine law to fall within the scope *ratione materiae* of the BIT.\n\n111.\n\nBut the Tribunal rejected Fraport\u2019s interpretation. Instead the Tribunal held that \"[p]lainly,..., economic transactions undertaken by a national of one of the parties to the BIT had to meet certain legal requirements of the host state in order to qualify as an \u2018investment\u2019 and fall under the Treaty.\"153\n\nAward, para. 340.\n\n112.\n\nFraport criticizes the Tribunal for its interpretation and construction of the BIT, in particular Article 1(1) thereof. Although this Committee expressed earlier some reservations about the way the Tribunal proceeded in its interpretation exercise, it is not itself empowered to act as an appeal body and substitute its own interpretation of the BIT for the one adopted by the Arbitral Tribunal. It is not for the Committee to decide which interpretation is correct. As long as the interpretation arrived at by the Tribunal is a tenable one, it is not open to the Committee to conclude that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. The Committee, without necessarily endorsing the interpretation of the BIT provided by the Tribunal, considers that the latter\u2019s interpretation, based in particular upon its reading of ad Article 2 to the Protocol, is not untenable. It cannot, therefore, conclude that, by adopting it, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n113.\n\nThe Committee cannot accept the second prong of Fraport\u2019s criticism directed at the Award, namely that the Tribunal failed to apply its jurisdictional analysis to, what Fraport calls, its \"discrete investments\" made after 23 August 2001 when the provision of the secret shareholder agreement of 6 July 1999, deemed by the majority as constituting the violations of the ADL, had been amended. The Committee is of the view that the Tribunal was entitled to treat Fraport\u2019s investment participation in the Terminal 3 Project as a unity pursuing the same objective. The Tribunal by applying its analysis to the investments of Fraport as a whole has not manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n114.\n\nIt remains for the Committee to deal, in this part of its decision, with the third prong of Fraport\u2019s criticism, namely the wrong application of the ADL and its \"untenable interpretation\" by the Tribunal.\n\n115.\n\nThe Committee observes that the ADL, known as the Anti-Dummy Law, is a criminal statute of the Philippines as its official title clearly indicates: An Act to Punish Acts of Evasion of the Laws on the Nationalization of Certain Rights, Franchises or Privileges. If the Tribunal had interpreted Article 1(1) of the BIT as encompassing only those laws which admit investments through an acceptance regime by way of explicit agreement by the host state, then, as a criminal law statute, the ADL would not have played any role in the jurisdictional analysis of the Tribunal. Rather, the Tribunal took the view that \"economic transactions undertaken by a national of one of the parties to the BIT had to meet certain legal requirements of the host state in order to qualify as an \u2018investment\u2019 and fall under the Treaty.\"154 This conclusion perhaps explains why the Tribunal turned to its interpretation of the ADL, although it nowhere expressly stated the ADL contains \"legal requirements\" which \"an economic transaction...had to meet...in order to qualify as an investment.\"\n\nAward, para. 340\n\n116.\n\nThe Committee does not consider it appropriate to review, in the context of an annulment procedure, the findings of the Tribunal that Fraport violated the ADL, or whether it was legally possible for Fraport to be a perpetrator of the violations of the ADL\u2019s Section 2-A. Nor does the Committee express a view on Fraport\u2019s argument that in the absence of a principal offender (who can, as Fraport stresses, be only a Philippine national), Fraport cannot be liable as aider or abettor.155\n\nOn the last point, the Committee observes that the Appeal Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), having set aside R. Krstic\u2019s conviction as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to commit genocide, the most serious crime, found him guilty of aiding and abetting genocide when no principal actor was yet convicted: *Prosecutor v. Radislav Krstic,* Case No.: IT-98-33-A, Judgment of the Appeal Chamber, dated 19 April 2004. It was only in 2010 that the Trial Chamber found V. Popovic and L. Beara guilty of genocide. *Prosecutor v. Popovic et al.,* Case No.: IT-O5-88-T, Judgment of the Trial Chamber of 10 June 2010: the appeal is pending.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Members were not experts in Philippine law. Therefore the interpretation and construction of the Philippine law, to the extent it was relevant, should have been based on the evidence and research as to the actual application of that law by the competent Philippines\u2019 organs. How the Tribunal proceeded on this issue is the subject of the Committee\u2019s analysis in the next section of this Decision.\n\n118.\n\nTo conclude this section, devoted to the question of whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it declared the Centre without jurisdiction and itself without competence to hear the dispute and resolve it, the Committee, applying the test for review as outlined above, is of the view that it would trespass the limits of its annulment powers, transforming itself in an *organe d\u2019appel,* if it were to uphold Fraport\u2019s claim that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n**B. Serious Departure From a Fundamental Rule of Procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe second ground for annulment of the Award relied upon by Fraport in its Application for Annulment is \"that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\", the ground provided for in Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**a) Fraport\u2019s Case**\n---------------------\n\n120.\n\nFraport alleges that the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in two respects:\n\n(a) In disregarding the principles required to be respected in determining whether a criminal law had been violated, specifically the principles of *nullum crimen sine lege* and *in dubio pro reo156* This ground of complaint relates in particular to the manner in which the Tribunal approached the construction of the ADL;\n\n(b) By relying upon evidence admitted after the close of proceedings in denial of Fraport\u2019s right to be heard.157 This ground relates in particular to the Tribunal\u2019s decision to admit evidence from the investigation leading to the decision of the Philippines Special Prosecutor on the criminal complaint concerning Fraport\u2019s alleged breach of the ADL *(\"the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution\"158)* after the closure of the proceedings, without providing the parties with an opportunity to be heard as to the effect of the material produced to the Tribunal.\n\nMemorial, paras. 150-162.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 163-188.\n\nEx RA-36: *NBI v.

Failure to do so amounts to the breach of a fundamental rule of procedure.161\n\n*Cassese 1,* paras. 39-40.\n\nMemorial, paras. 150-162.\n\n*Cassese 1,* paras. 41-42.\n\n122.\n\nIn its Reply, Fraport submits that *in dubio* is a fundamental procedural rule \"necessitated by the application of criminal law in the arbitration\".162 It relies upon a further Opinion of Professor Cassese dated 14 February 2009.163 Professor Cassese opines that international tribunals may need to determine issues relating to the criminal liability of individuals when they apply national criminal law for the purpose of ruling on an issue preliminary and incidental to the public international law dispute. International tribunals are bound to apply national law as interpreted and applied by national courts, unless the national interpretation is manifestly unreasonable. Compliance with the *nullum crimen* principle is required in the Philippines both by the Constitution and by treaties to which the Philippines is party. Fraport submits that such a principle has a *jus cogens* character and binds international tribunals.\n\nReply, para. 95.\n\nSupplementary Expert Opinion on the Incidental Application of Philippine Criminal Law by International Tribunals, (hereinafter *\"Cassese 2\").*\n\n123.\n\nResponding to the argument that *in dubio* cannot apply in international arbitration because it would be contrary to the principle of equality,164 Professor Cassese expresses the view that this distinction is merely semantic, since:\n\n\"[t]he notion of \u2018presumption of innocence\u2019 is intended to convey the idea that nobody can be held to be responsible for any misconduct, whether civil (a tort) or criminal (a penal offence), without his being first heard...\"165\n\nExpert Opinion of Professor F.

Norway168* for the proposition that the criminal presumption of innocence is still applicable in the context of civil proceedings where criminal law features are apparent in the civil court\u2019s reasoning.169\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 205-270, especially at 244-270.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 245/ 6-9.\n\nEx RA-205: ECHR, App No 31283/04, 15 May 2008, para. 51.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 246/ 19-20.\n\n125.\n\nFraport emphasises that the ADL is a criminal statute.170 It submits that the protections of Article 52(1)(d) are not to be reduced to merely technical rules of procedure, but rather include those emanations of the right to a fair trial and those principles of natural justice that govern any kind of legal procedure, including arbitral procedure.171\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 657/ 11-660/ 4.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 674/ 17-22.\n\n126.\n\nFraport submits that the Award shows on its face that the Tribunal did not approach the evidence as to Fraport\u2019s breach of Section 2-A of the ADL applying such a presumption. The Tribunal expressly accepted that a literal interpretation of the ADL would not cover Fraport\u2019s conduct,172 but nevertheless proceeded to find that Fraport had infringed the law by applying the Tribunal\u2019s own view of the proscribed conduct, which found no support in the text of the ADL itself.173 Fraport submits that the Tribunal proceeded on the basis of a \u2018preconviction\u2019 against Fraport, and did not entertain the possibility of doubt, in violation of the principle *in dubio.174*\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 217/ 8, referring to Award, para. 356.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 222/ 4, referring to Award, para. 395.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 263/ 9-20.\n\n***(ii) The right to be heard***\n--------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe second basis on which Fraport alleges that there had been a failure to observe a fundamental rule of procedure is that the Tribunal failed to hear it by way of rebuttal on the significance of new evidence admitted after the closure of proceedings, in breach of its right to be heard.\n\n128.\n\nThe Philippines does not dispute that a failure to accord a right to be heard could constitute a breach of a fundamental rule of procedure,175 thus opening the way to annulment under Article 52(1)(d). The issues under this heading relate to the application of the principle in the context of the procedures in fact adopted by the Tribunal. The essential facts as to these procedures are not in dispute, being a matter of record in the arbitration.\n\n*Cassese 2,* para. 69.\n\n129.\n\nIn its Application for Annulment, Fraport submits that the Tribunal breached this principle in admitting evidence and substantively relying upon it after the close of proceedings without giving Fraport an opportunity to address the new material.176\n\nApplication, para. 88.\n\n130.\n\nThis submission was developed in its Memorial by reference to the documents from the file in the arbitration proceedings.177 Fraport contends, on the basis of this record, that its right of rebuttal in relation to the admission of this evidence has been violated in three respects:\n\n(a) The majority of the Tribunal concluded that Fraport\u2019s transaction counsel, Dr Stiller, had testified falsely in the Philippines without allowing Fraport or the witness to be heard on that serious but untenable ruling;178\n\n(b) The majority made an outcome-determinative, but incorrect, factual characterisation of the record before the Philippine Prosecutor. The majority held that the critical factual question in relation to the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution was whether the secret shareholder agreements had been part of the record and considered by the Prosecutor.179 This question was not disclosed to the parties, who thus did not have an opportunity to confront the evidence upon which the Tribunal relied.180 Fraport argues that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the two such agreements which were dispositive could not have been disclosed to the Prosecutor because of confidentiality agreements in the arbitration was incorrect; and\n\n(c) The majority acknowledged that, if the facts concerning these materials had been different, its decision on jurisdiction would have been different, since it would have accorded effect to an estoppel created by the Prosecutor\u2019s decision that the ADL had not been breached.181\n\n*Infra* paras. 150 and following.\n\nMemorial, paras. 170-175.\n\nAward, para. 368.\n\nMemorial, para. 176.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 183-188, citing Award, para. 387.\n\n131.\n\nIn its Reply,182 Fraport submits that the right to be heard includes the right to confront primary facts.183 Its application on this ground relates to primary facts, and not simply to inferences which the Tribunal might decide to draw from them. The material in question is the decision of the Special Prosecutor and his documentary record.184\n\nReply, paras. 131-152.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 132, citing Counter-Memorial, para. 229.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 133.\n\n132.\n\nAs to waiver, Fraport submits that the Tribunal had informed the parties that the procedure was used merely to complete the record rather than consider it in substance:\n\n\"[T]he Majority changed the purpose for receiving the underlying materials without informing the parties. The change in purpose was not communicated to Fraport, which is why Fraport could not respond and - as a consequence -was denied the right to be heard.\"185\n\n*Ibid,* para. 152.\n\n133.\n\nAt the hearing before the *ad hoc* Committee, Fraport did not further develop its submissions on this issue in opening, resting its case on the written pleadings.186 In reply to the Respondent\u2019s arguments, Fraport addressed the extent of the disclosure as to the shareholder agreements in the record in the arbitration, and before the Philippine Prosecutor.187 It submitted that the Tribunal should have afforded Fraport an opportunity to be heard about the legal question of whether a finding by the Philippine Prosecutor bound the Tribunal and about the factual question of whether the shareholder agreements (including the Pooling Agreement) had in fact been produced to the Prosecutor.188 These questions implicate both the equality of arms between the parties and the opportunity to confront the particular questions of concern to the Tribunal. Each of these are related, but distinct, aspects of the right to be heard.189\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 205/ 20-206/ 2.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 599-624.\n\n*Ibid.,* 602, citing Award, para. 368.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 623.\n\n**b) The Philippines\u2019 Response**\n--------------------------------\n\n***(i) Nullum crimen sine lege/ in dubio pro reo***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe Philippines, in its Counter-Memorial, supported by expert Opinions filed by Professors Pellet, Pocar and Schreuer, submits that the Tribunal did not seriously depart from a fundamental rule of procedure in this respect, since *nullum crimen sine lege* and *in dubio pro reo* are not rules of procedure. Rather *nullum crimen* is a substantive rule, and *in dubio* establishes a standard of evidential proof applicable only to criminal cases.190 In any event, the Philippines contends that the Tribunal had not infringed either principle.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 207-215, relying upon Professor Schreuer\u2019s Legal Opinion dated 13 January 2009, para. 132 (hereinafter *\"Schreuer* 7\"), Professor Pellet\u2019s Legal Opinion dated 13 January 2009, para. 31, (hereinafter *\"Pellet* 7\"), and Professor Pocar\u2019s Legal Opinion dated 12 January 2009, para. 41, (hereinafter *\"Pocar* 7\").\n\n135.\n\nIn its Rejoinder,191 which was accompanied by a further round of supplemental expert opinions, the Philippines develops its submission that *in dubio* and *nullum crimen* are not rules of procedure. Professor Pellet accepts that such principles are general principles of law, but disagrees with the proposition advanced by Professor Cassese that they have a *jus cogens* character.192 He opines that to apply the principles in the context of the issue before the Tribunal would be to mistake the nature of its task, which was not to sentence Fraport for a criminal offence, but to determine the conformity of Fraport\u2019s investment with the relevant provisions of Philippine law.193\n\nRejoinder, paras. 128-136.\n\nProfessor Pellet\u2019s Supplemental Legal Opinion dated 14 July 2009, filed with the Rejoinder, paras. 5-13, (hereinafter *\"Pellet 2\").*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 16.\n\n136.\n\nThis question would have been the same, whether or not the ADL were a criminal statute, since, even if it were not, there would still be \"a legal prescription which needs to be given effect, whatever the sanction of its non-compliance might have been under Philippine law\".194*Nullum crimen* as a general principle of law applies only to criminal proceedings. It finds no recognition in international instruments outside that context.195 When international tribunals have applied it, they have done so in order to assess the conformity of a municipal law or the decision of a municipal court with the international obligations of the state, not to apply the principle to the underlying municipal law case.196\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 17.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 19-23.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 25.\n\n137.\n\nProfessor Pocar adds that the reason why the principle of legality has become a norm of customary international law is in order to protect persons accused of criminal acts from the abuse of state power by judges and prosecutors. He explains:\n\nWhere, outside of criminal proceedings, the values protected by the principle of legality are not in jeopardy, its application is unjustifiable as it would end up protecting one side - the beneficiary of the more restrictive interpretation that this principle entails - over the other without a proper ground for such more favourable treatment.197\n\nProfessor Pocar\u2019s Supplemental Legal Opinion dated 14 July 2009, filed with the Rejoinder, para. 10, (hereinafter *\"Pocar 2\").*\n\n138.\n\nEven if the principle of *nullum crimen* were applicable, this did not necessarily mandate a literal interpretation, since fidelity to the law requires interpretation in the light of the context and purpose of the particular provision.198\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 28.\n\n139.\n\nAt the hearing before the *ad hoc* Committee, the Philippines developed these points.199 It submitted that Article 52(1)(d) was designed to ensure that parties were accorded \"basic guarantees of due process\".200 It argued that Fraport\u2019s submissions in relation to *nullum crimen* and *in dubio* failed for three reasons:\n\n(a) Because both principles only apply in a criminal context, they cannot be considered a fundamental rule of procedure for ICSID purposes;\n\n(b) Even in the criminal context, they can not properly be considered procedural rules; and,\n\n(c) The Tribunal did not in any event contravene either principle, even if they were applicable.201\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 457-515.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 458/ 22\u2014459/ 1.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 463/ 14\u2014464/ 4.\n\n140.\n\nThe Philippines points out that the *in dubio* principle applies in criminal proceedings, as a reflection of the fact that the state has many advantages at its disposal in such proceedings, including compulsory powers to obtain evidence and the right to indict. Moreover, the interest at stake in criminal proceedings is the liberty of the person.202 Neither of these factors is present in international arbitration, and the application of the principles would therefore serve to distort the equality of the parties. It would lead to absurd results if, in order to determine admission in accordance with host state law, the Tribunal were bound to apply a higher standard of proof to more serious violations of the criminal law than to less serious violations of the civil law.203\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 466/ 6\u2014467/ 4.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 471/ 7\u2014472/ 18.\n\n141.\n\nA procedural rule is one which governs the work of the tribunal and the conduct of the proceedings, and not the manner in which it interprets the applicable law or assesses the evidence.204\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 477/ 8-14.\n\n142.\n\nIn the view of the Philippines, the approach of the Tribunal in this case could not be criticized on the ground that it had failed fairly to assess the evidence, since it has been widely held by annulment committees that an arbitral tribunal is its own judge of the admissibility of any evidence, and of its probative value.205 An alleged defect in the Tribunal\u2019s approach to the evidence could not therefore amount to the breach of a fundamental rule of procedure.206\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1).\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2002, 6 ICSID Reports, p. 129, para. 65.\n\n143.\n\nThe Philippines stresses that the fundamental question is simply whether the parties had been treated fairly by the Tribunal.207 It accepts that a failure to accord a fair hearing would constitute a breach of Article 52(1)(d), but submits that this right has not been violated in any respect in the present case.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 841/21-842/ 2.\n\n***(ii) The right to be heard***\n--------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Philippines submits in its Counter-Memorial208 that Fraport did not choose to present detailed submissions on the ADL during the course of the hearing, despite the fact that it was on notice of the importance that the Tribunal attached to the construction of the ADL in the light of the shareholder agreements.209 Then, in its post-hearing written submissions, Fraport did in fact address in some detail the proper construction of the ADL.210\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 216-256.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 224.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 226.\n\n145.\n\nTurning to the position following disclosure of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution, the Philippines submits that:\n\n(a) Fraport was heard on the completeness of the record before the Philippine Prosecutor. Fraport pointed out the incompleteness of the record by letter to the Tribunal.211 In response, the Tribunal invited Fraport to supplement the record by providing the Tribunal with copies of the documents listed in its letter.212 Fraport continued thereafter to make submissions by letter to the Tribunal as to the completeness of the record;213\n\n(b) Fraport was heard on the explanation for the statements made to the Philippines Department of Justice by Dr Stiller, since he had in fact given evidence before the Tribunal as to the construction of the Pooling Agreement, which the Tribunal considered and expressly rejected;214\n\n(c) The factual findings about the Department of Justice\u2019s access to evidence that Fraport claimed were incorrect were not outcome-determinative. Fraport had in fact submitted at the oral hearing that the Philippines had access to the shareholder agreements.215 In any event, the Tribunal expressly pointed out that the knowledge of the Prosecutor many years later was not relevant to the question of whether the Philippines knew of the agreements in 1999, when the investment was admitted.216 Further, the Tribunal did not consider the municipal decision binding upon it;217 and\n\n(d) Finally, the Philippines submits, relying on ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, that Fraport had waived the right to challenge the irregularity of the Tribunal\u2019s proceeding in this regard, not having made such an objection to the Tribunal at the time.218\n\nExRA-59.\n\nExRA-60.\n\nLetter dated 19 April 2007, Ex RA-62.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 239-244.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 248, referring to Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits Transcript (hereinafter *\"Hearing Transcript\"),* (ExRA-63)Day 11,2933/10-16.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 249, referring to Award paras. 344-345.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 250, citing Award, paras. 390-391.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 252-256.\n\n146.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Philippines contends that the Tribunal had respected Fraport\u2019s right to be heard in addition because:\n\n(a) The interpretation of the ADL was within the legal framework of the dispute, since it had been raised in the pleadings and at the hearing;219 and\n\n(b) Fraport had the opportunity to be heard on the evidentiary record before the Philippine Department of Justice:\n\n(i) The Tribunal\u2019s request for production of documents after closure of the arbitral proceedings was proper under Article 43 of the ICSID Convention, even after the closure of proceedings;220\n\n(ii) Fraport had the opportunity to address the completeness of the record. In fact it did so in its correspondence with the Tribunal. The Tribunal\u2019s direction limiting further submissions was fair because it applied to both parties;221 and\n\n(iii) Fraport had waived its right to object. Its correspondence in response to the Tribunal\u2019s request demonstrated that it was well aware of the importance of demonstrating the extent to which the Prosecutor had knowledge of the shareholder agreements.222\n\nRejoinder, paras. 156-158.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 161.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 162-166.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 180-181, citing Fraport letter dated 16 March 2007, Ex RA-57.\n\n147.\n\nAt the hearing before the *ad hoc* Committee, the Philippines submitted that:223\n\n(a) The Philippines had argued that Fraport had violated the ADL in its posthearing submissions, to which Fraport had had an opportunity to reply.224 At the hearing itself and in its post-hearing briefs, counsel for Fraport had, to the contrary, declined to take the allegations in relation to breach of the ADL seriously and to confront them,225 even when the point was put to it expressly by the Tribunal;226 and\n\n(b) As far as the later introduction of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution and file was concerned, the Philippines notes that Fraport had not alleged in the annulment proceedings that the Prosecutor had had access to the Pooling Agreement; merely that he had had access to documents which referred to it. Thus the Tribunal was well entitled to reach the conclusion that this would not be sufficient to persuade the Prosecutor that there was proof of a violation of the ADL.227 The issue was not in any event outcome-determinative, since the Tribunal held that, for an estoppel to arise, the Philippines would have had to have been aware of the Pooling Agreement at the time the investment was made.228\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 518/ 13-560/ 19.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 519/ 8-520/ 15.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 522/ 12-528/ 13.\n\nReferring in particular to the exchange between Arbitrator Reisman, President Fortier and Mr. Nolan, counsel for Fraport, *at Hearing Transcript,* Day 9, 2321/22-2331/ 7 (Ex CA-26).\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 550-552.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 554-557, referring to Award, paras. 344-346, and relying upon *World Duty Free Co Ltd v. Kenya* (Award) ICSID Case No ARB/00/7, 7 October 2006, para. 180.\n\n148.\n\nIn the course of the oral submissions by way of rejoinder, the Philippines responded to two specific questions raised by the *ad hoc* Committee in relation to the ADL prosecution in the Philippines:\n\n(a) First, it accepted (subject to its checking) that the only underlying evidence of law as to the construction of the ADL (as opposed to the statute itself or contemporaneous evidence of fact) relied upon before the Tribunal was two Department of Justice Opinions (Nos 141 and 165229) and the decision of the Supreme Court in *Luzon.230* The Philippines submits that these Opinions went to the question of the construction of the shareholding restriction under the Foreign Investment Act and not to other means of control proscribed by the ADL;231 and\n\n(b) Second, the Philippines informed the Committee that the Department of Justice proceedings in the Philippines were still pending. Since the decisions of the Prosecutors which had been disclosed in the arbitration proceedings, there were pending motions for reconsideration and petitions for review. The DOJ had completed its investigation, but no Criminal Information had been filed.232\n\nOf these, only the latter is expressly cited in the Award at para. 352.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 787/ 15-19. The Philippines subsequently confirmed by letter dated 14 September 2009, in response to the Committee\u2019s query, that these Opinions had not in fact been produced in the record in the arbitration. *See* further *infra* para. 178 and n. 373.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 794-797/ 8.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 851-852.\n\n**c) The Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s Approach**\n---------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nIn the light of these submissions, it is therefore in the first place important for the Committee to consider carefully (i) the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded in relation to the new evidence produced after the oral hearing, and some of it even after the closure of the arbitral proceeding, relating to the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution; and (ii) its significance in the light of the issues found to be dispositive by the Tribunal in its Award.\n\n***(i) Procedural treatment of new evidence on the ADL***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal had closed the arbitral proceedings pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38 on 25 October 2006 in the following terms:233\n\nHaving deliberated the Tribunal, unanimously, denies Claimant\u2019s request of 4 October 2006 for leave to file a further written submission.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the presentation of their case by both parties is now completed and the instant proceedings are hereby declared closed.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order of 18 July 2006, as it pertains to the ongoing expropriation proceedings in the Philippines, remains in effect and Respondent is accordingly directed to keep the Tribunal (and Claimant) informed of the status of those proceedings.234\n\nEx CA-32.\n\nThe reference in the final paragraph was to ongoing proceedings instituted by Fraport in the Philippines for compensation for expropriation, and not to the extant ADL criminal complaint.\n\n151.\n\nThen, on 5 January 2007, the Philippines submitted to the Tribunal the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution dismissing the criminal complaint under the ADL.235 The Philippines stated in its letter that the Prosecutor\u2019s dismissal had been made on the basis of only two publicly available documents, namely Fraport\u2019s Request for ICSID Arbitration and the Report of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee.\n\nEx CA-34.\n\n152.\n\nFraport responded on 8 January 2007 by submitting evidence to show that this statement was incorrect.236 The Prosecutor, Fraport claimed, had in fact had access to extensive witness and documentary evidence, some of which Fraport referred to in its letter.\n\nEx CA-35, Ex CA-37.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal requested Fraport, on 9 January 2007, to produce two documents referred to in its letter of 8 January (and offered to the Tribunal if it so requested) as establishing that the Philippines\u2019 assertion that only two documents have been available to the Prosecutor was incorrect.237 Fraport provided these on 10 January 2007, adding:\n\n\"Please understand that we do not have a full record of the DOJ proceeding.... We do not know the extent to which the DOJ\u2019s decision was premised on other documents and investigative materials in addition to those indicated in the exhibits to this letter.\"238\n\nExRA-49.\n\nExRA-50\n\n154.\n\nThe Philippines replied on 11 January 2007 asserting that: \"[t]he Philippine DOJ, by contrast, has never had the central evidence proving Fraport\u2019s violations of the Anti-Dummy Law,\" including, *inter alia,* the secret shareholder agreements.239 The Philippines claimed that these had been kept from the Prosecutor by reason of the confidentiality order in the arbitration, and Fraport\u2019s own blocking application in the German courts. The letter accepted that further documents in addition to the two original mentioned in its letter of 5 January 2007 had been available to the DOJ. Fraport replied on 12 January 2007, reiterating: \"we do not have a full record of the DOJ proceeding and thus do not know all the documents that were before it.\"240\n\nExRA-5E\n\nExRA-52.\n\n155.\n\nIn these circumstances, on 14 February 2007, the Tribunal directed the Philippines to submit to it additional evidence submitted to the Prosecutor, together with relevant Philippines legislation. The request included \"all documents, transcripts, statements or other evidence received by the DOJ Prosecutor in the course of his investigation.\" The Tribunal expressly stated:\n\n\"The present request is not a decision by the Tribunal to reopen the proceeding under ICSID Arbitration Rule 38. The Tribunal merely seeks to complete the evidentiary record which the Parties have constituted with their attachments to Respondent\u2019s letter of 5 January and Claimant\u2019s letter of 10 January.\n\nUntil further notice, the Tribunal does not wish to receive any submissions with respect to this material from either Party.\n\nAfter considering the documents which it has requested, the Tribunal will determine whether it requires additional clarification from the Parties. In the meantime, it continues its deliberations.\"241\n\nEx CA-38.\n\n156.\n\nWhen the Philippines requested an extension of time to submit these documents, which was opposed by Fraport,242 the Tribunal on 28 February 2007 granted the extension, noting that the documents \"were pertinent to its continuing deliberations\" and that, nevertheless, \"its Decision/Award will be issued within as short a time as possible after submission of these documents.\"243\n\nExRA-54.\n\nExRA-55.\n\n157.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s order, on 14 March 2007, the Philippines submitted a documentary record of more than 1900 pages, stating that this included \"the entirety of the Department of Justice\u2019s Chief State Prosecutor\u2019s file in the Philippine antidummy cases.\"244 The letter continued:\n\n\"The DOJ file does not include the confidential Fraport due diligence documents, final holding report, or the shareholder and loan agreements of PIATCO and Fraport that were presented to the Tribunal in this arbitration and relied upon by Respondent in its submissions.\"\n\nEx RA-56; Award, para. 73.\n\n158.\n\nFurther, on 19 March 2007, the Philippines produced the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution of 15 March 2007 on Reconsideration of his earlier decision.245\n\nExRA-58.\n\n159.\n\nFraport responded on 26 March 2007, referencing a number of documents (comprising evidence given by Fraport officials in the DOJ investigation) which the Philippines had not produced in compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s order.246 Fraport stated:\n\n\"We would be happy immediately to provide copies of the above documents should the Tribunal wish to have them. Most bear stamps indicating receipt by the Philippines Department of Justice. We of course do not know whether there may have been other documents received by the DOJ that the Tribunal also has not received from Respondent.\"\n\nEx CA-40.\n\n160.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal invited Fraport to produce copies of the documents listed in its letter \"in order to complete the evidentiary record.\"247 This Fraport did by return.248\n\nExRA-60.\n\nExRA-61.\n\n161.\n\nThe Philippines responded to Fraport\u2019s letter on 30 March 2007. It produced further documents and gave the following explanation of the omissions in its previous production of documents:\n\n\"The Respondent\u2019s production of documents on 14 March 2007 was the product of an extensive search by lawyers in the OSG [Office of the Solicitor-General] of the DOJ Prosecutor\u2019s files relating to the anti-dummy investigations. The OSG is not a party to the DOJ proceedings and relies on the DOJ for access to these documents. Respondent was informed that its production to the Tribunal was complete. As is the case with government agencies in many developing countries, the Philippine DOJ Prosecutor\u2019s Office is overworked and understaffed, and its recordkeeping can be imperfect. This is the circumstance that Respondent described during the discovery process in this proceeding that necessitated the lengthy and repeated efforts to locate documents in various agencies. Any omission in Respondent\u2019s production was unintentional and inadvertent....\n\nRespondent will supplement its production if any additional responsive documents are located.\"249\n\nEx CA-41, internal footnotes omitted, emphasis added.\n\n162.\n\nFollowing further correspondence from the parties, dealing *inter alia* with allegations as to the extent to which the Prosecutor\u2019s Reconsideration had been procured by the Philippines in order to assist its defence in the arbitration,250 the President of the Tribunal wrote to the parties on 19 April 2007 to curtail the need for further correspondence.251 The Tribunal repeated and enlarged this direction on 23 April 2007 in the following terms:\n\n\"Until further notice, the Tribunal directs the Parties to cease and desist from sending any further letter to the Tribunal. This also applies to any further update by the Respondent in respect of the ongoing expropriation proceedings in the Philippines.\"252\n\nReferred to in Fraport\u2019s letter of 19 April 2007 (Ex RA-62).\n\nExRA-236.\n\nExRA-239.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal did not communicate further with the parties until, on 13 June 2007, it wrote:\n\n\"[T]he Tribunal is now of the view that the presentation of their case by both parties is completed and accordingly, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38, the proceeding is now declared closed in its entirety.\"253\n\nExRA-240.\n\n***(ii) Consideration of the ADL in the Award***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal referred to two categories of evidence relating to the construction of the ADL in its Award: first, factual evidence from Fraport\u2019s contemporaneous documents relating to legal advice which it had received and its reactions to it; and, second, the evidence from the Prosecutor\u2019s file as to the ADL proceedings.\n\n165.\n\nAs to the contemporaneous evidence of fact, the Tribunal referred to the following:254\n\n(a) A due diligence report from Fraport\u2019s Philippine lawyers, Quisumbing Torres *(\"QTj* dated 11 January 1999;255\n\n(b) A provisional due diligence report from KPMG of 20 January 1999;256\n\n(c) Fraport\u2019s final report to its supervisory body dated 26 February 1999;257\n\n(d) The PIATCO Master Concession Concept Brief of 19 January 1999, which referred to the need to conclude a shareholders\u2019 agreement in accordance with Philippine law;258\n\n(e) The comments by Dr Schmidt recorded in the minutes of a meeting of Fraport\u2019s Supervisory Board;259 a letter dated 18 December 1998 from the Chairman and President of FRAPORT to the Asian Development Bank, one of the Senior Lenders;260 and a letter from Jesse Ang, CFO of PIATCO, to John Archer of Fraport261 which attached the Concept Brief referred to at (d) above;262\n\n(f) The Pooling Agreement dated 6 July 1999 itself263 and the Addendum to that Agreement;264\n\n(g) Questions raised by Mr Vogel of Fraport to QT on 14 December 1999;265\n\n(h) A letter from Mr Struck to QT that followed the SyCip report,266 which indicated concern at the content of QT\u2019s prior advice; and\n\n(i) A further letter from QT dated 21 December 1999.267\n\nAward, paras. 308-333.\n\nExRA-8.\n\nExRA-96.\n\nExRA-9.\n\nAward, para. 314.\n\nExRA-10.\n\nExRA-95.\n\nExRA-97.\n\nAward, paras. 315-318.\n\nExRA-23.\n\nExRA-24.\n\nAward, para. 324.\n\nExRA-12.\n\nAward, para. 325.\n\n166.\n\nThe evidence as to the ADL proceedings to which the Tribunal referred was as follows:268\n\n(a) In 2003, two Philippine lawyers, Messrs. Balayan and Bernas complained to the National Bureau of Investigation *(\"NBI\")* that the officers and directors of Fraport and PIATCO had violated the ADL based on Fraport\u2019s ownership of 61.44% of PIATCO\u2019s shares. The Complaint was based solely and expressly on statements made by Fraport in the Request for ICSID arbitration;269\n\n(b) The NBI Report, issued on 10 June 2004,270 found that the Supreme Court\u2019s annulment of the PIATCO concession occurred before Fraport could exercise any managerial control it could have acquired in violation of the ADL. The 10 June 2004 report was followed by Reports dated 13 February 2006,271 13 June 2006272 and 16 June 2006273 and Evaluation Comments dated 28 July 2006;274and\n\n(c) On 27 December 2006, the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution rejected the NBI\u2019s recommendation to prosecute the officers and directors of Fraport and PIATCO for their \"intent\" to breach the ADL.275\n\nAward, paras. 357-382.\n\n*Ibid,* paras. 357-359.\n\nEx RA-132.\n\nExRA-133.\n\nEx RA-134.\n\nExRA-135.\n\nExRA-136.\n\nExRA-36.\n\n167.\n\nAgainst that background, the Tribunal turned, in Part V Section D of its Award, to a consideration of its interpretation of the ADL. The Tribunal held that Fraport had not infringed the level of equity investment permitted to a foreign investor in a Philippine public utility.276 But it found that an ADL violation might alternatively be established by\n\n\"an actual demonstration of managerial control, in which case the quantum of equity in the company is irrelevant.\"277 The Tribunal accepted that managerial control by means of a shareholder meeting did not infringe a literal interpretation of the ADL. But it decided:\n\n\"[A] literal interpretation here could produce an absurdity.... The Tribunal construes this part of the ADL as covering intervention by shareholders, if that is the actual means of intervening in \"the management, operation, administration or control\" of PIATCO.\"278\n\nAward, para. 350.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 354.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 356.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal then considered, in Section E of the Award, the ADL Proceedings in the Philippines. Noting that the Prosecutor had, by his Report of 27 December 2006, rejected the recommendation of the NBI that Fraport and its officers be prosecuted for their intent to violate the ADL, the Tribunal repeatedly observed that the Report did not give \"any indication of awareness of the actual secret shareholder agreements by which the management and control prohibited by the ADL was effectively assigned to Fraport.\"279\n\n*Ibid,* para. 367; *see also* para. 377.\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal then stated that it had decided:\n\n\"to review the full record of evidence regarding the ADL proceedings which resulted in the Department of Justice\u2019s Chief State Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution of 27 December 2006 (the \"Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution\") dismissing the Bernas and Balayan complaints. Accordingly... it requested all of those documents from the Respondent, and the Claimant supplemented the record with other documents.\"280\n\n*Ibid,* para. 368.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal continued by citing an extensive extract from the letter from the Philippines to it dated 11 January 2007 in which the latter submitted that its Department of Justice had never had the central evidence as to the secret shareholder agreements. The Tribunal conducted its own review of the Prosecutor\u2019s Report and those documents in his file which had been produced to and inspected by the Tribunal. It concluded from that review that, although there were references to Fraport\u2019s control of PIATCO and some shareholder agreements, there was no evidence that the Prosecutor had seen the critical secret shareholder agreement, namely the Pooling Agreement.281\n\n*Ibid,* paras. 369-373.\n\n171.\n\nThe Tribunal then cited from evidence filed by Dr. Stiller in the ADL Proceedings on 8 December 2006 and 19 January 2007, contrasting it with Dr. Schmidt\u2019s advice to the Fraport Board of 7 March 1999.282\n\n*Ibid,* paras. 372-374.\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal pointed out that the Complainants may have suspected that there was a conspiracy on the part of Fraport to control PIATCO, but found that they had not had access to the secret shareholder agreements. Thus the Tribunal observed:\n\n\"Not surprisingly, the theories put forward by Bernas and Balayan, without the benefit of the secret shareholder agreements, could not and did not persuade the DOJ Prosecutor. As every lawyer knows, to bring an indictment and initiate a criminal prosecution, one needs evidence and not theories. The evidence was to be had in the secret shareholder agreements. The ADL charges were accordingly dismissed.\"283\n\nAward, para. 377.\n\n173.\n\nFinally, in this section, the Tribunal referred to Fraport\u2019s letter to it of 16 March 2007, but observed that Fraport was not able to point to the Prosecutor having had access to any of the secret shareholder agreements.284\n\n*Ibid,* para. 381.\n\n174.\n\nSection F of the Award considers the effect of \"[t]he Claimant\u2019s Concealment of the Secret Shareholder Agreements.\" The Tribunal rejected the submission that the issue was not dealt with by the Philippines\u2019 experts on the basis that most of the evidence in relation to it was produced either immediately before or at the hearing itself.285 It held that the Philippines could not be estopped from making the point, as Fraport had concealed the relevant agreements.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 383.\n\n175.\n\nAs a matter of law, the Prosecutor\u2019s decision could not bind the Tribunal, since there was not sufficient identity of parties and claim. The proper extent of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction was a matter for it and it could not be bound as to that question by the decision of a municipal legal institution.286\n\n*Ibid,* paras. 390-391.\n\n176.\n\nBut in any event, Fraport\u2019s submissions were rejected by the Tribunal as a matter of fact. The Tribunal considered that, irrespective of the standard of proof which was applied, \"this is a case in which *res ipsa loquitur.* The relevant facts, all of which are found in Fraport\u2019s own documents, are incontrovertible.\"287\n\n*Ibid,* para. 399.\n\n177.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concluded:\n\n\"Fraport knowingly and intentionally circumvented the ADL, by means of secret shareholder agreements. As a consequence, it cannot claim to have made an investment \"in accordance with law.\"... Because there is no\n\n\"investment in accordance with law\", the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae.288*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 401.\n\n178.\n\nPausing at this point, the Committee observes that:\n\n(a) The Tribunal\u2019s finding that Fraport had infringed the ADL by means of the secret shareholder agreements forms an essential part of the *ratio* of the Award, since, on the view that the Tribunal took of the matter, it is by virtue of that finding that the Tribunal decided that it lacked jurisdiction *ratione materiae;*\n\n(b) The majority of the evidence in relation to that aspect of the matter had not been produced until immediately before or at the hearing, and accordingly its significance was not dealt with in the expert reports on Philippines law;289\n\n(c) The Tribunal\u2019s analysis of illegality under Philippines law is derived from factual evidence both produced before it and before the Philippines Prosecutor. Aside from that material, and apart from the text of the ADL itself, the Tribunal cites only one Department of Justice Opinion as to its construction;290\n\n(d) By contrast to the Award, the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution expressly finds no breach of the ADL by Fraport or its officers; and\n\n(e) The Tribunal therefore had to find, and did find, *both* that the Prosecutor had not had access to the secret shareholder agreements *and* that, had he had such access, he would likely have found a breach of the ADL, in order to reject the significance of the evidence of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution for what it considered to be the central issue before it. This required the Tribunal to consider the entirety of the file of evidence collected by the Prosecutor and the terms of his Resolution.291\n\nAward, para. 383.\n\nDOJ Opinion No 165 (1984), cited at para. 352 of the Award. In fact this Opinion was not produced to the Tribunal (as the Philippines accepted before the *ad hoc* Committee by its letter of 14 September 2009 in response to the Committee\u2019s query raised in its letter of 10 September 2009). The document described as DOJ Opinion No 165 s. 1984 exhibited at RA-217 (Mendoza Ex 82) is not a copy of the Opinion of 1984, but rather a note purporting to apply the badges of dummy-ship in the Opinion to the facts of the *Fraport* case.\n\nArbitrator Cremades in his Dissenting Opinion observed, *inter alia,* that the Prosecutor had expressly rejected any test for control under the ADL other than shareholding (para. 16). He opined at para. 23 that the majority \"infers a crime from the Claimant\u2019s legal advice, rather than from a careful examination of its actions in light of the text of the [ADL].\"\n\n179.\n\nAll of this material was produced after the oral procedure and the Tribunal did not permit submissions from the parties on it.\n\n**d) The Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n***(i) Construction of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe object and purpose of the power to annul an award for \"a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" is to control the integrity of the arbitral procedure,292 a formulation accepted in the present case by both parties.293 With this object in mind, Article 52(1)(d) contains the twin requirements that the rule of procedure must be fundamental and that the departure from it must be serious.\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE,* Decision on Annulment, 5 June 2007, para. 23.\n\nApplicant, Transcript, Day 1, 50/ 12-51/ 21; Philippines, Transcript, Day 2, 307/ 17-308/ 3.\n\n181.\n\nThe Convention does not define \"a fundamental rule of procedure.\" This ground of annulment was taken with little amendment294 from Article 35(c) of the Model Rules on Arbitral Procedure prepared by the International Law Commission.295 It was adopted unanimously by the Commission in 1952.296\n\n*History,* Vol. I, pp. 230-2.\n\n*Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1958,* Vol. II, p. 86.\n\n*Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1952,* Vol. I, p. 87, para. 61.\n\n182.\n\nThe importance of this safeguard is explained in the *Commentary* to the International Law Commission\u2019s Model Rules:\n\n\"It is not the fact alone that the *compromis* may provide that the award is binding on the parties which makes it so binding. The view of States that international law makes an arbitration award binding, *the circumstance that the tribunal faithfully has adhered to the fundamental principles of law governing its proceedings,* these are the ultimate sources of the binding authority of an international arbitral award. States are required to take all necessary measures to carry into effect an award so rendered.\n\nThe converse of the foregoing is that an award rendered in violation of such principles is not binding upon the parties.\"297\n\nInternational Law Commission \"Commentary on the Draft Convention on Arbitral Procedure adopted by the International Law Commission at its Fifth Session, prepared by the Secretariat of the United Nations\" (A/CN.4/92), 105 (emphasis added).\n\n183.\n\nThe *Commentary* describes this provision as affirming:\n\n\"the principle that the tribunal must function in the manner of a judicial body and with respect for the fundamental rules governing the proceedings of any judicial body. The paragraph is concerned with *error in procedendo,* not with *error in judicando.* It is, further, concerned with serious departures from fundamental procedural rules rather than minor departures.\"298\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 109.\n\n184.\n\nIn support of this latter proposition, the *Commentary* cites with approval Carlston\u2019s formulation of the issue:\n\n\"Does the departure constitute a deprivation of a fundamental right so as to cause the arbitration and the resulting award to lose its judicial character? Unless its effect is to prejudice materially the interests of a party, the charge of nullity should not be open to a party.\"299\n\nCarlston, *The Process of International Arbitration* (1946), pp. 38-9, cited *ibid.,* pp. 109-110.\n\n185.\n\nThe *Commentary* further confirms that \"[t]he right to be heard, including due opportunity to present proofs and arguments\"300 is one such fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 110, with numerous citations of publicists in support.\n\n186.\n\nThe *travaux* of the ICSID Convention show a consensus that not all rules of procedure contained in the ICSID Arbitration Rules would fall under this concept. Rather, the concept was restricted to the principles of natural justice, including the principles that both parties must be heard and that there must be adequate opportunity for rebuttal.301 This view was also taken by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE v. Guinea302*\n\n*History,* Vol. II-l, pp. 271, 423, 480, 517.\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v. Guinea,* Decision on Annulment, 22 December 1989, 4 ICSID Reports, p. 87, para. 5.06.\n\n187.\n\nThis context to the formulation in Article 52(1)(d) demonstrates that a \"fundamental rule of procedure\" is intended to denote procedural rules which may properly be said to constitute \"general principles of law\"303, insofar as such rules concern international arbitral procedure.\n\nIn the sense of Article 38(1)(c) Statute of the International Court of Justice.\n\n***(ii) Nullum crimen sine lege/in dubio pro reo***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, the question whether the Tribunal committed \"a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" is not to be resolved by applying the principle *nullum crimen sine lege,* or the principle *in dubio pro reo.*\n\n189.\n\nThe principle *nullum crimen sine lege* encapsulates a fundamental human rights principle in the construction of criminal law for the protection of the accused that \"[n]o one shall be held guilty of any penal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a penal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed.\"304\n\nArticle 11(2) Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1947 *(\"UDHR\"),* Article 15(1) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights *(\"ICCPR\")* (16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976). The ICCPR was ratified by Germany on 17 December 1973 and by the Philippines on 23 October 1986. Such a principle is an essential attribute of a state conducting itself in accordance with the Rule of Law: *Consistency of Certain Danzig Legislative Decrees with the Constitution of the Free City (Advisory Opinion)* PCU Rep Ser A/B, No 65 (1935).\n\n190.\n\nThe ADL, by its express terms (\"An Act to Punish Acts of Evasion of the Laws on the Nationalization of Certain Rights, Franchises or Privileges\"305), has as its purpose to prohibit certain acts; to define them as criminal; and to proscribe appropriate sanctions for their commission. It was treated as a criminal statute by the Philippines at the hearing before the Tribunal and by the Tribunal itself.306\n\nExRA-2.\n\nAward, para. 399. The new explanation offered by Justice Feliciano as counsel during the annulment hearing, (Transcript, Day 2, 443/ 14\u2014444/ 9 and 445/ 10\u2014448/ 13) is inconsistent with the record on this point before the Tribunal.\n\n191.\n\nBut it would be a distortion of the important function of the principle to consider it applicable in the present context as a fundamental rule of procedure. The question for the Tribunal was whether the investment was accepted or admitted in accordance with Philippines law, such that the Tribunal was endowed with jurisdiction *ratione materiae.* If a party wishes to argue that an investment was not admitted in accordance with host state law, such an argument inherently requires clear and positive evidence that host state law was not complied with. But the resolution of this question is not assisted by the invocation of a principle which exists in order to prevent the conviction of an accused person for a criminal offence. However important it may be, the principle is not procedural in character. On the contrary, it applies to the determination of the scope of the substantive law.307\n\nIt therefore receives treatment as a right separate to the right to a fair trial in the major international human rights instruments referred to *supra* n. 305.\n\n192.\n\nThe maxim *\"in dubio pro reo\"* also encapsulates an important human rights protection that \"[e]veryone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.\"308\n\nArticle 11(1) UDHR, *supra* n. 305; *see* also Article 14(2) ICCPR, *supra* n. 305: \"Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. \"\n\n193.\n\nBut such a principle cannot be applied in the context of international arbitral proceedings instituted by an investor against a state. Indeed, the application of such a presumption could itself, in the context of ICSID proceedings, amount to a failure of due process since it may unbalance the essential equality between the parties. The principle *in dubio* has proper application as a right of the defence in criminal proceedings, because it counterbalances the coercive power of the state. It cannot, however, be transposed into the context of international arbitral proceedings because to do so would be inconsistent with the principle of equality of the parties.\n\n194.\n\nThe Committee is fortified in reaching this view by the fact that, despite very extensive citation of jurisprudence and doctrine in these annulment proceedings, it was not referred to any arbitral decision in which either *nullum crimen* or *in dubio* had been held by the tribunal to be applicable as a fundamental rule applicable to the procedure before it. Cases in which an international tribunal has been mandated by the parties to investigate whether a national court has met the requisite standards of international law, whether by virtue of a human rights treaty or the customary international law standard of denial of justice, raise an entirely different issue.309 Nor is reference to the principles applicable to the procedure of international criminal tribunals apposite, since such tribunals must, in view of their criminal function, respect the rights of the accused.\n\nAs in the case of the decisions of international tribunals cited in *Cassese 1,* paras. 12-15 and *Cassese 2,* paras. 13-25. *Mondev Int\u2019l Ltd v. United States of America* (Award) (2002), 6 ICSID Reports, p. 181, in which the principle of *in dubio* was considered but not applied, was a case of alleged denial of justice by a national court allegedly giving rise to an investment treaty claim of failure to accord fair and equitable treatment, and is not, therefore, an exception to this point. Nor is the case of *Orr v. Norway,* supra n. 169, of assistance, as that case concerned the particular issue of the relevance of an acquittal in a criminal case for determination of a civil claim in the same proceedings.\n\n195.\n\nIn the end, Fraport accepted in its written pleadings that the essential interest protected by the *in dubio* principle in the context of arbitral proceedings was the right to be heard. Thus, Professor Cassese states in his second Opinion that:\n\n\"[t]he notion of \u2018presumption of innocence\u2019 is intended to convey the idea that nobody can be held to be responsible for any misconduct, whether civil (a tort) or criminal (a penal offence), without his first having been heard...,\"310\n\n*Cassese 2,* para. 69.\n\n196.\n\nThus, the critical question for the Committee to resolve is whether Fraport\u2019s right to be heard was respected by the Tribunal.\n\n***(iii) The content of the right to be heard***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe requirement that the parties be heard is undoubtedly accepted as a fundamental rule of procedure, a serious failure of which could merit annulment. It was expressly referred to as an example of such a rule by the framers of the ICSID Convention and was accepted as such by both parties to the present annulment proceeding.\n\n198.\n\nThe right to be heard has been recognised as a fundamental rule of procedure applicable to international arbitral proceedings generally. It was for that reason that the Annulment Committee in *MINE v. Guinea* stated that:\n\n\"a clear example of such a fundamental rule is to be found in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration which provides:\n\nThe parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given full opportunity of presenting his case.\"311\n\n*Supra* n. 303.\n\n199.\n\nThus Article 34(2)(a)(ii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law further provides that one ground on which an award may be annulled is if the applicant \"was otherwise unable to present his case.\" This provision is in turn closely modeled on Article V(1)(b) of the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, which likewise provides that an award may be denied recognition if the party against whom the award was rendered \"was otherwise unable to present his case.\"\n\n200.\n\nThe right to present one\u2019s case, or \"principe de la contradiction,\"312 in arbitral proceedings includes the right of each party to make submissions on evidence presented by its opponent.313 If an arbitral tribunal fails to accord such a right, then its award will be subject to annulment.314 One example of this principle being applied in the international commercial arbitration context is where the arbitral tribunal has permitted one of the parties to adduce additional documentary evidence after the oral hearing, without giving the other party the opportunity to comment on it.315\n\nGaillard & Savage (eds), *Fouchard, Gaillard, Goldman on International Commercial Arbitration* (1999), pp. 947-948, para. 1638; Poudret & Besson *Comparative Law of International Commercial Arbitration* (2 ed, trans. Berti & Ponti, 2007) paras. 546-554.\n\nBom, *International Arbitration* (2009), pp. 2582-3.\n\n*Ibid,* and the numerous authorities there cited.\n\n*See, e.g., Rice Trading (Guyana) Ltd v. Nidera Handelscompagnie BV* (Hague Court of Appeal) (28 April 1998) (1998) XXIII Ybk Comm Arb, p. 731.\n\n201.\n\nThe same principle also applies in proceedings before Public International Law courts and tribunals:\n\n\"[W]henever there is such new evidence, alteration of the legal basis of the claim, or amendment of the original submission, the other party is always assured of an opportunity to reply thereto, or comment thereon.\"316\n\nCheng *General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals* (1952), p. 295, citing *inter alia Legal Status of Eastern Greenland Case (Denmark v. Norway)* (1933) PCIJ Rep, Ser A/B No 53, pp. 25-6; *Chorz\u00f3w Factory Case (Germany v. Poland)* (1928) PCIJ Rep, Ser A No 17, p. 7, where the Permanent Court afforded a party a further opportunity to be heard on new evidence or submissions submitted by its opposing party. Specific recognition of this principle in relation to submissions made, or evidence produced, after the closure of written and oral proceedings, is given in the Rules of Court of the International Court of Justice, Articles 56 and 72.\n\n202.\n\nThe right to present one\u2019s case is also accepted as an essential element of the requirement to afford a fair hearing accorded in the principal human rights instruments.317 This principle requires both equality of arms and the proper participation of the contending parties in the procedure, these being separate but related fundamental elements of a fair trial. The principle will require the tribunal to afford both parties the opportunity to make submissions where new evidence is received and considered by the tribunal to be relevant to its final deliberations.318 It is no answer to a failure to accord such a right that both parties were equally disadvantaged.319\n\nArticle 10 UDHR, *supra* n. 305; Article 14 ICCPR, *supra* n. 305; Article 6 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms *(\"ECHR\")* (signed 4 November 1950, entered into force 3 September 1953).\n\n*Feldbrugge Case* (29 May 1986) ECHR Ser A, No 99, 8 EHRR 425, para. 44.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n203.\n\nThe right to be heard has found specific application in the only ICSID annulment decision so far to annul an Award under Article 52(1)(d).320 In that case, the ICSID Arbitration Rules expressly required that the decision of the Tribunal in question, a request for rectification, be taken only after an opportunity had been given to the other party to file observations on the request: ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(3). But the *ad hoc* Committee was in no doubt that such a requirement was in any event a fundamental rule, the breach of which was serious.321\n\n*Amco Asia v. Indonesia II,* Decision on Annulment, 3 December 1992, 9 ICSID Reports, pp. 55-56, paras. 9.05-9.10.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 9.08-9.10.\n\n204.\n\nIt is frequently observed in the context of ICSID annulment proceedings that a party may lose its right to object on this ground if it raised no such objection before the arbitral tribunal itself.322 Such decisions have relied upon what is now ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, which provides:\n\n\"A party which knows or should have known that a provision of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, of these Rules, of any other rules or agreement applicable to the proceeding, or of an order of the Tribunal has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed - subject to Article 45 of the Convention - to have waived its right to object.\"\n\n*See, e.g., Kl\u00f4cknerl, supra* n. 53, p. 128, para. 88.\n\n205.\n\nIn the context of the ordinary operation of ICSID arbitration proceedings in accordance with the particular arbitration rules applicable to the proceedings, this provision makes sound practical sense. It supports the validity of the procedure, by ensuring that steps taken by the tribunal stand unless one of the parties objects.323\n\nSchreuer et at, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2009), 920-1.\n\n206.\n\nIn the context of an application for annulment on the grounds of serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, however, Rule 27 gives effect to a more fundamental principle. That is: a party forfeits its right to seek annulment under Article 52(1)(d) if it has failed promptly to raise its objection to the tribunal\u2019s procedure, upon becoming aware of it.\n\n207.\n\nHowever, if such a principle is to be invoked so as to preclude a party from its right to seek annulment for an otherwise serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by the tribunal, the objecting party must know of the conduct of the tribunal and have a reasonable opportunity to raise its objection. This point is, in the view of the Committee, an elementary one, since a party cannot be treated as having waived an objection to a course of action of which it was unaware. As a leading text on international arbitration puts it:\n\n\"[A] breach of due process will only justify an action to set aside or prevent enforcement of an award on condition that the party relying on the breach protested *as soon as it became aware of it. \"324*\n\nGaillard & Savage, *supra,* n. 313, p. 951, para. 1643, emphasis added.\n\n208.\n\nSo, too, Schreuer observes in his *Commentary* on the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"Some violations of procedural principles will be evident to the affected party in the proceeding before the tribunal. *Others may become visible only after the award has become available. A party that is aware of a violation of proper procedure must react immediately* by stating its objection and by demanding compliance.\"325\n\n*Supra* n. 44, pp. 994-5, para. 334, emphasis added.\n\n***(iv) The issue raised by the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of new evidence on the ADL***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, there can be no concern as to the Tribunal\u2019s process up to and including receipt of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution on 5 January 2007. Nor was the contrary suggested by Fraport in its Annulment Application. The issue of the wider construction of Section 2-A of the ADL was raised with the parties by the Tribunal during the hearing.326 It was addressed by both parties, with specific reference to the Pooling Agreement, in their post-hearing briefs.327 The limits imposed by the Tribunal on posthearing briefs and communications were reasonable. A full opportunity to present one\u2019s case does not preclude a tribunal from setting reasonable limits on the timing and scale of both parties\u2019 submissions, provided that, in so doing, it affords the parties equality of treatment. The Committee well understands the practical difficulties faced by arbitral tribunals in achieving finality of the record, especially in the context of heavily-contested arbitral proceedings.\n\nTribunal: *Hearing Transcript* (Ex CA-26) Day 9, 2321/ 22-2331/ 7: Annulment: Transcript, Day 2, 525/ 5-527/20.\n\nEx RA-72-RA-76.\n\n210.\n\nThe position which had been reached on post-hearing briefs was that the Philippines specifically alleged that Fraport had knowingly implemented a scheme to evade the ADL by exercising management and control over PIATCO.328 The Philippines stated that breaches of the ADL are serious and \"may give rise to potential criminal penalties.\"329 But it had conceded at the hearing that it had not commenced a criminal investigation for breach of the ADL, the only such investigation being as a result of a private complaint.330\n\nEx RA-73, paras. 6-38.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 38.\n\n*Hearing Transcript* (Ex CA-26) Day 3, 626/ 10-627/ 22.\n\n211.\n\nAgainst this background, the receipt of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution was, on any view, a highly material development in relation to the issue of Philippine law which the Tribunal ultimately decided was dispositive of the case. That issue was whether \"an actual demonstration of managerial control\" was sufficient to establish a violation of Section 2-A of the ADL, so that \"the quantum of equity in the company is irrelevant.\"331\n\nAward, para. 354.\n\n212.\n\nFor that reason, the Philippines was right to draw it to the attention of the Tribunal, since otherwise the Tribunal could have reached a view on the construction of the ADL without the benefit of the view of the Philippine Prosecutor on the very question at issue.\n\n213.\n\nOne of the allegations made by the private Complainants in the criminal complaint in the Philippines was that Fraport exerted control over PIATCO not simply through an impermissible level of shareholding, but also because it met the various \"badges of dummy status\" covered by DOJ Opinion Nos 141 and 165,332 including \"3. [t]hat the foreign investors, while being minority shareholders, manage the company.\"333 The Complainants alleged that:\n\n\"Using such an ostensible legal set-up, respondent Fraport was able to control and in fact controls the financial, technical and operational aspects of respondent PIATCO through respondents PTH, PTI and PAGS in circumvention and gross violation of the Anti-Dummy Law.\"334\n\nBalayan Complaint-Affidavit, Ex RA-127, paras. 13-20.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 14.\n\n*Ibid.,* 21.2.\n\n214.\n\nBalayan\u2019s Reply-Affidavit specifically alleged, relying on DOJ Opinion No 141, that:\n\n\"[T]he following terms and conditions of an agreement are indicative of a dummy relationship between the foreign investors and the Filipino stockholders: (i) nominees of the Filipino shareholders may be elected only to positions with ceremonial functions; (ii) giving the foreign investor the right to select the management personnel/staff of the corporation; and (iii) providing that during the term of the agreement, the foreign investor will exercise sole discretion and judgment in arriving at decisions for the best interest of the corporation. According to the DOJ, the effect of these provisions (together with others dealing with the first two indicators) was to allow the foreigner to dominate areas of management, administration and control and operation of the corporation to an extent not proportionate to, and much more than called for by its forty percent (40%) equity.\"335\n\nRelying on certain internal Fraport documents, the Complainants alleged that this criterion was infringed in this case.336\n\nEx RA-176, para. 15. These paragraphs were omitted from the copy originally produced to the Tribunal and exhibited at Ex RA-50. Upon the specific request of the Tribunal, they were produced by the Philippines under cover of their letter of 14 March 2007 as document Nos ROP-T-01641 to ROP-T-OI646, and are exhibited in the Annulment record at Ex RA-176.\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 16.8-17.\n\n215.\n\nThe Complaint was dismissed outright by the Prosecutor in his Resolution. The Prosecutor decided that the Control Test enacted in the Foreign Investment Law (based solely on the percentage of equity investment) was the controlling test for determining nationality, and that this test had not been infringed by Fraport by the structure of its shareholding. He specifically found that the badges of dummy status listed in DOJ Opinion Nos 141 and 165 (including criterion (3)) were no longer applicable:\n\n\"[T]his Office finds, and so holds, that these badges shall not be controlling in the present case, in view of the clear and unequivocal provisions of the Foreign Investment Act of 1991. At the time, no specific rule was established in determining the nationality, hence the need to enumerate \"badges\" in the absence of unequivocal rule on the matter. Considering, however, that the Foreign Investments Act has expressly provided for the Control Test, those badges are inconclusive and inapplicable to the present case.\n\nIn fine, these badges can no longer be used in this case because the Foreign Investment Act already provided that the Control Test shall be used in determining the nationality of the corporation.\"337\n\nProsecutor\u2019s Resolution (27 December 2006), Ex RA-36, pp. 12-13.\n\n216.\n\nThis finding was not set aside by the Prosecutor in his Resolution granting the Motion for Reconsideration.338 On the contrary, the Prosecutor specifically reconfirmed the earlier finding in relation as to the irrelevance of the DOJ Opinions which predated the Foreign Investment Act.339 He held that the Complainants:\n\n\"failed to consider that said DOJ Opinion No. 165 was issued way before the DOJ, the SEC and RA No. 7042 [the Foreign Investment Act] decided to do away with the strict application and computation of the \u2018Grandfather Rule\u2019. The cited indicators or badges of dummy status now find no application vis-a-vis the categorical and clear cut rule laid down by the DOJ, the SEC and RA No. 7042 for determining the citizenship of corporations with foreign equity.\n\nAs intimated by this Honourable Office, the respondents in this case had a right to rely o[n] the provisions of RA No. 7042 and the application of the DOJ and SEC of the control test in determining corporate nationality. \"340\n\nThe Prosecutor based his grant of reconsideration solely on the need to investigate the actual extent of the shareholding.\n\nDOJ Resolution (15 March 2007), Ex RA-39.\n\n*Ibid,* p. 10.\n\n*Ibid,* pp. 10-11.\n\n217.\n\nNevertheless, as detailed in Section C above, the Tribunal held in its Award that the exercise of managerial control was sufficient.341 It dismissed the relevance of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution on the basis that there was no evidence of fact to suggest that the Prosecutor was aware of the secret shareholder agreements.342 It held that the omission of these agreements from the record before the Prosecutor had been dispositive of the dismissal of the criminal complaint.343\n\n*Supra,* para. 167, citing Award paras. 354 & 356.\n\n*Supra,* para. 172, citing Award para. 377.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**e) Conclusions on the Right to Be Heard Before the Arbitral Tribunal**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the parties following receipt of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution did constitute a serious departure from the fundamental rule of procedure entitling the parties to be heard. This was so in respect of the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of both (i) the factual record before the Philippine Prosecutor; and (ii) the implications of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution for the issue of Philippine law before the Arbitral Tribunal as to the construction of Section 2-A of the ADL. It is necessary to explain the Committee\u2019s reasons on each of these points in turn.\n\n***(i) As to the factual record before the Philippine Prosecutor***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe first respect in which the Tribunal failed to accord the parties the right to be heard was as to the factual record of material produced to the Prosecutor. The Tribunal justified its decision not to apply the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution on the ground that there was no evidence to suggest that the Prosecutor had had available to him the Pooling Agreement, which the Tribunal regarded as the critical piece of evidence establishing breach of the ADL. Quite apart from the fact that this evidence would only be relevant to the extent that, as a matter of Philippine law, control exercised in this manner could constitute a breach, the Committee is bound to regard the Tribunal\u2019s approach to the determination of this question of fact as a serious departure from the right to be heard.\n\n220.\n\nThree dates are important regarding Fraport\u2019s denial of an opportunity to address this new material, since they provide for the progressive closure of the proceedings.344 First, on 25 October 2006, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Rules, however reserving the possibility to the Philippines to inform Fraport and the Tribunal of the status of the expropriation proceedings in the Philippines. Paragraph 9 of Procedural Order N\u00b0 24 of 18 July 2006, which ordered the Respondent to update the Tribunal and the Claimant on all developments in the expropriation action, thus remained in effect notwithstanding the closing of the proceedings.345 Second, on 23 April 2007, the Tribunal directed the parties not to send any further letter to the Tribunal. It added: \"This also applies to any further update by the Respondent in respect of the ongoing expropriation proceedings in the Philippines.\"346 Third, the Tribunal finally on 13 June 2007 informed the parties that it \"is of the view that the presentation of their case by both parties is completed and accordingly, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38, the proceeding is now closed in its entirety.\"347\n\n*Supra,* para. 163.\n\nAward, para. 61.\n\n*Supra,* para. 162.\n\nAward, para. 74.\n\n221.\n\nIt was the Philippines that took the initiative to inform the Tribunal on 5 January 2007 about the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution of 27 December 2006, dismissing the ADL Criminal Complaint against PIATCO and Fraport officials, an issue which was otherwise covered by the closing order of 25 October 2006. Fraport immediately replied on 8 January 2007 to stress the Philippines had misrepresented the factual record available to the DOJ in rendering its dismissal and contended that the dismissal was not based on two documents only, i.e., Fraport\u2019s request for ICSID arbitration and the Philippine Senate Blue Ribbon Committee's Report on the Terminal 3 Project, as claimed by the Philippines.\n\n222.\n\nWithout reopening the proceedings, the Tribunal then decided to complete the evidentiary record of material produced to the Prosecutor (i) by asking Fraport on 9 January to submit the documents referred to in its letter of 8 January; (ii) by directing the Philippines to produce the entire evidentiary record before the Philippine Prosecutor on 14 February; and (iii) by inviting Fraport to produce copies of additional documents referred to in its letter of 26 March 2007.\n\n223.\n\nThis further production of documents added over 1900 pages of documents to the file in the arbitration. But it did not result (as the Tribunal had stated in its letter of 14 February was its objective) in any final assurance as to the completeness of the evidentiary record before the Prosecutor. As set out above, the Philippines had originally informed the Tribunal that the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution had been based on only two documents.348 On Fraport informing the Tribunal in its letter of 8 January 2007 that this was not the case, the Philippines produced on 14 March 2007 some 1900 pages of documents from the Prosecutor\u2019s file. When Fraport replied on 26 March 2007 that the record was still incomplete, the response of the Philippines on 30 March 2007 was to produce yet further documents. When doing so it stated the Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s \"recordkeeping can be imperfect\" and that \"Respondent will supplement its production if any additional responsive documents are located.\"349\n\nLetter dated 5 January 2007, Ex CA-34.\n\nEx CA-4E\n\n224.\n\nDespite its indication that it was only seeking to complete the evidentiary record, the Tribunal proceeded to make extensive use in its Award of the documents which had been produced in the Prosecutor\u2019s investigation. This included drawing an inference from a statement given before the Prosecutor as to the credibility of a witness (Dr. Stiller, Fraport\u2019s transaction counsel).350\n\nAward, paras. 373-374.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that the secret shareholder agreements were not in the Prosecutor\u2019s file.351 In so doing, it relied upon the Philippines\u2019 assertion in its letter of 11 January 2007 that \"[t]hese critical documents were unavailable to the DOJ\"352 and on the failure of Fraport to be able to point specifically to disclosure of the relevant document in its letter of 16 March 2007.353 But Fraport had consistently pointed out it did not have a full record of the documents disclosed to the Prosecutor,354 and thus cannot be taken to have conceded this point. Moreover, the Philippines had in effect conceded that the record was incomplete by its letter of March 30, 2007. Nevertheless, the Tribunal made no specific request to either party for submissions as to the adequacy of the disclosure of documents from the Prosecutor\u2019s file. Nor did it give any indication as to the importance which it attached to establishing whether the Prosecutor had had access to the secret shareholder agreements.\n\nAward, para. 38E\n\nAward, para. 368.\n\nAward, para. 381.\n\n*Supra* para. 154.\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal then proceeded to draw the negative inference that the Prosecutor\u2019s decision may well have been different had he been in possession of the Pooling Agreement.355\n\nAward, para. 377.\n\n227.\n\nIn view of the fact that the information as to what documents were in the possession of the Prosecutor had been shown to be unreliable, the Tribunal could not properly, in the Committee\u2019s view, have made such a determination, without hearing both parties on the adequacy and effect of the record before the Prosecutor and considering such further evidentiary enquiries or proceedings as may have been necessary in light of those submissions.\n\n228.\n\nDespite this, the Tribunal had pre-emptively, and before it had even received the additional factual material, directed by letter dated 14 February 2007 that \"the Tribunal does not wish to receive any submissions with respect to this material from either party.\"356\n\nEx CA-38.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal nonetheless continued to investigate the factual record before the Philippine Prosecutor by giving directions to the parties in this respect on 26 March 2007,357 before declaring a total closure of the proceedings on all counts on 13 June 2007. Throughout this period, as stated in its letter of 14 February 2007, the Tribunal \"continue[d] its deliberations.\"358\n\nExRA-60.\n\nExRA-53.\n\n230.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal\u2019s direction of 14 February was incompatible with the fundamental obligation on the Tribunal to permit both parties to present their case in relation to the new material. Given the central importance which the proper construction of the ADL came to play in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis, the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution on the evidence before him had a particular significance. The Tribunal ought not to have proceeded to analyse and consider this evidence itself in its deliberations without having afforded the parties the opportunity to make submissions on it, and availed itself of the benefit of those submissions.\n\n231.\n\nIn such a confused situation, where a factual investigation was conducted on an issue which proved determinative in the outcome of the case, while the deliberative process had already been underway for some months, the Committee considers that the Tribunal ought not to have continued its deliberations. Rather, it ought to have re-opened the proceedings, pursuant to its powers under ICSID Rule 38(2), which provides:\n\n\"Exceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, reopen the proceedings on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points.\"\n\n232.\n\nHowever, and on the contrary, the Tribunal expressly decided on 14 February 2007 that its request \"was not a decision by the Tribunal to reopen the proceeding under ICSID Arbitration Rule 38.\"359 Whilst indicating in the same letter that it would make a determination as to whether it required additional clarification from the parties after considering the requested documents, the Tribunal in fact never made such a determination, or, if it did, it did not communicate it to the parties. Rather, it merely peremptorily foreclosed further communications from the parties, without indicating the issues to which it considered the new material might relate.\n\nEx CA-38.\n\n233.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Tribunal had both closed the proceedings and had expressly stated that it would not receive submissions from either party on the new material, the Committee does not consider that Fraport has forfeited its right to object in these annulment proceedings to the Tribunal\u2019s failure to observe this fundamental rule of procedure. Fraport could only have forfeited its right to complain in the annulment proceeding on the ground of Article 52(1)(d) if it had known the significance that the Tribunal would draw out of this investigation in the factual record of the Prosecutor in the deliberations phase, which obviously it could not do before reading the award.\n\n234.\n\nA party can only waive an objection if it is reasonably aware of the decision of the tribunal to which it may wish to object. In the present case, the Tribunal had stated that it \"merely seeks to complete the evidentiary record.\"360 It gave no indication of the use to which it may put the new material. Moreover, it stated that it would \"determine whether it requires additional clarification from the Parties\"361 after it had considered the new material, but that, in the meantime, the proceedings were not reopened under Rule 38 as they should have in order to provide the parties an opportunity to explain themselves in an adversarial manner on the factual record of the Prosecutor. The Tribunal never communicated its determination on the question whether it required additional clarification from the parties. Accordingly, there was no determination to which the parties could either have acquiesced or objected. On the contrary, the Tribunal repeatedly instructed the parties not to make submissions to it. In the circumstances, Fraport cannot be criticised for having failed to make its objection known. It was prevented from taking that very course.\n\nLetter from Tribunal dated 14 February 2007, Ex CA-38.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n***(ii) As to the implications of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution on Section 2-A of the ADL***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nFailure to reopen the proceedings following receipt of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution and documents from his file also had consequences with regard to the conclusions in the Award on the Respondent\u2019s objection to the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Tribunal based on an alleged violation of the ADL. This was the issue which came to form the *ratio* of the Tribunal\u2019s Award. In the Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal\u2019s failure to permit the parties to make fresh submissions to it in the light of important new material casting doubt on the whole basis on which the Tribunal was proceeding underscores the serious nature of the departure from the right to be heard.\n\n236.\n\nIn light of the express requirements of the BIT, the Tribunal decided that Philippine law, as the \"laws and regulations of [a] Contracting State\" had to be applied as part of its enquiry into whether it had jurisdiction *ratione materiae362* Both international law and Philippine law are thus relevant to this enquiry.363 So far as Philippine law was concerned, the Tribunal identified ADL as the specific law in question. To the extent of its applicability, the Tribunal (whilst retaining its independent powers of assessment of the evidence and decision) should give particular consideration to municipal decisions as to the construction of the ADL in determining how it would be applied within the municipal legal system.364 This was particularly important in the present case as it is recognised that the Tribunal had not been chosen for its knowledge of Philippine law. It follows that the right of the parties to be heard importantly includes an opportunity to be heard on the meaning and effect of any such relevant municipal decisions.365\n\nAward, paras. 335-343.\n\n*See* *MTD Equity Sdn Bhd (MTD) v.

Rep. pp. 850, 881-2.\n\n237.\n\nThis issue as to violation of Section 2-A of the ADL was, as the Tribunal itself accepted, \"essentially argued in post-hearing submissions because most of the documents that established it were produced either immediately before the hearing on jurisdiction and liability or, at the President\u2019s insistence, during the hearing itself.\"366 The consequence of this was that the matter was not considered in any detail in the expert reports as to Philippine Law filed in the proceedings.367\n\nAward, para. 383.\n\nThe Legal Opinion of Professor Mendoza dated 18 December 2004 (Ex RA-79) and filed on behalf of the Philippines with its Counter-Memorial contains references to the ADL in three paragraphs (129-131), which cite DOJ Opinion No 165 without elaboration.\n\n238.\n\nNor was further authority as to the issue of construction which had arisen on the application of Section 2-A cited by the parties in their post-hearing briefs.368\n\nExRA-72-RA-76.\n\n239.\n\nIn the result, therefore, as was accepted by the Philippines during the oral hearing of these annulment proceedings,369 the evidence as to the construction of Section 2-A as a matter of Philippine law, other than contemporaneous factual documents, available to the Tribunal to assist it in its determination of the dispositive issue was limited to:\n\n(a) The text of the ADL itself;\n\n(b) Reference to two Department of Justice Opinions (Nos 141 and 165), the texts of which (as was accepted by the Philippines before the Committee) were not produced to the Tribunal;370 and\n\n(c) The decision of the Supreme Court in *Luzon v. Anti-Dummy Board,371* which is concerned with the express provisions of the ADL relating to the employment of aliens and does not decide the point at issue in the instant case.372\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 787/ 15-788/ 3.\n\nWhite & Case letter 14 September 2009. The document described as DOJ Opinion No 165 s. 1984 exhibited at RA-217 (Mendoza Ex 82) is not a copy of the Opinion of 1984, but rather a note purporting to apply the badges of dummy-ship in the Opinion to the facts of the *Fraport* case.\n\n(18 August 1972)ExRA-13.\n\nAfter the hearing, and in response to the Committee\u2019s enquiry in relation to the record before the Tribunal concerning the evidence of Philippine law, the Philippines supplied the Committee with a complete list of the legal authorities pertaining to Philippine nationality laws and the ADL in the record of the underlying arbitration: Letter dated 14 September 2009, *supra* n. 231. The Committee has considered all of those to the extent that they are either recited in the Award or exhibited in the Annulment Proceeding. None of them add materially to the specific issue relating to the effect of managerial control under Section 2-A of the ADL.\n\n240.\n\nIn arriving at its construction of the ADL in Section D of the Award, apart from its reference to the contemporaneous factual record, the Tribunal only cites the text of the ADL itself373 and to DOJ Opinion No 165.374\n\nAward, para. 349.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 352.\n\n241.\n\nAgainst this background, the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution, and the subsequent Resolution on Reconsideration of 15 March 2007, which were submitted by the Philippines on 5 January and 19 March 2007, after the closure of the proceedings by the Tribunal on 25 October 2006, provide for the first time specific evidence of Philippine law on the relevant issue. Both resolutions state in express terms, in response to a specific complaint that Fraport\u2019s exercise of management control over PIATCO constituted a breach of the ADL, that this test was no longer applicable to determine breach.\n\n242.\n\nThis is not to say that the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution was necessarily dispositive of the point for the purpose of the Tribunal\u2019s determination of its jurisdiction. On the contrary, the decisions of municipal authorities seized of cases against an alien which arise directly out of the same set of facts may need to be scrutinised very carefully by an international tribunal. The tribunal would need to satisfy itself, *inter alia,* as to the impartiality of the relevant decision-maker, in view of the pendency of proceedings against the state of which that decision-maker is an organ. The tribunal retains the ultimate power to judge the probative value of evidence placed before it.\n\n243.\n\nHowever, in the context of the manner in which the issue arose in the instant case, the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution was of singular significance. In the first place, one of the issues raised by the complainants was the very issue of construction of the law which troubled the Tribunal. Secondly, the Prosecutor was the very official charged with responsibility for administration of the ADL. Thirdly, his decision, being adverse to the interests of the state, appeared to have been reached independently. Fourthly, the decision specifically rejected the applicability of the one legal authority which had been cited as pertaining to the issue of managerial control (DOJ Opinion No 165). Fifthly, the Prosecutor decided that a test of managerial control was not applicable to determine Fraport\u2019s liability under the ADL.\n\n244.\n\nThe consequence is that Fraport should, as it has submitted before this Committee, have been accorded an opportunity to make submissions before the Tribunal, as to the legal effect of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution, including that:\n\n(a) The Philippines was estopped from contending for a construction of the ADL contrary to that adopted by its responsible official; or alternatively,\n\n(b) the Tribunal should have given effect to the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution on the point, bearing in mind the obligation upon the Tribunal to apply municipal law as it would be applied in the Philippines, taking into account the evidence of the relevant authorities as to the proper construction of that law.375\n\n*Serbian Loans Case, supra* n. 365, p. 46; *Brazilian Loans Case, supra* n. 365, p. 124.\n\n245.\n\nThe consequence is that, at least to the extent that the Tribunal determined to base the *ratio* of its decision on its construction of Section 2-A of the ADL, and to depart from the decision on its construction taken by the Prosecutor, it ought to have provided a further opportunity to the parties to submit evidence on Philippine law and to make submissions thereon relative to this specific question. Its failure to do so underscores the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n246.\n\nThe departure was one which materially prejudiced Fraport, in view of the Tribunal\u2019s adverse findings both as to the question of fact relating to the record before the Prosecutor and as to the relevance of the Prosecutor\u2019s Resolution for the question of law concerning the construction of the ADL (irrespective of what the proper construction of that law might finally be). Each of these related specifically to evidence which had been tendered to the Tribunal after its closure of the proceedings. Each was an essential step in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, leading to the decision in its Award to accept the Philippines\u2019 objection to ICSID jurisdiction and to dismiss Fraport\u2019s claim.376\n\n*Supra* para. 30; Award *dispositif,* para. 406.\n\n247.\n\nAccordingly, for all of the reasons set out in Part IV B of this Decision, the Award must be annulled in its entirety.\n\n**C. Failure to State the Reasons**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**a) Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n248.\n\nThe third ground for annulment of the Award raised by Fraport is \"that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based\": Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. The *ad hoc* Committee in *CDC v. Seychelles* observed:\n\n\"Annulment under Article 52(1)(e) is permissible where a tribunal fails to state the reasons on which its award is based. This ground for annulment has been a cause of great concern to commentators since, unlike (b) and (d), it does not include any limiting terms such as \u2018manifest\u2019, \u2018serious\u2019 or \u2018fundamental\u2019. Early on, *ad hoc* Committees interpreted this clause in such a way that it appeared to allow inquiry into the sufficiency or substance of the reasons offered.\"377\n\n*CDC* v. *Seychelles,* Decision on Annulment, 29 June 2005, 11 ICSID Reports, p. 259, para. 66.\n\n249.\n\nThe ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) relates to the requirement expressed in Article 48(3) of the Washington Convention that \"[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\" The rationale for a reasoned award as required by Article 48(3) of the Washington Convention is that the parties will want to assure themselves that the Tribunal properly understood the questions before it as stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE:*\n\n\"The Committee is of the opinion that the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. [...] In the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\"378\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v. Guinea,* Decision on Annulment, 22 December 1989, ICSID Reports, p. 88, paras. 5.08-5.09.\n\n250.\n\nReasons are important to the legitimacy of the decision. The obligation to give a reasoned award is a guarantee that the Tribunal has not decided in an arbitrary manner. The parties will want to assure themselves as to how the Tribunal reached its conclusions and whether such conclusions can be challenged before an *ad hoc* committee. Such a challenge, nevertheless, can only take place in the very limited setting of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention of reviewing the legality of the award without retrial of the factual and legal issues dealt with by the tribunal.\n\n**b) Parties\u2019 Submissions**\n---------------------------\n\n251.\n\nFirst, Fraport contends that the Tribunal failed to give reasons for its finding that it violated the ADL.379 It submits that there are no reasons with regard to its alleged breach as principal or accessory. The fact that the parties are unclear about the meaning of the reasons set forth in paragraph 356 of the Award, according to which \"[t]he Tribunal construes this part of the ADL as covering intervention by shareholders, if that is the actual means of intervening in \u2018the management, operation, administration or control\u2019 of PIATCO,\" shows that the Award fails to give an understandable decision.380 There cannot be violation by an accessory in the absence of a violation by a principal and there was no finding of a violation by PIATCO as a principal.381 The Tribunal would have to find with regard to the criminal act of the principal that a company holding a reserved interest such as a public utility concession permitted or allowed a non-Philippine party to intervene in the management, operation, administration or control of the company holding the reserved interest, and that the manner of intervention, which the company holding the interest permitted, was \"as an officer, employee or laborer therein with or without remuneration except technical personnel whose employment may be specifically authorized by the Secretary of Justice.\" With regard to accessory, the Tribunal would have to find that a person (not a corporation) carried out an act objectively aiding, assisting or abetting the act of the principal and did so knowingly, i.e., in full knowledge of the acts of the principal and that its own action was aiding, assisting or abetting.382 Fraport contends that the Award is devoid of any factual finding of the existence of a constitutionally defined category of public utility with respect to which the ADL could be applicable, and asserts that the Tribunal did not state reasons as to how a public utility can be said to exist because the date of nullification of the Terminal Concession was prior to the Terminal becoming operational.383 Fraport criticizes the Award further for providing no reason as to why the QT Report and letters should have given Fraport knowledge that the Pooling Agreement could result in intervention in PIATCO management in violation of Philippine law nor as to why, having received advice that the employment of aliens by PIATCO was restricted by the terms of the ADL, Fraport knew or should have known that participation as a shareholder in a preliminary meeting could violate the ADL. According to Fraport, the Award also fails to state reasons with regard to the *mens rea.384*\n\nMemorial, paras. 191-193, Transcript, Day 3, 632.\n\nReply, paras. 168-171.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 171, 174, Transcript, Day 1, 155.\n\nMemorial, para. 102, Reply, para. 171.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 142-148.\n\n*Ibid.,* 179-184.\n\n252.\n\nSecond, Fraport says that the Award does not give reasons for its conclusion that it violated the ADL. Fraport cites paragraph 395 as a \"prime example\" of reasons that do not enable one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from point A to point B and eventually to its conclusion.385 The Applicant says that paragraph 395 contradicts the majority\u2019s hypothesis of a reference to Philippine law in Article 1 of the BIT and is even in itself contradictory. The majority of the Tribunal argues that, despite a reference to Philippine law, the commission of the *actus reus* in Section 2-A of the ADL, consisting in \"permitting or allowing\" a third party to intervene in the \"management, operation or control\" of a public utility concession falling within Section 2-A, is unnecessary for finding a breach of Philippine law as \"the relevance of compliance with national law for jurisdiction *ratione materiae* purposes is at the moment of the investment\",386 i.e., before any *actus reus* can be performed. The majority of the Tribunal also cites the part of Section 2-A of the ADL which allows for the act of assistance to be performed during the planning phase. Fraport alleges that the reader cannot determine whether what the majority had in mind was something describing an attempt to commit a breach of Section 2-A by a principal or attempted aiding and abetting. There is no guidance in the Award which of the two alternatives was on the majority\u2019s mind, as the majority\u2019s reasoning fails to explain whether Fraport qualifies as principal or accessory.387\n\nReply, para. 180; Transcript, Day 1, 34, Day 3, 591-592.\n\nAward, para. 395.\n\nReply, para. 180.\n\n253.\n\nThird, Fraport alleges that the Award next fails to give reasons for the failure to apply the principle of *nullum crimen sine lege.* The application of the ADL in paragraphs 356 and 395 of the Award violated this principle. The Applicant argues that, because there is no trace that the *nullum crimen* principle was considered by the Tribunal, the Award has an important lacuna which makes it impossible for the reader to follow the reasoning on this point.388 The Applicant also contends that the Award fails to give reasons enabling the Committee to assess the fairness of the weighing of evidence. It says that the majority did not approach the evidence with an open mind admitting the possibility of doubt. Instead, the Tribunal in paragraph 399 of the Award speaks of \"a case in which *res ipsa loquitur\".* The reasons dealing with the applicable standard of evidence given by the majority and the conclusions are contradictory and do not enable the *ad hoc* Committee to verify that the Tribunal acted in accordance with the principles of fair trial and *in dubio pro reo.389*\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 72-87, 183-184, Transcript, Day 1, 265-268.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 186, 189, 190, Transcript, Day 1, 248-249,265-270, Day 3, 680.\n\n254.\n\nFourth, Fraport contends that the Award fails to give reasons for its failure to apply the BIT separately to each of Fraport\u2019s discrete investments.390 There are no reasons provided in the Award for treating all of Fraport\u2019s various equity and debt investments -all of which the majority found to be legal - as a single illegal investment; for treating the entire investment as unlawful on account of the Pooling Agreement and the Addendum to the PIATCO Shareholders Agreement, which were entirely severable and independent of Fraport\u2019s investments; and finally for dismissing Fraport\u2019s investments made during 2001 after the allegedly offending provisions of the Pooling Agreement and Addendum had been amended, even though the Respondent itself accepted that following the amendments Fraport\u2019s shareholding structure was fully in accordance with Philippine law.391 The Award does not address the question of Fraport\u2019s debt investment in the project although these non-equity investments amounted to more than US$340 million or 80% of the overall value of Fraport\u2019s investment in the Philippines and were not governed by any of the Shareholder Agreements. Similarly, the Award does not address clearly identified equity investments with a monetary value of more than US$25 million which were made after the allegedly offending provisions of the Shareholder Agreements had been amended.392\n\nMemorial, para. 194.\n\nMemorial, para. 194, Reply, para. 191, Transcript, Day 1, 183-184.\n\nReply, paras. 193,194.\n\n255.\n\nThe Republic of the Philippines replies that the Award is supported by both explicit and implicit reasons sufficient to satisfy Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.393 The Philippines recalls that neither disagreement with the reasoning of an award nor the persuasiveness of the reasons provide grounds for annulment.394 According to the Respondent, it is possible to follow the reasons that led the Tribunal to the conclusions that Fraport\u2019s investment as a whole fell outside the protections of the BIT.395 Fraport\u2019s contention that the Tribunal failed to state reasons of its conclusion that its investment ran afoul of the ADL is without merit, as each of its arguments stems from its substantial disagreement with the Tribunal's conclusions.396 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal made all the key findings necessary to conclude that Fraport violated the aiding or abetting provision of the ADL.397\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 258.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 259, 262-265; Rejoinder, paras. 184-193; Transcript, Day 2, 333-337, 564-567.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 268, 269.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 194, 195.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 196, 199.\n\n256.\n\nAccording to the Philippines, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that there was a principal violator is plainly evident from the face of the Award and is in any event implicit in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.398 The ADL indicates that the principal violator is the Philippine citizen holding the public utility concession that permits or allows a foreign entity to intervene and control and the aider or abettor is the entity which intervenes to exercise that control.399 The Tribunal identified the *actus reus* as Fraport\u2019s knowing and intentional circumvention of the ADL by means of secret shareholder agreements which provided unlawful control over PIATCO. It was by planning and then entering into the Secret Shareholder Agreements that Fraport was permitted or allowed to exercise control over PIATCO, thereby committing the necessary *actus reus* as an aider or abettor. The Tribunal referred to Fraport\u2019s intent because the ADL requires an aider or abettor to knowingly act. Since this violation of Philippine law knowingly occurred at the outset of its investment, that investment did not qualify for protection under the BIT.400 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the nullity of the Concession Contract does not mean that retroactively there is no possible relevance to the constitutional limitations and ADL. The Terminal is the public service.401\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 202.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 199.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 204, 205; Transcript, Day 2, 406, Day 3, 769-772.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 407-409.\n\n257.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons for not citing the principle of *nullum crimen sine lege* because this principle is not applicable to an international tribunal\u2019s determination of its jurisdiction in an investment dispute and was not invoked by Fraport in the arbitration.402 Article 52(1)(e) has no role in ensuring that tribunals comply with fundamental rules of procedure. In any event, the Tribunal devoted a substantial portion of its award to consideration of the Secret Shareholder Agreements and Fraport had a full opportunity to comment in written and oral submissions.403 The Republic of the Philippines declares that the Tribunal did not fail to consider Fraport\u2019s entire investment in NAIA Terminal 3 Project but concluded that it was not entitled to protection because it was not accepted in accordance with Philippine law. Fraport\u2019s decision to continue to pour money into its ill-conceived and unlawfully structured investment obviously did not provide a basis for the Tribunal to consider those late additions to be lawful stand-alone investments.404 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal considered the composite of the investments which were characterized by Fraport as a unitary investment.405 The Award is amply supported, the Republic of the Philippines argues, by explicit and implicit reasoning sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Washington Convention.406\n\nRejoinder, paras. 207-210, Transcript, Day 3, 778.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 211-212.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 216.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 338.\n\nRejoinder, para. 183.\n\n**c) The Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nAs early as in the *Kl\u00f4ckner I* annulment decision in 1985, it was made clear that \"the Committee can only take the award as it is.\"407 The disputed subject matter is not submitted once again for adjudication to an *ad hoc* committee. It is only the award as made by the Tribunal which is scrutinized under the limited number of grounds of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. The above mentioned declaration of the *Kl\u00f4ckner I* Committee has the following implications in the context of Article 52(1)(e).\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner I v. Cameroon,* Decision on Annulment, 3 May 1985, 2 ICSID Reports, p. 95, para. 73.\n\n***(i) The Award as actually decided by the Tribunal is controlled under Article 52(1)(e)***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nA first implication of the holding in *Kl\u00f4ckner I* is that an *ad hoc* committee controls the award for what has been actually decided by the Tribunal and not for what the applicant would have wished the award to be. This point has particular implication for Fraport\u2019s first, third and fourth objections under this ground.\n\n1) *Discrete investments*\n-------------------------\n\n260.\n\nFraport explains that its equity investment did not take place at one time. After its initial investment in PIATCO in 1999, Fraport stresses that it increased its shareholding in PIATCO and in cascade companies (PTI, PTH,....) in 2000 and 2001 and that it also made non-equity investments in the form of loans and guarantees during 2000 and 2001 which accounted for the largest part of its investments by exceeding 80% of its overall claim of US$425 million.408\n\nMemorial, paras. 76, 79, 80, 81.\n\n261.\n\nThe Award describes Fraport\u2019s investment in the Terminal 3 Project as one \"made in a Philippine company, Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc., later known as PIATCO. Fraport\u2019s investment in PIATCO, both as a shareholder and lender, was influenced by the fact that the Respondent had, prior to the investment at issue, conferred upon PIATCO the concession rights for the construction and operation of a new international passenger airport terminal in Manila, otherwise known as Ninoy Aquino International Airport Passenger Terminal III or Terminal 3.409 At paragraph 116 which is cited by Fraport,410 the Award reports that \"Fraport\u2019s Investment as a financial participant in the Terminal 3 project spans a period of several years, starting in 1999 and ending in 2002-2003, when, as the evidence discloses, Fraport progressively wrote off its investment. Fraport\u2019s investment was both directly in PIATCO and, indirectly, in a cascade of Philippine companies that have ownership interests in PIATCO. In addition to its equity investments, Fraport has extended loans and loan payment guarantees to PIATCO, the cascade companies and PIATCO\u2019s lenders and contractors\".\n\nAward, para. 2.\n\nMemorial, footnote 108.\n\n262.\n\nThe Applicant has in the annulment proceeding atomized its investment as a financial participant in the Terminal 3 Project into several investments which, it claims, should have been considered individually by the Tribunal for admission under Article 1 of the BIT. However, at the time of the arbitration, the Republic of the Philippines rightly observes, Fraport characterized its investment exceeding US$425 million which funded the design and construction of a state-of-the-art international passenger terminal at Manila\u2019s airport as one global investment in share acquisition in PIATCO and in the cascade companies in PIATCO in addition to the loans and loan and payment guarantees.411 Reasons are obligatory under Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention to the extent a question was put to the Tribunal. However, Fraport here is attempting to open before the Committee a question which has not been presented to the Tribunal. The Award cannot be criticized for neglecting a question which was not addressed to the Tribunal and for not giving reasons thereof.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Arbitration Memorial, paras. 34-41.\n\n2) *Public utility*\n-------------------\n\n263.\n\nIn its discussion regarding the interpretation of the ADL, the Tribunal states that \"[e]ach interpretation must be made in the light of the Constitution and the ensemble of legislation of which a particular statute is a part.\"412 At paragraph 309, the Award also underlines in the QT Report of 11 January 1999 the provisions of the Constitution of the Philippines which require that the participation of foreign investors in the governing body of a public utility enterprise shall be limited to their proportionate share in its capital, and that all the executive and managing officers of such corporation or association be citizens of the Philippines. The Award notes that the QT Report of 11 January 1999 states that, although the term public utility is not defined with exactitude in Philippine law and is subject to broad interpretation, \"[g]enerally, the operations of the Project fall within the meaning of a public utility.\"413\n\nAward, para 349.\n\nAward, para. 309.\n\n264.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena* declared that\n\n\"[n]either Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specify the manner in which the Tribunal\u2019s reasons are to be stated. The object of both provisions is to ensure that the Parties will be able to understand the Tribunal's reasoning. This goal does not require that each reason be stated expressly. The tribunal\u2019s reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision.\"414\n\nIt is also accepted that an *ad hoc* committee may clarify the reasons of the decision when they are implicit.\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2002, 6 ICSID Reports, p. 146, para. 81.\n\n265.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Soufraki* explained that\n\n\"if the Committee can make clear - without adding new elements previously absent - that apparent obscurities are, in fact, not real, that inadequate statements have no consequence on the solution, or that succinct reasoning does not actually overlook pertinent facts, the committee should not annul the initial award. For example, as regards the ground that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based, if the *ad hoc* Committee can \u2018explain\u2019 the Award by clarifying reasons that seemed absent because they were only implicit, it should do so.\"415\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE,* Decision on Annulment, 5 June 2007, para. 24.\n\n266.\n\nIn the case at hand, when the Award, at paragraph 350, declares that Fraport did not exceed the statutorily determined level of equity investment lawfully permitted to a foreign investor or loaned too much to a constitutionally defined category of public utility, there is no indication that it refers to anything else than the Terminal 3 Project. The Applicant offers no other reasonable explanation.\n\n3) *Principal/accessory*\n------------------------\n\n267.\n\nThe Award declares that there are two alternative ways of establishing an ADL violation under Philippine law, a quantitative test or an actual demonstration of managerial control. In the latter case, the quantum of equity in the company is irrelevant.416 The Tribunal stresses that its concern is not with Fraport\u2019s quantitative equity but with the shareholder agreements417 and then holds:\n\n\"[i]t is correct that Fraport\u2019s real modality of intervention in \u2018the management, operation, administration or control\u2019 of PIATCO for the items specified in the FAG-PAIRCARGO-PAGS-PTI Shareholders\u2019 Agreement is as a shareholder in the confidential but binding preliminary meeting described at Article 2.02 thereof. Fraport does not, as the ADL specifies, intervene, as an officer, employee or laborer in the subsequent formal board meeting that rubber-stamps the result of the confidential but binding meeting. To be sure, the formal validity of unlawful intervention would still be accomplished by Fraport\u2019s designated officer in PIATCO; indeed the real control decision would always have to be implemented, wherever it may have been made, by \u2018an officer, employee or laborer\u2019 within PIATCO; that would satisfy a literal interpretation. But a literal interpretation here could produce an absurdity: an alien would violate the ADL if its designated officer intervened to manage and control matters A, B and C, but the same would not violate the ADL if it secretly intervened as a shareholder to manage and control those same matters. The Tribunal construes this part of the ADL as covering intervention by shareholders, if that is the actual means of intervention in the management, operation, administration or control of PIATCO. Nor does this interpretation impose a retroactive burden on Fraport, for its own documents, which the Tribunal reviewed above, indicate that Fraport was well aware that the arrangements it was making were not in accordance with the ADL.\"418\n\nAward, para. 354.\n\nAward, paras. 323,355.\n\nAward, para. 356.\n\n268.\n\nAccording to the *Kl\u00f4ckner I* decision:\n\n\"[t]he text of [Article 52(1)(e)] requires a statement of reasons on which the award is based. This does not mean just any reasons, purely formal or apparent, but rather reasons having some substance, allowing the reader to follow the arbitral tribunal's reasoning, on facts and on law. [...] [T]here would be a \u2018failure to state reasons\u2019 in the absence of a statement of reasons that are \u2018sufficiently relevant\u2019, that is, reasonably sustainable and capable of providing a basis for the decision.\"419\n\nThe above passage of the Award makes clear that, according to the Tribunal, Fraport did not intervene \"as an officer, employee or laborer\" as mentioned in Section 2-A of the ADL, but notwithstanding, it would still violate the ADL if it secretly intervened as shareholder to manage and control PIATCO. The Applicant nonetheless claims that there is a failure to state reasons for the violation of the ADL as a principal or accessory which is material to the solution. Fraport is correct in contending that a finding of its criminal liability or that of its officers or employees would have required a declaration as to whether the accused was a principal or an accessory. The construction of a criminal statute such as the ADL by an ICSID tribunal, however, does not turn the arbitration proceeding into a criminal proceeding. The question before the Tribunal was not that of the criminal liability of Fraport or of its officers or employees, but that of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under the Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of the Philippines for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of 18 April 1997.\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner I v. Cameroon,* Decision on Annulment, 3 May 1985, 2 ICSID Reports, p. 95, paras. 119-120.\n\n269.\n\nThe Award stresses that \"whatever standard of proof is required under Philippine law to prove a criminal act, the jurisdictional question before this Tribunal, which is seized of an international investment dispute, is not a determination of a crime, but whether an economic transaction by a German company was made \u2018in accordance\u2019 with Philippine law and thus qualifies as an \u2018investment\u2019 under the German-Philippine BIT \"420 Determining the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, in view of the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent, required the Tribunal to interpret Article 1 of the BIT which reads: \"the term \u2018investment\u2019 shall mean any kind of asset accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State.\"421 The Tribunal considered the ADL in the course of its examination of whether Fraport\u2019s investment was protected by the BIT,422 not in the context of criminal charges against Fraport or its officers or employees. The Tribunal resolved the question of its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* with a negative answer, holding that \"Fraport knowingly and intentionally circumvented the ADL by means of secret shareholder agreements. As a consequence, it cannot claim to have made an investment \u2018in accordance with law\u2019 [....] Because there is no \u2018investment in accordance with law\u2019, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae*,\"423 In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal did not have to give reasons for the criminal liability as principal or accessory of Fraport, its officers or employees, or to the existence of a guilty mind on their part, a question of interest to a criminal court, but which was not within the remit of the Tribunal. Fraport fails to prove a defect of the Award under Article 52(1)(e).\n\nAward, para. 399.\n\nAward, paras. 334-348.\n\nAward, para. 396.\n\nAward, para. 401.\n\n4) *Nullum crimen sine lege/ in dubio pro reo*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nIn the context of criminal proceedings, *nullum crimen sine lege* is a substantive principle for the protection of the accused which holds that criminal law may not be extensively construed, for instance by analogy.424 It is common ground that Fraport, its officers or employees were never charged before the Tribunal for violation of the ADL and did not have to defend against an accusation of penal nature in the ICSID arbitration proceeding. It bears reiterating that the question submitted to the Tribunal was solely that of the legality of Fraport\u2019s investment for jurisdictional purposes under the German-Philippines BIT of 18 April 1997. As a consequence, the Tribunal cannot be criticized for not providing in its Award reasons why it did not apply a substantive principle of criminal law. This did not come within its mission. The Committee further observes that Fraport did not invoke said principle in the arbitration proceeding. Failure to deal with questions submitted to the Tribunal may amount to a failure to state reasons where this results in a failure in the intelligibility of the reasoning in the Award itself,425 but this is a different situation from the present case. Fraport\u2019s criticism of the Award for giving no reasons to arguments which the Applicant introduces for the first time in the annulment proceeding is groundless. Accordingly, there is no lacuna in the Award.\n\n*See* ECHR 25 May 1993, *Kokkikanis v. Greece,* No 14307/88; 12 February 2008, *Kafkaris v. Cyprus,* No 21906/04.\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v. Guinea,* Decision on Annulment, 22 December 1989, 4 ICSID Reports, p. 89, para. 5.l3andpp. 107-108, paras. 6.98-6,108.\n\n271.\n\nCommenting on the evidentiary standards, the Tribunal emphasized that the issue before it was not whether a crime under Philippine law was committed, but whether an economic transaction by Fraport was made \"in accordance\" with Philippine law and thus qualifies as an \"investment\" under the German-Philippine BIT. Then the Tribunal observed: \"[e]ven assuming, however, that the \u2018preponderance of evidence\u2019 test which applies in civil law must yield in the instant case to a \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 test because the subject of the \u2018in accordance\u2019 inquiry is a Philippine criminal statute, this is a case in which *res ipsa loquitur.* The relevant facts, all of which are found in Fraport\u2019s own documents, are incontrovertible.\"426 The Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding the failure of the Tribunal to abide by the presumption of *in dubio pro reo* cannot be considered in the context of Article 52(1)(e). There are instances where the absence of reasons may impact upon other issues, for example, if the motivation of an award is so aberrant that it would violate a fundamental rule of procedure.427 Such grievance must then be examined under Article 52(1)(b) or Article 52(1)(d) and not under Article 52(1)(e). Accordingly, the Committee decides that the essential interest protected by the *in dubio* principle is the right to be heard and answers Fraport\u2019s arguments in the context of the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nAward, para. 399.\n\n*See* the *Amco I* decision at para 32 on the relationship between Article 52(1)(e) and (d) and (b). *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia (\u2018Amco I\"),* Decision on Annulment, 16 May 1986, 1 ICSID Reports, p. 517, para. 32.\n\n***(ii) The scrutiny of the Award by the*** **ad hoc** ***Committee under Article 52(1)(e) cannot cause a reopening of the case***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe holding in the *Kl\u00f4ckner I* decision, according to which \"the Committee can only take the award as it is\", also implies that the annulment proceeding cannot cause an entire reopening of the case. Referring to the decisions of the *ad hoc* Committees in *MINE, Vivendi* and *Wena,* the *ad hoc* Committee in *CDC v. Seychelles* observed that \"[i]t thus appears that the more recent practice among *ad hoc* Committees is to apply Article 52(1)(e) in such a manner that the Committee does not intrude into the legal and factual decision-making of the Tribunal.\"428 This point has particular significance for Fraport\u2019s second objection under this ground, the failure to give reasons as to whether an attempt constitutes an offence under the ADL. Insufficient, inadequate or contradictory reasons have been assimilated by *ad hoc* committees to a failure to state reasons as established by *Kl\u00f4ckner.429* and *Soufraki v. UAE430* decisions. They must be distinguished from reasons which are claimed to be legally or factually wrong, the latter escaping from review by an *ad hoc* committee.\n\n*CDC* v. *Seychelles,* Decision on Annulment, 29 June 2005, 11 ICSID Reports, p. 260, para. 70.\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner I v. Cameroon,* Decision on Annulment, 3 May 1985, 2 ICSID Reports, p. 136, paras. 114-120.\n\n*Hussein Nuaman* *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates (\"Soufraki \u2019\u2019),* Decision on Annulment, 5 June 2007, para. 126.\n\n273.\n\nIn the present case, the parties discussed the violation of the ADL by Fraport at some length in their post-hearing submissions, including whether an attempt constitutes an offense.431 Fraport denounces what it alleges are two main contradictions in the reasoning of the Tribunal. First, Fraport argues that the Tribunal dispenses with the requirement of *actus reus* defined in Section 2-A of the ADL but nonetheless decides that a breach of Philippine law has been committed. Next, Fraport claims that the Tribunal invented a crime of attempt in Section 2-A and held that Fraport committed such crime without finding an act of assistance or abetment or without the identification of a principal.\n\nClaimant\u2019s post-hearing Submission, paras. 13-17; Respondent\u2019s post-hearing Submission, paras. 3-38; Respondent\u2019s supplemental post-hearing submission, paras. 135-161; Claimant\u2019s Observations regarding Respondent\u2019s second post-hearing submission, paras. 109-118; Respondent\u2019s supplemental post-hearing Reply, paras. 94-117.\n\n274.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Kl\u00f4ckner I* stated the following on contradictory reasons in an arbitral award:\n\n\"As for \u2018contradiction of reasons\u2019, it is in principle appropriate to bring this notion under the category \u2018failure to state reasons\u2019 for the very simple reason that two *genuinely* contradictory reasons cancel each other out. Hence the failure to state reasons. The arbitrator\u2019s obligation to state reasons which are not contradictory must therefore be accepted.\"432\n\nThis view has been accepted by other *ad hoc* committees, such as in *MTD v. Chile,* where the *ad hoc* Committee confirmed that \"outright or unexplained contradictions can involve a failure to state reasons.\"433 The Applicant\u2019s criticisms must also be examined bearing in mind the declaration of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi v. Argentina* that \"tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.\"434\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner I v. Cameroon,* Decision on Annulment, 3 May 1985, 2 ICSID Reports, p. 137, para. 116 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. (MTD) v. Chile,* Decision on Annulment, 21 March 2007, 13 ICSID Reports, p. 516, para. 78.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, *(\"Vivendi I),* 6 ICSID Reports, p. 358, para. 65.\n\n275.\n\nHaving declared that \"the acquisition of shares by a foreign investor in a domestic corporation is a legal transaction that does not, by its nature, require some action by the government involving acceptance or permission, yet it is quite clear from the BIT and the Protocol that accordance with the host state's law is nonetheless required,\"435 the Tribunal could without any contradiction hold that \"the relevance of compliance with national law for jurisdiction *ratione materiae* purposes is at the moment of the investment, as explained in the analysis of the BIT\u2019s terms. That is a limitation which actually works in favour of both the foreign investor and international jurisdiction.\"436 The Tribunal principally relied on the fact that, in its final report of 26 February 1999 to its Supervisory Board, Fraport disregarded the requirements of Philippine law which had been expressed by QT in its due diligence report on legal issues, in particular with respect to the ADL.437 According to the Tribunal, Fraport\u2019s Supervisory Board was fully aware of the inconsistency of the proposed arrangements with Philippine law, but decided to proceed with the project.438 The Tribunal held that Fraport implemented its strategy by means of secret shareholding agreements that circumvented Philippine law.439 The Tribunal explained that Fraport structured its investment in a way that \"consciously, intentionally and covertly\" violated the ADL440 and held: \"[i]n summary, Fraport had been fully advised and was fully aware of the ADL and the incompatibility with the ADL of the structure of its investment which it planned and ultimately put into place with the secret shareholder agreements.\"441 In light of the view which the Tribunal took as to the relevant date for the purpose of deciding the question of jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* it could reasonably deduce that the investment could not qualify for the German-Philippine BIT protection regardless of whether the Pooling Agreement was amended in 2001 to provide with a shareholder structure which complied with Philippine law.442 The first criticism of a contradiction of reasons is accordingly inaccurate.\n\nAward, para. 385.\n\nAward, para. 395.\n\nAward, para. 313.\n\nAward, para. 315.\n\nAward, paras. 319-323.\n\nAward, para. 323.\n\nAward, para. 327.\n\nAward, paras. 398-401.\n\n276.\n\nThe parties expressed different views before the Tribunal as to whether the ADL criminalizes attempted violations.443 In Fraport\u2019s view, which it elaborated upon in its Observations regarding the Respondent\u2019s second post-hearing submission of 15 September 2006, the ADL does not define \"attempt\" as a punishable offense because no such language is present in the ADL. At any rate, Fraport further alleged that the acquisition of the ability to commit an offense does not constitute an attempt to commit such offense and added that there is no evidence that it intended to exercise any alleged rights under the 1999 Shareholder Agreements to intervene in PIATCO management. It said all that the Republic of the Philippines could demonstrate is an intent of Fraport to achieve such ability to intervene.444 Clearly, the Applicant disagrees both with the factual finding by the Tribunal of its awareness that its arrangements were not in accordance with the ADL as stated in the above cited paragraph 356 of the Award as well as with the consequences which the Tribunal made thereof.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations regarding Respondent\u2019s second post-hearing submission, paras. 114-116; Respondent\u2019s supplemental post-hearing Reply, paras. 94-117.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations regarding Respondent\u2019s second post-hearing submission, paras. 114-116.\n\n277.\n\nIt is not the task of the *ad hoc* Committee under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention to consider whether the reasons given by the Tribunal are convincing. As the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE* declared:\n\n\"[t]he adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph (1)(e), because it almost inevitably draws an ad hoc Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal's decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention. A Committee might be tempted to annul an award because that examination disclosed a manifestly incorrect application of the law, which, however, is not a ground for annulment.\"445\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi* also stated that \"it is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.\"446 The *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena v. Egypt* further made clear that \"[t]he ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal\u2019s decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not.\"447 The *ad hoc* Committee in *CDC v. Seychelles* also underlined that Article 52(1)(e) \"does not provide us with the opportunity to opine on whether the Tribunal\u2019s analysis was correct or its reasoning persuasive.\"448 The second criticism of a contradiction of reasons is also unfounded.\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v. Guinea,* Decision on Annulment, 22 December 1989, 4 ICSID Reports, p. 88, para. 5.08.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, *(\"Vivendi I\"), 6* ICSID Reports, p. 358, para. 64.\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Egypt,* Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2002, 6 ICSID Reports, p. 146, para. 79.\n\n*CDC* v. *Seychelles,* Decision on Annulment, 29 June 2005, 11 ICSID Reports, p. 260, para. 70.\n\n278.\n\nThe same applies to Fraport\u2019s further criticism that the ADL could be applicable to Terminal 3 as a public utility notwithstanding the nullification *ab initio* of the Terminal Concession by the Philippine Supreme Court. Such allegation is only an affirmation inspired by the Dissenting Opinion.449 While such a view was expressed in the Dissenting Opinion,450 the point formed no part of the reasoning of the Tribunal whose award cannot therefore be criticized on this ground.\n\nDissenting Opinion of Arbitrator B. Cremades, para. 25.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 25 and 26.\n\n279.\n\nFraport\u2019s criticism of the meaning of the QT Report and letter of 21 December 1999 in the Award and of the consequences which the Tribunal drew from it cannot be reviewed by the Committee without engaging in a discussion on the merits of the case. There is a long and consistent line of decisions of *ad hoc* committees to the effect that this does not square with the limited scope of review permitted under Article 52(1)(e). The Tribunal considered the disregard by Fraport\u2019s supervisory board of the QT report\u2019s warnings as incontrovertible evidence that Fraport\u2019s investment was knowingly made not in accordance with Philippine law. The expression \"this is a case in which *res ipsa loquitur\"* in paragraph 399 means that without possible contradiction, under all standards of proof which had been alluded to by the Tribunal, \"preponderance of evidence\" or \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\"451 the conclusion that Fraport\u2019s investment did not meet the requirements of Article 1 of the BIT was inescapable. Fraport deplores the conclusion of the Tribunal but its argument that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning was contradictory and incomplete is merely a criticism of the solution, a criticism which cannot be admitted by the Committee under this ground.\n\nAward, para. 399.\n\n280.\n\nThe Committee concludes that there was no lack of reasoning or contradictions in the reasoning of the Tribunal. Accordingly, the conditions for annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention are not present in the case at hand.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n281.\n\nThe parties have submitted their claims for costs upon the invitation of the Committee. Fraport\u2019s costs for its legal representation and expenses total US$ 2,378,902.75 and EUR 1,003,652.67, respectively. In addition, Fraport as the Applicant on Annulment, made, in accordance with Regulation l4(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, the whole advance payment to ICSID for the costs referred to in Regulation 14(2) of the said Regulations. The Respondent claims that it incurred in total legal fees and expenses in this annulment proceeding amounting to US$ 5,672,667.05. It requests the Committee to order the Applicant to reimburse the Respondent the costs of the latter\u2019s representation and assistance.452\n\nRejoinder, conclusion at p. 96.\n\n282.\n\nUnder Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j), read together with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 53, the Committee has the discretion to decide how and by whom the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding *(\"the parties\u2019 costs\"),* the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre *(together \"the ICSID costs\")* shall be borne.\n\n283.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that, in the circumstances of the present case, and having regard to its decision to annul the Award, it would not be reasonable and fair if it were to accede to the request of the Respondent and order the Applicant to reimburse the former the party costs of the Respondent\u2019s legal representation and assistance. Accordingly, the request of the Respondent on this point is denied.\n\n284.\n\nWith respect to the costs of Fraport for its legal representation and assistance the Committee notes that the Applicant in none of its submissions to the Committee, neither written nor oral, requested that it be reimbursed for such costs by the Respondent. But in any case, having regard to the Committee\u2019s conclusion that the Award is to be annulled on the ground that it was the Tribunal which seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure it would not be fair and reasonable, in the view of the Committee, if it were to decide that the Respondent would have to reimburse Fraport for the costs of its legal representation and assistance.\n\n285.\n\nAccordingly, each Party shall bear the costs of its legal representation. This decision applies equally to the costs, which were previously reserved, of the two interlocutory applications made to the *ad hoc* Committee.453\n\nReferred to *supra* at paras. 6 & 8.\n\n286.\n\nWith respect to the costs of the annulment proceeding itself, i.e., the costs incurred by ICSID, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee, the Committee first recalls that it reserved its decision on the allocation of costs relating to each Party\u2019s one request for incidental decision (see paragraphs 6 and 8 above) to the final stage of this annulment proceeding. Having regard to the circumstances of the case at hand, the Committee is of the view that it is appropriate and fair in the present case that ICSID costs be borne equally by both parties. Accordingly, the Respondent shall reimburse the Applicant half of the ICSID costs (including the costs of the interlocutory applications).454\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will in due course provide the parties with a financial statement on the costs of the proceeding.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n[287].\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee unanimously decides:\n\n\u2014 (1) To annul the Award of 16 August 2007 in *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide* v. *The Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25);\n\n\u2014 (2) Each Party shall bear one half of the ICSID costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding; and\n\n\u2014 (3) Each Party shall bear its own party costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding."}]}
