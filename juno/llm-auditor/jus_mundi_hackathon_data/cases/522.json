Procedural History\n1. On October 1, 2008, the Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration under the Treaty, calling for \u201cthe dispute [to] be resolved under the UNCITRAL Arbitration\u00a0Rules\u201d1 in accordance with Article XII(4) of the Treaty.\n2. By its Notice of Arbitration the Claimant notified the Respondent of its appointment\u00a0of Dr. Bernard Hanotiau as first arbitrator in these proceedings. The principal\u00a0developments thereafter are as follows:\n3. On October 21, 2008, the Respondent challenged the appointment of\u00a0Dr. Hanotiau.\n4. By letter dated October 29, 2008, the Respondent notified the Claimant of its\u00a0appointment of Professor Philippe Sands QC as second arbitrator in these\u00a0proceedings.\n5. By letter dated November 13, 2008, the Claimant challenged the appointment of\u00a0Professor Sands.\n6. On November 24, 2008, the Claimant requested that the Secretary-General of the\u00a0Permanent Court of Arbitration (\u201cPCA\u201d) designate an appointing authority under\u00a0the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules to decide on the cross-challenges to the\u00a0Claimant's and the Respondent's appointed co-arbitrators.\n7. On December 3, 2008, the Respondent objected to the PCA Secretary-General's\u00a0competence to designate an appointing authority and to the jurisdiction of any\u00a0tribunal constituted pursuant to the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Respondent\u00a0argued that an investor can only submit a dispute to arbitration under the\u00a0UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules if neither ICSID nor the Additional Facility of ICSID\u00a0are available (Article XII(4) of the Treaty).\n8. On December 11, 2008, the Claimant refuted the Respondent's objections. The\u00a0Claimant argued that \u201cArbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility is not\u00a0available\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Secretary-General of ICSID \u2026 has not approved the\u00a0Arbitration Agreement.\u201d2\n9. On the same day, the Respondent replied to the Claimant's letter reiterating the\u00a0objections raised in its letter of December 3, 2008.\n1 CEX-7, Notice of Arbitration, p. 2.\n2 REX-5, p. 2, Letter from Mr. C. Mark Baker.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 6 of 52\n10. On December 12, 2008, the PCA designated H.E. Judge Peter Tomka as appointing\u00a0authority, noting that Article 21(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides\u00a0that \u201c[t]he tribunal shall have the power to rule on objections that it has no\u00a0jurisdiction.\u201d\n11. On February 17, 2009, H.E. Judge Tomka resigned as appointing authority in this\u00a0matter. On February 26, 2009, further to a request from the Claimant to appoint a\u00a0replacement appointing authority, the Secretary-General of the PCA designated Mr.\u00a0Jernej Sekolec as appointing authority in this matter for all purposes under the\u00a0UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n12. By letter dated March 31, 2009, the PCA informed the Parties of Mr. Sekolec's\u00a0decisions on the challenges to Dr. Hanotiau and Professor Sands. The challenge to\u00a0Dr. Hanotiau was upheld. The challenge to Professor Sands was rejected.\n13. On April 29, 2009, the Claimant notified the Respondent of its appointment of Mr.\u00a0John Beechey as first arbitrator to replace Dr. Hanotiau.\n14. On June 5, 2009, the Claimant informed Mr. Sekolec that the co-arbitrators had\u00a0been unable to appoint a Presiding Arbitrator within the time limit provided by\u00a0Article 7(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and requested that he proceed to\u00a0appoint the Presiding Arbitrator.\n15. Mr. Sekolec conducted a list procedure in accordance with Article 6(3)(a) of the\u00a0UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and, upon failure of the list procedure, a\u00a0supplemental procedure to appoint the Presiding Arbitrator. Upon the failure of the\u00a0supplemental procedure, Mr. Sekolec proceeded directly to appoint Professor Juan\u00a0Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto as Presiding Arbitrator.\n16. On September 30, 2009, once the Tribunal had been constituted in accordance with\u00a0the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, a first procedural meeting was held between the\u00a0Parties and the Tribunal at the seat of the PCA in The Hague. At the procedural\u00a0meeting, following discussions with the Parties, the Tribunal decided that there\u00a0would be a preliminary procedure concerning the interpretation and application of\u00a0Article XII(4) of the Treaty and its consequences (the \u201cPreliminary Issue\u201d) and\u00a0agreed with the Parties on a schedule for submissions regarding the Preliminary\u00a0Issue.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 7 of 52\n17. Following discussions with the Parties during the procedural hearing, the Tribunal\u00a0decided on October 8, 2009 to fix The Hague as place of arbitration.3\n18. After having provided the Parties with an opportunity to present their comments on\u00a0a previous draft and having considered these comments, the Tribunal issued\u00a0Procedural Order No. 1 on October 26, 2009, which set forth further procedural\u00a0rules to govern this arbitration and the schedule for submissions agreed with the\u00a0Parties to be followed with regard to the Preliminary Issue. In addition, the Tribunal\u00a0noted that it would reserve February 1, 2010 for a telephone conference with the\u00a0Parties if either of the Parties so requested no later than January 18, 2010.\n19. On October 29, 2009, the Respondent submitted a brief presenting its arguments\u00a0with respect to the Preliminary Issue (\u201cRespondent's Brief on the Preliminary\u00a0Issue\u201d), together with its supporting documents and a legal opinion by Prof. Dr.\u00a0August Reinisch (\u201cReinisch Legal Opinion\u201d).\n20. On November 17, 2009, after having provided the Parties with an opportunity to\u00a0present their comments on a previous draft and having considered these comments,\u00a0the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, which set out the rules on\u00a0confidentiality which shall govern this arbitration.\n21. On December 3, 2009, the Claimant submitted a brief presenting its arguments with\u00a0respect to the Preliminary Issue (\u201cClaimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue\u201d),\u00a0together with its supporting documents and a legal opinion by Prof. Dr. Rudolf\u00a0Dolzer (\u201cDolzer Legal Opinion\u201d).\n22. On December 10, 2009, in response to a request by the Respondent, the Tribunal\u00a0granted the Respondent an extension of five days for the submission of its reply\u00a0brief on the Preliminary Issue.4 On December 15, 2009, in response to a request by\u00a0the Claimant, an equal extension was accorded to the Claimant for the submission\u00a0of the rejoinder brief on the Preliminary Issue.5\n23. On December 22, 2009, the Respondent submitted a reply brief on the Preliminary\u00a0Issue (\u201cRespondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue\u201d), responding to the\u00a0arguments raised in the Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, and submitting a\u00a0second legal opinion by Prof. Dr. August Reinisch (\u201cReinisch Second Legal\n3 A-1, Letter from the PCA on behalf of the Tribunal to the Parties.\n4 A-10, Letter from the PCA on behalf of the Tribunal to the Parties.\n5 A-10 and A-11, Letters from the PCA on behalf of the Tribunal to the Parties.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 8 of 52\nOpinion\u201d), as well as an additional legal opinion by Mr. Barton Legum (\u201cLegum Legal Opinion\u201d) and supporting exhibits.\n24. On January 18, 2010, the Claimant submitted a rejoinder brief on the Preliminary\u00a0Issue (\u201cClaimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue\u201d), responding to the\u00a0arguments raised in the Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue and\u00a0submitting a second legal opinion by Prof. Dr. Rudolf Dolzer (\u201cDolzer Second\u00a0Legal Opinion\u201d), as well as an additional legal opinion by Ms. Ana Palacio\u00a0(\u201cPalacio Legal Opinion\u201d) and supporting exhibits.\n25. On January 18, 2010, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it \u201cconsiders that the\u00a0parties' extensive written submissions, and accompanying evidence, already provide\u00a0all the elements needed for a ruling on the Preliminary Issue, without the need to\u00a0hold a hearing by telephone or in person.\u201d6\n26. On January 19, 2010, the Respondent communicated to the Tribunal that \u201cgiven the\u00a0strictly legal nature of the Preliminary Issue and the submissions of the parties [\u2026]\u00a0Venezuela does not believe it necessary that a hearing be held. [\u2026However,]\u00a0Venezuela believes that a telephone conference could be quite useful.\u201d7\n27. On February 15, 2010, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, \u201c[a]fter having\u00a0reviewed the Parties' submissions addressing the Preliminary Issue, and bearing in\u00a0mind the Parties' comments \u2026 the Tribunal finds no need to hold a telephone\u00a0conference or hearing with the Parties on the Preliminary Issue.\u201d\n28. Accordingly, the Tribunal proceeded to decide the Preliminary Issue upon the basis\u00a0of the written submissions filed by the Parties.\n6 C-10, Letter from the Claimant to the Tribunal.\n7 R-13, Letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction\nApril 22, 2010\nPage 9 of 52\nIV. Introduction to the dispute\n29. The Claimant brings a claim under the Treaty and describes its claim as follows:\nThe dispute is in connection with certain measures by Venezuela (including its integral parts, instrumentalities, agencies, and continent\u00a0subdivisions) (\u201cVenezuela's Measures\u201d) which are in breach of the\u00a0Treaty and comprise, but are not limited to, the following:\n(i) Venezuela's decision to unilaterally and unlawfully suspend\u00a0and/or cancel, as of December 27, 2007, coal supplies owed to\u00a0Nova Scotia Power under a Coal Supply Agreement of October\u00a018th, 2005 (along with confirmation letters, transactions, and\u00a0related documents, the \u201cCSA\u201d), entered into by Nova Scotia\u00a0Power and Guasare Coal International N.V. (\u201cGuasare\u201d), an\u00a0enterprise controlled by Venezuela [\u2026]; and\n(ii) Venezuela's unlawful attempts to impose a mandatory renegotiation of the CSA.8\n30. Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal decided that there would be a\u00a0preliminary procedure concerning the interpretation and application of\u00a0Article XII(4) of the Treaty and its consequences.\n8 CEX-7, Notice of Arbitration, p. 2.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 10 of 52\nV. Relevant legal provisions\nV.1 The Treaty\n31. Article XII(4) of the Treaty provides as follows:\nThe dispute may, by the investor concerned, be submitted to arbitration under:\n(a) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment\u00a0Disputes (ICSID), established pursuant to the Convention on the\u00a0Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals\u00a0of the other States, opened for signature at Washington 18\u00a0March, 1965 (ICSID Convention), provided that both the\u00a0disputing Contracting Party and the Contracting Party of the\u00a0investor are parties to the ICSID Convention; or\n(b) the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, provided that either the\u00a0disputing Contracting Party or the Contracting Party of the\u00a0investor, but not both, is party to the ICSID Convention; or\nIn case neither of the procedures mentioned above is available, the investor may submit the dispute to an international arbitrator or ad\u00a0hoc arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the\u00a0United Nations Commission on International Trade Law\u00a0(UNCITRAL).\nV.2 The Additional Facility Rules\n32. Articles 2 and 4 of the Additional Facility Rules provide as follows:\nArticle 2\nAdditional Facility Rules\nThe Secretariat of the Centre is hereby authorized to administer, subject to and in accordance with these Rules, proceedings between a\u00a0State (or a constituent subdivision or agency of a State) and a national\u00a0of another State, falling within the following categories:\n(a) conciliation and arbitration proceedings for the settlement\u00a0of legal disputes arising directly out of an investment\u00a0which are not within the jurisdiction of the Centre because\u00a0either the State party to the dispute or the State whose\u00a0national is a party to the dispute is not a Contracting State;\n(b) conciliation and arbitration proceedings for the settlement\u00a0of legal disputes which are not within the jurisdiction of\u00a0the Centre because they do not arise directly out of an\u00a0investment, provided that either the State party to the\u00a0dispute or the State whose national is a party to the dispute\u00a0is a Contracting State; and\n(c) fact-finding proceedings.\nThe administration of proceedings authorized by these Rules is hereinafter referred to as the Additional Facility.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction\nApril 22, 2010\nPage 11 of 52\n[\u2026]\nArticle 4 Access to the Additional Facility\u00a0in Respect of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings\u00a0Subject to Secretary-General's Approval\n(1) Any agreement providing for conciliation or arbitration\u00a0proceedings under the Additional Facility in respect of existing or\u00a0future disputes requires the approval of the Secretary-General. The\u00a0parties may apply for such approval at any time prior to the institution\u00a0of proceedings by submitting to the Secretariat a copy of the agreement\u00a0concluded or proposed to be concluded between them together with\u00a0other relevant documentation and such additional information as the\u00a0Secretariat may reasonably request.\n(2) In the case of an application based on Article 2(a), the\u00a0Secretary-General shall give his approval only if (a) he is satisfied that\u00a0the requirements of that provision are fulfilled at the time, and (b) both\u00a0parties give their consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre under Article\u00a025 of the Convention (in lieu of the Additional Facility) in the event\u00a0that the jurisdictional requirements ratione personae of that Article\u00a0shall have been met at the time when proceedings are instituted.\n(3) In the case of an application based on Article 2(b), the\u00a0Secretary-General shall give his approval only if he is satisfied (a) that\u00a0the requirements of that provision are fulfilled, and (b) that the\u00a0underlying transaction has features which distinguish it from an\u00a0ordinary commercial transaction.\n(4) If in the case of an application based on Article 2(b) the\u00a0jurisdictional requirements ratione personae of Article 25 of the\u00a0Convention shall have been met and the Secretary-General is of the\u00a0opinion that it is likely that a Conciliation Commission or Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal, as the case may be, will hold that the dispute arises directly\u00a0out of an investment, he may make his approval of the application\u00a0conditional upon consent by both parties to submit any dispute in the\u00a0first instance to the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n(5) The Secretary-General shall as soon as possible notify the\u00a0parties whether he approves or disapproves the agreement of the\u00a0parties. He may hold discussions with the parties or invite the parties to\u00a0a meeting with the officials of the Secretariat either at the parties'\u00a0request or at his own initiative. The Secretary-General shall, upon the\u00a0request of the parties or any of them, keep confidential any or all\u00a0information furnished to him by such parties or party in connection\u00a0with the provisions of this Article.\n(6) The Secretary-General shall record his approval of an\u00a0agreement pursuant to this Article together with the names and\u00a0addresses of the parties in a register to be maintained at the Secretariat\u00a0for that purpose.\nV.3 The Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules\n33. The relevant provisions of Schedule C to Additional Facility Rules (the \u201cArbitration\u00a0(Additional Facility) Rules\u201d) are as follows:\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 12 of 52\nArticle 2 The Request\n(1) Any State or any national of a State wishing to institute arbitration proceedings shall send a request to that effect in writing to\u00a0the Secretariat at the seat of the Centre. It shall be drawn up in an\u00a0official language of the Centre, shall be dated and shall be signed by\u00a0the requesting party or its duly authorized representative.\n(2) The request may be made jointly by the parties to the\u00a0dispute.\nArticle 3 Contents of the Request\n(1) The request shall:\n(a) designate precisely each party to the dispute and state the address of each;\n(b) set forth the relevant provisions embodying the agreement of the parties to refer the dispute to arbitration;\n(c) indicate the date of approval by the Secretary-General\u00a0pursuant to Article 4 of the Additional Facility Rules of the\u00a0agreement of the parties providing for access to the\u00a0Additional Facility;\n(d) contain information concerning the issues in dispute and\u00a0an indication of the amount involved, if any; and\n(e) state, if the requesting party is a juridical person, that it has\u00a0taken all necessary internal actions to authorize the\u00a0request.\n(2) The request may in addition set forth any provisions agreed by the parties regarding the number of arbitrators and the\u00a0method of their appointment, as well as any other provisions agreed\u00a0concerning the settlement of the dispute.\n(3) The request shall be accompanied by five additional signed\u00a0copies and by the fee prescribed pursuant to Regulation 16 of the\u00a0Administrative and Financial Regulation of the Centre.\nArticle 4 Registration of the Request\nAs soon as the Secretary-General shall have satisfied himself that the request conforms in form and substance to the provisions of\u00a0Article 3 of these Rules, he shall register the request in the Arbitration\u00a0(Additional Facility) Register and on the same day dispatch to the\u00a0parties a notice of registration. He shall also transmit a copy of the\u00a0request and of the accompanying documentation (if any) to the other\u00a0party to the dispute.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 13 of 52\nVI. Summary of the Parties' Positions\n34. The Preliminary Issue has been extensively pleaded by the Parties. The Respondent\u00a0submitted a Brief on the Preliminary Issue, dated October 29, 2009, to which the\u00a0Claimant responded with its Brief on the Preliminary Issue, dated December 3,\u00a02009. The Respondent submitted a Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, dated\u00a0December 22, 2009, to which the Claimant responded with a Rejoinder Brief on the\u00a0Preliminary Issue dated January 18, 2010. Attached to these written pleadings were\u00a0a significant number of exhibits, including a number of experts' reports in the form\u00a0of legal opinions and statements. What follows is a summary of the positions of the\u00a0Parties, without prejudice to the Parties' full arguments as submitted in their written\u00a0pleadings, including supporting documents and experts' reports, that the Tribunal\u00a0has taken into consideration in making its determinations.\nVI.1 Interpretation of Article XII(4) of the Treaty and the meaning of \u201cavailable\u201d\nA. The Respondent\n35. The Respondent argues that in accordance with the plain language of the Treaty, an\u00a0investor may submit a dispute to an arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration\u00a0Rules only if arbitration under ICSID or the Additional Facility is not \u201cavailable.\u201d\u00a0The Respondent invokes the Reinisch Legal Opinion9 to the effect that the\u00a0interpretation of the Treaty is governed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of\u00a0Treaties (the \u201cVienna Convention\u201d), in particular its Article 31(1). The Respondent\u00a0submits that supplementary means of interpretation are available under Article 32 of\u00a0the Vienna Convention only if the ordinary meaning is ambiguous.\n36. The Respondent submits that \u201c[t]here can be no other conclusion from reading\u00a0Article XII(4) of the Treaty, but that its natural and ordinary meaning establishes a\u00a0hierarchy for submission of disputes \u2013 first to ICSID, if the stated conditions in\u00a0subparagraph (a) are met, then to the Additional Facility if the conditions in\u00a0subparagraph (b) are met. Only then \u2013 \u2018in case neither' of those two procedures are\u00a0\u2018available,' can the investor seek arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules.\u201d10 The\u00a0Respondent asserts that the ordinary meaning of the Spanish and French versions of\u00a0the Treaty confirm the English language version and its interpretation.11\n9 Reinisch Legal Opinion, \u00b62.\n10 R-5, Respondent's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b614.\n11 R-5, Respondent's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b615; R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary\u00a0Issue, \u00b6\u00b617-18\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\nPage 14 of 52\n37. The Respondent further asserts that arbitration clauses in other bilateral investment\u00a0treaties (\u201cBITs\u201d) adopted by Canada and Venezuela support the Respondent's\u00a0argument that the Treaty provides for a hierarchical scheme of arbitral fora. The\u00a0majority of the Respondent's current BITs establish that arbitration under the\u00a0UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules is available only if neither ICSID nor the Additional\u00a0Facility are available, whereas only four BITs (two of them not yet in force) allow\u00a0an investor to choose international arbitral fora without any hierarchy.12\n38. The great majority of the BITs signed by Canada give the investor the option to\u00a0choose to submit the dispute to any one of ICSID, the ICSID Additional Facility, or\u00a0to ad hoc arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.13 The fact that such\u00a0an arrangement was not included in the Treaty \u201cdemonstrates that Venezuela and\u00a0Canada specifically negotiated a clause adopting Venezuela's typical formulation as\u00a0opposed to Canada's.\u201d14\n39. The Respondent further submits that the Claimant has conceded that a good faith\u00a0reading of Article XII(4) of the Treaty requires an investor to submit in the first\u00a0instance to arbitration under the Additional Facility.15 The Respondent considers\u00a0that the Claimant relies on \u201cinventive definitions of \u2018available' and novel\u00a0explanations of the workings of the Additional Facility\u201d to argue that the Additional\u00a0Facility was not \u201cavailable.\u201d16\n40. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant's definition of \u201cavailable\u201d in Article\u00a0XII(4) (i.e., \u201cready for immediate use\u201d and \u201chas a solid prospect of success\u201d) is\u00a0narrow and without foundation. The Respondent maintains that the ordinary\u00a0meaning of \u201cavailable\u201d is \u201caccessible,\u201d \u201cobtainable,\u201d \u201cattainable,\u201d \u201cprocurable,\u201d\u00a0\u201ccapable of producing the desired result\u201d or \u201cwithin one's reach.\u201d The Respondent\u00a0invokes the Reinisch Legal Opinion and the definition found in the Shorter Oxford\u00a0Dictionary,17 noting that the dictionary definitions quoted by the Claimant support\u00a0the Respondent's approach.18 The Respondent argues that the Claimant's reliance\u00a0on a definition of \u201cavailable\u201d as \u201cpresent or ready for immediate use\u201d is\n12 REX-11, Venezuelan Bilateral Investment Treaties Chart\n13 R-5, Respondent's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b624-25 and footnote 33.\n14 R-5, Respondent's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b626.\n15 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b69-10.\n16 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b610.\n17 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b611; REX-9, Shorter Oxford English Dictionary,\u00a05th ed.\n18 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b612.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 15 of 52\ninappropriate because, as explained by the dictionary itself, the idea that \u201cavailable\u201d means \u201cready for immediate use\u201d refers to resources, not dispute resolution\u00a0mechanisms.19\n41. The Respondent further asserts that accepting the Claimant's definition of\u00a0\u201cavailable\u201d would produce an absurd result. If Claimant's view that the Additional\u00a0Facility is not \u201cready for immediate use\u201d because certain procedural steps need to be\u00a0taken were accepted, then no arbitral forum would be available, because parties\u00a0must always undertake some procedural steps in order to initiate proceedings.20 The\u00a0Respondent states that none of the treaties relied on by the Claimant defines or\u00a0explains the term \u201cavailable\u201d and that they come from different contexts.21 The\u00a0Respondent argues that the Claimant distorts a passage on local remedies in Mr.\u00a0Paulsson's treatise on denial of justice regarding whether dispute resolution\u00a0mechanisms should be considered available when they are unlikely to succeed.22\u00a0According to the Respondent, this treatise actually supports the idea that investors\u00a0should make reasonable attempts before concluding that local remedies are\u00a0unavailable.23\n42. The Respondent notes that the Claimant argues, in the context of the availability of\u00a0ICSID, that it is \u201cunavailable,\u201d because the ratione personae requirements of Article\u00a025(1) of the ICSID Convention are not met. According to the Respondent, the\u00a0Claimant \u201cneglects to mention, however, that these ratione personae requirements\u00a0are the same requirements expressly referred to in Article XII(4) of the Treaty to\u00a0determine the \u2018availability' of both ICSID and the Additional Facility.\u201d24 Therefore,\u00a0the same meaning should be given to \u201cavailable\u201d in the context of the Additional\u00a0Facility.\n43. Finally, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's argument that the object and purpose\u00a0of the Treaty requires a default interpretation of Article XII(4) in favour of an\u00a0investor. In this regard the Respondent invokes the Reinisch Legal Opinion.25\n19 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b613-14.\n20 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b615.\n21 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b620-27, 30-31.\n22 CEXL-12, Jan Paulsson, Denial of Justice in International Law (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\u00a02005) at 130.\n23 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b628.\n24 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b632 (emphasis in original).\n25 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b687-93; Reinisch Second Legal Opinion, \u00b6\u00b648, 5965.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 16 of 52\nB. The Claimant\n44. The Claimant argues that Article XII(4) of the Treaty contains the Respondent's\u00a0firm offer to resolve Treaty-related disputes under the UNCITRAL Arbitration\u00a0Rules, provided that ICSID and the Additional Facility are unavailable.\n45. According to the Claimant, the Treaty does not require that the Claimant make the\u00a0Additional Facility available, nor do the Additional Facility Rules contemplate the\u00a0possibility that the Claimant make the Additional Facility available without the\u00a0active cooperation of the Respondent, which has not happened.26 The Claimant\u00a0asserts that the Respondent did not officially reply to the Notice of Dispute,27 which\u00a0raised the possibility of taking the case to the Additional Facility or to arbitration\u00a0under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.28\n46. The Claimant asserts that the Respondent's lack of cooperation was not due to a\u00a0lack of awareness or understanding of the Treaty as (1) the Respondent has already\u00a0participated in other cases before the Additional Facility under the Treaty; (2) the\u00a0Respondent, as a member of ICSID, has drafted and enacted the Additional Facility\u00a0Rules; and (3) the Respondent was one of the authors, together with Canada, of the\u00a0dispute resolution mechanisms foreseen in the Treaty.29\n47. The Claimant highlights the fact that the language used in Article XII(4) of the\u00a0Treaty is \u201cmay\u201d \u2013 thus optional \u2013 whereas in other treaties the word used is \u201cshall\u201d30\u00a0\u2013 hence mandatory.31 The Claimant also contends that these differences demonstrate\u00a0that no \u201ctypical formulation\u201d exists within the Respondent's treaties. The Claimant\u00a0asserts that \u201c[t]he Contracting Parties to the Canada-Venezuela BIT clearly\u00a0appreciated the distinction between mandatory and permissive language.\u201d32\n48. Regarding the meaning of \u201cavailable\u201d in Article XII(4), the Claimant submits that\u00a0Canada and Venezuela unconditionally consented to have Treaty-related disputes\u00a0submitted to arbitration. As for the forum, the Claimant asserts that an investor is\n26 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b67.\n27 CEX-6, Claimant's Notice of Dispute.\n28 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b67.\n29 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b68.\n30 CEXL-17, Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion\u00a0and Reciprocal Protection of Investments; CEXL-18, Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of\u00a0Investments between the Government of the Republic of Paraguay and the Government of the Republic of\u00a0Venezuela.\n31 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b659-60.\n32 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b661-62.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\nPage 17 of 52\nentitled to commence proceedings under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules if ICSID and the Additional Facility are not available. As the Treaty does not define\u00a0\u201cavailable,\u201d the interpretation is to follow the approach set out in the Vienna\u00a0Convention.33 The Claimant relies on an opinion by Professor Rudolf Dolzer that\u00a0argues that the ordinary meaning is the dominant criterion and should be applied in\u00a0preference to any other criteria.34 The Claimant disputes the assertion that the\u00a0Vienna Convention requires reference to other treaty language as a relevant means\u00a0of interpretation.35\n49. According to the Claimant, the ordinary meaning of \u201cavailable\u201d is that something is\u00a0\u201cpresent or ready for immediate use\u201d36 or \u201csomething that is likely to succeed.\u201d37\u00a0The Claimant refers to several treaties that allegedly use \u201cavailable\u201d in that sense \u2014\u00a0e.g., \u201creasonable efforts to exhaust available remedies to enforce the award\u201d38\u2014 and\u00a0refers to commentators who argue that \u201cwhen the term is used in this context,\u00a0dispute resolution mechanisms that are unlikely to succeed must be considered\u00a0unavailable.\u201d39 The Claimant also relies on the Dolzer Legal Opinion which finds\u00a0that a dispute resolution mechanism such as arbitration in the Additional Facility\u00a0cannot be considered to be \u201cavailable\u201d when there is a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as to\u00a0whether the parties would be allowed to use it.40\n50. The Claimant concludes that, in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the term\u00a0\u201cavailable,\u201d ICSID and the Additional Facility can only be considered to be\u00a0\u201cavailable\u201d when they are \u201cimmediately ready for use\u201d and when there is a\u00a0\u201creasonable prospect that access to them will be granted.\u201d41 The Claimant asserts\u00a0that the other criteria set out in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, i.e., the\u00a0object and purpose of the Treaty and good faith, support a broad interpretation of\u00a0the Treaty terms and a preference for greater investor protection.

The Respondent\n51. The Respondent argues that, unlike ICSID, the Additional Facility is available and,\u00a0consequently, the Claimant is bound to submit the dispute to arbitration under those\u00a0Rules. The Respondent is a party to ICSID and the ratione personae requirements\u00a0are met. Accordingly, the Additional Facility is \u201cavailable\u201d within the meaning of\u00a0Article XII(4)(b).\n52. The Respondent accepts that access to the Additional Facility is subject to approval\u00a0by the Secretary-General as required by Article 4 of the Additional Facility Rules.\u00a0Although approval is not automatic, the Respondent argues that it may be obtained\u00a0with ease, subject only to the Claimant actually requesting approval and the\u00a0fulfilment of the conditions set forth in Articles 2 and 4 of the Additional Facility\u00a0Rules.43 In support of this view, the Respondent invokes the Legum Legal\u00a0Opinion.44\n53. Contrary to the Claimant's position, the Respondent states that approval of an\u00a0application to access the Additional Facility may be requested prior to, or together\u00a0with, the Request for Arbitration, and that in practice the request for approval is\u00a0almost always submitted with the Request for Arbitration.45 The Respondent asserts\u00a0that the Additional Facility Rules do not require that parties request approval jointly.\u00a0This point reflected in a letter from the current ICSID Secretary-General, which\u00a0refers to the possibility of only one party requesting approval.46 The Respondent\u00a0further refers to Articles 2(1) and 2(2) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules\u00a0which indicate that the request may be made by \u201cany State or national\u201d and that the\u00a0request \u201cmay be made jointly by the parties to the dispute.\u201d The Legum Legal\u00a0Opinion states that \u201c[i]n none of the cases under the ICSID Additional Facility in\u00a0which I acted as counsel has a joint application been made.\u201d47\n42 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b689-95.\n43 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b633-38.\n44 Legum Legal Opinion, \u00b6\u00b626-29.\n45 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b639-41; Legum Legal Opinion, \u00b6\u00b620-22.\n46 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b642-43; REX-19, Letter from Secretary-General\u00a0Meg Kinnear.\n47 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b644-46; Legum Legal Opinion, \u00b6\u00b624-25.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 19 of 52\n54. The Respondent rejects the Claimant's argument that there are two types of\u00a0applications for approval. According to the Respondent, Article 2 of the Additional\u00a0Facility Rules provides two categories of proceedings. However, nowhere in the\u00a0Additional Facility Rules or on the ICSID website does there appear a reference to\u00a0the existence of two types of applications, nor does a requirement exist that a\u00a0respondent agree with how a claimant characterizes its application. The Respondent\u00a0states that the only necessary agreement is an agreement to arbitrate under the\u00a0ICSID Additional Facility Rules, which exists in this case as the Claimant accepted\u00a0the Respondent's offer under the Treaty.48\n55. The Respondent asserts that the mere requirement to seek the Secretary-General's\u00a0approval does not render the Additional Facility unavailable. Any other\u00a0interpretation would render the provision of Article XII(4)(b) of the Treaty\u00a0irrelevant. On the Claimant's argument, \u201cthe Additional Facility would never be\u00a0available.\u201d49\n56. Moreover, disputes under the Treaty have already been submitted and approved for\u00a0arbitration under the Additional Facility by the Secretary-General, including one on\u00a0October 28, 2004. Thus, \u201cthe fact that the same provision of this very same Treaty\u00a0has already been approved in another dispute between a Canadian investor and\u00a0Venezuela is strong support for the likely availability of the Additional Facility for\u00a0this dispute.\u201d50 Consequently, not having prior approval from the Secretary-General\u00a0does not indicate that the Additional Facility was not available, as no request for\u00a0approval was ever made by the Claimant. The Additional Facility Rules and the\u00a0ICSID website provide detailed instructions on how to seek the Secretary-General's\u00a0approval, as well as the specific criteria to be considered. The Claimant's assertion\u00a0that the Additional Facility is the \u201cblack hole of ICSID, which is not described to\u00a0the Investor in publicly available documents,\u201d51 is wrong. The Respondent notes\u00a0that \u201cthe Secretary-General has approved the 26 requests for access to the\u00a0Additional Facility it has received since the forum's inception.\u201d52\n57. The Respondent asserts that the Additional Facility was \u201cready for immediate use.\u201d\u00a0According to the Respondent, an application for approval did not require the\u00a0Respondent's collaboration, and it was for the Claimant to request approval from\n48 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b647-52.\n49 R-5, Respondent's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b631.\n50 R-5, Respondent's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b632.\n51 R-5, Respondent's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b635.\n52 R-5, Respondent's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b640.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 20 of 52\nICSID's Secretary-General. The Respondent asserts that it had no obligation to reply to the Claimant's Notice of Dispute and that the Claimant could have sought\u00a0approval without the Respondent's support.53 The Respondent concludes that the\u00a0Additional Facility was immediately available; the Claimant merely needed to\u00a0submit with its Request for Arbitration a copy of the Treaty and a request for access\u00a0to the Additional Facility.54 An application for use of the Additional Facility had an\u00a0\u201cextremely high prospect of success\u201d as, on the date the Claimant filed its Request\u00a0for UNCITRAL arbitration, the Additional Facility was available ratione\u00a0personae.55\n58. The Parties did not have to file a joint application or agree under which category of\u00a0disputes described in Article 2 of the Additional Facility Rules the proceedings\u00a0would fall. The Respondent refers to the Vannessa Ventures case,56 arising out of\u00a0the same Treaty, which was submitted to the Additional Facility, and where the\u00a0Respondent challenged the assertion made by Vannessa Ventures Ltd. that its\u00a0dispute arose out of an investment.57\n59. According to the Respondent, in the Vannessa Ventures case, the claimant requested\u00a0the approval to access arbitration against Venezuela under the Additional Facility as\u00a0provided for in the Treaty, together with its Request for Arbitration. After a request\u00a0from the Secretary-General to Vannessa Ventures Ltd. to provide further\u00a0information, and a letter from the Attorney-General of Venezuela contending that\u00a0the claimant had not complied with the requirements (which was replied to and\u00a0countered by Vannessa Ventures Ltd.), ICSID's Secretary-General approved the\u00a0request by Vannessa Ventures Ltd. to access the Additional Facility.58 The\u00a0Respondent also mentions a second case under the Treaty which has obtained\u00a0approval to access the Additional Facility.59\n53 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b653-58.\n54 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b660-65.\n55 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b667.\n56 Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v.

Finally, amendment of Article 4(6) of the Additional Facility Rules does not cast\u00a0any uncertainty over the possibility of success of a request by the Claimant to access\u00a0the Additional Facility.60\nB. The Claimant\n61. The Claimant notes that it is undisputed that ICSID is not available to resolve this\u00a0dispute.61 The Claimant agrees that the Additional Facility Rules set out the\u00a0requirements to guide a determination as to when the Additional Facility is\u00a0available.62 The Claimant contests the view that the instructions on the ICSID\u00a0website have any relevance to this determination.63\n62. The Claimant asserts that the Respondent acknowledges that any agreement to use\u00a0the Additional Facility requires the approval of ICSID's Secretary-General and that\u00a0the Secretary-General of ICSID has never approved an agreement to use the\u00a0Additional Facility in relation to this dispute.64 The Claimant challenges the view\u00a0that availability of the Additional Facility depends solely on ICSID membership.65\n63. The Claimant criticizes the Respondent for having only addressed how the\u00a0Secretary-General grants approval in practice, refraining from analyzing the\u00a0substance of the relevant Articles of the Additional Facility Rules. The Claimant\u00a0notes that the Treaty and the Additional Facility Rules must be interpreted as written\u00a0and that alleged practices invoked by the Respondent cannot constitute a subsequent\u00a0agreement or practice in relation to the Treaty and the Additional Facility Rules in\u00a0the sense of Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention. They are not relevant to the\u00a0interpretation of these texts and must be disregarded.66\n64. The Claimant argues that the purported ICSID practices should be disregarded,\u00a0because (1) administrative practices are irrelevant and the Tribunal must stay true to\u00a0the text of the Treaty and Additional Facility Rules as written;67 (2) the Respondent\n60 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b679-84.\n61 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b628\n62 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b66.\n63 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b633.\n64 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b66.\n65 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b656-64.\n66 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b632; C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary\u00a0Issue, \u00b6\u00b636-50.\n67 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b6101-104.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction\nApril 22, 2010\nPage 22 of 52\nhas failed to prove the practices it relies on;68 (3) even if relevant and proven, evidence of these purported practices was not publicly available at the time the\u00a0Claimant initiated the proceedings;69 and (4) the alleged practices could have\u00a0changed without notice. The Claimant asserts that the statement by the current\u00a0ICSID Secretary-General, Ms. Meg Kinnear,70 does not support the Respondent's\u00a0position as it does not even refer to the process of approval for the use of the\u00a0Additional Facility, but rather to the process to register an arbitration request which,\u00a0under the Additional Facility Rules and the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules,\u00a0respectively, are subject to different requirements.71 The Claimant also refutes the\u00a0Respondent's argument based on the fact that a dispute arising out of the same\u00a0Treaty (i.e., the Vannessa Ventures case) has been approved by the SecretaryGeneral. The Claimant notes that the Secretary-General's approval is granted on a\u00a0case-by-case basis and only when the requirements of the Additional Facility Rules\u00a0are met. Furthermore, approval in a previous case under the same treaty is not\u00a0binding.72\n65. The Claimant contends that, according to Articles 2 and 4 of the Additional Facility\u00a0Rules, which determine which cases can access the Additional Facility, the\u00a0Additional Facility was not available for the present dispute. The Claimant invokes\u00a0the Dolzer Legal Opinion in support of this view.73 The Claimant notes that under\u00a0Article 4(1) of the Additional Facility Rules, any agreement to arbitrate in the\u00a0Additional Facility requires the approval of the ICSID Secretary-General. Contrary\u00a0to the Respondent's view, the Claimant argues that the granting of such approval is\u00a0not automatic or a matter of apparent ease. According to the Additional Facility\u00a0Rules, approval is only granted if the Secretary-General is satisfied that the\u00a0requirements have been met.74 Moreover, the Additional Facility Rules only\u00a0contemplate requests for approval filed prior to the commencement of proceedings;\u00a0it is not possible to submit an application together with the notice of arbitration.75\n68 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b6105-108.\n69 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b634; C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary\u00a0Issue, \u00b6109.\n70 REX-19, Letter from Secretary-General Meg Kinnear.\n71 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6116-120.\n72 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b634, 79-82.\n73 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b69; CEXL-3, Dolzer Legal Opinion.\n74 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b631.\n75 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b635.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 23 of 52\n66. The Claimant argues that, in accordance with Article 4(1) of the Additional Facility\u00a0Rules, the approval must be sought by \u201cthe parties,\u201d and that a unilateral application\u00a0is not permissible. Rather, both parties are required to apply for the approval of the\u00a0agreement. The Respondent must therefore be one of the applicants.76 The Claimant\u00a0argues that in order to obtain approval of the agreement under the Additional\u00a0Facility, parties can file one of two types of applications, one based on Article 2(a),\u00a0or another one based on Article 2(b) of the Additional Facility Rules.\n67. Under Article 2(a) of the Additional Facility Rules, the Claimant notes that the\u00a0application must fulfill three requirements: (1) it must involve \u201clegal disputes\u00a0arising directly out of an investment\u201d; (2) the dispute cannot be \u201cwithin the\u00a0jurisdiction of ICSID\u201d; and (3) both parties must \u201cgive their consent to the\u00a0jurisdiction of the Centre (in lieu of the Additional Facility) under Article 25 of the\u00a0Convention in the event that the jurisdictional requirements ratione personae of that\u00a0Article are met at the time when proceedings are instituted.\u201d The Claimant\u00a0concludes, invoking the Dolzer Legal Opinion, that \u201cif the respondent State takes\u00a0the position that the dispute does not arise out of an investment because the claimant\u00a0does not own any investment, then access to the Additional Facility cannot be\u00a0granted under Article 2(a) of the Additional Facility Rules as written.\u201d77\n68. Under Article 2(b) of the Additional Facility Rules, the Claimant observes that an\u00a0application must involve \u201clegal disputes which are not within the jurisdiction of the\u00a0Centre because they do not arise directly out of an investment.\u201d78 The Claimant thus\u00a0concludes that the Additional Facility Rules require that the Parties agree on\u00a0whether there is an investment and on whether the dispute arises out of it, and that\u00a0this agreement must be reached before obtaining approval from the SecretaryGeneral of ICSID.79\n69. The Claimant contends that the Additional Facility was not available because the\u00a0Secretary-General had not approved their agreement.80 This view is confirmed by\u00a0the fact that the Respondent did not reply to the Notice of Dispute,81 even after a\n76 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b639-41.\n77 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b643-44.\n78 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b645.\n79 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b646-47.\n80 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b650-51; C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary\u00a0Issue, \u00b6\u00b653-54.\n81 CEX-6, Notice of Dispute.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 24 of 52\nfollow-up letter was sent.82 According to the Claimant, the Respondent's failure to cooperate in obtaining approval to use the Additional Facility has made the\u00a0Additional Facility unavailable.83\n70. The Claimant asserts that it could not attempt to commence arbitration proceedings\u00a0before the Additional Facility alone, as the language of the Additional Facility Rules\u00a0requires that both Parties file the application. The Claimant further alleges that not\u00a0only could it not apply for approval unilaterally, but it was also not obliged to bear\u00a0the burden of obtaining such approval since the Treaty foresees a fall-back option\u00a0which is to start proceedings under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.84\n71. According to the Claimant, in the Vannessa Ventures case the Respondent has\u00a0defended \u201calmost exactly the same position\u201d85 that the Claimant takes in this case.\u00a0The Claimant understands that in Vannessa Ventures, the Respondent argued that\n(a) The Additional Facility is not available if the SecretaryGeneral has not approved its use before the commencement\u00a0of the arbitration;\n(b) Any application for use of the Additional Facility must be\u00a0filed by \u201cthe parties\u201d (plural);\n(c) The Additional Facility Rules cannot be used if the\u00a0respondent objects to the existence of the investment\u00a0asserted by the claimant.86\nAs noted above, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent adopted the Claimant's current position in the Vannessa Ventures case.87 Moreover, the Claimant notes that\u00a0the Respondent stated in a letter sent in relation to those proceedings that this\u00a0approval should be \u201crequested by the parties.\u201d88 The Claimant therefore argues that,\u00a0under applicable international collateral estoppel theories, the Respondent should be\u00a0held to the position it took in Vannessa Ventures.89\n82 CEX-15, Letter from the Claimant to the Respondent, dated March 25, 2008.\n83 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b652-55.\n84 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b656-58; CEXL-3, Dolzer Legal Opinion, \u00b6\u00b631, 52, 59, and\u00a061.\n85 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b616.\n86 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b616.\n87 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b665-71.\n88 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b670; REX-23, Letter from Procurador\u00eda General\u00a0de la Rep\u00fablica to ICSID Secretary-General in Vannessa Ventures.\n89 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b672.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction\nApril 22, 2010\nPage 25 of 52\n72. The Claimant further contends that an application for use of the Additional Facility\u00a0had a poor prospect of success and that the Additional Facility was therefore not\u00a0available. According to the Claimant, any unilateral application for approval was\u00a0unlikely to succeed because (1) the Rules do not contemplate that an approval can\u00a0be issued when only one party requests it,90 as the Respondent correctly conceded in\u00a0the Vannessa Ventures case;91 (2) it was unclear whether the nationality requirement\u00a0would be met, given that the Respondent had been threatening to withdraw from\u00a0ICSID, and Canada was at the same time taking significant steps towards entering\u00a0ICSID;92 (3) any application for approval would significantly prejudice either the\u00a0Claimant's or the Respondent's legal position in the dispute;93 and (4) the\u00a0uncertainty arising out of the amendment to Article 4(6) of the Additional Facility\u00a0Rules in 2003 opened the door to a review of the Secretary-General's\u00a0determination.94\n73. The Claimant notes that the Respondent and its experts have argued that the\u00a0agreement concerning the existence of a dispute arising out of an investment is\u00a0already embodied in the consent to arbitration contained in the Treaty and thus\u00a0consent does not need to be given again. The Claimant rejects this argument as the\u00a0consent to arbitration in the Treaty does not meet the specific language requirements\u00a0requested by Article 4(2) of the Additional Facility Rules. Furthermore, the\u00a0Claimant notes that, in the Vannessa Ventures case, the Respondent itself confirmed\u00a0that the Treaty's consent to arbitrate is different from the additional agreement\u00a0required by the Additional Facility Rules. As stated in the Legal Opinion of Ms.\u00a0Ana Palacio, the former ICSID Secretary-General, \u201c[t]he mere existence of a BIT\u00a0consent to arbitration is not enough to make the Additional Facility available. To\u00a0this effect, further action from the parties and the Secretary-General is needed.\u201d95\n74. The Claimant contends that, when it had to decide where to initiate arbitration\u00a0proceedings, all the above-mentioned uncertainties existed. Theoretically it thus had\u00a0the option either to attempt unilaterally to apply for approval to use the Additional\u00a0Facility or immediately to resort to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration\n90 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b666.\n91 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b687-88.\n92 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b668-74.\n93 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b675-82; C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary\u00a0Issue, \u00b6\u00b689-94.\n94 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b683-86; C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary\u00a0Issue, \u00b6\u00b678-84.\n95 CEXL-29, Palacio Legal Opinion, \u00b616.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 26 of 52\nRules.96 However, the first option was not feasible for various of the abovementioned reasons. Moreover, the Claimant's duties towards its shareholders required it to take steps to preserve and exercise its rights, while at the same time\u00a0refraining from initiating procedures that had a low prospect of success.97\n75. Finally, the Claimant notes that the Respondent has avoided taking a concrete\u00a0position in this arbitration regarding when it considers the Additional Facility to be\u00a0available and has also avoided agreeing to the use of the Additional Facility, if it\u00a0were found that this dispute could not be resolved by this Tribunal.98 The Claimant\u00a0thus contends that the Respondent's goal must be to \u201chave justice denied to\u201d the\u00a0Claimant and to \u201cdelay as much as possible the resolution of this dispute.\u201d99 The\u00a0Claimant invites the Tribunal not to acquiesce to the Respondent's efforts to delay\u00a0and eventually deny justice to the Claimant, and instead confirm the valid institution\u00a0of this UNCITRAL arbitration.100\n96 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b678-86.\n97 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b695-99.\n98 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b618-20.\n99 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b623-30.\u00a0100 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b631-33.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 27 of 52\nVII. The relief sought by the Parties\nVII.1 The Respondent\n76. The Respondent requests that the Tribunal render an award as follows:\n(a) In favour of the Respondent and against the Claimant, dismissing the\u00a0Claimant's claims before it in their entirety and with prejudice in the\u00a0sense of the \u201cprevious paragraph\u201d [see paragraph 77 below]; and\n(b) Pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL\u00a0Arbitration Rules, ordering that the Claimant bear the costs of this\u00a0arbitration, including the Respondent's costs for legal representation and\u00a0assistance, including that of the Respondent's experts.101\n77. The \u201cprevious paragraph\u201d which qualifies the Respondent's request for dismissal\u00a0\u201cwith prejudice\u201d of the Claimant's case, reads as follows:\nThe Respondent's request for dismissal with prejudice is not intended to preclude a review of Claimant's case on jurisdiction and, if\u00a0necessary, on its merits before an ICSID Additional Facility tribunal. It\u00a0is likewise not intended to preclude Claimant from reinstituting this\u00a0arbitration under UNCITRAL rules in the highly unlikely event, for\u00a0example, that the ICSID Secretary-General decides not to approve the\u00a0arbitration agreement under the Additional Facility Rules. It would\u00a0only bar Claimant from reappearing before this specific Tribunal which\u00a0Venezuela maintains was improperly constituted. The Tribunal's\u00a0proper dismissal of Claimant's case would render it functus officio.102\nVII.2 The Claimant\n78. The Claimant requests that the Tribunal render an award as follows:\n(a) Confirm[ing] that the present arbitration proceedings have been validly\u00a0instituted pursuant to the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and Article\u00a0XII(4);\n(b) Dismiss[ing] all relief sought by the Respondent in connection with the\u00a0Preliminary Issue; and\n(c) Order[ing] the Respondent to pay all fees and costs related to the\u00a0Preliminary Issue.103\n101 R-5, Respondent's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6101.\n102 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6100.\n103 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6122.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 28 of 52\nVIII. Considerations of the Tribunal\n79. The Preliminary Issue for the Tribunal to decide is discrete and specific: whether on\u00a0the date on which the Claimant initiated these arbitration proceedings an alternative\u00a0procedure was \u201cavailable\u201d under the ICSID Additional Facility, within the meaning\u00a0of Article XII(4) of the Treaty. If the Tribunal finds that such option was available\u00a0to the Claimant then the Tribunal would not be entitled to exercise jurisdiction and\u00a0the Claimant would have to be redirected to the proper forum. If, however, the\u00a0Tribunal was to conclude that no alternative procedure was available under the\u00a0ICSID Additional Facility, then this Tribunal could exercise jurisdiction under\u00a0Article XII(4), subject to any other jurisdictional objections that might arise.\n80. The Respondent has objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the grounds that\u00a0the Additional Facility was available to the Claimant on October 1, 2008, since all\u00a0the jurisdictional requirements of the Additional Facility Rules were met. The\u00a0Respondent further contends that, even under the meaning of \u201cavailable\u201d that is\u00a0adopted by the Claimant, the Additional Facility was available on the date these\u00a0proceedings were initiated, since the consistent practice of the ICSID SecretaryGeneral demonstrates that the Additional Facility can be accessed with ease, as it\u00a0has been in at least two other cases under the Canada-Venezuela BIT.\n81. The Claimant disagrees and contends that neither ICSID nor the Additional Facility\u00a0were \u201cavailable\u201d within the meaning of Article XII(4) of the Treaty because they\u00a0were not \u201cready for immediate use\u201d or they did not have \u201ca reasonable prospect of\u00a0success.\u201d The Claimant argues that access to the Additional Facility depends, inter\u00a0alia, upon a joint application by the Parties and an agreement between the Parties on\u00a0the existence of an investment, neither of which was present at the time of initiation\u00a0of these proceedings, due to the Respondent's alleged failure to cooperate.\n82. In order to decide this issue, the Tribunal will begin by interpreting Article XII(4) of\u00a0the Treaty [VIII.1]. The Tribunal will then address whether the ICSID Additional\u00a0Facility was \u201cavailable,\u201d it being common ground between the Parties that\u00a0arbitration under ICSID proper was not available, since Canada is not a party to the\u00a0Washington Convention [VIII.2]; address the issue of estoppel arising in this case\u00a0[VIII.3]; and then indicate its decision [VIII.4].\nVIII.1 Interpretation of Article XII(4) of the Treaty\n83. As noted above, Article XII(4) of the Treaty provides as follows:\nThe dispute may, by the investor concerned, be submitted to arbitration under:\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction\nApril 22, 2010\nPage 29 of 52\n(a) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established pursuant to the Convention on the\u00a0Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals\u00a0of other States, opened for signature at Washington 18 March,\u00a01965 (ICSID Convention), provided that both the disputing\u00a0Contracting Party and the Contracting Party of the investor are\u00a0parties to the ICSID Convention; or\n(b) the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, provided that either the disputing Contracting Party or the Contracting Party of the\u00a0investor, but not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention; or\nIn case neither of the procedures mentioned above is available, the investor may submit the dispute to an international arbitrator or ad\u00a0hoc arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the\u00a0United Nations Commission on International Trade Law\u00a0(UNCITRAL).\n84. There is no dispute between the Parties that the interpretation of this provision is\u00a0subject to the rules set forth in the Vienna Convention and, in particular, to Articles\u00a031 to 33 thereof concerning treaty interpretation. Article 31(1) provides the starting\u00a0point:\nA treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context\u00a0and in light of its object and purpose.\n85. There is no dispute that the basic approach to the interpretation of a treaty is to have\u00a0regard to the ordinary meaning of the words chosen by its drafters, aided by a\u00a0systematic analysis of the entire agreement and teleological considerations about its\u00a0intended aim, all under an overarching principle of good faith. The Tribunal will\u00a0therefore consider the ordinary meaning of Article XII(4), in the context of the\u00a0Treaty as a whole and having regard to the Treaty's object and purpose.\nA. The structure of Article XII(4)\n86. Like most legal rules, Article XII(4) describes a factual matrix that leads to a\u00a0particular legal consequence.\n87. The factual matrix described by Article XII consists of the existence of an investor\u00a0who claims protection under the Treaty and who asserts that a dispute has arisen\u00a0against either Canada or Venezuela on the grounds that the Contracting Party has\u00a0allegedly adopted a measure which is in breach of the protections granted to the\u00a0investor by the Treaty.104 Provided that this factual matrix has arisen, Article XII\n104\n  \nSee Article XII(1) and (3) of the Treaty.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 30 of 52\u00a0describes the legal consequence\u2014the investor is granted the right to submit the\u00a0dispute to arbitration under three alternative scenarios:\n- ICSID, provided in this case that both Venezuela and Canada are parties to the 1965 Washington Convention;\n- the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either Venezuela or Canada is party to the Washington Convention; and\n- in case neither of these procedures is \u201cavailable,\u201d UNCITRAL arbitration.\n88. The purpose of Article XII(4) is to afford an investor who meets the requirements of\u00a0the Treaty the right to bring international arbitration proceedings to resolve an\u00a0investment dispute. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant's submission105 that the\u00a0proper construction of Article XII(4) must lead to the conclusion that an investor\u00a0should be able to have a right of access to one of the three prescribed arbitration\u00a0procedures. A protected investor under the Treaty enjoys a right to file international\u00a0arbitration proceedings. The question is\u2014which procedure?\n89. The ordinary meaning of Article XII(4) does not indicate that the three procedures\u00a0provided by the Treaty are to be treated as alternatives. Rather, the ordinary\u00a0meaning of Article XII(4) is to establish a hierarchy of procedures. Article XII(4)\u00a0defines access to ICSID (either under ordinary Rules or under the Additional\u00a0Facility) as the primary possibility: depending on whether only one Contracting\u00a0Party or both have ratified the Washington Convention, the investor is ipso iure\u00a0entitled to submit the dispute to the Centre under one set of rules or under the other.\n90. The possibility of filing an UNCITRAL arbitration, however, is subject to an\u00a0additional requirement: UNCITRAL arbitration is only open to an investor \u201c[i]n\u00a0case neither of the [other] procedures mentioned \u2026 is available.\u201d The wording of\u00a0Article XII(4) admits of no ambiguity or doubt. It indicates that the drafters of the\u00a0Treaty intended that it be first necessary to consider whether the dispute resolution\u00a0mechanisms of ICSID or its Additional Facility were available. Only if both were\u00a0not \u201cavailable\u201d was an investor entitled to have recourse to UNCITRAL arbitration.\n91. This conclusion arises inexorably from the ordinary meaning of Article XII(4), and\u00a0it is reinforced by the text of other BITs signed by Canada and Venezuela with other\u00a0States.\n105 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b67.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 31 of 52\n92. Canada makes use of a different form of dispute settlement clause in its other\u00a0BITs.106 For example, a number of Canada's BITs provide as follows:\nThe dispute may, at the election of the investor concerned, be submitted to arbitration under:\n(a) ICSID, established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and National of other\u00a0States, opened for signature at Washington 18 March 1965\u00a0(ICSID Convention), provided that both the disputing\u00a0Contracting Party and the Contracting Party of the investor are\u00a0parties to the Convention, or\n(b) the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, provided that either the disputing Contracting Party or the Contracting Party of the\u00a0investor, but not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention; or\n(c) an international arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration tribunal\u00a0established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations\u00a0Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). 107\nThis text makes it clear that when Canada has wanted to make arbitration under ICSID or the Additional Facility Rules or the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules equally\u00a0available at the choice of the investor, it has done so explicitly.\n93. For its part, Venezuela's BITs also indicate that when that State has wanted to make\u00a0arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules available as an alternative to\u00a0ICSID or the Additional Facility Rules without condition, then it has done so. In its\u00a0BIT with Iran, for example, Venezuela has granted the investor the following\u00a0alternatives:\nThe interested investor could refer the dispute to the competent tribunals of the receiving Contracting Party or to:\n(a)\nan ad hoc arbitral tribunal established under UNCITRAL rules, or\n(b)\nthe International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), or\n(c)\nthe International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, if both parties to the contract are members of the Convention.108\n106 R-5, Respondent's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b624.\n107 See Armenia-Canada BIT (Article XIII(4)), Barbados-Canada BIT (Article XIII(4)), Canada-Croatia BIT\n(Article XII(4)), Canada-Ecuador BIT (Article XIII(4)), Canada-Egypt BIT (Article XIII(4)) Canada-El Salvador BIT (Article XII), Canada-Latvia BIT (Article XIII(4)), Canada-Lebanon BIT (Article XII(4)),\u00a0Canada-Panama BIT (Article XIII(4)), Canada-Philippines BIT (Article XIII(4)), Canada-Romania BIT (Article\u00a0XIII(4)), Canada-South Africa BIT (Article XIII(4)), Canada-Thailand BIT (Article XIII(4)), Canada-Trinidad\u00a0and Tobago BIT (Article XIII(4)), Canada-Ukraine BIT (Article XIII(4)), and Canada-Uruguay BIT (Article\u00a0XII(4)), available online at: http://www.unctadxi.org/templates/DocSearch.aspx?id=779 (emphasis added).\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 32 of 52\n94. Similarly, the Italy-Venezuela BIT provides:\nIn the case of international arbitration, the dispute shall be submitted \u2026 to any of the following institutions:\n(a) To the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) \u2026 when each State party in the present\u00a0agreement is a party to [the Convention]. When that condition is\u00a0not fulfilled, each Contracting Party gives its consent for the\u00a0submission of the controversy to the ICSID Additional Facility.\n(b) To an ad hoc arbitral tribunal established \u2026 according to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on\u00a0International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).109\n95. These BITs entered into by Canada and Venezuela include language that allows the\u00a0investor to select the arbitration system it prefers\u2014including arbitration under the\u00a0UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, if it so wishes. A simple comparison between the\u00a0wording used in these BITs and the wording adopted in the Canada-Venezuela BIT\u00a0shows that Canada and Venezuela decided to adopt a different approach in the case\u00a0of the latter Treaty, namely one that establishes a hierarchy of choices depending\u00a0upon what is available. ICSID or the Additional Facility Rules are adopted as the\u00a0primary dispute resolution mechanism, and the Treaty only authorizes access to\u00a0UNCITRAL if ICSID or the Additional Facility Rules are not available. In the\u00a0Canada-Venezuela BIT, the investor has no right to initiate proceedings under the\u00a0UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules if arbitration under ICSID or the Additional Facility\u00a0Rules is available. In such circumstances, the investor must initiate whichever\u00a0ICSID procedure is applicable.\nB. The meaning of \u201cavailable\u201d\n96. In the present case, therefore, the crucial issue is whether arbitration under ICSID or\u00a0the Additional Facility Rules was available as at October 1, 2008. What does\u00a0\u201cavailable\u201d mean?\n97. The Treaty does not provide any guidance. The Parties have extensively and\u00a0helpfully addressed this issue, in respect of which their disagreement is acute. The\u00a0Claimant submits that \u201cavailable\u201d means \u201cpresent or ready for immediate use,\u201d110\n108 REX-13, Ley Aprobatoria del Acuerdo sobre la Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n Rec\u00edproca de Inversiones entre el\u00a0Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela y el Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Isl\u00e1mica de Ir\u00e1n, signed on\u00a0January 12, 2006, Article 11 (emphasis added).\n109 REX-14, Acuerdo entre el Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Italiana y el Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica de Venezuela\u00a0sobre Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n de las Inversiones, signed on June 4, 1990, Article 8(5) (emphasis added).\n110 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b621, relying on the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary,\u00a011th ed.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\nPage 33 of 52\nand with a reasonable prospect of success in the endeavour.111 The Respondent adopts a definition that indicates that ICSID proper or the ICSID Additional Facility\u00a0will be \u201cavailable\u201d if they are capable of being used or accessed,112 and does not\u00a0accept that any requirement as to the prospect of success is to be read into the\u00a0definition.113\n98. In order to clarify this issue, the Tribunal finds that it is appropriate to consider not\u00a0only the English language version of the Treaty, but also the Spanish and French\u00a0texts, since each of these texts is equally authentic. The Spanish version of Article\u00a0XII(4) closely follows the English text, stating as follows:\nEn caso de que ninguno de los procedimientos mencionados anteriormente est\u00e9 disponible, el inversor podr\u00e1 someter la disputa [a\u00a0arbitraje CNUDMI].\n99. The French text, however, adopts a slightly different approach:\nLorsque aucun des recours susmentionn\u00e9s ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9, l'investisseur peut soumettre le diff\u00e9rend \u00e0 [l'arbitrage CNUDCI].\n100. Comparing these three texts of Article XII(4), the Tribunal notes that the French\u00a0text might be considered to be more precise, in the sense that it explicitly identifies\u00a0three considerations, aspects of which may only be implicitly articulated in the\u00a0Spanish and English versions:\n- availability relates to the \u201cexercise,\u201d i.e., the ability to implement or to avail oneself of (\u201cpeut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9\u201d) the ICSID or ICSID Additional\u00a0Facility procedures;\n- a relevant qualifying factor is the possibility of the \u201cexercise\u201d of the action (\u201cpeut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9\u201d), not the actual success; and\n- that it is the investor who must be unable to \u201cexercise\u201d ICSID arbitration, since it is the investor who, in the absence of access to\u00a0ICSID, has the option to submit the dispute to UNCITRAL arbitration.\n101. The French text suggests that Article XII(4) is properly to be interpreted as\u00a0indicating that the burden is on the Claimant to establish that, at the time when it\u00a0filed its Request for Arbitration, no possibility existed for it to exercise a right to\n111 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b626.\n112 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b619, relying on the Reinisch Legal Opinion.\n113 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b626.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 34 of 52\nbring an arbitration, either under the ICSID Rules proper or under the Additional Facility Rules:\n(i) Possibility: Article XII(4) cannot be interpreted as requiring a\u00a0prospective claimant to bring proceedings under ICSID or the Additional\u00a0Facility Rules, if the prospects of approval (if necessary) and registration\u00a0are non-existent or unlikely, or will require an unreasonable effort.\n(ii) To exercise: When is an investor able \u201cto exercise\u201d an ICSID arbitration\u00a0procedure? Access to ICSID arbitration requires, as a preliminary step,\u00a0that certain administrative hurdles be overcome. In the case of arbitration\u00a0under ordinary ICSID rules, the request must be drafted and\u00a0communicated to the Secretary-General of ICSID, who will then decide\u00a0whether or not to register it.114 In the case of ICSID Additional Facility\u00a0Rules, the Secretary-General must decide on whether to give his or her\u00a0approval to an agreement to arbitrate, and then decide on whether to\u00a0register the request.115 Until these requirements have been met, an ICSID\u00a0or ICSID Additional Facility tribunal cannot be constituted and will have\u00a0no capacity to decide on possible jurisdictional objections and on the\u00a0merits of the dispute.\n102. In sum, the Tribunal proceeds on the basis that for the purposes of Article XII(4) of\u00a0the Treaty, arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules will not be \u201cavailable\u201d if\u00a0there is no reasonable prospect that the Secretary-General would approve the\u00a0arbitration agreement and then register a request for arbitration, and would do so in\u00a0a timely manner.\nVIII.2 Availability of the Additional Facility\n103. Under the Washington Convention it is clear that the jurisdiction of ICSID is limited\u00a0to disputes arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State and a\u00a0national of another Contracting State.116 In 1978, the ICSID Administrative Council\u00a0decided to authorize the Centre to administer certain proceedings between States\u00a0and nationals of other States that might otherwise fall outside the scope of the\u00a0Washington Convention. These procedures, which include arbitrations between\n114 See Article 36(3), Washington Convention.\n115 See Article 4(2), ICSID Additional Facility Rules.\n116 See Article 25(1), Washington Convention.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\nPage 35 of 52 parties at least one of which is either a Contracting State or a national of a\u00a0Contracting State, are governed by the Additional Facility Rules (as last amended\u00a0by the Administrative Council on April 10, 2006). These Rules comprise a number\u00a0of general principles (the Additional Facility Rules), plus three schedules, of which\u00a0Schedule C provides specific rules for arbitration proceedings.\nA. Facts\n104. As a preliminary step, it is necessary to summarize the underlying facts. On\u00a0February 8, 2008, the Claimant sent a Notice of Dispute to the Respondent, in which\u00a0the investor \u201caccept[ed] the offer made by [Venezuela] in Treaty Article XII(4) to\u00a0have the Dispute resolved in an international arbitration (including, as available on\u00a0the date of submission of the arbitration request, arbitration under [ICSID], [ICSID\u00a0Additional Facility] and arbitration under the [UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules].\u201d117\u00a0The Claimant sent a follow up letter on March 25, 2008.118 There is nothing in the\u00a0record to indicate whether the Respondent replied to these communications,\u00a0although in the Tribunal's view nothing turns on that. On October 1, 2008 the\u00a0Claimant sent the Respondent a Notice of Arbitration under UNCITRAL\u00a0Arbitration Rules, which has given rise to the present procedure.119 There is nothing\u00a0in the record to indicate whether the Claimant, before submitting its Notice of\u00a0Arbitration in these proceedings, approached ICSID to enquire whether the Centre\u00a0would be prepared to administer the arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules.\u00a0We assume that if the Claimant had made such an approach, and if such an\u00a0approach had indicated that arbitration was not \u201cavailable\u201d pursuant to the\u00a0Additional Facility Rules, then the Claimant would have so informed the Tribunal.\nB. Was the ICSID Additional Facility \u201cavailable\u201d to the Claimant on October 1, 2008?\n105. There is no dispute between the Parties that, on October 1, 2008, Venezuela was a\u00a0party to the ICSID Convention, but that Canada was not. Accordingly, as already\u00a0previously noted, the only type of ICSID arbitration which might conceivably have\u00a0been available to the Claimant would have been ICSID arbitration under the\u00a0Additional Facility Rules. To determine whether arbitration under the ICSID\u00a0Additional Facility Rules was \u201cavailable\u201d on October 1, 2008, it is necessary:\n(i) to consider whether the claim is covered by one or both categories of\n117 CEX-6, Notice of Dispute.\n118 CEX-15, Letter from the Claimant to the Respondent, dated March 25, 2008.\n119 CEX-7, Notice of Arbitration.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 36 of 52\nclaims that may be filed under the Additional Facility Rules;\n(ii) to identify the requirements that must be met for arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules to be \u201cavailable\u201d;\n(iii) to determine the circumstances in which the Centre can deny access to\u00a0arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules; and\n(iv) to apply these considerations to the facts of this case.\n(i) Types of applications to access the ICSID Additional Facility\n106. Under the Additional Facility Rules, the Centre is authorized to administer\u00a0proceedings between a State and a national of another State in two categories of\u00a0circumstances:\n1. proceedings for the settlement of legal disputes arising directly out of an investment, which are not within the jurisdiction of the Centre because\u00a0either the State party to the dispute (in this case, Venezuela) or the State\u00a0of the investor (in this case, Canada) is not a Contracting State under the\u00a0Washington Convention (Article 2(a) of the Additional Facility Rules);\u00a0this category refers to investment disputes arising in connection with\u00a0alleged violations of BITs; and\n2. proceedings for the settlement of legal disputes which are not within the jurisdiction of the Centre because they do not arise directly out of an\u00a0investment (provided again that either the State party to the dispute or\u00a0the State of the counterparty has adopted the Washington Convention)\u00a0(Article 2(b) of the Additional Facility Rules); this type of dispute\u00a0includes contractual claims arising from agreements signed between a\u00a0State (or one of its divisions) and a foreign national.\n107. In this case the Claimant alleges that it has a protected investment in Venezuela and\u00a0that the Respondent has violated certain obligations assumed in the Treaty. The\u00a0dispute thus constitutes an investment dispute, which, if it is to be submitted to the\u00a0Additional Facility, can only be presented under Article 2(a) of the Additional\u00a0Facility Rules. The claim cannot sustain a request for arbitration under Article 2(b)\u00a0of the Additional Facility Rules because, in the way it has been formulated, it\u00a0cannot meet the requirements of that article. It is a dispute connected to an\u00a0investment.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction\nApril 22, 2010\nPage 37 of 52\n(ii) Requirements for each type of application\n108. For a claimant to be able to obtain access to arbitration under Article 2(a) of the\u00a0Additional Facility Rules, it is necessary that two requirements be met:\n(a) the Secretary-General of ICSID must be in a position to give approval under Article 4(2) of the Additional Facility Rules; and\n(b) the Secretary-General must then be in a position to register the request for arbitration under Article 4 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility)\u00a0Rules.\nOnce these two administrative conditions have been met, the arbitration formally starts with the initiation of the procedure for the designation of the Tribunal.\n(a) Approval by the Secretary-General\n109. The necessity of approval by the Secretary-General is foreseen by Article 4(1) of the\u00a0Additional Facility Rules:\nAny agreement providing for conciliation or arbitration proceedings under the Additional Facility in respect of existing or\u00a0future disputes requires the approval of the Secretary-General.\n110. The requirements for the granting of approval are developed in the second\u00a0paragraph of Article 4 of the Additional Facility Rules: the Secretary-General can\u00a0give approval to an application based on Article 2 (a) \u201conly \u2026 if [she] is satisfied\u00a0that the requirements of that provision are fulfilled at the time.\u201d120 Article 2(a) of the\u00a0Additional Facility Rules sets forth two requirements: first, that the dispute is a legal\u00a0dispute, and second that it arises directly out of an investment. If these two\u00a0requirements are met,121 the Secretary-General has no discretion: under the\u00a0Additional Facility Rules she \u201cshall\u201d approve the procedure.\n111. As regards the timing of the request for approval, Article 4(1) of the Additional\u00a0Facility Rules is clear: the application may be submitted \u201cin respect of existing or\u00a0future disputes \u2026 at any time prior to the institution of proceedings.\u201d The\n120 Article 4(2) further requires that \u201cboth parties [must] give their consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre under\u00a0Article 25 of the [Washington] Convention (in lieu of the Additional Facility) in the event that the jurisdictional\u00a0requirements ratione personae of that Article shall have been met at the time when proceedings are instituted.\u201d\u00a0This clause of the Additional Facility Rules regulates a situation that has no bearing on this case: the possibility\u00a0that between authorization and institution of the procedure, the second State, which was not a party to the\u00a0Washington Convention, becomes a party to this Treaty; in such case the consent requirement of Article 25 of\u00a0the Convention becomes applicable; since Canada is not a Contracting Party to the Washington Convention, this\u00a0second requirement is moot.\n121 Moreover, the ratione personae requirements which, in this case, are not disputed.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 38 of 52\nSecretary-General must then take her decision \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d (Article 4(5) of the Additional Facility Rules).\n112. An issue which has been addressed in some detail by the Parties is whether the\u00a0application for approval must be made jointly by the Parties, or whether it is\u00a0sufficient for it to be made by the investor alone, acting unilaterally. The Claimant\u00a0submits that Article 4(1) requires a joint application by investor and State, and that\u00a0it cannot therefore bring arbitration proceedings under the Additional Facility Rules\u00a0without the cooperation of Venezuela which, it claims, has not been forthcoming.122\u00a0The Claimant's argument is based on a rather literal reading of Article 4(1) of the\u00a0Additional Facility Rules, which states that \u201cthe parties may apply for such\u00a0approval.\u201d In the Claimant's opinion, this wording requires that both Parties must\u00a0jointly apply for approval.\n113. The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's interpretation. It submits that, by\u00a0signing the Treaty, the Respondent had, well before October 1, 2008, agreed to\u00a0ICSID Additional Facility arbitration, and that the Request for Arbitration and for\u00a0approval could be presented by the investor acting on its own.123\n114. The Respondent has presented extensive evidence to support its assertion that in\u00a0practice, applications for approval are invariably presented by the investor alone,\u00a0without participation of a respondent State. This evidence, which has not been\u00a0contradicted by the Claimant, includes a Legal Opinion signed by Barton Legum, a\u00a0partner of the law firm Salans LLP, who has acted as counsel in a number of\u00a0Additional Facility arbitrations. The relevant part of Mr. Legum's statement is more\u00a0in the nature of a statement of fact tendered by a witness, in the sense that he attests\u00a0to his own experience. He declares that:\nNo additional act by the respondent has been required or even solicited by ICSID before the case was registered by ICSID in any of\u00a0the cases I have personally handled, including Mobil, Loewen,\n122 C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b636; C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary\u00a0Issue, \u00b689.\n123 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b642. On December 16, 2009 the Respondent\u00a0submitted a request to the Secretary-General of ICSID, asking for clarification as to whether \u201cunder the\u00a0Additional Facility Rules \u2026 a joint application by the Claimant and the State Respondent [is] necessary in order\u00a0for ICSID to approve the application.\u201d (CEX-30, Letter from the Respondent to the ICSID Secretary-General).\u00a0The letter, although written by the Respondent, was submitted by the Claimant. The Secretary-General's\u00a0response was somewhat delphic, because she answered that under Article 2(2) of the Arbitration (Additional\u00a0Facility) Rules the request for arbitration may be made jointly by the parties (with the implication that it can also\u00a0be made individually). In fact, the question submitted by the Respondent was different, because it referred to a\u00a0previous and separate step, the application for approval, and asked whether this application (and not the request\u00a0for arbitration) could be filed individually by the claimant.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 39 of 52\nMondev and ADF, or in any of the cases against Mexico that I closely followed while at the Department of State.124\n115. There is further material before the Tribunal that is even more pertinent to the\u00a0present proceedings, namely information concerning an Additional Facility\u00a0arbitration between a different Canadian investor and the Respondent that is also\u00a0based on Article XII(4) of the Canada-Venezuela BIT\u2014namely Vannessa Ventures\u00a0Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. That arbitration was initiated on July 8,\u00a02004 under the Additional Facility Rules, by the Canadian company, acting\u00a0unilaterally. The application sought approval from the Secretary-General of ICSID\u00a0under Article 4(2) of the Additional Facility Rules.125 Within four months of the\u00a0application, and notwithstanding Venezuela's objection,126 on October 28, 2004 the\u00a0Secretary-General granted approval and registered the procedure.127\n116. The arguments before the Tribunal, as supported by the relevant materials, point\u00a0decisively in one direction, allowing the Tribunal to conclude that it is well\u00a0established in ICSID practice for the Secretary-General, acting under Articles 4(1)\u00a0and 4(2) of the Additional Facility Rules, to approve an arbitration agreement upon\u00a0the application of an investor claimant acting without the support of the respondent\u00a0State. ICSID practice has consistently construed Article 4(1) of the Additional\u00a0Facility Rules, which requires that \u201c[t]he parties may apply for [the] approval,\u201d in\u00a0the sense that an application by any one of the parties alone will be sufficient. There\u00a0is no evidence before the Tribunal to indicate that ICSID has required a request for\u00a0approval under Articles 4(1) and 4(2) to be made jointly by an investor and a State.\u00a0The rationale for this appears to be that the entry into force of a BIT containing an\u00a0express submission to arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules\u00a0constitutes an acceptance of the possibility of such arbitration by both parties.\n117. There is an additional argument: the above conclusion is consistent with the\u00a0Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, which clearly envisage and allow requests\u00a0initiating arbitration proceedings under the Additional Facility Rules to be\u00a0submitted at the instance of the claimant alone.\n124 Legum Legal Opinion, \u00b624.\n125 REX-21, Letter from John Terry, Counsel for Vannessa Ventures Ltd., to ICSID Secretary-General, dated\u00a0July 8, 2004.\n126 Which is the subject of further analysis, see \u00b6\u00b6138-146 below.\n127 See REXL-23, Decision on Jurisdiction, dated August 22, 2008.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\nPage 40 of 52\n(b) Registration of the request\n118. The second requirement with which an investor must comply, in order to have\u00a0access to an Additional Facility arbitration, is to submit a written request of\u00a0arbitration to the Secretariat.128 The request is in the form of a simple document that\u00a0identifies the parties, describes the agreement to arbitrate, and provides an\u00a0indication of the issues in dispute and the financial amount involved.129 A similar\u00a0document is also needed at the outset of arbitrations under ordinary ICSID Rules.130\n119. The Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules make it clear that under the Additional\u00a0Facility Rules, requests for the registration of an arbitration may be made\u00a0individually by an investor, without any need for the participation of the respondent\u00a0State.131\n120. Once submitted by the investor claimant, the request must be approved by the\u00a0Secretary-General if she \u201cha[s] satisfied [her]self that the request conforms in form\u00a0and substance\u201d with the requirements set forth in the Additional Facility Rules .132\n121. In practice, claimants frequently join the application for approval and the request for\u00a0arbitration into a single document, which is then submitted to ICSID's Secretary-General.133 That is what happened in the Vannessa Ventures case, where the\u00a0claimant's initial letter dated July 8, 2004 included requests for approval and\u00a0registration.134 ICSID approved both applications in a single decision dated October\u00a028, 2004.\n122. Once the Secretary-General of ICSID has registered the request, and the final\u00a0administrative hurdle has been overcome, the arbitration proceedings are formally\u00a0initiated and the process for the constitution of the Tribunal is triggerred. The\u00a0arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules are set in motion,\u00a0and the availability of the procedure is finally confirmed.\n128 Article 2(1), Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.\n129 Article 3(1), Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.\n130 See Article 36(2), Washington Convention; access to ordinary ICSID arbitration is not subject to\u00a0authorization from the Secretary-General, but does require registration of the request.\n131 See Article 2(2), Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules a contrario sensu.\n132 Article 4, Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.\n133 Legum Legal Opinion, \u00b620.\n134 REX-21, Letter from John Terry, Counsel for Vannessa Ventures Ltd., to ICSID Secretary-General, dated\u00a0July 8, 2004.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\nPage 41 of 52\n123. Against this background, the Tribunal finds that the requirements with which a\u00a0claimant must comply in order to access Additional Facility arbitration consist of an\u00a0application for authorization addressed to the Secretary-General of the Centre and a\u00a0request for registration of the dispute. The application for authorization and the\u00a0request for registration may be joined in a single document, which in the Vannessa\u00a0Ventures case did not exceed two pages in length. No evidence has been put forward\u00a0by the Claimant in this case to suggest that ICSID admits of any unnecessary delay\u00a0in dealing with the authorization and registration procedures. In Vannessa Ventures,\u00a0despite the fact that the Respondent presented objections that were supported by\u00a0detailed argument, the case was registered by the ICSID Secretary-General in less\u00a0than four months from the date the requests were made.\n124. The Tribunal has already found that the Additional Facility is \u201cavailable\u201d within the\u00a0meaning of Article XII(4) of the Treaty, as long as there is a reasonable prospect\u00a0that the Secretary-General would approve the arbitration agreement and then\u00a0register the request for arbitration, and would do so in a timely manner. What\u00a0remains to be determined is whether the ICSID Secretariat, in the event that the\u00a0Claimant had made such an application here, would have decided not to register the\u00a0case.\n(iii) Denial of access to the Additional Facility\n125. The members of the Tribunal are conscious that it is not for this Tribunal to\u00a0determine whether or not the ICSID Secretary-General would register the case\u00a0under the Additional Facility Rules. That is a matter for the ICSID SecretaryGeneral alone, and the Tribunal wishes to make clear that it does not in any way\u00a0prejudge her exercise of powers at ICSID. That said, in order for the Tribunal to\u00a0determine whether arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules is or is not\u00a0\u201cavailable\u201d for the purposes of the exercise of its jurisdiction in these proceedings,\u00a0the Tribunal does need to form a view as to the likelihood that the ICSID SecretaryGeneral would register an application in relation to this Treaty and a request for\u00a0arbitration proceedings.\n126. The Respondent submits that approval by the ICSID Secretary-General and\u00a0registration of the request is straightforward and easily available to those who apply\u00a0for it. The Respondent submits that in at least 26 published cases, applications by a\u00a0claimant under the Additional Facility Rules have been approved and registered.135\u00a0Moreover, the Respondent has adopted as legal submission the views expressed by\n135 R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b654.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 42 of 52\nMr. Legum in his Legal Opinion, asserting that he is not aware of any case in which ICSID has refused a request for approval concerning an existing dispute on the\u00a0ground that it did not meet the requirements of Article 2 of the Additional Facility\u00a0Rules.136 These two submissions have not been challenged by the Claimant; it has\u00a0also not disputed that in the Vannessa Ventures case under the Canada-Venezuela\u00a0BIT, approval for arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules was duly granted\u00a0and the request registered.\n127. On the basis of these considerations, the Claimant's prospects of success in\u00a0invoking arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules may not, on their face, be\u00a0said to be unlikely. Nevertheless, as both Parties agree, these decisions of the ICSID\u00a0Secretary-General are not binding precedent; provided that she conforms to the\u00a0Additional Facility Rules the theoretical possibility exists that the Secretary-General\u00a0could decide to deviate from the approach taken in previous decisions.137 On the\u00a0basis of the facts in this case, therefore, is there any basis for considering that the\u00a0ICSID Secretary-General might adopt a different approach in this case from that\u00a0taken in the Vannessa Ventures case?\n128. The Claimant has not put forward any evidence as to facts, or invoked any legal\u00a0arguments, that would permit the Tribunal to conclude that there is any real prospect\u00a0that the Secretary-General of ICSID might adopt a different approach from that\u00a0taken in Vannessa Ventures.\n129. Out of an abundance of caution, the Tribunal has nevertheless turned its mind to two\u00a0possibilities that might, theoretically, be relied upon by the Secretary-General of\u00a0ICSID to adopt a different approach in this case.\n(a) Does the dispute arise directly out of an investment?\n130. The first consideration concerns the requirement of Article 2(a) of the Additional\u00a0Facility Rules that a dispute can only be submitted to the Additional Facility if it\u00a0arises directly out of an investment. In its Notice of Dispute, the Claimant has\u00a0asserted that its investments in Venezuela include the following:\n(i) A Coal Supply Agreement of March 18th, 2005, between\u00a0the Investor and Guasare Coal International N.V. (\u201cGuasare\u201d), an\u00a0enterprise ultimately controlled by the Government of Venezuela (the\u00a0\u201cGOVE\u201d), along with confirmation letters, transactions, and related\u00a0documents (together, the \u201cCSA\u201d);\n136 Legum Legal Opinion, \u00b630.\n137 See C-7, Claimant's Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b634; R-12, Respondent's Reply Brief on the Preliminary\u00a0Issue, \u00b640. See also CEXL-29, Palacio Legal Opinion, \u00b617.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction\nApril 22, 2010\nPage 43 of 52\n(ii) The capital committed by the Investor, as payments under\u00a0the CSA, for the development of the Venezuelan economy in general\u00a0and its mining industry in particular; and\n(iii) The Investor's claims to performance under the CSA, as\u00a0well as its claims to performance of GOVE's various undertakings vis-\u00e0-vis the Investor, including the Investor's claims to the delivery of\u00a0coal extracted from Venezuelan mines and owed by the GOVE to the\u00a0Investor.138\n131. In taking any decision to approve the arbitration, the ICSID Secretary-General\u00a0would have to \u201cgive [her] approval only if [she] is satisfied\u201d that the dispute arises\u00a0directly out of an investment (see Article 4(2) of the Additional Facility Rules).\u00a0Consequently, if the Secretary-General was not satisfied that the Claimant was the\u00a0owner of a protected investment located in Venezuela, she would not be able to give\u00a0her approval.\n132. Would there be any basis for the Claimant to expect that the Secretary-General\u00a0might have rejected in October 2008 a request for approval, on the basis that the\u00a0dispute did not arise directly out of an investment? The Tribunal sees no reasonable\u00a0basis for such a view.\n133. The Tribunal reaches this conclusion initially on the grounds that the Claimant has\u00a0not been able to show a single case in which the Secretary-General has refused\u00a0approval for access to the Additional Facility, for this or any other reason. The\u00a0absence of any evidence in that direction could indicate that the Secretary-General\u00a0only rejects a request for approval if she finds that the dispute is manifestly outside\u00a0the scope of the Additional Facility (applying by analogy the criterion established in\u00a0Article 36(3) of the Washington Convention for denying registration in ordinary\u00a0ICSID arbitration), and allows all other cases to be decided by the arbitrators, as a\u00a0matter of admissibility or jurisdiction.139 It is difficult to see on what basis it could\u00a0be said that this dispute is manifestly outside the scope of the Additional Facility\u00a0such as to lead to the conclusion that a request to register would be rejected.\n138 CEX-6, Notice of Dispute.\n139 An indication in favour of this interpretation can be deduced from an amendment introduced on January 1,\u00a02003 to Article 4(6) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. Since then, the approval of the SecretaryGeneral has not been conclusive and can be reviewed by an Arbitral Tribunal. The issue, however, is not\u00a0entirely clear as the text of Article 4 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules differs to that of Article 36(3)\u00a0of the Washington Convention. Based on this difference, former Secretary-General Palacio stated in her legal\u00a0opinion that the \u201cmanifestly\u201d test is only applicable in ordinary ICSID arbitration, but not in the Additional\u00a0Facility: CEXL-29, Palacio Legal Opinion.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 44 of 52\n134. There is an additional and more specific factor that leads the Tribunal to the same\u00a0conclusion. Article 1(f) of the Canada-Venezuela BIT provides a broad definition of\u00a0\u201cinvestment\u201d:\n(f) \u201cinvestment\u201d means any kind of asset owned or controlled by an investor of one Contracting Party either directly or indirectly,\u00a0including through an investor of a third State, in the territory of\u00a0the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter's laws.\u00a0In particular, though not exclusively, \u201cinvestment\u201d includes:\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0movable and immovable property and any related property\nrights, such as mortgages, liens or pledges;\n(ii) shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any other form of\u00a0participation in a company, business enterprise or joint\u00a0venture;\n(iii) money, claims to money, and claims to performance under\u00a0contract having a financial value;\n(iv) goodwill;\n(v) intellectual property rights;\n(vi) rights, conferred by law or under contract, to undertake\nany economic and commercial activity, including any rights to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural\u00a0resources;\nbut does not mean real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, not acquired in the expectation or used for the\u00a0purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes.\nAny change in the form of an investment does not affect its character as an investment.\n135. This broad definition, which would be taken into account by the ICSID SecretaryGeneral in reaching her decision, reduces or eliminates the prospect that at the\u00a0initial phase of approval the Secretary-General might deny the Claimant access to\u00a0arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules.\n136. The Claimant acknowledges that it did not approach the ICSID secretariat to\u00a0ascertain the prospects of success of a request for approval of the arbitration\u00a0agreement and registration of the request for arbitration under the Additional\u00a0Facility Rules. If the Claimant had taken that step, and received an indication that\u00a0the request might in some way not meet the conditions for approval and registration,\u00a0then the considerations which frame the Tribunal's conclusions may have been\u00a0different. That is not, however, the situation.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\u00a0Page 45 of 52\n137. In summary, the Tribunal concludes that on October 1, 2008, the date on which the\u00a0Claimant initiated these arbitration proceedings under the UNCITRAL Arbitration\u00a0Rules, arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules could have been\u00a0\u201cavailable\u201d to the Claimant within the meaning of Article XII(4) of the BIT. There\u00a0was no bar to the Claimant submitting an application for approval to the SecretaryGeneral of ICSID, and there is no basis upon which the Claimant could reasonably\u00a0conclude that approval and registration would not have been forthcoming in a\u00a0timely manner.\nVIII.3 Estoppel\n138. The Claimant has made a further argument that requires the Tribunal's attention.140\u00a0It notes that the Respondent took a position in the Vannessa Ventures case that was\u00a0the opposite of that which it is now putting forward in this arbitration, namely that\u00a0in an Additional Facility arbitration a request for approval of an arbitration\u00a0agreement must be presented jointly by both parties, with the consequence that the\u00a0Additional Facility will not be \u201cavailable\u201d if the respondent State raises an\u00a0objection, for example on the grounds that the dispute did not arise out of an\u00a0\u201cinvestment.\u201d The Claimant submits that \u201ca man shall not be allowed to blow hot\u00a0and cold,\u201d141 and that the Tribunal should hold Venezuela to the position it adopted\u00a0in argument in the Vannessa Ventures case.\n139. The request for approval and registration in the Vannessa Ventures case was\u00a0submitted to ICSID on July 8, 2004.142 Upon receipt of the submission, the ICSID\u00a0Secretary-General gave Venezuela the possibility to submit observations, which\u00a0Venezuela did by a letter from its Attorney-General, dated August 23, 2004.143\u00a0Venezuela asserted that Vannessa Ventures Ltd. should be denied access to the\u00a0Additional Facility and its request for arbitration be rejected.144 The reasons\u00a0included, inter alia, the fact that the BIT had not been approved by the Secretary-General,145 and that approval had to be requested jointly by both parties.146\n140 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b6\u00b665-72.\n141 C-11, Claimant's Rejoinder Brief on the Preliminary Issue, \u00b672.\n142 REX-21, Letter from John Terry, Counsel for Vannessa Ventures Ltd., to ICSID Secretary-General, dated\u00a0July 8, 2004.\n143 REX-23, Decision on Jurisdiction, dated August 22, 2008.\n144 REX-23, Decision on Jurisdiction, dated August 22, 2008, p. 21.\n145 REX-23, Decision on Jurisdiction, dated August 22, 2008, pp. 8-9.\n146 REX-23, Decision on Jurisdiction, dated August 22, 2008, p. 6: \u201cDicho Acuerdo [i.e. the BIT], no s\u00f3lo no ha\u00a0sido aprobado por la Secretar\u00eda General del [CIADI], tal y como lo exige [el art\u00edculo 4 (1) of the Additional\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction April 22, 2010\nPage 46 of 52\n140. There is no doubt that the arguments presented in 2004 by Venezuela in that case\u00a0contradict the position that Venezuela adopts in this arbitration. Is the Respondent\u00a0estopped from adopting this new position, as the Claimant asserts?\n141. The existence of a doctrine of estoppel, or the prohibition of venire contra factum\u00a0proprium, is well established in public international law, even if its existence as a\u00a0general principle of law or a rule of customary international law remains open to\u00a0debate.147 The consensus further covers the origin of the doctrine, which in public\u00a0international law may be seen as being connected to the principle of good faith.148\u00a0Its applicability has long been recognized in investment arbitration.149 The precise\u00a0scope of the doctrine remains subject to considerable debate. Notwithstanding this\u00a0discussion, there is general agreement that the doctrine can be applied to the\u00a0behaviour of States in judicial or arbitral proceedings. In these situations, if there is\u00a0an inconsistency between a State's present claims or allegations and its previous\u00a0conduct, such divergence violates the principle of good faith, to which all the State's\u00a0action must submit, and more specifically the prohibition of venire contra factum\u00a0proprium. Consequently, the State should be estopped from adopting this new\u00a0stance.150\n142. The Tribunal sees no reason to enter into the details of this debate, however\u00a0interesting or important it may be. At the heart of the principle of estoppel, even\u00a0assuming it to be applicable, is the notion that one party is prevented from asserting a\u00a0new position that contradicts an earlier position on which the other party has relied.\u00a0As the International Court of Justice has put it, estoppel in international law requires:\nFacility Rules], sino que no hay evidencia de que tal aprobaci\u00f3n haya sido solicitada por las partes, para cumplir con la exigencia prevista en la norma in comento.\u201d\n147 See I.

Cottier and J-P M\u00fcller, \u201cEstoppel\u201d in Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (2007),\u00a0\u00b6\u00b69-10, online: Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law\u00a0<http://www.mpepil.com>.\n148 Gulf of Maine (Canada v. U.S.), [1984] I.C.J Rep. 246 at 305 (\u201cthe concepts of acquiescence and estoppel,\u00a0\u2026 both follow from the fundamental principles of good faith and equity.\u201d)\n149 Amco Asia Corp. v.

In addition, the Tribunal considers that, in particular for the applications in international\u00a0relations, the whole concept is characterized by the requirement of good faith.\u201d).\n150 Judge Alfaro in his separate opinion in Temple of Preah Vihear referred to estoppel in international law as an\u00a0\u201cinconsistency between claims or allegations put forward by a State, and its previous conduct in connection\u00a0therewith, is not admissible\u201d: Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand), [1962] I.C.J. Rep. 6 at 39-51\u00a0(Separate Opinion of Vice President Alfaro), \u00b640.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction\nApril 22, 2010\nPage 47 of 52\na statement or representation made by one party to another and reliance upon it by that other party to his detriment or to the advantage\u00a0of the party making it.151\n143. In other words, it is not sufficient that one party has engaged in inconsistent\u00a0conduct. It is also necessary to establish that the counterparty was aware of that\u00a0conduct, relied on it, and acted on the assumption that the first party would not\u00a0deviate from that original position.152 In the present case, the Claimant cannot\u00a0credibly assert that it relied on the Respondent's legal argument made in another\u00a0case involving another party, and which was unambiguously rejected by the\u00a0Secretary-General of ICSID. Moreover, the evidence indicates that, on October 1,\u00a02008, when the Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration under the UNCITRAL\u00a0Arbitration Rules, without any previous approach or consultation with ICSID,153 it\u00a0could not have been aware of the detailed arguments presented by Venezuela in the\u00a0Vannessa Ventures case, as the contents of Venezuela's letter of August 23, 2004\u00a0were only disclosed to the Claimant when Venezuela filed a copy of the letter in\u00a0these proceedings.154 It is therefore difficult to see on what basis the Claimant's\u00a0decision to start UNCITRAL proceedings in October 2008 might be said to have\u00a0been influenced by arguments made in another proceeding of which the Claimant\u00a0had no knowledge.\n144. The change of position adopted by Venezuela is consistent with the decision of the\u00a0ICSID Secretary-General. If Venezuela had maintained its previous argument, it\u00a0would have done so in the knowledge that it would be bound once again to fail.\u00a0Were the Tribunal to adopt the position advocated by the Claimant, it would in\u00a0effect be punishing Venezuela for adopting the reasonable position of taking into\u00a0account the bases of the decision of the ICSID Secretary-General.\n145. In this regard, there is a distinct but related matter that the Tribunal feels bound to\u00a0address, having regard to the likelihood that the Claimant may decide to make a\u00a0fresh request for arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules. In the event that\u00a0such a request is made, it would be unfortunate if the Respondent were to adopt a\n151 Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute (El Salvador v. Honduras), Judgment on Application to\u00a0Intervene, [1990] I.C.J. Rep. 92 at 118.

This matter arose during the hearing held on\u00a0September 30, 2009. In response to a question from the Tribunal, the Respondent\u00a0confirmed without qualification that the proper forum for the resolution of this\u00a0dispute was by arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules.155\n146. The Tribunal has taken note of the Respondent's explicit confirmation in this\u00a0regard. There is no reason to suppose that the Respondent might adopt a different\u00a0position in any future proceedings under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, and\u00a0the Claimant is entitled to expect that a consistent position is maintained by the\u00a0Respondent in the face of any future proceedings.\nVIII.4 Conclusion\n147. Under the BIT, the Claimant is entitled to bring arbitration proceedings under\u00a0Article XII of the BIT in respect of a dispute that meets the requirements of that\u00a0Treaty. Equally, the Respondent is entitled to expect that the intention of the drafters\u00a0of the Treaty will be respected with regards to the choice of appropriate forum. The\u00a0Tribunal concludes that arbitration proceedings under the Additional Facility Rules\u00a0were, within the meaning of Article XII(4) of the BIT, \u201cavailable\u201d to the Claimant\u00a0on October 1, 2008, and that that was and still is the proper forum in which to bring\u00a0this dispute. For this reason, and on the basis that the preliminary issue is one of\u00a0jurisdiction rather than admissibility (since it relates to a condition which limits the\u00a0consent of the Parties to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal),156 the Tribunal decides\u00a0that it does not have jurisdiction over the claim brought by the Claimant.\n155 See Procedural Hearing Transcript, September 30, 2009, pp. 42-44:\nARBITRATOR SANDS: \u2026Are you saying that when that claim was submitted under this BIT \u2026 Venezuela accepted the jurisdiction on the basis of this BIT in relation to that claim in the sense of\u00a0accepting to have it litigated before Additional Facility Rules?\nMR. GOODMAN: That is correct.\nARBITRATOR SANDS: So, to put you on the spot, 64 million-dollar question and you may not want to answer it, if that had happened in this case, what would Venezuela have done?\nMR. GOODMAN: I don't think it would have had a choice with respect to it. The Treaty is clear. [\u2026]\nARBITRATOR SANDS: So, subject to whatever other jurisdictional objections Venezuela may have, the position is that \u2026 [t]hese issues ought not to be being addressed before the PCA. These issues\u00a0ought to be being addressed before the Additional Facility of ICSID?\nMR. GOODMAN: That is correct. Well, not before UNCITRAL Rules. [\u2026].\n156 See Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), [2006]\u00a0I.C.J. Rep. 5 at 39, \u00b688 (\u201cThe Court recalls in this regard that its jurisdiction is based on the consent of the\u00a0parties and is confined to the extent accepted by them (see paragraph 65 above). When that consent is expressed\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction\nApril 22, 2010\nPage 49 of 52\n148. It will be for the Claimant to decide what course it might wish to pursue in the\u00a0future. It is free to bring arbitration proceedings under the Additional Facility Rules.\u00a0This Tribunal does not foresee that such a request would face obstacles as to\u00a0approval or registration, but that is ultimately a matter for another body to decide.\u00a0The possibility cannot be excluded, of course, that for some unforeseen or\u00a0unforeseeable reason the Secretary-General of ICSID might not proceed to approve\u00a0the arbitration agreement and register the request. In such circumstances, Article\u00a0XII(4) of the Treaty would entitle the Claimant to bring proceedings under the\u00a0UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Respondent has suggested that in this situation,\u00a0the Claimant would have to start a new UNCITRAL procedure, and request the\u00a0designation of a new tribunal, because in Venezuela's opinion there is a defect in\u00a0the composition of this Tribunal and after this decision it should become functus\u00a0officio.157\n149. The Tribunal has turned its mind to the consequences of such a situation, however\u00a0unlikely it may be. It has given careful consideration to the possibility that it might\u00a0stay a decision on the preliminary issue, having regard to other cases in which an\u00a0arbitral tribunal has decided to stay (rather than terminate) proceedings. The\u00a0Tribunal has, in particular, identified a number of precedents suggesting that an\u00a0international arbitral tribunal may decide to stay a procedure rather than adopt a\u00a0final and definitive order terminating proceedings in circumstances in which some\u00a0other competent forum has jurisdiction over some part of a claim.158 These cases,\u00a0however, invariably dealt with a different situation to the one that is here faced,\u00a0in a compromissory clause in an international agreement, any conditions to which such consent is subject must\u00a0be regarded as constituting the limits thereon. The Court accordingly considers that the examination of such\u00a0conditions relates to its jurisdiction and not to the admissibility of the application (see Mavrommatis Palestine\u00a0Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, pp. 11-15; Interpretation of the Statute of the\u00a0Memel Territory, Merits, Judgment, 1932, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 49, pp. 327-328; Electricity Company of\u00a0Sofia and Bulgaria, Judgment, 1939, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 77, pp. 78-80; South West Africa (Ethiopia v.\u00a0South Africa; Liberia v.

The\u00a0Tribunal notes that:\n(a) in SGS v. Philippines, for example, the arbitral tribunal ruled that it had jurisdiction over a part of the claim, but decided that the claim was\u00a0inadmissible, because the parties to the dispute had agreed by contract to\u00a0go to the Philippine courts to resolve aspects of the contractual issues\u00a0over which the tribunal found it had jurisdiction.159\n(b) In the MOX Plant Case (Ireland v. United Kingdom), an Arbitral Tribunal established under Annex VII of the 1982 UN Convention on the\u00a0Law of the Sea did not conclude that it had no jurisdiction or that the\u00a0claim was inadmissible. Rather it concluded that it faced a situation in\u00a0which there were \u201csubstantial doubts\u201d whether the jurisdiction of the\u00a0Annex VII Tribunal could be \u201cfirmly established in respect of all or any\u00a0of the claims in the dispute\u201d in circumstances where some or all of the\u00a0claims might fall within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,\u00a0with the result that Ireland would not, as a matter of European\u00a0Community law, be able to raise the claims before an UNCLOS Annex\u00a0VII Arbitral Tribunal. In these particular circumstances, the Annex VII\u00a0Tribunal suspended the proceedings by reference to \u201cconsiderations of\u00a0mutual respect and comity which should prevail between judicial\u00a0institutions both of which may be called upon to determine rights and\u00a0obligations as between two States.\u201d160\n(c) In SPP v. Egypt, an ICSID tribunal rejected certain jurisdictional\u00a0objections of the Respondent, but decided to stay the proceedings in\u00a0respect of other jurisdictional objections until proceedings before the\u00a0French courts \u201cfinally resolved\u201d the question of whether the parties had\u00a0decided to refer the dispute to the jurisdiction of the International\u00a0Chamber of Commerce.161\n150. In each of these three cases, it is important to note that the arbitral tribunal stayed\u00a0proceedings in circumstances in which it had not decided that it did not have\n159 SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance v.

The present case is different: the Tribunal has concluded\u00a0without ambiguity that it does not have jurisdiction, because arbitration proceedings\u00a0under the Additional Facility Rules were \u201cavailable\u201d on October 1, 2008. Having so\u00a0concluded, it does not appear that there could be a reasonable basis for the Tribunal\u00a0to stay a decision on jurisdiction in circumstances in which it has decided that it has\u00a0no jurisdiction. In this way, the distinction between an issue of admissibility and\u00a0jurisdiction may rightly be seen to be \u201ca matter of considerable concrete\u00a0importance.\u201d162 The Tribunal has not been able to identify any authority that allows\u00a0a contrary approach. Accordingly, it has no real option but to proceed to terminate\u00a0the proceedings, subject to the issue of costs.\n151. The Claimant and the Respondent have requested that the Tribunal order the\u00a0counterparty to pay all fees and costs incurred in these preliminary proceedings. The\u00a0Tribunal decides that each party shall submit, within one month of the date of this\u00a0decision, a detailed breakdown as to the costs it has incurred in these proceedings up\u00a0to and including the date of this decision. The breakdown should not include any\u00a0further allegations regarding costs, the Tribunal being sufficiently briefed on this\u00a0issue. Thereafter the Tribunal will adopt a decision on costs.\n162 See Jan Paulsson, \u201cJurisdiction and Admissibility\u201d in Global Reflections on International Law, Commerce\u00a0and Dispute Resolution: Liber Amicorum in honour of Robert Briner (Paris: ICC Publishing, 2005) at 601.\nPCA 35146\nAward on Jurisdiction\nApril 22, 2010\nPage 52 of 52\nIX.
