INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.1.\n\nOn 30 December 2009, Claimant, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 \u0130n\u015faat \u0130thalat \u0130hracat Sanayi ve Ticaret 1.1 Anonim \u015eirketi (also referred to as \"Kilic\"), a company with registered offices in Istanbul, Turkey, filed a Request for Arbitration (\"Request\") before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") alleging breaches by Respondent, Turkmenistan (referred to indistinctively as \"Turkmenistan\" or \"Respondent\") of the Agreement Between the Republic of Turkey and Turkmenistan Concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 13 March 1997 (\"BIT\").\n\n1.2.\n\nThe Request was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 19 January 2010, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\").\n\n1.3.\n\nClaimant and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"parties.\" The parties\u2019 respective representatives and their addresses are listed above.\n\n***The First Tribunal***\n------------------------\n\n1.4.\n\nOn 20 March, 2010, Claimant informed the Centre that pursuant to Rule 2(3) of the Centre\u2019s Rule of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, it elected to have the Tribunal constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Centre acknowledged Claimant\u2019s election by letter dated 22 March 2010, and the parties proceeded with the appointment of the arbitrators.\n\n1.5.\n\nOn 7 December 2010, a tribunal (\"First Tribunal\") was constituted, comprising Professor William W. Park (USA), appointed by Claimant, Professor Philippe Sands QC (UK/France), appointed by Respondent, and Professor Emmanuel Gaillard (France), appointed as its President by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID, in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention. Ms. A\u00efssatou Diop, ICSID, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n1.6.\n\nOn 8 December 2010, the Centre requested each party to make an initial advance payment of US$ 100,000.00 to cover the costs of the proceedings in the first three to six months of the case. The Centre received the payment from the parties in due course.\n\n1.7.\n\nOn 31 January 2011, the First Tribunal held a first session, alone without the parties, by telephone-conference, in order to meet the time limit for the Tribunal\u2019s first session set forth under Rule 13(1) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n***Objections to Jurisdiction***\n--------------------------------\n\n1.8.\n\nOn 11 February 2011, having been made aware of Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and proposal that these proceedings be bifurcated as between jurisdiction and merits, the First Tribunal invited the parties to provide submissions on the issue of the bifurcation of these proceedings.\n\n1.9.\n\nOn 22 February 2011, Respondent wrote to the First Tribunal setting out its brief submission on the nature of (but not justifications for) its objections to jurisdiction, as Requested in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 11 February 2011.\n\n1.10.\n\nOn 2 March 2011, Claimant wrote to the First Tribunal setting out its response to the First Tribunal\u2019s letter of 11 February 2011, and to Respondent\u2019s submission of 22 February 2011.\n\n***First Meeting***\n-------------------\n\n1.11.\n\nOn 14 March 2011, the First Tribunal held a procedural consultation with the parties (\"First Meeting\") by teleconference at 12:00 p.m., Washington, D.C. time.\n\n1.12.\n\nDuring the course of the First Meeting, the parties confirmed, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) the rules applicable to this arbitration are the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings as amended as of 10 April 2006 **(\"Rules\");**\n\n(b) the First Tribunal had been constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Rules;\n\n(c) the proceedings would be held in Paris; and\n\n(d) the language of the proceedings would be in English.\n\n1.13.\n\nAs regards the written and oral procedures to be adopted in the arbitration, after hearing each party\u2019s oral presentation, the First Tribunal decided that:\n\n(a) Respondent would have three weeks to elaborate on the nature of each of the five grounds on which it based its objections to jurisdiction;\n\n(b) Claimant would have three weeks thereafter to respond;\n\n(c) in their respective submissions, each party was to provide alternative procedural calendars, one with bifurcation and one without; and\n\n(d) the First Tribunal would then decide on bifurcation.\n\n***The Parties\u2019 Further Comments on Jurisdiction***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1.14.\n\nOn 4 April 2011, Respondent provided further observations on the issue of bifurcation of the proceedings and the nature of its objections to jurisdiction, as directed by the Tribunal during the First Meeting.\n\n1.15.\n\nOn 25 April 2011, Claimant provided further observations on the issue of bifurcation of the proceedings and set out its response to Respondent\u2019s letter of 4 April 2011, as directed by the Tribunal during the First Meeting.\n\n***The Second Tribunal***\n-------------------------\n\n1.16.\n\nOn 2 May 2011, Professor Gaillard resigned from the Tribunal. On 3 May 2011, the Secretary-General notified the parties of the vacancy on the First Tribunal and suspended the proceeding in accordance with Rule 10(2).\n\n1.17.\n\nOn 24 May 2011, the First Tribunal was reconstituted (\"Tribunal\"), with Professor Park and Professor Sands continuing, and with the appointment, by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID, of Mr J. William Rowley QC, as its President. In accordance with Rule 12, the proceeding resumed on that same date.\n\n1.18.\n\nOn 24 August 2011, the Secretary General announced to the parties and the Tribunal that Ms. Diop would take a temporary leave of absence and that Ms. Mair\u00e9e Uran Bidegain, had been designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal during her absence. On 10 January 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties and the Tribunal that Ms. Mair\u00e9e Uran Bidegain would continue serving as Secretary of the Tribunal on a permanent basis.\n\n***Decision on Bifurcation and Early Determination of BIT Issues***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.19.\n\nOn 30 June 2011, having considered the parties\u2019 submissions on bifurcation, the Tribunal issued a reasoned decision on bifurcation, declining to direct bifurcation of the proceedings. In reaching this decision, the Tribunal made it clear that it had in no way pre-judged the outcome of any of the jurisdictional objections raised, that Respondent was fully entitled to maintain such objections as it considered appropriate, and that they would be addressed as joined to the merits of the dispute in the manner envisaged by Article 41 of the ICSID Convention. However, having regard to the parties\u2019 differences concerning Article VII.2 of the BIT, and the significance of that issue, the Tribunal considered it would be appropriate, at an early stage, to determine:\n\n(a) the number of authentic versions of the BIT; and\n\n(b) to the extent there are authentic version(s) of the BIT in languages other than English - accurate translations into English of any authentic version(s) of the BIT.\n\nMindful of the need for early resolution of these issues in order to avoid unnecessary cost and argument later in the proceedings, the Tribunal also indicated that it wished to explore further the meaning and effect of Article VII.2 of the BIT.\n\n1.20.\n\nHaving also considered the parties\u2019 respective proposed timetables, and bearing in mind that the case was registered with the Centre some 15 months earlier, the Tribunal established the timetable for the case, fixing all procedural steps up to and including the production of a hearing bundle on 29 October 2012. The hearing date was to be fixed at a later date.\n\n1.21.\n\nAs regards its questions concerning Article VII.2 of the BIT, referred to at 1.19 above (\"BIT Issues\"), the timetable provided for two rounds of simultaneous written submissions as follows:\n\n(a) by 1 August 2011, submissions on what constitutes authentic versions / accurate English translation(s) of the BIT, as well as the meaning and effect of Article VII.2, together with documentary testimonial or expert evidence relied upon; and\n\n(b) by 15 August 2011, simultaneous reply submissions on what constitutes authentic versions / accurate English translation(s) of the BIT, as well as the meaning and effect of Article VII.2, together with documentary, testimonial or expert evidence relied upon.\n\n***Subsequent Procedural Matters***\n-----------------------------------\n\n1.22.\n\nOn 13 July 2011, Claimant requested that the procedural calendar be extended by an additional step, to allow it to file a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction if Respondent submits its objections to jurisdiction with its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (making that pleading Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction).\n\n1.23.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal invited Respondent to submit its comments, if any, on Claimant\u2019s request by 18 July 2011, which Respondent provided in due course.\n\n1.24.\n\nOn 1 August 2011, the parties exchanged written submissions on the BIT Issues. Claimant\u2019s submission was supported by an email to Claimant from Mrs. \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7, a report from Mr. Fuat Kasimcan and an expert report from Professor Yusuf \u00c7aliskan. Respondent\u2019s submission was supported by a legal opinion by Dr. Emre Oktem and Dr. Mehmet Karli.\n\n1.25.\n\nOn 15 August 2011, the parties exchanged written reply submissions on the BIT Issues. Claimant\u2019s submission was supported by a report from Mr Ibrahim Uslu. Respondent\u2019s submission was supported by a second legal opinion from Dr. Oktem and Dr. Karli and an expert report from Professor Jacklin Komfilt.\n\n1.26.\n\nOn 8 September 2011, following consultation with the parties, and with their agreement, the Tribunal fixed the dates of 14-18 January 2013 for the oral hearing on the merits and jurisdiction - the hearing to take place at the World Bank\u2019s facilities in Paris.\n\n1.27.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal advised the parties that, unless they were content that the BIT Issues should be decided on the papers, the Tribunal considered that a one-day, in-person, oral hearing would be of assistance, to be attended by counsel and the parties\u2019 legal experts.\n\n1.28.\n\nThe Tribunal also advised the parties that, having considered the parties\u2019 submissions regarding Claimant\u2019s application to add a final (fifth) Memorial/pleading four weeks after Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder Memorial, it was not, for the moment, disposed to add the requested fifth memorial. The Tribunal noted that this was not a case in which jurisdictional objections would appear suddenly in the Counter-Memorial (Claimant having already been made aware of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections through two sets of written exchanges). In these circumstances, the Tribunal noted that Claimant would be in a position to deal initially with Respondent\u2019s objections, to the extent that it wished, in its Memorial. However, should it turn out that any new objections were raised for the first time in Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, the matter could be revisited.\n\n1.29.\n\nOn 15 September 2011, the parties commented on the Tribunal\u2019s suggestion to hold a one-day hearing on the BIT Issues.\n\n1.30.\n\nOn 23 September 2011, having considered the parties\u2019 comments, the Tribunal fixed 17 January 2012 for a one-day hearing in London on the BIT Issues. At the same time, it confirmed Paris as the place for the substantive hearing on 14-18 January 2013. The parties were also invited to discuss, with a view to agreeing, a proposal on the approach to/time allocation for the hearing on the BIT Issues.\n\n1.31.\n\nHaving been advised shortly thereafter of Mr Volterra\u2019s unavailability on 17 January 2012, and having confirmed the availability of all counsel, and their experts, on 20 January 2012, the Tribunal requested the parties to block 20 January 2012 for the BIT Issues hearing.\n\n1.32.\n\nOn 3 October 2011, Claimant wrote to the Centre stating that Mr Fatih Serbest had been dismissed as counsel of record for Claimant in the case.\n\n1.33.\n\nOn 4 October 2011, the Tribunal advised the parties that the hearing on BIT Issues in London was confirmed for 20 January 2012, starting at 10:00 a.m.\n\n1.34.\n\nOn that same date, Claimant advised the Centre that it had appointed Ms Yasemin \u00c7etinel to act on its behalf as its legal representative along with Volterra Fietta (which firm had been on record from the start) in these proceedings.\n\n1.35.\n\nOn 24 October 2011, Claimant advised the Centre that the parties had agreed to amend the pleading schedule set out in the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1 of 30 June 2011, which agreement, amongst other things, would lead to a new hearing date-June 2013 being suggested. The parties requested the Tribunal to endorse this agreed schedule. Respondent agreed with the content of Claimant\u2019s communication on 25 October 2011.\n\n1.36.\n\nOn 4 November 2011, the Tribunal advised the parties that it was in general agreement with the new proposed timetable and confirmed its availability for a five-day hearing in Paris, commencing on 17 June 2013. The parties were also advised that their proposed new schedule was problematic with respect to the timetable for disclosure of documents. The parties were therefore requested to propose a slight adjustment. Once a new proposal had been agreed, the Tribunal indicated it would be pleased to consider it for endorsement.\n\n1.37.\n\nOn 23 November 2011, the Centre requested Claimant to make a second advance payment of US $125,040.00 and Respondent to make a second advance payment of US $125,000.00.\n\n1.38.\n\nBy correspondence dated 2 November 2011, 25 November 2011 and 30 November 2011, the parties provided their proposals for the conduct of the 20 January 2012 BIT Issues hearing. Respondent proposed, *inter alia,* that the hearing should focus on what the experts had to say. It favoured expert conferencing with the parties\u2019 legal experts, and suggested that its linguistic expert, Professor Komfilt, attend for examination and subsequent questioning by Claimant. Claimant indicated that it did not require any of Respondent\u2019s experts to attend the hearing to be cross-examined and thus did not see the need for them to attend. Claimant also noted that Respondent had declined to Request that Claimant make available any of its experts for cross examination.\n\n1.39.\n\nOn 11 December 2011, the Tribunal advised the parties, *inter alia,* that it continued to feel that it would be helpful for the parties\u2019 legal experts to attend the hearing to enable the members of the Tribunal to raise questions directly with them. Accordingly, the Tribunal invited the parties to arrange for the attendance of their respective legal experts at the 20 January 2012 hearing. Since neither party had notified the other that it required the other parties\u2019 expert(s) for cross-examination, the Tribunal proposed that the legal experts appear together, to respond to such questions as the Tribunal might have. Counsel for the parties would then have the opportunity to ask questions arising from the answers given to the Tribunal\u2019s questions. Respondent was also invited to have its linguistic expert available by video-conference facility, against the event the Tribunal had questions.\n\n1.40.\n\nOn 13 December 2011, Respondent advised the Tribunal that it objected to the attendance of Mr Kasimcan, Mrs \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7 and Mr Uslu, stating that the Tribunal had only required the legal experts to attend and these experts did not fit in such category, and that the appearance of these three officials of the Government of the Republic of Turkey, would contravene Article 27 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n1.41.\n\nOn 19 December 2011, following further correspondence with the parties relating to the conduct of the 20 January 2012 hearing, the Tribunal advised that there would be an opportunity for counsel to make brief opening statements, following which the experts were requested to be available for questions (there would be no need for introductory statements, or testimony in chief), following which there would be an opportunity for counsel to make brief closing statements.\n\n1.42.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s objection to the attendance of Mr Kasimcan, Mrs \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7 and Mr Uslu, based on Article 27 of the Convention, the Tribunal clarified that, when it issued its 11 December 2011 invitation, it principally had in mind the attendance (for Claimant) of Professor Caliskan. Nevertheless, it advised that it did not consider Respondent\u2019s objection to be well founded and that, if Claimant wished them to attend, they might do so. If they did, and should the Tribunal question any of them, counsel would be given the opportunity to ask follow-on questions.\n\n1.43.\n\nOn 23 December 2011, following further correspondence from the parties in which *inter alia,* Claimant did not state that it wished Mr Kasimcan, Mrs \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7 and Mr Uslu to attend, the Tribunal confirmed that it did not feel that the attendance of the three officials would be sufficiently helpful as to warrant their travel to London.\n\n1.44.\n\nOn that same date, Claimant advised the Tribunal that the parties had agreed to a further amendment of the pleading schedule. Whilst the proposed amendment would not affect the 20 January 2012 BIT Issues hearing, it would affect the planned merits/jurisdictional hearing of 14-18 June 2013. Amongst other things, a new hearing date was suggested for October 2013.\n\n1.45.\n\nOn 3 January 2012, neither party having made the second advance payment that had been requested on 23 November 2011, the Centre followed up with the parties.\n\n1.46.\n\nOn 4 January 2012, Respondent\u2019s counsel advised that Respondent\u2019s second advance payment would be made by the next week at the latest.\n\n1.47.\n\nOn 5 January 2012, Claimant\u2019s counsel advised that Claimant expected to make its second advance payment within 30 days.\n\n1.48.\n\nOn the same day, following a number of exchanges between the Tribunal and the parties on the proposed new schedule, the Tribunal advised the parties that it would be sensible to discuss these matters in person, and to fix a new schedule that worked for all concerned during the hearing in London on 20 January 2012.\n\n1.49.\n\nOn 17 January 2012, Claimant wrote to the Centre, denying Respondent\u2019s assertion (see Section 4, Respondent\u2019s Case) that the Turkish version of the BIT published on the Turkish Undersecretariat of the Treasury\u2019s website states that Turkish is one of the authentic languages in which the BIT was executed. A copy of the Turkish version of the BIT as downloaded from the website was attached.\n\n1.50.\n\nOn the same day, Respondent wrote to the Centre:\n\n(a) providing a revised certified translation into English of the authentic Russian version of the BIT (Exhibit R-l (revised)), with a letter from the translators explaining the reason for the submission of the revised translation; and\n\n(b) advising that the Turkish version of the BIT that was on the Undersecretariat\u2019s website in early August 2011 had indeed listed Turkish as an authentic language of the BIT.\n\n***The 20 January 2012 Hearing***\n---------------------------------\n\n1.51.\n\nThe BIT Issues hearing was held, as scheduled, in London on 20 January 2012 at the IDRC, 70 Fleet Street, London, EC4Y 1EU, United Kingdom. The hearing was recorded and transcribed.\n\n1.52.\n\nAt the hearing, the Tribunal heard oral testimony from the following experts presented by Claimant:\n\n(a) Professor Yusuf \u00c7aliskan\n\n1.53.\n\nThe Tribunal also heard oral testimony from the following experts presented by Respondent:\n\n(a) Dr. Emre \u00d4ktem\n\n(b) Dr. Mehmet Karli\n\n(c) Dr. Jaklin Komfilt\n\n1.54.\n\nIn the light of the parties\u2019 prior agreement and the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the available time at the hearing was divided roughly equally.\n\n1.55.\n\nDuring the course of the hearing, and having regard to the revised English translation of the Russian version of Article VII.2 that had been filed on 17 January 2012, counsel for Respondent invited the Tribunal to appoint a qualified Russian expert translator to provide a further translation of Article VII.2.1 When questioned about Respondent\u2019s invitation, Claimant\u2019s counsel suggested that such a course would be highly unusual and advised that Claimant had no desire for further expenditures for such a translation. However, Claimant\u2019s counsel also advised that this was \"not an informed response\".2\n\nTranscript of 20 January 2012 Hearing, pp. 167/21 - 168/11.\n\n*Id.* atp. 184/8 - 184/24.\n\n1.56.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, when the question of the payment of the second advances and the future scheduling were discussed, the Tribunal was advised that:\n\n(a) Claimant would be in a position to make its payment within 30 days;\n\n(b) Respondent had now made payment of the requested second advance; and\n\n(c) because the decision on the BIT Issues had the potential to be dispositive of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the parties were agreed that the Tribunal should decide the BIT Issues prior to considering a new timetable based on the parties\u2019 proposed amendment of the previously settled pleading schedule.\n\n1.57.\n\nOn 10 February 2012, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, noting that Claimant had not paid its share and requesting that the funds it had disbursed be exclusively used for payment of expenses already incurred in connection with the 20 January 2012 hearing.\n\n1.58.\n\nOn 13 February 2012, the Centre informed the parties of Claimant\u2019s default in the payment of the second advance requested from it. Claimant was requested to confirm that it intended to and would make such payment by 20 February 2012.\n\n1.59.\n\nOn 20 February 2012, Claimant informed the Centre that it had paid its share of the second advance payment.\n\n1.60.\n\nOn 22 February 2012, the Centre advised the parties that, because of the Tribunal\u2019s continuing uncertainty as to the accuracy of the two English translations tendered by Respondent of Article VII.2 of the authentic Russian language version of the BIT, and the possible relevance of the English translation of Article VII.2 of the Turkish language version of the BIT published in the Turkish Official Gazette on 15 January 1995, it proposed to request two independent and qualified expert translators to provide it with English language translations of the relevant texts.\n\n1.61.\n\nThe parties were provided with the names and credentials of the translators that had been identified, together with the text of the Tribunal\u2019s proposed instructions to them. The parties were asked to comment by 1 March 2012 on the instructions the Tribunal proposed to issue to the expert translators.\n\n1.62.\n\nOn 27 February 2012, Respondent confirmed that it was content with the Tribunal\u2019s proposal to instruct independent expert translators. It proposed that a further question be asked to the Russian-English translator and raised a question as to the potential suitability of the Turkish-English translator.\n\n1;63.\n\nOn 28 February 2012, Claimant advised the Tribunal \"that it does not agree to the Tribunal taking up the Respondent\u2019s proposal on this point\" *(i.e.,* the appointment by the Tribunal of an independent translatons)).\n\n1.64.\n\nOn 6 March 2012, having regard to the absence of agreement of the parties to the Tribunal\u2019s retainer of/instru\u00e9tions to independent translators, the Tribunal advised the parties that it would proceed by analysing the BIT Issues on the existing record of the evidence and argument before it. The Tribunal reserved the right to instruct an independent expert in the event that it considered it necessary to do so.\n\n1.65.\n\nFollowing the hearing, the members of the Tribunal deliberated by various means of communications including a meeting in London, United Kingdom, on 20 January 2012 and by a teleconference thereafter. In reaching its conclusions in this Decision, the Tribunal has taken into account all pleadings, documents, testimony, expert opinions and oral submissions filed or made so far in this case.\n\n**2. THE FACTS**\n----------------\n\n2.1.\n\nA review of disputing parties\u2019 submissions, witness statements, expert reports and the oral testimony given at the hearing indicates that, with few exceptions, the factual matrix of the negotiation and conclusion of the BIT is either agreed or not seriously disputed.3 Put another way, most of the differences between the parties as regards the BIT issues have to do with: (a) the proper construction of the concluding statement in the Russian version of the BIT which provides \"[e]xecuted on May 2, 1992 in two authentic copies in Turkish, Turkmen, English and the Russian language\" - *i.e.,* the number of authentic versions of the BIT; (b) the accurate English translation of the authentic Russian version of Article VII.2 of the BIT; and, (c) the parties\u2019 competing visions as to the proper construction (meaning and effect) of Article VII.2 of the BIT.\n\nThe parties differed on whether an English or a Turkish text was used in the negotiations, but, in the end, and given the absence of clear evidence, nothing turned on this point.\n\n2.2.\n\nIn particular, Claimant construes Article VII.2 of the BIT to mean that \"recourse to the domestic courts of the Respondent prior to seeking dispute resolution through international arbitration is only an optional choice for the investor, not a compulsory requirement\".4\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission of 1 August 2011, para 21.\n\n2.3.\n\nRespondent construes Article VII.2 of the BIT to require \"prior submission of a dispute to national courts as a condition precedent to the commencement of international arbitration against Turkmenistan\".5\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission of 1 August 2011, para. 55.\n\n2.4.\n\nWe set out in detail below a summary of the facts most relevant to a determination of the BIT Issues - either as agreed, not disputed or determined by the Tribunal.\n\n***Signing of the BIT***\n------------------------\n\n2.5.\n\nThe BIT was signed on 2 May 1992 in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan.\n\n2.6.\n\nIt is common ground that the parties signed both an English language version and a Russian language version of the BIT at that time. It is common ground that both are authentic versions of the BIT.\n\n2.7.\n\nNeither of the parties produced signed copies of the BIT in any other language, and the Tribunal concludes on the basis of the evidence before it that the BIT was signed only in its English and Russian versions.\n\n2.8.\n\nThe authentic English version of the BIT provides that the Treaty was:\n\n*\"DONE at Ashghbat on the day of May 2, 1992 in two authentic copies in Russian and English.\"6*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Annex D; Exhibit R-2 (hereinafter all references to the English version of the BIT will be deemed references to these two identical documents submitted by Claimant and Respondent, respectively).\n\n2.9.\n\nThe authentic Russian version of the BIT (translated into English) states:\n\n*\"Executed on May 2, 1992 in two authentic copies in Turkish,* *Turkmen, English and Russian languages.\"7*\n\nExhibit R-l ; Exhibit R-l (revised).\n\n***Article VII.2 of the BIT***\n------------------------------\n\n2.10.\n\nThe text of Article VII.2 that appears in the English version of the BIT provides, in pertinent part as follows:\n\n*\"2. If these desputes (sic) cannot be settled in this way within six months following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the dispute can be submitted, as the investor may choose, to:*\n\n*(a)...*\n\n*(b)...*\n\n*(c)...*\n\n*provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been rendered within one year.\"*\n\n2.11.\n\nThe text of Article VII.2 that appears in the Russian version of the BIT (translated literally into English) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n*\"2. If the referenced conflicts cannot be settled in this way within six months following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the conflict may be submitted at investors choice to*\n\n*(a)...*\n\n*(b)...*\n\n*(c) The Court of Arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce, on the condition that, if the concerned investor submitted the conflict to the court of the Party,* *that is a Party to the conflict, and a final arbitral award on compensation of damages has not been rendered within one year.\"8*\n\n*Id.*\n\n***Context of the BIT and Circumstances of its Conclusions***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.12.\n\nThe BIT was signed shortly after Turkmenistan established its independence as a sovereign state, after many years as part of the Soviet Union.\n\n2.13.\n\nTurkey was one of the first countries to recognise the newly-declared independence of the four former Turkick Republics - Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan - in November and December 1991, and to establish diplomatic relations with them, which was accomplished by early 1992.\n\n2.14.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1993, approximately 1,200 delegations of Turkish government representatives visited these new states and, during the same period, Turkey signed more than 140 treaties with them.\n\n2.15.\n\nIt was against this background that the Prime Minister of Turkey at the time, Suleyman Demirel, conducted an eight-day tour of the Turkick States beginning on 27 April 1992.\n\n2.16.\n\nDuring this tour, *inter-alia,* Turkey signed BITs with each of the four Turkic States within a five-day period, *i.e.,* between 28 April 1992 and 2 May 1992.\n\n2.17.\n\nThe Turkey-Kyrgyzstan BIT was signed on 28 April 1992. This bilateral investment treaty, which is stated to be \"DONE... in two authentic copies in English\", contains exactly the same Article VII.2 provisions as are found in the English language version of the BIT.\n\n2.18.\n\nThe Turkey-Uzbekistan BIT was also signed on 28 April 1992. This treaty is also stated to be \"DONE at Tashkent on the day of 28/4/1992 in two authentic copies in English\". Article VII.2 of the English version of the Turkey-Uzbekistan BIT is exactly the same as Article VII.2 of the English version of the BIT.\n\n2.19.\n\nThe Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT was signed on 1 May 1992. It provides that it was \"DONE at Alma Ata on the day of 1 May 1992 in two authentic copies each in Turkish, Kazak (sic), English and Russian.\" The text of Article VII.2 of the English and Turkish versions of the Turkey-Kazakh BIT are identical to the texts of the authentic English version of the BIT and the \"official\" Turkish version of the BIT that was published in the Turkish Official Gazette on 15 January 1995.9\n\nExhibit EO/MK-6.\n\n***Turkish Ratification of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------\n\n2.20.\n\nTurkey ratified its investment treaties with the four Turkick States using its ordinary procedures of ratification, culminating in their publication in the Official Gazette on 15 January 1995.\n\n2.21.\n\nThe first step in the ratification involved sending the four treaties, together with their respective draft Laws of Approbation to the Turkish Parliament in 1993.\n\n2.22.\n\nThe letter which submitted the BIT to the Turkish Parliament included, *inter alia,* explanatory notes on the treaty\u2019s text. The following description was provided for Article VII:\n\n***\"Article 7 -***  *This article regulates the resolution of investment disputes which may arise between a Party and an investor of the other Party. According to the procedure which has been foreseen, the Parties will first try to resolve the dispute by way of negotiations, in the event the dispute is not resolved within 6 months, provided that the access to local judicial bodies remains open, the right to proceed to international arbitration may be used. In addition, if the investor has brought the dispute before local judicial bodies and the final decision is obtained, it will not be possible for the investor to proceed to international arbitration; however, in the event that no final decision is obtained within 1 year and that both of the Parties have signed these treaties, the dispute may be brought before* *International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)...\"*\n\n*The purpose of the last paragraph is to avoid the repetition of discussion of the disputes which were finally resolved by local courts, before international bodies.\"10*\n\nExhibit EO/MK-l5,p. 3.\n\n2.23.\n\nThe four Laws of Approbation (for the Turkick States\u2019 BITs) were published in the Official Gazette in September 1994.\n\n2.24.\n\nThe Turkish Council of Ministers adopted ratification decrees for the four treaties at the end of 1994 and during the first days of 1995. In the case of the BIT, and as noted above, the respective ratification decree was published in the Official Gazette, dated 15 January 1995, which also included both the authentic English text and an \"official\" Turkish text.\n\n2.25.\n\nThe \"official\" Turkish text of Article VII as published in the Official Gazette is set out, in pertinent part, below in certified English translation:\n\n*\"2. In the event that these disputes cannot be settled within six months following the date of the written notification stated in paragraph 1 above, such dispute can be submitted to the below stated International Judicial Authorities as per the decision of the investor; provided that the investor has brought the subject matter of the dispute to the judicial court of the host Party in accordance with the procedures and laws of the host Party and that a decision has not been rendered within one year:*\n\n(a) *...*\n\n(b) *...*\n\n(c) *...* \".11\n\nExhibit R-3. The English translation of the Turkish text was provided by Respondent. However, Claimant does not dispute the translation, nor did it provide an alternative translation. (In its letter concerning bifurcation dated 25 April 2011, Claimant provided what appears to be an incorrect Turkish text of Article VII.2, translated into English. Respondent pointed out this error in its submission on the BIT Issues dated 1 August 2011. Claimant did not seek to refute Respondent\u2019s position on this point).\n\n**3. CLAIMANT\u2019S CASE**\n----------------------\n\n***Number of Authentic Versions of the BIT***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n3.1.\n\nClaimant contends that there are only two authentic versions of the BIT; the English and Russian language versions. These are said to be the only versions of the BIT that were signed by the Contracting States. Claimant argues that both expressly state that there are only two authentic copies.12\n\nRespondent has produced two copies of the Turkish text, under Exhibits R-3 and EO/MK-6 and Exhibits R-4 and EO/MK -37, neither of which is signed. No copy of the Turkmen text was produced - Respondent advising that none could be found.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe authentic English version of the BIT provides that the treaty was:\n\n*\"DONE at Ashgabat on the day of May 2, 1992 in two authentic copies in Russian and English.\"*\n\n3.3.\n\nBy contrast, Claimant initially alleged that the authentic Russian version of the BIT (translated into English) states:\n\n*\"it is comprised on May 2, 1992 in two authentic copies in Turkish, Turkmen, English and the Russian language.\"13*\n\nAlthough a dispute developed as to the accurate Russian-English translation of BIT Article VII.2, the parties eventually agreed on the translation of this clause. Claimant provided this translation in its 1 August 2011 submission but appeared to have abandoned it in its 15 August 2011 submission, when it instead referred to Respondent\u2019s submitted translation using the word \"Executed on...\". *See* Claimant\u2019s Submission of 15 August 2011 \u00b6 7, citing Respondent\u2019s submitted translation. The English translations of the Russian version submitted under Exhibits R-l or R-l (revised), do not include the word \"comprise\" but instead \"Executed on...\".\n\n3.4.\n\nClaimant asserts that the English version of the BIT clearly identifies the two authentic copies as the Russian and English versions. Although the authentic Russian version refers to two authentic copies in four languages, Claimant argues that the two authentic copies referred to in the Russian version are the signed Russian and English versions.\n\n3.5.\n\nClaimant further argues that no signed versions of the BIT exist in Turkish or Turkmen. However, it maintains that, in order to satisfy national constitutional law requirements, both Turkey and Turkmenistan were required to produce \"official\" translations of the (or one of the) authentic version(s) of the BIT for publication in their respective Official Gazettes. The relevant laws of the two countries make it clear that these \"official\" translations are not authentic versions of the BIT.\n\n3.6.\n\nArticle 3.1(2) of Turkey\u2019s Law No. 244 (unofficially translated into English by Claimant, but not contested by Respondent) states:\n\n*\"The Turkish text of which is the subject of international treaty ratification or accession is published in the Official Gazette with one of the specified authentic language or languages of the treaty as an attachment to the Decree of the Council of Ministers pursuant to the above paragraph.\"14*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission of 1 August 2011, para. 7.\n\n3.7.\n\nArticle 24.3 of the Law of Turkmenistan on the International Treaties of Turkmenistan (unofficially translated into English by Claimant, but not contested by Respondent) states:\n\n*\"The international agreements of Turkmenistan, whose authentic texts are comprised in the foreign languages, are published on one of these languages with the official translation into the Turkmen language.\"15*\n\n*Id.* at para. 9.\n\n3.8.\n\nClaimant notes that Respondent accepts that the English and Russian language versions of the BIT are both authentic.\n\n3.9.\n\nClaimant relies on a report made to it of Mr Ibraham Uslu, General Manager of the General Directorate of Foreign Trade of the Undersecretariat of Treasury of Turkey16**(\"Undersecretariat\"),** who states in his report, *inter alia,* that;\n\n*\"Normally, Bilateral Investment Treaty negotiations are conducted in English.... English is used in the drafting stage* *and in the abridgement stage as this enables parties to see more clearly whether as a result of negotiations they reached a compromise on the issues. Then, in the signature stage, this English draft agreement... is translated into the languages of the Contracting Parties and the Agreement is signed in the languages of the Contracting Parties, along with English. In the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Turkmenistan and Turkey, however, the observed procedure could not be applied.... In this BIT, the English draft text of the agreement was used by the Turkish side and the Russian translation was made in Turkmenistan and these texts were signed by the Contracting Parties. The translated Turkish text, however, was prepared in Turkey to fulfil the procedural requirements of the approval stage. In this context, the Turkish text is not the authentic text of the agreement, but it is the official translation made according to the approval procedure.\"*\n\n*\"In order for Turkish language version to be authentic, the Contracting Parties should sign the translated Turkish text...* *The publication of the unsigned translated text in the Official Gazette shall not constitute as evidence that it is an authentic version of the BIT.\"*\n\n*\"There is no signed version of the Turkish Text for the Turkmenistan-Turkey BIT.\"*\n\nClaimant says that the role of the Underscretariat is to conduct procedures and negotiations concerning the agreements to be concluded with foreign countries in relation to the bilateral encouragement and protection of investments.\n\n3.10.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent\u2019s claim that there exists an authentic Turkmen version of the BIT is undermined by its own, unexplained concession that no copy of such a text can be found.\n\n3.11.\n\nIt also rejects Respondent\u2019s contention that the Undersecretariat\u2019s website \"declares Turkish as one of the authentic languages of the BIT\".17 Although, Claimant did not provide an English language translation of the Turkish version of the BIT as published in the Official Gazette in either of its BIT Issues submissions, it wrote to the Tribunal on 17 January 2012, to point out what it described as a material error contained in Respondent\u2019s 1 August 2011 submission. It stated that the Turkish version of the BIT that had been filed by Respondent (which was described as having been published on the Undersecretariat\u2019s website and which was said to state that Turkish is one of the authentic languages in which the BIT was executed) \"is not a version of the Turkish BIT that is actually published on the website in question.\"18\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission of 15 August 2011, para 9, citing to Respondent\u2019s Submission of 1 August 2011, para 21.\n\nLetter from Claimant to the Tribunal dated 17 January 2012, p. 1\n\n3.12.\n\nClaimant further advised that the Turkish version of the BIT that is published on the website clearly states that \"there are only two authentic languages in which the BIT was executed; English and Russian.\"19 A notarised copy of the Turkish version of the BIT as downloaded from the website was provided.\n\n*Id*\n\n***Accurate Translation into English of Authentic Versions of the BIT***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.13.\n\nThe English language version of the BIT upon which Claimant relies is not questioned by either party.\n\n3.14.\n\nClaimant did not provide an English language translation of the Russian version of the Treaty. It accepts the translation of the Russian text tendered by Respondent with its submission, 1 August 2011, i.e., as set out in R-l. It does not accept the accuracy of Respondent\u2019s revised translation of the Russian text, as set out in R-l (revised).\n\n3.15.\n\nAs noted above, Claimant does not accept the Turkish version of the Treaty to be authentic. Nevertheless, it contends that: (a) Respondent relies upon an inaccurate, unverified and non-authoritative Turkish-language version of the BIT *(i.e.,* the Turkish version said to have been found on the Undersecreatriat\u2019s website - see paragraph 19 of Respondent\u2019s 1 August 2011 submission (Exhibits R-4 and EO/MK-37)); and (b) the English translation of the BIT published in Turkey\u2019s Official Gazette (Exhibits R-3 and E0/MK-6) is erroneous.\n\n3.16.\n\nIn support of the latter point, Claimant refers to the Turkey-Latvia BIT which has exactly the same dispute settlement provision as found in Article VII.2 of the BIT and which was authenticated in 1997 in three languages (Turkish, Latvian and English), each of which is stated to be equally authentic.\n\n3.17.\n\nClaimant points to the fact that, although the English language versions of Article VII.2 in the two treaties are identical, the authentic Turkish language version of the Turkey-Latvia BIT states clearly that an investor has an option or discretionary power to bring a dispute to the courts of the host state.\n\n3.18.\n\nClaimant maintains that because the Turkish version of the relevant provision of this treaty is authentic, this shows that a translation mistake was made when the same authentic English language version of Article VII.2 of the BIT was translated into Turkish for publication in the Official Gazette.\n\n***Meaning and Effect of Article VII.2***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n3.19.\n\nClaimant argues that the meaning and effect of Article VII.2 as found in the two authentic copies of the BIT is plain; that the investor has the option to pursue resolution of the dispute before Turkmenistan\u2019s domestic courts, but that it is not required to do so before resorting to ICSID arbitration. If it chooses to exercise that option, it is unable to initiate international arbitration proceedings before the expiry of one year.\n\n3.20.\n\nIn support of its interpretation of Article VII.2, Claimant relies on the ordinary meaning of the words used, a letter from Mr Fuat Kasimcan, Head of Department of the Turkish Ministry of Economy of the Undersecretariat, dated 22 July 2011, which confirms the optionality of the text, and an email from Mrs Zergul \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7, of the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade, dated 7 July 2011, to the same effect.\n\n3.21.\n\nClaimant also points to the decision of the *Rumeli* tribunal which, having considered Article VII of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT (which used precisely the same language as the BIT), concluded:\n\n*\"317. By contrast with the Turkish version, the English and Russian versions of the Treaty do not require a prior submission of the dispute to local courts before initiation of arbitration proceedings before ICSID. The Arbitral Tribunal considers therefore that no such requirement had to be fulfilled by Claimants before starting this arbitration.\"20*\n\n*Rumeli Telecom A.S. and Telsim Mobile Telekomik A.S.Y.O.N. Hizmetleri A.S. v Republic of Kazakstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Award of 29 July 2008, para 317.\n\n3.22.\n\nIn addition, Claimant points to the *Sistem* decision which considered the same language as that contained in Article VII.2 of the BIT and, it is said, concluded that resort to local remedies was not a mandatory precondition to ICSID arbitration. That tribunal held:\n\n*\"106. The Respondent takes the view that the words \u2018provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been rendered within one year \u2019 in Article VII(2) apply only to Article VII(2)(c). The Tribunal need take no position on the question because Sistem has not instituted any proceedings in the national courts against the Krygyz Republic.\"21*\n\n*Sistem M\u00fchendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v Krygyz Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/06/1), Decision on Jurisdiction dated 13 September 2007, para. 106.\n\n3.23.\n\nClaimant refers to the undisputed authentic English version of the BIT which states:\n\n*\"provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been rendered within one year.\"*\n\n3.24.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent\u2019s own certified translation of the authentic Russian version, which accompanied its 1 August 2011 submission, contains a formulation which is identical in its meaning:\n\n*\"... on the condition that, if the concerned investor submitted the conflict to the court of the Party, that is a Party to the conflict, and a final arbitral award on compensation of damages has not been rendered within one year.\"*\n\n3.25.\n\nClaimant points out that if either one of the conditional clauses \"provided that\" or \"if\u2019 were removed from the provisions,22 it would be clear that the investor had to pursue local remedies. Thus, the presence of \"if\u2019 in both the English and Russian authentic versions confirms that the Contracting States deliberately adopted the actual formulation of the clause. Claimant describes as \"self-serving\" Respondent\u2019s original argument that the word \"if\u2019 is merely intended to emphasise the strength of the preceding conditions. Moreover, such an interpretation deprives the second conditional word of any meaning. Claimant contended that Respondent\u2019s revised translation was to be rejected because it constituted an interpretation rather than a translation of the text.\n\nIn the Russian translation, \"on the condition that\" or \"if\u2019.\n\n3.26.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s argument that, even if the authentic English and Russian versions of the BIT may plausibly be interpreted in the manner suggested above, this \"may be the result of a mistake in translation\", Claimant says that Respondent\u2019s speculative contention, that the BIT was originally negotiated and drafted in Turkish, and only later translated into English and Russian, is central to this argument.\n\n3.27.\n\nClaimant points out that this speculation is directly contrary to the statements by Mr Kasimcan and Mr Uslu that the first/original version of the BIT was in English. It was subsequently translated into Russian in Turkmenistan; it was signed in English and Russian, and, only later, translated into Turkish.\n\n**4. RESPONDENT\u2019S CASE**\n------------------------\n\n***Number of Authentic Versions of the BIT***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n4.1.\n\nBy way of relevant background, Respondent points out that Turkey was one of the first countries to recognise the newly-declared independence of the four former Turkic Republics (Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) in November and December 1991. Between 1991 and 1993 Turkey signed more than 140 treaties with them.\n\n4.2.\n\nRespondent says that, given the political circumstances and Turkey\u2019s strong interest in establishing its relationships with these countries, speed appears to have been a primary concern. Thus, it says that it is not surprising that accuracy in the documents sometimes suffered in the process.\n\n4.3.\n\nRespondent asserts that Turkey was the driving force in the process of negotiating BITs with the former republics. It argues that this is reflected in the fact that Turkey\u2019s BITs with the Turkic States contain almost identical language: this demonstrates that Turkey undoubtedly drafted the texts of the treaties that were used in each case.\n\n4.4.\n\nTurkmenistan contends that the determination of the authentic versions of the BIT gives rise to questions of interpretation due to the different language versions of the BIT, and that such issues of interpretation are to be resolved by applying the principles set forth in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties **(\"VCLT\").**\n\n4.5.\n\nArticle 31 of the VCLT, which contains the general rule on treaty interpretation, requires that treaties be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose\".\n\n4.6.\n\nIn cases where the test set forth in Article 31 leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, Article 32 permits consideration of supplementary means of interpretation, such as the preparatory works of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, to confirm or determine the meaning.\n\n4.7.\n\nRespondent points out that the VCLT contains a provision devoted entirely to interpretation issues which arise when treaties are executed in different languages. Article 33 provides:\n\n*\"Interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages*\n\n*1. When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language,* *unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.*\n\n*2. A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the text was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides or the parties so agree.*\n\n*3. The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.*\n\n*4. Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted\".23*\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, art. 33, May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331.\n\n4.8.\n\nRespondent argues that the BIT was done in four languages: Turkish, English, Russian and Turkmen, each of which is authentic.\n\n4.9.\n\n\"Authentification\" is defined in Article 10 of the VCLT and includes signature by the state parties, or any other procedure provided for in the treaty or agreed to by the State Parties.\n\n4.10.\n\nRespondent\u2019s case focuses on the Russian, English and Turkish versions of the BIT. Respondent says that the Russian version is authentic by virtue of the fact that it was executed by the Parties and also because it expressly refers to \"authentic copies in the Turkish, Turkmen, English and Russian language\".24\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission 1 August 2011, para. 17, citing Exhibit R-l.\n\n4.11.\n\nThe English version of the BIT is authentic by virtue of the fact that it was executed by the Parties and states that English as well as Russian are authentic languages. However, it argues that Claimant\u2019s reliance on its construction of the English version is untenable, given that it recognises that the Russian version as authentic, and the Russian version recognises the Turkish version as authentic. In addition, Respondent argues that since English is a language that is foreign to both Turkmenistan and Turkey, it is unlikely that the English version best reflects the intent of the parties. Rather, it is contended that the Turkish version was undoubtedly the original text that was discussed in negotiations and agreed by the Parties.25\n\nDr. Oktem and Dr. Karli argue that the Turkish version was the model text supplied by Turkey for the BITs that were simultaneously being negotiated with the four Turkic States. The Turkish version of all those treaties are virtually identical versions. Thus, given the linguistic similarity between Turkish and Turkmen, it is most probable that the BIT between Turkey and Turkmenistan was negotiated in Turkish and thus the Turkish version is the original text negotiated and agreed by the parties.\n\n4.12.\n\nThe Turkish version of the BIT is said to be authentic by reason of the fact that the Russian version expressly refers to the Turkish version as one of the \"authentic copies\". It thus qualifies as authentic by reason of Article 33(2) of the VCLT, because it was designated as such by the Contracting Parties to the treaty. In addition, the Turkish version of the treaty found on the Undersecretariat\u2019s website in early July 2011 is reported by \u00d4ktem and Karli to list Turkish, Russian and English as authentic languages.26\n\nIn its letter to the Tribunal of 17 January 2012, in response to Claimant\u2019s letter of the same date, Respondent accepts that the Turkish version of the BIT that is currently on the Turkish government\u2019s website does not refer to an authentic version of the BIT in English. It leaves it to \"the appreciation of the Tribunal\" as to why the Turkish government changed the Turkish version on its website following Respondent\u2019s filing of its 15 August 2011 submissions.\n\n4.13.\n\nRelying on Dr. \u00d4ktem and Dr. Karli, Respondent also argues that Turkey has designated Turkish as an authentic language for every investment treaty which it has entered into, except where English has been designated as the sole authentic language and, thus, that there are no Turkish BITs in which the language of the other State is designated as authentic, but Turkish is not so designated.\n\n4.14.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant\u2019s suggestion that the Russian version of the BIT \"expressly state[s] that there are only two authentic versions of the BIT,\" one in Russian and one in English.27 Respondent argues that the phrase \"two authentic copies\" in the Russian version means that the BIT was executed \"... in two authentic physical copies each of the Turkish, Turkmen, English and Russian versions\".28 Providing for two copies in each language would permit each of the two parties to have an executed copy in each of the four languages, which makes simple good sense. Moreover, while there is no indication of priority in the text of the BIT, Turkish comes first, and it would seem highly implausible that an inauthentic language would be mentioned first. Finally, Respondent contends that the use of the word \"copy\" in each of the treaties relied on by Claimant, refers not to the number of official versions or languages of the treaties, but rather to the number of physical copies made of each of these official versions in each of its official languages.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission of 15 August 2011, para 19, citing to Claimant\u2019s submission of 1 August 2011, para. 3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission of 15 August 2011, para. 19.\n\n***Accurate Translations into English of Authentic Versions of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.15.\n\nRespondent submitted certified English translations of the Russian (an initial and a revised version) and Turkish texts of the BIT. It notes that a Turkmen version of the BIT could not be found.\n\n4.16.\n\nThe \"official\" Turkish version of the BIT, as published in the Official Gazette on 15 January 1995 (in certified English translation), provides:\n\n*\"2. In the event that these disputes cannot be settled within six months following the date of the written notification stated in paragraph 1 above, such dispute can be submitted to the below stated International Judicial Authorities as per the decision of the investor; provided that the investor has brought the subject matter of the dispute to the judicial court of the host Party in accordance with the procedures and laws of the host Party and that a decision has not been rendered within one year:*\n\n*(a) \u2026*\n\n*(b)...*\n\n*(c)... \"29*\n\nExhibit R-3.\n\n4.17.\n\nRespondent says that Claimant provided an incorrect Turkish text of Article VII.2 in its letter concerning bifurcation dated 25 April 2011, which it translated in pertinent part as follows:\n\n*\"... if the investor has brought the subject matter of the dispute to the judicial court of the host Party in accordance with the procedures and laws of the host Party and if a decision has not been rendered within one year.\"30*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission of 1 August 2011, para. 28.\n\n4.18.\n\nThe first certified English translation of the Russian version of the BIT proposed by Respondent (R-l) reads in pertinent part as follows:\n\n*\"2.

If the referenced conflicts cannot be settled in this way within six months following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the conflict may be submitted at investor\u2019s choice to*\n\n*(a)...*\n\n*(b)...*\n\n*(c) The Court of Arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce, on the condition that the concerned investor submitted the conflict to the court of the Party, that is a Party to the conflict, and a final arbitral award on compensation of damages has not been rendered within one year.\"*\n\n4.20.\n\nThe only change made to the initial translation - the removal of the word \"if\u2019 following the words \"on the condition that,\" in sub-paragraph (c), - was explained by the translators in their covering letter to counsel for Respondent in the following terms:\n\n*\"Please be advised that in our translation dated July 30, 2011 into English of the Russian version of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, we translated to the best of the translator\u2019s knowledge and ability, the following segment of Article VII.2 of the BIT:*\n\n*[Russian text ofpertinent part of VII.2 (c)]*\n\n*into English as follows:*\n\n*\u2018on the condition that, if* *the concerned investor submitted the conflict to the court of the Party, that is a Party to the conflict, and a final arbitral award on compensation of damages has not been rendered within one year. \u2019*\n\n*The above translation is a literal translation of the words in Russian in the order in which they appear in the Russian text.* *However, it does not accurately reflect the meaning of the Russian version of this segment of Article VII.2 of the BIT. The correct meaning of the above quoted text of the Russian version of the BIT is:*\n\n*\u2018* *on the condition that* *the concerned investor submitted the conflict to the court of the Party, that is a Party to the conflict,* *and a final arbitral award on compensation of damages has not been rendered within one year. \u2019*\n\n*This is because the phrase \u2018...[ Russian text ]... which literally reads word-by word in Russian \u2018... on the condition that, if\u2019 is used in order to make the sentence conditional but should correctly be translated as \u2018... on the condition that\u2019 to properly convey the meaning. The \u2018if\u2019 in the Russian text is part of the correct syntax needed in Russian to create the conditional, but it does not create a second or separate conditional. In fact, the complete phrase \u2019... [Russian text]* *... \u2019 is used in Russian as a single expression to mean \u2018on the condition that \u2019 or \u2018if\u2019.*\n\n*We are therefore providing you with a revised translation in which that change, and only that change, has been made.\"*\n\n***Meaning and Effect of Article VII.2***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n4.21.\n\nRespondent contends that where there are textual differences in treaties done in multiple languages, the VCTL (Article 33) requires that \"the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.\"31 Turkmenistan maintains that, notwithstanding the different phrasing of Article VII.2 in each of the English, Russian and Turkish versions of the treaty, a clear intention can be gleaned that the parties contemplated submission of a dispute to international arbitration only after the investor had submitted it to the national courts of the host state, and a period of one year had been allowed for a decision.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Submission of 15 August 2011, para. 24.\n\n4.22.\n\nThis interpretation is said to accord with the \"ordinary meaning\" of the text of Article VII.2. The Phrase \"provided that\" used in the Turkish and English versions and the phrase \"on the condition that\" used in the Russian version, clearly means that submission to national courts and the allowance of a one year period for a decision is a condition that has to be fulfilled before recourse to international arbitration. The different placement of the conditional phrase, either at the head or at the conclusion of Article VII.2, is a difference in form rather than substance, and does not change the meaning of the provision.\n\n4.23.\n\nThe addition of the word \"if\u2019 in the English version is said, most likely, to have been a syntactical error, made when the original Turkish text was being translated. Its inclusion in the Russian version, as explained by the translators, is part of the correct syntax to create a condition and does not create a second or separate conditional. In neither case, does it change the meaning of the clause, but rather emphasises and strengthens the prior conditional phrase \"provided that\" / \"on the condition that\".\n\n4.24.\n\nSuch a good faith interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the text of Article VII.2 is said to be consistent with the treaty\u2019s context.\n\n4.25.\n\nRespondent maintains that its construction of the Russian and English texts is supported by the clear (and mandatory) text of Article VII.2 that is contained in the Turkish version. Assuming the Turkish text to be authentic, Respondent asserts that only its construction of the English and Russian texts can be reconciled with the Turkish. Should the Tribunal conclude that only the English and Russian texts are authentic, the ambiguity or obscurity of the English text permits the Tribunal to consider supplementary means of interpretation. These include the \"official\" Turkish version of Article VII.2 as published in the Official Gazette (which is agreed to be mandatory) to confirm its contention as to the meaning of the authentic version of the BIT.\n\n4.26.\n\nWith respect to Mr Kasimcan\u2019s letter and Mrs \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7\u2019s email supporting Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article VII of the BIT, Respondent argues that neither should be given weight. This is because the interpretation by only one party to a treaty is not binding or authoritative. Only a corresponding endorsement of that view by Turkmenistan would constitute an authoritative interpretation as evidence of the intention of the parties to the BIT.\n\n4.27.\n\nRespondent finally relies on the principle of *in dubio mitius,* which posits that, in the case of doubt, treaty obligations must be interpreted restrictively, in deference to the sovereignty of states. Respecting a provision that requires prior submission of a dispute to national courts before a state can be subjected to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration is the correct application of this principle.\n\n**5. TRIBUNAL\u2019S APPROACH TO THE BIT ISSUES**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n5.1.\n\nThe Tribunal starts its analysis by outlining the applicable rules for the establishment of the authentic and definitive text of a treaty, the general rules of treaty interpretation, when supplementary means of interpretation may be employed, and the applicable rules for the interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages.\n\n5.2.\n\nThe Tribunal then deals separately with the three principal substantive issues that require to be determined:\n\n(a) the number of authentic versions of the BIT;\n\n(b) the accurate translation into English of any authentic version of the BIT done in a language other than English; and\n\n(c) the meaning and effect of Article VII.2 of the BIT\n\n**6. AUTHENTICATION AND INTERPRETATION PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO THE BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.1.\n\nThe VCLT establishes the analytical framework, guidelines and rules for the determination of the authenticity of the text of treaties and the interpretation of such texts.\n\n6.2.\n\nTurkmenistan has been a signatory to the VCLT since 2 February 1996.32 Accordingly, the VCLT is applicable to Turkmenistan.\n\n*See* Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties, May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331, Multilateral Treaties Deposited with the Secretary General, XXIII -1,2.\n\n6.3.\n\nTurkey is not a signatory to the VCLT. However, customary international law is part of the applicable law in Turkey.33 Accordingly, the Tribunal proceeds on the basis that the provisions of the VCLT that reflect customary international law are to be treated as part of the Turkish legal system and are applicable to Turkey.\n\nOktem & Karli, Legal Opinion on the 1992 Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, Part Ill.2.b. This is not contested by Claimant\n\n6.4.\n\nArticles 31 through 33 of the VCLT provide for the rules of interpretation of international treaties, and the case law of the International Court of Justice **(\"ICJ\")** confirms that these articles reflect customary international law.34\n\nFor example the ICJ applied Articles 31 and 32 even in cases when one or both parties were not parties to the Convention, on the grounds that these articles reflect customary international law. See *Sovereignty Over Pulau Litigan and Pulau Sipidan, (Indonesia v. Malaysia), 2002 I.C.J. Rep. 625 (December 17),* \u00b637. See also, *Kasikili / Sedudu Island (Botswana / Namibia) 1999 I.C.J. Rep,. 1045 (December 13), \u00b6325* and *LaGrand (Germany v U.S.), 2001, I.C.J. Rep. 466 (June 27), \u00b6IOI,* where the ICJ established that the rules contained in Article 33 also reflected customary international law.\n\n6.5.\n\nIn these circumstances, there being no suggestion by Claimant that the Tribunal ought not to have regard to the principles and rules established by the VCLT, where appropriate its relevant provisions are referred to and used by the Tribunal in its analysis of the three substantive questions below.\n\n**7. NUMBER OF AUTHENTIC VERSIONS OF THE BIT**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n***Ordinary Meaning of the Texts***\n-----------------------------------\n\n7.1.\n\nIt is common ground that both the English and Russian versions of the BIT were signed by the parties on 2 May 1992, and may thus be regarded as authentic versions of the BIT by reason of Article 10(b) of the VCLT.35\n\nArticle 10 of the VCLT provides that: *\"The text of a treaty is established as authentic and definitive: (a) by such procedure as may be provided for in the text or agreed upon by the States participating in its drawing up; or (b) failing such procedure, by the signature, signature add referendum, or initialling by the representatives of those States of the text of the treaty or of the Final Act of a conference incorporating the text.\"*\n\n7.2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s case for the authenticity of the Turkish version of the treaty rests on the fact that the Russian version of the BIT expressly refers to the Turkish version as one of the \"authentic copies\". It is therefore said to qualify as authentic by reason of Article 33(2) of the VCLT, because it was designated as such by the Contracting Parties to the treaty.\n\n7.3.\n\nArticle 33 of the VCLT provides:\n\n*\"Interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages*\n\n*1. When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language,* *unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.*\n\n*2. A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the text was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides or the parties so agree.*\n\n*3. The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.*\n\n*4. Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.\"*\n\n7.4.\n\nClaimant asserts that an initial difficulty with Respondent\u2019s case on this point is that the authentic English version of the BIT provides that the treaty was:\n\n*\"DONE at Ashkabat on the day of May 2, 1992*  *in two authentic copies* *in Russian and English \". (emphasis added)*\n\n7.5.\n\nMoreover, the Russian text also refers to two authentic copies, albeit in four languages.\n\n7.6.\n\nRespondent seeks to explain the apparent difference in the number of authentic versions of the treaty, as referred to in the English and Russian versions, on the basis that the number of \"copies\" in each of the treaties refers not to the number of authentic languages or versions of the treaty, but rather to the number of physical copies made of each of the authentic versions in each of its authentic languages.\n\n7.7.\n\nIn the result, for Respondent, the phrase \"two authentic copies\" in the Russian version means that the BIT was executed \"in two authentic physical copies *each* of the Turkish, Turkmen, English and Russian versions\".\n\n7.8.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that Respondent was unable to produce signed copies of either the Turkish or Turkmen versions of the treaty which it argues were signed by the parties. This suggests that, even if Turkish or Turkmen versions of the BIT were available in Ashgabat on 2 May 1992, they were not executed by the parties. In any event, no such copies are part of the record and there is therefore no evidence to indicate that such versions were actually signed by the parties.\n\n7.9.\n\nHad a Turkish version existed and been signed at that time, one would expect it to have been published in its executed format in the Turkish Official Gazette. However, this did not occur. Moreover, Mr Uslu who is the General Manager of the Undersecretariat (the role of which is to conduct procedures and negotiations concerning such treaties) stated in his report, submitted by Claimant, that \"[t]here is no signed version of the Turkish text for the Turkmenistan-Turkey BIT.\" He also explained that during the negotiations of the BIT, an English draft of the text was used by the Turkish side during the negotiations and that the Russian translation was made in Turkmenistan before the English and Russian versions were signed.\n\n7.10.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that, even if it could be said that the Turkish version of the text should be considered as authentic, on the basis that the authentic Russian version of the treaty so provides or that the parties had so agreed *(i.e.,* pursuant to Article 33 (2) of the VCLT), the question would then turn to the identification of such an authentic text. There is no evidence before the Tribunal as to which, if any, particular Turkish version of the text the Contracting Parties might have been referring to in the Russian version of the BIT.36\n\nThe closest thing to a Turkish version of the BIT that seems, on the evidence before us, to have existed at the time is the Turkish version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT that was signed on 1 May 1992. There is also Mr Uslu\u2019s evidence that the translated Turkish text of the BIT was prepared in Turkey to fulfill the procedural requirements of the approval stage.\n\n7.11.\n\nFinally, Respondent has not produced any copy even of an unsigned version of the allegedly authentic Turkmen version, stating that it has been unable to locate any copy. In the Tribunal\u2019s view this confirms that the evidence points to a conclusion that it is highly unlikely that any Turkmen version was actually ever signed.\n\n***Supplementary Means of Interpretation***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n7.12.\n\nArticle 32 of the VCLT provides that:\n\n*\"Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including preparatory works of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:*\n\n*(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or*\n\n*(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable \"*\n\n7.13.\n\nHere, the ordinary meaning of the text of the Russian version of the BIT concerning the number of authentic languages of the treaty appears to the Tribunal to qualify as \"ambiguous or obscure\". The Tribunal may therefore look at the circumstances of the conclusion of the BIT for assistance on the number of its authentic versions.\n\n7.14.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the BIT include its drafting, execution and adoption. As noted above, the evidence points strongly to the fact that it was only signed in its English and Russian language versions.\n\n7.15.\n\nA conclusion that there are only two authentic texts of the BIT - English and Russian -is further supported by the application of the provisions of Article 33(1) and (4) which provide that:\n\n*\"1. Where a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*4. Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of the authentic text discloses a difference of meaning which the application of* *Article 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the text, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted\":.*\n\n7.16.\n\nHad the Tribunal concluded that it was unable to remove the difference of meaning in the English and Russian text by the application of Articles 31 and 32, it would have reached the same conclusion based on the application of Article 33(4) on the basis that the identification of only the English and Russian texts as authentic is an approach that \"best reconciles\" the divergent texts in the Russian and English versions of the BIT.\n\n**8. ACCURATE TRANSLATIONS INTO ENGLISH OF AUTHENTIC VERSIONS OF THE BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.1.\n\nHaving concluded that the only authentic version of the BIT in a language other than English is the Russian version, the next issue concerns the identification of an accurate translation of the Russian version into English.\n\n8.2.\n\nOne reason for translating the text of the Russian version of the BIT into English is to enable the non-Russian speaking Tribunal to construe properly the Russian text. Had the Tribunal been composed of Russian speakers, such a translation may not have been required. In such circumstances, the Tribunal would have looked to the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the Russian version of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose as required by Article 31(1) of the VCLT. This indicates the importance of the role of an accurate translation in these circumstances, and the need to identify an appropriate translator.\n\n8.3.\n\nUntil Respondent filed R-l (revised) - on 17 January 2012, there was no disagreement as to the accurate translation into English of the Russian text. It was agreed that the certified translation made by Language Innovations, LLC, dated 30 July 2001, was an accurate translation from Russian into English of Article VII.2.\n\n8.4.\n\nA first point may be made that the Tribunal does not accept the proposition made by counsel for Claimant in his closing address, following the receipt of the revised translation, that the parties are still in agreement about the Russian-English translation of Article VII.2. All that was, and is now, agreed is that Respondent\u2019s initial translation of the Russian text constituted a word-for-word, literal, translation of the Russian words used in the text of the treaty.\n\n8.5.\n\nHowever, accurate translation of, for example, a sentence in one language into another, requires something more than a literal and word-for-word translation of each and every word employed in the text that is being translated.\n\n8.6.\n\nThe first definition of the verb \"translate\" found in the Oxford Concise Dictionary, 7th ed. is \"[t]o express the sense of (word, sentence...) in or into another language\".\n\n8.7.\n\nSimilarly, Collins Pocket Dictionary, Canadian edition, defines translate as to \"[t]um from one language into another; interpret\".\n\n8.8.\n\nThe Tribunal thus considers it to be necessary and proper for a translation to convey accurately the complete sense of the Russian text when it is translated into English.\n\n8.9.\n\nIn its letter of January 17, 2012, Respondent\u2019s translator explains that the literal translation it provided in the form of R-l does not accurately reflect the meaning of the Russian version of this segment of Article VII.2 of the BIT *(see* para. 4.20 above). The translator goes on to state that the correct meaning (or sense) of the Russian text is conveyed properly by a translation which removes the word \"if\u2019 from the second line of sub-paragraph (c). This is because the inclusion of the word \"if\u2019 in the Russian text, while part of the correct syntax required in Russian to create the conditional, does not operate to create a second or separate conditional, as the original translation into English (R-l) provided.\n\n8.10.\n\nThe Tribunal is cognizant of the fact that the revised translation was produced only three days before the 20 January 2012 hearing. Equally, however, it recognizes that Respondent offered a plausible explanation for the reasons and timing of the revision. Moreover, Claimant did not object at that time to its introduction. Nor did Claimant request the opportunity, or time, to provide a translation from another expert, or request the attendance of Respondent\u2019s translator at the hearing (or at a later date) for cross-examination.\n\n8.11.\n\nThe matter of the revised translation was addressed by counsel for each of the parties during their closing arguments.\n\n8.12.\n\nCounsel for Respondent explained that Respondent had not submitted the revised translation lightly. It did so, he said, only after asking six Russian-speakers in his office, who knew nothing about the case, to read the relevant passage in Russian and to advise whether resort to local courts prior to arbitration was mandatory or optional. All, he said, advised that it was mandatory. He concluded:\n\n*\"Now, I am not asking you to believe that; I can\u2019t put anything in evidence here. But what I am asking you to do is the following: either to rely upon and accept what the translator in this sworn statement says, that this now gives you the accurate meaning, this mandatory meaning in the Russian; or, if you don\u2019t believe that or don\u2019t feel that that\u2019s sufficient, I would ask you to go out and get a Tribunal-appointed Russian expert to read that, and I tell you in ten minutes or less they will tell you that this language in Russian is mandatory.*\n\n*We are prepared to agree in advance: go ahead and do that, and see what that comes up with. And I predict - - I mean, I would be very surprised if there were any other result, because we asked so many different people and they all, without any hesitation, said that this is clearly mandatory language \".37*\n\nTranscript, *supra* note 1 p.167/21 - 168/11.\n\n8.13.\n\nIn his closing speech, counsel for Claimant dealt briefly with the revised translation of the Russian BIT in terms set out below, but did not address Respondent\u2019s invitation to the Tribunal to retain its own expert:\n\n*\"The Tribunal will have noted that the parties were in agreement on the translation and interpretation of that treaty until a number of days ago.*\n\n*I want to emphasise for the Tribunal that the parties are still in agreement about the translation; what they do not agree about is the interpretation because the translated words say what they say, and there appears to be - - and I\u2019ve heard nothing from the* *respondent\u2019s side to the contrary - - there appears to be agreement that the translation ends up with the English words as the parties have been using up until the most recent submission on the point by the respondent. The difference now is not translation but interpretation, and that\u2019s a meaningful distinction I would put to the Tribunal.\"38*\n\n*Id.* at pp. 173/5- 174/4.\n\n8.14.\n\nHowever, when asked for his own position on Respondent\u2019s proposition that the Tribunal appoint a Russian language expert, Mr Volterra on behalf of Claimant replied that:\n\n*\"I think that would be highly unusual. It would be a strange thing to do just in relation to the Russian text, and not the English text, and not the various Turkish texts. The Claimant has no desire to have further expenditures, and thinks it would be sufficient to have the pleadings of the parties on this point.* *And I say that, Mr President, without having had any time to do more than read the letter sent by the respondent. I\u2019ve been out of the country and doing other things, so this is not an informed response.\"39*\n\n*Id.* at p. 184/13-24.\n\n8.15.\n\nThe Tribunal indicated to counsel for Claimant that it might come back to him, and give him additional time to consider the matter.\n\n8.16.\n\nFollowing the hearing, on 22 February 2012, the Tribunal wrote to the parties to advise that having regard to: (a) the continuing uncertainty as to the accuracy of the translations into English of the Russian text of Article VII.2; and (b) the possible relevance of the translation into English of the Turkish version of Article VII.2 (as published in the Official Gazette), the Tribunal had decided to request two independent and qualified expert translators to provide it with English language translations of the relevant texts. The parties were provided with CVs for the proposed experts as well as the proposed instructions they were to receive. The Tribunal further advised that the parties would be given a reasonable opportunity to comment on such translations once they were in hand, and that the Tribunal would welcome comments, if any, on the Tribunal\u2019s intended instructions and on the choice of translators.\n\n8.17.\n\nOn 27 February 2012, counsel for Respondent responded to the Tribunal with the proposal that the Tribunal\u2019s translator also be asked the following question:\n\n*\"Does the Russian phrase, \u2018pri uslovii, esli\u2019, when used in a sentence create a double conditional or is it a construct that is used to create a single conditional the way either the words \u2018on the condition that\u2019, or the word \u2018if\u2019 create in the English language? \"*\n\n8.18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s counsel had no comment or objection with respect to the proposed Russian translator, but raised a question concerning the proposed Turkish translator.\n\n8.19.\n\nOn 28 February 2012, counsel for Claimant responded to the Tribunal. With respect to the proposed retainer of a Russian expert by the Tribunal, counsel wrote:\n\n*\"The Claimant reiterates for the avoidance of doubt that it does not agree to the Tribunal taking up the Respondent\u2019s proposal on this point.\"*\n\nHe continued:\n\n*\"If the Tribunal insists on taking up the Respondent\u2019s proposal, as appears to be the case, the Claimant has the following observations:*\n\n*1. the Respondent alone should pay for this exercise;*\n\n\u2026\n\n*4. the Claimant objects to the Respondent\u2019s request that the Russian-English translator be asked not only to provide the translation of the text of Article 7 (2) of the BIT but also to give an opinion on, or make an interpretation in relation to, certain Russian words. It is notable that the Respondent does not seek to pretend that what it is asking for is a translation. It goes without saying that opinions and interpretations are not translations. It would not be appropriate in relation to the stated objective of the Tribunal in this exercise for the Tribunal to accede to the Respondent\u2019s request.\"*\n\n8.20.\n\nHaving regard to the responses of the parties to the Tribunal\u2019s proposal to instruct independent translators, including Claimant\u2019s objection, the Tribunal advised the parties that it would, for the time being, proceed to decide the BIT Issues on the present record, whilst reserving the right to instruct independent translators if considered necessary.\n\n8.21.\n\nIn proceeding on this basis, the Tribunal notes that the revised translation provided by Respondent provides additional evidence before the Tribunal on the Russian sense *(i.e.,* the accurate translation into English of the Russian) of the Russian text version of Article VII.2.\n\n8.22.\n\nAccordingly, based on the explanation provided by Respondent\u2019s translators for the revisions of their original translation (which it accepts as reasonable), the Tribunal concludes that the accurate translation of the authentic Russian text of Article VII.2 of the BIT for present purposes *(i.e.,* the one that conveys its true sense in Russian) is that set out in R-l (revised). That is to say, a translation that has the word \"if\u2019 removed from the second line of sub-paragraph (c). In the view of the Tribunal, this more accurately conveys in the English language the sense of the Russian text.\n\n8.23.\n\nThe remaining task for the Tribunal (addressed in the next Section below) is therefore to determine the meaning and effect of the authentic Russian and English texts of the BIT, having regard to the applicable provisions of the VCLT and, of course, the submissions of the parties.\n\n**9. MEANING AND EFFECT OF ARTICLE VII.2 OF THE BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n9.1.\n\nThe competing positions of the parties on the meaning and effect of Article VII.2 of the BIT are: for Claimant, the provision is to be interpreted as meaning that the prior submission of the dispute to local courts before the initiation of arbitration proceedings is optional; for Respondent, the provision means that the prior submission of the dispute to local courts before the initiation of arbitration proceedings is mandatory.\n\n9.2.\n\nThese positions require to be assessed by consideration of the Russian and English texts of Article VII. 2, being the only two authentic versions of the text of the BIT.\n\n***The Russian Text***\n----------------------\n\n9.3.\n\nLooking first at the Russian text, in what the Tribunal has found to be its accurate English translation (R-l revised), no difficulties appear to arise. There is only one ordinary meaning of the relevant words found in sub-paragraph (c) (\"..., on the condition that the concerned investor submitted the conflict to the court of the Party, that is a party to the conflict, and a final award of compensation of damages has not been rendered within one year.\"). The ordinary meaning of these words in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the treaty requires the submission of the dispute to local courts prior to the initiation of arbitration proceedings, whether before ICSID, \"ad hoc\" (in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules), or before the ICC Court of Arbitration in Paris.\n\n***The English Text***\n----------------------\n\n9.4.\n\nTurning to the authentic English version of Article VII.2, Claimant seeks support for its position *(i.e.,* that the plain meaning of the words is to provide an option to the investor either to pursue resolution before the Respondent\u2019s domestic courts or to proceed straight to arbitration) from statements made by Mr Kasimcan and Mrs \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7 and the decisions of the *Rumeli* and *Sistem* tribunals.\n\n9.5.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that neither the statements nor the decisions are dispositive or persuasive.\n\n9.6.\n\nMrs \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7\u2019s email to Claimant of 7 July 2011, states that:\n\n*\"... it is not true to translate the Turkish Text as if it mean the Mandatory requirement to apply local Turkmen courts, because it clearly states \u2018IF the investor has gone to the local court but the decision could not be rendered within 1 year then he can apply to international arbitration\u2019\".*\n\n9.7.\n\nThe difficulty with this statement, which limits its value, is that the certified English translation of the \"official\" Turkish text (Exhibit R-3, provided by Respondent and not contested by Claimant) does not contain the word \"if\u2019. The absence of the word \"if\u2019 has the effect of making mandatory the requirement of recourse \"to the judicial court of the host Party\". The text provides in relevant part:\n\n*\"In the event that these disputes cannot be settled within six months following... such dispute can be submitted to the below stated International Judicial Authorities as per the decision of the investor; provided that the investor has brought the subject matter of the dispute to the judicial court of the host Party in accordance with the procedures and laws of the host Party and that a decision has not been rendered within one year.\"*\n\n9.8.\n\nMr Kasimcan\u2019s report of 22 July 2011 also contains the same approach with respect to the accurate text of the Turkish version of the BIT, writing in the word \"if\u2019. For this reason the Tribunal finds the view there expressed to lack persuasive authority.\n\n9.9.\n\nAs regard prior arbitral awards, the Tribunal considers that the *Rumeli* decision is also unpersuasive.40 The *Rumeli* tribunal concluded that the English and Russian versions of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT did not require a prior submission of the dispute to local courts. However, the tribunal in that case simply states this in conclusory terms: it provides no analysis or reasoning in support of that conclusion. Moreover, the tribunal\u2019s reasoning in that case seems to have disregarded the Turkish text, which in that case was authentic, and plainly imposed a mandatory requirement to have recourse to the local courts.41 It is not immediately apparent to the Tribunal in the present case that the *Rumeli* tribunal\u2019s reliance on the English and Russian versions alone is consistent with the requirements of Articles 33(1) and (4) of the VCLT. It may be that the *Rumeli* tribunal had a reasoned basis for excluding the Turkish text, but it does not appear to have set out that reasoning in its award.\n\nMr Stephen, counsel for Claimant, rightly agreed that the reasoning in *Rumeli* was not entirely helpful. *See* Transcript, *supra* note 1, p. 73/5 - 10.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Claimant\u2019s argument that the \"official\" Turkish version of the BIT was mistranslated. The Tribunal reaches this conclusion having regard to the mandatory Russian text of the BIT and because of the identity of the \"official\" Turkish text with the authentic Turkish text in the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT.\n\n9.10.\n\nWith respect to the award in the *Sistem* case, where the tribunal concluded that a claimant is not obliged to seek local remedies prior to turning to arbitration, the Tribunal in the present case does not see a sufficient basis in the *Sistem* award to support the proposition for which Claimant argues in the present case.\n\n9.11.\n\nThe relevant parts of the *Sistem* award provide:\n\n*\"The Respondent takes the view that the words \u2018provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been rendered within one year \u2019 in Article VII.2(2) apply only to Article VII.2(2)(c)[of the BIT].\"42*\n\nThe Tribunal then concludes that it:\n\n*\"take[s] no position on the question because Sistem has not instituted any proceedings in the national courts against the Krygyz Republic.\"*\n\n*Sistem, supra* note 21, para 106.\n\n9.12.\n\nA difficulty with reliance on the conclusion of that tribunal in the present case is that the *Sistem* tribunal\u2019s latter statement makes little sense when taken on its own. It may be that what the tribunal meant to say \"because *Sistem* has not brought a case to the ICC.\"43\n\nArticle VII.2(2)(c) of the relevant BIT relates to the submission of disputes to the ICC Court of Arbitration in Paris.\n\n9.13.\n\nIf this is right, the *Sistem* decision is of little persuasive value. It appears from the account of the *Sistem* case that the respondent there did not raise the same argument as the Respondent in the present case. It appears from the award that the *Sistem* tribunal did not consider the question that is before this Tribunal and disposed of the matter on a different basis, having regard to the different arguments of the parties.\n\n***Meaning of the English Version is Ambiguous and/or Obscure***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.14.\n\nRespondent describes the English text as grammatically awkward, and says that the phrasing is mangled and non-sensical. The Tribunal agrees that the phrasing of the English is grammatically incorrect. Not only is it inelegant, as was conceded by Claimant, but the pertinent part of Article VII.2 contains a single word which does not immediately appear that it ought to be present, and would not be present if the text had been drafted by a native speaker. There are two different single words that might be removed: the word \"if\u2019 could be removed (after which the relevant text would read \"provided that, the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts... and a final award has not been rendered in one year.\"), or the word \"and\" could removed (after which the relevant text would read \"provided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts... a final award has not been rendered in one year.\"). On either approach, the removal of one of those two words (but not both) would give the phrase grammatical coherence. An issue that arises is which, if any, of the two words might be removed.\n\n9.15.\n\nProfessor Komfilt, expert on linguistics, testified with considerable clarity and persuasiveness, that one would normally not expect two conditionals together (\"provided that\" followed by \"if\u2019), which is the only way one gets to an \"optional\" text. On the other hand, the conjunctive, \"and\", has no business in any text, unless the local court provision is mandatory.\n\n9.16.\n\nWhen questioned by Professor Park as to whether any linguistic principle would suggest the removal of one of the extra words in preference to the other, Professor Komfilt said that while she might not be able to formulate a principle she felt that:\n\n*\"leaving out the \"if\" would be preferable to leaving out the \"and\", because there is already a bit of text, namely the \"provided that\", which is a conditional... just the way \"if\" is also a conditional.*\n\n*So this is why I would tend to, I would lean towards a solution towards well-formedness that would leave out the \"if\" and retain the \"provided that\" as the only conditional, and leave in the \"and\", therefore, as under the two options you gave me.\"44*\n\nHer evidence has not been challenged by Claimant.45\n\nTranscript, *supra* note 1 p. 154/9-18.\n\nAlthough Professor Komfilt was speaking here about the English version of the Russian text, as translated literally, her testimony applies equally to the authentic English text of Article VII.2.\n\n9.17.\n\nIn the event, the Tribunal concludes that attempting to interpret the relevant English text in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT leaves its meaning ambiguous or obscure. In these circumstances, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to consider supplementary means of interpretation as permitted under Article 32 of the VCLT.\n\n***Supplementary Means of Interpretation***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n9.18.\n\nOne supplementary means of interpretation is to consider the circumstances of the conclusion of the BIT. The circumstances include the process relating to the negotiation, conclusion and signing of the BIT in Ashgabat on 2 May 1992, as well as events leading up to its ratification.46\n\nTranscript, *supra* note 1 pp. 137/5 - 138/19.\n\n9.19.\n\nAmongst these circumstances, the Tribunal notes that Turkey entered into four treaties with the Turkick States within a very short period of time, namely five days, in late April / early May 1992. Each of these four treaties included authentic English versions, and each such version includes substantially identical provisions as those that are to be found in Article VII.2 of the BIT. In addition, the authentic Turkish text of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT, which was entered into just one day before the BIT, contains substantially identical terms *(i.e.,* requiring mandatory recourse to the local courts) as those found in the official Turkish text of the BIT that was published in Turkey\u2019s Official Gazette on 15 January 1995.47\n\nThe Turkish legal experts for both parties agree on this point.\n\n9.20.\n\nThe Tribunal is bound to note a convergence on a mandatory recourse to the local courts in: (a) the authentic Russian text of the BIT (R-l, revised); (b) the authentic Turkish text of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT, which employs the same text as Article VII.2 of the BIT; and (c) the official English-Turkish translation of Article VII of the BIT that was published in Turkey\u2019s Official Gazette. Against that, the only text that can be said to point against the mandatory recourse to the local courts is the authentic text of the English version of the BIT.\n\n9.21.\n\nThese circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the BIT lead the Tribunal to conclude that the better view is that the English language version of Article VII.2 is properly to be interpreted as requiring mandatory recourse to the local courts.48 This view best reconciles the interpretation of the texts, having regard to the circumstances surrounding their adoption. The contrary view does not appear to find support in other circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the BIT.\n\nThe Tribunal does not disregard Exhibit EO/MK-15, the Council of Ministers\u2019 letter to the Turkish Parliament, which described Article VII in terms which support the meaning of the relevant text as being optional. However, such a memorandum describing the draft Law on the Approbation of the Approval of the BIT is trumped by the subsequent publication in the Official Gazette of the \"official\" Turkish translation of the authentic English version of the BIT in terms which are unquestionably mandatory.\n\n***Only a Mandatory Meaning Reconciles the Two Authentic Texts***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.22.\n\nTo the extent that it might not be possible to resolve the possible difference in meaning of the English and Russian text through the application of Articles 31 and 32, the Tribunal can, in accordance with the principles reflected in Article 33(4) of the VCLT, adopt the meaning which would best reconcile the two texts.\n\n9.23.\n\nTo the extent that this had been necessary - and the Tribunal concludes that it is not -the Tribunal would have had no hesitation in concluding that the ambiguity of the English text could only be reconciled with the clearly mandatory Russian text by the determination that the English text also required a mandatory recourse to the local courts. This follows, because what is plainly mandatory cannot be optional, but what may either be mandatory or optional, can be seen as mandatory.\n\n***The Effect of a Mandatory Text***\n------------------------------------\n\n9.24.\n\nIn each of its written submissions on the BIT Issues, Respondent reserved its rights to develop further its jurisdictional arguments. However, at the 20 January hearing, in its opening and closing submissions, counsel for Respondent formally requested the Tribunal to dismiss the case in its entirety for lack of jurisdiction if it concluded that pursuant to Article VII.2, as properly construed, a prior submission of the dispute to local courts was mandatory before ICSID arbitration proceedings could properly be instituted.\n\n9.25.\n\nCounsel for Claimant responded to this request in his closing submissions. After noting certain complaints Claimant had previously made in relation to the proceedings prior to the hearing, he observed:\n\n*\"... [T]here was a formal request put forward by the [R]espondent that the Tribunal promptly dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the claim of the claimant after this hearing.*\n\n*... But what is the Tribunal going to do now? There is an issue before it* [the Tribunal] *which could be dispositive on the jurisdictional basis of the case. Is the Tribunal going to wait until 2013 or 2014 to decide upon it, and waste all of our time and money? Obviously, not. Well, I hope it\u2019s not going to choose to waste all of our time and money.*\n\n*So what does it have to do? Well, obviously it has to render a decision on this point and obviously, as we are going to discuss in a little while, that\u2019s going to have an effect on the schedule for the pleadings, because I don\u2019t want to advise my client that it should proceed with drafting a memorial in a case in which during the course of the writing or shortly thereafter there is going to be a decision that will conclude that there is no jurisdiction of this Tribunal\"49*\n\nTranscript, *supra* note 1. pp. 178/1-4 - 179/2-17.\n\n9.26.\n\nSubject to the procedural concerns that Claimant has raised, it appears to agree with Respondent that a decision on jurisdiction should be made at this stage, insofar as it relates to the meaning and effect of Article VII.2.\n\n9.27.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that on its own case Claimant has not treated Article VII.2 as imposing a mandatory requirement to have recourse to the local courts of Turkmenistan, and states in its written submissions that it \"has chosen not to pursue domestic remedies, instead exercising its rights to commence the current proceedings\".50 There is therefore no dispute that Claimant has not had recourse to the local courts. Moreover, Claimant has stated that its decision not to have recourse to the local was one that it has chosen, and although it has not provided reasons for the exercise of such choice, it has not argued that recourse to the local courts was not available.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission, 1 August 2011, para. 14.\n\n9.28.\n\nNevertheless, and notwithstanding the parties\u2019 apparent consensus that the Tribunal should, if it is able to do so, provide a definitive ruling on its jurisdiction, the Tribunal notes that the parties have not yet provided submissions on the effect of non-compliance with the provisions of Article VII.2 of the BIT, assuming it to require mandatory recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan in the present case.\n\n9.29.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal invites the parties to make submissions, within 10 days of the receipt of this Decision, as to whether they wish to have an opportunity to make written/oral submissions with respect to the consequences to be drawn from Claimant\u2019s non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of Article VII.2.\n\n9.30.\n\nIn the event that the parties wish to do so, the Tribunal will fix a timetable for further submissions on that point.\n\n9.31.\n\nIn the event that the parties do not wish to do so, and are content for the Tribunal to determine its jurisdiction on the basis of Claimant\u2019s admitted non-compliance with the provisions of Article VII.2, the Tribunal will supplement this Decision and issue an Award dismissing jurisdiction.\n\n**10. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n10.1.\n\nAt this stage, the Tribunal takes due note of the parties\u2019 positions and requests with respect to costs. The Tribunal reserves this question for decision at a later stage along with the issuance of an Award.\n\n**11. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S OPERATIVE DECISION**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n11.1.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously **DECIDES AND DECLARES** that:\n\n(a) there are two authentic versions of the BIT, being the English and Russian versions, both signed in Ashkabat on 2 May 1992;\n\n(b) the translation into English of the Russian version of the BIT that is found in Exhibit R-l (revised) is to be treated as accurate;\n\n(c) the meaning and effect of Article VII.2 of the BIT is that a concerned investor is required to submit its dispute to the courts of the Contracting Party with which a dispute has arisen, and must not have received a final award within one year from the date of submission of its case to the local courts, before it can institute arbitration proceedings in one of the fora in the manner permitted by Article VII.2.\n\n(d) the decision on costs is deferred to a later stage of the arbitration."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2013-07-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Separate Opinion of Professor William W. Park", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2013-05-20T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Separate Opinion of Professor William W. Park\n---------------------------------------------\n\nI. Background\n-------------\n\n1.\n\nWith respect to certain construction projects in Turkmenistan, Claimant in December 2009 filed a Request for Arbitration pursuant to the Agreement between Turkey and Turkmenistan Concerning Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"BIT\").\n\n2.\n\nIn pertinent part, Article VII appears below.\n\n(1) Disputes between one of the Parties and one investor of the other Party, in connection with his investment, shall be notified in writing, including a [sic] detailed information, by the investor to the recipient Party of the investment. As far as possible, the investor and the concerned Party shall endeavour to settle these disputes by consultations and negotiations in good faith.\n\n(2) If these disputes [sic] cannot be settled in this way within six months following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the dispute can be submitted, as the investor may choose, to [choice of ICSID, UNCITRAL or ICC] provided that, if [sic] the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and [sic] a final award has not been rendered within one year.\n\n3.\n\nThe first subsection uses the mandatory \"shall\" to impose jurisdictional preconditions requiring notice of the dispute and an endeavor to settle the dispute by negotiation. If settlement proves elusive during a period of six months from notice, the second subsection says that disputes \"can be\" submitted to arbitration, which will go forward if host states have not given final judgment in a year.\n\n4.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration met the six-month waiting period with respect to four construction projects. However, the \"no-judgment-within-a-year\" proviso has not been fulfilled. As an initial matter, therefore, the Tribunal had to consider whether the \"no-judgment-within-a-year\" proviso was optional or mandatory.\n\n5.\n\nAn option to litigate would say that disputes can be arbitrated \"provided that **if** the investor has brought litigation, a final award has not been rendered within one year.\" A mandatory text would say that disputes can be arbitrated \"provided that the investor has brought litigation **and** a final award has not been rendered within one year.\"\n\n6.\n\nThe English version of the BIT combines \"if\" (optional) with \"and\" (mandatory) as follows:\n\n\"Disputes can be submitted [to arbitration] provided that, **if** the investor has brought the dispute [local courts] **and** a final award has not been rendered within one year.\" The Russian text connects the proviso only to ICC arbitration, arguably making it irrelevant to ICSID proceedings. The Tribunal\u2019s task was complicated by arguments invoking treaty texts in Turkish and Turkmen.\n\n7.\n\nEarlier in the proceedings, this Tribunal came to a view that English and Russian, but not Turkish or Turkmen, were authentic treaty texts. Rightly or wrongly, that ruling also said the \"no-judgment-within-a-year\" proviso was mandatory. The word \"if\u2019 was read out of the treaty, in part due to linguistics testimony suggesting pleonastic Russian usage of \"provided that\" (\u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0438) and \"if\u2019 (\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438) to translate as \"on condition that\" an investor files litigation.\n\n8.\n\nNow the Award says the \"no-judgment-in-a-year\" proviso precludes arbitral authority. After three years, the Parties return to where they started. Claimant bears costs despite the undisputedly defective wording of Article VII. Such conclusions run counter to the BIT terms and purpose. The proper course would be to put proceedings into abeyance for a reasonable time to permit filing local litigation. If a timely judgment proves acceptable to the investor, proceedings end. If the investor remains aggrieved, arbitration resumes for claims falling within the scope of the BIT.\n\nII. Consent to Arbitration\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nArticle VII says that a dispute can be submitted to arbitration if not settled through negotiation \"within six months following the date of the written notification.\" When Claimant consented to arbitrate by its Request of December 15, 2009, the host state\u2019s standing offer to arbitrate was met, as to the four relevant projects, according to the terms of that offer, including the notice/settlement period.\n\n10.\n\nNotice of disputes may be given either independently or in connection with local litigation. Claimant elected the former, sending notices and then waiting the requisite six months. Notice was given in early 2009 as follows; (i) sports stadium, by letters of 10 & 16 January, 13 & 16 February, 25 May and 3 June; (ii) Agriculture University, by letter of 16 February; (iii) schools, by letters of 5, 16 & 23 January. 13 & 16 February, and 15 April; and (iv) Ashgabat rcsidential/commcrcial buildings, by letters of 26 March and 5 & 6 June,\n\n11.\n\nThe notices contain information on geological surveys, iron foundations, bitumen isolation, payment terms, penalty percentages and contract identification. In some instances the notices refer to \"Turkmenistan Fortification Law Court\" demonstrating hopes of local court resolution.\n\n12.\n\nThese letters meet the treaty requirements for content as well as for timing. Article VII requires \"detailed information\" about the dispute, but not legal theories derived from treaty provisions, which might reveal themselves only after host state reaction to the notices.\n\nIII. Six Months Means Six Months\n--------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe BIT says disputes \"can be\" submitted to arbitration if not settled within six months from notice.\n\n14.\n\nInterpreting the \"no-judgment-with in-a-year\" proviso as a jurisdictional precondition creates a pathology in which the same sentence purports to permit an investor to commence arbitration six months after notice of the dispute, while simultaneously requiring the investor to wait twelve months from the very same starting point.\n\n15.\n\nPerhaps a special jurisdictional predicate, divorced from the six-month waiting period, might arguably impose itself if the \"no-judgment-wilhin-a-year\" proviso depended on an event other than notice of the same dispute which serves as the starting gun for the right to arbitrate.\n\n16.\n\nSuch is not the case. The English text consistently uses the same term \"dispute\" for all purposes. The Russian displays the same consistency, using \"koh\u00a2uihkt\" (\"conflict\") regardless of whether relief is sought before courts or arbitrators.\n\nIV. Arbitration of BIT Violations\n---------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nInterpreting the \"no-judgment-within-a-year\" proviso as a precondition to arbitral authority means that investors remain without arbitral recourse if denial of treaty rights comes through swift court action. The treaty\u2019s standing offer to arbitrate cannot be accepted because judgment arrives within a year.\n\n18.\n\nConsequently, no arbitral tribunal with any jurisdictional legitimacy can hear claims of treaty violations such as uncompensated expropriation or denial of justice.\n\n19.\n\nNothing in the BIT gives even a hint of intent to limit recourse to arbitration for treaty-based claims. Article VII contains the broadest of language, providing arbitration for all \"\u2018disputes... in connection with\" an investor\u2019s investment,\n\n20.\n\nReading any treaty in a way that defeats its goals, should normally be avoided when a more reasonable construction presents itself. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties directs interpretation of treaties in accordance with the '\u2018ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\" which in this case include promotion of \"a stable framework for investment.\"\n\n21.\n\nTo construe the proviso as a jurisdictional precondition creates anything but such a \"stable framework\" for investment. If arbitration begins before litigation, as in the present case, the claim is dismissed. Yet if litigation precedes arbitration, the claim can be defeated by a swift judgment, since the deemed jurisdictional precondition, the court\u2019s failure to reach decision in a year, cannot be satisfied due to the judgment having arrived before the twelfth month.\n\n22.\n\nThe Award predicts that arbitrators faced with rapid denial of treaty rights will nevertheless hear claims in certain cases. If so, the proviso takes a chameleon-like character barring arbitral authority in certain instances but not others. If the investor in the current proceedings files a second arbitration following a swift judgment denying treaty rights, the claim can be heard only if a new tribunal treats the proviso as something other than the *ab initio* jurisdictional precondition asserted in the Award.\n\n23.\n\nBy contrast, no conflict arises between treaty objectives and the proviso when the \"no-judgment-within-a-year\" rule receives its normal reading as a procedural requirement  not reaching the level of jurisdictional precondition. An arbitral tribunal can be constituted with authority to hear complaints about treaty violations through quick but incorrect decisions.\n\nV. The Wording of Article VII\n-----------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn Article VII, neither the English nor the Russian version gives any hint of merging or amalgamating the jurisdictional quality of the first subsection (mandating that disputes \"shall\" be notified and negotiated) into the permissive second subsection (providing that disputes \"can be\" submitted to arbitration if not settled within six months).\n\n25.\n\nThe treaty language and purpose support reading the \"no-judgment-in-a-year\" proviso as a clause designed to give local courts a chance to resolve disputes whether or not arbitration has already begun.\n\n26.\n\nNeither magic nor mystery attaches to procedural steps that fail to reach the level of preconditions to the creation of arbitral authority.\n\n27.\n\nProcedural flaws that may be cured during the arbitration are often characterized by reference to notions such as ripeness, *recevabilit\u00e9* or admissibility. Such terms derive not from technical treaty definition, but from usage as convenient labels to describe steps to be taken either before or after constitution of a tribunal, even if they must be met prior to merits being addressed.\n\n28.\n\nThese distinctions remain commonplace. Arbitrators often confirm jurisdiction, but proceed to the merits only \"provided that\" Terms of Reference are signed, deposits lodged, and/or settlement mechanisms satisfied. Such requirements may be met after exercise of a right to arbitrate.\n\n29.\n\nFew requirements introduced by \"provided that\" possess an intrinsically jurisdictional quality. Instead, the meaning of a proviso depends on the drafters\u2019 intent as evidenced by context, structure and wording, construed in light of all related factors.\n\n30.\n\nThe present interpretative exercise might yield a different conclusion had the treaty employed other language, such as a statement saying \"investors are entitled to arbitrate only after going to local courts.\" Instead, the BIT says that disputes \"can be submitted\" to arbitration six months after notice. Considered in the context of the totality of Article VII, the \"no-judgment-within-a-year\" proviso cannot be construed as a precondition to arbitral authority without ignoring the ordinary meaning of the BIT\u2019s terms in light of its purpose to allow submission of disputes to arbitration after a six-month notice period."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**1.

Ms A\u00efssatou Diop, ICSID, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n1.2.6.\n\nOn 31 January 2011, the First Tribunal held a first session, alone without the parties, by telephone-conference, in order to meet the time limit for the Tribunal\u2019s first session set forth under Rule 13(1) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n***Objections to Jurisdiction***\n--------------------------------\n\n1.2.7.\n\nOn 11 February 2011, having been made aware of Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and proposal that these proceedings be bifurcated as between jurisdiction and merits, the First Tribunal invited the parties to provide submissions on the issue of the bifurcation of these proceedings.\n\n1.2.8.\n\nOn 22 February 2011, Respondent wrote to the First Tribunal setting out its brief submission on the nature of (but not justifications for) its objections to jurisdiction, as requested in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 11 February 2011.\n\n1.2.9.\n\nOn 2 March 2011, Claimant wrote to the First Tribunal setting out its response to the First Tribunal\u2019s letter of 11 February 2011, and to Respondent\u2019s submission of 22 February 2011.\n\n***First Meeting***\n-------------------\n\n1.2.10.\n\nOn 14 March 2011, the First Tribunal held a procedural consultation with the parties **(\"First Meeting\")** by telephone-conference at 12:00 p.m., Washington, D.C. time.\n\n1.2.11.\n\nDuring the course of the First Meeting, the parties confirmed, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) the rules applicable to this arbitration are the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings as amended as of 10 April 2006 **(\"Rules\");**\n\n(b) the First Tribunal had been constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Rules;\n\n(c) the proceedings would be held in Paris, France; and\n\n(d) the language of the proceedings would be English.\n\n1.2.12.\n\nAs regards the written and oral procedures to be adopted in the arbitration, after hearing each party\u2019s oral presentation, the First Tribunal decided that:\n\n(a) Respondent would have three weeks to elaborate on the nature of each of the five grounds on which it based its objections to jurisdiction;\n\n(b) Claimant would have three weeks thereafter to respond;\n\n(c) in their respective submissions, each party was to provide alternative procedural calendars, one with bifurcation and one without; and\n\n(d) the First Tribunal would then decide on bifurcation.\n\n***The Parties\u2019 Further Comments on Jurisdiction***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1.2.13.\n\nOn 4 April 2011, Respondent provided further observations on the issue of bifurcation of the proceedings and the nature of its objections to jurisdiction, as directed by the Tribunal during the First Meeting.\n\n1.2.14.\n\nOn 25 April 2011, Claimant provided further observations on the issue of bifurcation of the proceedings and set out its response to Respondent\u2019s letter of 4 April 2011, as directed by the Tribunal during the First Meeting.\n\n***The Second Tribunal***\n-------------------------\n\n1.2.15.\n\nOn 2 May 2011, Professor Gaillard resigned from the Tribunal. On 3 May 2011, the Secretary-General notified the parties of the vacancy on the First Tribunal and suspended the proceeding in accordance with Rule 10(2).\n\n1.2.16.\n\nOn 24 May 2011, the First Tribunal was reconstituted **(\"Tribunal\"),** with Professor Park and Professor Sands continuing, and with the appointment, by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID, of Mr J. William Rowley QC (Canada), as its President. In accordance with Rule 12, the proceeding resumed on that same date.\n\n1.2.17.\n\nOn 24 August 2011, the Secretary-General announced to the parties and the Tribunal that Ms Diop would take a temporary leave of absence, and that Ms Mair\u00e9e Uran Bidegain had been designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal during her absence. On 10 January 2012, the Secretary-General informed the parties and the Tribunal that Ms Mair\u00e9e Uran Bidegain would continue serving as Secretary of the Tribunal on a permanent basis.\n\n***Decision on Bifurcation and Early Determination of BIT Issues***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.2.18.\n\nOn 30 June 2011, having considered the parties\u2019 submissions on bifurcation, the Tribunal issued a reasoned decision on bifurcation, declining to direct bifurcation of the proceedings. In reaching this decision, the Tribunal made it clear that it had in no way pre-judged the outcome of any of the jurisdictional objections raised, that Respondent was fully entitled to maintain such objections as it considered appropriate, and that they would be addressed as joined to the merits of the dispute in the manner envisaged by Article 41 of the ICSID Convention. However, having regard to the parties\u2019 differences concerning Article VII.2 of the BIT, and the significance of that issue, the Tribunal considered it would be appropriate, at an early stage, to determine:\n\n(a) the number of authentic versions of the BIT; and\n\n(b) to the extent there are authentic version(s) of the BIT in languages other than English - accurate translations into English of any authentic version(s) of the BIT.\n\n1.2.19.\n\nMindful of the need for early resolution of these issues in order to avoid unnecessary cost and argument later in the proceedings, the Tribunal also indicated that it wished to explore further the meaning and effect of Article VII.2 of the BIT.\n\n1.2.20.\n\nHaving also considered the parties\u2019 respective proposed timetables, and bearing in mind that the case was registered with the Centre some 15 months earlier, the Tribunal established the timetable for the case, fixing all procedural steps up to and including the production of a hearing bundle on 29 October 2012. The hearing date was to be fixed at a later date.\n\n1.2.21.\n\nAs regards its questions concerning Article VII.2 of the BIT, referred to at 1.2.18-19 above **(\"BIT Issues\"),** the timetable provided for two rounds of simultaneous written submissions as follows:\n\n(a) by 1 August 2011, submissions on what constitutes authentic versions/accurate English translation(s) of the BIT, as well as the meaning and effect of Article VII.2, together with documentary testimonial or expert evidence relied upon; and\n\n(b) by 15 August 2011, simultaneous reply submissions on what constitutes authentic versions/accurate English translation(s) of the BIT, as well as the meaning and effect of Article VII.2, together with documentary, testimonial or expert evidence relied upon.\n\n***Subsequent Procedural Matters***\n-----------------------------------\n\n1.2.22.\n\nOn 13 July 2011, Claimant requested that the procedural calendar be extended by an additional step, to allow it to file a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction if Respondent submits its objections to jurisdiction with its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (making that pleading Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction).\n\n1.2.23.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal invited Respondent to submit its comments, if any, on Claimant\u2019s request by 18 July 2011, which Respondent provided in due course.\n\n1.2.24.\n\nOn 1 August 2011, the parties exchanged written submissions on the BIT Issues. Claimant\u2019s submission was supported by an email to Claimant from Mrs Zergul \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7, a report from Mr Fuat Kasimcan and an expert report from Professor Yusuf \u00c7ali\u00a7kan. Respondent\u2019s submission was supported by a legal opinion from Dr Emre \u00d4ktem and Dr Mehmet Karli.\n\n1.2.25.\n\nOn 15 August 2011, the parties exchanged written reply submissions on the BIT Issues. Claimant\u2019s submission was supported by a report from Mr Ibrahim Uslu. Respondent\u2019s submission was supported by a second legal opinion from Dr \u00d4ktem and Dr Karli and an expert report from Professor Jaklin Komfilt.\n\n1.2.26.\n\nOn 8 September 2011, following consultation with the parties, and with their agreement, the Tribunal fixed the dates of 14-18 January 2013 for the oral hearing on the merits and jurisdiction - the hearing to take place at the World Bank\u2019s facilities in Paris, France.\n\n1.2.27.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal advised the parties that, unless they were content that the BIT Issues should be decided on the papers, the Tribunal considered that a one-day, in-person, oral hearing would be of assistance, to be attended by counsel and the parties\u2019 legal experts.\n\n1.2.28.\n\nThe Tribunal also advised the parties that, having considered the parties\u2019 submissions regarding Claimant\u2019s application to add a final (fifth) Memorial/pleading four weeks after Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder Memorial, it was not, for the moment, disposed to add the requested fifth memorial. The Tribunal noted that this was not a case in which jurisdictional objections would appear suddenly in the Counter-Memorial (Claimant having already been made aware of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections through two sets of written exchanges). In these circumstances, the Tribunal noted that Claimant would be in a position to deal initially with Respondent\u2019s objections, to the extent that it wished, in its Memorial. However, should it turn out that any new objections were raised for the first time in Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, the matter could be revisited.\n\n1.2.29.\n\nOn 15 September 2011, the parties commented on the Tribunal\u2019s suggestion to hold a one-day hearing on the BIT Issues.\n\n1.2.30.\n\nOn 23 September 2011, having considered the parties\u2019 comments, the Tribunal fixed 17 January 2012 for a one-day hearing in London, United Kingdom, on the BIT Issues. At the same time, it confirmed Paris, France, as the place for the substantive hearing on 14-18 January 2013. The parties were also invited to discuss, with a view to agreeing, a proposal on the approach to/time allocation for the hearing on the BIT Issues.\n\n1.2.31.\n\nHaving been advised shortly thereafter of Mr Volterra\u2019s unavailability on 17 January 2012, and having confirmed the availability of all counsel, and their experts, on 20 January 2012, the Tribunal requested the parties to block 20 January 2012 for the BIT Issues hearing.\n\n1.2.32.\n\nOn 3 October 2011, Claimant wrote to the Centre stating that Mr Fatih Serbest had been dismissed as counsel of record for Claimant in the case.\n\n1.2.33.\n\nOn 4 October 2011, the Tribunal advised the parties that the hearing on BIT Issues in London, United Kingdom, was confirmed for 20 January 2012, starting at 10:00 a.m.\n\n1.2.34.\n\nOn that same date, Claimant advised the Centre that it had appointed Ms Yasemin \u00c7etinel to act on its behalf as its legal representative along with Volterra Fietta (which firm had been on record from the start) in these proceedings.\n\n1.2.35.\n\nOn 24 October 2011, Claimant advised the Centre that the parties had agreed to amend the pleading schedule set out in the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1 of 30 June 2011, which agreement, amongst other things, would lead to a new hearing date - June 2013 being suggested. The parties requested the Tribunal to endorse this agreed schedule. Respondent agreed with the content of Claimant\u2019s communication on 25 October 2011.\n\n1.2.36.\n\nOn 4 November 2011, the Tribunal advised the parties that it was in general agreement with the new proposed timetable and confirmed its availability for a five-day hearing in Paris, France, commencing on 17 June 2013. The parties were also advised that their proposed new schedule was problematic with respect to the timetable for disclosure of documents. The parties were therefore requested to propose a slight adjustment. Once a new proposal had been agreed, the Tribunal indicated it would be pleased to consider it for endorsement.\n\n1.2.37.\n\nBy correspondence dated 2 November 2011, 25 November 2011 and 30 November 2011, the parties provided their proposals for the conduct of the 20 January 2012 BIT Issues hearing. Respondent proposed, *inter alia,* that the hearing should focus on what the experts had to say. It favoured expert conferencing with the parties\u2019 legal experts, and suggested that its linguistic expert, Professor Komfilt, attend for examination and subsequent questioning by Claimant. Claimant indicated that it did not require any of Respondent\u2019s experts to attend the hearing to be cross-examined and thus did not see the need for them to attend. Claimant also noted that Respondent had declined to request that Claimant make available any of its experts for cross-examination.\n\n1.2.38.\n\nOn 11 December 2011, the Tribunal advised the parties, *inter alia,* that it continued to feel that it would be helpful for the parties\u2019 legal experts to attend the hearing to enable the members of the Tribunal to raise questions directly with them. Accordingly, the Tribunal invited the parties to arrange for the attendance of their respective legal experts at the 20 January 2012 hearing. Since neither party had notified the other that it required the other parties\u2019 expert(s) for cross-examination, the Tribunal proposed that the legal experts appear together, to respond to such questions as the Tribunal might have. Counsel for the parties would then have the opportunity to ask questions arising from the answers given to the Tribunal\u2019s questions. Respondent was also invited to have its linguistic expert available by video-conference facility, against the event the Tribunal had questions.\n\n1.2.39.\n\nOn 13 December 2011, Respondent advised the Tribunal that it objected to the attendance of Mr Kasimcan, Mrs \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7 and Mr Uslu, stating that the Tribunal had only required the legal experts to attend and these experts did not fit in such category, and that the appearance of these three officials of the Government of the Republic of Turkey, would contravene Article 27 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n1.2.40.\n\nOn 19 December 2011, following further correspondence with the parties relating to the conduct of the 20 January 2012 hearing, the Tribunal advised that there would be an opportunity for counsel to make brief opening statements, following which the experts were requested to be available for questions (there would be no need for introductory statements, or testimony in chief), following which there would be an opportunity for counsel to make brief closing statements.\n\n1.2.41.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s objection to the attendance of Mr Kasimcan, Mrs \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7 and Mr Uslu, based on Article 27 of the Convention, the Tribunal clarified that, when it issued its 11 December 2011 invitation, it principally had in mind the attendance (for Claimant) of Professor \u00c7ali\u00a7kan. Nevertheless, it advised that it did not consider Respondent\u2019s objection to be well founded and that, if Claimant wished them to attend, they might do so. If they did, and should the Tribunal question any of them, counsel would be given the opportunity to ask follow-up questions.\n\n1.2.42.\n\nOn 23 December 2011, following further correspondence from the parties in which *inter alia,* Claimant did not state that it wished Mr Kasimcan, Mrs \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7 and Mr Uslu to attend, the Tribunal confirmed that it did not feel that the attendance of the three officials would be sufficiently helpful as to warrant their travel to London, United Kingdom.\n\n1.2.43.\n\nOn that same date, Claimant advised the Tribunal that the parties had agreed to a further amendment of the pleading schedule. Whilst the proposed amendment would not affect the 20 January 2012 BIT Issues hearing, it would affect the planned merits/jurisdictional hearing of 14-18 June 2013. Amongst other things, a new hearing date was suggested for October 2013.\n\n1.2.44.\n\nOn 5 January 2012, following a number of exchanges between the Tribunal and the parties on the proposed new schedule, the Tribunal advised the parties that it would be sensible to discuss these matters in person, and to fix a new schedule that worked for all concerned during the hearing in London, United Kingdom, on 20 January 2012.\n\n1.2.45.\n\nOn 17 January 2012, Claimant wrote to the Centre, denying Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Turkish version of the BIT published on the Turkish Undersecretariat of the Treasury\u2019s website states that Turkish is one of the authentic languages in which the BIT was executed. A copy of the Turkish version of the BIT as downloaded from the website was attached.\n\n1.2.46.\n\nOn the same day, Respondent wrote to the Centre:\n\n(a) providing a revised certified translation into English of the authentic Russian version of the BIT (Exhibit R-l (revised)), with a letter from the translators explaining the reason for the submission of the revised translation; and\n\n(b) advising that the Turkish version of the BIT that was on the Under-Secretariat\u2019s website in early August 2011 had indeed listed Turkish as an authentic language of the BIT.\n\n***The 20 January 2012 Hearing***\n---------------------------------\n\n1.2.47.\n\nThe BIT Issues hearing was held, as scheduled, in London on 20 January 2012, at the IDRC, 70 Fleet Street, London, EC4Y 1EU, United Kingdom (referred to indistinctively as **\"January 2012 hearing\"** or **\"BIT Issues hearing\").** The January 2012 hearing was recorded and transcribed.\n\n1.2.48.\n\nAt the January 2012 hearing, the Tribunal heard oral testimony from the following expert presented by Claimant:\n\n(a) Professor Yusuf \u00c7aliskan\n\n1.2.49.\n\nThe Tribunal also heard oral testimony from the following experts presented by Respondent:\n\n(a) Dr Emre \u00d4ktem\n\n(b) Dr Mehmet Karli\n\n(c) Dr Jaklin Komfilt\n\n1.2.50.\n\nIn the light of the parties\u2019 prior agreement and the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the available time at the January 2012 hearing was divided roughly equally.\n\n1.2.51.\n\nFollowing the January 2012 hearing, the members of the Tribunal deliberated by various means of communications including a meeting in London, United Kingdom, on 20 January 2012 and by a telephone-conference thereafter. In reaching its conclusions in the Decision that was to follow, the Tribunal took into account all pleadings, documents, testimony, expert opinions and oral submissions filed or made to that point in the case.\n\n1.2.52.\n\nIn its 7 May 2012 Decision, for reasons set out therein, the Tribunal determined that:\n\n(a) there are two authentic versions of the BIT, being the English and Russian versions, both signed in Ashkabat, Turkmenistan, on 2 May 1992;\n\n(b) the translation into English of the Russian version of the BIT that is found in Exhibit R-l (revised) is to be treated as accurate;\n\n(c) the meaning and effect of Article VII.2 of the BIT is that a concerned investor is required to submit its dispute to the courts of the Contracting Party with which a dispute has arisen, and must not have received a final award within one year from the date of submission of its case to the local courts, before it can institute arbitration proceedings in one of the fora in the manner permitted by Article VII.2; and\n\n(d) a decision on costs was deferred to a later stage of the arbitration.\n\n1.2.53.\n\nThe Tribunal also noted the apparent agreement of the parties that a decision should be made on jurisdiction, insofar as it relates to the meaning and effect of Article VII.2, as soon as reasonably possible in the event the Tribunal was to determine that prior recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan was mandatory under Article VII.2.\n\n1.2.54.\n\nHowever, because the parties had not yet provided submissions on the effect of non-compliance with the provisions of Article VII.2 of the BIT, assuming it to require mandatory recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan in the present case, the Tribunal invited the parties to make submissions, within 10 days of the receipt of the 7 May 2012 Decision, as to whether they wished to have an opportunity to make written/oral submissions with respect to the consequences to be drawn from Claimant\u2019s non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of Article VII.2. In the event that the parties wished to do so, the Tribunal indicated that it would fix a timetable for further submissions on that point.\n\n1.2.55.\n\nOn 17 May 2012, each of the parties made proposals in response to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation (set out in paragraph 9.29 of its 7 May 2012 Decision) to comment on the opportunity to make written/oral submissions regarding the consequences to be drawn from Claimant\u2019s non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of Article VII.2.\n\n1.2.56.\n\nIn light of Claimant\u2019s confirmation that it wished to make a written submission on the effect of its decision not to submit its dispute to the courts of Turkmenistan, on 23 May 2012, the Tribunal invited the parties to confer to determine whether a jointly proposed approach and timetable for the determination of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in these circumstances could be agreed.\n\n1.2.57.\n\nOn 1 June 2012, the parties responded to the Tribunal\u2019s request of 23 May 2012. Claimant stated that \"there remain a range of *prima facie* bases for the jurisdiction of the Centre that have been before the Tribunal and the Respondent for a considerable period of time. These apply notwithstanding the Tribunal\u2019s decision on Article VII.2 of the BIT\" and that the Tribunal should \"... reconsider its last communication to the Parties and prepare a procedural order consistent with the ICSID Convention and arbitral rules, the procedural rights of the Claimant and its own obligations.\" Respondent indicated that, should Claimant wish to make further submissions on the jurisdictional issue associated with its non-compliance with the provisions of Article VII.2, it would reply to any such submissions in accordance with an appropriate procedure to be agreed upon.\n\n1.2.58.\n\nOn 16 June 2012, the Tribunal took note of the views expressed by the parties on 1 June 2012. It also noted that, during the January 2012 hearing, both parties took the position that the jurisdictional effect of Claimant\u2019s admitted non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of Article VII.2 (which could be determinative of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this case) called for an appropriately speedy determination. The Tribunal therefore again invited the parties to consult with a view to proposing an agreed process and timetable for addressing the single jurisdictional question of the effect in this case of the requirement for prior recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan. The parties were requested to revert to the Tribunal by close of business, London time, on 29 June 2012.\n\n1.2.59.\n\nOn 29 June 2012, the parties wrote separately to the Tribunal. The parties did not share a common view. Respondent set out a proposal and timetable for submissions on the question. Claimant did not set out a proposal.\n\n1.2.60.\n\nOn 5 July 2012, having considered the parties\u2019 submissions of 17 May 2012, 1 June 2012 and 29 June 2012, the Tribunal proposed a first timetable which it considered would provide the parties with a full and fair opportunity to address the single jurisdictional question. In light of the parties\u2019 prior commitments, the following timetable was finally adopted by the Tribunal on 6 July 2012 and further confirmed and amended on 16 July 2012:\n\n(a) 6 August 2012: Respondent\u2019s Memorial;\n\n(b) 3 September 2012: Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial;\n\n(c) 1 October 2012: Respondent\u2019s Reply;\n\n(d) 29 October 2012: Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder; and\n\n(e) 7 December 2012: one day oral hearing in London, United Kingdom (with the afternoon and early evening of 6 December 2012 to be held against possible need).\n\n1.2.61.\n\nOn 18 July 2012, following further correspondence with the parties, and Respondent\u2019s agreement to file its Memorial one week earlier than the date contemplated in the Tribunal\u2019s timetable *(i.e.,* on 30 July 2012 instead of 6 August 2012), Claimant was given four weeks from 30 July 2012 to file its Counter-Memorial *(i.e.,* on 27 August 2012) and each party was given five weeks sequentially thereafter to file its second pleading *(i.e.,* Respondent\u2019s Reply on 1 October 2012 and Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on 5 November 2012).\n\n1.2.62.\n\nOn 30 July 2012, Respondent filed its Memorial on the Effects of Claimant\u2019s Non-Compliance with Article VII.2 of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT **(\"Respondent\u2019s Memorial\").**\n\n1.2.63.\n\nOn 27 August 2012, Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial With Respect to the Consequences to be Drawn from the Tribunal\u2019s Ruling of Article VII.2 of the BIT **(\"Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial\"),** together with a witness statement from Mr Osman Arslan, dated 27 August 2012.\n\n1.2.64.\n\nOn 1 October 2012, Respondent filed its Reply Memorial on the Effects of Claimant\u2019s Non-Compliance with the Mandatory Provisions of Article VII.2 of the BIT **(\"Respondent\u2019s Reply Memorial\").**\n\n1.2.65.\n\nOn 5 November 2012, Claimant filed its Rejoinder with Respect to the Consequences to be Drawn from the Tribunal\u2019s Ruling on Article VII.2 **(\"Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder\"),** together with a second witness statement from Mr Osman Arslan, dated 1 November 2012.\n\n1.2.66.\n\nOn 13 November 2012, the Tribunal wrote to the parties suggesting a timetable for the 7 December 2012 oral hearing **(\"December 2012 hearing\")** and requesting the parties\u2019 comments on the Tribunal\u2019s proposed approach to the day, to be received not later than Monday, 19 November 2012.\n\n1.2.67.\n\nOn 20 November 2012, neither of the parties having suggested a different approach or timetable for the December 2012 hearing, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would commence at 9:00 a.m., on 7 December 2012, at the IDRC, 70 Fleet Street, London, United Kingdom, as well as the proposed timetable for the hearing.\n\n***The December 2012 Hearing***\n-------------------------------\n\n1.2.68.\n\nThe December 2012 hearing, dealing with the single question of the jurisdictional effect of the requirement for prior recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan, was held, as scheduled, in London at the IDRC, 70 Fleet Street, London, EC4Y 1EU, United Kingdom. No oral testimony was taken and the hearing was limited to oral submissions from the parties and responses from the parties to the Tribunal\u2019s questions.\n\n1.2.69.\n\nIn the light of the parties\u2019 prior agreement, and at the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the available time at the December 2012 hearing was divided roughly equally.\n\n1.2.70.\n\nAt the close of the hearing, the Tribunal offered the parties the opportunity to file a 10-page submission on \"the ability of this Tribunal to suspend these proceedings in the event that it would determine that the MFN provision does not encompass dispute resolution, and in the event it would determine that recourse to the Turkmenistan courts would not be futile.\"2\n\nTranscript of 7 December 2012 hearing, p. 192/13-17.\n\n1.2.71.\n\nOn 21 December 2012, each of the parties filed short post-hearing briefs.\n\n1.2.72.\n\nOn 8 January 2013, each of the parties filed its claim for costs.\n\n1.2.73.\n\nOn 18 January 2013, each of the parties commented on the other\u2019s claim for costs.\n\n1.2.74.\n\nFollowing the December 2012 hearing, the members of the Tribunal deliberated by various means of communications, including a meeting in London, United Kingdom on 7 December 2012 and by telephone-conference thereafter. In reaching its conclusions in this Award, the Tribunal has taken into account the 7 May 2012 Decision, all pleadings, documents, testimony and oral submissions filed or made respecting or which relate to the single jurisdictional question.\n\n1.2.75.\n\nThe 7 May 2012 Decision is incorporated in this Award as Annex A, and constitutes an integral part thereof.\n\n1.2.76.\n\nThroughout the course of these proceedings, the Tribunal has been greatly assisted by the submissions of counsel, who, in turn, were helped by many others whose names do not appear in the transcriptions of the hearings. It is, therefore, appropriate at the beginning of this Award to record our appreciation of the excellent efforts which counsel for the disputing parties have brought to bear during these proceedings, together with their respective assistants and other advisers.\n\n**2. FACTS**\n------------\n\n**2.1 The Tribunal\u2019s Approach to the Facts**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n2.1.1.\n\nA review of disputing parties\u2019 submissions, witness statements and documentary exhibits indicates, for present purposes, that, with few exceptions, the facts out of which this dispute arises are either agreed, or not seriously disputed. Put another way, most of the differences between the parties relate to the parties\u2019 different approaches to the proper construction of the BIT and the state of Respondent\u2019s court system.\n\n2.1.2.\n\nWe set out below a summary of the facts most relevant to the single jurisdictional question dealt with in this Award - either as agreed, not disputed or determined by the Tribunal.\n\n**2.2 Background**\n------------------\n\n2.2.1.\n\nThe BIT was signed on 2 May 1992 in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, and entered into force on 13 March 1997.\n\n2.2.2.\n\nKili\u00e7 is a Turkish construction company which has been operating since 1979 in Turkey. It has operated in Turkmenistan since approximately November 1994.\n\n2.2.3.\n\nRespondent has indicated that Claimant\u2019s standing as an \"investor\" will be put in issue as a matter of jurisdiction, if required, at a later stage of these proceedings. For the purpose of this Award, however, such standing is assumed.\n\n2.2.4.\n\nFrom 1994 onwards, Kili\u00e7 entered into a number of building contracts in connection with projects in the Turkmen cities of Mary, Dashoguz and Ashgabat. Without seeking to be all inclusive, the parties to the relevant contracts were, Kili\u00e7 (or one of its affiliated companies) and various municipal governors, and other state officials.\n\n2.2.5.\n\nDuring the course of construction of the various projects, issues arose between the contracting parties as to their respective performance under the relevant contracts.\n\n2.2.6.\n\nDuring the course of 2009, Claimant wrote a number of letters to municipal and state officials in relation to the Dashoguz and Ashgabat, Turkmenistan based projects, seeking to resolve certain issues which had arisen in relation to those projects.3\n\nThis correspondence is described by Claimant as \"Amicable Settlement Letters,\" *see'.* Request, Annex E.\n\n2.2.7.\n\nClaimant said that its concerns in relation to the various contractual issues that had arisen were not resolved as a result of its various letters and, on 30 December 2009, it filed its Request with ICSID.\n\n2.2.8.\n\nWithout considering whether Claimant\u2019s Amicable Settlement Letters constituted notification in writing of disputes as required under Article VII. 1, it is common ground that Respondent did not submit, or seek to submit its concems/disputes to the courts of Turkmenistan prior to filing its Request.\n\n2.2.9.\n\nClaimant did not file testamentary evidence seeking to explain why it chose not to submit its disputes to the courts of Turkmenistan.\n\n**3. RESPONDENT\u2019S CASE**\n------------------------\n\n**3.1 Summary**\n---------------\n\n3.1.1.\n\nRespondent contends that under VII.2 of the BIT, an investor\u2019s right to submit a dispute to international arbitration is subject to the condition that the dispute must first be submitted to the national courts of the host state, and that a decision has not been rendered within one year. This is said to be an essential element of Turkmenistan\u2019s consent to international arbitration under the Treaty. As such, this constitutes a jurisdictional requirement. Respondent notes that it is uncontested, that Claimant did not bring the present dispute before the national courts of Turkmenistan. Claimant\u2019s failure to comply with the mandatory provisions of Article VII.2 of the BIT thus deprives both ICSID and the Tribunal of jurisdiction. Respondent maintains that the Treaty\u2019s most-favoured nation provisions **(\"MFN\")** do not apply to its dispute resolution provisions. Thus, Claimant cannot use the dispute resolution provisions from other qualifying BITs to displace the requirement for prior recourse.\n\n**3.2 Failure to Comply with Article VII.2 Conditions Deprives the Tribunal of Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.2.1.\n\nRespondent points out that it is a general principle of international law that international courts and tribunals may exercise jurisdiction over a state only with its consent - indeed, international arbitration is always premised on the parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate. For ICSID to have jurisdiction over an investor\u2019s claim, there must be an agreement to arbitrate between the host state and the foreign investor.\n\n3.2.2.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention provides, in pertinent part that:\n\n*\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"*\n\n3.2.3.\n\nArticle 26 of the ICSID Convention provides that Contracting States may expressly require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under the Convention. In line with Article 26, Turkey and Turkmenistan expressly conditioned their consent to arbitration by providing for a mandatory mechanism requiring: first, a six-month period of settlement negotiations; then the submission of the dispute to national courts; and only thereafter, submission to an international tribunal if the national courts have not rendered a decision within one year. This is said to indicate that the Contracting Parties to the BIT did not intend for automatic, direct recourse to international arbitration.\n\n3.2.4.\n\nFor an arbitration agreement to exist, Respondent asserts that the investor must accept the host state\u2019s standing offer under the same terms and conditions. As stated by Christoph Schreuer:\n\n*\"[i]f the terms of acceptance do not correspond with the terms of the offer there is no perfected consent.\"4*\n\nChristoph Schreuer, *Consent to Arbitration,* UNCTAD Course on Dispute Settlement, International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, Module 2.3, Exhibit **(\"Exh.\")** RL-14, p. 30.\n\n3.2.5.\n\nRespondent notes that Professor Schreuer\u2019s analysis has been adopted by the *Winter shall* and *ICS* tribunals.5\n\n*Wintershall v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award (8 December 2008) (\"***Wintershall\"),***  Exh. RL-5, \u00b6\u00b6 116, 127 & 160.2 and, *ICS Inspection and Control Services Limited (United Kingdom) and The Argentine Republic,* PCA Case No. 2010-9, Award on Jurisdiction (10 February 2012) (\"/CS\"), Exh. RL-18, \u00b6\u00b6 270 & 272.\n\n3.2.6.\n\nIn *Wintershall,* the tribunal considered Argentina\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration was \"conditioned upon\" a claimant first submitting the dispute to the courts of Argentina.\n\n*\"The eighteen-month requirement of a proceeding before local courts (stipulated in Article 10(2)) is*  *an essential preliminary step to the institution of ICSID Arbitration, under the Argentina-Germany BIT;* *it constitutes*  *an integral part of the \"standing offer\" (\"consent\") of the Host State, which must be accepted on the same terms by every individual investor who seeks recourse (ultimately) to ICSID arbitration for resolving its dispute with the Host State under the concerned BIT* *.\"6 (Respondent\u2019s emphasis)*\n\n*Wintershall,* Exh. RL-5, \u00b6 160.(2).\n\n3.2.7.\n\nThe *Winter shall* tribunal further stated:\n\n*\"a local-remedies rule may be lawfully provided for in the BIT under the first part of Article 26;*  *once so provided, as in Article 10(2), it becomes a condition of Argentina\u2019s \"consent\" - which is, in effect, Argentina\u2019s \"offer \" to arbitrate disputes under the BIT,* *but only upon acceptance and compliance by an investor of the provisions inter alia of Article 10(* *2); an investor (like the Claimant) can accept the \"offer\" only as so conditioned* *.\"7 (Respondent\u2019s emphasis)*\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 116.\n\n3.2.8.\n\nThe *ICS* tribunal, in discussing the effects of the claimant\u2019s non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of the UK-Argentina BIT requiring that the dispute be first submitted to the Courts of Argentina for a period of 18 months prior to commencing arbitration, noted that \" [t]he formation of the agreement to arbitrate occurs through the acceptance by the investor of the standing offer to arbitrate found in the relevant investment treaty\"8 and that \"[a]t the time of commencing dispute resolution under the treaty, the investor can only accept or decline the offer to arbitrate, but cannot vary its terms.\"9\n\nICS',Exh. RL-18, \u00b6 270.\n\nId.,\u00b6272.\n\n3.2.9.\n\nHaving determined that the requirement to submit the dispute to the national courts of Argentina was mandatory, the *ICS* tribunal dealt with the distinction between admissibility and jurisdiction in the following terms:\n\n*\"The above determination that the prior submission of the investment dispute to the Argentine courts is mandatory still leaves the Tribunal faced with the question of what effect is to be given to non-compliance with this requirement. That question, in turn, depends on whether compliance with Article 8(1) is properly considered to be a question of jurisdiction, admissibility, or procedure. In particular, it is the line between jurisdiction and admissibility that is important.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*[...] [t]he failure to respect the pre-condition to the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitrate cannot but lead to the conclusion that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute.* *Not only has the Respondent specifically conditioned its consent to arbitration on a requirement not yet fulfilled, but the Contracting Parties to the Treaty have expressly required the prior submission of a dispute to the Argentine courts for at least 18 months, before a recourse to international arbitration is initiated.*  *The Tribunal is simply not empowered to disregard these limits on its jurisdiction.\"* *10 (Respondent\u2019s emphasis)*\n\n*ICS,* Exh. RL-18, \u00b6\u00b6 252, 262 (internal citations omitted).\n\n3.2.10.\n\nIn the present case, Respondent argues that its offer to arbitrate was expressly conditioned on a qualifying investor\u2019s prior compliance with the mandatory provisions of Article VII.2. By choosing to forgo prior recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan, Claimant undoubtedly went beyond the limits of Turkmenistan\u2019s offer to arbitrate, as a result of which, there is no perfected consent to ICSID arbitration, no agreement to arbitrate and, therefore, no ICSID jurisdiction to hear the merits of this case.\n\n3.2.11.\n\nIn addition to *Wintershall* and *ICS,* Respondent relies on the decisions in *DRC v. Rwanda, Murphy Exploration v. Ecuador, Burlington Resources v. Ecuador* and *Enron v. Argentina* in support of its basic proposition.11\n\n*See Wintershall,* Exh. RL-5, \u00b6\u00b6 160; *ICS,* Exh.

RL-8, \u00b6 88.\n\n3.2.12.\n\nIn the *Enron* case, Respondent points out that even though Enron had complied with the mandatory waiting period provided for in the US-Argentina BIT, the *Enron* tribunal nevertheless noted that:\n\n*\"[s]uch requirement is in the view of the Tribunal very much a jurisdictional one.*  *A failure to comply with that requirement would result in a determination of lack of jurisdiction.**\"12 (Respondent\u2019s emphasis)*\n\n*Enron,* Exh. RL-8, \u00b6 88.\n\n3.2.13.\n\nRespondent notes finally that the BIT\u2019s requirement for prior recourse to the national courts of the host state as a pre-condition to resorting to international arbitration is an expression of the host state\u2019s sovereignty. Here, Turkey and Turkmenistan unequivocally agreed to give local courts the opportunity, within one year of resolving the dispute. This type of provision, which finds justification in strong policy considerations, is both classic and reasonable.\n\n**3.3 Article VII.2\u2019s Mandatory Requirements are not Over-Ridden by Article II.2\u2019s MFN Provisions**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.3.1.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant\u2019s attempt to create Turkmenistan\u2019s consent to submit this dispute to ICSID by operation of the MFN clause included in Article II.2 of the BIT cannot succeed.\n\n3.3.2.\n\nRespondent first maintains that for an investor to assert a claim for denial of MFN treatment, it must accept the state\u2019s standing offer of international arbitration in accordance with the conditions of the basic treaty. Thus, as an investor wishing to raise an MFN claim under the BIT lacks standing to do so until it has fulfilled the domestic courts proviso of Article VII.2.\n\n3.3.3.\n\nRespondent relies on Zachary Douglas\u2019 2010 article, *\"The MFN Clause in Investment Arbitration: Treaty Interpretations off the Rails'\"* in which Douglas makes the case for a negative answer to the question of whether an MFN clause in a basic treaty **(\"Basic Treaty\")** can be relied upon by an investor to expand the jurisdiction of an international tribunal established in accordance with the jurisdiction provisions in the basic treaty by incorporating the more favourable \"treatment\" reflected in the jurisdictional provisions in a third treaty **(\"Comparator Treaty\").**\n\n3.3.4.\n\nDouglas considers that for an investor to assert a claim for MFN treatment, it must first accept the state\u2019s standing offer to arbitrate in accordance with the terms of the Basic Treaty. Douglas points out that for a claimant to assert a right to more favourable treatment by claiming through the MFN clause in the Basic Treaty:\n\n*\"It can only do so by instituting arbitration proceedings and thus by accepting the terms of the standing offer of arbitration in the basic treaty. At that point an arbitration agreement between the claimant and the host state comes into existence. And the existence of that arbitration agreement is critical to the viability of the arbitration regime envisaged by the investment treaty.\"13*\n\nZachary Douglas, *The MFN Clause in Investment Arbitration: Treaty Interpretation Off the Rails, 2 JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT 97 (2011),* Exh. RL-25, *p. 107* (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n3.3.5.\n\nIn the recent *Daimler* award, the tribunal raised the question of \"when, chronologically speaking, does an aggrieved investor acquire standing to raise an MFN claim before an investor-State arbitral tribunal under [the Basic Treaty\u2019s arbitral clause]?\"14\n\n*Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award (22 August 2012) ***(\"Daimler\"),*** Exh. RL-28, \u00b6 199\n\n3.3.6.\n\nThe *Daimler* tribunal\u2019s answer to its own question was that, for an MFN clause to operate, the claimant had first to satisfy the necessary condition precedent for Argentina\u2019s consent to international arbitration to exist. In pertinent part, it concluded:\n\n\" *To put it more concretely, since the Claimant has not yet satisfied the necessary condition precedent to Argentina\u2019s consent to international arbitration, its MFN arguments are not yet properly before the Tribunal* *.* *The Tribunal is therefore presently without jurisdiction to rule on any MFN-based claims*  *unless* *the MFN clauses themselves supply the tribunal with the necessary jurisdiction, (emphasis in original)*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*Argentina\u2019s consent to international arbitration is contained within the same instrument as the MFN guarantees giving rise to some of the Claimant\u2019s jurisdictional arguments. But the physical location (external instrument versus within the same treaty) of a State\u2019s consent to a particular type of dispute resolution does not eviscerate the requirement, stressed by the ICJ, that the State must have consented to* *the particular type of dispute settlement in question*  *before* *the claimant may raise any MFN claims before the designated forum.*  *According to this logic, the Claimant may not yet have standing to raise any MFN arguments at all before the Tribunal* *.\"15 (Respondent\u2019s emphasis of last sentence)*\n\nThe tribunal concluded:\n\n*\"[t]he Claimant does not yet have standing to assert its claims under the German-Argentine BIT, because it has not yet satisfied the Treaty\u2019s Article 10 conditions precedent to invoke international arbitration. As such, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction at present to entertain the Claimant\u2019s MFN or any other claim.\"16*\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 200-204.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b628l.\n\n3.3.7.\n\nRespondent concludes, on this point, that Claimant\u2019s deliberate choice not to comply with the Article VII.2 precondition to Turkmenistan\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration results in there being no perfected consent to ICSID arbitration, and therefore no jurisdiction of the Tribunal to entertain any of the Claimant\u2019s claims, including its MFN claim.\n\n***The BIT\u2019s MFN Clause Does Not Cover Dispute Resolution Provisions***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.3.8.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal were to find that it has jurisdiction to consider Claimant\u2019s MFN-based right of immediate access to ICSID arbitration, Respondent contends that the Article II.2 MFN clause cannot operate to displace mandatory prerequisites to Turkmenistan\u2019s consent in the absence of the BIT parties having explicitly so agreed.\n\n3.3.9.\n\nRespondent refers to the two distinct approaches in the different decisions rendered on the application of MFN clauses to dispute resolution provisions **(\"DRPs\") -** the first beginning with *Maffezini* (which proceeds on the basis that DRPs fall within the scope of an MFN clause in a BIT, unless the contrary is plainly demonstrated);17 the second, beginning with *Salini,*18 followed by *Plama*19 and others, (to... the effect that \"Contracting States cannot be presumed to have agreed that these provisions could be displaced by incorporating DRPs from other treaties negotiated by the host state with a different party and in an entirely different context\").20\n\n*Emilio Agustin Maffezini v.

RL-9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial, \u00b6 20 (citing *Plama* \u00b6 207).\n\n3.3.10.\n\nIn *Plama,* the tribunal rejected the claimant\u2019s attempt to broaden the scope of jurisdiction of the Basic Treaty by operation of the MFN clause contained in Bulgaria\u2019s BIT with Finland, holding that:\n\n*\"[A]n MFN provision in a basic treaty does not incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty, unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them.\"21*\n\n*Plama* Exh. RL-9, \u00b6 223. As highlighted by Respondent, \"the tribunal in *Plama* noted that as a \u2018reaction\u2019 to the \u2018expansive interpretation made in the *Maffezini* case,\u2019 a number of States subsequently negotiated specific exclusionary language in their treaties so as to avoid similar interpretations.\" Respondent\u2019s Reply Memorial, FN 42 (citing to *Plama* \u00b6 203).\n\n3.3.11.\n\nThe *Plama* tribunal expressly criticised and refused to follow *Maffezini* on the point. It went on to state:\n\n*\"[D]ispute resolution provisions in a specific treaty have been negotiated with a view to resolving disputes under that treaty. Contracting States cannot be presumed to have agreed that those provisions can be enlarged by incorporating dispute resolution* *provisions from other treaties negotiated in an entirely different context.22*\n\n*Plama,* Exh. RL-9, \u00b6 207.\n\n3.3.12.\n\nRespondent argues that the *Maffezini* line of decisions, relied upon by Claimant, has been strongly criticised. In any event, the *Maffezini* holding is said not to support Claimant\u2019s case.\n\n3.3.13.\n\nRespondent points out that the *Maffezini* tribunal based its reasoning on the broad MFN clause that was contained in the BIT at issue in that case, which expressly applied to \"all matters subject to this Agreement.\"23 The MFN clause in the present case does not cover \"all matters subject to\" the BIT.\n\n*Maffezini,* Exh. CL-18, \u00b6 53.\n\n3.3.14.\n\nRespondent draws attention to the *Maffezini* tribunal\u2019s expression of caution against over-extending MFN clauses, which \"should not be able to override public policy considerations that the contracting parties might have envisaged as fundamental conditions for their acceptance of the agreement in question,\" including conditions requiring \"exhaustion of local remedies,\" which it recognised could lead to \"disruptive treaty-shopping that would play havoc with the policy objectives of underlying specific treaty provisions..,\"24\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.\n\n3.3.15.\n\nArguing that the *Maffezini* line of decisions have been strongly criticised by both scholars and tribunals, Respondent points to Douglas\u2019 observation that: \"[t]he *Maffezini* decision represents a point of departure from the existing conception of the function of MFN clauses in international law,\"25 and that investment treaty tribunals which have followed this approach \"have attempted to convert the fiction of automatic incorporation into a reality by pretending that the terms of their own jurisdiction in the basic treaty are rewritten before the commencement of proceedings by reference to the provisions of a third treaty. The claimant/investor is not making a claim for MFN treatment but is rather being permitted to enforce this fiction. This is contrary to general principle and authority..,\"26\n\nDouglas, *The MFN Clause in Investment Arbitration,* n. 13, Exh. RL-25, p. 102.\n\n*Id.,* p. 108.\n\n3.3.16.\n\nCommenting on the *Siemens* decision, on which Claimant relies heavily in its Counter-Memorial, Respondent notes that the tribunal there adopted the *Maffezini* approach without even analysing the nature of the dispute settlement clause in the Basic Treaty. Indeed, the *Siemens* tribunal went so far as to state that \"the purpose of the MFN clause is to eliminate the effect of specially negotiated provisions unless they have been excepted.\"27 (Respondent\u2019s emphasis)\n\n*Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/08, Decision on Jurisdiction (3 August 2004) ***(\"Siemens\").*** Exh. CL-15, \u00b6 106.\n\n3.3.17.\n\nRespondent also points out that Professor Bello Janeiro, co-arbitrator appointed by Argentina in the *Siemens* case, subsequently sat as co-arbitrator in the *Daimler* case which reached the opposite conclusion. In that case, Professor Janeiro submitted a concurring opinion in which he subscribed fully to the conclusion that an MFN clause could not over-ride the mandatory requirement of first submitting the dispute to the local courts of the host state. He also explained his change of view on the question since the *Siemens* decision.\n\n3.3.18.\n\nIn summary, Respondent submits that it cannot be presumed that DRPs and, *a fortiori,* mandatory prerequisites to the state\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration fall within the scope of an MFN clause included in a BIT, unless the contrary is plainly demonstrated. Finding otherwise, it is said, would negate the basic international law principle that a State\u2019s consent to arbitrate must be clear and unequivocal. Here there is no clear and unequivocal intention to apply MFN clause to dispute resolution matters.\n\n3.3.19.\n\nRespondent contends that Article II does not encompass the DRPs which are found in Article VII.2. Article II provides, in pertinent part:\n\n*\"1. Each Party shall permit in its territory investments, and activities associated therewith, on a basis no less favourable than that accorded in similar situations to investments of investors of any third country, within the framework of its laws and regulations.*\n\n*2. Each party shall accord to these investments, once established, treatment no loss favourable than that accorded in similar situations to investments of its investors or to investments of investors of any third country, whichever is the most favourable.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*4. The provisions of this Article shall have no effect in relation to the following agreements entered into by either of the Parties.*\n\n*(a) relating to any existing or future customs unions, regional economic organization or similar international agreements.*\n\n*(b) relating wholly or mainly to taxation.\"28*\n\nBIT, Article II, Exhs. C-l, R-2.\n\n3.3.20.\n\nRespondent observes that the Tribunal, in interpreting the BIT and specifically Article II, must apply the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties **(\"VCLT\"),** according to which the starting point is the text of the treaty itself.\n\n3.3.21.\n\nAs set forth in Article 31.1 of the VCLT, \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n3.3.22.\n\nRespondent points out that the text of Article II does not, directly or by reference, refer to dispute resolution matters. In light of the *Plama* line of decisions, and consistent with the principle that the requirement that the state consent be clear and unequivocal, the absence of any explicit reference to DRPs in the text of Article II.2 excludes that the DRPs found in Article VII.2 fall within the scope of the MFN clause.\n\n3.3.23.\n\nRespondent points out that each of the tribunals in *Plama, Wintershall, Salini* and *Telenor29* observed that the language of the MFN clause in *Maffezini* was broad referring to \"all matters subject to this Agreement\" which was not true of the MFN clause in their cases.\n\n*Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15, Award (13 September 2006), Exh. RL-32.\n\n3.3.24.\n\nLikewise, in the *Suez-InterAguasv30* and *Gas Natural31* cases on which Claimant is relying, the MFN clause in question also referred to \"all matters governed\" by the relevant BIT. In the latter case, the clause reads: \"[i]n all matters governed by the present BIT\". In *Suez-AWG,* the clause of the Argentine-Spain BIT also contains the words \"in all matters governed by this Agreement.\"32 Similarly, in *Impregilo,* the majority relied on a broad MFN clause that extended its scope to \"all other matters regulated by this Agreement\" to justify importation of dispute settlement provisions from another BIT.33 The *Impregilo* tribunal also noted the cases that had interpreted such broad MFN language similarly.34\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales de Agua S.A. v. the Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Jurisdiction (16 May 2006) ***(\"Suez-InterAguas\"),*** Exh.

Accordingly, even under the *Maffezini* approach, the MFN clause here would still not support importation of dispute resolution clauses from other BITs.\n\n3.3.26.\n\nRespondent also asserts that the word \"treatment\" does not encompass dispute resolution matters. It points out that the Treaty does not define the term \"treatment\", and says that Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article II.2 rests on the mere assertion that it refers broadly to \"treatment\" and that \"... dispute resolution before a neutral forum, such as the present Tribunal, clearly falls within that \u2018treatment\u2019.\"35\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial, \u00b6 9; Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 8.\n\n***Principle of Contemporaneity***\n----------------------------------\n\n3.3.27.\n\nRespondent contends that, to appreciate whether Turkey and Turkmenistan intended the term \"treatment\" to cover the BIT\u2019s DRPs, including the Article VII.2 precondition to the Contracting Parties\u2019 consent to ICSID, the Tribunal must apply the classical rule of interpretation known as the Principle of Contemporaneity, which requires that the meaning and scope of a term be ascertained at the time when the Contracting Parties negotiated the Treaty.\n\n3.3.28.\n\nAt that time, in the early 1990\u2019s, Respondent says that scholars and arbitral tribunals, inspired by international commercial arbitration, insisted on the autonomy of the arbitration clause. As noted by the *Daimler* tribunal, \"[t]reaty-based questions concerning the relation of MFN clauses to international investor-state dispute resolution mechanisms had not yet arisen and remained entirely unexplored.\"36\n\n*Daimler,* Exh. RL-28, \u00b6 221.\n\n3.3.29.\n\nRespondent also refers to the 1992 World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment, particularly Part III, devoted to \"treatment\", in which the prevailing view within the Development Committee of the World Bank, was that \"treatment\" was meant to cover principles of conduct applicable to the state hosting the foreign investment, with a view to safeguarding the investment from any discriminatory or unfair and inequitable practices within the host state\u2019s territory.\n\n3.3.30.\n\nRespondent argues that the discussion of the word \"treatment\" in Part III covers fair and equitable treatment, treatment as favourable as that afforded to national investors in similar circumstances, full protection and security, non-discriminatory treatment, the prompt issuance of necessary licenses and permits, authorisations for the employment of key personnel, the free transfer of revenues earned by or related to the investment, the reinvestment of the proceeds of the investment within the territory of the host states, and finally, the prevention and control of corrupt business practices and the promotion of accountability and transparency in dealing with foreign investors.\n\n3.3.31.\n\nNothing in the World Bank Guidelines discussion of \"treatment\" alludes to the international - as opposed to domestic - settlement of disputes. To the extent that the Guidelines refer to international settlement of investor-state disputes, they do so only once and in an entirely separate and final section, which suggest that \"treatment\" and international dispute settlement were viewed at the time as separate issues.\n\n3.3.32.\n\nRespondent refers to the fact that in both the *ICS* and *Daimler* cases the tribunals relied on the World Bank Guidelines to elaborate the meaning of the word \"treatment\" included in the MFN provisions of the Argentine-Germany BIT and found that, at the time of the conclusion of the BIT - which is contemporaneous with negotiation of the BIT - the term \"treatment\" was likely to refer to the host state\u2019s direct treatment of the investment, and not to the conduct of any international arbitration arising out of that investment.\n\n3.3.33.\n\nFurther, Respondent says that, Claimant having not adduced any evidence to suggest that either Turkey or Turkmenistan maintained a different definition of treatment in the early 1990\u2019s, the only evidence presently on the record regarding the interpretation of the word \"treatment\" leads to the conclusion that it was meant by both Contracting Parties at the time of the conclusion of the BIT to refer to the host state\u2019s direct treatment of investment and not to the conduct of any international arbitration arising out of treatment.\n\n***The Exceptions to the MFN Clause do not Support Claimant\u2019s Position***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.3.34.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimant\u2019s argument, based on the maxim *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* is without merit. This is because the exceptions found in Article II.4, which exclude from the scope of Article II, treatment in connection with \"any existing or future customs unions, regional economic organization or similar international agreements,\"37 as well as international agreements \"relating wholly or mainly to taxation,\"38 deal exclusively with the Contracting Parties\u2019 direct treatment of foreign investment.\n\nBIT, Article II.4 (a), Exhs. C-l; R-2.\n\n*Id.,* Article II.4 (b).\n\n***Ejusdem Generis Principle Applies***\n---------------------------------------\n\n3.3.35.\n\nRespondent argues that the *ejusdem generis* principle limits the scope of the MFN clause to the subject matter to which such MFN clause refers. Thus, the nature of the exceptions corroborates the conclusion that the word \"treatment\" refers to the substantive rights accorded to foreign investors.\n\n3.3.36.\n\nIt is true that the exceptions do not suggest any exclusion of dispute resolution matters. However, it is equally true that the Contracting Parties may not be taken to have excluded DRPs, because they never imagined that DRPs could be covered by the MFN provision in the first place.\n\n3.3.37.\n\nFor example, with regard to the exceptions to the MFN clause included in the Germany-Argentina BIT, the *Daimler* tribunal said:\n\n*\"The present Tribunal does not, however, view the presence of these exceptions as an indication that the State Parties intended to include the Treaty\u2019s international investor-State dispute resolution provisions within the scope of its MFN commitments.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*[I]t cannot be denied that all of the typical exceptions to MFN treatment observed in international investment treaties (at least in treaties concluded prior to the advent of the Maffezini decision) deal exclusively with the contracting States\u2019 direct treatment of foreign investments, never with the international resolution of investor State disputes arising out of that treatment. Overlooking the obvious differences between rights and remedies would seem to push the principle expressio unius est exclusio alterius too far. One cannot use the principle to prove the nonexistence of apples based upon the existence of oranges. [...] Indeed, it*  *seems more likely that the Contracting State Parties, acting as they were prior to Maffezini, did not explicitly exclude international investor-State dispute resolution provisions from the scope of the MFN clauses simply because they never considered such an invocation of the clause to be possible**.\"39(Respondent\u2019s emphasis)*\n\n*Daimler,* Exh. RL-28, \u00b6\u00b6 238-239 (internal citation omitted).\n\n3.3.38.\n\nIn sum, Respondent argues that it is generally accepted that the *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* argument is not conclusive as to the scope of an MFN clause. As stated by the *ICS* tribunal, such an argument \"may apply with equal force in either direction and only serves to confirm a prior conclusion about the effect of the MFN.\"40 In this case, rather than supporting Claimant\u2019s unsubstantiated assertion that \"dispute resolution before a neutral forum, such as the present Tribunal, clearly falls within [the] \u2018treatment\u2019\"41 of the BIT\u2019s MFN clause, Respondent submits that the nature of these exceptions further confirms its position that, at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty, the term \"treatment\" was meant to refer to the host state\u2019s direct treatment of investment, to the exclusion of international dispute settlement arising out of such \"treatment\".\n\nICS Exh. RL-18, \u00b6 313.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 8.\n\n***Principle of Effectiveness Invalidates Claimant\u2019s Interpretation of MFN Clause***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.3.39.\n\nRespondent says that it is an established principle of international law, that treaties must be interpreted in the light of the principle of effectiveness of all their provisions.42 However, Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article II.2 would make Article VII.2 *ah initio no effet utile.*\n\n*VCLT,* Exh. RL-1, Article 31.\n\n3.3.40.\n\nThis is said to be illustrated by the fact that, when the BIT was entered into on 2 May 1992, Turkey had entered into 22 BITs with other countries, a number of which did not contain any requirement for the prior submission to the local courts of the host state.\n\n3.3.41.\n\nIn these circumstances, if Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article II.2 were to be accepted, Article VII.2 of the BIT would have been ineffectual, *ab initio,* as any Turkmen investor could have disregarded its prior recourse requirements at will from the moment the Treaty entered into force.\n\n3.3.42.\n\nMore importantly, \"the prior recourse requirement of Article VII.2 of the Treaty would not have been reciprocal *ab initio* since Turkish investors in Turkmenistan would be bound to first submit their dispute to the Turkmen local courts [before initiating arbitration], while Turkmen investors in Turkey would not be required to submit their dispute to the Turkish courts.\"43\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Memorial, \u00b6 51.\n\n3.3.43.\n\nBecause it would make no sense for state parties to international treaties consciously to enter into non-reciprocal obligations, this confirms that, at the time of the signature of the BIT, Turkey and Turkmenistan did not - and could not - imagine that the Article VII.2\u2019s mandatory requirement for prior submission of any dispute to the local courts of the host state could be over-ridden by operation of the MFN clause.\n\n***DRPs of Switzerland \u2014 Turkmenistan BIT are not \"More Favourable\" Than Those of the BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.3.44.\n\nRespondent argues that Turkish and Swiss investors *(i.e.,* the investors covered by the Comparator Treaty relied on by Claimant) are not in \"similar situations\" within the meaning of Article II.2. And, as explained by the UNCTAD, \"the treatment afforded by a host State to foreign investors can only be appropriately compared if they are in objectively similar situations.\"44\n\nUNCTAD *Most-Favoured Nation Treatment,* p. 26, Exh. CL-1.\n\n3.3.45.\n\nArticle II.2 of the BIT expressly provides that the comparison must be made between the treatments respectively provided to foreign investors \"in similar situations\":\n\n*\"Each party shall accord to these investments, once they are established, treatment no less favourable than that accorded*  *in similar situations* *to investments of its investors or to investments of investors of any third country, whichever is the most favourable.\"45 (Respondent\u2019s emphasis)*\n\nBIT, Article II.2, Exhs. C-l; R-2.\n\n3.3.46.\n\nRespondent notes that on 1 May 2002, there were 596 registered Turkish individuals or entities operating in Turkmenistan, but that only about 15 Swiss investors were currently active there.46\n\n[A]s of 1 May 2002, 1708 foreign legal entities... including 596 Turkish legal entities... have been registered by the State in Turkmenistan.\" In other words, 35% of all foreign investors in Turkmenistan are Turkish. *See* Letter from Mr Byashimmurat Hojamammedov, Ministry of Economy and Development of Turkmenistan, to the Ministry of Justice of Turkmenistan, dated 2 May 2012, Exh. R-16. *See also,* Embassy of Switzerland in Baku (Azerbaijan), *Turkmenistan Annual Report 2011.* The latest annual report of the Embassy of Switzerland in Baku on Turkmenistan, published on the OSEC (Centre of Expertise for Swiss Foreign Trade) website, describes both bilateral trade relationships and direct investments as \"not very extensive,\" specifying that only \"around fifteen Swiss companies are present in Turkmenistan,\" \u00b6 3.2, Exh. R-17.\n\n3.3.47.\n\nFurther, Turkish investors in Turkmenistan are mainly operating in the construction field, individually or through small to medium-sized companies,47 whereas Swiss investors seek to operate in the oil and gas and investment sectors, through larger entities.48\n\nCompilation of Articles Regarding Turkish Investors in the Construction Sector, see, e.g., *Turk sirketleri, Turkmenistan\u2019 da 3 milyar doklarlik proje \u00fcstlendi (Turkish Companies Undertook Projects Worth 3 Billion Dollars in Turkmenistan), DUNYA NEWSPAPER (21 June 2012),* Exh. R-18.\n\nTurkmenistan and Switzerland have recently discussed \"the possibilities of inter-state cooperation on a number of key areas, including the fuel-energy sector, the economy and investment and tourism, where Switzerland has rich experience.\" *See:* Turkmen President to Discuss Cooperation Issues in Switzerland (16 July 2012), Exh. R-19.\n\n3.3.48.\n\nRespondent argues that while direct access to international arbitration may be seen by state parties to BITs as particularly adapted to high-stakes oil & gas or investment disputes, involving long-term contracts with a few major oil and banking companies, the same is not necessarily true for smaller construction disputes, involving smaller construction companies operating in much greater numbers. As such, Turkish and Swiss investors cannot be considered to be in \"similar situations\" within the meaning of Article II.2.\n\n3.3.49.\n\nRespondent further argues that Claimant did not run the objective comparison required for the application of Article II.2. According to the UNCTAD, \"a comparison and an objective test of less favourable treatment are required in order to assess the violation of a MFN treatment clause.\"49\n\nUNCTAD \"Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment,\" Exh. CL-1, p. 24.\n\n3.3.50.\n\nThis position was followed in *Daimler,* where the tribunal there emphasised the need to apply an objective standard of comparison and refused to \"endorse the Claimant\u2019s proposed use of the MFN clause unless it could determine that the dispute resolution provisions of Article 10 of the German-Argentine BIT (the \u2018Basic Treaty\u2019) are objectively less favourable than those of Article X of the Chilean-Argentine BIT (\u2018the Comparator Treaty\u2019).\"50\n\n*Daimler,* Exh. RL-28, \u00b6 244.\n\n3.3.51.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant\u2019s assertion that the direct access to ICSID arbitration offered under the Swiss-Turkmenistan BIT is \"undeniably more favourable\" than the dispute settlement mechanism provided for in the BIT is not sufficient to establish that the dispute resolution mechanism found in Article VII.2 is \"objectively less favourable\" than the one provided in Article VIII of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT.\n\n3.3.52.\n\nAs the *ICS* tribunal found:\n\n*\"Although there are costs and delay involved in litigating before the Argentine courts if this fails to achieve a resolution, in many circumstances, this may be more favourable than direct access to international arbitration after only six months of amicable negotiations.* *The Tribunal therefore does not find that Lithuanian investors are necessarily accorded more favourable treatment as compared to the UK investor in Argentina.*  *Accepting that \u2018access to international arbitration has been a fundamental and constant desideratum for investment protection\u2019 does not change this result**.\"51 (Respondent\u2019s emphasis)*\n\n*ICS,* Exh. RL-18, \u00b6 323.\n\n***Direct Access to ICSID Arbitration by Means of the MFN Clause Creates a New Dispute Resolution Mechanism***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.3.53.\n\nRespondent says that Claimant\u2019s argument, that its contended for use of the MFN provision does not create a new dispute resolution mechanism for the BIT, is invalidated by a simple comparison of the dispute resolution mechanism in the BIT and that in the Comparator BIT.\n\n***Object and Purpose of the BIT Cannot Defeat Contracting Parties\u2019 Choice for Disputes First to be Submitted to Local Courts***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.3.54.\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimant\u2019s assertions - that \"denying the Claimant direct access to international arbitration would thwart the object and purpose of the BIT\"52 as \"direct access to international arbitration is an important element of the protection afforded to investors\"53 - cannot prevail over the text of Article VII.2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, Title III.C, p. 22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 50.\n\n3.3.55.\n\nAs was pointed out by the *Daimler* tribunal, BITs \"strike a delicate balance among their various internal policy considerations.\"54 And, as the *Telenor* tribunal held, a tribunal\u2019s task is \"not to displace, by reference to general policy considerations concerning investor protection, the dispute resolution mechanism specifically negotiated by the parties.\"55\n\n*Daimler,* Exh. RL-28, \u00b6 164.\n\n*Telenor,* Exh. RL-32, \u00b6 95.\n\n3.3.56.\n\nFaced with the argument that compliance with the 18-month prior recourse requirement provided under the Germany-Argentina BIT would defeat the purpose of the BIT, the *Wintershall* tribunal concluded that:\n\n*\"Undoubtedly, the promotion and protection of investment is an object or purpose of the BIT but that promotion and protection in the Argentina-Germany BIT is to be*  *\u2018on the basis of an agreement* *\u2019 (i.e. on the basis of the terms of the Treaty - the BIT): which could not possibly exclude the provisions of Article 10(2). If the object and purpose had been to have an immediate unrestricted direct access to ICSID arbitration, then inclusion of Article 10(2) would have been otiose and superfluous. Therefore, the assumption and assertion made in this proceeding (and in some decisions of ICSID Tribunals as well), that since the object and purpose of a BIT is to protect and promote investments, unrestricted direct access to ICSID must be presumed, is contrary to the text (and context) of this BIT, i.e., the Argentina-Germany BIT.\"56 (emphasis in original)*\n\n*Wintershall,* Exh. RL-5, \u00b6 155. See also the *Daimler* tribunals\u2019 finding to the same effect that \"... the exact wording of dispute resolution clauses plays a key role, as such clauses are one of the privileged places where the imbalances between the interests of both parties are often precisely defined as a result of the treaty\u2019s negotiation process.\", Exh. RL-28, \u00b6 161.\n\n**3.4 Prior Recourse to Courts of Turkmenistan Not Unavailable or Obviously Futile**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.4.1.\n\nWith respect to Claimant\u2019s futility argument,57Respondent states that this Tribunal must find that recourse to Turkmenistan courts was unavailable or \"obviously futile\" at the time it should have been taken. This is said to be a very stringent test that has been defined as requiring that the local remedy in question be \"patently unavailable\"58 or \"completely ineffective\".59\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Claimant argues that requiring it to seek redress in Respondent\u2019s courts would be both ineffective and otiose. *See* Counter-Memorial, Section III.B, \u00b6\u00b6 38-48.\n\nICS, Exh. RL-18, \u00b6 269.\n\n*Id.*\n\n3.4.2.\n\nRespondent asserts that few investor-state decisions provide guidance for the application of the futility test to the mandatory requirement to submit a dispute to the local courts of the host state.60\n\n*See ICS,* Exh. RL-18. *See also,* *Abaclat and Others v. Argentine Republic (formerly Giovanna A. Beccara and Others v. The Argentine Republic),* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (4 August 2011) ***(\"Abaclat\"),*** Exh. CL-32.\n\n3.4.3.\n\nIn *ICS,* where the tribunal rejected the claimant\u2019s argument that the mandatory 18-month prior recourse requirement would have been futile, the tribunal held:\n\n*\"This is not a case of*  *obvious futility, where the relief sought is patently unavailable within the Argentine legal system* *. There is an open and legitimate debate between the Parties\u2019 experts as to availability of remedies within the Argentine legal system which may have resolved the dispute within 18 months.*  *Therefore, in the absence of even a cursory attempt by the Claimant, the Tribunal simply cannot conclude that recourse to the Argentine courts would have been completely ineffective at resolving the dispute**.\"61 (Respondent\u2019s emphasis)*\n\n*ICS,* Exh.RL-18, \u00b6 269 (internal citations omitted).\n\n3.4.4.\n\nRespondent notes that the \"obvious futility\" test applied by the *ICS* tribunal was inspired from international jurisprudence dealing with the international law rule of exhaustion of local remedies. However, this is not comparable to the present case, in which the obligation to go first to the local courts arises out of the mandatory provision of the BIT, and where Claimant has not taken a single procedural step in Turkmenistan.\n\n3.4.5.\n\nAs the *Maffezini* tribunal pointed out, Article X(3)(a) of the Spain-Argentina BIT \"does not require the exhaustion of domestic remedies as that concept is understood under international law.\"62\n\n*Maffezini,* Exh. CL-18, \u00b6 28. *See also, Siemens,* Exh. CL-15, \u00b6 104, and *Gas Natural,* Exh. CL-19, \u00b6 30.\n\n3.4.6.\n\nIn any event, and as the *Wintershall* tribunal made clear, Article 44 of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility was a \"stipulation of international law applicable between States or State entities,\"63 which is irrelevant in the investor-state context.\n\n*Wintershall,* Exh. RL-5, \u00b6 126.\n\n3.4.7.\n\nIn any event, Respondent contends that the international law rule of exhaustion of all available local remedies presupposes that the claim has at least been brought before the competent local courts, which is not the case here. Here, Claimant has chosen not to submit its dispute to the competent local courts in Turkmenistan and has not taken a single procedural step there prior to submitting this dispute to ICSID.\n\n***Proper Recourse was Available in Turkmenistan***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n3.4.8.\n\nRespondent says that the competent Turkmen court to hear Claimant\u2019s dispute in this case was the Arbitrazh Court of Turkmenistan. Although the legal text governing proceedings before this court guarantee Claimant\u2019s right to legal assistance and timely proceedings, Claimant deliberately chose not to submit this dispute to that court.\n\n3.4.9.\n\nThe Arbitrazh Court has jurisdiction to hear disputes arising out of economic or managerial relations, and most disputes relating to business activities fall within its jurisdiction. The Arbitrazh Court also has exclusive jurisdiction to hear cases involving a foreign, natural or legal person. Moreover, the 2009 Law on Courts states that the Arbitrazh Court is competent to resolve \"matters arising out of international treaties of Turkmenistan.\"64\n\nLaw of Courts of Turkmenistan of 15 August 2009 **(\"Law of Courts\"),** Exh. RL-40, Article 34 (7).\n\n3.4.10.\n\nThe Arbitrazh Procedural Code of Turkmenistan **(\"APC\")65** which, *inter alia,* governs the timing of proceedings, requires that the court must, within five days of receipt, either accept or decline a Statement of Claim. The court then has a maximum of one month to prepare for the hearing, and it must resolve a dispute within two months after a Statement of Claim is filed. If one of the parties is located outside of Turkmenistan, as is the case here, this period can be extended by up to three months. Under exceptional circumstances this period can be extended by up to a six months maximum.\n\nExh. RL-39.\n\n3.4.11.\n\nThe APC is further said to provide for specific guarantees relating to the independence of judges and fair trial in Arbitrazh proceedings. Moreover, interference in the work of the judges of the Arbitrazh Court is prohibited, and its proceedings are governed by adversarial principles and the principle of equality of parties before the law and the court. Except in limited cases, proceedings are to be held in public and the court\u2019s judgements are announced publicly.\n\n***Available Recourse before Respondent\u2019s Courts was not \"Obviously Futile\"***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.4.12.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimant\u2019s futility analysis is limited to broad statements that the Turkmen judiciary lacks independence and that the Turkmen authorities would have a particular aversion to Turkish investors.\n\n3.4.13.\n\nClaimant\u2019s description of the Turkmen political and judicial system is said to be inaccurate and to ignore Turkmenistan\u2019s recent improvements of its institutions in the legal and judicial sphere.\n\n3.4.14.\n\nRespondent argues that the new 2008 Constitution sets forth the principles of independence of judges, guarantees their immunity and prohibits any interference in their work. It also provides that justice is dispensed on the basis of equality and due process. Cases are heard by full benches, trials are public and the right to legal assistance is recognised at all stages of the proceedings.\n\n3.4.15.\n\nThe 2009 Law on Courts, which in some cases goes beyond the provisions of the Constitution, sets out the principle of independence of judges and prohibits any interference in their work, under criminal and administrative penalty. The law also excludes accountability of a judge before state authority or other entities with regard to the cases that he/she handles. The 2009 law also provides basic guarantees of fair trial and due process.\n\n3.4.16.\n\nRespondent points out that these judicial reforms, which were supported by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, have been accompanied by several campaigns of legal training of Turkmen judges.66\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 97.\n\n3.4.17.\n\nIn these circumstances, Claimant\u2019s broad statements regarding the lack of independence of the Turkmen judiciary do not constitute sufficient evidence of the \"patent unavailability\" or \"complete ineffectiveness\" of available recourse before the Arbitrazh Court required for the futility test to be met in this case.\n\n3.4.18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s recognised improvements of its legal and judicial system, notably propelled by the need to secure foreign investment, further invalidate Claimant\u2019s conclusion.\n\n***Allegations of \"Ill-Treatment\" of Turkish Investors is False***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.4.19.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimant relies on two witness statements of Mr Osman Arslan, one of its project managers, and further refers to Mr Omar Faruk Bozbey, a Turkish investor in Turkmenistan, who submitted claims in certain UN Human Rights Committee proceedings. However, rather than proving any lack of independence of the Turkmen judiciary, or any \"particular aversion\" to Turkish investors, Respondent says that the cases of Messrs Bozbey and Arslan prove a different and more logical reality.\n\n3.4.20.\n\nRespondent maintains that the Mary City Court judgement that sentenced Mr Arslan, and the trial transcript, tell a very different story from Claimant\u2019s allegation that Mr Arslan was imprisoned \"without due process.\"67\n\nExh. R-42 and Exh. R-43.\n\n3.4.21.\n\nThe relevant facts are that, after three collapses of scaffolding on 28 June, 13 October and 1 November 2008, at Claimant\u2019s Mary City main mosque construction project (for which Mr Arslan was the Chief Engineer), causing severe injury to no less than 19, and the death of one worker, Mr Arslan was charged with gross violations of Turkmen legal provisions on labour protection, construction norms and occupational safety.\n\n3.4.22.\n\nHis case was heard less than seven months after the last accident by three judges of the Mary City Court in Turkmenistan.\n\n3.4.23.\n\nContrary to what Mr Arslan claims in his witness statement, Respondent points to the record, which indicates that he received a copy of his indictment and fully familiarised himself with it. It is also said to show that he was assisted by an attorney, had the benefit of an interpreter and chose freely to plead guilty after listening to the presiding judge read the indictment and explain its content. Both Mr Arslan and his attorney were given the opportunity to object at each stage of the trial, and his attorney pleaded extenuating circumstances, which were taken into account in the decision. In addition, Mr Arslan made his own statement, expressed regret and asked the judges to \"take into account extenuating circumstances\".\n\n3.4.24.\n\nMr Arslan was found guilty of violating Article 151 of the Criminal Code of Turkmenistan, which sanctions \"accidents resulting from the violation of the safety regulations by an individual... entrusted with... compliance with work safety regulations where his negligence causes harm to the health of another person.\"68\n\nIndictment of Mr Osman Arslan, 16 May 2009, Exh. R-44, pp. 17-19 (of the English translation).\n\n3.4.25.\n\nRespondent says that Mr Arslan recognised his liability for not having applied these basic rules, and stated that he \"failed to assign a corresponding foreman who would be supervising K. Komekov\u2019s work at the workplace\" and also \"failed to designate a supervising employee and no one was put in charge of ensuring the correct use by the workers of the structure used in the execution of the works at height (scaffolding) from which K. Komekov fell, and also of the proper installation of the bottom part and covering sheets.\"69\n\n*Id,* Exh. R-44, p. 5.\n\n3.4.26.\n\nRespondent points out that Claimant, at its own initiative, paid for all hospital and other medical expenses incurred by its employee as a result of the accidents and paid indemnification of 627,200,000 manats to Mr Komekov\u2019s heirs, which is clear evidence of Claimant\u2019s and Mr Arslan\u2019s admission of liability in that case.\n\n3.4.27.\n\nRespondent draws the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the fact that the Mary City Court relied on numerous witnesses and documentary evidence in support of its decision. All of which provided consistent accounts of the tragic events that occurred on the three days in question.\n\n3.4.28.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that Mr Arslan\u2019s two-year sentence of imprisonment was reasonable in the light of the serious nature of the charges, and the fact that the accidents not only caused severe injuries to numerous of Claimant\u2019s employees, but also resulted in the death of one of them. In reaching its conclusion, the Mary City Court took into account extenuating circumstances, including the fact that Mr Arslan admitted his guilt, was being convicted for the first time, and expressed his regret over criminal acts.\n\n3.4.29.\n\nIn sum, Respondent says that nothing in the procedure, the legal basis of the decision or the factual support for that decision and the sentence supports Claimant\u2019s allegation that Mr Arslan was subject to any \"ill-treatment\".\n\n3.4.30.\n\nWith respect to Mr Bozbey\u2019s claim before the UN Human Rights Committee, regarding arbitrary arrest and detention and discrimination, Respondent notes that the Human Rights Committee found them to be \"unsubstantiated\".70 The Committee also noted that Mr Bozbey had also been convicted in accordance with the domestic legislation of Turkmenistan and did not condemn or otherwise criticise his criminal conviction.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 133; Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 46.\n\n3.4.31.\n\nWhile the Committee did consider that Mr Bozbey\u2019s allegations, that the trial was conducted in Turkmen without a Turkmen interpreter and his description of prison conditions, amounted to a violation of the ICCR, Respondent notes that, contrary to Mr Bozbey\u2019s allegation and the ICCR proceedings, court documents indicate that Mr Bozbey was in fact provided with a Turkmen interpreter, and was represented by counsel. Moreover, Mr Bozbey\u2019s own *curriculum vitae* lists Turkmen as one of his languages.\n\n3.4.32.\n\nRespondent also points out that after the UN Committee communicated its views to Turkmenistan, the state launched an investigation of the alleged violations and produced a series of reports describing their findings. These reports established that Mr Bozbey was imprisoned with sanitary facilities, was provided with adequate food and water and often received parcels of food from relatives. He also had access to medical services and facilities, received several visits by family members and that his personal file did not record any complaints regarding his condition of imprisonment. The one report which recognised that prison facilities in the country are over-crowded also described the actions undertaken by the State to correct this deficiency.\n\n3.4.33.\n\nRespondent also points to the recently (February 2012) signed bilateral agreement between Turkey and Turkmenistan on Legal Assistance in Civil and Criminal Matters **(\"Legal Assistance Agreement\").71**\n\nAgreement on the Legal Assistance in Civil and Criminal Matters between Turkmenistan and the Republic of Turkey, dated 29 February 2012, Exh. R-54, Chapter II, sections 1, 3 and 4.\n\n3.4.34.\n\nRespondent says that this Legal Assistance Agreement confirms Turkey\u2019s and Turkmenistan\u2019s mutual acceptance and respect of their respective court proceedings and shows that Turkey does not consider today that proceedings before Turkmenistan\u2019s courts are futile.\n\n3.4.35.\n\nFinally, Respondent points out that this case is the first investor-state arbitration Turkmenistan is facing under a BIT that has a mandatory recourse to local courts provision. For a process to be found to be futile, Respondent submits that it must first be given a chance to work. Here, Respondent states that Claimant cannot point to a single foreign investor who went to the Turkmen courts and who was denied due process or received unfair treatment. There is simply no past record of decisions and therefore no \"repetition of a uniform line of decisions adverse to the alien\" which, according to Claimant\u2019s legal authorities, would support the admission of a futility argument in this case.72\n\nAmerasinghe, *Local Remedies in International Law* (Cambridge University Press) (2004), Exh. CL-28, chapter 8, pp. 206-207.\n\n3.4.36.\n\nRespondent says that it has not yet had the opportunity to show the international community how it would handle investment cases brought to its courts pursuant to a prior recourse requirement under the BIT. However, its desire to stimulate and secure foreign investment gives it a genuine interest in affording fair and effective local remedies to foreign investors operating in Turkmenistan.\n\n**3.5 Post-Hearing Submissions**\n--------------------------------\n\n3.5.1.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s request that the parties set out their positions on the ability of the Tribunal to suspend these proceedings, in the event that the Tribunal concludes that the MFN provision does not encompass the DRPs, and that recourse to the Turkmen courts would not have been futile, Respondent submitted that it had demonstrated clearly that the Article VII.2 requirement of prior recourse to the local courts was a precondition to the Contracting Parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration and constitutes a jurisdictional requirement.\n\n3.5.2.\n\nRespondent referred to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention which states plainly that treaty provisions requiring prior recourse to local courts are conditions to the State\u2019s consent to arbitrate and, therefore, to the jurisdiction of ICSID and the Tribunal.\n\n3.5.3.\n\nIn pertinent part, Article 26 provides:\n\n*\"... A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial*  *remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention* *.\" (Respondent\u2019s emphasis)*\n\n3.5.4.\n\nRespondent points to the supportive conclusions to this effect by the tribunals in *ICS, Wintershall, Impregilo* and to *dicta* in *Maffezini.*\n\n3.5.5.\n\nRespondent submits that there is nothing in the ordinary meaning of Article VII.2 of the BIT that would lead one to view the mandatory requirement of prior recourse to local courts as a mere matter of \"admissibility\".\n\n3.5.6.\n\nSince Claimant\u2019s admitted failure to comply with Article VII.2 deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction, Respondent submits that the Tribunal simply has no power to suspend these proceedings.\n\n**3.6 Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n3.6.1.\n\nIn summary, this Tribunal is said to lack jurisdiction to hear the merits of this dispute due to Claimant\u2019s failure to comply with the mandatory requirement of prior submission of the dispute to Turkmenistan\u2019s courts under Article VII.2 of the BIT. As a result, Respondent requests this Tribunal to render an Award holding that it has no jurisdiction to hear the merits of the disputes and ordering Claimant to pay all costs related to this phase of the arbitration.\n\n**4. CLAIMANT\u2019S CASE**\n----------------------\n\n**4.1 Summary**\n---------------\n\n4.1.1.\n\nClaimant\u2019s overall position is that the Tribunal\u2019s 7 May 2012 Decision has no effect on the jurisdictional issues in this case for two principal reasons. First, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this dispute by virtue of the BIT\u2019s MFN clause. Second, even if the BIT did not include Article II, mandatory prior recourse to Respondent\u2019s courts by Claimant under Article VII.2 of the BIT would be ineffective and otiose.\n\n**4.2 Jurisdiction is Provided by Operation of the BIT\u2019s MFN Provision**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.2.1.\n\nClaimant says that the Tribunal has jurisdiction by virtue of the MFN clause contained in Article II.2 of the BIT which reads:\n\n*\"Each Party shall accord to these investments, once established, treatment no less favourable than that accorded in similar situations to investments of its investors or to investments of investors of any third country, whichever is the most favourable.\"73*\n\nBIT, Art. II.2, Exhs. C-l, R-2.\n\n4.2.2.\n\nWhen the Contracting Parties entered into the BIT, Claimant maintains it thereby acquired the rights which fall within the scope of the subject-matter of Article II.2, and Respondent agreed unconditionally to accord Claimant those rights.\n\n***Claimant\u2019s Right to Choose International Arbitration is Not Subject to a Mandatory Recourse Precondition***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.2.3.\n\nClaimant argues that the consent of the BIT\u2019s Contracting Parties to arbitrate before this Tribunal has been established by virtue of Article II of the BIT and Article 8 of the Agreement on the Promotion and reciprocal Protection of Investments entered into by Respondent and Switzerland on 15 May 2008 **(\"Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT\").** Respondent agreed to Article II.2 unconditionally, and cannot seek to import conditions from Article VII.2, the dispute resolution section of the BIT, into Article II.2.\n\n4.2.4.\n\nClaimant asserts that dispute resolution before a neutral forum, such as the Tribunal, clearly falls within the scope of \"treatment\" and, thus, the protection offered unconditionally by Respondent to investments made by Turkish investors under the BIT.74\n\nRespondent has not put in issue at this stage Claimant\u2019s status as a qualifying Turkish investor in Turkmenistan, and it is assumed for the purposes of this Award\n\n4.2.5.\n\nIn the result, Article II.2 permits Claimant to rely upon DRPs contained in other BITs concluded by Respondent, to the extent that they provide more favourable treatment to investors than those included in the BIT.\n\n4.2.6.\n\nAs explained by Professor Schreuer in his Commentary on the ICSID Convention:\n\n*\"... an MFN clause [...] is intended to endow its beneficiary with rights that are additional to the rights contained in the basic treaty. The meaning of an MFN clause is that whoever is entitled to rely on it be granted rights accruing from a third party treaty even if these rights clearly go beyond the basic treaty.\"75*\n\nChistopher Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Anthony Sinclair, *The* *ICSID*  *CONVENTION'.*  *A*  *COMMENTARY* (Cambridge University Press) (2009), Exh.

C-2.\n\n4.2.8.\n\nArticle 8 of that treaty provides:\n\n***\"Article 8***\n\n***Disputes between a Contracting party and an investor of the other Contracting Party***\n\n*(1) For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, consultations will take place between the parties concerned.*\n\n*(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months from the date of request for consultations, the investor may submit the dispute for settlement to:*\n\n*(b) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes* *(ICSID) provided for by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment* *Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington, on 18 March 1965 (hereinafter the \"Convention of Washington\"); or*\n\n*(b) an ad hoc-arbitral [sic] tribunal which, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties to the dispute, shall be established under the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).*\n\n*(3) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute to international conciliation or arbitration.*\n\n*(4) The Contracting Party which is party to the dispute shall at no time whatsoever during the procedures assert as a defence its immunity or the fact that the investor has received a compensation [sic] under an insurance contract covering the whole or part of the incurred damage.*\n\n*(5) Neither Contracting Party shall pursue through diplomatic channels a dispute submitted to international arbitration unless the other Contracting Party does not abide by and comply with the arbitral award.*\n\n*(6) The arbitral award shall be final and binding for the parties to the dispute and shall be executed according to national law.\"*\n\n4.2.9.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s 7 May 2012 Decision, Claimant notes that claims made against Respondent relating to a Turkish investment first need to be submitted to Turkmenistan\u2019s courts before they can be submitted to an ICSID tribunal. By contrast, disputes between Swiss nationals and Respondent about investments made by Swiss investors in Turkmenistan do not first need to be submitted to Turkmenistan\u2019s courts.\n\n4.2.10.\n\nIt follows, argues Claimant, that investments made by Swiss investors in Turkmenistan are treated more favourably than investments made by Turkish investors in Turkmenistan. Therefore, the MFN clause in the BIT enables Claimant to have direct access to ICSID arbitration, without the additional requirement that it first submit its dispute to Respondent\u2019s courts.\n\n4.2.11.\n\nClaimant asserts that it is \"almost common knowledge\" that the right to submit a claim before an independent arbitral tribunal, rather than the courts of the host state, is indeed a fundamental basis of investment protection principles. In these circumstances, it should not be difficult to conclude that the direct recourse to an independent forum for the resolution of the disputes between an investor and the host state is a more favourable treatment than the conditional recourse to such forum.\n\n4.2.12.\n\nTo the extent that Respondent relies on the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of Article VII.2, to argue that Turkmenistan\u2019s consent to arbitrate is conditioned by Claimant\u2019s prior recourse to its courts, Claimant says that the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of Article VII.2 has no bearing on the effectiveness of other international obligations of Respondent, including those assumed under BIT\u2019s MFN clause.\n\n4.2.13.\n\nClaimant contends that awards, decisions of international courts and tribunals and commentaries are consistent on the point that a state should not be allowed to apply procedural requirements to some foreign investors and not to others. It says, in such circumstances, that \"the prevailing view seems to be the one that allows the investor to by-pass... [the] procedural requirement.\"77\n\nGuido S.

CL-10, p. 28.\n\n4.2.14.\n\nAs recognised by the *Maffezini* tribunal, direct access to international arbitration is a crucial element of the protection afforded to foreign investments under BITs:\n\n*\"there are good reasons to conclude that today dispute settlement arrangements are inextricably related to the protection of foreign investors.\"78*\n\n*Maffezini,* Exh. CL-18, \u00b6 54.\n\n4.2.15.\n\nClaimant relies on similar holdings by tribunals in *Gas Natural, Siemens, Suez-InterAguas, Suez-AWG* and *Hochtief'79*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 55 and 56.\n\n4.2.16.\n\nAmongst others, Claimant points to the decision by the *Telefonica* tribunal, which had to decide whether the MFN treatment could free a Spanish investor from the obligation of resorting to the Argentinean courts before commencing an ICSID arbitration. That tribunal emphasised this principle:\n\n*\"The issue here is not, however, the extension of ICSID arbitration beyond what is provided for in the Argentina-Spain BIT by virtue of the reference to another BIT under the MFN clause. The issue is whether submission of the dispute to ICSID under the BIT may be exempted from the precondition of submitting the claim to the domestic courts of the host State, thanks to the application of the MFN clause [...] [T]he Tribunal considers that this requirement pertains to the \u2018treatment\u2019 that Argentina applies, \u2018within its territory\u2019 to Spanish investors wishing to complain before an ICSID arbitral tribunal about a breach of some substantive provision of the BIT in respect of their investment in Argentina. Therefore, such a requirement falls within the purview of the MFN clause [...] It follows that if such a requirement is not applied to Chilean (and other foreign) investors by Argentina under the respective BITs, then this requirement properly is inapplicable to Spanish investors.\"80*\n\n*Telefonica S.A. v.

CL-13, \u00b6 92 (\"It is evident that some claimants may have tried to extend and MFN clause beyond appropriate limits. For example, the situation in *Plama* involving an attempt to create consent to ICSID arbitration when none existed was foreseen in the possible exceptions to the operation of the MFN clause in *Maffezini.* But cases like *Plama* do not justify depriving the MFN clause of its legitimate meaning or purpose in a particular case. The MFN clause is an important element to ensure that foreign investors are treated on a basis of parity with other foreign investors and with national investors when they invest abroad.\")\n\n4.2.17.\n\nClaimant adopts the reasoning applied by the *Siemens* tribunal which allowed *Siemens* to rely on the dispute settlement provisions of the Chile-Argentina (Comparator) BIT based on the MFN clause based in the (Basic) Germany-Argentina BIT.\n\n4.2.18.\n\nIn that case, Argentina objected to the jurisdiction of the tribunal on the basis of the dispute settlement provisions in the Germany-Argentina BIT, which *prima facie* obliged *Siemens* to submit its dispute to the Argentinean courts for a period of 18 months before initiating arbitration proceedings. Although *Siemens* invoked the MFN clause of the Germany-Argentina BIT, to import the arguably more favourable dispute resolution provisions of the Chile-Argentina BIT, Argentina contended that settlement of disputes was not part of the protection accorded to investors, and thus not covered by the MFN\u2019s standard.\n\n4.2.19.\n\nThere, as does Claimant here, *Siemens* argued that the MFN clause was broadly worded, simply referring to \"treatment\". The MFN clause also contained certain exclusions relating to customs or economic unions, and of free trade areas. Claimant draws attention to the *Siemens* tribunal\u2019s conclusion that \"the need for exceptions confirms the generality of the meaning of treatment... rather than setting limits beyond what is said in the exceptions.\"81\n\n*Siemens,* Exh. CL-15, \u00b6 85.\n\n4.2.20.\n\nClaimant says that the same reasoning applies in this case. The fact that the Contracting Parties agreed, in Article II.4, to exclude applications of the MFN clause in relation to \"any existing or future customs unions, regional economic organization or similar international agreements\" and to \"taxation\" confirms that all other procedural and substantive protections were intended to be covered by the MFN clause.\n\n4.2.21.\n\nClaimant argues that this is a straightforward application of the principle *expressio unius est exclusif) alterius.*\n\n4.2.22.\n\nClaimant refers to the tribunal\u2019s decision in *National Grid,* another Argentinean case, which held that, since dispute resolution was not listed among the exceptions to the application of the relevant MFN clause, it implicitly fell within the scope of the MFN clause.82\n\nThe tribunal in *National Grid* referred explicitly to this principle, citing Bernhardt\u2019s Encyclopedia of Public International Law, which confirms that \"[b]y its nature, the unconditional [MFN] clause, unless otherwise agreed, attracts all favors extended on whatever grounds by the granting State to the third State.\" *National Grid,* Exh. CL-13, \u00b6 82 and FN 67.\n\n4.2.23.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s argument that the Article II.4 exceptions deal with the direct treatment of foreign investments, which shows that the word \"treatment\" refers to the substantive rights accorded to the foreign investors as opposed to dispute resolution provisions in the treaty, Claimant relies on Judge Brower\u2019s dissent in *Daimler* in which he affirmed that international agreements may contain dispute settlement provisions and for this reason we may not conclude that the list of exceptions contain only substantive rights.\n\n4.2.24.\n\nClaimant also says that in none of the BITs signed by Turkmenistan is there any clear exclusion of DRPs from the scope of MFN treatment. On the other hand, Turkey is said to have a practice of indicating specifically if it intends to exclude the DRPs from the scope of the MFN clause.\n\n4.2.25.\n\nClaimant refers to Turkey\u2019s 2011 BIT with Azerbaijan, Article III.5 (c) of which reads:\n\n*\"Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply in respect of dispute settlement provisions between an investor and the hosting Contracting Party laid down simultaneously by this Agreement and by another similar international agreement to which one of the Contracting Parties is signatory.\"83*\n\nAgreement between the Government of the Republic of Turkey and the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Reciprocal Protection and Promotion of Investments, done in Izmir, 25 October 2011, Exh. C-28.\n\n4.2.26.\n\nClaimant also points to BITs between Turkey and the UK and Turkmenistan and the UK as being confirmatory of this point. Article 3.3 of the Turkmenistan-UK BIT states that:\n\n*\"For the avoidance of doubt*  *it is confirmed that* *the treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions of* *Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement [including DRP of Article VIII].\"84 (Claimant\u2019s emphasis)*\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Turkmenistan for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 9 February 1995, Exh. C-7, Art. 3.3; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 108.\n\n4.2.27.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s argument based on the absence of the term \"all matters\" to conclude on a narrow scope of MFN treatment, Claimant says that none of the BITs concluded by Turkey or Turkmenistan contain the \"all matters\" language. This proves that those parties, not only in terms of their present BIT, but in their complete BIT practice consider the word \"treatment\" is necessarily broad enough to guarantee MFN treatment to DRPs.\n\n4.2.28.\n\nClaimant again relies on Judge Brower\u2019s dissenting opinion in the *Daimler* case, dealing with the scope of the definition of \"treatment\", where he states:\n\n*\"In this connection, the Award does not address adequately the fact that at least nine prior awards, either through detailed analysis or by necessary implication, have concluded that \u2018treatment\u2019 is broad enough to include dispute settlement...\"85*\n\nDissenting Opinion of Judge Charles N. Brower in *Daimler v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1) (15 August 2012), Exh. CL-38, \u00b6 18.\n\n***The BIT\u2019s MFN Provision Does Not Create a New Dispute Resolution Mechanism for the BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.2.29.\n\nClaimant says that a proper understanding of Article II.2 does not require the Tribunal to consider whether it is providing for a dispute resolution mechanism that was not agreed upon or contemplated by the Contracting Parties to the BIT.\n\n4.2.30.\n\nThis is because the Contracting Parties already contemplated that disputes with Turkish investors could be resolved by an ICSID arbitration tribunal. The existence of Article II.2 means that Respondent has agreed, unconditionally, to put no additional hurdles to impede access to ICSID by Turkish nationals than there is in place for Swiss nationals to access ICSID. Were it to reach a different conclusion, Claimant says that the Tribunal would be allowing Respondent to accord Turkish nationals a treatment inferior to that which it accords to Swiss nationals, in violation of its obligations under the BIT.\n\n***Ejusdem Generis does not Preclude the Import of Dispute Resolution Procedures from Another BIT***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.2.31.\n\nClaimant accepts that in accordance with the *ejusdem generis* principle, an MFN provision may only attract the rights conferred by other treaties which belong to the same matter or class of matter as to which clause itself relates.86 In this case, however, because the BIT and the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT provide substantial protection to investments and also contain similar DRPs, they belong to the same class of matter.87 It follows, says Claimant, that if a more favourable dispute resolution method is provided to an investor of a third state, Turkish or Turkmen investors may and should benefit from these provisions in accordance with the MFN treatment.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 67.\n\n*Id.*\n\n4.2.32.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s argument that the Contracting Parties\u2019 intention was to exclude DRPs from the scope of the MFN provision, Claimant says that Respondent submits no clear evidence to prove such argument. To the contrary, in the BIT, the Contracting Parties are said clearly to have intended to include DRPs in the MFN provision, since they did not limit the scope of the latter with any additional wording including territorial implications.88\n\nBy contrast in *Daimler,* the tribunal concluded that such limitation of the MFN treatment with an additional term of \"[investment] in its territory\" proves that the parties excluded dispute resolution provisions from the scope of the MFN provision. Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 79.\n\n***Principle of Contemporaneity not Determinative***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n4.2.33.\n\nWith respect to Respondent\u2019s citation of the World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investments of 1992, to explain that the word \"treatment\" does not cover dispute resolution provisions, Claimant refers to the *Daimler* tribunal\u2019s conclusion that this document is an instrument of soft law, and does not \"purport to shed any direct light on the meaning of the word \u2018treatment\u2019 as used in the German-Argentine BIT\u2019s MFN clauses\"; \"it is not of a sufficient weight to be outcome determinative.\"89\n\n*Daimler,* Exh. RL-28, \u00b6 224.\n\n***Respondent\u2019s \"Ineffectiveness \" Argument***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n4.2.34.\n\nClaimant argues that the Contracting Parties\u2019 agreement to give investors a choice to claim their rights before local courts or international arbitration is useful, regardless of any MFN rights, for Turkish and Turkmen investors who may prefer to claim their rights before local courts instead of arbitral tribunals.\n\n***Alleged Differences in Nature/Size of Swiss and Turkish Investors are Irrelevant***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.2.35.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent\u2019s claim that Swiss and Turkish investors are not comparable in nature and size, and therefore that investment protection level afforded should be different, is without merit.\n\n4.2.36.\n\nBoth Swiss and Turkish companies that invest in Turkmenistan qualify as \"investors\" under international investment law principles. The size and nature of their commercial activities and of their investments is irrelevant and does not change the fact that there is an investment by an investor.\n\n4.2.37.\n\nClaimant argues that it would be entirely inappropriate to attribute different levels of investment protection for different kinds and sizes of investments in a host country.\n\n4.2.38.\n\nIn any event, Claimant refers not only to the Swiss-Turkmenistan BIT but several others. In addition to the Swiss-Turkmenistan BIT, the provisions of each of the German-Turkmenistan, UAE-Turkmenistan and Pakistan-Turkmenistan BITs establish more favourable treatment for Claimant than those found in Article VII.2 of the BIT.90 Like the Swiss-Turkmenistan BIT, they also serve as a basis for the purposes of the MFN protection to be granted to Claimant\u2019s right for arbitration.\n\nNone of the referenced comparator BITs require reference to Respondent\u2019s local courts prior to the initiation of arbitration proceedings. *See* Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 124-28.\n\n**4.3 Mandatory Recourse to Turkmenistan\u2019s Courts would be Ineffective and Otiose**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.3.1.\n\nClaimant says that it is well established under international law that the requirement to exhaust local remedies should be disregarded when, in reality, no remedy is available and any attempt at exhaustion would be futile. In the circumstances of this case, the requirement for prior recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan ought not to be enforced by the Tribunal.\n\n4.3.2.\n\nClaimant refers to the Commentary to the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility **(\"ILC Commentary\"),** Article 44 of which provides that:\n\n*\"Only those local remedies which are \u2018available and effective\u2019 have to be exhausted before invoking the responsibility of a State.*  *The mere existence on paper* *of remedies under the internal law of a State does not impose a requirement to make use of those remedies in every case.\"91 (Claimant\u2019s emphasis)*\n\nInternational Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries* (2001), Exh.

CL-27, pp. 5-17.\n\n4.3.3.\n\nThus, the requirement to exhaust or pursue local remedies is flexible, not rigid or absolute. In the words of Sir Hersch Lauterpacht:\n\n*\"For the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies is not a purely technical or rigid rule. It is a rule which international tribunals have applied with a considerable degree of elasticity. In particular, they have refused to act upon it in cases in which there are, in fact,*  *no effective remedies available owing to the law of the State concerned or the conditions prevailing in it* *.\"92 (Claimant\u2019s emphasis)*\n\n*Case of Certain Norwegian Loans* (France v. Norway), International Court of Justice, Separate Opinion of Judge Sir Hersch Lauterpacht (6 July 1957), Exh. CL-23, p. 39.\n\n4.3.4.\n\nClaimant argues that the mandatory recourse requirement found in Article VII.2 is analogous to the rule of exhaustion of local remedies. As expressed by the *ICS* tribunal:\n\n*\"[T]he 18-month litigation prerequisite is not a requirement of exhaustion of local remedies in the technical sense. It cannot, however, be presumed that the prerequisite does not share many of the same rationales behind the local remedies rule.\"93*\n\nICS, Exh. RL-18, \u00b6 261.\n\n***Turkmenistan Lacks an Independent Judiciary***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n4.3.5.\n\nClaimant asserts that Turkmenistan\u2019s judges and prosecutors are appointed to short periods in office, directly and personally by the President and refers to the United Nations Human Rights Committee\u2019s concern at the lack of an independent judiciary in Turkmenistan.94\n\nUnited Nations Human Rights Committee *\"Consideration of reports submitted by States parties under article 40 of the Covenant-* Concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee on Turkmenistan\", Advance unedited version (March 2012), Exh. C-9, \u00b6 13.\n\n4.3.6.\n\nClaimant also refers to Transparency International\u2019s ranking of Turkmenistan as 177th out of 183 surveyed country on its Corruption Perception Index for 2011 and to disparaging remarks made by Turkmenistan\u2019s President Berdimuhamedow about Turkish foreign investors:\n\n*\"It would be good if they could deliver the project. But regarding the other dishonourable men, the Turkish companies, it seems they are going to just take our money and not complete the job properly. All of them should be subject to the internal investigation process as an internal security issue and a careful inspection of them should be carried out. I did not know whether they have finished the job or not, but as I have said previously, they should be companies which work honourably. Have you understood? Sit, now!\"95*\n\nTranscript of the video recording \"President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow addressing government officials II\" (00:47-01:35), Exh. C-13.\n\n4.3.7.\n\nClaimant argues that this statement confirms that any requirement by the Tribunal that Claimant resort to Respondent\u2019s courts would serve no purpose as it would not provide for an effective resolution of the dispute or a fair result.\n\n***Those Who Choose to Oppose the Government or State Organs in Local Courts are Ill-Treated***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.3.8.\n\nClaimant says that the inadvisability of mandating recourse to Respondent\u2019s courts is underlined by Turkmenistan\u2019s treatment of those who choose or must choose to be adverse to the government or its organs.\n\n4.3.9.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch:\n\n*\"[t]he government [of Turkmenistan] threatens, harasses, and imprisons those who openly investigate abuses or question its policies, however modestly.\"96*\n\nHuman Rights Watch, *Submission on Turkmenistan to the UN Human Rights Committee* (14 March 2012), p. 1, Exh. C-14.\n\n4.3.10.\n\nClaimant exhibits and relies upon excerpts of a report prepared by the UN\u2019s Human Rights Committee on a complaint by Mr Omar Faruk Bozbey, a Turkish investor in Turkmenistan, on a complaint submitted by him to the UN Human Rights Committee.97 Bozbey\u2019s claim was that he was charged with economic offences when he refused to pay a bribe, detained, held in degrading and humiliating conditions and subjected to court proceedings conducted in the Turkmen language which he did not understand.\n\n*Omar Faruk Bozbey v. Turkmenistan,* Communication No. 1530/2006, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/100/D/1530/2006 (2010), Exh. C-16, p. 3.\n\n4.3.11.\n\nClaimant also says that it has experienced firsthand such acts by Respondent, and relies on the statement of Mr Osman Arslan, one of Kili\u00e7\u2019s project managers in Turkmenistan, relating to charges he faced in connection with several occupational accidents at a Kili\u00e7 work site in Mary, Turkmenistan.\n\n4.3.12.\n\nFinally, Claimant contends in its submissions that it was unable to find a single Turkmen lawyer who was willing to testify against the government of Turkmenistan. It is said that, on each occasion the refusal was followed by the same explanation: a fear for the security of the lawyer and his/her family of reprisals by Respondent. Claimant also submits it has communicated about this with other investors with claims against Respondent and understands that its experience is universal.98\n\nThe Tribunal notes that these factual assertions are made in the form of submissions of counsel. However, no witness statement or documentary evidence is provided in support.\n\n4.3.13.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s assertion that the 2009 Law on Courts enables the trial of matters arising out of international treaties of Turkmenistan before the Arbitrazh Court, Claimant says that Respondent, not having previously included the resolution of such matters within the jurisdiction of the Arbitrazh Court, this constitutes a blatant attempt to deprive investors from bringing their claims before ICSID or any other mechanism by amending the Arbitrazh Procedural Code in 2009.\n\n4.3.14.\n\nClaimant further argues that it is not in a position to verify whether it is a fact that the Arbitrazh Court was actually able to try the matters arising out of Turkmenistan\u2019s international treaties as a result of the 2009 amendment.99\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 148.\n\n4.3.15.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s references to provisions of the Turkmenistan Constitution and the APC and the 2009 Law on Courts as a guarantee to due process, Claimant argues that such rules contain procedural defects. Moreover, enactment of these rules and legislation is not a guarantee of due process.100\n\n*See also,* ILC Commentary, Article 44, \u00b6 5, Exh. CL-25.\n\n4.3.16.\n\nClaimant suggests that references in \"Wikileaks cables\" introduced by Respondent are confirmatory:\n\n*\"It remains to be seen whether*  *the provisions of the new laws are just window dressing intended to give appearance of genuine reform,* *or whether current practices change in a positive direction as a result of the laws\u2019 implementation.*\n\n*Although the statement in the law that judges are independent gives hope for some improvements to the legal system, implementation will be a challenge as old habits and practices die hard.*  *Given the top-down structure of decision-making in Turkmenistan, it is hard to imagine that judges would make decisions based solely on facts of a case, especially if a state interest is involved. Influence and bribery will also remain powerful forces.* *Still, the first step in introducing better practices is creating the proper legal framework, followed by the long-term task of* *implementation through education and enforcement that could eventually lead to judicial independence.\"101 (Claimant\u2019s emphasis)*\n\nCable ref. 09ASHGABAT1080 \"Turkmenistan: A Step Towards Establishing an Independent Judiciary,\" Exh. C-34, pp. 1-3.\n\n4.3.17.\n\nClaimant also says that Respondent\u2019s argument that the 2009 Law of Courts attempted to provide independence of judges is invalidated by the UN Report of the Committee Against Torture which states:\n\n*\"The Committee*  *is deeply concerned at the ineffective functioning of justice system, apparently caused in part by the lack of independence of the procuracy and judiciary,* *as was noted by the Secretary-General in 2006 (A/61/489, para. 46). The Committee regrets that*  *responsibility for the appointment and promotion of judges rests with the President, which jeopardizes the independence of the judiciary.**\"102 (Claimant\u2019s emphasis)*\n\nUN Committee Against Torture, *Consideration of reports submitted by State parties under article 19 of the Convention - Concluding Observations of the Committee Against Torture\"* (15 June 2011), Exh. C-17, p. 4.\n\n4.3.18.\n\nIn short, Claimant argues that Respondent\u2019s assertion of improvement of the judiciary has not been substantiated.\n\n4.3.19.\n\nIn summary, Claimant says that the evidentiary record reveals:\n\n(a) reports of a severe lack of promotion and protection of human rights, the rule of law, due process and fair trials in Turkmenistan;\n\n(b) any positive developments in terms of Turkmenistan\u2019s judiciary have only recently been initiated and are at an initial level;\n\n(c) to the extent that there have been such developments, they have been organised and initiated by foreign institutions; and\n\n(d) such attempts as have been reported have been ineffectual.\n\n4.3.20.\n\nClaimant therefore says it has established that recourse to the local courts of Respondent was unavailable and would have been futile at the time the dispute arose.\n\n4.3.21.\n\nClaimant, and possibly other Turkish investors, who have taken their disputes against Turkmenistan before ICSID tribunals will be utterly deprived of their right to fair trial and due process before an independent and impartial tribunal should this tribunal render a decision that it has no jurisdiction to hear this dispute.\n\n***Denying Claimant Direct Access to ICSID Arbitration Would Thwart the Object and Purpose of the BIT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.3.22.\n\nClaimant submits that the object and purpose of the BIT is the promotion and protection of investments. A crucial component in the effectiveness of that protection is said to be access to fair and efficient means of dispute settlement.\n\n4.3.23.\n\nIn light of the condition of Turkmenistan\u2019s court system, insistence upon resort by Claimant to the courts of Turkmenistan would offer no reasonable possibility of bringing a fair resolution to this dispute. Thus, depriving the Claimant of direct access to international arbitration, it is said, would clearly be contrary to the object and purpose of the BIT.\n\n***Revisitation of Tribunal\u2019s Finding on Meaning and Effect of Article VII.2***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.3.24.\n\nFinally, in its Rejoinder, Claimant revisits the question of whether Article VII.2 calls for mandatory recourse to Respondent\u2019s courts, again drawing attention to the cover note of the presentation to the Turkish parliament which is said to establish the optional right for the investors to choose to submit disputes before the local courts.103 Claimant makes these assertions to counter Respondent\u2019s arguments that mandatory recourse is a precondition to Respondent\u2019s Consent to Arbitrate. The Tribunal notes that this question was decided finally in its May 2012 Decision.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 16-25.\n\n**4.4 Post-Hearing Submissions**\n--------------------------------\n\n4.4.1.\n\nIn its post-hearing submissions, Claimant dealt with the Tribunal\u2019s question concerning its ability to suspend these proceedings - the admissibility v. jurisdiction question.104\n\nThe question of admissibility v. jurisdiction had not been raised directly in the parties\u2019 written exchanges prior to the December 2012 hearing. It was only then that Claimant\u2019s counsel argued that non-compliance with Article VII.2\u2019s prior recourse requirement should be seen as a matter of \"ripeness\" or \"admissibility\" of Claimant\u2019s claim, and not as a matter of jurisdiction. *See* Transcript of 7 December 2012 hearing, pp. 78/12 -84/10, 178-9-17.\n\n4.4.2.\n\nClaimant reasserts its proposition that at the time it accepted Respondent\u2019s offer to arbitrate, there was a valid and unconditional consent to arbitrate. It thus maintains that its failure to refer its disputes to Respondent\u2019s courts goes only to the admissibility of its claims, and not to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.105\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n\n4.4.3.\n\nReferring to cases such as *Bayinder, Ethyl, Alps Finance, Abaclat* and *Western NIS,* Claimant submits that investment treaty jurisprudence has mostly treated requirements for notice, negotiation periods, and prior local litigation as admissibility requirements that may be perfected at a later stage in the proceedings, after the application initiating arbitration proceedings has been filed.\n\n4.4.4.\n\nClaimant accepts that a tribunal which has \"no jurisdiction cannot do anything but reject the claim because of a lack of jurisdiction.\"106 Nevertheless, it contends that a defect which is perfectible affords a tribunal the discretion to suspend a hearing in order to allow a claimant to \"perfect\" the dispute and make the claim admissible.107\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 19.\n\n*Id.*\n\n**5. TRIBUNAL\u2019S APPROACH TO THE SINGLE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**5.1 Issues to be Addressed**\n------------------------------\n\n5.1.1.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that there are three principal substantive questions to be addressed in relation to the single jurisdictional question that is now before the Tribunal. They are:\n\n(a) is Article VII.2\u2019s requirement for prior recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan a condition of Turkmenistan\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration;\n\n(b) does the BIT\u2019s Article II.2 MFN provision encompass the BIT\u2019s DRPs contained in Article VII.2, so as to permit Claimant to rely on the DRPs of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT; and\n\n(c) in the event that Claimant is not exempted from the mandatory prior recourse provisions of Article VII.2 by reason of the operation of Article II.2 MFN provision, is it otherwise exempted because compliance with the provisions of Article VII.2 would have been ineffective or futile?\n\n**5.2 Applicable Principles of Treaty Interpretation**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.2.1.\n\nThe parties accept that meaning and scope of the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT are to be understood/interpreted in accordance with the rules of interpretation set out in the relevant articles of the VCLT.\n\n5.2.2.\n\nArticles 31 and 32 of VCLT provide as follows:\n\n*\"Article 31*\n\n*General rule of interpretation*\n\n*1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n*2. The context for the purpose of interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:*\n\n*(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;*\n\n*(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.*\n\n*3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:*\n\n*(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;*\n\n*(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;*\n\n*(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable to the relations between the parties.*\n\n*4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended:*\n\n*Article 32*\n\n*Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\n*Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the prepatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:*\n\n*(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or*\n\n*(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"*\n\n5.2.3.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the VCLT comprises three separate principles, as noted in the International Law Commission\u2019s Commentary to its Final Draft Articles:\n\n*\"the first - interpretation in good faith - both directly from the rule pacta sunt servanda. The second principle is the very essence of the* *textual approach: the parties are to be presumed to have that intention which appears from the ordinary meaning of the terms used by them.* *The third principle is one both of common sense and good faith; the ordinary meaning of the term is not to be determined in the abstract but in the context of the treaty and in the light of its object and purpose.* *These principles have repeatedly been affirmed by the Court [i.e., the ICJ].\"108*\n\n*Yearbook of the International Law Commission,* Vol. II, Commentary to Draft article 27 (1966), \u00b6. 12, (Article 31(1) of the VCLT was previously 27(1) of the draft convention).\n\n5.2.4.\n\nAs to the second of these principles (interpretation in accordance with the ordinary meaning of a term), various commentators have noted that this is not merely an exercise in uncovering the mere literal meaning of a term.109\n\n*See, e.g.,* Anthony Sinclair, *The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,* 2nd ed. (1984), p. 121; Bin Cheng *General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals* (1953), p. 114.\n\n5.2.5.\n\nAs to the third principle of Article 31(1), the Special Rapporteur of the International Law Commission noted that \"the \u2018ordinary meaning\u2019 of terms cannot be properly determined without reference to their context and to the objects and purposes of the treaty.\"110\n\n1964 Report of the International Law Commission: Yearbook of the International Law Commission (1966), Vol.II at p. 95.\n\n5.2.6.\n\nArticle 31(1) envisages the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of a treaty in their context. Treaty terms are obviously not drafted in isolation, and their meaning can only be determined by considering the entire treaty text. The context will include the remaining terms of the sentence and of the paragraph; the entire article at issue; and the remainder of the treaty, *i.e.,* its text including its preamble and annexes and the other means mentioned in Articles 31(2) and 31(3).111\n\nMark E. Villiger, *\"Commentary on the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\"* (Martinus Nijhoss publishers, 2009), p. 427, \u00b6 10, Exh. RL-2.\n\n**6. ARTICLE VII.2 AS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO CONSENT TO ARBITRATE**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**6.1 Tribunal\u2019s Sources of Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------\n\n6.1.1.\n\nUnder ICSID, for an ICSID tribunal such as this to have jurisdiction, there must be a written agreement to arbitrate *(i.e.,* an agreement to submit a dispute to ICSID arbitration) between the host state and the foreign investor.\n\n6.1.2.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention provides, in pertinent part, that:\n\n\" *The jurisdiction o f the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute* *arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State,*  *which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre* *.\" (Tribunal\u2019 s emphasis)*\n\n6.1.3.\n\nArticle 25 confirms the basic principle, that recourse to ICSID arbitration rests on written consent. In this case, to the extent that such written agreement to arbitrate exists, it is made up of: (a) Respondent\u2019s written offer to arbitrate (which is found in the provisions of Article VII.2 of the BIT); and (b) Claimant\u2019s written acceptance of that offer (which is found in its Request dated 15 December 2009).112\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant explicitly stated that: \"Claimant in this case accepted the offer and the mechanism provided in the BIT by submitting our claim to this Tribunal. That provides the Tribunal with the necessary jurisdiction\" (\u00b6 7).\n\n6.1.4.\n\nThe relevant provisions of Article VII of the BIT, as set out in the authentic English version of the Treaty, provide that:\n\n*\"1.*  *Disputes* *between one of the Parties and one investor of the other Party, in connection with his investment,*  *shall be notified in writing,*  *including a [sic] detailed information,*  *by the investor* *to the recipient Party of the investment. As far as possible,*  *the investor and the concerned Party shall endeavour to settle these disputes* *by consultations and negotiations in good faith.*\n\n*2.*  *If these desputes [sic] cannot be settled* *in this way*  *within six months*  *following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1,*  *the dispute can be submitted,* *as the investor may choose, to:*\n\n*(a)*  *the International Center (sic) for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)* *...*\n\n*(b)...*\n\n*(c)...,*\n\n*provided that* *[if] the*  *investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party* *that is a party to the dispute*  *and a final award has not been rendered within one year* *.\" (Tribunal\u2019 s emphasis)*\n\n6.1.5.\n\nThe word \"if\u2019, which is found in the last paragraph of Article VII.2 in the text of the Treaty, quoted above, has been bracketed because of the Tribunal\u2019s 7 May 2012 Decision that, properly construed, the provisions of Article VII.2 are to be read as if it were not included.\n\n6.1.6.\n\nIt follows from the Tribunal\u2019s construction of Article VII.2 that the meaning and effect of that provision of the BIT is that a concerned investor (in this case, Claimant) is required to submit its dispute to the courts of the Contracting Party (in this case, Turkmenistan) with which a dispute has arisen. Further, the claimant must not have received a final award within one year from the date of submission of its case to the local courts, before it can institute arbitration proceedings in one of the three ways permitted by the Article.\n\n6.1.7.\n\nThe first question therefore is whether compliance by Claimant with the requirement for mandatory prior recourse to Respondent\u2019s courts is a precondition to ICSID arbitration and the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n**6.2 Conditional Offer to Arbitrate**\n--------------------------------------\n\n6.2.1.\n\nIt is a fundamental principle that an agreement is formed by offer and acceptance. But for an agreement to result, there must be acceptance of the offer *as made.* It follows that an arbitration agreement, such as would provide for the Centre to have jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, can only come into existence through a qualifying investor\u2019s acceptance of a host state\u2019s standing offer as made *(i.e.,* under its terms and conditions).\n\n6.2.2.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Professor Schreuer\u2019s view that the investor may accept or not accept the offer as it stands in the BIT, but it cannot alter it unilaterally:\n\n*\"where ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction is based on an offer made by one party, subsequently accepted by the other,*  *the party\u2019s consent is only to the extent that offer and acceptance coincide* *.... It is evident that the investor\u2019s acceptance may not validly go beyond the limits of the host State\u2019s offer. Therefore, any limitation contained in the legislation or treaty would apply irrespective of the terms of the investor\u2019s acceptance.* *If the terms of acceptance do not correspond with the terms of the offer there is no perfected consent.\"113 (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis)*\n\nChristoph Schreuer, *Consent to Arbitration,* UNCTAD Course On Dispute Settlement, International Centre For The Settlement Of Investment Disputes, Module 2.3, p. 30, Exh.

RL-19. *See also Republic of Ecuador v. Chevron Corporation, Texaco Petroleum Company* (US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 17 March, 2011), pp. 12-13 (\"... the BIT merely creates a framework through which foreign investors, such as Chevron, can initiate arbitration against parties to the Treaty. In the end, however, this proves to be a distinction without difference, since Ecuador, by signing the BIT, and Chevron, by consenting to arbitration, have created a separate binding agreement to arbitrate. [...] All that is necessary to form an agreement to arbitrate is for one party to be a BIT signatory and the other to consent to arbitration of an investment dispute in accordance with the Treaty\u2019s terms. In effect, Ecuador\u2019s accession to the Treaty constitutes a standing offer to arbitrate disputes covered by the Treaty; a foreign investor\u2019s written demand for arbitration completes the \"agreement in writing\" to submit the dispute to arbitration.\") (emphasis added) Exh.

A*  *Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent* *to arbitration under this Convention.\" (Tribunal\u2019 s emphasis)*\n\n6.2.5.\n\nAlthough this provision refers to the \"exhaustion\" of local remedies, the principle of imposing conditions to consent applies, *a fortiori,* to agreed provisions which require something other than full \"exhaustion of local or administrative remedies\" - namely to provisions requiring the prior submission of the dispute to the local courts for a specified period of time as a condition precedent to arbitration, but falling short of a requirement to exhaust local remedies.\n\n6.2.6.\n\nArticle VII of the BIT expressly articulates a multi-layered, sequential dispute resolution system providing for a sequence of separate dispute resolution procedures through which a dispute will escalate, if not resolved, in the former step. The Tribunal views the inclusion of such a multi-tiered system of dispute resolution in Article VII of the BIT to be in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n6.2.7.\n\nWhile the Contracting Parties in this case did not require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of their consent to ICSID arbitration, they did require that disputes between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the other Contracting Party:\n\n(a) be notified in writing, including detailed information, by the investor to the recipient Party of the investment;\n\n(b) that the investor and the concerned Contracting Party endeavour to settle these disputes by consultations and negotiations in good faith over a period of six months;\n\n(c) failing settlement, that the dispute be brought before the courts of justice of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute, and\n\n(d) that a final award not be rendered within one year.114\n\nSee BIT, Exhs. C-l and R-2, Article VII. 1-2.\n\n6.2.8.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of phrases such as \"shall be notified in writing...\" and \"shall endeavour to settle...\" points to a mandatory requirement. Similarly, where, as in the present case, a right to arbitrate is granted, \"provided that, [if] the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute, and a final award has not been rendered within one year,\"115 the exercise of such a right is conditional upon certain requirements having been met.\n\n*Id.,* Art. VII. 2\n\n6.2.9.\n\nThe adoption of language which requires that a series of steps *shall* be taken, and which provide for a right to arbitrate, *provided that* another step has been taken, is an obvious construction of a condition precedent.116 Indeed, a number of reputed dictionaries offer a definition of \"provided\" (followed by \"that\") to indicate a meaning of \"on the condition or understanding (that)\".117When such conditions are set out in the DRPs of a BIT *(as conditions of the Contracting Parties\u2019 offer to arbitrate),* which are the very source of an ICSID tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, compliance with them constitutes a jurisdictional requirement, in the sense that a failure to meet the conditions has the consequence that there exists no jurisdiction to be exercised.118\n\nMr Arthur Marriott QC, who appeared briefly as a member of Claimant\u2019s counsel team towards the end of the December 2012 hearing, argued, for the first time, that compliance with the prior recourse requirement was not a condition precedent to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, but a condition subsequent, compliance with which went only to the admissibility of Claimant\u2019s claims. The condition subsequent argument was not developed in Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief. Rather than referring to a \"condition subsequent\", Claimant there argued that there was an effective consent to arbitration by both parties. Claimant asserted that the resulting agreement by the parties to settle their dispute by arbitration was not conditioned \"to the occurrence of specific events or to fulfill specific requirements.\" The local litigation requirement was said to go only to the procedural admissibility of the claim, and not to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Claimant\u2019s admissibility arguments are dealt with at \u00b6 6.3 below.\n\n*See* the *Concise Oxford Dictionary, New Edition for the 1990s'.* \"Provided (followed by that): on the condition or understanding that\"; *The Free Dictionary.* \"Provided: on the condition or understanding that\"; *Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary:* \"Provided: on the condition that\"; *McMillan Dictionary.* \"Provided that: only if a particular thing is done\"; and *Oxford Dictionary.* \"Proviso: a condition or qualification attached to an agreement or a statement\".\n\nProfessor Park considers that Claimant\u2019s failure to comply with Article VII.2\u2019s local litigation proviso goes not to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, but only to the admissibility of Claimant\u2019s claims. His views are set out in his Separate Opinion which is appended to this Award.\n\n**6.3 Jurisdiction and Admissibility Distinguished**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n6.3.1.\n\nIn its initial written submissions on the single jurisdictional question, Claimant did not appear to dispute the conditionality of Respondent\u2019s offer to arbitrate. It contended that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over this dispute solely by virtue of the operation BIT\u2019s MFN provisions.\n\n6.3.2.\n\nHowever, during the course of the December 2012 hearing, counsel for Claimant invoked the *Abaclat* case to support an argument that compliance with Article VII.2 was an issue that went to the admissibility of a claim, rather than to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. The *Abaclat* tribunal held, by majority, that:\n\n*\"the negotiation and 18 months litigation requirement*  *relate to the conditions for implementation of Argentina\u2019s consent* *to ICSID jurisdiction and arbitration and*  *not the fundamental question of whether Argentina consented to ICSID jurisdiction* *and arbitration. Thus, any non-compliance with such requirements may not lead to a lack of ICSID jurisdiction, and only - if at all - to a lack of admissibility of the claim.\"119 (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis)*\n\n*Abaclat,* Exh. CL-32, \u00b6 496.\n\n6.3.3.\n\nClaimant thus maintained that if the Tribunal concluded that: (a) it could not base its jurisdiction on the operation of the BIT\u2019s MFN provision; and (b) Claimant was not exempted from compliance with Article VII.2 by reason of futility, the Tribunal should suspend the proceedings pending Claimant\u2019s compliance. This argument was premised on the grounds that jurisdiction existed but its exercise was inadmissible, as certain requirements had not been met.120\n\n*See* Transcript of 7 December 2012 hearing, pp. 79/4 - 83/21 and 172/22 - 173/6; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 3-9.\n\n6.3.4.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, to the extent that it was seeking to make a general proposition that went beyond the terms of the BIT at issue in that case, the majority in *Abaclat* fell into legal error. This is because Article 26 of the ICSID Convention explicitly recognises that a Contracting State may impose conditions on its consent to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, in a manner that determines the conditions in which jurisdiction may be said to exist and be capable of being exercised (without prejudice to any issue as to admissibility). This point was made with considerable force in the dissenting opinion of Professor Georges Abi-Saab in the *Abaclat* case, where he stated that the \"legal recharacterization\" of the majority was \"conceptually wrong\":\n\n*\"It adopts an extremely narrow, in fact partial, concept of jurisdiction, limiting it to the ambit within which jurisdiction is exercised. But, as explained above (para. 10 ff), jurisdiction is first and foremost a power, the legal power to exercise the judicial or arbitral function. Any limits to this power, whether inherent or consensual, i.e. stipulated in the jurisdictional title (consent within certain limits, or subject to reservations or conditions relating to the powers of the organ) are jurisdictional by essence.\"*\n\n6.3.5.\n\nAs the *Daimler* tribunal explained, the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility may be ill-suited to the context of treaty-based international jurisdiction:\n\n*\"In the domestic context,*  *admissibility requirements are judicially constructed rules designed to preserve the efficiency and integrity of court proceedings* *.*  *They do not expand [or provide the basis for] the jurisdiction of domestic courts* *. Rather, they serve to streamline courts\u2019 dockets by striking out matters which, though within the jurisdiction of the courts, are for one reason or another not appropriate for adjudication at the particular time or in the particular manner in question.*\n\n*All BIT-based dispute resolution provisions, on the other hand, are by their very nature jurisdictional. The mere fact of their inclusion in a bilateral treaty indicates that they are reflections of the sovereign agreement of two States - not the mere administrative creation of arbitrators. They set forth the conditions under which an investor-State tribunal may exercise jurisdiction with the contracting state parties\u2019 consent, much in the same way in which legislative acts confer* *jurisdiction upon domestic courts.\"121 (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis and added bracketed phase)*\n\n*Daimler,* Exh. RL-28, \u00b6\u00b6 192-3 (internal citation omitted).\n\n6.3.6.\n\nClaimant also sought to rely on the decision of the ICSID tribunal in the *Western NIS* case (comprised of Rodrigo Oreamuno, Michael Pryles and Jan Paulsson), which ordered the suspension of proceedings, the claimant there having failed to give to the respondent proper notice of the dispute in terms required by the BIT in question.122\n\n*See* Transcript of the 7 December 2012 hearing, p. 164/12 - 166/20 discussing *Western NIS Enterprise Fund v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/2, Order (March 16, 2006), ***(\"Western NIS\"),*** 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7 (\"Proper notice is an important element of the State's consent to arbitration, as it allows the State, acting through its competent organs, to examine and possibly resolve the dispute by negotiations. Proper notice of the present claim was not given. This conclusion does not, in and of itself, affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The Claimant should be given an opportunity to remedy the deficient notice. On the other hand, the proceedings should not be indefinitely suspended.\").\n\n6.3.7.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal, however, that that case was different and distinguishable. The *Western NIS* decision simply involved the failure of a claimant to give notice of its claim in terms required by the BIT. It did not concern a failure to comply with a requirement for any degree of prior recourse to local courts of the host state. Indeed, the BIT in question in *Western NIS* contained no such requirement.\n\n6.3.8.\n\nIn this regard, it is notable that Mr Paulsson, who was one of the arbitrators in *Western NIS,* has expressed the view that requirements of the kind arising in the present case go to the jurisdiction of a treaty tribunal and are not a matter of admissibility:\n\n*\"If an ephemeral arbitral tribunal is established under a treaty which contains requirements as to... their prior exhaustion of local remedies, the*  *claims a* *s such are perhaps subject to no impediment*  *but the forum seized is lacking one of the elements required to give it life in the first place* *.*  *For such a tribunal these are matters of jurisdiction* *.\"123 (Tribunal\u2019 s emphasis, except \"claims \" where emphasis is original)*\n\nJan Paulsson, *Jurisdiction and Admissibility,* in Global Reflections on International Law, Commerce and Dispute Resolution, Liber Amicorum in Honour of Robert Briner (ICC Publishing, 2005), p. 616, n. 47. Paulsson was comparing the broad consent given by state parties to ICJ jurisdiction with the narrower consent BIT state parties, such as here, often give to arbitral tribunals.\n\n6.3.9.\n\nAs noted above, Claimant\u2019s short submission made at the conclusion of the December 2012 hearing, that the requirement of prior recourse constituted a \"condition subsequent\", was not pursued as such in its Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n6.3.10.\n\nClaimant\u2019s subsequent contention, that the Contracting Parties\u2019 consent and offer to arbitrate, as made in Article VII of the BIT, was unconditional, appears to have been based on a proposition that a state\u2019s offer to resolve disputes by arbitration can be accepted by an investor of the other party \"even before a dispute arises, *let alone before any procedural steps anticipated in any BIT\u2019124* (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis). Thus, Claimant argued that \"Procedural conditions like notification, a negotiation period or recourse to local courts are *\"arbitral preconditions\"* which do not have an effect on the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.125 (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis)\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 4.\n\nId.,\u00b68.\n\n6.3.11.\n\nThe Tribunal identifies two fundamental difficulties with this argument, with regard to the facts of the present case.\n\n6.3.12.\n\nFirst, having regard to the language of Article VII as a whole, it is far easier to see it as containing a conditional offer to arbitrate (given the inclusion of the words \"shall\" and \"provided that\"), rather than an unconditional offer to arbitrate. In this regard, the conditions that inform that offer comprise five elements that must be met:\n\n(a) the dispute must have been notified in writing (Article VII. 1);\n\n(b) the investor and the concerned Party must, as far as possible, have endeavoured to settle the dispute by consultation and negotiations in good faith (Article VII. 1);\n\n(c) six months must have passed from the date of notification in writing (Article VII.2);\n\n(d) the investor must have brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute (Article VII.2); and\n\n(e) the courts of justice must not have rendered a final award within one year (Article VII.2).\n\n6.3.13.\n\nSecond, Claimant\u2019s argument ignores the fact that an ICSID tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is defined by the disputing parties\u2019 written consent/agreement and that, in this case, Respondent\u2019s consent/offer to arbitrate was conditioned, *inter alia,* on Claimant having previously brought the dispute before Respondent\u2019s courts and a final award not having been rendered within one year from the institution of the local court proceedings.\n\n6.3.14.\n\nThus, when it accepted Respondent\u2019s conditional offer to arbitrate disputes in connection with its investments before an ICSID Tribunal,126 in order for the necessary consent/agreement in writing to result, the offer must have been accepted on the basis of, and having regard to, the conditions explicitly set out in the BIT.\n\nInitially, Claimant took the position *(See* Request, \u00b6 100) that it agreed/gave its consent to ICSID arbitration when it gave notice of its dispute(s) in its letter of 26 March 2009. Subsequently, in its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant stated specifically that, \"in this case [it] accepted the offer and the mechanisms provided in the BIT by submitting [its] claim to this Tribunal (see Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b67). The relevant point, however, is not so much when Claimant accepted Respondent\u2019s offer, but that it could only accept the offer as made.\n\n6.3.15.\n\nFor these reasons, and on the basis of the factual record, the Tribunal concludes that the requirements set forth in Article VII.2 are to be treated as conditions, and that the failure to meet those conditions goes to the existence of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, and are not to be treated as issues of admissibility.\n\n**6.4 Suspension of Proceedings or Rejection of Claimant\u2019s Case**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.4.1.\n\nTurning to Claimant\u2019s alternative claim, that these proceedings be suspended, it is common ground that a tribunal that has no jurisdiction has no alternative but to decline to address the claim. Claimant makes the point in its Post-Hearing Brief that:\n\n\" *A tribunal having no jurisdiction cannot do anything but reject the claim because of a lack of jurisdiction**. However, a tribunal*  *may act differently* *in a situation*  *where,* *as in the present case,*  *an admissibility requirement has not yet been satisfied**. As noted above, arbitral tribunals who have treated this issue as a matter of admissibility have emphasized that non-compliance with the waiting requirement was a \u2018perfectible defect\u2019. Thus, a defect which is perfectible affords the* *arbitral tribunal the*  *discretion to suspend a hearing* *in order for a claimant to \u2018perfect\u2019 the dispute and make the claim admissible.\"*127\n\n*\"Tribunals possess far greater flexibility in dealing with admissibility requirements, where they consider that an admissibility requirement is contrary to good faith, or is futile and would not change the outcome, then*  *they would have discretion not to impose the admissibility requirement**.128 (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis)*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 19 (internal citations omitted).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 20.\n\n6.4.2.\n\nThe Claimant has therefore recognised that if the conditions set forth in Article VII.2 are to be treated as going to the existence of a jurisdictional basis, as is the case, it is not open to a Tribunal to suspend the proceedings. In short, the conditions for jurisdiction not having been met, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to suspend the proceedings. It follows that Claimant\u2019s alternative claim, that these proceedings be suspended, is not one that can be accepted.\n\n**6.5 Separate Opinion on Jurisdiction/Admissibility**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.5.1.\n\nIn his Separate Opinion, our colleague Professor Park concludes, like the majority, that the wording of Article VII. 1 imposes jurisdictional preconditions requiring notice of a dispute and an endeavour to settle by negotiation. He departs from the majority, however, in finding that Article VII.2\u2019s requirements for local litigation and \"no-judgment-within-a-year\" are not conditions precedent and go only to \"ripeness\" and the admissibility of the claim, as opposed to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n6.5.2.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal (the \"Majority\") has carefully considered these points, and exchanged views on these matters during the course of deliberations. Having considered each of the points raised in the Separate Opinion, the Majority is satisfied that it has adopted the correct conclusion, namely that the procedural steps set out in Article VII of the BIT constitute fundamental jurisdictional conditions to the Contracting Parties\u2019 offers to arbitrate disputes with investors of the other Party. The Majority is not persuaded that they are merely conditions for the implementation of a consent that has already been given.\n\n6.5.3.\n\nThe Majority has difficulty in identifying any qualitative aspect of the language of Article VII.2 that make its conditions inherently different from the conditions set out in Article VII. 1, in such a way as to point to a need to treat them differently. On its face, the text of Article VII as a whole indicates that, *a priori,* the five conditions it sets out should be treated in the same manner. There is no extrinsic evidence before the Tribunal that the Contracting Parties to the BIT, Turkey and Turkmenistan, intended the conditions set out in VII. 1, on the one hand, and those set out in VII.2, on the other, to be treated as being qualitatively different.\n\n6.5.4.\n\nProfessor Park suggests that construing the local litigation proviso as a condition to jurisdiction would defeat key purposes of the BIT because a swift *(i.e.,* in less than one year) but unfair judgment by a Contracting Party\u2019s domestic court would insulate a potentially discriminatory taking from arbitration. The Majority does not see why this should be the case. Just as a requirement to exhaust local remedies may be disregarded when it can be shown that no remedy is available, or an attempt at exhaustion would be futile, an ICSID tribunal that was presented with evidence that a respondent\u2019s domestic court had decided unfairly against a claimant investor, albeit within one year, could nevertheless exercise jurisdiction assuming that other conditions had been met. In other words, the mere fact that domestic proceedings had been initiated, and they had been unfairly concluded within a year, would not of itself be a bar to jurisdiction.\n\n**6.6 Preliminary Conclusion on Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n6.6.1.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, and subject to a finding of jurisdiction as the result of the operation of Article II.2, the Majority concludes that neither it, nor the Centre, has jurisdiction over this arbitration, due to the Claimant\u2019s failure to comply with the mandatory requirement of prior submission of the dispute to Turkmenistan\u2019s courts under Article VII.2 of the BIT. In the absence of jurisdiction, the Tribunal has no power to suspend these proceedings even if it was minded to do so.\n\n**7. DOES ARTICLE II.2\u2019S MFN \"TREATMENT\" ENCOMPASS ARTICLE VII.2\u2019S DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**7.1 The BIT\u2019s MFN Provisions**\n--------------------------------\n\n7.1.1.\n\nThe BIT\u2019s relevant MFN provision is found in Article II.2 and provides:\n\n*\"Each Party shall accord to these*  *investments,* *once established,*  *treatment no less favourable* *than that accorded in similar situations to investments of its investors or to investments of investors of any third country, whichever is the most favourable.\" (Tribunal\u2019 s emphasis)*\n\n7.1.2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s case for jurisdiction, based on the operation of the MFN clause, is that Article VII\u2019s DRPs constitute \"treatment\" for the purposes of Article II.2. Claimant says this is so because Article II is drafted \"in a broad manner\", and the Article VII\u2019s DRPs \"clearly falls within that \"treatment...\"129 Claimant\u2019s MFN arguments were notably lacking in an analysis of the text of Article II.2 in the context of the Treaty as a whole. Instead, reliance was placed on the conclusions of other tribunals that the word \"treatment\", referred to in the MFN clauses that they were concerned with, encompassed the DRPs of those treaties.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 8; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder \u00b6 47.\n\n7.1.3.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that whatever the merits (or otherwise) of the various authorities referred to by Claimant, they were concerned with different - and differently worded - provisions of other BITs. They cannot therefore be dispositive. The necessary starting point for an understanding of the meaning of the word \"treatment\" that is found in Article II.2, and of the scope of the application of the MFN clause, is necessarily premised on an understanding of context, and how that provision fits into the BIT as a whole.\n\n**7.2 The Structure of the BIT**\n--------------------------------\n\n7.2.1.\n\nThe BIT comprises a Preamble and nine Articles, each of which sets out particular terms of the Contracting Parties\u2019 agreement.\n\n7.2.2.\n\nThe Preamble describes the objects and purposes of the Treaty. Article I sets out a series of agreed definitions. Article II deals with the Promotion and Protection of Investment; Article III, with Expropriation/Compensation; Article IV, with Repatriation and Transfer; Article V, with Subrogation; and Article VI, deals with Delegation. Articles VII and VIII deal with the settlement of disputes: Article VII, with Settlement of Dispute Between One Party and Investors of the Other Party, and Article VIII, with Settlement of Disputes Between the Parties. Finally, Article IX, deals with Entering into Force.\n\n**7.3 Treaty Structure Distinguishes Rights from Remedies**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.3.1.\n\nA careful reading of the BIT indicates that the grant of *substantive rights* in relation to *investments* is established by the provisions of Articles II-VI, *whereas procedures (or modalities) for resolving disputes* in relation to the protection of those substantive rights are addressed in Article VII (and, in relation to disputes between the Contracting Parties in Article VIII).\n\n7.3.2.\n\nArticle II grants two MFN rights. The first MFN right, in Article II. 1, requires the Contracting Parties to *permit investments,* and associated activities, to be made or carried out in their territories, on a basis that is no less favourable than that accorded to investments of investors of any third country. The second MFN right, in Article II.2, requires each Contracting Party to *accord to these investments,* once established, *treatment no less favourable* than that accorded to its own investors, or to the investors of any third country.\n\n7.3.3.\n\nIn addition to creating MFN rights, Article II grants *rights of entry* to nationals of either Party, for the purposes of establishing investments, and *rights to engage managerial and technical personnel of their choice* in relation to relevant investments (Article II.3).\n\n7.3.4.\n\nArticle III. 1 grants *rights* of *protection against expropriation.* Article III.2 sets out *compensation rights* in relation to expropriation, and Article III.3 provides for *MFN treatment of investors whose investments suffer losses* in the territory of the other Contracting Party *owing to war, insurrections, civil disturbances* or other similar events.\n\n7.3.5.\n\nArticle IV. 1 requires each Contracting Party to *permit the free transfer of funds, related to investments,* in and out of its territory.\n\n7.3.6.\n\nArticle V provides for the *recognition* by a Contracting Party of *an insurer\u2019s right of subjugation in relation to an investment* made by an investor of another Party.\n\n7.3.7.\n\nArticle VI provides that the *BIT shall not derogate from the obligations* of either of the Contracting Parties *found in other laws or instruments* \"that entitle investments or associated activities to treatment more favourable than that accorded by this Agreement in like situations.\"\n\n7.3.8.\n\nArticles VII and VIII, by contrast, are basically dispute settlement clauses. They set out the available procedures for the resolution of disputes between investors and the Contracting Parties, and between the Contracting Parties themselves. The dispute settlement clauses record:\n\n(a) in the case of Article VII, the Contracting Parties\u2019 conditioned offer to arbitrate investment disputes (arising out of alleged breaches of rights created under Articles II-VI); and\n\n(b) in the case of Article VIII, the Contracting Parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate disputes as between themselves concerning the interpretation and application of the BIT.\n\n7.3.9.\n\nThe text of the Treaty indicates that its drafters recognised a distinction between *substantive rights* in relation to investments, and *remedial procedures* in relation to those rights. The substantive rights in relation to *investments* are found in Articles II-VI of the Treaty, and the procedures for the resolution of *disputes* in relation to those rights are set out in Article VII. This distinction suggests strongly that the \"treatment\" of \"investments\" for which MFN rights were granted was intended to refer only to the scope of the *substantive rights* identified and adopted in Articles II-VI.\n\n**7.4 Principle of Effectiveness Invalidates Claimant\u2019s Interpretation of Scope of MFN Clause**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.4.1.\n\nThe textually and contextually suggested limitation to the scope of application of Article II.2\u2019s MFN treatment of investments to the *substantive rights* provided in Articles II-VI is confirmed by the circumstances prevailing at the time of the conclusion of the BIT *(i.e.,* when it was negotiated and adopted on 2 May 1992).\n\n7.4.2.\n\nAt that time, Turkey had already agreed 22 BITs with other countries. A number of these contained no requirement for the prior submission of investment disputes to the local courts of the host state, unlike the present BIT.\n\n7.4.3.\n\nThat being the case, the Tribunal notes Respondent\u2019s contention that if Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article II.2 were to be accepted as correct, Article VII.2\u2019s carefully crafted jurisdictional preconditions of the Contracting Parties\u2019 offer to arbitrate disputes would have been without any effect from the moment this BIT was adopted This is because any Turkmen investor in Turkey could have disregarded the BIT\u2019s prior recourse requirement from the moment the BIT entered into force.\n\n7.4.4.\n\nAccordingly, the established international law principle, that treaties must be interpreted in the light of the principle of effectiveness of all their provisions, stands against Claimant\u2019s interpretation of the scope of Article II.2.130\n\nMalgosia Fitzmaurice & Panos Merkouris, *Canons of Treaty Interpretation: Selected Case Studies From The World Trade Organization and The North American Free Trade Agreement* in TREATY INTERPRETATION AND The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties; *30*  *years on,* Martinus Nijhoff (2010) Publishers, pp. 179 -83.\n\n**7.5 Claimant\u2019s Case Leads to Non-Reciprocal Obligations**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.5.1.\n\nOf equal relevance is the fact that, if Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article II.2 were to be accepted, the prior recourse requirement of Article VII.2 would not have been reciprocal, *ab initio.* This is because Turkish investors in Turkmenistan would have been bound to submit their disputes to the Turkmen local courts before initiating arbitration in the absence of any other Turkmenistan BIT\u2019s not requiring recourse to local courts, while Turkmen investors in Turkey would not first be required to submit their disputes to the Turkish courts.\n\n7.5.2.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that it is not immediately apparent why the Contracting Parties to this BIT would have consciously decided to enter into nonreciprocal obligations in relation to so central an element of the BIT.\n\n7.5.3.\n\nThese further points confirm the Tribunal\u2019s view that, at the time of the signature of the BIT, Turkey and Turkmenistan did not intend that Article VII.2\u2019s mandatory requirement for prior submission of any dispute to the local courts of the host State should be over-ridden by the operation of Article II.2 MFN clause.\n\n**7.6 The Decisions of Other Tribunals are to be Distinguished**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.6.1.\n\nEach party drew attention to the decisions of other ICSID and investor-state tribunals in which claimants sought to use the relevant treaty\u2019s MFN clause to \"borrow\" dispute resolution provisions from another treaty which did not contain the precondition to arbitration that the claimant in question was alleged to have ignored.131\n\nAt the date of this Award, the Tribunal is aware of 22 such decisions: 11 favour Claimant\u2019s position; 11 favour Respondent\u2019s.\n\n7.6.2.\n\nThese decisions are not binding authority, and none can be regarded as dispositive for this Tribunal. It is required to make its determination based on the interpretation of the BIT, the factual record before it, and the arguments advanced by the parties.\n\n7.6.3.\n\nNevertheless, the disputing parties were entitled to adopt, as part of their arguments, the legal reasoning of other tribunals as part of their cases. For this reason, the Tribunal deals below with the cases relied on by Claimant.\n\n***No Scope for Presumptions***\n-------------------------------\n\n7.6.4.\n\nThe Tribunal does not intend, in this Award, to enter into a general doctrinal debate about whether BIT DRPs should (or should not) be *presumed* to fall within the scope of MFN clauses.\n\n7.6.5.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the VCLT which concern the interpretation of treaties do not indicate that there is to be a *presumption* one way or the other as to the reach of an MFN clause. That depends on the ordinary meaning of the words used in their context and having regard to the objects and purposes of the relevant treaty. Thus, the Tribunal will not address further Claimant\u2019s contention that, *unless excluded* from the scope of the MFN clause, a treaty\u2019s DRPs should be *presumed* to be encompassed by it, because of the breadth of the definition of \"treatment\".\n\n***Cases Relied on by Claimant***\n---------------------------------\n\n7.6.6.\n\nClaimant relied on the ten cases in which tribunals concluded that the MFN clauses in question were referable to the DRPs of the particular treaty under review. These (and their relevant BITs) were: *Maffezini* (Arg.-Spain BIT), *Suez-InterAguas* (Arg.-Spain BIT), *Siemens* (Arg.-Germany BIT), *Gas Natural* (Arg.-Spain BIT), *Telefonica* (Arg.-Spain BIT), *National Grid* (Arg.-UK BIT), *Suez-AWG* (Arg.-Spain BIT), *RosInvest* (UK-Russia BIT), *Impregilo* (Arg.-Italy BIT), and *Hochtief* (Arg.-Germany BIT).\n\n7.6.7.\n\nThe Tribunal was not referred to the recent decision on jurisdiction by the ICSID tribunal in the *Teinver* case, which was issued on 21 December 2012.132 The *Teinver* tribunal concluded that *Teinver* could rely on the Article IV.2 MFN clause in the Argentina-Spain BIT to make use of the dispute resolution provisions contained in Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT. Had this decision been issued prior to the December 2012 hearing, Claimant would presumably have relied upon it. Even though it does not bear on the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion on this point, it will be dealt with here for the sake of completeness.133\n\n*Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on jurisdiction (21 December 2012) **(\"Teinver\").**\n\nBecause it has had no bearing whatever on the outcome, the Tribunal did not request the parties to comment on the decision for the purposes of this Award.\n\n7.6.8.\n\nThe 11 decisions are discussed below in groupings based on the BITs they deal with. Before turning to the details, the fundamental point to be made regarding each of the BITs which were the subject of these decisions is that the wording of the relevant MFN clause is much broader than that found in the BIT here in issue.\n\n7.6.9.\n\nThe *Argentina-Spain BIT Provisions:* Six of the 11 cases dealt with Article 4(2) of the Argentina-Spain BIT. While the unofficial translation used in the six decisions varied slightly from case to case, it is apparent that Article 4(2) contains wording to the effect that: *\"in all matters subject to this agreement,* this treatment shall not be less favourable than that extended by each Party to the investments made in its territory by investors of a third country\" (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis); or, *\"in all matters governed by the present Agreement,* such treatment shall not be less favourable than that accorded by each Party to investments made in its territory by investors of Third States.\" (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis) Based on the plain meaning of such wording, the Tribunal can understand a decision that Article 4(2)\u2019s MFN provisions encompass the BIT\u2019s DRPs is apparently supported by the text (but expresses no view on whether it, faced with the same language, would have reached the same conclusion).\n\n7.6.10.\n\nThe *Argentina-Germany BIT Provisions'.* The relevant wording of the Argentina-Germany BIT, which was considered in two of the 11 cases - *Siemens* and *Hochtief -* was also considerably broader than that of Article II.2 of the BIT.\n\n7.6.11.\n\nThe unofficial translation used by the *Siemens* tribunal provides that:\n\n*\"3(1) neither Contracting Party shall subject investments in its territory by or with the participation of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than its accords to investments of its own nationals or companies or to investments of nationals or companies by any third State.*\n\n*(2) neither Contracting Party shall*  *subject nationals* *or*  *companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their activity in connection with investments* *in its territory,*  *to treatment less favourable* *than it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State \". (Tribunals\u2019 emphasis)*\n\n7.6.12.\n\nThe Argentina-Germany BIT also includes an important \"Ad Article 3\" which provides, in pertinent part, that:\n\n*\"(a) The*  *following shall,* *more particularly, but no exclusively,*  *be deemed \"activity* *\" within the meaning of Article 3, paragraph 2:*  *the management, utilization, use and enjoyment of an investment* *...\"*\n\n*(Tribunal\u2019 s emphasis)*\n\n7.6.13.\n\nAlthough the language of the Argentina-Germany BIT is not as broad as that of the Argentina-Spain BIT, the guarantee of most favoured nation \"treatment\" to *investors\u2019 activities which extends to the management of their investments* appears on its face to be broader in scope than Article II.2. The resolution of disputes relating to investments is an everyday aspect of an investor\u2019s management of it investments. That being the case, the Tribunal understands why the DRPs of the Argentina-Germany BIT might reasonably be seen to fall within the scope of the treaty\u2019s MFN clause (but again expresses no view on whether it, faced with the same language, would have reached the same conclusion).\n\n7.6.14.\n\n*The Argentina-UK* and the *UK-Russia BIT Provisions:* The Argentina-UK BIT, which was considered by the *National Grid* tribunal, and the UK-Russia BIT, which was considered by the *RosInvest* tribunal, each contain identical language, which is of similar scope to the Argentina-Germany BIT. In both, Article 3(2) provides that:\n\n\" *Neither Contracting Party shall* *in its territory*  *subject investors* *of the other Contracting Party,*  *as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatments less favourable* *than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State. The extension of MFN rights to provisions relating to management, maintenance and use of investments.\" (Tribunal\u2019 s emphasis)*\n\nAgain, on its face the text seems broad enough to encompass the two treaties\u2019 dispute resolution provisions (but again this Tribunal expresses no view on whether it, faced with the same language, would have reached the same conclusion).\n\n7.6.15.\n\n*The Argentina-Italy BIT Provisions:* Finally, Article 3 of the Argentina-Italy BIT, considered by the *Impregilo* tribunal, is of similar breadth to that found in the Argentina-Spain BIT. Article 3.1 provide that:\n\n*\"each*  *Contracting Party shall,* *within its own territory,*  *accord to investments* *made by investors of the other Contracting Party, to the income and activities related to such investments,*  *and to all other matters regulated by this agreement,* *a*  *treatment that is no less favourable* *than that accorded to its own investors or investors from third-party countries.\" (Tribunal\u2019 s emphasis)*\n\n7.6.16.\n\nSuch wording is, in the words of the *Teinver* tribunal, \"unambiguously inclusive\", and can be seen to support the conclusion by that tribunal that it encompassed the regulation of dispute resolution by the DRP\u2019s contained in the treaty (but again the Tribunal expresses no view on whether it, faced with the same language, would have reached the same conclusion).\n\n7.6.17.\n\nHaving regard to the textually broader scope of the MFN clauses in each of these cases, compared with that of Article II.2, the Tribunal finds the legal reasoning set out in these decisions to be inapplicable to an understanding and interpretation of the wording of the BIT.\n\n**7.7 The Principle of** ***Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.7.1.\n\nClaimant argues that the inclusion of Article VII\u2019s DRPs within the scope of Article II.2\u2019s MFN provisions is confirmed by a straightforward application of the principle of *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* to the \"explicit exclusions\" listed in Article II.4.\n\n7.7.2.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this view is not correct, for several reasons.\n\n7.7.3.\n\nFirst, in relation to exclusions, the operation of the *expressio unius...* maxim, means that if a treaty provision expressly excludes the application of a treaty term (here Article II.2) to one thing *(e.g,* the articles of another identified treaty), then other things *in the same class* of whatever was excluded *(e.g,* the articles of other treaties which were not identified) are, logically to be included in the application of the treaty term.\n\n7.7.4.\n\nThus, for Article VII to have been encompassed in the scope of Article II.2 by reason of an exclusion found in Article II.4, the exclusion might have been expected to be formulated in terms such as \"[t]he provisions of this Article shall not apply in relation to the provisions of Articles VI and VIII of this Treaty.\"\n\n7.7.5.\n\nHad it done so, it might logically have been concluded that the provisions of Article II were intended by the Contracting Parties to include *(i.e.,* to apply to) the non-excluded Articles of the Treaty.\n\n7.7.6.\n\nThe difficulty for Claimant here is that Article II.4 did not use such a formulation. Rather, on its most favourable interpretation for Claimant, it excluded the application of Article Il\u2019s MFN provisions to the treatment of an investor\u2019s investments found in certain *other treaties or agreements.*\n\n7.7.7.\n\nThe fact that the Contracting Parties chose to limit the application of Article Il\u2019s MFN rights in relation to certain other treaties/agreements, which may have treated qualifying investments more favourable than they are treated in the BIT, would not appear to have any relevance for the question of whether the DRPs found in Article VII.2 can properly be interpreted as the \"treatment of investments\" and therefore as coming within the scope of Article II.2.\n\n**7.8 The Parties\u2019 Subsequent Specific Inclusions and Exclusions of DRPs from MFN Clauses in Other BITs**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.8.1.\n\nClaimant relies on Turkey\u2019s BIT with Azerbaijan (in which the contracting parties specifically *excluded* the application of that treaty\u2019s MFN provision to its DRPs) to show that it was the *practice* of Turkey \"to indicate expressly in case it intends to exclude the DRP from the scope of the MFN clause.\"134 However, the BIT in question makes no such showing.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 107.\n\n7.8.2.\n\nMoreover, a single treaty, concluded approximately twenty years after the execution of the BIT here in issue, and three years after the commencement of this arbitration, cannot qualify as an example of the generality of Turkey\u2019s *practice* in 2012, or indicate a basis for concluding that an alternative approach taken in 2012 should be relied upon to conclude that Turkey intended a different approach in 1992.\n\n7.8.3.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it to be unlikely that either party turned its mind explicitly - in 1992 - to the question of whether the MFN clause encompassed DRPs. Indeed, having regard to the state of international law at the time, and the absence of judicial or arbitral authority for the proposition that an MFN clause could ever cover a DRP, the better view is that the Contracting Parties proceeded on the basis that that MFN clauses did *not* encompass a DRP.\n\n7.8.4.\n\nSince 1992 arbitral practice has changed, initiated by the award *in Maffezini,* which has been followed in some subsequent cases but also criticised in others, and in academic and other authorities. Since the *Maffezini* decision, states have, on occasion, adopted a new practice, and this appears to be what Turkey did in 2012.\n\n7.8.5.\n\nClaimant also points to other treaties such as Turkey-UK BIT and the Turkmenistan-UK BIT to prove that these contracting \"parties always considered the DRP are covered by MFN treatment\". The Turkmenistan-UK BIT is said to provide in its relevant MFN clauses that:\n\n*\"... the treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above*  *shall apply* *to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement (including DRP of Article VIII).\"135 (Claimant\u2019s emphasis)*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 108.\n\n7.8.6.\n\nSuch an argument on the part of the Claimant is not persuasive.\n\n7.8.7.\n\nFirst, neither of the BITs identified by Claimant includes a clause such as set out or described in paragraph 108 of Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\n7.8.8.\n\nSecond, even if Turkey or Turkmenistan had included such a clause in a BIT with another Contracting Party, to the extent that this would establish anything, it would be no more than that Turkey and Turkmenistan (and their respective Contracting Parties) went out of their way in those BITs to express the view that they wanted the relevant MFN provisions to encompass and apply to the DRPs of those BITs.\n\n7.8.9.\n\nThus, rather than supporting Claimant\u2019s case, any such wording of the MFN clauses in such BITs would tend to confirm that Article II.2\u2019s MFN provisions were not intended to apply to Article VII.2\u2019s DRPs.\n\n7.8.10.\n\nThis is consistent too with the view expressed by Professor Zachary Douglas, namely that an MFN clause in a basic investment treaty \"does not incorporate by reference provisions relating to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, in whole or in part, set forth in a third investment treaty, unless there is an unequivocal provision to that effect in the basic investment treaty.\"136\n\nZachary Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims,* Cambridge University Press (2009), Rule 43, pp. 344 *et seq.*\n\n**7.9 Conclusion on the Scope of the MFN Clause**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n7.9.1.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal concludes that Article II.2\u2019s MFN provision does not encompass or apply to the BIT\u2019s DRPs so as to permit Claimant to rely on the DRP\u2019s of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT. This, therefore, confirms its conclusion above, that neither it, nor the Centre has jurisdiction over this arbitration, unless Claimant is excused from mandatory prior recourse to Respondent\u2019s courts by reason of its futility argument.\n\n**8. IS CLAIMANT EXCUSED FROM PRIOR MANDATORY RECOURSE TO RESPONDENT\u2019S COURTS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**8.1 Would Mandatory Recourse have been Futile**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n8.1.1.\n\nThe Claimant argues that it is exempted from compliance with the provisions of Article VII.2, because prior recourse to Respondent\u2019s courts would have been ineffective and futile. The argument is based by analogy on the principle that the international law requirement to exhaust local remedies may be disregarded when, in reality, no remedy is available or any attempt at exhaustion would be futile.\n\n8.1.2.\n\nIt is true that Claimant\u2019s counsel took the position, *by way of submissions,* that Claimant: (a) was unable to find a single Turkmen lawyer who was willing to testify against Respondent; and (b) communicated with other investors with claims against Respondent and understands that its experience is universal.\n\n8.1.3.\n\nBut, this is not compelling \"evidence\" of futility, if indeed it can be said to constitute evidence at all in support of the proposition on which Claimant relies. Moreover, the submission is not on point.\n\n8.1.4.\n\nA tribunal cannot properly come to a conclusion that an investor is not required to comply with mandatory prior recourse to a state\u2019s courts unless a clear case has been made out, based on sufficient and \"best\" evidence, that recourse is not available to the state\u2019s court or, if available, the investor would not have been treated fairly before those courts.\n\n8.1.5.\n\nClaimant has tendered no evidence - whether in the form of a witness or expertise -to support its assertion. Nor has Claimant sought to offer any explanation or account as to its failure to tender such evidence.\n\n8.1.6.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that - irrespective of whether Turkmen lawyers were or were not unwilling to testify \"against the Government of Turkmenistan\" because of \"a fear for the security of the person and family of the Turkmen lawyer from reprisals by the Government of the Respondent\"137 - the point does not go to the issue that falls to be addressed, namely:\n\n(a) whether, under Turkmen law, recourse to the Turkmen courts was available in principle to Turkish investors at the relevant time in relation to disputes arising under the BIT; and\n\n(b) if available in principle, whether an attempt to exercise the right of recourse would have been futile or ineffective because of particular failings in/of Respondent\u2019s courts/judiciary/administration of justice.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 48.\n\n8.1.7.\n\nAs Respondent points out, the \"futility\" test relied upon by Claimant was inspired by international jurisprudence dealing with the international law rule of exhaustion of local remedies. However, Article VII.2 of the BIT does not require the exhaustion of local remedies as the concept is understood under international law. It simply requires an investor with a dispute to take the matter to the host state\u2019s courts and not to have received a final award within one year.\n\n8.1.8.\n\nHere, despite its obligation to do so, Claimant has elected not to submit its dispute to the competent local courts in Turkmenistan prior to turning to ICSID arbitration. It has apparently not taken a single procedural step there prior to submitting this dispute to ICSID. Nor has Claimant offered any explanation as to what, if anything, it did to investigate prior recourse to Respondent\u2019s courts before it initiated these proceedings, or to conclude that it had no need to provide any account as to why it had not had recourse to the local courts.\n\n8.1.9.\n\nClaimant\u2019s failure to lead sufficient evidence on these points is all but fatal having regard to the onus it bears to show that prior recourse would have been ineffective or futile.\n\n8.1.10.\n\nClaimant\u2019s futility analysis is based principally on broad statements and third party studies/reports, to the effect that the Turkmen judiciary lacks independence, and that the Turkmen authorities would have had a particular aversion to Turkish investors. The Tribunal considers, however, that if a party to proceedings such as these is to make a futility argument, it has the onus of showing that recourse to the Contracting State\u2019s courts would be futile or ineffective, and that requires the tendering of probative evidence that goes to the specificity of the issue in dispute. It is not enough to make generalised allegations about the insufficiency of a state\u2019s legal system. Against the backdrop of relevant Turkmen laws introduced into the record by Respondent, such material as has been relied upon by Claimant cannot constitute sufficient evidence of unavailability or ineffectiveness.\n\n8.1.11.\n\nRespondent points to the 2008 Turkmen Constitution, which sets forth the principle of independence of judges, guarantees their immunity and prohibits any interference in their work. It also provides that justice is to be dispensed on the basis of equality and due process. Cases are heard by full benches, trials are public and the right to legal assistance is recognised at all stages of the proceedings.\n\n8.1.12.\n\nSimilarly, the 2009 Law on Courts **(\"Law on Courts\")** sets out the principle of independence of judges and prohibits any interference in their work, under criminal and administrative penalty.138 The Law on Courts also excludes accountability of a judge before state authorities, and other entities, with regard to the cases that he or she handles. The same law also provides guarantees of fair trial and due process.\n\n*See* Law on Courts of Turkmenistan (15 August 2009), Excerpts, Exh. RL-40.\n\n8.1.13.\n\nRespondent also refers to the legal text governing proceedings before the Arbitrazh Court of Turkmenistan, which indicates that it is the competent Turkmen court to hear Claimant\u2019s BIT disputes.\n\n8.1.14.\n\nClaimant does not dispute that the Arbitrazh Court has jurisdiction to hear disputes arising out of international treaties of Turkmenistan. It simply says that it was unable to verify the effect of the Law on Courts.139 Moreover, Claimant does not contest that the Arbitrazh Procedural Code **(\"APC\")** provides strict timeframes for the court to resolve disputes. The APC also has similar provisions to those found in the Law of Courts and the 2008 Constitution, regarding guarantees of independence of judges and fair trials in Arbitrazh proceedings.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 148; *see* Arbitrazh Procedural Code of Turkmenistan, Excerpts, Exh. RL-39.\n\n8.1.15.\n\nClaimant says that \"the recent improvement of judiciary has not been substantiated by the Respondent.\" It is true that Respondent has not lead evidence of a track record of proceedings before the Arbitrazh Court involving investment disputes brought against Respondent. Although this is explained on the basis that there have been none, the more important point is that the onus is not on Respondent to prove the availability and efficacy of its court systems to manage investor related disputes. Rather, the onus is on Claimant to show, on sufficient evidence, that such recourse is unavailable or would be futile *in respect of the matters at issue in this case,* including in relation to this party and to the matters in dispute.\n\n8.1.16.\n\nClaimant\u2019s only testamentary evidence which was seemingly intended to address this point, is found in two witness statements of Mr Osman Arslan. However, to the Tribunal\u2019s mind, Mr Arslan\u2019s evidence was not directed to the availability and efficacy of the Turkmen judicial system to handle investor-state disputes.\n\n8.1.17.\n\nIt is not in issue that the proceedings against Mr Arslan, and which are the subject of his testimony, arose out of the collapse of scaffolding at Claimant\u2019s Mary City mosque project. Nor is it contested that the collapse resulted in severe injury to a number of workers and the death of one worker. It is also by no means clear that the proceedings against Mr Arslan were improper, that he was ill-treated or that he was denied due process. But even assuming some deficiencies, Mr Arslan\u2019s evidence of what happened in these proceedings does not touch on the availability or efficacy of a dispute between an investor and the state in proceedings before the Arbitrazh Court.\n\n8.1.18.\n\nSimilarly, Claimant\u2019s reliance on Mr Bozbey\u2019s claim before the UN Human Rights Committee, based on allegations that he was subjected to arbitrary arrest, improper detention and discrimination, is not on point (assuming it even to be compelling).\n\n8.1.19.\n\nAlthough of Turkish nationality, there is no suggestion that Mr Bozbey has any relationship with Kili\u00e7. It is thus difficult to see how his complaints about the criminal proceedings that were brought against him, even if justified, are relevant to Kili\u00e7\u2019s complaints about the unavailability of or futility in having recourse to Respondent\u2019s courts over its BIT claims.\n\n8.1.20.\n\nMoreover, Claimant\u2019s arguments, which are based on his complaints, are not assisted by the UN Human Rights Committee\u2019s finding that they had not been substantiated. The Committee also noted that Mr Bozbey had been convicted in accordance with domestic legislation of Turkmenistan and did not condemn or otherwise criticise his criminal conviction.\n\n8.1.21.\n\nIn these circumstances, based on the evidentiary record, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that it would have been ineffective or futile for Claimant to have sought to comply with Article VII.2\u2019s requirement for prior recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan. Accordingly, Claimant was not exempted from their application.\n\n**9. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**9.1 Parties\u2019 Claims for Costs**\n---------------------------------\n\n9.1.1.\n\nAt the close of the 7 December 2012 hearing, the parties were requested to provide the Tribunal \"... with [their] cost claims, assuming [they] are both claiming costs in the event of success..,\"140\n\nTranscript of 7 December 2012 hearing, p. 192/20-25.\n\n9.1.2.\n\nOn 8 January 2013, in response to the Tribunal\u2019s request, each of the parties submitted statements of costs, as requested.\n\n9.1.3.\n\nClaimant sought an award of cost in the amount of US $1,788,386, based upon:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cost Item** | **Amount US $** |\n| Volterra Fietta Services (Fees and Costs) | 535,790 |\n| \u00c7etinel Services | 701,860 |\n| Other Lawyers (Mr Fatih Serbest, Mr Niyazi Seyhan and Ms Mahnaz Malik) | 288,074 |\n| Legal Opinion Costs | 5,000 |\n| Miscellaneous Expenses | 32,662 |\n| ICSID Fees | 225,000 |\n| **Total** | **1,788,386** |\n\n9.1.4.\n\nRespondent sought an award of costs in the amount of US $4,227,583, based upon:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cost Item** | **Amount US $** |\n| Legal fees - Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP and G\u00fcrel Y\u00f4r\u00fcker Law Offices | 3,837,977 |\n| Disbursements (including $225,000 payments to ICSID and Respondent\u2019s experts) | 389,606 |\n| **Total** | **4,227,583** |\n\n9.1.5.\n\nOn 18 January 2013, as invited, Claimant submitted comments on Respondent\u2019s claim for costs.\n\n9.1.6.\n\nClaimant took the position that:\n\n(a) Respondent had failed to provide any detailed information on its claimed expenses or a breakdown of its fee claims, which were said to be excessive in nature;\n\n(b) Respondent should provide a detailed breakdown of the fees and information on the expenses incurred in order to enable it to review them, and comment and/or object; and, in any event;\n\n(c) Respondent\u2019s costs were not incurred due to the acts of Claimant.\n\n9.1.7.\n\nRespondent had no comment to make on Claimant\u2019s cost submission, save to maintain that costs should be awarded to it.\n\n**9.2 Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Costs**\n------------------------------------\n\n9.2.1.\n\nICSID Convention Article 61(2) requires a tribunal, except as the parties otherwise agree, to assess the expenses incurred by the parties in conjunction with the proceedings, and to decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision is required to form part of any award.\n\n9.2.2.\n\nRule 28 (2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which governs the costs of proceedings, provides that:\n\n*\"Promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts paid by each party to the Centre and of all costs incurred by the Centre for the proceeding. The Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, request the Parties and the* *Secretary-General to provide additional information concerning the costs of the proceeding.\"*\n\n9.2.3.\n\nThe Secretary of the Tribunal has advised the Tribunal that the costs of the arbitration, which include, *inter alia,* the arbitrators\u2019 fees, the expenses of the Tribunal, the Secretariat\u2019s administrative fees and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, at the time of the Award, amount to US $618,176.40.141\n\nThe total costs of the proceeding as provided herein are actual as of the day of dispatch of the Award. It does not include the courier services expenses to be incurred for sending the certified copies of the Award as well as the printing and binding costs. Therefore, these costs will be subject to a slight variation. Upon the financial closure of the case, ICSID will provide a final financial statement reflecting the final costs. Such statement will be notified to the Parties within 90 days from the date of dispatch of the Award.\n\n9.2.4.\n\nIn this case, each of the parties has asked the Tribunal to exercise discretion in its favour under Article 61.\n\n9.2.5.\n\nArticle 61(2) provides the Tribunal with a wide discretion on how the costs of an arbitration should be borne. For the reasons discussed below, the Majority concludes that Claimant should bear its own costs together with 50% of Respondent\u2019s reasonable costs, in relation to the second phase of these proceedings as set out in paragraph 9.2.9 below.\n\n9.2.6.\n\nClaimant asserted far-reaching claims in these proceedings which it must have expected Respondent to take seriously and to defend accordingly. The Tribunal accepts that the meaning and effect *(i.e.,* the optionality) of Article VII.2 was an unsettled question at the time Claimant filed its Request, and that the meaning and effect of that requirement was most certainly not clear. Nevertheless, it appears that Claimant seems to have disregarded entirely the possibility that Article VII.2 might require it to refer its claims to the Turkmen courts prior to initiating ICSID arbitration proceedings. After the meaning of Article VII.2 had been decided by the Tribunal, Claimant offered no explanation for its decision not to seek to comply with the provisions of Article VII.2. Nor, on the evidence, would it appear that Claimant gave any consideration to compliance with Article VII.2\u2019s prior recourse requirements before it filed its Request. Indeed, it is not evident from the Request that Claimant even complied fully with Article VII.2\u2019s notice of dispute requirements in respect of all aspects of the dispute that was submitted to the Tribunal, or that it sought their settlement \"by consultations and negotiations\" as required by the clear language of Article VII.2.\n\n9.2.7.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Majority considers that it would be unreasonable to direct that each party should be required to bear all of its own costs of the proceedings to date. Claimant exercised a right to bring these proceedings, but it did so on the basis of an expectation that there would be potentially serious challenges to jurisdiction or admissibility. The Majority considers that Claimant should accordingly bear some of the consequences of its actions by reimbursing Respondent for 50% of the reasonable costs it incurred in responding to Claimant\u2019s case leading to the dismissal of these proceedings for want of jurisdiction. As regards an assessment of the reasonableness of Respondent\u2019s costs, Respondent has provided a statement of the totality of the time spent by its legal team (13,415 hours), together with a short-form list of tasks on which that time was spent. This limited description of how Respondent\u2019s costs were incurred is not sufficient to enable the Tribunal to assess which costs were expended in relation to different phases of the case, whether all of its costs are reasonable and were reasonably incurred. This can come as no surprise to Respondent as, at the conclusion of the December 2012 hearing, the parties were directed to provide sufficient detail for the Tribunal to consider whether their costs were reasonably incurred.142\n\nTranscript of 7 December 2012 hearing, p. 192/21-25.\n\n9.2.8.\n\nHowever, the Majority considers that an expenditure of 13,415 hours is very extensive by any reasonable standard, having regard to the relatively limited and discrete issues briefed and addressed in the totality of these proceedings to date.\n\n9.2.9.\n\nBased on the information available to it, including Claimant\u2019s claim for costs, and having regard to the nature of the written and oral submissions to date, and the need for only two separate days of oral hearings (one for each phase of the case), the Majority determines that Respondent\u2019s legal cost and disbursement143 in an amount of US $2,001,291.50 are reasonably to be attributed to the costs of the proceedings leading to this Award (the other half to be treated as being attributable to the costs of the proceedings leading to the Decision of 7 May 2012), and that 50% of such costs should be reimbursed by Claimant.\n\nThis figure excludes disbursements to ICSID of US $225,000, which are referred to in paragraph 9.2.10 below.\n\n9.2.10.\n\nIn addition, Claimant shall be liable to pay to Respondent a proportion of the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, and of the administrative fees and the charges for the use of the facilities of ICSID as finally notified by the Centre. Having regard to the consideration that the meaning and effect of Article VII.2 was an open question, the Majority considers that it would be appropriate for the Parties to share the costs of the Tribunal and the Centre incurred in the proceedings leading to the Decision of 7 May 2012. As regards the costs of the Tribunal and the Centre incurred in the proceedings leading to this Award, the Majority considers that it would be reasonable for the Claimant to pay 75% of these costs, and for the Respondent to pay 25%.\n\n**10.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns an application for annulment of the award rendered on July 2, 2013 in the arbitration proceeding between K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 \u0130n\u015faat \u0130thalat \u0130hracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi (\"**Applicant**\" or \"**Kili\u00e7**\") and Turkmenistan (\"**Turkmenistan**\" or \"**Respondent**\") (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/1), as rectified on September 20, 2013 and incorporating the Tribunal's Decision on Article VII.2 of the Turkey-Turkmenistan Bilateral Investment Treaty of May 7, 2012 (the \"**Award**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe application, dated January 13, 2014, was filed on January 16, 2014, in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18, 1965 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\"), and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\") (the \"**Application**\"). The Application was submitted within the time period provided for in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nThe original dispute was submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the ICSID Convention and the Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and Turkmenistan Concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments signed in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan on May 2, 1992, which entered into force on March 13, 1997 (the \"**BIT**\" or \"**Treaty**\").\n\n4.\n\nApplicant, Claimant to the original proceeding, is a construction company with registered offices in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n5.\n\nApplicant and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\". The Parties' respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n6.\n\nThe Award was rendered by an arbitral tribunal composed of Mr. William Rowley Q.C., (a national of Canada), Professor William W. Park (a national of the United States), and Professor Philippe Sands (a national of France and the United Kingdom) (the \"**Tribunal**\"). In the Award, the Tribunal dismissed Claimant's claim in its entirety for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that Claimant had failed to submit its dispute to the local courts of the Host State, which, as interpreted by the Tribunal, was a precondition to the existence of the Tribunal's jurisdiction under Article VII.2 of the BIT (the dispute resolution provision).\n\n7.\n\nThis decision of the *ad hoc* Committee rules on Applicant's allegations that the Tribunal \"acted in excess of power, failed to state reasons and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure when it concluded that in order to properly construe the provisions of Article VII.2, they had to be read as if the 'if' were not included.\"1 Applicant further alleges, *inter alia*, that \"the Tribunal based its interpretation of a legal text on extraordinary considerations that contravene the BIT and the intention of the drafters, as well as the canons of interpretation set in the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\" (the \"**Vienna Convention**\" or \"**VCLT**\").2\n\n*See* Memorial, para. 10. Article VII of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT in the authentic English version of the Treaty provides, in relevant part, as follows:  \n 1. Disputes between one of the Parties and one investor of the other Party, in connection with his investment, shall be notified in writing, including a [sic] detailed information, by the investor to the recipient Party of the investment. As far as possible, the investor and the concerned Party shall endeavour to settle these disputes by consultations and negotiations in good faith.  \n 2. If these desputes [sic] cannot be settled in this way within six month following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the dispute can be submitted, as the investor may choose, to:  \n (a) [ICSID];  \n (b) [UNCITRAL]; or  \n (c) [ICC International Court of Arbitration];  \nprovided that [if] the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been rendered within one year.\n\nMemorial, para. 11.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn January 27, 2014, the Secretary-General registered the Application in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and transmitted the Notice of Registration to the Parties. On that same day, the Parties were notified that pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of March 3, 2014, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that an *ad hoc* Committee had been constituted. The *ad hoc* Committee is composed of Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda (Spanish) as President, Professor Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel (German) and Professor Hi-Taek Shin (Korean) as Members (the \"**Committee**\"). The Parties were also informed that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date and that Ms. Mair\u00e9e Uran Bidegain would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of April 2, 2014, Applicant requested a continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award (the \"**Continuation Request**\"). Respondent filed a reply to the Continuation Request on April 14, 2014. Applicant submitted comments on the reply on April 29, 2014, and Respondent filed observations on Applicant's comments of late April on May 13, 2014.\n\n11.\n\nOn May 20, 2014, the Committee held a first session with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n12.\n\nOn May 27, 2014, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1, setting forth the procedural calendar and the general rules applicable to the proceedings.\n\n13.\n\nOn June 5, 2014, the Committee rendered its Decision on the Applicant's Continuation Request ordering that the stay of enforcement of the Award be maintained subject to provision of a bank guarantee by Applicant.\n\n14.\n\nOn July 21, 2014, Applicant informed the Committee and Respondent that it was not successful in securing an agreement with a banking institution to provide an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee in accordance with the Committee's decision of June 5, 2014. It further requested a short extension to provide the bank guarantee, which was granted by the Committee.\n\n15.\n\nOn August 11, 2014, Applicant confirmed that it could not secure the bank guarantee and asked the Committee to reconsider its decision. On August 15, 2014, Respondent requested the Committee to deny Applicant's request to change its decision.\n\n16.\n\nOn August 19, 2014, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 terminating the stay of enforcement of the Award under Arbitration Rule 54(3).\n\n17.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural schedule set forth in Procedural Order No. 1, Applicant filed its Memorial on Annulment on August 4, 2014, accompanied by a witness statement of Mrs. Zerg\u00fcl \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7 (the \"**Memorial**\"), and Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment on October 20, 2014 (the \"**Counter-Memorial**\").\n\n18.\n\nOn December 16, 2014, Applicant requested a brief extension of the time limit to file its Reply Memorial on Annulment, and the Committee granted the extension on the same day. On December 24, 2014, Applicant filed its Reply Memorial on Annulment dated December 23, 2014, accompanied by an expert opinion of Professor Rudolf Dolzer (the \"**Reply**\").\n\n19.\n\nOn February 25, 2015, Respondent filed its Rejoinder Memorial on Annulment (the \"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n20.\n\nA hearing on annulment was held at the World Bank's headquarters in Washington, D.C., U.S.A., on April 28, 2015 (the \"**Hearing**\").\n\n21.\n\nThe following persons attended the Hearing:\n\nMembers of the *ad hoc* Committee\n\nDr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda\n\nDr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel\n\nProf. Hi-Taek Shin\n\nSecretary of the *ad hoc* Committee\n\nMs. Mair\u00e9e Uran Bidegain\n\nApplicant\n\nDr. Hamid Gharavi Derains & Gharavi\n\nMr. Sergey Alekhin Derains & Gharavi\n\nMr. Daniel Parga Derains & Gharavi\n\nMs. Yasemin \u00c7etinel \u00c7etinel\n\nMs. Ay\u00e7a Aydin \u00c7etinel\n\nRespondent\n\nMr. Peter M. Wolrich Curtis, Mallet-Prevost Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMr. Ali R. G\u00fcrsel Curtis, Mallet-Prevost Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMs. Gabriela Alvarez-Avila Curtis, Mallet-Prevost Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMs. Sabrina A\u00efnouz Curtis, Mallet-Prevost Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMr. Francisco Sanchez Curtis, Mallet-Prevost Colt & Mosle LLP\n\n22.\n\nThe Parties filed their submissions on costs on May 29, 2015.\n\n23.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on July 13, 2015.\n\n**III. THE DISPUTE AND THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn 2005, 2007 and 2008, Kili\u00e7, or its affiliated companies, entered into a number of building contracts with various municipal governors, ministries and other officials of the Turkmen State in connection with projects in the Turkmen cities of Mary, Dashoguz and Ashgabat. Kili\u00e7 alleged that, during the course of construction of the various projects,3 issues arose between the contracting parties as to their respective performance under the relevant contracts.4\n\nThese projects included the construction of a conference center, certain residential and commercial buildings, a mosque, sports facilities, a university, and schools (*see* Memorial, para. 23).\n\nThe allegations include non-payment of advances and progress payments, failures to certify and pay in full for the completed projects, levying fines, drawing on bank guarantees, expulsion of Kili\u00e7 from the construction sites, confiscation of movable assets, harassment and coercion of Kili\u00e7's personnel and interference with the management of construction areas (*see* Memorial, para. 24).\n\n25.\n\nIn December 2009, Kili\u00e7 filed a request for arbitration before ICSID. The case was registered in January 2010. A Tribunal comprised of Professor Emmanuel Gaillard (President, French, appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID), Professor William W. Park (appointed by Claimant), and Professor Philippe Sands (appointed by Respondent), was constituted in December 2010 (the \"**First Tribunal**\").\n\n26.\n\nIn early February 2011, Respondent raised jurisdictional objections based on Claimant's non-compliance with Article VII.2 of the BIT and disagreements regarding whether the English, Russian and/or Turkish language versions were authentic versions of the BIT, and requested bifurcation of the proceedings between jurisdiction and merits.\n\n27.\n\nOn May 2, 2011, after the First Tribunal had held a procedural consultation with the Parties, and the Parties had filed their submissions on the issue of bifurcation of the proceedings and the nature of Respondent's jurisdictional objections in April 2011, Professor Gaillard resigned as President of the First Tribunal. The Tribunal was reconstituted on May 24, 2011, with Mr. J. William Rowley (Canadian, appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID) as its President (jointly with Professors Park and Sands, the \"**Tribunal**\").\n\n28.\n\nOn June 30, 2011, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Bifurcation and Early Determination of BIT Issues in which it decided against bifurcation, but also found that it would be appropriate to determine (a) the number of authentic versions of the BIT; and (b) to the extent there were authentic version(s) of the BIT in languages other than English \u2013 determine the accurate translations into English of the authentic version(s).5 The Tribunal also indicated that it wished to explore further the meaning and effect of Article VII.2 of the BIT and requested the Parties' submissions thereon (collectively referred to as the \"**BIT Issues**\").6\n\nInterpretation Decision, para. 1.19; Award, para. 1.2.18.\n\nInterpretation Decision, para. 1.20; Award, para. 1.2.19.\n\n29.\n\nOn January 20, 2012, a one-day hearing on the BIT Issues took place in London, United Kingdom (the \"**January hearing**\").\n\n30.\n\nOn May 7, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Article VII.2 of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT (the \"**Interpretation Decision**\"), in which it determined that:\n\n(a) there are two authentic versions of the BIT, being the English and Russian versions, both signed in Ashkabat on 2 May 1992;\n\n(b) the translation into English of the Russian version of the BIT that is found in Exhibit R-1 (revised) is to be treated as accurate;\n\n(c) the meaning and effect of Article VII.2 of the BIT is that a concerned investor is required to submit its dispute to the courts of the Contracting Party with which a dispute has arisen, and must not have received a final award within one year from the date of submission of its case to the local courts, before it can institute arbitration proceedings in one of the fora in the manner permitted by Article VII.2.7\n\nInterpretation Decision, para. 11.1; *see also* Award, para. 1.2.52.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal further determined that:\n\n[N]otwithstanding the parties' apparent consensus that the Tribunal should, if it is able to do so, provide a definitive ruling on its jurisdiction, the Tribunal notes that the parties have not yet provided submissions on the effect of non-compliance with the provisions of Article VII.2 of the BIT, assuming it to require mandatory recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan in the present case.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal invites the parties to make submissions, within 10 days of the receipt of this Decision, as to whether they wish to have an opportunity to make written/oral submissions with respect to the consequences to be drawn from Claimant's non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of Article VII.2.8\n\nInterpretation Decision, paras. 9.28 and 9.29; Award, para. 1.2.53.\n\n32.\n\nThe Interpretation Decision was signed by all members of the Tribunal.\n\n33.\n\nOn December 7, 2012, and further to two respective rounds of submissions by the Parties on the meaning and effect of Article VII.2, as specified in paragraph 31 above, a hearing on \"the single question of the jurisdictional effect of the requirement for prior recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan\" took place in London, United Kingdom.9\n\nAward, paras. 1.2.62-1.2.68.\n\n34.\n\nAt the close of this hearing, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file 10-page post-hearing submissions on \"the ability of this Tribunal to suspend these proceedings in the event that it would determine that the MFN provision does not encompass dispute resolution, and in the event it would determine that recourse to the Turkmenistan courts would not be futile,\" which the Parties submitted in due course, followed by their claims for costs and comments thereon.\n\n35.\n\nIn its Award, the Tribunal considered that there were \"three principal substantive questions to be addressed in relation to the single jurisdictional question,\"10 namely:\n\n(a) is Article VII.2's requirement for prior recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan a condition of Turkmenistan's consent to ICSID arbitration;\n\n(b) does the BIT's Article II.2 MFN provision encompass the BIT's [dispute resolution provisions] DRPs contained in Article VII.2, so as to permit Claimant to rely on the DRPs of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT; and\n\n(c) in the event that Claimant is not exempted from the mandatory prior recourse provisions of Article VII.2 by reason of the operation of Article II.2 MFN provision, is it otherwise exempted because compliance with the provisions of Article VII.2 would have been ineffective or futile?\n\n*Id*. para. 5.1.1.\n\n36.\n\nThe Award was signed by all members of the Tribunal. Professor William W. Park also issued a Separate Opinion (the \"**Separate Opinion**\"). The Majority of the Tribunal composed of Mr. Rowley and Prof. Sands (the \"**Majority**\"), explains the object of the Separate Opinion as follows:\n\nIn his Separate Opinion, our colleague Professor Park concludes, like the majority, that the wording of Article VII.1 imposes jurisdictional preconditions requiring notice of a dispute and an endeavour to settle by negotiation. He departs from the majority, however, in finding that Article VII.2's requirements for local litigation and \"no-judgment-within-a-year\" are not conditions precedent and go only to 'ripeness' and the admissibility of the claim, as opposed to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.11\n\n*Id*. para. 6.5.1.\n\n37.\n\nIn its Award of July 2, 2013, the Majority of the Tribunal declined to uphold jurisdiction and held that:\n\n(i) Article VII of the BIT expressly articulates a multi-layered, sequential dispute resolution system providing for a sequence of separate dispute resolution procedures through which a dispute will escalate, if not resolved, in the former step. The Tribunal views the inclusion of such a multi-tiered system [\u2026] to be in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention;12\n\n(ii) According to the Majority, the adoption of language which requires that a series of steps *shall* be taken, and which provide for a right to arbitrate, *provided that* another step has been taken, is an obvious construction of a condition precedent. [\u2026] When such conditions are set out in the DRPs of a BIT (*as conditions of the Contracting Parties' offer to arbitrate*), [\u2026] compliance with them constitutes a jurisdictional requirement [not a question of admissibility], in the sense that a failure to meet the conditions has the consequence that there exists no jurisdiction to be exercised;13\n\n(iii) In the absence of jurisdiction, the Tribunal has no power to suspend these proceedings even if it was minded to do so;14\n\n(iv) Article II.2's MFN provision of the BIT, does not encompass or apply to the BIT's dispute resolution provision so as to permit Claimant to rely on the dispute resolution provision of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT, which did not require prior recourse to local courts;15\n\n(v) Based on the evidentiary record, the Tribunal was unable to conclude that it would have been ineffective or futile for Claimant to have sought to comply with Article VII.2's requirement for prior recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan. Accordingly, Claimant was not exempted from the application of Article VII.2.16\n\n*See Id.*, para. 6.2.6.\n\n*See Id.* paras. 6.2.9 and 6.3.15.\n\n*See Id.* para. 6.6.1.\n\n*See Id.* para. 7.9.1.\n\n*See Id.* para. 8.1.21.\n\n**IV. THE APPLICABLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK: ARTICLE 52 OF THE ICSID CONVENTION**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention provides in relevant part:\n\n(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n(2) The application shall be made within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered [\u2026].\n\n(3) On receipt of the request the Chairman shall forthwith appoint from the Panel of Arbitrators an *ad hoc* Committee of three persons. [\u2026]. The Committee shall have the authority to annul the award or any part thereof on any of the grounds set forth in paragraph (1).\n\n(4) The provisions of Articles 41-45, 48, 49, 53 and 54, and of Chapters VI and VII shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings before the Committee.\n\n39.\n\nRule 50(1) of the Arbitration Rules further confirms the grounds for annulment set forth under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n40.\n\nApplicant has applied for annulment on grounds of manifest excess of powers, failure to give reasons and serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure. In their pleadings, the Parties interpret differently the pertinent provisions of Article 52. The Committee will address at the outset the Parties' different understandings of Article 52.\n\n41.\n\nThe Committee has considered the extensive factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in their written submissions and oral argument during the Hearing. Below, the Committee discusses the arguments of the Parties that it considers relevant for its decision. The Committee's reasoning addresses what the Committee considers to be determinative factors in deciding the disputed issues and, accordingly, the relief sought by the Parties.\n\n*1. MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS*\n------------------------------\n\nA. *The Positions of the Parties*\n---------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nApplicant has submitted that the reference to powers in Article 52(1)(b) is to be understood as to those powers that stem from the agreement of the parties to submit their dispute to the arbitral tribunal and it is with reference to the agreement of the parties and the \"powers\" stemming therefrom that it must be determined whether a tribunal has exceeded its powers. According to Applicant, \"manifest\" is to be understood in the sense of significant or consequential and not necessarily obvious. When an extensive analysis may be required to determine whether a tribunal has exceeded its powers that does not mean that that excess is not manifest. Applicant discusses three instances where a tribunal manifestly exceeds its powers.\n\n43.\n\nFirst, when it exercises jurisdiction if none exist or conversely when a tribunal fails to exercise the jurisdiction it has. Such failure, as argued by Applicant, constitutes always a manifest excess of powers, while \"if an error is committed in relation to the merits, it will rarely constitute an excess of power and rarely mandate the annulment of an award. A jurisdictional error is of an entirely different character. It manifestly constitutes an excess of power in all cases.\"17 Applicant refers to the report of its legal expert Prof. Dolzer who notes Schreuer's comment that \"[t]he distinction between non-application of the proper law and erroneous application of the proper law is relevant to questions of the merits but not to questions of jurisdiction. An erroneous application of the law applicable to jurisdiction may lead to an excess of powers and may be a ground for annulment.\"18 Applicant submits that *ad hoc* Committees that have diverged on the standard of misapplication of the law have converged in that \"the standard required for a tribunal to manifestly exceed its powers is lower with respect to misapplication of the principles of treaty interpretation regarding jurisdictional issues.\"19\n\nReply, para. 50.\n\n*Id*. para. 71.\n\n*Id*. para. 72\n\n44.\n\nSecond, failure by a tribunal to apply the proper law may amount to an excess of powers. Under this heading Applicant includes cases in which the tribunal purports to apply the applicable law but in reality applies rules of law other than those agreed by the parties or *de facto* disregards a provision of the BIT or of the Vienna Convention.\n\n45.\n\nThird, gross misapplication of the law has led to the annulment of arbitral awards on grounds of manifest excess of powers. Applicant contends that, \"[\u2026] in fact a full review, which suggests even an appeal, is particularly warranted when dealing with jurisdictional issues.\"20\n\n*Id*. para. 73.\n\n46.\n\nFor Respondent, the legal standard of manifest excess of powers is not lower with respect to jurisdictional determinations than it is for determination of the merits. Respondent recalls that Applicant's thesis has been rejected by commentators and not supported by annulment decisions. There is no basis for this distinction in the ICSID Convention and it was rejected by the drafters of the Convention. An excess of powers is manifest when it is self-evident, easy to discern.\n\n47.\n\nRespondent points out that awards have been annulled for failure to apply the proper law only in four occasions in extreme circumstances where the tribunal ignored provisions of the applicable law or the applicable law as a whole. Awards have not been annulled when the law has only partly been applied or has been applied incorrectly; only a \"gross or egregious error that effectively amounts to the non-application of the proper law\"21 would justify annulment. Hence consistent with this premise mere divergence of interpretations cannot justify annulment.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 47, citation of *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Application for Annulment of the Award, June 29, 2010 (CLA-34), para. 164.\n\nB. *Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Parties diverge on the meaning of \"manifest\" and on whether the threshold of manifest excess of powers is a lower threshold with regard to jurisdiction. On the meaning of \"manifest\" the divergence relates to whether manifest means obvious without need for deep analysis or the excess of powers may be manifest even if it requires extensive analysis.\n\n49.\n\nThe Parties have referred to decisions of annulment committees in support of either understanding of the meaning of \"manifest.\" While the present Committee is not bound to use the same criteria as previous committees, it will consider and take into account for its own decision reasoning used by previous committees regarding the relevant issues.\n\n50.\n\nThe *Repsol ad hoc* committee understood manifest in the sense of \"obvious by itself\" simply by reading the award.22 The *Wena ad hoc* committee understood \"manifest\" as \"self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. When the latter happens the excess of power is no longer manifest.\"23 Similarly, the *CDC* *ad hoc* committee stated: \"[\u2026] the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal's conduct, if susceptible of argument 'one way or the other', is not manifest.\"24\n\n*Repsol YPF Ecuador, S.A. v.

Thus it concluded that, \"the Tribunal exceeded its powers in the sense of Article 52(1)(b), in that the Tribunal, having jurisdiction over the Tucum\u00e1n claims failed to decide those claims. Given the clear and serious implications of that decision for Claimants in terms of Article 8(2) of the BIT, and the surrounding circumstances, the Committee can only conclude that the excess of powers was manifest.\"25\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux) v.

It seems to this Committee that a manifest excess of power implies that the excess of power should at once be textually obvious and substantively serious.\"26\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7), Decision of the *Ad Hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of Mr. Soufraki (\"***Soufraki*** **Decision**\") (CLA-35), para. 40.\n\n53.\n\nThe Committee concurs in that it is unnecessary to consider the two approaches as alternatives. The term 'manifest' would by itself seem to correspond to 'obvious' or 'evident', but it follows from the very nature of annulment as an exceptional measure that it should not be resorted to unless the tribunal's excess had serious consequences for a party.\n\n54.\n\nThe second discrepancy in the Parties' views relates to the application of the proper law in the jurisdictional context. It is undisputed that failure to apply the proper law is one instance of the tribunal exceeding its powers by acting outside the scope of the Parties' agreement to arbitrate. The Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID (the \"**Background Paper**\") notes that annulment committees concur in that \"a Tribunal's complete failure to apply the proper law or acting *ex aequo et bono* without agreement of the parties to do so as required by the ICSID Convention could constitute a manifest excess of powers.\"27\n\nBackground Paper on Annulment For the Administrative Council of ICSID, August 10, 2012 (\"**Background Paper**\") (CLA-67), para. 94.\n\n55.\n\nApplicant has argued that a lesser standard applies in the context of a decision on jurisdiction. Applicant contends that any jurisdictional mistake is necessarily a manifest excess of powers. This argument has been made before other annulment committees, but it has been rejected on the ground that there is no basis in Article 52(1)(b) to make an exception for issues of jurisdiction. Faced with the assertion that all jurisdictional errors should be manifest, the *Soufraki ad hoc* committee saw,\n\n[\u2026] no reason why the rule that an excess of power must be manifest in order to be annullable should be disregarded when the question under discussion is a jurisdictional one. Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention does not distinguish between findings on jurisdiction and findings on the merits. As noted by the ad hoc committee in MTD Chile; '\u2026 the grounds for annulment do not distinguish formally \u2026 between jurisdictional errors and errors concerning the merits of the dispute and \u2026 manifest excess of powers could well occur on a question of merits.'\n\nIt follows that the requirement that an excess of power must be \"*manifest*\" applies equally if the question is one of jurisdiction. A jurisdictional error is not a separate category of excess of power. Only if an ICSID tribunal commits a *manifest* excess of power, whether on a matter related to jurisdiction or to the merits, is there a basis for annulment.28\n\n*Soufraki* Decision (CLA-35), paras. 118-119. *See also* *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Per\u00fa, S.A. v.

FAILURE TO STATE REASONS*\n-----------------------------\n\nA. *Positions of the Parties*\n-----------------------------\n\n57.\n\nAccording to Applicant, an award falls short of this requirement when it fails to give reasons on an issue or to deal with a question, or the reasons are insufficient, inadequate, frivolous or contradictory. By reference to the *Soufraki* case, Applicant understands that reasons are insufficient or inadequate when reasons cannot in themselves be a reasonable basis for the solution arrived at by a tribunal.29\n\nMemorial, para. 152 (referring to the *Soufraki* Decision (CLA-35), paras 122-123).\n\n58.\n\nRespondent agrees that failure to state reasons justifies the annulment of the award, but disputes that failure to state reasons be confused with a failure to state correct or convincing reasons. Respondent submits that, \"an examination of reasons cannot be transformed into a re-examination of the correctness of the factual and legal premises on which the award is based.\"30 According to Respondent, the threshold for failure to state reasons is very high, it is not different for jurisdictional decisions, and annulment on this ground should only occur in a clear case and when a tribunal fails to state any reasons.31\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 63.\n\n*Id.* para. 60.\n\nB. *Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Parties differ on how the ground of annulment for failure to state reasons should be applied in the case of a jurisdictional award and on the level of scrutiny by the Committee of the reasons themselves. Applicant argues that sufficient and adequate reasons have greater importance when jurisdictional issues are involved and that the Committee should consider the adequacy or sufficiency of reasons.\n\n60.\n\nIt is undisputed that a reader of an award should be able to follow the reasoning of the tribunal and how the reasoning leads the tribunal to its decision. As expressed in the often quoted statement of the *MINE ad hoc* committee, \"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.\"32 This statement applies equally to awards on jurisdiction and awards on the merits. As in the case of manifest excess of powers, the ICSID Convention does not make in this respect a distinction between jurisdictional or merit issues. No jurisprudence has been brought to the attention of the Committee in support of the distinction advocated by Applicant except the reference to Sir Frank Berman's Dissenting Opinion in the *Luchetti* Annulment Decision33 which is not shared by the majority of that committee. For the reasons pointed out above in this paragraph and with regard to manifest excess of powers under the ICSID Convention, the review of the present Committee of the reasons for denial of jurisdiction in the Award should not be more or less strict than a review of reasons in an award on the merits.\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Decision on the Application by Guinea for Partial Annulment of the Arbitral Award dated January 6, 1988 (CLA-39), para. 5.09.\n\n*See* Reply, para. 81, n.103 (referring to *Lucchetti* Annulment Decision, Dissenting Opinion of Sir Franklin Berman (CLA-48)).\n\n61.\n\nRespondent has taken issue with Applicant's contention that reasons should be sufficient and adequate. Applicant's contention is based on the statement in *Soufraki* to the effect that \"even short of a total failure, some defects in the statement of reasons could give rise to annulment [\u2026]. [I]nsufficient or inadequate reasons refer to reasons that cannot, in themselves, be a reasonable basis for the solution arrived at.\"34 Applicant also quotes the *Soufraki ad hoc* committee's holding that \"insufficient or inadequate reasons as well as contradictory reasons can spur an annulment.\"35\n\nQuoted in Reply, para. 152.\n\n*Id*.\n\n62.\n\nThe Committee first observes that a word of caution is in order in respect of use of words such as \"adequate\" or \"sufficient\" in the context of annulment. The doctrine and the case law warn about the danger of the review of reasons becoming an appellate review: \"[o]nce an *ad hoc* committee starts looking into whether the tribunal explanation is sufficient to constitute a statement of reasons, it has already embarked upon a quality control of the award. The formal test of the presence of a statement of reasons blends into a substantive test of adequacy and correctness and the distinction between annulment and appeal becomes blurred.\"36 The *Soufraki ad hoc* committee quoted by Applicant was aware that the assessment of the insufficiency or inadequacy of reasons might easily place an *ad hoc* committee in a court of appeal role. It stated: \"[i]nsufficient or inadequate reasons as a ground for annulment have thus to be distinguished from *wrong or unconvincing reasons*.\" In support of this statement, the *Soufraki ad hoc* committee refers to the *Wena ad hoc* committee's explanation that \"Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the *ad hoc* Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal's decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not.\"37\n\nC. Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2009) (CLA-32), p. 1003, at para. 363.\n\n*Soufraki* Decision (CLA-35), para. 123. Emphasis in the original.\n\n63.\n\nThe *Soufraki ad hoc* committee also refers to the *Vivendi I ad hoc* committee. This committee provided what can be considered the leading statement on the application of Article 52(1)(e):\n\n[\u2026] it is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons [\u2026]. Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.38\n\nIn the Committee's view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and the second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision.\"39\n\n*Id.* para. 124, referring to *Vivendi I* Decision, para. 64.\n\n*Vivendi I* Decision, para. 65.\n\n64.\n\nTo conclude on this point, the present Committee, consistent with its limited role, will not judge the correctness or persuasiveness of the reasons provided by the Tribunal but only determine whether the Award \"enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B.\"\n\n*3. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. *Positions of the Parties*\n-----------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Parties agree that the rule of procedure must be fundamental and the departure must be serious, but diverge on the meaning of \"serious.\" For Applicant, \"serious\" means that the departure from the fundamental rule may have had an impact on the tribunal's award. On the other hand, Respondent argues that \"serious\" means that the violation of the fundamental rule of procedure caused the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have been if the rule had been observed.\n\nB. *Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Committee wishes first to clarify that the Background Paper does not acknowledge Respondent's statement that \"*[a]d hoc* committees have consistently interpreted the departure to be 'serious' if it has a material impact on the tribunal's decision [\u2026]\"40 The Background Paper only acknowledges that \"*[s]ome ad hoc* Committees have required that the departure have a material impact on the outcome of the award for the annulment to succeed.\"41 Evidently what the Background Paper acknowledges is that a few *ad hoc* committees had required that the departure must have a material impact.\n\nRejoinder, para. 17.\n\nBackground Paper (CLA-67), para. 101. Emphasis added by the Committee.\n\n67.\n\nThe Committee also notes that the determination of \"whether an alleged fundamental rule of procedure has been seriously breached is usually very fact specific, involving an examination of the conduct of the proceeding before the Tribunal.\"42 The fact specific nature of this determination led an annulment committee to state that \"the assessment of the seriousness criterion [\u2026] should always be made on a case-by-case basis,\"43 which may make difficult the comparison of the decisions of *ad hoc* committees adduced by the Parties.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Malicorp Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18), Decision on the Application for Annulment, July 3, 2013 (RLA-35), para. 37.\n\n68.\n\nThe Committee further notes that each party claims the *Wena* Annulment Decision to its advantage. Respondent finds support in the statement \"[i]n order to be a 'serious' departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such rule been observed.\"44 On the other hand, Applicant refers to the dismissal of the request for annulment because the applicant in *Wena* did not show the impact that this issue may have had on the award.45\n\n*Wena* Decision (CLA-62), para. 58.\n\nReply, para. 89.\n\n69.\n\nThe Committee observes that Professor Schreuer in his analysis of the meaning of \"serious\" in the practice of annulment committees reaches a conclusion in favor of the potential effect on the award relying on the same sentence of *Wena* as Respondent does in this proceeding to opposite effect. He comments as follows: \"[i]n order to be serious the departure must be more than minimal. It must be substantial. In addition, the cases confirm that this departure must potentially have caused the tribunal to render an award 'substantially different from what it would have awarded had the rule been observed.'\"46\n\nC. Schreuer *et al.* (CLA-32), p. 982, at para. 287. The quotation is from *Wena*, precisely the same as used by Respondent in defense of its position.\n\n70.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that the choice between the two positions whether the departure had a material effect or had the potential to have a material effect will depend on the circumstances of the case and, therefore, it does not lend itself to a choice in abstract, valid in all cases. For instance, it is conceivable, to use an obvious example, that the right to be heard by a party is violated. If the tribunal has not heard that party on a relevant matter for its decision, it will never be known whether the tribunal would have decided differently had it heard the party in question. However in such a case it would be sufficient for an annulment committee to rely on the potential material effect on the award.\n\n71.\n\nThe Committee will be guided by these considerations in its analysis of the arguments of the Parties.\n\n**V. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n----------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Committee's consideration of the Parties' arguments follows the structure used by Applicant in its Memorial on Annulment. Applicant contends that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to give reasons and departed seriously from fundamental rules of procedure in respect of the meaning of Article VII.2 of the BIT and of the effect of Article VII.2 as interpreted by the Tribunal. Applicant has also pleaded that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to give reasons for its decision on costs.\n\n*1. THE MEANING OF ARTICLE VII.2 OF THE BIT*\n--------------------------------------------\n\nA. *Manifest Excess of Powers*\n------------------------------\n\n*a)*  *Summary of the Positions of the Parties*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nApplicant claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers on seven grounds. First, Applicant argues that the Tribunal improperly allocated the burden of proof. Respondent had raised the objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and it was for Respondent to prove it. According to Applicant, when a respondent raises an affirmative defense it is for that respondent to prove the elements comprising such defense. In this case, Respondent raised as defense that Article VII.2 should be read as imposing a mandatory recourse to local courts for one year before resorting to international arbitration; the burden of proof was on Respondent.\n\n74.\n\nApplicant points out that Respondent did not submit any documentary or testimonial proof showing that the parties to the BIT intended to impose a mandatory recourse to the judiciary. Applicant further notes that none of the BITs concluded by Respondent and publicly available provide for mandatory recourse to the local courts. Applicant submits that the Tribunal should have dismissed the objection for lack of proof and exercised jurisdiction on this ground alone.\n\n75.\n\nSecond, Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to exercise jurisdiction, as it was entitled to do, on the plain reading of the English and Russians versions of the BIT. Applicant explains that the English authentic version served as the negotiation text used by the BIT parties. Applicant further argues that the disputed words \"if\" and \"and\" in Article VII.2 have both meaning: \"[t]he word 'if' introduces the hypothetical situation where an investor, at its own discretion, has chosen to bring a dispute before the local courts. In turn the word 'and' is the link between the situation where the investor has had recourse to the local courts and the fact that no award has been rendered within the year.\"47 The revised Russian translation eliminates \"if\". According to Applicant, \"to the extent that the Tribunal relied on the Russian version of the BIT to interpret Article VII.2, the interpretation should have been based on the translation by an independent expert and not on a revised interpretation of Respondent's hired gun.\"48\n\nMemorial, para. 207.\n\n*Id*. para. 212. Underlining in the original.\n\n76.\n\nThird, Applicant questions the reasons for the Tribunal not to be persuaded by the decisions in the cases of *Rumeli* and *Sistem* because both of them were brought under BITs containing the same language as Article VII.2. Applicant points out that neither state party to these cases ever tried to annul these awards, nor sought to clarify the clauses in their BITs with Turkey, which are similar to Article VII.2. Applicant contends that \"[b]y de facto disregarding the case law on this very same point in relation to BITs concluded moreover within the same relevant period of time with neighboring Turkic States and Turkey and/or the corresponding accepted practice amongst States, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\"49\n\n*Id*. para. 229.\n\n77.\n\nFourth, Applicant contends that, assuming that an interpretation of the text of Article VII.2 was necessary, the Tribunal failed to interpret the BIT in good faith, to give effect to the object and purpose of the BIT, and ignored the ordinary meaning of Article VII.2, the statements of Turkish officials and Applicant's legal expert. In contrast, the Tribunal relied on assumptions made by Respondent's experts who were not involved in drafting, signing and ratifying any of the four BITs with the Central Asia Turkic States.\n\n78.\n\nFifth, according to Applicant, Turkey's intent that recourse to the local judiciary is optional is confirmed by Turkey's own practice. Applicant points out that out of a total of 85 BITs signed by Turkey only four require mandatory recourse to the local courts. Applicant argues that this is not a policy concern of Turkmenistan since \"no other publicly available BITs signed by Turkmenistan include a provision similar to that in Article VII.2 [\u2026]\"50 Applicant adds in support of its argument that when Turkey has been a respondent in ICSID arbitration it did not \"raise the mandatory nature of the recourse to local courts before resorting to arbitration as a jurisdictional objection, even though several of the arbitrations it was involved in were based on BITs that included provisions very similar and, in some cases, identical to the disputed one in the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT without the investor having exercised any recourse before the Turkish judiciary.\"51\n\n*Id*. para. 296.\n\n*Id*. para. 297.\n\n79.\n\nSixth, Applicant claims that to interpret Article VII.2 as requiring prior recourse to the local courts violates the object and purpose of the BIT and leads to an absurd result. Applicant points out that the interpretation of the Tribunal would mean that \"Turkey prompted and negotiated a legal instrument that imposed on its own nationals, which were the only investors at the time and for a foreseeable future under the BIT, to litigate their investment dispute with the Turkmen State before the newly established Turkmen courts. The formula, as moreover interpreted by the Tribunal, would allow a Turkmen court to dismiss under any legal pretext the claims of the Turkish investors against the State within less than a year to be exempt from any liability, save for an action for denial of justice, which need to meet a higher threshold.\"52\n\n*Id.* para. 302.\n\n80.\n\nSeventh, Applicant adduces here various grounds related to the reliance of the Tribunal on the revised English translation, on a linguistic expert to interpret the authentic English version of the BIT, on the non-existent authentic version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT, and on the Turkish translation of the English authentic version as published in the Official Gazette. Applicant contends that each of these instances are independent violations of Article 52(1)(b), particularly because they were arbitrarily imposed over Claimant.\n\n81.\n\nAs regards Respondent's request that certain documents be rejected by the Committee,53 Applicant argues that they are not new under the terms of Procedural Order No. 1, because Mrs. Ozbilgi\u00e7 did not provide new evidence in her witness statement and affidavit. The submission letters of Turkish BITs to Turkey's parliament (the \"Submission Letters\") \"relate to all three grounds for annulment raised by Kili\u00e7 in these proceedings, and in any event are intrinsically linked to the Turkish BITs and publicly available,\" and the same applies to the Turkish BITs referred therein.54\n\n*See infra*, para. 90.\n\nReply, para. 11.\n\n82.\n\nRespondent denies that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law. Respondent contends that the Tribunal interpreted and applied the relevant provisions of the BIT in light of the Vienna Convention. Respondent equally affirms that the Tribunal did not commit any error of law and in support refers to similar interpretative approaches adopted by tribunals in the interpretation of agreements concluded in multiple languages. According to Respondent, \"[a] tribunal does not manifestly exceed its powers by adopting an interpretation of the applicable law that conforms with the interpretation of some prior tribunals and differs with that of others.\"55\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 76.\n\n83.\n\nAs to the burden of proof, Respondent disputes that the Tribunal misallocated the burden of proof because, \"while it is true that Respondent is the applicant with respect to the objection to jurisdiction at issue, it is also true that it is Claimant that bore the burden of establishing Turkmenistan's consent to arbitration.\"56 Respondent further affirms to be a vain effort of Applicant to seek support in Article 26 of the ICSID Convention for the allegation that Turkmenistan bore the burden of proof. Article 26 does not require any specific allocation of the burden of proof to determine whether the prior recourse to the local courts is optional or mandatory. Moreover, according to Respondent, the Tribunal's Interpretation Decision was not grounded on Kili\u00e7's failure to meet its burden of proof in this respect. Respondent points out that, under the guise of the alleged misapplication of the rules on burden of proof, Applicant seeks a *de novo* review of the Tribunal's assessment of all the evidence, which the Committee cannot do.\n\n*Id*. para. 81.\n\n84.\n\nThen Respondent turns to the argument that the Tribunal failed to apply the plain meaning of the English and Russian versions of the BIT. Respondent notes that Applicant, in its Request for Arbitration and relying only on the English version of the BIT, \"recognized that, on its face, Article VII.2 of the BIT mandatorily requires prior submission of a dispute to national courts.\"57 Respondent further notes that only at the time the submissions on bifurcation were presented to the Tribunal did Kili\u00e7 change its position. In this respect, Respondent argues that, \"Kili\u00e7's own change of position on the meaning of the English version of Article VII.2 of the BIT is the clearest proof that, as the Tribunal correctly found, there is no plain meaning of the English authentic version.\"58\n\n*Id*. para. 90.\n\n*Id.*\n\n85.\n\nRespondent also points out that, to elicit the plain meaning of Article VII.2, Applicant needs to rewrite the text of the English version and undermines the \"plain meaning\" argument. Respondent argues that the revised translation conveys precisely the complete sense of the Russian text. Respondent affirms that it is inadmissible that Applicant challenges the Tribunal's reliance on Respondent's revised English translation of the authentic Russian version of the BIT when Applicant itself never submitted an English translation of the authentic Russian version of Article VII despite the request of the Tribunal to do so in Procedural Order No. 1. Furthermore, Kili\u00e7 never agreed or consented to the first translation of the Russian version submitted by Respondent and objected to the appointment of an independent expert to confirm the revised Russian translation.\n\n86.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Kili\u00e7's new translation and analysis of the authentic Russian version are inadmissible because they are entirely new arguments never made by Applicant in the arbitration proceeding, and the new translation is incorrect and ambiguous.\n\n87.\n\nIn respect of the third ground relied on by Applicant, Respondent points out that there is no *stare decisis* in international arbitration, at most, previous awards may provide guidance, but an arbitral tribunal is not bound by them. In any case Respondent disputes that the Tribunal disregarded the *Sistem* and *Rumeli* awards. According to Respondent, \"the Tribunal carefully reviewed and studied the *Rumeli* and *Sistem* awards and found them unpersuasive for the purpose of interpreting the prior recourse requirement in Article VII.2 of the BIT.\"59 Furthermore, divergence of interpretation does not warrant annulment for manifest excess of powers.\n\n*Id.* para. 118.\n\n88.\n\nRespondent contends that the Tribunal interpreted the text of Article VII.2 in strict accordance with the principles of interpretation in the Vienna Convention and did not violate the object and purpose of the BIT in its analysis of the ordinary meaning of the terms in each of the authentic versions. Respondent surmises that, \"[w]hatever policy considerations Turkey and Turkmenistan may have taken into account in agreeing upon the Article VII.2 requirement of prior recourse, they specifically and expressly have chosen to do so and their choice must be respected.\"60\n\n*Id.* para. 125.\n\n89.\n\nRespondent rejects the argument of Applicant that the Tribunal did not give proper weight to the evidence submitted in the underlying arbitration. Respondent affirms again that an annulment is not an appeal and annulment committees do not have the authority to review the original tribunal's factual findings or to reassess the probative value of the evidence submitted. Furthermore, even if the documents in question were found \"to represent Turkey's view of Article VII.2, they could not constitute an authoritative interpretation of the intention of the parties to the BIT in the absence of an endorsement of that view by Turkmenistan.\"61\n\n*Id.* para. 133.\n\n90.\n\nRespondent refers to the new statement of Mrs. \u00d4zb\u00eelgi\u00e7 submitted for the first time in this annulment proceeding. According to Respondent, this statement should be rejected because it is new evidence not submitted in the underlying arbitration and should be disregarded pursuant to Sections 16.2 and 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1. In any case, Mrs. \u00d4zbilgi\u00e7 was not fluent in English at the time the BIT was prepared, did not personally participate in discussions with the Turkic Republic's representatives on their BITs with Turkey and her \"alleged understandings or intentions when she was a junior member of GDFI staff in 1992 were obviously not universally held either by her colleagues or the other State parties to Turkey's BITs, nor were they conveyed in the English text of Article VII.2 in a manner that would be understood by others as she supposedly intended.\"62 Respondent also objects to the introduction in the annulment proceeding of the \"Submission Letters\" as well as the introduction of certain BITs, all on the basis that these documents were not before the Tribunal and are unrelated to the grounds for annulment as required by Procedural Order No.1.63\n\n*Id*. para. 140.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 32.\n\n91.\n\nRespondent turns to Applicant's criticism of the Award because the Tribunal did not conclude, based on the BIT Submission Letter to parliament, that recourse to local courts is optional. Respondent points out that the BIT Submission Letter is just a unilateral statement, while the BIT as published in the Official Gazette has the status of law in Turkey. Moreover the Tribunal considered carefully the BIT Submission Letter and decided that it was trumped by the text of the BIT in the Official Gazette.\n\n92.\n\nRespondent also addresses the argument of Kili\u00e7 related to other BITs for purposes of determining the meaning of Article VII.2. Respondent first points out that Applicant's argument based on Turkish practice is based on reference to Turkish BITs that were not submitted in the underlying arbitration. Respondent contends that, in any case, the examples of BITs referred to by Applicant do not support Applicant's preferred interpretation. Thus, the Turkey-Hungary treaty was done in three languages and the Hungarian version contains a mandatory local court requirement; the Turkey-Switzerland treaty was also done in three languages and the Turkish version requires first recourse to the local courts; the Turkish version of the Turkey-Croatia BIT includes a similar requirement. Respondent affirms that it is not possible to find a clear policy of Turkey. Turkey signed BITs with mandatory prior submission of a dispute to the local courts before and after the treaties with the Turkic Republics.\n\n93.\n\nRespondent disputes Applicant's contention that the Tribunal's interpretation of Article VII.2 leads to an absurd result. Respondent explains: \"Article VII.2 of the BIT provides for a mandatory multi-tiered mechanism requiring first a six-month period of settlement negotiations, then the submission of the dispute to the national courts, and only thereafter submission to an international tribunal if the national courts have not rendered a decision within one year.\"64 According to Respondent, this is not unusual in BIT practice and cannot be criticized as being absurd.\n\n*Id.* para. 158.\n\n94.\n\nOn Applicant's seventh ground, Respondent argues that the Committee does not have authority to review the Tribunal's original factual findings.\n\n*b)*  *Analysis of the Committee*\n---------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Committee needs to address the issue of whether the witness statement of Mrs. \u00d4zbilgi\u00e7, the \"Submission Letters\" and the Turkish BITs not submitted in the arbitration proceedings are admissible under Procedural Order No. 1. Article 16.2 of this order allows the submission of additional documentation provided that \"[\u2026] any and all additional evidence be related exclusively to the particular grounds for annulment raised in the Application for annulment and not to the underlying dispute in the original arbitration.\" The Parties disagree on the relation of the additional documents to the grounds of annulment. For Respondent, Claimant has submitted the new documents as part of its arguments seeking to appeal the Award rather than its annulment. At the Hearing Respondent's counsel stated:\n\nIt is precisely because annulment is not and cannot be an appeal that the new documents submitted by Claimant for the first time in this Annulment Proceeding must be disregarded. And so it's not a matter, in our view, of your looking at them, studying them, and weighing them however you wish; our position is they must be totally disregarded because these documents include an entirely new Witness Statement by Mrs. Ozb\u00eelgi\u00e7, who had never presented a Witness Statement in the prior arbitration and also a number of additional BITs and BIT Submission Letters which were not before the Kili\u00e7 Tribunal. And because they were not before the Kili\u00e7 Tribunal, they have no bearing on the Tribunal's reasoning, and they have no bearing on any relevance to Claimant's allegation of manifest excess of powers by that Tribunal because the Tribunal did not have those documents before it.65\n\nTr. 76:14-22, 77:1-9.\n\n96.\n\nIn the view of the Committee the terms of Procedural Order No.1 are not as trenchant as interpreted by Respondent. The key criterion is whether the new documentation relates to the grounds of annulment rather than whether they were documents before the Tribunal. This clarification notwithstanding, the documents objected by Respondent had been submitted in support of arguments that seek a reinterpretation of Article VII.2 by this Committee, a task that exceeds its mandate as explained by the Committee later in this decision.\n\n97.\n\nAnother preliminary matter to be disposed by the Committee is the relevance of the *Sehil* Decision on Jurisdiction of February 13, 201566. This decision was issued after Applicant submitted its Reply and before Respondent submitted the Rejoinder. The arbitration in that case is an ICSID arbitration brought under the BIT. Counsel to the parties in that arbitration is the same as in these proceedings. Both Parties have discussed the *Sehil* decision *in extenso* during the Hearing and Respondent in the Rejoinder. Both, the Tribunal and the *Sehil* tribunal agree that Article VII(2) is ambiguous. The *Sehil* tribunal reached, however, a different interpretation of Article VII.2 from that of the Tribunal. Evidently the Tribunal did not have before it the *Sehil* decision and while the *Sehil* tribunal was aware of the Award and the Interpretation Decision it nonetheless reached a different conclusion.\n\n*Muhammet \u00c7ap and Sehil Insaat Endustri ve Ticaret Ltd. Sti. v. Turkmenistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/6), Decision on Respondent's Objection to Jurisdiction under Article VII (2) of the Turkey-Turkmenistan Bilateral Investment Treaty, February 13, 2015 (RLA-30).\n\n98.\n\nApplicant relies on the *Sehil* decision in support of its argument that the Tribunal exceeded its powers and submits that the *Sehil* decision warrants annulment of the Kili\u00e7 Award \"as otherwise the system would turn into the luck of the draw.\"67 Respondent in turn points out that \"there is no basis from *Sehil* to find that there was a manifest excess of power by [the] K[i]li\u00e7 Tribunal in interpreting VII. 2\"68 Respondent further asserts that there is no *stare decisis* and that it is \"not the role of an *ad hoc* committee to bring about consistency between conflicting interpretations of an ambiguous decision because a definitive answer to something that is ambiguous may not exist.\"69\n\nTr. pp.26:22; 27:1-2; 67:19-22.\n\nTr. pp. 129:21-22; 130:1.\n\nTr. pp 133:20-22; 134:1-2.\n\n99.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that just because a more recent non-binding interpretation of an ambiguous provision differs from how that provision has been interpreted earlier does not mean that the early tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers as argued by Applicant. The Committee will now turn to the grounds argued by Applicant in support of its contention that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n100.\n\nApplicant's first argument, as summarized above, is that Tribunal wrongly placed the burden of proof on Applicant instead of requiring Respondent to sustain its objection to jurisdiction on the basis that Article VII.2 of the BIT required prior recourse to the local courts. Applicant alleges that Respondent did not provide any evidence in support of its allegations and that the Tribunal should have dismissed the objection and exercised jurisdiction.\n\n101.\n\nThe Committee first notes that the Tribunal did not discuss any issue of burden of proof or any of the Parties discussed the burden of proof as regards the objection to jurisdiction. The Tribunal did not in any way make it known that its decision was based on lack of proof provided by Applicant. While it is generally correct that the defense of a claim would be the responsibility of the defendant, and not of claimant to provide evidence sustaining it, it is also true that Applicant had to prove that Respondent had consented to arbitration under Article VII.2. Furthermore, the Tribunal itself has to be satisfied of its own jurisdiction.\n\n102.\n\nThe controversy on this issue relates to the revised English translation of Article VII.2 of the BIT from the Russian authentic text of the BIT provided by Respondent to the Tribunal three days before the January hearing.70 Up to that moment, there had been no question as regards the English and Russian authentic versions of the BIT. Respondent ordered a new translation because, according to Counsel to Respondent, Russian speakers in the offices of Counsel noted that the existing English text did not convey accurately the meaning of the Russian text.\n\n*See* para. 29 *supra*.\n\n103.\n\nThe Interpretation Decision noted that Claimant did not object to the revised translation at the time it was introduced, \"[n]or did Claimant request the opportunity, or time, to provide a translation from another expert, or request the attendance of Respondent's translator at the hearing (or at a later date) for cross-examination.\"71 The Tribunal further noted that in the closing arguments at the January hearing Counsel to Respondent requested the Tribunal to appoint an expert if did not believe in the revised translation or thought insufficient the sworn statement of the translator. It is also noted by the Tribunal (i) that Counsel to Claimant emphasized that the difference between the Parties was not on the translation, but on the interpretation provided by Respondent, and (ii) that on Respondent's proposition that the Tribunal appoint a Russian language expert, Counsel to Claimant stated:\n\nI think that would be highly unusual. It would be a strange thing to do just in relation to the Russian text, and not the English text, and not the various Turkish texts. The Claimant has no desire to have further expenditures, and thinks it would be sufficient to have the pleadings of the parties on this point. And I say that, Mr. President, without having had any time to do more than to read the letter sent by the respondent. I've been out of the country and doing other things, so this is not an informed response.72\n\nThe Tribunal at this point offered Claimant to come back to the Tribunal on this matter and gave Claimant additional time to consider the matter.\n\nInterpretation Decision, para. 8.14.\n\n*Id*. para. 8.14.\n\n104.\n\nAfter the January hearing, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties that:\n\n[\u2026] having regard to: (a) the continuing uncertainty as to the accuracy of the translations into English of the Russian text of Article VII.2; and (b) the possible relevance of the translation into English of the Turkish version of Article VII.2 (as published in the Official Gazette), the Tribunal had decided to request two independent and qualified expert translators to provide it with English language translations of the relevant texts. The parties were provided with CVs for the proposed experts as well as the proposed instructions they were to receive. The Tribunal further advised that the parties would be given a reasonable opportunity to comment on such translation once they were in hand, and that the Tribunal would welcome comments, if any, on the Tribunal's intended instructions and on the choice of translators.73\n\n*Id*. para. 8.16.\n\n105.\n\nRespondent proposed to the Tribunal that the translator be asked: \"[d]oes the Russian phrase, ' *pri uslovii, esli'*, when used in a sentence create a double conditional or is it a construct that is used to create a single conditional the way either the words 'on the condition that', or the word 'if' create in the English language?\"74\n\n*Id*. para. 8.17.\n\n106.\n\nClaimant opposed the proposed retainer of a Russian expert translator by the Tribunal, and stated that, if the Tribunal insisted, then Respondent should pay for the exercise and objected to Respondent's request, indicating that\n\nthe Russian-English translator be asked not only to provide the translation of the text of Article 7(2) of the BIT but also give an opinion on, or make an interpretation in relation to, certain Russian words.75\n\nClaimant continued that \"[i]t is notable that the Respondent does not seek to pretend that what it is asking for is a translation. It goes without saying that opinions and interpretations are not translations. It would not be appropriate in relation to the stated objective of the Tribunal in this exercise for the Tribunal to accede to the Respondent's request.\"76\n\n*Id*. para. 8.14.\n\n*Id.* para. 8.19.\n\n107.\n\nThen the Tribunal advised the Parties that it would proceed to decide the BIT issues on the present record, but it reserved the right to instruct independent translators if necessary. The Tribunal did not instruct independent translators and concluded that\n\n[T]he accurate translation of the authentic Russian text of Article VII.2 of the BIT for present purposes (*i.e*, the one that conveys its true sense in Russian) is that set out in R-1 (revised). That is to say, a translation that has the word 'if' removed from the second line of sub-paragraph (c). In the view of the Tribunal, this more accurately conveys in the English language the sense of the Russian text.77\n\n*Id*. para. 8.22.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal was sensitive to the fact that the revised English translation of the Russian text was introduced three days before the January hearing. It recognized this fact and it equally recognized that\n\nRespondent offered a plausible explanation for the reasons and timing of the revision. Moreover, Claimant did not object at that time to its introduction. Nor did Claimant request the opportunity, or time, to provide a translation from another expert or request the attendance of Respondent's translator at the hearing (or at a later date) for cross-examination.78\n\n*Id*. para. 8.10.\n\n109.\n\nAs recorded in detail in the Interpretation Decision, the Tribunal received no evidence from Applicant on the meaning of Article VII.2. Claimant had the opportunity to object, to introduce new evidence, to come back to the Tribunal after the January hearing, or to have independent experts give their translation or interpretation, as Applicant calls it. Applicant could have also appointed its own expert.\n\n110.\n\nIn the view of the Committee the question is not an issue of the Tribunal's shifting the burden of proof to Applicant, but of the Tribunal giving Applicant the opportunity to respond to the new evidence before the Tribunal and how Applicant used this opportunity. The new evidence, i.e., the revised translation, put in question the understanding that, until then, the Parties had of the meaning of Article VII.2. Respondent introduced the revised English translation in support of its objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Applicant decided not to introduce further evidence in response. An annulment proceeding is not the appropriate venue for the losing party in ICSID arbitration to make up for failures of the strategy followed by counsel in the arbitration proceeding.\n\n111.\n\nThe second ground adduced by Applicant in support of the manifest excess of powers is the alleged failure of the Tribunal to rely on the plain reading of the English and Russian versions of the BIT to decide whether Article VII.2 provided for an optional recourse to local courts.\n\n112.\n\nApplicant contends that there is a plain meaning of Article VII.2; the meaning of the English and Russian authentic texts of the BIT, before the revised translation into English of the Russian version of Article VII.2 was submitted to the Tribunal on January 17, 2012. The non-Russian speaking Tribunal had before it a revised English translation of the authentic Russian text and the original English text. The Tribunal stated the following on the English text:\n\n[\u2026] the phrasing of the English is grammatically incorrect. Not only is it inelegant, as was conceded by Claimant, but the pertinent part of Article VII.2 contains a single word which does not immediately appear that it ought to be present, and would not be present if the text had been drafted by a native speaker. There are two different single words that might be removed: the word 'if' could be removed [\u2026] or the word 'and' could [be] removed [\u2026]. On either approach, the removal of one of those two words (but not both) would give the phrase grammatical coherence. An issue that arises is which, if any, of the two words might be removed.79 The Tribunal questioned a linguistics expert presented by Respondent. The Tribunal considered that the expert \"[\u2026] testified with considerable clarity and persuasiveness, that one would normally not expect two conditionals together ('provided that' followed by 'if'), which is the only way one gets to an 'optional' text. On the other hand, the conjunctive 'and' has no business in any text, unless the local court provision is mandatory.\"80\n\n*Id*. para. 9.14.\n\n*Id*. para. 9.15.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that \"attempting to interpret the relevant English text in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT leaves its meaning ambiguous or obscure.\"81 It is not for the Committee to reach its own conclusion on whether the text of Article VII.2 of the authentic English version of the BIT is ambiguous or obscure. The Tribunal explained that it had difficulty with the use of the double condition \"provided that, if\" and how to make sense of the subsequent sentence. For the Committee, what is relevant is that the Tribunal reached its conclusion after hearing the Parties, analyzing the text and questioning the translator. It cannot be said that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by not exercising its jurisdiction on the basis of the plain meaning of Article VII.2. According to the Tribunal, such plain meaning alleged by Applicant was not supported by the Tribunal's analysis of the text.\n\n*Id*. para. 9.17.\n\n114.\n\nIn its pleadings, Applicant refers to the Tribunal's email of dated March 6, 2012 whereby it reserved its right to instruct an independent expert. Applicant argues:\n\nIt should have done so once it decided to disregard the initially agreed translation that was [sic] conform moreover with the authentic English and Russian versions of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT. The Tribunal members did not speak Russian. To the extent that the Tribunal relied on the Russian version of the BIT to interpret Article VII.2, the interpretation should have been based on the translation by an independent expert, and not a revised interpretation of Respondent's hired gun.82\n\nMemorial, para. 212. Underlined text in the original.\n\n115.\n\nAs we have already seen, the Tribunal tried to hire an expert and Applicant opposed it on grounds of cost and because of the question added by Respondent on the Russian expression. The Tribunal at the time refrained from instructing an expert given the Parties' views and announced that it would decide on the record. The Parties were advised that the Tribunal would proceed without appointing an expert. Given the opposition of Applicant to the retention of an expert by the Tribunal during the arbitration proceeding, it is somewhat incongruous at this stage to argue that the Tribunal should have engaged such expert.\n\n116.\n\nThe third ground advanced by Applicant is the failure of the Tribunal to follow the lead of the *Rumeli* and *Sistem* tribunals in interpreting Article VII.2. While Applicant finds the *Rumeli* and *Sistem* awards persuasive, the Tribunal did not. The Tribunal had no obligation to follow the interpretation by other arbitral tribunals of BIT articles identical or similar to Article VII.2. The Tribunal considered both decisions and explained why it was not persuaded. In the case of the *Rumeli* award, the Tribunal explains that the *Rumeli* tribunal concluded that the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT did not require prior submission of the dispute to the local courts, but that tribunal reached this conclusion without analysis or reasoning in support. As a further reason, the Tribunal noted that, \"the tribunal's reasoning in that case seems to have disregarded the Turkish text, which in that case was authentic, and plainly imposed a mandatory requirement to have recourse to the local courts.\"83\n\nInterpretation Decision, para. 9.9.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal also considered the *Sistem* award. The Tribunal noted that the *Sistem* tribunal concluded that it took \"no position on the question because *Sistem* has not instituted any proceedings in the national courts against the Kyrgyz Republic.\"84 The Tribunal found it difficult to rely on this conclusion because\n\nIt appears from the account of the *Sistem* case that the respondent there did not raise the same argument as the Respondent in the present case. It appears from the award that the *Sistem* tribunal did not consider the question that is before this Tribunal and disposed of the matter on a different basis, having regard to the different arguments of the parties.85\n\nQuotation in para. 9.11 of the Interpretation Decision. The quotation is from para. 106 of the *Sistem* award, but the footnote to para. 9.11 of the Interpretation Decision refers the reader to footnote 21. This footnote is in reference to the *Sistem* decision on jurisdiction and not to the award (*Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v. Krygyz Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/06/1), Decision on Jurisdiction, September 13, 2007 (CLA-30).\n\nInterpretation Decision, para. 9.13.\n\n118.\n\nIn either case and irrespective of the merits of these reasons, they have to be considered in the context that the Tribunal had no obligation to adopt the views of the *Rumeli* and *Sistem* tribunals. A joint statement of the State parties to a treaty, as argued by Applicant, reflecting their understanding of controverted provisions may help arbitral tribunals to reach consistent decisions but states may choose not to issue such statement. To revise the interpretations and conclusions of tribunals in order to achieve uniformity of case law is not an objective within the limited terms of an annulment committee.\n\n119.\n\nThe fourth ground adduced by Applicant relates to the application of the VCLT to the interpretation of Article VII.2. The argument developed by Applicant has three angles: text of the BIT, supplementary means of interpretation and evidence presented by Applicant.\n\n120.\n\nAccording to Applicant, the task of the Tribunal was to understand the intent of the state parties to the BIT but, instead, the Tribunal disregarded Turkey's intention. In support, Applicant contends that the Tribunal did not follow each of the stages of interpretation required for a textual analysis of Article VII.2 under Article 31 of the VCLT. Applicant highlights two elements of the textual interpretation missing from the analysis of the Tribunal. First, Applicant points out that Article VII.1 is written in mandatory terms: the notification of a dispute shall be in writing and the concerned party shall endeavor to settle the dispute. On the other hand, Article VII.2 is drafted in permissive terms: if the dispute cannot be settled within six months: \"the dispute can be submitted, as the investor may choose, to [\u2026]\"\n\n121.\n\nSecondly, the other missing element is consideration of the contradiction within Article VII created by an interpretation requiring prior recourse to the local courts, because\n\nthe investor is allowed to submit the dispute to arbitration six months after notice of the dispute while the said investor would have to wait twelve more months to bring the dispute to arbitration. In other words, a mandatory consideration of the Treaty reads against this clear provision in that one-year referral (in which no final judgment is to be obtained) necessarily means that a dispute cannot be submitted to international arbitration within six months of presenting a notice of dispute.86\n\nMemorial, para. 246.\n\n122.\n\nThe analysis of the text by the Tribunal is focused on whether \"if\" or \"and\" should be deleted from the text. The sentence \"provided that, if \u2026\" is analyzed without reference to the rest of the paragraph or of Article VII. On this limited analysis the Tribunal concludes that the text is ambiguous. There is no analysis of the context or of the purpose of the BIT before the Tribunal reaches out to the supplementary means of interpretation.\n\n123.\n\nAmong the supplementary means of interpretation the Tribunal considered the circumstances of the conclusion of the BIT. The Tribunal observed that Turkey entered into four BITs with Turkic States in the course of five days, the authentic versions of which include substantially identical provisions as those found in Article VII.2. The Tribunal also refers to the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT signed the day before the BIT, which in its Turkish version requires mandatory recourse to the local courts. The Tribunal concludes that the better view is that the English language version of Article VII.2 is properly to be interpreted as requiring mandatory recourse to the local courts. This view best reconciles the interpretation of the texts, having regard to the circumstances surrounding their adoption. The contrary view does not appear to find support in other circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the BIT.87\n\nInterpretation Decision para. 9.21.\n\n124.\n\nApplicant argues that it provided the Tribunal evidence of the intention of Turkey when it signed the BIT while Respondent did not, and that the Tribunal disregarded Turkey's intent and interpretation. In the instant case, the Tribunal considered the statements of Mrs. Ozbilgi\u00e7 and Mr. Kasimcan and found them not to be dispositive or persuasive. In the case of Mrs. Ozbilgi\u00e7 because the difficulty with her statement, \"which limits its value, is that the certified English translation of the 'official' Turkish text [\u2026] does not contain the word 'if'\".88 According to the Tribunal, the same reason applies to the statement of Mr. Kasimcan. In a footnote the Tribunal explained that it rejected\n\nClaimant's argument that the 'official' Turkish version of the BIT was mistranslated. The Tribunal reaches this conclusion having regard to the mandatory Russian text of the BIT and because of the identity of the 'official' Turkish text with the authentic Turkish text in the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT.89\n\nThe statements of Mrs. \u00d4zbilgi\u00e7 and Mr. Kasimcan,90 relied on the text of the Submission Letter of the BIT to the Turkish parliament while the Tribunal relied on the text of the BIT as published in the Official Gazette. In a further footnote the Tribunal explained that,\n\n[it] does not disregard [\u2026] the Council of Ministers' letter to the Turkish Parliament, which described Article VII in terms which support the meaning of the relevant text as being optional. However, such a memorandum describing the draft Law on the Approbation of the Approval of the BIT is trumped by the subsequent publication in the Official Gazette of the 'official' Turkish translation of the authentic English version of the BIT in terms which are unquestionably mandatory.91\n\n*Id.* para. 9.7.\n\n*Id.* n. 41.\n\nMrs. \u00d4zbilgi\u00e7 and Mr. Kasimcan, officials of the Turkish government, submitted, on behalf of Claimant, an email and a letter respectively, during the course of the arbitration proceedings advocating for the optionality of Art. VII. 2. *See* Interpretation Decision, para. 3.20.\n\n*Id.* n. 48.\n\n125.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the Tribunal considered the evidence submitted by Applicant but for the reasons given was not convinced. The supplementary means of interpretation were properly used since it had reached the conclusion that the text was ambiguous. Nonetheless the Committee notes that the Tribunal reached the conclusion that the text is ambiguous without an express analysis of the context of Article VII.2 and of the object and purpose of the BIT as required by Art. 31 of the VCLT. From the Tribunal's Award it is not quite clear whether these steps were ignored, found to be irrelevant, or used but not mentioned before reaching out for the supplementary means of interpretation for the interpretation of Art. VII.2 of the BIT. What is clear is that the Tribunal generally took into account the relevant Articles of the VCLT: The Award expressly mentions Respondent's reasoning on the object and purpose of the BIT,92 expressly cites Arts. 31 and 32 VCLT with special references to the context and object and purpose93 and states that the Majority finds Prof. Park's reasoning based on the \"key purposes of the BIT\" not persuasive.94 Even though one might consider that these references could have been reiterated in further detail before interpreting Article VII.2 as ambiguous, the Committee finds that the Tribunal's use of the supplementary means of interpretation is at least plausible if one considers the full context of the Award.\n\n*See* Award, paras. 3.3.54 -3.3.56.\n\n*Id.* paras. 5.2.1-5.2.6.\n\n*Id.* para. 6.5.4.\n\n126.\n\nUnder the fifth ground, Applicant argues that Turkey's own practice confirms Turkey's intent that recourse to the local judiciary is optional. Applicant grounds its argument on an extensive review of the practice of Turkey as signatory of 85 BITs. There is no record that such practice was presented by Applicant to the Tribunal. It may have been helpful to that Tribunal, but this proceeding is not the venue to re-argue the case with new arguments and evidence that was not before the Tribunal.\n\n127.\n\nThe sixth ground advanced by Applicant is that mandatory recourse to the local judiciary would violate the object and purpose of the BIT and lead to an absurd result. Applicant is concerned that, if the local courts would decide on the investor's claim before one year, the investor would lose the protection afforded by the BIT safe for an action for denial of justice. As a general matter, it is arguable that optional recourse to local courts may be considered as more fitting with the purpose of the BIT, but mandatory prior recourse to the local courts is not per se absurd or contrary to the BIT's purpose, even if it limits the grounds on which an investor could pursue its claims in arbitration if the courts decide within a year.\n\n128.\n\nThe seventh ground aggregates four arguments that, except for the argument related to the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT, the Committee has already considered as part of the six other grounds for manifest excess of powers. The Committee will consider the argument in respect of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT as part of the next section. As regards the other grounds and for the reasons explained above, the Committee reaches the conclusion that Applicant has not proven that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\nB. *Failure to State Reasons*\n-----------------------------\n\n*a)*  *Summary of the Positions of the Parties*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nApplicant claims that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in the following thirteen instances because it failed:\n\n(i) to explain the question of the burden of proof, the rules on evidence or the rules of interpretation that followed,\n\n(ii) to balance the probative value of the evidence on the record,\n\n(iii) to explain why it relied on the revised English translation of the Russian authentic version of the BIT,\n\n(iv) to explain why it relied on a linguistic expert to interpret a legal text,\n\n(v) to explain why it consider as interpretation the evidence provided by the Turkish State whereas this was evidence of the intention of the drafter,\n\n(vi) to explain why it relied on the Turkish authentic version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT when no signed or authentic version was on the record,\n\n(vii) to explain why it relied on the Turkish authentic version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT and it refused to rely on the English and Russian authentic versions of that BIT,\n\n(viii) to explain why it relied on the Turkish version of the BIT when it ruled that only English and Russian authentic versions existed,\n\n(ix) to explain why it relied on the Turkish version of the BIT published in the Official Gazette and the Turkish version of the Kazakh-Turkey BIT and not on the Turkish authentic version of the Turkey-Latvia BIT,\n\n(x) to explain the contradiction between its statement at paragraph 9.23 of the Decision that the Russian authentic version of the BIT is \"*clearly mandatory*\" with respect to the recourse to the local judiciary and the efforts and acrobatics it and Respondent had to undertake to reach this holding via moreover a revised opinion/translation and/or its general holding at paragraph 9.2.6 of the Award that the \"*meaning of that requirement was mostly not clear,*\"95\n\n(xi) to explain why it expected the arbitral tribunal in *Rumeli* to state reasons for the dismissal of a similar jurisdictional objection,\n\n(xii) to explain why the Tribunal expected Kyrgyzstan to raise the same argument as Turkmenistan for the *Sistem* decision to be given probative value, and\n\n(xiii) to explain \"the practical considerations of its findings and what would have been the scope of substantive protection that Claimant would be entitled to should its recourse to the local judiciary lead to an adverse award within one year.\"96\n\nMemorial, para. 306.10. Emphasis in the original footnotes omitted.\n\n*Id.* para. 306.13.\n\n130.\n\nAccording to Applicant, each one of these acts and omissions of the Tribunal constitutes a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n131.\n\nRespondent replies: \"[t]he Tribunal explained why it found that Article VII.2 provided for mandatory recourse to local courts, on both a legal and factual basis. The Tribunal explained how it determined the number of authentic versions of the BIT, how it interpreted Article VII.2 in accordance with the Vienna Convention and in particular (i) how it interpreted the authentic Russian version of the BIT as providing for mandatory recourse to local courts, (ii) why it concluded that the authentic English version was ambiguous, (iii) and in light of this ambiguity, how it had recourse to supplemental means of interpretation to elucidate the meaning of the authentic English version of the BIT and concluded that Article VII.2 requires mandatory recourse to local courts as a precondition to commencing an arbitration.\"97\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 190.\n\n132.\n\nRespondent addresses each one of Applicant's allegations. According to Respondent, the Tribunal (i) explained the rules on interpretation that followed, (ii) considered all the evidence on the record, (iii) provided ample reasons why it found that the accurate translation into English of the authentic Russian version of Article VII.2 was Respondent's revised translation, (iv) explained how Respondent's linguistic expert's report confirmed the Tribunal's conclusion that the authentic English version of Article VII.2 of the BIT is ambiguous, (v) explained why the evidence of Turkey's unilateral intent did not help interpreting Article VII.2, (vi) explained that it relied on the Turkish version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT as a supplemental means of interpretation under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, (vii) explained why it relied on the authentic Turkish version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT, (viii) explained that it relied on the Turkish version of the BIT as a supplemental means of interpretation under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, (ix) explained why it relied on the official Turkish text of the BIT as published in the Official Gazette and the Turkish version of the Kazakh-Turkey BIT, (x) amply explained why it found the local court requirement as \"clearly mandatory\" in the authentic Russian version of Article VII.2, (xi) explained why it did not find the *Rumeli* award convincing, (xii) explained why it did not find the *Sistem* award convincing, and (xiii) was not called upon to decide on the scope of substantive protection that Claimant would be entitled to in case of an adverse judgment of the local courts within one year.\n\n*b)*  *Analysis of the Committee*\n---------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nAt the outset, the Committee notes that arbitral tribunals have no obligation to expressly address, in their awards, every single issue and argument raised by the parties. Tribunals have discretion to focus on those issues and arguments that they find determinative for their decision and not to address in their awards arguments of the parties that they find to be irrelevant. Even more so, making use of that discretion is not by itself a reason for nullification under Article 52.1(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n134.\n\nNevertheless, the Committee will take one by one the arguments of Applicant in support of its claim that the Tribunal failed to state reasons; in so doing the Committee is mindful that it is not its mandate to review the quality or sufficiency of the reasons as it has already noted earlier in this decision.\n\n135.\n\nThe first argument in support of failure to state reasons is related to the burden of proof and the rules of evidence or interpretation followed by the Tribunal. As regards the burden of proof, the Committee has already found that Applicant's argument is misplaced and not supported by what the Tribunal did. The Tribunal gave an opportunity to present evidence in response to the new evidence introduced by Respondent three days before the January hearing. Applicant did not present its own evidence to rebut Respondent's evidence and it did not object to the introduction of Respondent's evidence at the time.\n\n136.\n\nAs to the rules of interpretation, the Tribunal relied on Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT as explained it in its Interpretation Decision: \"[i]n the event, the Tribunal concludes that attempting to interpret the relevant English text in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT leaves its meaning ambiguous or obscure. In these circumstances, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to consider supplementary means of interpretation as permitted under Article 32 of the VCLT.\"98 Then the Tribunal considers the circumstances of the conclusion of the BIT as supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the VCLT.\n\nInterpretation Decision, para. 9.17.\n\n137.\n\nIt is correct, as argued by Applicant, that the Tribunal did not expressly consider the context of Article VII.2 or the object and purpose of the BIT in its analysis of Article VII.2 under Article 31 of the VCLT. The Tribunal reached the conclusion on the obscurity or ambiguity of the text of this article without following each of the steps to interpret a treaty under Article 31 of the VCLT. From that conclusion the Tribunal passed on to the supplementary means of interpretation. Article 32 provides that recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, \"including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31: (a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or [\u2026].\" The Tribunal acted consequently to its conclusion on the obscurity of the text. With regard to how the Tribunal reached the conclusion on the ambiguity of the text, the Committee already concluded that the Tribunal's reasoning can be at least considered plausible though more detail might have made that reasoning clearer. Tribunals have a considerable discretion in how much detail they present at every single step of their legal reasoning in their awards.\n\n138.\n\nApplicant questions the selection by the Tribunal, without giving reasons, of the translation of the Russian version of the BIT as revised by Respondent. The Tribunal explained the selection on the basis that it found it to be the accurate English translation. Applicant also questions the reliance of the Tribunal on the Turkish text of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT. The Tribunal explained that, under Article 32 of the VCLT, it relied on BITs concluded around the date of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT. The Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT was concluded a day before the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT.\n\n139.\n\nApplicant also states that the Tribunal failed to give reasons for the rules of evidence that it followed. As a general matter, under the ICSID Arbitration Rules tribunals have ample discretion in the appreciation of the evidence furnished by the parties. In particular, Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to explain why the probative value of the BIT Submission Letter was lower than that of the non-authentic and mistranslated version of the BIT. The Tribunal relied on a text published in the Official Gazette of Turkey; unless corrected this would be the law of the country as against an explanatory document to the parliamentarians. The Tribunal cannot be blamed for paying due attention to a text that by definition is the law of Turkey.\n\n140.\n\nApplicant also criticizes the Tribunal for not giving reasons for the weight given to the Turkish text of the BIT published in the Official Gazette when it had found that the English and Russian versions were the authentic versions of the BIT. The Tribunal had recourse to the Turkish text after it found the English text obscure. The text published in the Official Gazette is the law of Turkey; it needs no further explanation tha *t* the text of a published law carries considerable weight.\n\n141.\n\nApplicant is particularly critical of the use by the Tribunal of the Turkish version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT when no authentic or signed version was on the record and disregarded the authentic Turkish version of the Turkey-Latvia BIT, which clearly provided optional prior recourse to the local courts. Applicant notes that the Tribunal reflected this argument of Applicant in the Decision and it had been discussed at the January hearing, but \"the Tribunal failed to discuss this argument *at all* in its legal analysis, and therefore did not state the reasons why it apparently dismissed the Turkey-Latvia BIT.\"99\n\nReply, para. 214.9. Emphasis in the original.\n\n142.\n\nUnder the \"Claimant's Case\" the Tribunal described the argument of Applicant in the context of the discussion on the accurate translation into English of authentic versions of the BIT. The description of the Tribunal is as follows:\n\nClaimant points to the fact that, although the English language versions of Article VII.2 in the two treaties are identical, the authentic Turkish language version of the Turkey-Latvia BIT states clearly that an investor has an option or discretionary power to bring a dispute to the courts of the host state.\n\nClaimant maintains that because the Turkish version of the relevant provision of this treaty is authentic, this shows that a translation mistake was made when the same authentic English language version of Article VII.2 of the BIT was translated into Turkish for publication in the Official Gazette.100\n\nInterpretation Decision, paras. 3.16-3.17.\n\n143.\n\nNotwithstanding recording Applicant's argument and the discussion at the January hearing, the Tribunal did not address the argument of Applicant in its reasoning. On the other hand, the Tribunal explained why it considered the Kazakhstan BIT and the other BITs with Turkic states. The Tribunal was concerned with the circumstances of the conclusion of the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT and noted: \"[t]he closest thing to a Turkish version of the BIT that seems, on the evidence before us, to have existed at the time is the Turkish version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT that was signed on 1 May 1992.\"101 As indicated during the arbitration hearing, the Latvia BIT was entered a few years later in 1997 and was only published in 1999. The concentration of the attention of the Tribunal on Turkey's BITs with Turkic states is consistent with the reliance of the Tribunal on the terms of Article 32 of the VCLT. The Tribunal explained its focus on the treaties concluded contemporaneously with the Turkey-Turkmenistan BIT, it did not need to give reasons why it did not consider others.\n\n*Id*. n. 36.\n\n144.\n\nA constant thread in Applicant's arguments is that the revised English version of Article VII.2 is an interpretation of the Russian text rather than a translation. The so-called interpretation was explained to the Tribunal at the January hearing. The Tribunal relied on the explanations of the linguistic expert. The Tribunal was non-Russian speaking; it had two versions of the English text. The Tribunal decided in favor of the revised English version, which the Tribunal found to be the accurate version. The Tribunal had proposed to the Parties to engage an expert. Applicant did not agree on the terms of reference. While the Tribunal retained its right to appoint an expert, it never promised that it would appoint one. The Tribunal was very clear that it would decide on the record as it stood. The Tribunal did not need to explain further why it did not retain an expert itself.\n\n145.\n\nAs regards the *Rumeli* award, Applicant argues that, \"the Tribunal failed to state the reasons why it imposed a certain persuasiveness test requiring a particular reasoning from the *Rumeli* tribunal.\"102 As the Committee reads the Decision, the Tribunal simply stated that it was not persuaded because the *Rumeli* tribunal did not provide an analysis or reasoning to support its conclusion. The Committee believes it is timely to repeat that the Tribunal had no obligation to follow the *Rumeli* tribunal interpretation of an article equivalent to Article VII.2. At best arbitral tribunals may be guided by or find persuasive the decisions of other tribunals; they may also ignore them. In the instant case, the Tribunal considered the award, was unconvinced and stated why.\n\nReply, para. 214.11.\n\n146.\n\nApplicant raises the same issue in respect of the *Sistem* award. To avoid repetition, the Committee refers *mutatis mutandis* to its comments in the previous paragraph.\n\n147.\n\nThe last ground argued by Applicant to state that the Tribunal failed to state reasons is related to the effect of the interpretation of the Tribunal and will be more appropriately addressed later in this decision. As regards the other arguments for failure to state reasons, Applicant has failed to convince the Committee of their merit.\n\nC. *Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*a)*  *Summary of the Positions of the Parties*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nApplicant argues that the Tribunal disregarded the rules on the burden of proof by failing to place the burden on Respondent; the improper reversal of the burden of proof is an abuse of the Tribunal's discretion to form its own view on the relevance and weight to be accorded to the evidence. In addition, Applicant adduces the following as grounds for annulment under this heading (i) the de facto delegation to interpret the BIT text in dispute to a translator, (ii) that the Tribunal based its ruling on an unsigned document or unproven to be the authentic Turkish version of the BIT, (iii) that the Tribunal did not treat the Parties equally, and (iv) that the Tribunal relied on the Turkish authentic version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT and refused to rely on its English and Russian authentic versions.\n\n149.\n\nIt is Applicant's contention that each of these acts or omissions constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n150.\n\nRespondent affirms that the burden of proof lies with Claimant to demonstrate that the Tribunal has jurisdiction, and explains that\n\n[w]hile it is true that Respondent is the applicant with respect to the objection to jurisdiction at issue, it is also true that it is Claimant who bears the burden of establishing Turkmenistan's consent to arbitration. The question of whether or not Article VII.2 requires that the dispute be submitted to local courts as a precondition to the host State's consent is dispositive of the existence of Turkmenistan's consent to arbitrate the present case.\"103\n\nRespondent adds that, in any event, the Tribunal did not rule on the interpretation and meaning of Article VII.2 of the BIT on the ground that Kili\u00e7 did not meet its burden of proof.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 178.\n\n151.\n\nAs regards Applicant's arguments on the Tribunal's delegation of the mission to interpret Article VII.2 of the BIT to a translator and the Tribunal's reliance on the Turkish version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT, Respondent affirms that it is another attempt to obtain a review by the Committee of the evidence submitted in the arbitration. Respondent recalls the arguments made in response in the discussion on the manifest excess of powers.\n\n152.\n\nThen Respondent addresses Applicant's argument that the Tribunal treated the Parties unequally in its treatment and assessment of the evidence. This argument is related to the Tribunal's reliance on the Turkish version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT. According to Respondent \"the Tribunal carefully reviewed and weighed all of the evidence submitted by both Parties and concluded that Article VII.2 provides for mandatory recourse to local courts. In doing so, the Tribunal did not depart from any rule of procedure.\"104\n\n*Id.* para. 188.\n\n*b)*  *Analysis of the Committee*\n---------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Committee recalls what it has said under previous sections on the question of the shifting of the burden of proof. The argument of Applicant is based on Applicant's belief that Respondent did not prove that the State parties to the BIT had the intention to introduce a mandatory recourse to the local courts. The Tribunal evaluated the evidence that was presented by the Parties and decided otherwise. The decision of the Tribunal is not based, as Applicant's argument would seem to imply, on Applicant's failure to discharge its burden of proof. Respondent introduced new evidence and the Tribunal gave an opportunity to Applicant to respond. This is part of the equal treatment of the Parties in a judicial procedure. How or why Applicant took or did not take advantage of this opportunity is a matter for Applicant itself to judge.\n\n154.\n\nApplicant contends that the Tribunal based its ruling on \"an unsigned document and/or unproven to be the authentic Turkish version.\"105 The Committee will not second-guess the Tribunal's appreciation of the evidence on which it relied. It will simply observe that the \"ruling\" of the Tribunal was not only based on the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT. The Tribunal relied on other BITs \"in addition\" to the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT.\n\nMemorial, para. 316.\n\n155.\n\nApplicant further complains of unequal treatment by the Tribunal because it \"relied on the [alleged] Turkish authentic version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT whereas it refused to rely on the English and Russian authentic versions thereof (which were identical to the English and Russian authentic versions of the BIT) including for the purposes of translating into English the Russian authentic version of the BIT [\u2026].\"106 The English and Russian authentic versions of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT were identical to the authentic English and Russian versions of the BIT, hence the reasons for not relying on the English version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan BIT would be the same as explained by the Tribunal for not relying on the authentic English version of the BIT. In this context it is understandable that the Tribunal would look into the Turkish version of the Turkey-Kazakhstan-BIT that the Tribunal considered authentic and that contained substantially identical terms to those of the BIT as published in the Official Gazette. The Tribunal went on to note: \"[t]he Turkish legal experts for both parties agree on this point.\"107\n\n*Id.* para. 319.\n\nInterpretation Decision, para. 9.19, n. 47.\n\n156.\n\nIn the view of the Committee the Tribunal did not \"refuse\" to rely on any particular version of the various treaties before it. The Tribunal considered them and for the reasons that the Tribunal explained it found a particular version more convincing. The fact that it did not find convincing the arguments of Applicant is not a basis for a claim of unequal treatment in the appreciation of evidence.\n\n157.\n\nApplicant has also argued under this heading that it delegated the interpretation of the BIT to a translator. In the view of the Committee, a translation of a document is not a delegation to interpret the document. A translation has to make sense in the language that it is translated into, whether the translation is literal or liberal. The consideration of this issue by the Tribunal cannot be isolated of what else the Tribunal did to ascertain the meaning of the text and that the Committee has by now repeated a number of times in this decision.\n\n158.\n\nIn sum, for the above reasons the Committee is unable to conclude that the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n*1. THE EFFECT OF ARTICLE VII.2 AS INTERPRETED BY THE TRIBUNAL*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA, *Manifest Excess of Powers*\n------------------------------\n\n*a)*  *Summary of the Positions of the Parties*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nApplicant contends that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by disregarding or grossly misapplying the BIT and the Vienna Convention, by grossly misapplying or failing to set the standard to excuse Claimant from recourse to local courts, and by *de facto* imposing a recourse to local courts in order to test the futility test and thus not allowing derogation from the mandatory recourse as it exists under international law.\n\n160.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal's finding that Article VII.2 provides for mandatory recourse to the local courts as a precondition to jurisdiction cannot constitute an egregious error when other tribunals before and after the Award have found that similar provisions requiring mandatory recourse to local courts constituted preconditions to jurisdiction, as opposed to admissibility.\n\n*b)*  *Analysis of the Committee*\n---------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nApplicant by and large repeats the arguments presented under the chapter on *The Meaning of Article VII.2*. Applicant explains that it is\n\nnot challenging for annulment purposes the Tribunal's conclusion that the requirements set forth in a dispute settlement clause form part of the State's consent to arbitration. Claimant, however, challenges the Tribunal's specific finding that Article VII.2 of the BIT contains a mandatory recourse to local courts that is a precondition to its jurisdiction for the simple reason that there is no requirement of mandatory recourse to local courts [\u2026]\"108\n\nHere Applicant remits to its arguments on the meaning of Article VII.2. The Committee will address these arguments to the extent that they refer to the application of the VCLT in the context of the effect of the interpretation of Article VII.2.\n\nMemorial, para. 327.\n\n162.\n\nIn the Award the Tribunal sets the stage for the application of Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT by referring to the principles of interpretation enumerated in the comments of the ILC on the Final Draft of the Convention of 1966. The Tribunal states:\n\nArticle 31(1) envisages the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of a treaty in their context. Treaty terms are obviously not drafted in isolation, and their meaning can only be determined by considering the entire text. The context will include the remaining terms of the sentence and of the paragraph; the entire article at issue; and the remainder of the treaty. *i.e*., its text including its preamble and annexes and the other means mentioned in Articles 31(2) and 31(3).109\n\nAward, para. 5.2.6.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal reasons:\n\nIt is a fundamental principle that an agreement is formed by offer and acceptance. But for an agreement to result, there must be acceptance of the offer *as made*. It follows that an arbitration agreement, such as would provide for the Centre to have jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, can only come into existence through a qualifying investor's acceptance of a host state's standing offer as made [\u2026]\"110\n\nThen the Tribunal states that \"in order for the necessary consent/agreement in writing to result, the offer must have been accepted on the basis of, and having regard to, the conditions explicitly set out in the BIT.\"111 The Tribunal concludes: \"the requirements set forth in Article VII.2 are to be treated as conditions, and that the failure to meet those conditions goes to the existence of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, and are not to be treated as issues of admissibility.\"112 Having found that the conditions for jurisdiction have not been met, the Tribunal concludes that it has no jurisdiction to suspend the proceedings.\n\n*Id*. para. 6.2.1. Emphasis in the original.\n\n*Id*. para. 6.3.14.\n\n*Id*. para. 6.3.15.\n\n164.\n\nApplicant's substantive argument is that the result of the interpretation defeats the crucial component of an effective treaty protection, namely, access to a fair and efficient means of settlement. Applicant is concerned that if a final decision from a local court is issued within one year, then the investor is barred from bringing a claim to arbitration unless it can show denial of justice. Applicant's criticism is based on arbitrator Park's separate opinion: \"[i]f the investor in the current proceedings files a second arbitration following a swift judgment denying treaty rights, the claim can be heard only if a new tribunal treats the proviso as something other than the *ab initio* jurisdictional precondition asserted in the Award.\"113\n\nSeparate Opinion, para. 22.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal addressed the issue raised in Arbitrator Park's opinion as follows:\n\nJust as a requirement to exhaust local remedies may be disregarded when it can be shown that no remedy is available, or an attempt at exhaustion would be futile, an ICSID tribunal that was presented with evidence that a respondent's domestic court had decided unfairly against a claimant investor, albeit within one year, could nevertheless exercise jurisdiction assuming that the other conditions had been met. In other words, the mere fact that domestic proceedings had been initiated, and they had been unfairly concluded within a year, would not of itself be a bar to jurisdiction.114\n\nAward, para. 6.5.4.\n\n166.\n\nIrrespective of the merits of the reasoning of the Majority of the Tribunal, this is a matter that would be decided by another tribunal unbound by findings of the Tribunal. For the Committee, the determinant factor is that the Tribunal had considered the conditions as conditions precedent to consent to jurisdiction and consequently it decided that it had no jurisdiction to suspend the proceeding. Faced with the same question, other tribunals have decided differently on questions of jurisdiction and admissibility; it is not for the Committee to favor one or the other of these positions.\n\n167.\n\nApplicant questions the futility standard chosen by the Tribunal and how the Tribunal applied it. Applicant refers to the following statement of the Tribunal:\n\nArticle VII.2 of the BIT does not require the exhaustion of local remedies as the concept is understood under international law. It simply requires an investor with a dispute to take the matter to the host state's courts and not have received a final award within one year.115\n\nThis notwithstanding, according to Applicant, the Tribunal applied the same standard as if the local remedies rule would apply. Applicant contends that, on the basis of *Daimler* and *Ambiente Ufficio,* the test should be lower: \"the Tribunal should have checked whether (i) recourse to a local court was available, and (ii) the investor was not prevented from complying with the requirement to go before the local courts.\"116\n\nAward, para. 8.1.7.\n\nMemorial, para. 347.\n\n168.\n\nIt is not evident, and Applicant does not explain it, in what way the standard set by *Daimler* is lower. The *Daimler* tribunal stated \"the Claimant has not asserted that it lacked a cause of action before the Argentine courts or that it was in some other way prevented from complying with the requirements of Article 10(2).\"117 The *Ambiente Ufficio* tribunal is more explicit: \"the threshold to be met for the futility exception to be realized in the present case cannot possibly be considered higher than in the context of diplomatic protection; on the contrary, it is arguably rather lower.\"118\n\n*Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1), Award, August 22, 2012 (CLA-173), para. 191, quoted in Memorial, para. 347.\n\n*Ambiente Ufficio S.p.A. and others v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/9), Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, February 8, 2013 (CLA-171), para. 602, quoted in Memorial, para. 344. Underlining in the original.\n\n169.\n\nThe Committee first observes that the Tribunal did not affirm that the threshold must be lower, but \"arguably\" lower, a qualified affirmation. Secondly and more importantly, Applicant did not argue in the underlying arbitration whether the standard to apply should be lower because recourse to the local courts under Article VII.2 of the BIT was analogous but not identical to an obligation to exhaust remedies under international law. Rather, Applicant argued in its counter-memorial in the arbitration proceeding that the rule of exhaustion of local remedies was a flexible rule. Applicant did not establish a difference between the standard to apply in the case of the requirements of Article VII.2 as opposed to the applicable standard under the exhaustion of local remedies rule. Applicant left it in the hands of the Tribunal: \"[i]t is the prerogative of the international tribunal before which the issue is raised to determine whether local remedies worth exhausting are indeed available and effective, rather than merely theoretical or illusory.\"119 This is what the Tribunal did.\n\nReply, n. 434, referring to Claimant's Counter-Memorial, para. 35 (CLA-18)\n\n170.\n\nThirdly, the Tribunal had no obligation to follow the precedents advocated by Applicant because they had not been brought to the attention of the Tribunal and because of the nonapplicability of the *stare deci* sis doctrine in international arbitration.\n\n171.\n\nAs regards the application of the standard, Applicant claims that the Tribunal failed to apply it or applied it in a manner that rendered moot any possible derogation of the mandatory recourse to the judiciary. Here the arguments of Applicant relate to the appreciation by the Tribunal of the evidence submitted by Applicant. The Tribunal reviewed it and found that \"Claimant has tendered no evidence - whether in the form of a witness or expertise - to support its assertion. Nor has Claimant sought to offer any explanation or account as to its failure to tender such evidence.\"120 The Tribunal commented further:\n\nClaimant's futility analysis is based principally on broad statements and third party studies/reports, to the effect that the Turkmen judiciary lacks independence, and that the Turkmen authorities would have had a particular aversion to Turkish investors. The Tribunal considers, however, that if a party to proceedings such as these is to make a futility argument, it has the onus of showing that recourse to the Contracting State's courts would be futile or ineffective, and that requires the tendering of probative evidence that goes to the specificity of the issue in dispute. It is not enough to make generalized allegations about the insufficiency of a state's legal system. Against the backdrop of relevant Turkmen laws introduced into the record by Respondent, such material as has been relied upon by Claimant cannot constitute sufficient evidence of unavailability or ineffectiveness.121\n\nAward, para. 8.1.5.\n\n*Id*. para. 8.1.10.\n\n172.\n\nThe appreciation of evidence is the prerogative of the Tribunal and it is not the Committee's mandate to re-appraise it. The Committee will return to Applicant's argument below when considering Applicant's claim of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n173.\n\nGiven the flexibility argued by Applicant itself, and the implicit discretion of the Tribunal in setting the threshold, the Committee finds that Applicant has failed to show how the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in setting the threshold or in applying it.\n\nB. *Failure to State Reasons*\n-----------------------------\n\n*a)*  *Summary of the Positions of the Parties*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nApplicant contends that the Tribunal failed to explain the following: (i) \"how and why Article VII.2 of the BIT did not bar substantive claims under the BIT in case of unfair judgment within a year nor to identify the scope of the substantive protections and underlying reasons,\"122 (ii) why it applied the futility standard of the exhaustion of local remedies, (iii) how a judge in Turkmenistan could decide a complex case within one year while ensuring the minimum required quality and due process safeguards, (iv) \"why the impossibility to find Turkmen lawyers willing to testify and represent a foreign investor against the State was not compelling evidence,\"123 (v) \"why the reports issued by reputable independent international institutions flagging the lack of independence, ethics and qualifications of the Turkmen judiciary did not constitute compelling evidence,\"124 (vi) why the anti-Turkish declaration of the President of Respondent did not constitute compelling evidence, (vii) what standard or what constituted compelling evidence for an investor to be excused from the recourse to the judiciary.\n\nMemorial, para. 373.\n\n*Id.* para. 376.\n\n*Id*. para. 377.\n\n175.\n\nRespondent contends that the Tribunal provided ample reasons for its decision: (i) pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention for a tribunal to have jurisdiction there need be a written agreement to arbitrate between the host state and the foreign investor, (ii) for an agreement there is the need of an offer and an acceptance of the offer, (iii) Article 26 of the ICSID Convention permits a State to require prior exhaustion of judicial remedies, (iv) Article VII.2 of the BIT provides for a sequence of separate resolution procedures through which a dispute will escalate, if not resolved in the former step, (v) such a multi-layered dispute resolution system is in accordance with the ICSID Convention, (vi) \"the adoption of language which requires that a series of steps 'shall' be taken, and which provide for a right to arbitrate 'provided that' another step has been taken, is \"an obvious construction of a condition precedent,\"125 and (vii) the failure to meet the conditions means that jurisdiction cannot be exercised. According to Respondent, this line of reasoning fully enables the reader to follow the Tribunal from point A to point B.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 236, sixth bullet.\n\n*b)*  *Analysis of the Committee*\n---------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe Committee has already dealt with the question of why Article VII.2 did not bar substantive claims under the BIT in case of an unfair judgment by the Turkmen courts. Applicant questions why the Tribunal applied the futility standard of the exhaustion of local remedies while it recognized that there was no exhaustion of local remedies required. This question has just been addressed and the reason should be obvious to Applicant: in the pleadings before the Tribunal, Applicant argued that the situation before the Tribunal was \"analogous\" to a situation where the local remedies rule applies.\n\n177.\n\nApplicant further questions, how it could be possible for a Turkmen judge to settle a dispute involving the construction of a major public utility project across the nation with different public entities involved and several hundred million USD at stake, that gives rise to complex factual, legal and quantification issues by way of a final award or decision within one year while ensuring the minimum required quality and due process safeguards.126\n\nApplicant is concerned here about the integrity of proceedings rushed to completion within a year in order for Respondent to avoid arbitration. This concern may be understandable, but this matter was not raised before the Tribunal. The Tribunal did not need to raise it *motu proprio*.\n\nMemorial, para. 375.\n\n178.\n\nApplicant also questions why the Tribunal found not compelling the evidence presented by Applicant. Among other reasons the Tribunal explained that, \"Claimant has tendered no evidence - whether in the form of a witness or expertise - to support its assertion. Nor has Claimant sought to offer any explanation or account as to its failure to tender such evidence.\"127 For the Committee it is clear that, for the Tribunal, compelling evidence is \"probative evidence that goes to the specificity of the issue in dispute,\"128 i.e., specific witness or expertise evidence, rather than general statements or reports.\n\nAward, para. 8.1.5.\n\n*Id*. 8.1.10.\n\n179.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the Tribunal provided reasons and Applicant's argument in this respect fails.\n\nC. *Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*a)*  *Summary of the Positions of the Parties*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nApplicant argues that the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure when \"de facto imposed a test or means of evidence that could not have been met other than by recourse to the local courts to assess the futility test or the standard that needs to be met to be excused from the local recourse requirement.\"129 In addition, the Tribunal refused to shift the burden of proof on Turkmenistan on the question of futility and derogation from the mandatory recourse to the local judiciary requirement once it was confronted with international reports relied upon by Claimant on the Turkmen judiciary's shortcomings, the statements of its President against Turkish investors, the taking of Claimant's assets, and the impossibility to access local attorneys.130\n\nMemorial, para. 381.\n\n*Id.* para. 382.\n\n181.\n\nRespondent notes that, apart from the issues related to burden of proof and unequal treatment of the Parties, Applicant does not point to other specific rules of procedure that the Tribunal allegedly violated. Respondent refers to the arguments already made earlier in this respect.\n\n*b)*  *Analysis of the Committee*\n---------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nApplicant disputes again the allocation of the burden of proof by the Tribunal. The starting point for the Tribunal was that the party who claimed futility of the recourse to the local courts had to prove such futility. The Tribunal, for the reasons already discussed under the claim of failure to provide reasons, considered insufficient the evidence presented by Applicant, as opposed to the evidence provided by Respondent. The Tribunal explained the type of evidence that was missing to support Applicant's claim: \"Claimant has tendered no evidence - whether in the form of a witness or expertise - to support its assertion. Nor has Claimant sought to offer any explanation or account as to its failure to tender such evidence.\"131\n\nAward, para. 8.1.5.\n\n183.\n\nIt is not a question of reversing the burden of proof but of whether the evidence presented by Applicant in the arbitration proceeding was sufficient. The Tribunal considered that evidence and found it insufficient to prove the futility of recourse to the local courts as against the test set by the Tribunal. Thus the Tribunal dismissed the cases of Mr. Arslan and Mr. Bozbey adduced by Applicant in support of the futility argument because it did not consider their subject matter relevant.132 In the first case because \"to the Tribunal's mind, Mr. Arslan's evidence was not directed to the availability and efficacy of the Turkmen judicial system to handle investor-state disputes.\"133 As to Mr. Bozbey's evidence, a criminal case, the Tribunal considered it not to be on point. The Tribunal noted that there was no suggestion that Mr. Bozbey had any relationship with Kili\u00e7 and added: \"It is thus difficult to see how his [Mr. Bozbey's] complaints, even if justified, are relevant to Kili\u00e7's complaints about the unavailability of or futility in having recourse to Respondent's courts over its BIT claims.\"134 The Tribunal also noted that the case of Applicant was not helped in Mr. Bozbey's case by the UN Human Rights Committee's finding that his claims were not substantiated.\n\n*See* Id. para. 8.1.16. Mr. Osman Arslan, one of Kili\u00e7's project manager, submitted a witness statement in the arbitration on the question of Turkmenistan's alleged animosity against those adverse to the government. Claimant also relied in reports by the UN Human Rights Committee relating to a complaint by Mr. Omar Faruk Bozbey, a Turkish investor in Turkmenistan. *See* Award paras. 4.3.10-4.3.11.\n\nAward para. 8.1.16.\n\n*Id*. para. 8.1.19.\n\n184.\n\nApplicant has raised as a separate question whether the Tribunal treated the Parties in the proceeding equally, in particular whether it had imposed a test that Applicant could not meet because, as the Tribunal admitted, there had been no previous cases of a similar nature before the Arbitrazh Court, in Turkmenistan.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal recognized:\n\nRespondent has not lead evidence of a track record of proceedings before the Arbitrazh Court involving investment disputes brought against Respondent. Although this is explained on the basis that there have been none, the more important point is that the onus is not on Respondent to prove the availability and efficacy of its court systems to manage investor related disputes. Rather, the onus is on Claimant to show, on sufficient evidence, that such recourse is unavailable or would be futile *in respect of the matters at issue in this case*, including in relation to this party and to matters in dispute.\"135\n\nAward, para. 8.1.15.\n\n186.\n\nAccording to Applicant, the test set by the Tribunal to prove the ineffectiveness of recourse to the local courts is set at a level of evidence that by the Tribunal's own terms would be practically impossible to meet: that evidence needs to be \"in respect of the matters at issue in this case\" notwithstanding the Tribunal's acknowledgement that there is \"no [\u2026] lead evidence of a track record of proceedings before the Arbitrazh Court involving investment dispute brought against Respondent. Although this is explained on the basis that there have been none [\u2026].\"136 Lack of evidence in support of an argument of a party does not necessarily mean that the tribunal treated the parties differently. The ineffectiveness of the courts was a matter to be proven by Applicant, not Respondent. It is a question of who carries the burden of proof rather than whether the Tribunal had treated the Parties fairly.\n\n*Id*. para. 8.1.15.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal could have been more inclined to look with a critical eye to the paper evidence presented by Respondent in view of the criticism of third party reports of highly reputable institutions submitted by Claimant, at least in the case of the EBRD, an institution whose objective among others is to strengthen the rule of law in countries such as Turkmenistan. But the Committee is not in a position to second-guess the Tribunal's decision and Claimant was responsible for proving its contention. The Tribunal, based on the evidentiary record, was not able \"to conclude that it would have been ineffective or futile for Claimant to have sought to comply with Article VII.2's requirement for prior recourse to the courts of Turkmenistan.\"137\n\n*Id.* para. 8.1.21.\n\n188.\n\nTo conclude, the Committee finds that Applicant has not proven that the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n*2. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION ON COSTS*\n-------------------------------------\n\nA. *Summary of the Positions of the Parties*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nApplicant contends that the Tribunal provided contradictory and insufficient or inadequate reasons for its decision on costs. In support, Applicant refers to the Tribunal's statement that Claimant asserted far-reaching claims but at the beginning of the proceeding the Tribunal decided that the jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent did not require bifurcation. Furthermore, the Tribunal recognized that Article VII.2 was an unsettled question and yet, according to the Tribunal, Applicant \"should have regarded the possibility that Article VII.2 of the BIT was requiring mandatory recourse to local courts.\"138\n\nMemorial, para. 386.\n\n190.\n\nApplicant refers to the Tribunal blaming Applicant for not explaining its decision not to seek to comply with the provisions of Article VII.2. Applicant argues that it believed in good faith that recourse to the local courts was optional and \"advanced extensive practical considerations why it would have been futile or counter-productive to exercise this judicial recourse all of which were rejected but not considered to be made in bad faith.\"139\n\n*Id.* para. 387.\n\n191.\n\nApplicant pleads that the costs part of the Award be annulled for failure to state reasons or manifest excess of powers even if the rest of the Award is not annulled.\n\n192.\n\nRespondent refers to the wide discretion of the Tribunal under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and to the decisions of annulment committees in the *MINE* and *CDC* cases, and concludes that \"[i]n light of this standard practice, it appears doubtful that the Tribunal's award on costs, rendered in accordance with its discretionary power under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, could be annulled on the grounds of manifest excess of powers or failure to state reasons.\"140\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 274.\n\n193.\n\nRespondent contends that, in any event, the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers or failed to provide reasons. Respondent explains that the Tribunal reasoned as follows: (i) the Tribunal referred to the provisions of Article 61(2), (ii) the Tribunal noted that each of the Parties had asked the Tribunal to exercise discretion in its favor, (iii) the Tribunal noted that Applicant disregarded entirely the possibility that the requirement to have first recourse to the local courts under Article VII.2 may not be optional, (iv) the Tribunal also noted that, after the decision of the Tribunal on the meaning of Article VII.2, Applicant did not explain its decision not to comply with said article, (v) the Tribunal also noted that that it was not evident that Applicant's request complied fully with the notice requirements of Article VII.2, (vi) the Tribunal considered that in these circumstances Applicant exercised a right \"on the basis of an expectation that there would be potentially serious challenges to jurisdiction or admissibility,\"141 (vii) hence the Tribunal considered that Applicant should bear some of the consequences of its actions.\n\n*Id.* para. 275, fifth bullet.\n\n194.\n\nRespondent also refers to the Request for Arbitration where Applicant recognized that the BIT mandatorily requires prior submission of a dispute to national courts and knowingly chose not to comply with this requirement.\n\nB. *Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nTribunals have, under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, ample discretion in deciding how to allocate costs of the arbitration. The Tribunal provided reasons for its decision. Applicant questions some of the reasons, in particular (i) the reliance of the Tribunal on Applicant's far-reaching claims notwithstanding that the jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent did not require bifurcation; and (ii) the Tribunal's recognition that Article VII.2 of the BIT was an unsettled question and \"yet, considers that Claimant should have regarded the possibility that Article VII.2 of the BIT was requiring mandatory recourse to local courts.\"142\n\nMemorial, paras. 385 and 386.\n\n196.\n\nThe reason of \"far-reaching claims\" has to be seen in context and the time when the relevant statements were made. The Tribunal uses this expression in the Award at the end of the proceedings and in a sentence to indicate that, because the claims were far reaching, Applicant \"must have expected Respondent to take [them] seriously and to defend [them] accordingly.\"143 The Tribunal would not have been in a position to qualify the claims as far reaching at the time it considered the bifurcation request. Furthermore, the Tribunal decided not to bifurcate the proceeding because it could result in undue cost and delay and two of the jurisdictional objections appeared \"intertwined with issues and evidence that may relate to the merits of the case.\"144 Far reaching claims may be intertwined with issues and evidence that may relate to the merits. There is no contradiction between the two.\n\nAward, para. 9.2.6.\n\nDecision on Bifurcation, p. 2.\n\n197.\n\nApplicant considers the qualification by the Tribunal of a question as \"unsettled\" to contradict the Tribunal's statement that Applicant should have regarded the possibility of a mandatory requirement to local courts. It would seem logical to the Committee that, if a question is unsettled, the Parties would be aware of either possible outcome and act accordingly; particularly, when in the Request for Arbitration Applicant itself seems to have understood differently Article VII.2 of the BIT.\n\n198.\n\nTo conclude, the Committee finds no merit in the claim that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its power or failed to provide reasons in its decision on costs in the Award.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n199.\n\nApplicant requests that\n\na. in case the Award is annulled, the Tribunal order Respondent to bear the entirety of Applicant's legal fees and the costs of the annulment proceeding;\n\nb. in the alternative and assuming that the Award is annulled, the Tribunal order Respondent to bear the entirety of the costs of the annulment proceeding;\n\nc. in a third alternative, and assuming that the Award is not annulled, the Tribunal order each Party to bear its own legal costs, and the costs of the annulment proceeding split in equal parts between the Parties; and\n\nd. in a fourth alternative, and assuming that the Award is not annulled, the Tribunal does not order the shifting of Respondent's legal costs to Applicant.,\n\n200.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent requests an award of costs in respect of all the costs incurred in connection with this proceeding, including the Tribunal's legal fees and expenses and the costs of its representation.\n\n201.\n\nAs provided in Applicant's statement of costs, dated May 29, 2015, Applicant's paid legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with this proceeding amount to EUR 532,231.99, USD 364,526.45, TRY 20,129.04 and GBP 219.73USD, including USD 360,000.00 paid to ICSID on account of the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the ICSID facilities.\n\n202.\n\nAccording to Respondent's statement of costs, dated 29 May 2015, Respondent's legal fees and expenses amount to USD 920,651.98.\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal's fees and expenses as well as the charges for the use of the ICSID facilities have been paid out of the advances made by Applicant and amount to USD 282,296.70, divided as follows (in USD):\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses: USD 208,699.71\n\nICSID's administrative charges: USD 64,000.00\n\nICSID's expenses (estimated):145 USD 9,596.99\n\nThe amount includes estimated charges (courier, printing and copying) in respect of the dispatch of this Decision.\n\n204.\n\nArticle 52 (4) of the ICSID Convention provides that the provisions of Chapters VI and VII shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings before the Committee. According to Rule 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, \"the provisions of these Rules shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to any procedure relating to the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award and to the decision of the Tribunal or Committee.\"\n\n205.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\n[t]he Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings and shall decide how and by whom these expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n206.\n\nArticle 61 of the ICSID Convention gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n207.\n\nRule 47(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that the Tribunal's Award \"shall contain [\u2026] (j) any decision [\u2026] regarding the cost of the proceeding.\"\n\n208.\n\nAlthough the Committee has found no ground for annulment, the issues raised by Applicant had sufficient merit for the Committee to decide in the exercise of its discretion that each Party shall bear in full its own legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings and that Applicant shall bear the Committee's fees and expenses and ICSID's charges for the use of its facilities.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n209.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee decides:\n\n(a) to dismiss the Application in its entirety;\n\n(b) that Applicant shall bear all charges for the use of the ICSID facilities in connection with this proceeding and the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee; and\n\n(c) that each party shall bear its own litigation costs and expenses incurred with respect to this proceeding."}]}
